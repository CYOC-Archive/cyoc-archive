<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today had the release of Beth, she leaving by way of the rear door almost slipped away without even myself taking notice.<br />
<br />
Beth, now in her late twenties, and because of her exceedingly long term within the drug testing, she retained some of the physical ammenities accociated with animals.<br />
<br />
After her giving me some arguement why she would not prefer to talk about her experience; I recieved a phone call from her a day later. As she had reconsidered, her wish was to alert those who might think of doing the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Beth, and I entered the Experiment volunteer program only because of the alluring amounts of money they offered. When first accepting their offer, and having my own plans for the money they promised to pay; it would have bettered my future, considerably!<br />
<br />
Once I signed my name on the dotted line, the attitude changed, as those whom seemed friendly saw me then as simple property. Within the first hour I found myself stripped of clothing, poked and prodded by people saying they were doctors and the like.<br />
<br />
Soon enough I found myself laid across some wooden rack, my arms pointed to the floor and strapped into place. Face down, my head too became immobilized, strapped into a chin up, as leather cupped it, holding me in an uncomfortable manner.<br />
<br />
My waist lay over the far end of that rack, as straps drew my thighs up tighter forward, almost hugging my abdomin, as legs were stretched back, and feet placed in some steel container.<br />
<br />
I would ask what this was all about but those working on me and around me remained quiet, ignoring me as if again, I was then just something of a piece of property. Indeed I felt like my life had turned from one of being and individual, becoming as if a cog in the machinery of science.<br />
<br />
Uneasy about my situation, feeling a chill, a shivered and goose pimple spread just everywhere. It was a middle aged woman, maybe she was a nurse, I never found out, but her seeing me as so uncomfortable, did talk to me.<br />
<br />
She was the only person there who announced to me that my life was soon to change. The testing soon to commence, would as she put it, transition by cell structure, asserting upon me the total form one an animal, as such I was to become a Donkey.<br />
<br />
The fact of my human form being as said, told of becoming an animal and then used for drug testing alarmed me. I struggled then to become released, forgetting what I signed, and asked repeatedly for them to stop and let me go home.<br />
<br />
My pleading was met with a monster syringe, it jammed into my breasts, first the right one and then the left. They swelled instantly, becoming painful. As if adding insult to my injury, the two that were Doctors and three I considered as nurses all in one swoop poked me with five injections.<br />
<br />
One went in my buttock, another shot into my vagina, the others went into both shoulders, and the final was the worst as it reached up inside one nostril of my nose. To their sudden attack I let out a scream and then feeling dull of feelings, becoming limp, I blacked out.<br />
<br />
When first I awoke out of my shock, opening the eyes slowly, I peeked out cautiously. <br />
<br />
Standing and supported about the waist by a wide leather strap, I found myself trussed up in a odd position. My arms were shackled about the wrists, held high above my head, as other chains kept me from wandering or taking anything more than a step at all.<br />
<br />
Feeling every so queezy, my stomac growling like I had nothing to eat for some amount of time. My head ached, and felt oddly heavy. My vision seemed blurry, except when those working around me came within, say twenty feet or closer.<br />
<br />
When any of them did come close they smiled, chuckled, or laughed out right at my predicment. To this I tried to speak and tell them of my insult to all they had done, but words and speech ability were gone.<br />
<br />
Straining then to make any sound that told these people how I felt, my screams took on a familiar tone.<br />
<br />
Dragging in a breath across dull and funny feeling vocal cords made this horrindous, squealing screech of a long drawn out HEEEEEEE!<br />
<br />
As terrible it sounded even to me, I exhaled upon hearing it and again the vocal cords took to vibrating, sending forth a ragged sound as on long Haw, sound.<br />
<br />
My lack of the ability to speak made me excited and for the next few hours I continuously made the natural donkey call, Hee-Haw, Heeeee-Haw, and so on until my thoat became sore.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it and how I might have thought to check out my physical form, the screaming filled my brain with primal patterns, I thought on simple things.<br />
<br />
Feeding time happened, the one older nurse came close holding a large baby bottle filled with yellow colored milk. As she held it up high I reached my head to it, lips reaching as would a donkey for its delights.<br />
<br />
Wrapping my lips about the large nipple I worked them as one might fingers, squeezing the milky substance into my hungry mouth.<br />
<br />
It was my first round of subconscience training as for some years to come I would use my leps as finger to gather in grass, hay, and grain. The learning process was aided by my lips expanding, thickening as my mouth and jaw lengthened into the head of a true donkey.<br />
<br />
At certain times my mind became quite alert; allowing me as I stood there to take some inventory of how my body was changing. My stance was first and easy to see, as seeing black hoofs that replace toes, made me cry.<br />
<br />
Blurry eyes, tears streaming down my transtioning face, I strained to look down, wanting to remember my self as I was once, human.<br />
<br />
Hoofs, then fetlock bones and joints proper for a donkey to walk and run. My feet gained length, yet narrowed to shaft bone and tendons, as on it the skin had turned black and sprouted dark hairs.<br />
<br />
Seeing this brought odd suggestive thoughts and I stomped the hoofs on the floor. The sound seemed as if it were something nice, a pattern of this than over and over in my thoughts.<br />
<br />
A good morning announcemnt from one of the doctors awakened me; as he thought to explain some of what I would soon experience. His considerate manners and short speech made me anxious, becoming then excited, and turned to sounding off with a long stream of Hee-Haws.<br />
<br />
This made him scoff and laugh at me, telling me that my volunteering' was just beginning. They, the doctors there had decided to test their &quot;Reformation Drug&quot; coupled with a newer virus, together they would arrange my cell structure not just to that of an animal and Donkey, but would and was changing my gender as well.<br />
<br />
Laughingly, he told me of their desire to learn if the human spirit could continue to exist after a total change of species occured. The second item they wanted to learn was if my mental awareness might be preserved after I changed sex, becoming a Jackass of Donkeism.<br />
<br />
It was with this my mind screamed for help, Hee-Hawing voilently.<br />
<br />
His smile suggested evil intents, as he reached out and fingered my already grown donkey sheath.<br />
<br />
The touch of him upon the sensual folds of the sheath sent me into male realms of equine responses. The new sensation of becoming erect, I actually began to sweat, felling the organ rise up, stiffening, swelling, becoming rigid and rock hard.<br />
<br />
Some instinct forced me to rock my pelvic region, as if thrusting the monster up and into a waiting void. <br />
<br />
Thinking clouded, one idea took total control, It being to me a must!<br />
<br />
Rocking my rear, legs spread apart, the leather strap suspending me in a rather proper position for mating as would and equine, I began to ooze and spit forth white juices, cum I think men call it. Then after seven hard thrusts and as the Doctor cupped his hands about the flared end of my new donkey's cock, I erupted.<br />
<br />
The rank smell filled my changing nostrils. It made a thought memory pattern, one that over the following years guided me to enjoy the mating process from a male attitude.<br />
<br />
Sperm, my first round of equine masturbation, one of thousands more that I would want to experience. When at last the urge had passed, I felt limp and exhausted, to this I was bottle fed again.<br />
<br />
This went on four times every day until from the sexual desire, my body followed the insisting drugs, making me change with haste and speed.<br />
<br />
The hind feet and hoofs were just the beginnings of things that changed. My legs and thighs bunched me into a hunched position, making the thighs broaden into those common to donkeys.<br />
<br />
My rump and rear was the first to accept the drugs and as buttocks became narrow, the anus puffed outward, a tail appendage sprouted. It hung down, the weight of it as much a sensual feeling, I learned to toy with it as something to make time pass.<br />
<br />
The bottle feedings continued for an eternity. I lost track of time, days weeks, and cared not to think of it at all. In fact my thinking had turned the corner, I thought nothing of my future, just the moment!<br />
<br />
As my head expanded, growing, face becoming a muzzle, nose, nostrils merging with my upper lip. The nostrils and lips made for another toy to play with, reaching for the bottle and working it the strong lips were donkey by then. My deep breaths expanded the nostrils in size and with this filled human lungs, making them except changes too.<br />
<br />
Ribs expanded both in size and numbers. My spine poped and snapped as bones adjusted and new ones grew into place. As neck gained length, mass, and great strength, the bones growing into place as thoart lengthened, making for a time swallowing even milk an ordeal.<br />
<br />
I awoke one morning confused, laid out my those other creatures, they placing me in a wooden stall, the floor covered in chips of wood.<br />
<br />
My thinking and knowledge of me and the surroundings faded from human like understandings, to bestial instincts over safety, and embodied senses of calm.<br />
<br />
Snorting often, tail swishing and giving off its own sensual delights, I braying my thoughts and passions, gave the doctors something to chuckle about. I had slipped the bonds of human form and life, allowing via contact and allurement for money my real self to be degraded into a lower form of life, a Donkey.<br />
<br />
Life and living came as a day to day experience. My learning of how to be first an animal, a Donkey, and then to understand what it is to become a male and Stud.<br />
<br />
Over the next few months my days seemd as an eternity, left in the stall, my body, muscles, and tendons all were firming up. When first walked out of the stall I felt nervous, as if being taken from my own private little world.<br />
<br />
Placed into a dusty corral, I had room to trot, and canter like does equines. My muscular body truned tougher from this and over another month or so I felt more musculin, feeling the passion to be as they would remind me often saying, &quot;Hi Stud!&quot;<br />
<br />
The word STUD, left a mark in my mind. As much as I understood its meanings from a human language point of view, my male donkey body was having pangs to mate. The sensation and desire to masturbate myself came more often, I know it happened a dozen times each day.<br />
<br />
Medical testing happed but my memories from that time dwelled on sexual sensations, lusts for the sweet scents that filled the air, that of willing, needing mares, and Jennies.<br />
<br />
Tyco was my first real conquest, she a gray haired donkey like me, but as I was told had some Oriental ways.<br />
<br />
I had become harsh, brutal in many of my actions and ways.<br />
<br />
She being of Oriental culture came on to me soft, warmly, and with much expression from sensaul touching. It quelled my brutal ambitions, making me as clay before the potter, I was willingly hers do do it as she asked.<br />
<br />
Once I mounted her our mutual braying in soft and friendly tones made those watching scoff and laugh. Stabding as upright as my hind legs would allow, I tried to remain calm, keeping my throbbing cock still and as I aimed blindly.<br />
<br />
Five stabbing thrusts, then she made a move below me as my cockhead touch her welcoming lips. Feeling the flared head press into her moisted vulva, spreading the lips of skin, and entering, I screamed a bray of conquest.<br />
<br />
My feelings for becoming as a male had to that time only felt the sense of release of the pented up semen. Now, the reality of mating came to rooste, I really enjoyed pressing into her that new cock. The deeper it went my mind compared with previous times, when college men took me to bed. In as much I longed to be female, my male donkey brain was insisting the mating find enjoyment from the male point of view.<br />
<br />
Tyco was great and I in turn was nice to her. We mated several times that day, the memories of it still vivid in my minds eye. Her time there was shorter than mine as when her father discovered where his daughter had disappeared to, he bought her away from the research company. The reason I know of this is she reminded a donkey for two years, being my foal, nursing it into maturity, then transitioned back to her original self. She came to visit me, asking about me, I listened to her wanting to buy me and take me home to her Japan. <br />
<br />
Of course her wishes were denied, and from that time I never saw her again. If I can find her somehow, I want to renew or friendship.<br />
<br />
It was from our relationship of that one day my years of being a Donkey Jack, at stud, found worth. I mated with mares, ponies, donkeys, zebra, and all types of equines both large and small. The doctors used me as a four leged sex machine, making new species of equine creatures, some as oddities, sold to collectors at great amounts of money.<br />
<br />
The names announced to me of changlings such as I, or real animals born of animals, they having names but thinking only of feeling the pangs of beastly life.<br />
<br />
I signed a contract for five years of volunteer work; had it not been your inquiring about those of us inside, I would have remained a donkey Jack until death.<br />
<br />
Nine years now since I walked willingly inside the front doors to that financial kingdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was her story, one of deciept and doom!<br />
<br />
As we sat on her parents front porch the question posed by me started her off again. I asked of Tyco and just how she thought the two young women might find a loving relationship?<br />
<br />
Her response came quick and to the point.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dearest Tyco will be quite friendly once she discovers that I am not of the Donkey form anymore. Yet as those men of medicine did to me they removed my humanity, allowing me to return. The transition they made upon me to male, remains, I still have the tail, balls, and sheath with a donkey Jack penis, this all to thrill and satisfy Tyco!&quot;</p>
