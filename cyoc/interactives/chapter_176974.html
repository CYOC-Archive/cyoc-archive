<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cal and Luka breached the tree line and came upon the sandy flood plains of a wide and shallow river. They made their way towards a group of nude men standing knee deep in the water, apparently bathing. One of them waved to Luka as they approached, and Luka returned the wave enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
“My birth-father is a lot les dour than my father,” he said to Cal. “You’ll like him.” <br />
<br />
The three men resembled Koda and Luka in that they too were very large, hairy, and muscular men. However, their bodies were slimmer, the muscles having a leaner definition. They were quite as hairy as the other men Cal had encountered, though unlike Koda or Luka their faces were clean shaven despite their wild manes of hair. The tallest and oldest among them, an athletic looking man with his red hair in a bun and laugh lines on his face, stepped forward and took Luka in a strong embrace. <br />
<br />
“Luka, my son! We were just about to go fishing,” the tall man said, releasing Luka. His brow furrowed when he noticed Cal. “Who’s your little friend?”<br />
<br />
“A lost human,” giggled Luka. “Paw said he could work with you guys for the day in exchange for enough supplies to make it to port tomorrow.” Luka pushed Cal forward. “Cal, this is my birth father, Palo.”<br />
<br />
The tall man shook Cal’s hand roughly.<br />
<br />
“Of to your work then, boy,” he lightly chided his son, “I’ll keep this human busy.”<br />
<br />
Luka gave Cal a toothy grin, “See you at camp tonight, human.” He said before running off, pausing only to give Cal a slap on the ass before tearing off into the brush. <br />
<br />
“Have you bathed today, human?” Palo said behind him, tearing Cal’s eyes away from the brush. He turned to see palo still standing naked before him, sunlight reflecting off of his damp, hairy skin. Cal tried to avert his eyes from the man’s large hanging manhood.<br />
<br />
“Um, no. It’s been…its been a weird morning.” Cal muttered, still uncertain. He was suddenly feeling very self-conscious about his own new male body around these large, naked hirsute men. <br />
<br />
“Come join us in the river. Snowmelt season is over and the water is perfect,” he said, turning to pad back to the other men at the river. “You can leave you’re clothes under the tree,” he said over his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Cal hesitated at first but, he didn’t want to upset the people that might be helping him. Were they people? He still wasn’t sure. He padded over to the tree and stripped out of the old linen trousers, once again taken aback at the sight of his body. His muscular, hairy thighs, his big feet. He looked down his flat, hairy chest, down to the large flaccid cock and hairy balls hanging from his crotch. It still felt so alien to him; the weight, the way they moved and flopped in his trousers. But is strange and new as it was, the shock seemed to have passed. I’m even referring to myself as a ‘he’, he thought. <br />
<br />
Cal strode up to the river’s edge; the water moved at a leisurely pace over a bed of small, mossy stones. He stuck his foot in; it was a little bracing from the morning chill, but it felt good against his aching feet. He strode into the water, gasping when his balls dipped below the cold surface. Palo and the other men had moved into the deeper part of the water, and Cal quickly joined them. <br />
<br />
“Glad you joined us, my little friend.” said Palo. He gestured to the other two. “These are my brothers, Eben,” he gestured to a man of medium build with a thick head of brown hair, “and Ledo,” he gestured to the smallest of the trio, with a lithe build and short-cropped bronze hair. <br />
<br />
“A human? Is he here for dinner, or is he here for dinner?” the dark-haired man laughed, before dunking his shaggy head into the water.<br />
<br />
“Don’t listen to him. He’s all bear and no bite.” Said the smaller one, Ledo. He dipped below the surface to his shoulders. “So, human,” he began. “Where are you from?”<br />
<br />
“Um…Modesto?” he said, taking his wet hands and running them through his hair. He noticed his hair wasn’t as long as it was before, but it felt thicker and softer. <br />
<br />
“I’ve never heard of that place,” said Eben.<br />
<br />
“Is that some new human settlement out east?” asked Ledo, popping back up out of the water. Cal caught himself staring at the way the water ran across the man’s chest.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but its kind of a dump,” Cal replied. He was still staring at the young man’s muscly chest. He felt a strange tightening at his groin, but ignored it for the moment.<br />
<br />
“I suppose that’s why you left. I’m sorry to hear you were robbed.” said Palo.<br />
<br />
“You were robbed?” exclaimed Ledo.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, they took everything; I didn’t even have clothes. Good thing Luka found me.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, he’s a good boy,” said Palo, his face beaming with pride for his son. “Eben, lets you and I try our luck fishing down at the bend. Ledo, you and Cal seemed to have hit it off: he can give you a helping hand today. Keep him busy, and don’t fool around!” he said sternly. <br />
<br />
Ledo lowered his eyes and replied, “Yes, Ursa. Good fishing.”<br />
<br />
“Good hunting,” they both replied, and together the two men strode from the water. <br />
<br />
“Looks like you’re with me today,” said Ledo when they departed the shoreline. “Funny, I don’t think I’ve met a human before.” He spoke. Cal was starting to notice how handsome this young man was. <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve never met a werebear before,” replied Cal. “Or a were anything.”<br />
<br />
“Not a lot of beast-men out where you’re from?” <br />
<br />
“No, uh…it’s just regular men and women.” Cal said.<br />
<br />
“Men and what?” Ledo looked confused. Cal wasn’t sure what was confusing.<br />
<br />
“Men and women? You know, people?” he elaborated.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never head of these women before. Are they a kind of elf?” Ledo began making his way out of the water.<br />
<br />
“What? No.” Cal followed after him, “Dude, I know you’ve been out here in the woods with all these men for a while, but seriously?” as Ledo stepped from the water, Cal noticed the young man’s full, round ass and suddenly lost his words. His back was broad and strong, but his narrow waist leading down to one of the most beautiful asses Cal had ever seen on a man. It made him feel a kind of hunger, and as he stared at the nimble young man stepping out of the water he felt his new cock between his legs stir and harden.<br />
<br />
“I honestly don’t know what you’re talking about, I…” but he trailed off when he turned around and caught Cal staring. Cal blushed and turned away; she’d always hated when she’d caught a man ogling her and now here HE was carelessly ogling this sexy young man firm, perfectly hairy ass.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Cal muttered, looking down and shocking himself with the sight of his semi-hard cock. It looked enormous to Cal’s fresh eyes, definitely bigger than anything Cally had dealt with before. He felt a weird twinge of pride at that. <br />
<br />
“Don’t be. Its nice to see you human men are almost as well-endowed as our own.” Ledo smiled and padded up to Cal, who gulped and covered his growing dick with his big hands. Despite his unfamiliarity, his uncertainty, he could feel his dick growing harder behind his hands. Ledo came before him, putting one arm over his shoulder, while the other slunk down to remove Cal’s hand from his cock.<br />
<br />
“Don’t hide it; you’re a beautiful man, my friend.” said Ledo, and Cal laughed but felt a surge of strength and confidence at the young man’s words. He hadn’t taken a moment yet to see what he looked like as a man. Then Ledo wrapped his hand around Cal’s hard cock and he gasped at the man’s slender fingers ran along his hard length, playing along the tip. Cal wrapped his own arm around Ledo’s waist and gripped it with a strength that surprised him as Ledo began to slowly massage his hard member.<br />
<br />
“That feels amazing…” he breathed into the man’s ear. His other hand reached around to that firm ass he had been ogling only a minute ago; he gave it a strong, firm grip, feeling his heart race and his cock throb as he did so. <br />
<br />
Ledo giggled, “Work can wait, my friend. Let’s enjoy the morning.” He said. He pulled Cal by the hand, and by the dick, over to a patch of grass under a tree. They sat down on the ground, Cal noticing the man’s cock was full mast, big and thick with a narrow head. When they sat, Ledo put his hand on Cal’s chest and pushed his back to the grass before climbing on top of him and delivering a strong and passionate kiss. At first, Cal melted in the young man’s embrace, enjoying the alien sensations of his new beard scratching against the younger man’s smooth cheeks. But as they kissed and fondled each other Cal started to feel a strong passion in himself. He gripped the man’s head firmly and began to kiss back with a little more force, luxuriating in the sensation of the man’s smooth lips and his rough tongue against his own. His hand drifted down to the small of Ledo’s back, holding onto him as their cock’s rubbed and mashed together between them. Suddenly, Cal did something that surprised both of them: he quickly and ever-so-roughly flipped Ledo on his back with himself on top. Ledo gasped for second before Cal dived down onto him, kissing him with fierce purpose. His hand reach down and took hold of their two cocks, jerking them together lightly as they continued to make out. His dick throbbed and strained in his hand; he could feel his heavy balls heaving between his legs. He felt powerful and alive, so much different from his experiences with sex in the past. Something was building up inside of him, and as one of his hands drifted down to again caress Ledo’s firm bottom, he began to get an idea of what it was. His thoughts of money and home and what the hell had happened to him were all driven away as his male instincts began to take over. <br />
<br />
Ledo wrapped his legs around Cal’s waist as they continued to fondle and make out, and as they shifted around, Cal felt his cock drift down and slap against the entrance to Ledo’s ass. Curiously, Cal stopped and reached a tentative finger down to where his cock was resting. His hand reached underneath Ledo’s hairy balls and down to his ass, where he began to lightly touch and prod with his thick finger. Ledo moaned, and Cal was surprised to find that Ledo was wet; it felt slick and oily.<br />
<br />
“You’re wet,” he breathed against Ledo’s ear.<br />
<br />
“All because of you, my friend,” he sighed in return. “You can fuck me, if you’d like.” He said, leaning his head forward to kiss and nibble at Cal’s neck. Cal wanted to moan, but the sound that rumbled from his throat was more like a guttural growl. He wants me to fuck him, Cal thought. His cock was so hard, and Ledo looked so beautiful and perfect lying beneath him against the grass that he didn’t even stop to reflect on what he was doing.<br />
<br />
“I think I do,” Cal said, his hand reaching down again to probe Ledo’s anus. It was soft, warm, and slick; it made his cock throb and his balls ache. He wanted to fuck Ledo, Cal realized, and he wanted to fuck him hard. He continued to finger Ledo’s ass, adding another finger, and then another while contentedly watching the young man’s face contort and twist in pleasure. Finally he removed his fingers and wrapped them around the base of his dick like he had seen his boyfriends do in the past. Boy if they could see me now, thought Cal with devilish pleasure. He pressed his cock against the Ledo’s ass and pushed, feeling a moment of resistance and then a pop and a gasp from Ledo as the head of his cock slipped in. Cal moaned and bowed his head over his new lover as his throbbing cock was engulfed by Ledo’s warm, tight ass. He continued to push himself in, luxuriating in the sensation until he felt his pelvis press up against Ledo’s thighs. Cal held himself there for a moment; the feeling was so exquisite and he knew enough not to waste it being a two-pump chump. Satisfied that he was ready, Cal put one hand on Ledo’s thigh and began to thrust, slowly at first. He moaned as ever inch of his hard cock was caressed and massaged by Ledo’s insides. Ledo’s muscles flexed around his cock as Cal began to pick up his pace. Cal’s mind was awash with all the new sensations; the weight of his balls as they slapped against Ledo’s ass with each thrust, the way his pleasure seemed to pulsate from and center around his cock, and how Ledo’s whimpers and moans made him feel powerful and virile. He began fucking Ledo as hard as he could, one hand holding the man’s thigh while the other snaked around his large cock and began to furiously jerk him off. Cal could feel his pleasure reaching its zenith. The feeling of pleasure became sharp and powerful at the tip of his cock before his aching balls churned and he came. Cal let out a deep growl, bowing his head against Ledo as he came as a man for the first time. His cock pulsed and throbbed as it shot load after load of his cum deep inside of him. Cal felt Ledo’s own cock throb in his hand and the muscles in his ass clench against his cock repeatedly. He realized Ledo had come as well, and Cal gripped the man tightly against his chest as they came down from their orgasm. For the first time Cal was starting to feel at home in his body; he felt natural and comfortable.<br />
<br />
They held each other tight as they lay in the grass, Cal’s cock slowly growing soft inside of Ledo as he kissed the young man softly. He was shocked when he felt fur, and pulled back to see Ledo’s face was now furry. His nose and jaw had pulled forward slightly to make the beginnings of a muzzle; his nose was black and wet, and his ears had become furry and slightly pointed. If Cal wasn’t lost in a post-orgasmic stupor, he would have jumped away, but in his haze he could only chuckle and kiss him again. <br />
<br />
“Why are you furry?” he asked, running his hand along Ledo’s jawline. The fur was the same bronze color as his hair.<br />
<br />
Ledo’s eyes fluttered open and he felt his face. “Oh, shit,” he said, flashing a much longer and sharper set of canines. “I’m sorry; I must have shifted a bit from the exertion.” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, apparently trying to concentrate. “I don’t have the energy right now to change back. Do you mind?’ He asked, looking up at him with clear blue eyes from his fury face. <br />
Cal kissed him on his lips, “Don’t worry about it. I’ve had to take a lot in stride today,” he said, his cock throbbing from inside of Ledo’s ass. <br />
<br />
“Now we have to bathe in the river again,” Ledo commented while Cal continued to run his hands over the man’s body. The fur had grown in thick all over him, Cal noticed, but it was slowly receding.<br />
<br />
“And we should probably do those chores at some point, as well.” Cal replied. He began to pull himself out, shuddering at the sensation. When he was released, he rolled onto the grass beside Ledo. Cal reached down to his legs and hefted his cock experimentally, running his hands down his length and along his balls. It had felt so disturbingly alien this morning and now, it felt like an indispensable part of him.<br />
<br />
Ledo sat up and stretched, shaking his head and his body until his fur receded and his face settled back into a more human shape. Cal could only lay there for a moment, admiring the man’s lean muscular body as he continued to stroke his dick. He was still shocked at himself, at how quickly he’d taken control and decided to have sex with this man whom he barely knew. His cock began to get harder at the thought of going for another round. But Ledo had already stood up and started to approach the river. He turned to Cal and waved him over.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, big man. Lets wash ourselves off and get this work over with so we can have some more fun tonight!” he said, flashing a grin that made Cal’s heart skip a beat. He stood up and jogged after him, and feeling strangely mischievous, he quickly broke into a run and tackled the man into the water before Ledo knew what hit him. They emerged from the water laughing and splashing before returning to their ablutions, and for the first time since he had woke up that morning, Cal was feeling truly good.</p>
