<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom was silent. He didn&#39;t respond to Kate&#39;s question. He was also deathly pale. At least he wasn’t resisting. Kate continued to hold Kerry&#39;s shoes in place. After several minutes she was able to slip them properly onto Tom’s now smaller feet. Kate and Kerry smiled at each other. The socks were doing what the socks did.<br />
<br />
“I’ll watch him while you get undressed. Use my robe hanging on the wardrobe door” Kate instructed Kerry. Kerry left the husband and wife and moved off to the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
Tom was silent until his changes were evident above the top of the socks. He finally spoke “It’s happening. I’m becoming Kerry”<br />
<br />
“Yes you will soon be Kerry and heading off to the big game. What did you say the name of the debutant is?” Kate wanted to distract him<br />
<br />
“Scott Nicholson”<br />
<br />
“And what’s his position?”<br />
<br />
“Forward”<br />
<br />
“You should get a great view of the game from the corporate box. Where did you say the box was?”<br />
<br />
“On the wing right next to the coach boxes”<br />
<br />
Kate kept him talking about football as the changes spread up his legs. Tom was wearing baggy shorts so there was no need to get him undressed. His legs became hairless and feminine up to the hem of his shorts. Kate calculated that in another 5 minutes Tom would be a she. She kept the discussion happening about the football as Tom slowly recovered from his apparent shock.<br />
<br />
Kerry returned now clad only in Kate’s bathrobe. “How’s it going?”  she asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m doing it. I’m becoming you” Tom replied.<br />
<br />
“It’s no big deal” Kate reminded him. “The changes are easily reversed. You will be yourself again tomorrow morning” <br />
<br />
“I know. Don’t worry. I’m committed now. Looking forward to an evening at the football” Tom was still trying to convince himself.<br />
<br />
Both Kate and Kerry were relieved to hear him say that. <br />
<br />
“The tingling has almost reached my groin” <br />
<br />
“Are your shorts getting tight?”<br />
<br />
“No they are fine. They have and elastic band. What sort of flower is it and does it mean anything?”<br />
<br />
“Do you mean my tattoo?”<br />
<br />
“My tattoo now as well”<br />
<br />
“It’s and orchid. I had it done when I was 19. On a night out with the college girls. I’m not sure if I like it anymore or not. My whole group of friends got a tattoo that night. I think I gave into peer pressure and wanting to conform. It doesn’t mean anything special just a reminder of a night of overindulgence. I rarely see those girls anymore”<br />
<br />
“I like it. It’s different” said Tom<br />
<br />
“Would you like a drink at all while your changes continue?” asked Kate<br />
<br />
“Yeah a beer would be nice. You don’t drink beer do you Kerry? I guess I need to know what you do like”<br />
<br />
“White wine or champagne. I’m happy to have a cocktail but be careful I’m a one drink screamer”<br />
<br />
“And any food allergies or anything else I should know about?”<br />
<br />
“No allergies. I don’t like pickles or olives though”<br />
<br />
“No pickles or olives then”<br />
<br />
“And don’t order a big steak. It would be out of character. Choose a lighter meal if there is a choice”<br />
<br />
“Anything else I should know?”<br />
<br />
“If anyone asks your favourite player is Jack Coleman and your all time favourite was Richo. You have always had a crush on Richo and Michael knows that”<br />
<br />
“That was something I knew already. Michael once confided to me that he was your second choice and that you only agreed to marry him once Richo was taken”<br />
<br />
It was Kerry’s turn to blush “There’s an element of truth in there but Michael is my first choice”<br />
<br />
Kate returned with a glass of beer. Tom took a swallow. “I think I’m about to grow breasts. The tingling is up to my ribs&quot;<br />
<br />
“Won’t be much longer. Once you are finished you need to get dressed quickly and return home. A word of warning. The skirt doesn’t allow a lot of leg movement. Be aware of that when you are driving. Perhaps hitch it up so you can see your knees”<br />
<br />
“Do I wear these shoes when I drive?”<br />
<br />
“I do. The seat should be adjusted for driving in heels. But if you are worried you can take them off. Kate’s theory is that you will get my ability to walk in the heels. If so I think you will find no problems driving in them. Michael expects you home at 3.30. A taxi is coming at 4. You shouldn’t need to do anything there other than perhaps a visit to the toilet”<br />
<br />
Breasts were starting to push out Tom’s polo shirt was beginning to push outwards as his breasts budded. “Did you want to look?” asked Kate. “We can move to the mirror” <br />
<br />
“Yeah I think so. Say goodbye to my own face” Tom stood up and walked across to the mirror. He still had the heels on his feet. He had no trouble walking in them. He was only slightly taller than Kate now.<br />
<br />
While he still had his own face he still was &#39;Tom&#39; and despite lacking the anatomy identified as a male but he knew that wouldn&#39;t last much longer. The breasts grew to their full C-cups and Tom&#39;s shoulders narrowed. The voice changed when his Adam’s apple disappeared. Soon the chin hairs began to disappear, replaced by flawless make-up. When the lips developed a coat of gloss, the beer no longer tasted as nice, Tom’s now feminine voice told the others. “I guess I just became a wine drinker, I’ll pass on the rest of this”<br />
<br />
As with every swap so far, it was when Tom’s eyes changed that she essentially became Kerry. <br />
<br />
The girls left Tom alone once his/her face had changed. Kate wanted to show Kerry something. Tom watched her reflection as her hair grew then her arms and hands changed. The last thing to change were her fingernails. They had been red last weekend now they were shiny pink.</p>
