<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was after dinner and you're getting ready for your first night of hunting. You're excited about it though you're not sure why. Perhaps it's because you're a vampiress now. You had asked Sarah if you could get pregnant when she came back. She had said that you wouldn't get pregnant until you've hit vampiric puberty. You asked when that would be and Sarah had said it could start when you've been a vampiress for 11 years, when you start having your period. You're glad that you don't have to worry about having a period or getting pregnant for at least 11 years. That had brought up another question. Why turn people when vampiresses could get pregnant? Sarah had said that vampiress pregnancies are extremely rare.<br />
<br />
Alice was coming hunting with you and, after stopping by her room to get her some clothes for hunting, you two were in your room getting changed. Sarah came in and asked &quot;Are you two girls ready yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just about&quot; you answer slipping on a pair of sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here&quot; Alice says slipping on her own sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Sarah said, &quot;what we're going to do is stop by Violet's parent's. After that we'll go hunting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you Violet's mother now Head Council?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Sarah said, &quot;but remember that I turned her. The one who gave birth to her is still her mother as well. It would be rude not to acknowledge that. Violet wants to go see them and we will. Oh by the way Violet, Brian is coming with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your face lights up when you hear this. You had been hoping that Brian would come along. You suddenly remember that Alice would be there too and it might not be a good time for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know what you're thinking&quot; Alice said. &quot;It's true that I'll be sad but I don't want it to ruin your happiness. I'm sure that I'll find someone to replace Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't think like that&quot; you say as you place your hand on Alice's shoulder. &quot;No one can replace Danny. You loved him and you always will. You'll never forget him. Trust me, I know. Before I started dating Sarah I had another girlfriend who died in a car accident. I was devastated and sad for a long time but I finally decided to move on. When I decided to move on I wasn't looking to replace her. I was looking for someone that I could share my life with. I'll never forget her or the love we shared, just as I won't forget the love Sarah and I shared. It's true that Sarah is still here but the nature of our love has changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must have been a guy before&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because your sexual orientation stays the same&quot; Alice said. &quot;If you were straight before, you're straight now. If you were gay before, you're gay now. Since you're in love with Brian now and you had girlfriends before, it was a simple deduction that you were a guy before.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had blushed when Alice had said that you loved Brian. It must have been really obvious that you did.<br />
<br />
After a moment Alice said &quot;Thanks, you're a true friend Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now if you two girls are ready we should be going&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes drive you arrive at your parent's house. You start to feel a little nervous about letting them see you as a vampiress. You know your niece will think that it's neat that you are a vampiress and she's likely to want to be one too. Your sister will probably be a little freaked that you're a vampiress but you think that she'll be accepting of you being a girl. It was your sister dressing you up as a girl that started you thinking you should have been born a girl. Your mother will be pretty freaked out about this. You don't think you really convinced her that you were her son. Your step-father is going to be even tougher than your mother to convince. He is a police officer after all and as such he tends to be close minded on things like this. You take a deep breath as Sarah rings the bell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Samantha&quot; Sarah says when your mother opens the door. &quot;May we come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Sarah&quot; your mother answers. &quot;I'll let Tanya and Megan know that you're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You go in to the living room to see your step-father sitting in his chair watching the news. You had forgot that today was his day off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Lieutenant&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Sarah&quot; your step-father said, &quot;Sam said you would be dropping by with my step-son. Where is he at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you when Tanya and Megan are here&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hasn't been in an accident or hurt has he?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No he's fine&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why isn't he here?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that he is here&quot; your mother says coming into the living room with Tanya and Megan. &quot;Though you'll find that he is now a she.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; your step-father asks.<br />
<br />
Tanya came over to you and looked you in the eye. After a couple of seconds she said &quot;So you are a girl now. I guess I can't call you brother anymore. This is fantastic, I had always thought you should have been a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's why you dressed me up&quot; you say. &quot;Why didn't you tell me that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why I never did&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya, are you sure that this girl is my step-son?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am Dad&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if Tanya is convinced that you're my step-son that's good enough for me&quot; your step-father said. &quot;I would like to know how this happened though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made him like this sir&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see I'm a vampiress and the type of vampire that I am can turn someone to a different age and gender&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A vampire huh&quot; your step-father says pulling out a weird looking gun. &quot;Give me one reason not to stake all of you right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We mean you no harm&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's telling you the truth&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky that I have faith in my step-daughter's perception&quot; your step-father said as he put the gun down. &quot;Now suppose you tell me what you know about the vampire killings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All I really know is that my clan did not kill anyone&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We secrete an enzyme that keeps people alive even if we drain their blood completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's telling the truth&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She may believe that none of her clan committed the murders but she can't be sure of that&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true, I can't be sure&quot; Sarah said. &quot;However I know that if one of our clan members drained the blood from someone, they would still be alive unless something else happened to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I believe you&quot; your step-father said. &quot;Now what do I call my new step-daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah gave me the name Violet&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so Violet it is&quot; your step-father said. &quot;Now, who are these two with you Violet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Alice&quot; you say gesturing to Alice, &quot;and this is Brian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Brian love each other don't you?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; you answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you've had sex with him?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; you answer knowing that he already knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you're honest about it&quot; your step-father said. &quot;Now ordinarily I would have gone through the roof if someone had had sex with my 13 year old step-daughter but this is different. You were an adult before and should know the consequences of having sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir, I do&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle I mean Aunt Violet&quot; Megan says, &quot;Grandma told us that you're a vampire now. Is that true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is Megan&quot; you say. &quot;Do you want to see my fangs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I would&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright come close&quot; you say. &quot;I'll open my mouth so you can see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You open your mouth and Megan looks inside. &quot;You don't have fangs&quot; she angrily says.<br />
<br />
You hold up a finger to signal Megan to wait. You wanted her to see your fangs slide out so she could have no doubts about them being real. You flex your fang muscles and they extend out of their hiding place. You see the look of surprise and excitement on Megan's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think of them?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're neat&quot; Megan says, &quot;you really are a vampire. Can you shape shift like vampires can in the movies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I can&quot; you say, &quot;though right now I can only turn into mist and a one piece bathing suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a natural ability to turn to mist but we must acquire everything else we turn into&quot; you say. &quot;So far the only thing that I've acquired is a one piece.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you turn into mist?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go one better than that&quot; you say, &quot;I'll turn you to mist with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know how to do that Violet&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; you say, &quot;Alice thought that I was joking earlier when I said we needed to mist into my room. I couldn't convince her otherwise so I took her in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true Head Council&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so Violet can do that&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Alice, when we're out of the clan house you will address me as Sarah or ma'am. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Megan&quot; you say, &quot;when we mist your vision will change. You'll be seeing from thousands of viewpoints and you'll be seeing 360 degrees around each viewpoint. Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Megan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, hold my hand tight&quot; you say. When Megan grabs your hand you mist and take her around the room a couple of times. &quot;How did you like that?&quot; you ask when you have reformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked it&quot; Megan said. &quot;I really want to be a vampire now. Could you turn me into a vampire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the only way to become the type of vampire we are is to have sex with one and then the vampire drains the blood&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I don't think your grandpa will approve of you having sex at 13.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I most certainly will not approve of it&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already had sex with Jason&quot; Megan said. &quot;He says that he's a vampire. He told me that he wants a vampire daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you describe him?&quot; Brian asked. After Megan had finished describing Jason Brian said &quot;I do know him. He's the son of Tony. Tony is dating Julie after his previous wife was staked and died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason said he would be coming over tonight&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
Just then there was a breaking news story on the TV and all of you watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have just received word that the police have raided a house that is suppose to be full of vampires&quot; the anchor said. &quot;Our roving reporter Carrie is on the scene. What can you tell us Carrie?&quot;<br />
<br />
The screen switches to show Carrie standing in front of the clan house. &quot;Well Dan there's not much to report so far&quot; Carrie said. &quot;The police had received a call early this morning about two bodies that had puncture wounds in the neck. The police turned to a self proclaimed vampire hunter to help solve these recent crimes. This vampire hunter, who only gave the police the name of Alucard as his name, told the police that he had evidence of a vampire cult in this house behind me. The police have not shared this evidence with us but it did lead to tonight's raid. The police have not caught any of the members of this vampire cult. Officially the police say that no one was here at the time of the raid though I heard a different story from a couple of officers who seemed to be frightened. They told me that there were people here when they raided the house but that they had all turned to mist and disappeared. In either case the police have been unable to make any arrests. They are now searching the house for any clues to the whereabouts of this cult and how many murders they are responsible for. This is Carrie reporting live from the scene. Back to you Dan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Carrie&quot; Dan said. &quot;The police are advising residents to stay indoors tonight or to go out in groups for safety reasons. Now onto the fire that happened last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stop listening to the news and your step-father says &quot;I guess I'll be getting a call anytime now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to go in?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid I'll have to if they call me&quot; your step-father said. &quot;Now Violet, I want you and your friends to stay here until I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Just then the door bell rang and your step-father went to answer it. When he came back he was escorting a 14 year old boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened at the house Jason?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know much&quot; Jason said, &quot;I was in my room getting ready to come over here when the announcement to mist was made. Naturally I followed the protocol and misted out my window. What I saw when I did was the police entering the house. I then reformed and changed to an owl and flew here. That's all I can tell you Head Council.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least the police didn't use any spells to prevent transformations&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
At this point a guy broke in and yelled &quot;Die vampires!&quot; He then pulled the trigger of his gun and shot Megan. Megan fell to the floor and your step-father shot the intruder.<br />
<br />
Tanya was bent over Megan's still form and crying &quot;Please Megan, don't die!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason and Sarah knelt down by Megan and Sarah said &quot;She's still alive but not for long. There's just enough time to turn her if you'll allow it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything, just save my daughter&quot; Tanya cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it Jason&quot; Sarah commanded.<br />
<br />
Sarah helped Jason take off Megan's jeans and panties. Jason then started to fuck Megan with a desperate look on his face. You just hope that Jason could finish in time to turn Megan since you could sense that she was fading fast. You weren't concerned about the intruder since you knew he was dead. Jason climaxed and then immediately lowered his head to Megan's neck and began sucking her blood. As he did you sensed Megan's slide halt and reverse. You breathed a sigh of relief that Megan would live.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Jason finished he lifted his head and said &quot;It is done Head Council.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't there a moratorium on turning people&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there is but I decided to make an exception in this case&quot; Sarah said. &quot;By the way Tanya, Megan will live. We might have to dig out the bullet when she completes the transformation though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you!&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
You go over to the intruder and take a look at the gun. It was a revolver and you have a pretty good idea what type of bullets were in it. Your step-father came over and opened the cylinder. He took out one of the bullets and examined it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know&quot; your step-father said, &quot;this looks like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A silver bullet&quot; you interrupt. &quot;He knew about silver being one of the things that kills vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Megan is dead anyway&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Megan will live&quot; you say. &quot;The only way that we can die is if we starve to death and that takes three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what does a silver bullet do to you?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as the silver is in the body, the wound caused by the silver will not close&quot; Sarah said coming over. &quot;We need to leave before people show up. We'll take Tanya and Megan with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where will we go?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each council member has a safe house that only they know about&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will it take Megan to turn?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It takes 12 hours for the transformation to be completed&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I know that I said we would be hunting tonight but with everything that's happened I have to cancel that part of tonights plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You, your step-father, and Sarah walk over to Tanya and Megan. Sarah puts Megan's panties and pants back on. She then picks her up and says &quot;We need to go now. Samantha, Lieutenant, I need you two to stay here. The rest of you need to hold on to me tight. We are going to be misting all the way to my safe house. Once there I'll take Tonya to get some things from her house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get a couple of Megan's nightshirts&quot; Tanya said. &quot;They should fit Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can bring whatever you want as long as we can carry it while you hold on to me&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must leave now&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We'll be in touch with you and I would like to warn you not to trust Alucard. I believe he has his own agenda. Now grab hold of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You each grab Sarah's arms and in a few seconds you're misting out of your parent's house and heading to Sarah's safe house.</p>
