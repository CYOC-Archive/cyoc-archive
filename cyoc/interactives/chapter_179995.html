<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Codename Vacbed. Melissa couldn&#39;t understand most of the technical details, but she managed to glean some ideas from the wordy file she had been assigned. &quot;Combat-ready energy generation and storage through polymer-based orgone production&quot;. Some kind of portable generator, perhaps? Confused, Melissa put the issue aside as the presentation wrapped up and she went off to her assignment.<br />
<br />
Melissa and a group of several other female soldiers shuffled into a waiting room. Anatomical pictures were pinned to the walls next to images of strange rectangular containers. The door opened and a woman in a lab coat emerged to greet them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Doctor Kayla Morris, and it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you all,&quot; the woman said brightly. &quot;I&#39;ll introduce you to the project we&#39;ve been developing to generate energy for both combat and civilian purposes.&quot; She shook the soldiers&#39; hands. Melissa noticed that the good doctor was wearing black latex gloves and stiletto boots beneath her lab scrubs.<br />
<br />
Dr. Morris led the group into a large laboratory. Workers in hazmat suits ferried barrels of fluid and large rectangular vessels across the lab, while technicians tapped on keyboards and inspected gauges. Nearby, a small group of handcuffed women in orange prison uniforms stood impatiently, flanked by irritated soldiers.<br />
<br />
&quot;First on our tour is the Standing Polymer Generator, or as we like to call them, &#39;rubber walls&#39;,&quot; Dr. Morris said. She gestured to one of the imposing rectangular boxes. With one of its sides open towards the touring women, Melissa could see that it was large enough to hold a person inside, but it was currently empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Power up the rubber wall!&quot; Dr. Morris barked. Technicians began fiddling with dials and switches on the side of the box, and mechanical noises filled the lab as pumps began filling the empty container. Melissa and her tour group watched entranced as thick, shiny liquid latex spurted into the vessel. Instead of spilling out of the wide-open front, however, the latex simply stopped at the boundary as if held back by a barrier, forming a flat surface. The machinery whirred to a stop as the vessel completely filled with black rubber, leaving only a perfectly smooth, shiny surface in the face of the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a marvel of modern science,&quot; Dr. Morris gushed. &quot;That polymer is still liquid, but as you can see, it&#39;s formed a smooth, stable surface in the Standing Polymer Generator.&quot; Suddenly, Melissa thought she could see a wicked grin on the doctor&#39;s face, though it passed quickly. &quot;Now let&#39;s see what happens when you disrupt it. Insert the core!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa watched as two of Dr. Morris&#39;s soldiers advanced towards the menacing black wall with a handcuffed young woman in their grasp. Clad in orange prison duds, the girl squirmed and grunted as she attempted to break free of her captors with no luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;This girl was given a choice between life in prison and these experiments,&quot; Dr. Morris said. &quot;Armed robbery, I believe. Don&#39;t worry too much about what&#39;ll happen to her.&quot; Dr. Morris seemed to be smiling a little too widely, noted Melissa.<br />
<br />
The young woman struggled as she neared the shimmering latex surface. A couple of technicians in hazmat suits turned the girl around so that she had her back to the rubber wall, facing Melissa and the tour group. She was clearly frightened. &quot;Inserting core in 3, 2, 1,&quot; a technician intoned, and they pushed the girl into the vessel.<br />
<br />
She yelped as she fell ass-first into the gleaming latex. The girl shrieked as she frantically clawed at the air, but the latex was sucking her in, coating her body in the glimmering rubber slime. The sloshing goo pulled the panicking girl upwards so that her feet no longer reached the floor. Dr. Morris grinned from ear to ear as the young woman&#39;s screams were muffled by liquid latex dripping over her face and invading her mouth. She pulled at the liquid to no effect. Quickly, her whole face was covered in the glossy black substance, along with her body.<br />
<br />
The girl uttered a muffled cry as her body was jerked backwards. Her arms and legs were forced open by the latex, showing off her exposed pussy. The young woman squirmed ineffectually as her rubber-coated body was forced into a sort of open squatting pose. &quot;Mmph! Mmmphhh!&quot; Then, a technician flipped a switch on the vessel.<br />
<br />
The shimmering latex pulsed as it began to reshape the unfortunate girl&#39;s body. &quot;Hmmphh!&quot; The girl redoubled her efforts at escaping as rubber started to infuse her from head to toe. The process was clearly pleasurable, and her muffled cries for help began to shift into moans of ecstasy. Liquid latex was absorbed into the girl, pumping up her breasts, hips, and thighs to obscene proportions. Her new skin smoothed over years of imperfections and scars, leaving the girl as perfect as a supermodel. She arched her back and shivered in pleasure as her vagina was molded into the shape of a ridged cylinder and the lips of her vulva became a swollen O. The girl craned her neck as the latex smoothed over her face, leaving it perfectly featureless save her gaping mouth. As she groaned lustfully, her mouth was reshaped into an O, her throat becoming a ribbed shaft just like her vagina. Soon, the girl was nothing more than a woman-shaped bulge in the glossy latex, with only two tight sexdoll holes where her mouth and pussy should be. Her form twitched in bliss, and a low, breathy moan could be heard from her mouth hole. The young woman was now completely converted into perfect rubber, inside and out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful!&quot; Dr. Morris exclaimed, breaking the silence. &quot;Decades of advancements in the polymeric field, all culminating to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lab-coated doctor strode over to the captive, her stilettos clicking on the tiled floor. &quot;Now that the latex has solidified around a human core, we can remove the confining vessel.&quot; She pressed a button and the walls of the rectangular container moved away, leaving behind a wall of pure latex with a moaning, squirming woman encapsulated within. Dr. Morris grabbed one of the rubberized girl&#39;s heaving breasts, eliciting a muffled gasp. The doctor suppressed a giggle.<br />
<br />
Melissa and the other touring soldiers nervously crowded around the rubber wall to get a better look. &quot;Don&#39;t be shy, ladies. Now that the polymer is inactive, you&#39;re free to touch as you wish. Don&#39;t worry about her getting free, either; conversion and assimilation into the wall is quite permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Morris held up a device shaped like a cylinder with one rounded end, vaguely resembling a white dildo. It was connected via wire to a lightbulb. &quot;This is the plug compatible with our new Standing Polymer Generator,&quot; she said, and thrust the plug into the latex girl&#39;s pussy. Immediately, the rubber wall began vibrating as the girl bucked her hips back and forth in what appeared to be an orgasm. Her moans intensified and her hardened nipples bulged lewdly from her jiggling breasts.<br />
<br />
The lightbulb plugged into the rubberized girl was glowing fiercely. &quot;There are only two outlets,&quot; Dr. Morris continued, &quot;but our new generator produces so much energy that it&#39;s trivial to split it into more.&quot; The doctor shoved another plug into the mouth hole, causing the former human to jerk violently as her pleasure doubled. &quot;The best part is that we can link them up in series for even more voltage at once. This whole building is powered with about 50 of these lovely ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once, she was a burden on society,&quot; Dr. Morris mused as she looked fondly at the twitching rubber figure. &quot;Now, she can power a city.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa felt uncomfortable and - she hated to admit it - a little aroused. She looked at her fellow soldiers and noticed that most of them were blushing or turned away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!&quot; Dr. Morris clapped her gloved hands and turned back towards the tour group. &quot;The Standing Polymer Generator is a fine device, but I&#39;m guessing that you women in uniform are more concerned with combat applications. Follow me and I&#39;ll show you the applications of our power generation technology on the battlefield.&quot;</p>
