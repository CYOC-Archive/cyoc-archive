<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon was actually quite impressed with a lot that he&#39;d seen so far on the new Animalian Colony. The official name hadn&#39;t been figured out yet, but he had heard a few guesses here and there. Some wanted the colony to take the name of the island, which would translate into Southern Volcano Island from Japanese, but Simon wasn&#39;t one hundred percent sure. There were some that had floated out the name &quot;Little Asia&quot; as it would serve as a point for Animalians who all had some connection to the Asian continent, be they uplifted zoo animals or like the Five Elements converted people from Asia. But that guess was mostly from some of the other people that had come with Animalia Ambassadoria for the official visit. He supposed that the name would likely be determined by the colony&#39;s government in due time.<br />
<br />
The thing that most impressed him was actually in the differences from some of the other places Animalia had, particularly with regard to his chosen career field. The colony had a few set up martial arts &quot;dojos&quot; that were arranged for teaching those skills from varying fields, mostly Japanese and Chinese. That by itself was impressive, but it was soon added in with their police force. Their official headquarters was in the &quot;palace&quot; where the colony&#39;s police chief could handle administrative duties and be on call for the colony government, but they also had a station that was nearby, which was what Simon and his partner from the new Animalia Ambassadoria members had covered.<br />
<br />
And that police unit was very different from Animalia and Lyre. There, most of the officers that were Animalians were either wolves or dogs, related to the fact that police units often trained dogs to aid them with law enforcement and that the highly structured nature of wolf packs made many of their behaviors perfect for law enforcement when Animalia was started. On the new island colony, however, most of the officers were actually Red Fox Animalians. Most were humans that had converted in Japan and jumped at the opportunity for &quot;promotion&quot; that came along with a new posting, though there were also a few foxes from Japan that had been uplifted after being injured in some way. The Animalia Ambassadoria interview had focused a lot on how martial arts kill and training would help, along with the human liaison that was helping organize the unit. Simon couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by that.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Buford and Aleta had also come along on the trip. There was some interest in new places and curious desires to see the new colony. There were some trepidations over the potential for &quot;shark fin soup,&quot; but so far, the people they&#39;d managed to interact with, mostly with the help of a translator that was on site had been friendly and didn&#39;t seem to want to make a meal of the two Bull Shark Animalians. They&#39;d seen some of the buildings, and they did look interesting. Buford had commented that he&#39;d never seen anything like them where he&#39;d grown up. However, after that, the two had made their way along to the beaches on the island.<br />
<br />
The island&#39;s volcanic make up made the beaches a bit different from those like Mieni in that the sand was darker and more ash-like than the sand on Mieni Atoll, but the land area that the island covered was also comparable with many of the other islands in Japan&#39;s Volcano Islands. It was apparently the largest of the islands with its geographical position that had kept it so isolated until now, and this had made for some rather nice beaches. True the dark colored sand felt different underneath their feet and the water was a bit darker here than it was at Mieni, but the slope of the beach was gradual and gentle. They&#39;d also found that the island didn&#39;t go completely into a sudden drop off from the shore. They supposed this could be good for those that were strong swimmers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think?&quot; Aleta asked to Buford as they bobbed out in the water off the north end of the beach and looking back to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think they have a good beach... good for strong swimmers to get some exercise in,&quot; Buford commented, &quot;though... while the shelf from the beach itself doesn&#39;t go into an immediate drop... it isn&#39;t exactly a long shelf. So... probably not something to be in if you&#39;re not already a strong swimmer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or can already breath water!&quot; Aleta said playfully and hopped at him in the water, dunking his head underneath it.<br />
<br />
It was a move that Buford remembered. He&#39;d had some childhood friends that he had hung out with at swimming pools or local lakes while growing up. They&#39;d have fun and there was the occasional attempt by one or more to dunk the other under the water for a few moments, which lead into some wrestling and horseplay. It might not have truly been &quot;safe&quot; as it could be a way to drown someone, if one was serious, but back then, no one had been serious and for him and Aleta now, that didn&#39;t apply. Buford opened his mouth and let the salt water in and flow over his gills as a valve in the back of his mouth actually closed to block the water from going to his lungs. Filtering oxygen out from the water throw his gills, the male Bull Shark Animalian could soon see the female joining him underwater in her green swimsuit.<br />
<br />
The two smiled and almost danced for a few moments underwater before deciding to make their way back toward the shore, mostly for the sake of continuing to look around the island. They eventually emerged and let the water drain out of their gills before switching over to their lungs and looking down the beach to the east. In that direction they found an area where the beach ended and there was a modest harbor where a set of what looked like fishing boats being tied up to it. There was also a modest sized building just inside the shore. There was some of the nervousness as they approached, as the building was said to be a fish processing plant, likely to feed the predator Animalians that might come to live on the new colony, or at least visit, as well as to feed the tourist industry. But so far their had been the assurance that that would only have to do with catching fish that weren&#39;t uplifted.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The southern part of the island was where the raised part of the volcano was. It had long cooled to the point where scientists found that the volcano was not only inactive but there was no threat of an eruption. In this one of the first things that had been put together was a large viewing platform that allowed guests and visitors to look out in all directions. It was an impressive wooden platform that was well stained and sanded that sat atop the mountain that allowed people to look out safely. There were also plaques that then pointed out major points on the global map and how far away they were. Along one of the south guard rails was a plaque for &quot;the Marianas Islands&quot; that was written in Chinese, Japanese, and in English with the distance listed in both English and Metric units. On a dead north rail there was a plaque for the Japanese Home Islands, toward the northeast corner there was one for Iwo Jima, and on the western guard rail there was one for Okinawa and another for the Chinese mainland.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is interesting how open things are here,&quot; came the voice from one of the two guests presently on the platform. The voice was feminine and came from the female Bald Eagle Animalian, who&#39;d converted to be with Eugene after meeting him, Melanie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Eugene commented as he looked out over the open horizon with some cases of being able to even see waves and rolls in the ocean, even going out a fair distance out to sea.<br />
<br />
Eugene had originally joined Project Phoenix to gain the ability to see, and while there were some times where an eagle&#39;s vision wasn&#39;t quite as great as one would think, it was offset by the ability to fly and the joy of simply being able to see. And at present, the distances were such that an eagle&#39;s eyes were needed to see at a distance helped. As a Bald Eagle Animalian, Eugene even had some advantage that allowed him to look out at the water without the issue of glare. And he&#39;d found that when flying over the stream that ran into and out of Lyre/Animalia, he could see into it, no matter how far up he was and see things in excellent detail. That didn&#39;t help him too much looking at the ocean, but there were some points that made that still an interesting thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... we&#39;re not too far away from many of the spots they have listed, though the closest is Iwo,&quot; Melanie commented, &quot;but even that is beyond visual range... even for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it shows just how big the world is,&quot; Eugene commented as he looked over to his bond mate, &quot;that there can be spaces that can be open and still have areas open beyond our expectations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it is,&quot; came a new voice making both Eugene and Melanie turn to one of the hotel&#39;s translators with another eagle Animalian with him.<br />
<br />
The Animalian was actually slightly taller than Eugene and was far more heavily built. His bill was large and a bright gold, the only real difference between it and the two Bald Eagles was that his bill was bigger. It also shared the brown and white coloration that the Bald Eagle was known for with some obvious exceptions. Unlike Eugene and Melanie, his head largely had brown feathers with only small speckling of white feathers above his bill. He had brown feathers that went down his neck and disappeared under a gray folded vest that had no sleeves. In this, Eugene and Melanie could see a band of white feathers along the top of his shoulders and along the leading edge of his wings. The rest of his arms and wings were covered in brown feathers. Only gold skinned and talon tipped hands poked out from brown feathers that covered his arms. He also wore a pair of black shorts that covered the white feathers at his waist, but they continued down to his feat and the white tail feathers  that swayed behind him. Both Melanie and Eugene noted that this Steller&#39;s Sea Eagle Animalian looked rather curious about them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Melanie gave a small wave  and looked to the translator, &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Eugene, Ms. Melanie,&quot; the translator said with a bow, &quot;this is... well, his name in Japanese mean&#39;s Steller, after the name for his species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you, Steller,&quot; Eugene spoke as he and Melanie bowed and Steller bowed back, &quot;Is there something we can do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stellar listened as the hotel translator translated what Eugene had said into Japanese. He then answered in Japanese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to speak with fellow eagles again,&quot; Steller answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again?&quot; Melanie wondered, tilting her head to her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose this relates to how I was uplifted,&quot; Steller answered once he got the translation, &quot;I was originally a young eagle and had been growing up with my family around Hokkaido to the Russian far east. We had been following some of the salmon in the ocean in that area and came across one of Japan&#39;s fishing boats in the region. They had some fish laying out on the deck and we were hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you raided the fishing ships?&quot; Melanie asked as the translator repeated what Steller said in Japanese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the most honorable... I suppose...&quot; Steller admitted, &quot;but became worse for me in that when the crew tried to chase us off... I made a mistake and got caught in a winch that was pulling the nets in. I ended up losing a wing as a result. The fishermen saved my life and got me to a zoo... but I&#39;d lost a wing and it turned that the eagles at the zoo were not particularly happy to have me around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were uplifted through Project Phoenix!&quot; Eugene said with wide eyes as he realized what Steller was getting at.<br />
<br />
Steller nodded after he got the translation, &quot;Yes. Horizon&#39;s Tokyo office learned of my condition and presented the option that if uplifted... I would be able to fly again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in Project Phoenix too,&quot; Eugene smiled, &quot;to allow me to see and I have nothing to truly complain about with regard to being a Bald Eagle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steller smiled back as he got the latest translation. It seemed that both he and Eugene had joined Animalia to heal some injury or deficiency. Steller was also happy to be able to talk with fellow eagles again.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what&#39;s brought you down here?&quot; Melanie wondered, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t we be a bit too far south for the Steller&#39;s Sea Eagle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... but the colony was supposed to have its own fishing fleet too,&quot; Steller answered after the question was translated, &quot;So... I jumped at the chance to join. Feed other Animalians and put my eyesight to good use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie and Eugene both nodded at that and then looked out toward the ocean to the south, as it was one of the sights that they had come to see. The great dark blue expanse that surrounded the green volcanic island. In the process, Steller soon joined them and they continued to share thoughts and feelings, each learning more about the other.</p>
