<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as you were pretty sure you&#39;ve gone insane that you made sure of your listing. first, You&#39;ve been lead to a deserted temple by a leopard with human intelligence and second, you&#39;re being talked to by the king of this temple. You might as well be saying hello to the psych ward right now. &quot;um... if you don&#39;t mind....&quot; you say to the king, &quot;but Could you maybe show the rest of yourself from the throne over there so I can confirm that I&#39;m not going insane?&quot;<br />
<br />
the king was silent for a moment, but then said to you, &quot;Very well, young one. If it helps you.&quot; the king slowly got off of his throne chair as he walks over to the moon light that were coming in from the cracks in the ceiling and walls. not taking you see off of him till he stopped in the light of the moon that made you want to scream.<br />
<br />
the king was standing in the moon light as you saw a man wearing a red dress with flat boots on. he looked almost completely normal if he didn&#39;t have a head of a leopard instead of a normal head. as he smiles the best he can with his muzzle and says to you while staring at you with his yellow eyes, &quot;Is this what you wanted, young one?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sight of a man with a leopard&#39;s head was enough to break you. Something in you snaps you back out of your mind as you scream, much to the kings dismay. Turning, you ran out of the throne room while heading back into the hall that leads to the doors out. the king yelled out something in a long-dead language as he was shocked. as you were running that You hear a roar behind you and turn, just in time to see the leopard that lead you here to the temple bounding out of the throne room to the door and towards you. taking huge strides with it&#39;s thick tail that the leopard was whipping it behind itself.<br />
<br />
tripping on a few protruding stones and roots that it almost made you go down hard on to your stomach. the dumbest move you made was when you turn around as the leopard was sill after you that you flinched when you should of scurried while you looked just in time to see the leopard springing into the air towards you, growling, fangs bared, huge paws stretched out towards you. as You throw your arms over yourself for defense while  preparing for death to find out later that it went right through you like nothing came.<br />
<br />
You move your arms down and, much to your surprise, the leopard is gone. You quickly look around while wondering if it has hiding, but there is no place for it to hide here. Suddenly, a sharp pain in your gut causes you to double over in pain as You feel a pressure rising in your throat and traveling upwards. You try to hold it in, but it escapes out of your mouth in the form of a loud feline-like roar. while you were roaring, your nose becomes triangular as your nose and mouth pushes out into a muzzle complete with fur and whiskers. A lump rises in your throat as you again try to scream, but all that comes out is another roar. You slowly bring your hands up to your new muzzle to feel it as you yowling in terror, but you notice that your hands were bulging up into huge, furry four-toed paws with wicked sharp claws on the end.<br />
<br />
You suddenly felt warm as a thick coat of fur grows all over you as You feel your butt, your thighs, your stomach, even your neck swell out with muscle that the fur washes over them. A long, thick, tail comes out of your rear while you felt your toes merging into paws as they extend as well. The terror of the transformation was too much for you that you fell into your unconsciousness...<br />
<br />
after what took like for hours only took about fifteen minutes later that you woke up, but feeling a bit Groggy. wondering what happened to you that you lift yourself up and looked over your body. You were almost ready to scram in shock that What you saw was the massive body of a jungle leopard. as You try to scream, but your new muzzle doesn&#39;t seem to want to respond to your shocked cries as they come out as roars. you quickly got on your paws and padded your way towards the throne room while having troubles over your new body controls. You try and do your best to resist from falling over onto the ground as as you tumbled over from fall to fall, but Suddenly you get the hang of your new body controls as you seem to move everything willingly.<br />
<br />
it was weird, yet freaky as you were walking on all four that everything around you seemed much larger and taller than you remembered. Before you entered into the throne room, you find a nearby pool of water and decided to looking into it as you made your way there. as you looked into the waters reflection that a nice looking leopard was staring back at you with no indication of you ever being human. You open up your muzzle and examine your new sharp fangs as you were running your thickened, rough tongue over them that you closed your muzzle up and headed over into the throne room.<br />
<br />
the king was now sitting in his throne chair as the leopard that brought you here was sitting in front of the king. he had his fingers together as he looked very angry. you begin to  sit down on your haunches about five feet away from him and next to the leopard as you involuntary bowed. You then get back up and stare at him. &quot;what you just done was a big mistake. I was going to tell you all of my requests that i needed you to do, but no,  you just had to run away in fright. So I had my leopard friend here and turn you into a nice leopard.<br />
<br />
you tried to stay calm as you were terrified as a part of you wanted to scream and yell at the king to turn you back, but that wouldn&#39;t help any as you could only growl and roar. then king then rows from his set as he then dismisses the other leopard. suddenly there were just the two of you as the king speaks to as he says...</p>
