<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish you&#39;d been raised by someone that taught you how to be nice to others!&quot; Bill roared, and the upper hallway of the Strasserman residence was immediately filled with a heavy green bank of fog that poured forth from BIll&#39;s clenched fist. His vision fell away to nothing but a wall of pale green as the clouds engulfed everything before suddenly receding back within the gemstone. Blinking the last vestiges of smoke from his eyes, he saw that the only two people in the hallway were now himself and Tammy, who was rubbing and blinking her own eyes, clearing the remnants of the magic from her vision.<br />
<br />
And Gloria was nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
Bill couldn&#39;t help but crack a hateful grin at the empty spot on the carpet that Gloria had inhabited just moments ago before relaxing his fist and sliding the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone out to rest between his thumb and index finger, a thin tendril of green smoke trailing of of the large crack in it&#39;s surface that Bill had yet to notice. Had Bill had noticed the damage to the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone, Bill might have realized that his wish to create a nice version of Gloria had gone horribly, utterly wrong. Instead of making it so that Gloria had been born to a family that would raise her not to be so controlling, manipulative, selfish and uncaring of others, instead the damaged Stone had done the complete opposite. In it&#39;s damaged state it had reached out and detected the two meanest individuals in the area, changing them to be suitable as parents of the former Gloria Vanapolous. But Bill knew none of this, and he began to revel in his victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, you do something right for a change!&quot; Bill said triumphantly, giving Tammy a huge grin as though he&#39;d just done something amazingly heroic. For so long Tom had suffered, and by extension, Bill had suffered under Gloria&#39;s tyrannical yoke, and with the final straw of changing Bill&#39;s entire family around, wiping his little sister from existence and putting his and Tammy&#39;s daughter in the role as his older sister was just too much to bear anymore. He had done it, Bill had finally removed the problem from their lives! Now he could (maybe) wish Tom back to normal and they could go on enjoying their lives as it should have been, not what Gloria had turned it into.<br />
<br />
But as his eyes focused on Tammy, he saw that the disgraced basketball star turned adorable geek girl next door had undergone changes herself, and not for the better. His grin faded immediately.<br />
<br />
Gone was the slight layer of fat that had given Tammy her adorable softness, now the teenage boy turned girl was clearly overweight as her waistline had ballooned outward, her face now chunky and splotched by acne marks, rounded off by a double chin while a pair of tired eyes stared out from behind a pair of glasses. Her hair was now a mess, a mousy, dull nest of blonde hair that looked like it hadn&#39;t been properly cared for in a long time, and even Tammy&#39;s imported fashion sense, geek-chic had been replaced by a pair of oversized jeans topped by a featureless gray sweatshirt, both of which did little to hide Tammy&#39;s newly oversized body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill, what did you do?&quot; Tammy asked weakly as she stared down at herself in horror.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, elsewhere...<br />
<br />
Things had happened so fast for Gloria. One moment she had been confused as to why Bill had seemed so upset, and then the next moment he had hit her and taken the gemstone! Then Strasserman had screamed his wish and then everything had gone...green? She felt herself moving, her body changing and shifting before suddenly the world popped back into focus, and Gloria found herself laying on a bed that smelled strongly of cheap beer and cigarettes, stinging her sensitive noise as her body suddenly felt weighed down, her stomach churning as her head began to throb painfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh god...&quot; Gloria moaned, and pulled herself upright, untangling herself from the sheets of the bed and stumbling across thin carpet, alien glass bottles clattering as the teenager struggled to maintain her balance while the contents of her stomach began a quick and violent climb upwards towards her mouth. She reached for the dim outline of a door and jerked it open without stopping, Gloria stumbled out of the very small room and crashed into the opposite wall of a very narrow hallway. Somehow, she instinctively knew where to go, barefoot thundering a few steps down the short hallway and into the darkened opening she somehow knew was a particularly filthy bathroom. Her hands flew out into the shadows and bounced painfully off the hard plastic of a light switch, her fingers stinging as she reached out again and flipped the switch upwards, filling the bathroom with weak, yellow light. Had Gloria had the time to take in her surrounding and not make an immediate beeline for the toilet, she would have seen that it was filthy, stains on the walls and tile, an overflowing garbage basket and a tub that more than a few beer cans in it. But Gloria simply dashed for the porcelain throne, knelt in front of it, and vomited up the contents of her stomach.<br />
<br />
Acid and bile surged through Gloria&#39;s body while salty tears stung her eyes, her hair dangling dangerously close to the foul water of the toilet bowel. Gloria&#39;s body heaved and retched for several minutes as it purged itself of the excess booze and stomach acids before finally she pulled back as the last of the bile spilled from her mouth in a long tendril of drool. She spit the last of the terrible contents out of her mouth and collapsed backwards against a wall that seemed far too thin as the world swirled around her. Gloria closed her eyes and shifted into a slightly more comfortable position for a few moments before finding the energy in her drained body to pull herself upwards, a hand that lacked her manicured nails grasping the small counter that held the bathroom&#39;s small sink, and above it, the lone medicine cabinet. The only one in the house.<br />
<br />
&#39;How do I know all this? &#39;Why do I feel so weird?&#39; Gloria thought to herself as she slowly pulled herself up, her free hand pushing the toilet&#39;s handle downward and sending the stinking mess from her insides down into the septic tank, her entire body feeling strange beyond the massive hangover that she was clearly suffering from. Her questions were answered as she finally stood and looked at herself in the mirror, her changed eyes going wide in terror.<br />
<br />
On top of being almost a foot taller, Gloria&#39;s entire body had been changed.<br />
<br />
Gone were her Mediterranean looks, the large nose, the silky black hair that once hung down her back replaced with short strawberry blonde curls that barely went past her ears, her eyes now a strange blue-green crowned by thick eyebrows that had more than a few piercings. A light smattering of freckles across her plain cheeks and thin, pursed lips that replaced her previously full ones completed a face that could have, with enough work and make-up, been attractive. Now she was rather plain, with vague Nordic features that seemed to be cancelled out by the other half of her new genetic code. Even below her neck, Gloria&#39;s good looks had been re-arranged, her breasts were different and larger than they had been before, hanging freely beneath a ratty gray t-shirt that had more than a few stains on it. Gloria&#39;s arms were larger than she remembered them being, toned and muscled, and covered in tattoos that led to two large hands that seemed to be almost twice the size of their original form. Her hips were more or less gone, simply small curves on the road to her legs which, despite feeling like they were made of concrete at the moment, were clearly just as toned and muscled as her arms were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot; Gloria screamed, throwing herself away from the counter and slamming once more into a wall that felt perilously thin. &quot;What did Bill do to me!?&quot; She screamed, as she stared at her new body in horror. Even her voice was different! Gone was her cute soprano, her voice now deeper, huskier.<br />
<br />
But further inspection was impossible as a great rumbling came from the next room over. A bed creaked loudly and the sound of two feet thundering closer through the clattering of bottles and cans before the door next to the bathroom tore open and an ominous, very angry shape appeared in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did I tell you about making noise!?&quot; The very female voice hissed in anger, and it took a moment for the identity of the older, topless woman in front of her to register. Knowledge, unbidden, began to pour into her mind, reinforcing the familiarity of her surroundings as suddenly she became aware that beyond her physical appearance, she wasn&#39;t Gloria Vanapolous anymore. There was something else in her, something that was born of the small, falling apart trailer she now knew was her home, had been her home her entire life. Anger, resentment, hate, survival instincts against not just the woman in front of her, someone she knew she was stronger than but still felt an intense fear towards, but the rest of the world for how she had been raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck!&quot; Gloria barked, the expletive feeling...familiar yet alien to her, &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry...mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You damn well better be!&quot; Hissed...</p>
