<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">t was well after mid-day by the time the rays of sun filtered through Jamie&#39;s westward facing window, and woke her up. She had been sound asleep all day; a slumber fueled, no doubt, by the curse readying her body for her impending transformation. Jamie yawned deeply as she stretched her womanly figure. She was a little shocked to be able to smell something cooking in the kitchen. &#39;My bedroom is on the opposite side of the house and up one story, how is that even possible?&#39; Jamie thought as she remembered the events of the previous day. &#39;Oh yeah... I was bitten last night.&#39; The solemn thought brought fear back to the forefront of her mind and she quickly ran to the mirror to see if her nose had changed already.<br />
<br />
Jamie stared in the mirror. Nope, still the same old nose she&#39;d always had. Her eye&#39;s looked sharper though, and were her canines always that long? Loud clicks resonated around the room as she placed her hands on the sink. Her nails had grown too; now, almost an inch long, they tapered into points at the end. &#39;Just short enough for the others not to get suspicious.&#39; She thought. &#39;At least I won&#39;t have to worry about that just yet. I&#39;m also starving.&#39; Jamie quickly changed clothes, but as she stripped down she noticed something else. Her moderate bust had grown substantially, and her thin physique had put on a considerable amount of muscle. Her old A-cups were almost Ds now, and, although she wasn&#39;t veiny or brutish, she did look quite strong. She dropped her jaw when she noticed the changes, reaching both hands up to cup her enlarged mammaries. &quot;Maybe I can get used to this curse after all.&quot; She said to herself. &quot;Mamma looks good.&quot; She smiled, sqeezing her tits and offered a toothy grin to herself in the mirror. A soft growl escaped from her throat as she smiled, and Jamie had a feeling she was going to be just fine as a werewolf. Jamie finished getting dressed. She felt goood, and she wanted to look good too. Before long she found some clothes in her closet that did a good job of accentuating her new assets. She guessed the others probably wouldn&#39;t notice a difference from before. They weren&#39;t blind or anything, but she had been wearing loose bagging clothing, like sweat shirts, up until now so how would they know whether she had such a curvy figure or not. Finally done getting dressed and taking in her subtle wolf-like qualities, she headed down to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Henry was cooking up steaks for everyone and the others: Sara, Aaron, and Kelly were talking about what could have happened to Nate. Jamie sat down at the table and took a deep whiff of the cooking meat. &quot;How would you like yours?&quot; Henry asked the late arrival.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rare,&quot; Jamie quipped shortly, then added. &quot;Please, very rare. I don&#39;t want to ruin the flavor.&quot; Rare?! What was she thinking? She&#39;d never eaten a steak that wasn&#39;t at least medium well done. &#39;It must be the my new wolf side.&#39; Jamie thought to herself, being sure to hide any shock she might have wanted to show on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think they got him.&quot; Sara&#39;s voice could be heared over the sizzling sound of beef on the skillet. &quot;I mean we heard howling in his room and when we went up there he was gone and his window was open. Put two and two together!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I know that, but we can&#39;t just leave him. What if he needs our help out there?&quot; Kelly replied  bashfully. &quot;What do you think Jamie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie paused for a moment. She knew what had happened to Nate. They had got him. He was a werewolf now. A magnificent one at that, with his luxurious fur and bulging biceps, and she wouldn&#39;t be far behind him. &#39;In fact,&#39; She thought to herself. &#39;Maybe he&#39;d like to be behind me, thrusting hard as he holds me tight...&#39; She shook her head trying to clear that thought from her mind. &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t know, he could still be out there.&quot; Jamie lied through her sharp teeth. &quot;I mean we didn&#39;t see anything yesterday besides those creepy eyes, right? How do we know there are even werewolves out there?&quot; Jamie felt terrible lying to them, but what was she supposed to do? Tell them the truth? &#39;Hi, yeah um werewolves are definitely real and they turned Nate; so yeah, he&#39;s not coming back. Oh, also he bit me so I&#39;m going to turn into a werewolf soon too. Oh yeah and on top of that, I can&#39;t stop thinking about how much I want Nate to fuck me! Doggy style, just like the animal I am!&#39; Jamie&#39;s head nearly exploded from the train of thought runnig through her head, but she managed to keep her inner dialogue silenced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! See, that&#39;s dumb.&quot; Aaron piped up from his seat. &quot;Man, Nate&#39;s dead to us guys, and we need to just accept that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before anyone could carry the conversation any further Henry called everyone in for their steaks. Jamie was surprised at just how &quot;rare&quot; Henry had left her steak. The outside was seared nicely but when she cut into it blood poured out onto her plate. Drool fell out of her mouth in response to the smell of the delicious meal. The savory aroma  wafted up into her sensitive nose, and It was all Jamie could do not rip into it with her bare hands. Barely maintaining self control she dug in with a knife and fork. The first bite was ecstasy in her mouth; she had never tasted something so good. Blood clung to her tongue as she looked across the dining table at the other contestants. They had no idea what was out there. No idea what they were missing out on. Jamie exchanged glances with Henry as she surveyed the other contestants. For a moment she thought she picked up a signal. A slight nod, almost like he knew her secret. She tried sniffing harder, maybe he had been bitten too; but all she could smell was everyone&#39;s steaks. She&#39;d have to keep her eye out for him, perhaps she had an ally on the inside.</p>
