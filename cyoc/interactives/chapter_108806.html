<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was nearing noon when Sheriff Cooper finally had a moment to look at his emails. Scrolling through them he comes across one from Frieda Knight.<br />
“Now what are you emailing little girl; Sheriff Cooper opening the file up. The first message he sees is in all Caps reading:<br />
<br />
‘NICE TRY WITH THE FAKE E-MAILS, BUT WE&#39;RE ON TO YOU!’<br />
<br />
”That makes no sense,” Sheriff Cooper scratching his head; reading below he sees why Frieda copied him; yet he is still looking confused.<br />
<br />
‘Dear Frieda,<br />
I have been thinking of you none stop since the last we spent time together under the starry night sky at you induction ceremony. I never had a chance to thank your father for arraigning our moment of passion; I know we never had a chance to get together after, what with my family’s business ventures and me travelling. But I’m here in Moon Lake and I was hoping we could get together. If I remember you certainly did enjoy my tender touch and gentle caresses. I look forward from hearing from you.<br />
<br />
With warmest regards,<br />
Bryan’<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Benton was in his study; relaxing after he got confirmation from Franklin catering that his staff will be at his estate promptly by four. Feeling content his phone rings and he sees its Sheriff Cooper. Answering it Benton listens as the sheriff tells about a curious email he received from Frieda.<br />
“Ah yes,” Benton answering; “I’m aware of that email. My daughter showed it to me before she got out of the car and met her friends at school.”<br />
“Do you mind telling me what this is about,” the sheriff asking; “I’m at a loss as to what to make of it.”<br />
“It’s Julie Stovall trying to mess with my daughter,” Benton calmly responding; “That is what Frieda told me. Apparently Frieda gave Julie some fictional account of her induction ceremony just to shut the girl up. From what Frieda told me, their friendship was already getting strained and this was months before the whole incident with Julie last Tuesday.”<br />
“Great another email attack,” Sheriff Cooper moans. Benton can hear on his end the sheriff’s trademark popping of Aspirin; “and here I thought my day couldn’t get any worse.”<br />
“Can you do me a favor sheriff,” Benton asking; “please talk to my daughter about this tomorrow. She has a very important engagement after school and I would like for her to be cleared headed for it. She is inducting two new member into the were-panther pride tonight,” Benton sighs; “its Julie’s friends, Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson.”<br />
<br />
The sheriff is silent for the moment. “I can’t guarantee that Benton,“ Sheriff Cooper answering; “I can get a warrant to search the Stovall house. Only this warrant would be limited in scope. Focusing on Julie’s computer only.”<br />
“Okay,” Benton answering; “then get the warrant, seize her computer and have it examined by your tech experts. It will not only scare the little fish but stop any future attempts to engage what could be described as witness intimidation/tampering.”<br />
“I will still need to talk to your daughter Benton,” Sheriff Cooper responds; “if not today, then first thing tomorrow morning.”<br />
“As long as I’m present,” Benton states; “just call me before you want to talk to Frieda.” Benton hangs up and goes back to his tasks.<br />
<br />
The Sheriff after talking with Benton looks at the email from Frieda for a second time. Sighing he gets up to once again head to the Stovall residence.<br />
 <br />
*****<br />
<br />
It was around lunch time when both Martin and Julie stopped for lunch when the doorbell rings. Martin opening the door to see the Sheriff with two deputies present, groans.<br />
 “What did Julie do this time,” Martin knowing full well this was not a social visit.<br />
“I have a warrant to seize your daughter’s computer,” Sheriff Cooper answers; “these deputies are here to assist in the task.”<br />
“Seize Julie’s computer,” Martin reading the warrant; “under what pretense?”<br />
“Frieda Knight copied me on and Email she swears came from your daughter,” Sheriff Cooper answers; “may I remind you that Julie is charged with assaulting Frieda and Eric Anderson. If Julie is the author of this email, your daughter could be facing additional charges.”<br />
“JULIE STOVALL,” Martin shouting; “what did you do this time?”<br />
<br />
Julie who heard the exchange between her father and the sheriff, just silently swore. She was in trouble; thanks to her father, she was unable to delete any of the emails she did this morning and the replies. What’s worse, the police will find them and corroborate Frieda’s accusations. Before she could react; her father mad as hell as he stormed into the kitchen after shouting; the sheriff following while the deputies headed towards Julie’s room to collect her computer.<br />
“Answer me daughter,” Martin clearly livid; “What. Did. You. Do!”<br />
“Nothing illegal,” Julie doing her best to be defiant; “I’m sure my lawyer will attest to that.”<br />
“That is for us and the prosecutor to decide,” The sheriff glaring at the little girl; “last chance to fess up, Julie. Because once the deputies come back down with your computer, that’s it; It’s out of my paws. I will be bound by law to take the appropriate action that the courts deem necessary.”<br />
“Sheriff,” Martin fuming; “just take the computer and leave. Melissa and myself will deal with our daughter.”<br />
“And how are you going to further punish me,” Julie still acting defiant; “you destroyed the sim card for my phone, took away t.v. and now no computer thanks to the sheriff and Frieda’s big mouth.” Looking at her father and sneering; “what more can you do to me?”<br />
“I’ll think of something,” Martin seethes as the deputies come back down with Julie’s computer; “wait until your mother hears of this.” Martin just glares at his daughter; “go to your room. NOW!”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper who witnessed the exchange, sighs; “I’m sorry for having to do this.”<br />
“Yeah, yeah I know,” Martin grumbles; “it’s your job. Just go Douglas; I have work to do and some decisions to make.” Martin escorting the sheriff to the front door; “Sheriff you may not know this, but Andrew Curry is stepping down from the Elder council. He is naming me his replacement.”<br />
“You’re going to be the next wer-mer rep;” Sheriff Cooper looking surprised.<br />
“After what Julie just did,” Martin sighs; “I have to. Julie doesn’t know it, but Benton Knight is going to go after her hard. As a member of the elder council it might give me some clout to get him to back off.”<br />
“Be that as it may Martin,” Sheriff Copper responding; “I doubt Julie cares. My suggestion; if she somehow manages to skate by on these legal issues, ship her off to some military reform school. Get her as far away from Moon Lake as you can.”<br />
“I’ll talk to Melissa about that when she gets home,” Martin responding; “right now I have a phone call to make.” Martin closes the door and heads to his home office and calls up Andrew Curry.<br />
“Andrew its Martin; I’ll do it. I’ll be your replacement for the elder council.”<br />
“That’s great,” Andrew responds; “but why give me an answer so soon?”<br />
“Because of what Julie just did,” Martin answering; “its best I tell you in person. Can you come by in a few hours? Melissa will be home and I would like for the both of you to hear what I have to say.”<br />
“Alright,” Andrew answering; “I can be there for four.”<br />
“That’ll work,” Martin nodding; “talk to you then.” Martin hangs up and ponders what he is going to do to Julie.</p>
