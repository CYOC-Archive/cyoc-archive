<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So Mark spent the night in Anna&#39;s body in Anna&#39;s bed. Anna spent the night in Jennifer&#39;s body in Christine&#39;s bed. Both had trouble getting to sleep and both considered slipping into the other&#39;s room. However fear of being discovered in bed together by Anna&#39;s family meant neither acted on their longings. <br />
<br />
After a lot of time pondering what had happened and exploring their bodies both eventually fell asleep. Mark had to admit that Anna&#39;s bed was very comfortable. <br />
<br />
Mark was woken by Mrs K, sometime early in the morning. &#39;Girls. Time to get up. It&#39;s after 6 and we have to have you at the bus by 7.30&#39;<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Mark to remember where he was and why he was dressed in Anna&#39;s nightie. He/she quickly got out of bed with an urgent need to void her bladder. Luckily she knew where the bathroom was as she got there just in time. However trying to pee standing up when you have a girls body is asking for disaster. Mark felt liquid trickling down her legs before remembering that girls need to sit.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed Mark was cleaning up the mess she had made when the real Anna in Jennifer&#39;s body was urgently knocking on the toilet door.<br />
<br />
&#39;What are you doing in there? Hurry up I need to go as well&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I won&#39;t be a minute. I just had a little accident&#39; She quietly replied. Mark was amazed that Anna&#39;s sweet tones came from her mouth.<br />
<br />
That caused Anna to open the door and barge in &#39;Oh that&#39;s disgusting!&#39; She said when she saw the mess on the floor. &#39;How did you manage that?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I forgot what body I was in and tried to pee standing up&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Really? There&#39;s no taking you anywhere Anna&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not Anna. Don&#39;t call me that&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Derr.... Have a look in the mirror. You&#39;re Anna. Anyway get out. I need to go in a hurry. I&#39;ll clean up the mess. You get in the shower and I&#39;ll lay out some clothes for you to wear on the bus. Wash my hair, and remember to use conditioner. The shower facilities at camp aren&#39;t great&#39;<br />
<br />
Mark felt like he could have stayed in the shower all day. It was amazing being naked in Anna&#39;s body. The way the water funnelled between the breasts was a real turn on. He did wash Anna&#39;s hair. It needed a lot more shampoo than he was used to to lather up Anna&#39;s long brown locks. Mark did remember to use conditioner.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hurry up Anna&#39; called out the real Anna. &#39;I need a shower as well&#39;  Marked had completed washing so had no choice but to turn off the water and step out. <br />
<br />
Anna in Jennifer&#39;s body was in the bathroom. She passed Mark a fluffy towel. &#39;Quick get dried. Clothes to wear are on your bed. Get dressed and I&#39;ll help you with hair and make-up once I&#39;m ready myself&#39; After saying that she pulled off the nightie she had been wearing and she gave the naked female Mark a kiss on the lips. &#39;Just a teaser. No time for anything now. You will have to wait until tonight girl&#39; Anna turned and got into the shower herself and soon had the water running.<br />
<br />
Mark dried as best she could then wrapped the towel around her waist to make the dash back to Anna&#39;s bedroom. Realising she needed to hide more than just her groin she adjusted the towel to cover her boobs as well just as he had seen his own sister do. Just as well as when she fled the bathroom she found Anna&#39;s dad in the hall.<br />
<br />
&#39;Anna&#39; you need to hurry. We&#39;ll need top leave in 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes Dad&#39; Mark managed to reply as she dashed to Anna&#39;s room. Mr K must have got a good glimpse of her bare bum as Mark realised the towel wasn&#39;t wrapped very well. He quickly shut the door to the room.<br />
<br />
On the bed she found the outfit Anna wanted her to wear neatly laid out on the bed. Trust Anna. He had been expecting to wear jeans and a shirt but no Anna had laid out a blue dress with yellow flowers on it, along with a light blue lacy satin bra and matching panties.<br />
<br />
Knowing she needed to hurry Mark didn&#39;t hesitate to put the underwear on. Of course they fit perfectly. The bra enhanched her cleavage.<br />
<br />
Mark didn&#39;t want to wear the dress and began searching Anna&#39;s wardrobes for a pair of jeans. He knew Anna had pairs of jeans but couldn&#39;t find them. The only trouser like items he found looked like Arabian pantaloons. In fact all of Anna&#39;s jeans and shorts were in her suitcases which he and Anna had parked near the front door before going to bed last night. No doubt even now Mr K was stacking them in the car.<br />
<br />
He was interrupted by an already dressed Anna (in Jennifer&#39;s body) coming through the door. She felt herself screech in embarrassment to still just be in the silky bras and panties. &#39;What are you doing?&#39; asked the pretend Jennifer. <br />
<br />
&#39;Looking for something less girly to wear&#39; Mark replied.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Mum bought that dress for me to wear on the first day of camp. It&#39;s most important to make a good first impression. Beside&#39;s Mum will be very disappointed if you don&#39;t wear it&#39;<br />
<br />
So Mark soon found herself wearing the blue dress, along with some yellow heeled sandals. Anna then spent 10 minutes drying and styling Mark&#39;s hair before making him wear some bangles and earrings and even Anna&#39;s Ray bans sunglasses. At least if he bumped into someone he knew he would not be recognized.<br />
<br />
Anna herself wasn&#39;t anywhere near as dressed up as Mark. Somehow it was okay for her to just be wearing jeans and a polo shirt. However Mark didn&#39;t have time to argue. Mr K was already in the car waiting for them.</p>
