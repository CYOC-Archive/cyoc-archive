<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Beginning phase two,” echoed through the room.<br />
<br />
“Ohh, yes!” Charlie moaned expectantly.  Now that he had gotten a taste of what the machine could provide, he craved even more of it.  He wouldn&#39;t let a second of his growth go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
At first, he tried holding his breath so that he could see precisely how his chest was growing.  This quickly became impossible as his shirt chafed his nipples, again wracking his body with pleasure.  He took several deep breaths.  After a few breaths, his body was in the oversized, cramped configuration it had been in moments earlier.  Charlie knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before his clothing burst open.<br />
<br />
Charlie tentatively raised his arm to flex his bicep, and he felt stitches popping under his armpit.  Figuring this was his chance, he quickly went into a double biceps pose, instantly ripping both sleeves.  His pits seemed to be contained for the moment. “Aww yeah, did you see that? I fucking burst out of my shirt.” he gloated, as if to no one in particular.  Charlie noticed just how hairy his arms had become.  Tufts of shoulder hair were kept mostly in check by the remnants of his sleeves, but he could tell he had a lot more hair than usual.<br />
<br />
“Well, your sleeves,” interjected Lee, distracting Charlie from that thought.  Charlie, feeling the adrenaline running through him, tried to hulk out of his shirt like he had seen in the movies.  His back was so thick that the stitches at his armpits could no longer contain him, but the shirt remained mostly on him.  Charlie tried again, and the rips widened.  Finally, after taking a deep breath (and a bit more largesse from the machine), he pulled a most muscular once more, and his shirt gave up, leaving his torso exposed.<br />
<br />
Charlie saw Lee gawking at him, but he didn&#39;t care.  He himself was caught up looking at his new size.  His chest -- far bigger than he imagined it ever could be -- appeared all the larger due to the pelt of fur he now had growing on it.  Charlie had always been reasonably hairy for a guy his age, and had been happy with that.  But the kick that this machine was giving him seemed to be launching his hormones into overdrive, and he found that he liked it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t have a good view of his abs, but he could tell that they had made some serious improvements.  He pulled his arms behind his head to flex his abs and quads, when suddenly he felt a great relief in his lower body.<br />
<br />
Charlie had been so focused on his chest that he hadn&#39;t even noticed how constricted his shorts had become.  Once they shredded themselves off him, he had a brutal reminder that his legs, ass, and cock had been painfully imprisoned.  In fact, his penis -- oh, his penis! He thought, as he felt it waggle around semi-freely -- was still bundled up in his briefs.  The strained undergarment was very nearly a thong, with his ass swallowing it up at the back, but it was stretched tight at the front as his cock, balls, and ass all challenged it.<br />
<br />
Though his shorts were destroyed, he could still feel his waistband resting on his hips, which had not grown as much.  “Well, there&#39;s not much point in these,” Charlie laughed as he reached down with one hairy paw and tore it off in a single motion.<br />
<br />
Charlie was just thinking about doing the same to his briefs, as he was uncomfortably large down there, but he was interrupted by the machine clicking off and changing course.  Charlie decided that he could wait another round, since he was going to shrink a bit anyway.<br />
<br />
“Please sir, can I have some of that?” Lee asked, and Charlie noticed that Lee looked even smaller than when he started.  Charlie must have grown quite a bit taller than he had realized!  Doing some quick calculations about his body -- the only kind he was good at -- he reckoned he was about nine inches taller than Lee now, and possibly coming close to 300 lbs.  Almost big enough, Charlie thought.  He wanted to make sure that no one would ever be bigger than he.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose...&quot; Charlie answered, bemused by his own thoughts.  He didn&#39;t mind Lee getting in on the growth, as long as he was still top dog.<br />
<br />
Charlie, of course, only inspected himself as his muscles changed size.  Even though he didn&#39;t like them getting smaller, it still made him very aroused to see how large and hairy he already was.  Interestingly, he didn&#39;t seem to be getting less hairy even as he lost mass.<br />
<br />
Even more interestingly, Charlie never noticed that Lee had grown twice as much as before.</p>
