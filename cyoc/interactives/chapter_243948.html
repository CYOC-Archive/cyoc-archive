<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the shower, Ty transformed his body back to normal, and they made love again. Then they got serious about cleaning themselves, so they could get dressed for dinner. As they were finishing up, Lisa asked, &quot;So how was it that we wound up in a space station orbiting Jupiter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; said Ty, and started explaining as they toweled dry, and started getting dressed. He explained how after he had transformed her into every man&#39;s cock, over four billion of them, he&#39;d waited an hour, as she&#39;d requested, before transforming her back. He told her how he&#39;d been unable to transform her back, and the series of things he&#39;d done to understand the problem, her being split into too many fragments that were too small.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I asked you not to split me,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I wanted just a single me, inhabiting ALL of the cocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty explained what he&#39;d realized, about how when he originally split his cock, while she was it, that it wasn&#39;t so much splitting her as copying her, and that it was when he had made the single her into all four of his cocks, that was what split her. And that had worked out OK, but doing the same thing to make her four billion cocks had been disastrous. She&#39;d been spread, or perhaps sliced, far too thin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems counterintuitive,&quot; she said, &quot;but I guess I&#39;ll take your word for it. Definitely when I was your four cocks, I only felt that there was one _me_, even though I was in four cocks. But if transforming into four billion cocks tore me into that many pieces, no wonder I felt terrible, and couldn&#39;t do anything. I couldn&#39;t really even feel what any of the cocks were doing, let alone enjoy anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty continued explaining what he&#39;d done to find her fragments, gather them together, and how he&#39;d failed to reassemble her. &quot;Your fragments couldn&#39;t just be joined together willy-nilly. You were like a 3D jigsaw puzzle, and every piece had to be in the right place. I wasn&#39;t able to just wish it done, but trying to do it manually would have taken me many years. Much more than my natural lifespan. Much longer even than the remaining life of the sun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like an even worse problem than the first time I was your cock,&quot; Lisa said, &quot;when the mental changes made me resist your transforming me back, and then even when you did, I wasn&#39;t myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way it wasn&#39;t as bad,&quot; Ty said, &quot;because I knew that your mind and body were still basically intact, though split across four billion pieces. But in a way, you&#39;re right, it was worse, because the the amount of work needed to put your pieces back together was much greater. Although I ultimately accomplished it in only an hour, rather than the week it took to rebuild your mind before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do that? And I still don&#39;t understand why we were orbiting Jupiter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting to that,&quot; Ty said, and continued explaining how once he realized that he wasn&#39;t going to be able to put her pieces back together by hand, he&#39;d tried his computer. &quot;My computer wasn&#39;t anywhere near powerful enough,&quot; he said. &quot;I had to expand its memory, and even then, it said that it was going to take 10 trillion years to put you together!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s eyes bugged out when she heard that. &quot;But you said that it took you only an hour! How is that possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty explained how making a copy of the El Capitan supercomputer in his (greatly expanded) bedroom, and how that was still going to take five million years. &quot;I had to either come up with a better approach, or a much more powerful computer. And El Capitan is the most powerful computer in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you came up with a better way?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I tried to think of one, but couldn&#39;t,&quot; Ty explained. &quot;So that only left the approach of using a more powerful computer. And I needed to get you put back together in less than half an hour, to be in time for dinner, since I wasn&#39;t going to be able to do all of this in our bedrooms with the special alarm clock time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that meant you needed a computer many billions of times faster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Ty confirmed. &quot;And it wasn&#39;t practical to construct that by expanding my bedroom, although I tried. I was able to make the room big enough, and then I couldn&#39;t even see to the other side. But apparently I can&#39;t actually create matter out of nothing.&quot; He explained how he thought that he had only a limited pool of mass to draw from for creating things. &quot;So I had to get the mass for the 100 billion times bigger computer from somewhere, and it had to be somewhere where it wouldn&#39;t much be missed. That pretty much ruled out Earth, the moon, and Mars. But then I thought about Jupiter.&quot;<br />
<br />
He explained creating the space station and computer in Jupiter orbit, from some of Jupiter&#39;s mass. &quot;And there was also a problem with getting enough power.&quot; He explained the hyperspatial power conduit from the core of the sun to the station&#39;s power systems. &quot;Frankly that was the least well conceived part of the whole plan, so I&#39;m astounded that it worked. But it did, the supercomputer worked, I ran the program, and you were reassembled in less than 20 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s amazing!&quot; Lisa said. &quot;So are you going to turn the computer and space station back into their original part of Jupiter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Ty. &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re hurting anything. And maybe they might be useful again someday. Besides, even though we can&#39;t publicly reveal it now, and no one would believe us, we should preserve some evidence proving that we were the first humans to venture beyond Earth orbit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled. &quot;That&#39;s pretty damned cool, now that you mention it. But I suppose no one will discover the station for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure,&quot; Ty said. &quot;The waste heat had to be radiated out into space by giant radiator fins on the station, and those glowed red hot. They probably weren&#39;t visible to the naked eye from earth, but if any astronomer had been looking with a telescope, they would have seen that something odd was happening. And if they looked in infrared, well, it would have been the second brightest object in the solar system. It will probably take a long time for the station to cool down, so it seems highly likely that it will be discovered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact,&quot; Ty continued, &quot;this proved that my teleportation is instantaneous, not limited by the speed of light. Jupiter is about 50 light minutes away from Earth right now. If the teleportation was at light speed, just getting there and back would have used an hour and forty minutes. So even if astronomers are looking at Jupiter, they still won&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary for another half hour or so, since we&#39;ve been in our special time bubble since just after we teleported back. It will be interesting to see if there&#39;s anything in the news about Jupiter in the next few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shall we resume normal time now?&quot; Lisa asked. Ty nodded, and she turned the knob on the alarm clock back to normal.<br />
<br />
The timing was just about perfect, as only moments later, there was a knock at Ty&#39;s bedroom door.</p>
