<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having had had own tongue for dinner. which Jen tried her very hardest not to think about (she had a new tongue no,w and if she was being honest she preferred this one a LOT)<br />
<br />
That evening, Jen went to bed early, intent on spending the next day experimenting with he new powers.<br />
<br />
she spent a little more time playing with her new tongue in bed, teasing her nipples before falling into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Jen Woke up early, having set the alarm on what woudl usually be a  very early hour for her. after znoozing the alarm once or twice, she shot up. remembering youesterday and immediatly extending her tongue, and yep it was still the long octopus sentacle, which she swapped her former tongue with. &#39;this feels just as normal as my old tongue felt&#39; jen thought, only slightly disturbed at how little she was missing her old tongue<br />
<br />
as Jen dressed herself she ended up only putting on pantoes and shorts, intent on experimenting a bit using Candice first she and her youner sister haven&#39;t gotten along for a few years now. and Jen finally decided to take a little bit of revenge for those years.<br />
<br />
Sneaking to her sister&#39;s bedroom she entered, knowing from experience that Candice was a Deep Sleeper and having used that fact for more then a few other revenge actions.<br />
<br />
taking the covers of her sister, jen jerked back a bit. She was naked! apparenly her sister preferred sleeping in the nude. which suiter jen just fine, it made her job a lot easier after all. The first thing she did was remove her sisters breasts, popping them of with little effort. taking a short tiem to look at them, they were larger then her own, and while both girls were beautiful in their own way, it was Jen who had most of the smarts. while her youger sister got the better deal in the beauty department. with a slim and fit figure, yet also a hourglass figure that made most girls green with envy. Jen herself had to work for her fit figure spending a significant chunk of the week on excercize, in addition to her cheering practice. While her sister just grew up having it without needing to do any work for it and she still had breast a good cup size bigger then hers<br />
<br />
Well, that was about to change if Jen had anything to say about it, peeling off her own preasts, she lowwered them to the middle of her torso befor plopping them back on, confident that the Curse would normalise their new location, and then attaching her sister&#39;s bigger breasts onto her chest where her own breasts used to sit. it went perfectly, and after a bit if testing, using the suckers on her tongue to play with her upper nipples and her hands to play with her lower breasts, she confirmed everything was in working order. (And noting with a slight pang of envy that her sister&#39;s nipples were a Lot more sesitive then her own)<br />
<br />
Deciding she was done for now, Jen returned to her own room to continue dressing up, and noting with some slight amusement that the reality change was quite comprehensive, as her Bra now had 4 cups, 2 bigger ones in the top and 2 smaller ones below that, able to support all 4 of her breasts. after struggeling a bit to get this new bra on she once again noted how natural having 4 breasts felt. feeling confident that all would be seen as normal Jen made her way down for breakfast.<br />
<br />
as Jen was preparing breakfast she heard some stumbeling form behind, looking around she saw her sister making her way to the table, completely topless and pouring herself some Tea. Jen had to smirk at the sight of her breastless sister, noting her utter lack of awareness that the breasts that were the envy of many were now Jens.<br />
<br />
After eating her breakfast Jen jumped into her car and made her way to the mall. Hhe had Decided to keep the tentacle tongue, but she wanted a bit more, and with the dexterity her tongue provided, she knew what body part she wanted to replace next. making  her way to the seafood isle she found what she was looking for. mor octopus tentacles meant for use in sushi. Taking 10 of the tentacles, all around the same length of around 2 feet she grabbed her left thumb, removing it, and then doing the same with her pinky, Ring, Middle nad Index fingers, after looking at the fingerless hand for a moment, jen went to work, replacing each finger with a tentacle. when she was done. she looked at her new left hand, it looked strange for sure but after only a little bit of practive she found she had enough control over it, as if she&#39;s had them her whole life, which, with how the curese worked, it might as wel have been, repeating the same process with her right hand she was soon the Proud owner of 10 tentacle fingers which she could control with the same texterity as her tongue. but without tasting everything like her tongue could.<br />
curling her much longer finger, Jen took 10 more tentacles and went looking around buying a few more knickknacks she thought might be interesting to test with her powers, making full use on the suckers now lining the inside of her tentacle fingers.<br />
<br />
As she made her way back hime she tested he new tentacle fingers a bit more and fond that, with a little bit of effort she could basically drive the car one handed, using the reach and increased strength of her tentacle fingers to operate the car<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
as she came inside she saw her sister lounging behind the TV wathing some movie that jen currenly wasnt interested in, what she WAS interested in was one final test, having already removed her sisters breasts while she was sleeping she would now test if she could remove limbs without others noticing even while they were awake. as it turned out, Candice didnt even react when Jen removed he sister&#39;s arms. it seems like if she did anything with the intent of removig a bodypart, the target would completely ignore her as she removed their limbs and other bodyparts looking at her now armless sister, jen took out one of the things she bought: a pair fake wooden arms, with doll joints, but missing its fingers that jen found in a bargain bin in the mall after helping herself to the new pair of arms, placing them directly below her own, Jen went to work, removing all the fingers and repacing them with the 10 tentacles she bought at the store, and attaching he sisters fingers in the fingerless doll arms that she had, and attaching them to Candice. the doll arms were relatively well cared for despite missing their fingers before jen replaced them, but  both the wrists and elbows joints were slightly creaky. And as Candice continued watching whatever it is she was watching, Jen had to hold in her snickers as she heard her sister&#39;s brand new, yet slightly creaky arms move<br />
<br />
&quot;You really have to do some maintnance on those arms, sis&quot; Jen said as she was trying to hold in her snickers<br />
Candice shot Jen a Glare &quot;Well, you should try being born with wooden arms miss Tentacles&quot; <br />
Jen waved it off, &quot;yea yea, i know i wont bother you any longer&quot; <br />
<br />
As Jen made her way upstairs back to her room, she prepared herself, she would be spening the rest of the day doing a mix of experimenting with the various Props she bought for herself and masturmation. using the tentacle fingers on her lower arms to grope her lower boobs, she once again noted how natural her new body feels</p>
