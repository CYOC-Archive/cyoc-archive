<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He left the building but was unable to concentrate on anything but his  new sexiness- the muscle, the hair, his huge cock. He wanted to badly to test out his new body but that he needed some clothes before he could get anywhere. He turned the corner and walked to a trendy little clothes store. He picked out a few muscle T's and some shorts and flip-flops to show off his huge, hairy calves and big masculine feet. <br />
<br />
He went to the counter to pay. On the other side of the counter was a (comparatively) short Latino teenager looking bored out of his mind. He was moderately attractive- he had beefy arms and a handsome face. <br />
<br />
He held out his hand for the money, but Ryan pulled his arm toward him and put the other hand around the back of his spiky black haired-head. He pulled it towards his face and breathed his sweet breath in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-my names Diego&quot; he said, looking up into Ryan's deep brown eyes.<br />
&quot;I'm Ryan,&quot; Ryan responded. &quot;You wanna get out of here?&quot;<br />
Diego nodded, looking anxious.<br />
Ryan leaned in further and their lips touched. He began to kiss him deeply, both their eyes closed. It was Ryan who finally pulled away. He winked and said in his new deep voice &quot;Let's get to my place.&quot; He Threw on one of the shirts and led Diego by the hand out of the store.<br />
<br />
Ryan figured it would take about five minutes for the spell/virus to start affecting Diego, and since he lived about five minutes from the store, it should work perfectly. His parents were on a trip and wouldn't be home for a few days. Diego stayed silent as they walked quickly down the sidewalk, Ryan's tanned, lightly hairy hand holding Diego's.<br />
<br />
As they started up the path to Ryan's house, Diego stopped suddenly, looking sick. Ryan knew what was happening and helped him into the house. Ryan laid him down and tore of his shirt and could see that the transformation had already started. A six pack was quickly appearing where he had previously only been flat. His pecs also started to define themselves as his nipples grew slowly larger. His face was growing handsomer- his jawline became more squared and his eyes a deeper brown. His legs and arms also started to dramatically expand.<br />
<br />
Diego jumped up when he realized what was happening. Ryan showed him to a full length mirror and his eyes widened and his jaw dropped. <br />
<br />
And then the hair- oh God, the hair! It started to grow out from his increasingly uncomfortable pants, forming at first a line up to his navel and then widening in to a triangle, and then upward across his new six pack, the hair growing wildly over the ridges and in the valleys created by the rock-hard muscle. In the blink of an eye his smooth face had developed a dark five o'clock shadow which grew high on his cheeks and low on the front of his neck. <br />
<br />
The hair in his pits started growing quickly as the hair on his abs shot upward to connect with the short, dark hairs growing in between his pecs and around his nipples. Dark, straight hair also grew across his now muscular legs and forearms.<br />
<br />
Diego had watched his transformation silently in the mirror as Ryan stood by and removed his clothes. When it became obvious that the change had stopped, or at least slowed, Ryan stepped closer to Diego.<br />
He came from behind and put his arms around Diego, who was still sizing up his new body in the mirror. Ryan started to kiss his ear and Diego turned his head around to meet his mouth. They both began to explore Diego's body, four hands moving across the vast expanse of muscle and hair.<br />
<br />
Ryan broke away and was the first to speak, &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;<br />
Diego answered in a voice much deeper than his own, &quot;Theres seven people on a water polo team, you know. Who's next?&quot; Ryan smiled and kissed and began to explore his new friend's body with his tongue.</p>
