<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen headed home and once inside the house felt safe from the evil designs of Miss Davidson. Feeling warm and having been nervous in her encounter with a true devil of the realm she had perspired greatly.<br />
<br />
The thought of a warm and relaxing shower made Jen feel better as the girl quickly readied to do just that. A flick of the faucets as water and steam flowed. Jen flopped a towel over the glass door of the shower stall and stepped into the cloud of steam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like stepping into hell with that devil Davidson!&quot; thought Jen to herself.<br />
<br />
As the hot water rained down over Jen's long flowing hair the room began to fill with steam and demonic static. Eyes closed Jen reached out to where the soap should have been. A pouty hands searched for what was supposed to be where it always was only to pickup a new bar of Hell Fury soap.<br />
<br />
Rolling the bar of soap over and over in her hands while still standing under the warm waterfall of a shower Jen began to smear the suds in all directions.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the words of Miss Davidson seemed to speak out in the shower room as though she was right there with Jen. &quot;Be you well aware of the sensual form I'd offer for you to walk the earth!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping the soap a fear filled young person began to grab for the towel to dry and clear her eyes.<br />
<br />
Slamming off the water she stopped the rolling cloud of steam. Jen peered over the glass shower door into the remainder of the shower room. Looking out, then down, then all around she saw nobody and still the door to the rest of the house was still closed and locked for privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wild, she's driving me wild to imagine her as some demon, I must be some kind of ass to think she had such powers!&quot; said Jen as she started the water raining down again.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the corner seat she let the water pour over her head as fingers worked the soap into her hair. A relaxing warmth ran over her as if she could almost fall asleep. Hair soaped well she again let the water pour down and dropping her arms to her sides leaned back enjoying the feelings about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Jen said as she jolted awake. &quot;I must have dozed off for a second!&quot; Yet now the showers warmth had turned rather cold. The water had run so much the hot water heater in the basement was void of any warmth. Now the water was cold and getting colder by the second.<br />
<br />
Slapping off the faucet with her elbow Jen reached again for her towel. This time the finger tried to grasp at it but felt dull even though she could feel something there. Eyes blurred from water she rubbed her face into the hanging towel.<br />
<br />
Now cold and wet the chilled air hit the wet body. A shiver and popping goosepimples made Jed shudder. Pushing the shower door open she went to step out of the shower and stand before the sink counter mirror.<br />
<br />
Normally she'd just step down to the tile floor, but as she stepped her leg bent and foot raised high off the floor. A step down proved the tile floor to be very slippery, this too was something very odd.<br />
<br />
Eyes still blurry, Jen reached for the towel. Stumbling and unsteady she fumbled for the towel again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn you Jen your such an uncoordinated ass!&quot; she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
At last the towel was in her grasp and she rubbed her face dry. A turn to the mirror showed just how uncoordinated a Ass could look. There peering back from the mirror was the very mature head of one black hairy Ass. <br />
<br />
Two long black fuzzy ears stood high off her head. A white inner fuz highlighted the stalking ears and made them seem a rather interesting flare. A sprig of white hair told of a stubbled mane running down the much longer and much broader neck.<br />
<br />
A previous full chest which only a short time before held her pride pair of perky tits was now flat but solid of strong muscle. Shoulders were narrowed and as she raised and arm the earth shaking sight of her foreleg and hoof made Miss Davidson's words ring in her head again. &quot;Be you soon well aware the sensual form I offer for you to walk the earth!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning the girl's mindset wanted to see just how interesting a form she did ware. A strong back covered again in jet black hair and the white mane being a striking flare which made Jen smile inside. Her hip which both she and young males loved so well now flared wider. A rope like hairy tail with a white switch bobbed on the end gave her a shiver of delight at it's very different beauty.<br />
<br />
Turning again she placed both forelegs and hoof solidly on the sink counter for equal support. Jen looked into the mirror and then the fact suddenly hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm different! I'm not me I'm a Ass! I, I said it twice! I said I felt like an Ass and I said I was an uncoordinated Ass, and so I am! My colors are wrong for the type of animal that is certianly uncoordinated! I am very awkward in how I step and move this all is very strange!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen felt dizzy and shook her head which sent a very Donkeyed shudder down the length of her new form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I not affraid of this, it seems so very normal! I...I...Oh God look at me!&quot; thought Jen as she looked into the mirror with renewed terror.<br />
<br />
The sensual feelings, the sensual view, was rapidly making a sensual response. Looking in the mirror Jen watched in absolute horror as a huge Ass's male organ strained forward to be erect in the air. As with every small move the shaft wavied about throwing back sensual feeling of building male Ass lust.<br />
<br />
Slowly at first Jen felt and saw her pelvic actions of a male thrusting as if enthrawled in the act of sex. As the thrusting rate increased the cock end flared flat but with a flanged edge. Harder and stiffer it felt as the moment of explosion built down inside two softball size black sacked testicles.<br />
<br />
Then she closed her large round brown eyes as the feeling was even more intense. &quot;It's coming!&quot; Jen thought to herself. As then the surge to Donkey Ass semen roared down the length of that shaft. First drips of cumtrickled and tickled down the shaft. Then with more pelvic thrusts the volume spewed out in thick globs and chucks while spits and spurts of yellow cum spewed in all directions.<br />
<br />
As the passion subsided Jen opened her eyes to see the mirror stuck and running of Donkey cum and drying chunks of her semen. The new scent was both strange to Jen and yet a familar odor to the Donkey mind which now held one human soul.<br />
<br />
Hearing a noise Jen turned her head to gaze toward the bathroom door. The handle turned slowly and the lock unset itself as the door opened. There standing in a very human female form was Miss Davidson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be you aware of the sensual form I offer for you to walk the earth?&quot; asked Jen's teacher and owner.<br />
<br />
A ragged Bray roared out of Jen's throat as if to state her feelings of horror and inner fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, you life as both girl and human is wiped from history. You are and shall be as those who you would have had control over. The Jennifer inside this Jack of an Ass will fade till all that be is a male Ass looking and being as if born the Ass he is and you are!&quot; with that Jen stepped down off the counter and walking aside the demon went out the front door and into a world of new experiances.<br />
<br />
A short walk and she found herself a willing part of the City park Service as one of eight Donkeys in the petting zoo.</p>
