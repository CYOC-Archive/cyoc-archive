<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The final two to arrive were the twins Jeffrey and Neal. Though Mary only spotted Neal standing on the porch when she opened the door to greet them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mrs Danaher.&quot; Neal said with a smile and large wave, his melon sized testicles slightly rocking from his movement. Mary could see he had a slight erection. <br />
Neal spotted that Mary had become aware and went a bit red when he smiled. &quot;Oops, sorry Mrs Danaher, it&#39;s been needing a release since I left home, long bus ride, and you know how they can fill up so quickly these days.&quot; Patting his balls almost proudly. <br />
<br />
Neal was right, Mary was fully aware of how often Gavin needed to ejaculate to release the continuous semen build up. What used to be a taboo for his mother (or anyone for that matter) to see him masturbate, has for the last 2 years become a routine necessity. For the sake of his comfort, he had to do it whenever and wherever he could, home, school or in public, though Gavin did still try to keep it to his room and bathroom as much as he found possible (bless his heart).<br />
<br />
&quot;Gavin has a pump and disposal unit in the bathroom for that purpose that you&#39;re welcome to use before you head down to where the boys are. Is Jeffrey not coming this evening?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; Replied a voice from behind Neal. Neal turned his body to reveal his brother hanging backwards from his back. <br />
<br />
What Mary originally thought was some weird flesh coloured backpack straps were actually his arms and legs bent backwards, almost unnaturally, around Neal&#39;s shoulders, very much functioning as straps. His hands were holding onto his ankles to connect the upper and lower limbs. Jeffery was the same size as Mary had seen him last, but he had a very large and lumpy stomach protruding outward. His scrotum hung below, obscuring Neal&#39;s pump buttocks. Unlike his twin, he didn&#39;t have the yoga ball sized testicles he once had. Instead the scrotum while still as large itself seemed flat and empty. With one small rectangular lump visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffrey? I didn&#39;t see you there. What ridiculous experiments has the company forced you to participate in to get you to be like this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh this?&quot; Jeffery smiled, &quot;This was totally my idea. It&#39;s awesome, I can fit all Neal&#39;s stuff inside me and get to chill on his back wherever he takes me. I&#39;m totally the perfect backpack companion hehe.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ohhh...okay, but I can&#39;t imagine your parents would be very happy having your whole future potential be reduced to an inanimate object?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ha yeah they were furious that I had volunteered for this, but that doesn&#39;t matter anymore, it&#39;s permanent.&quot; He replied with a wink and a &#39;shit-eating&#39; grin as her son would rudely say.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jeffery&#39;s mind went back to the moment all this happened. Standing up at the front of the class, the device wrapped around him. The teacher, Mr Kay, activated the machine with a deafening hum. In an instant, a jolt of odd, almost euphoric pleasure surged through him as his bones dissolved into a pliable substance. He felt his internal organs melt away, leaving only his skull and brain intact, suspended in what was now a stretchy, floppy body. His massive exercise ball-sized nuts deflated as his testicles disintegrated within, leaving a large skin flap between his legs. His torso flattened like an empty bag, with his arms and legs reshaping themselves into straps that dangled loosely on either side. Demonstrated by Mr Kay, Jeffery’s jaw unhinged and stretched wide, forming an elastic opening, ready to hold whatever was placed inside. The transformation was swift, bizarre, and irreversible—leaving Jeffery a strange, sentient vessel for others to carry.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Neal, full erection at this point, starts removing Jeffery from his back and politely passes him over to Mary by left arm-leg strap. <br />
&quot;Apologies Mrs Danaher, I don&#39;t think I can wait any longer to release myself. If it&#39;s ok could you drop Jeffery and my stuff down with Gavin while I use the pump you kindly offered?&quot;<br />
The tip of the poor boy’s erect penis began to get moist, something Mary often would see whenever Gavin needed a release. She nodded and offered direction to the bathroom before taking Jeffery from him. Happily, Neal started waddling down the hallway, balls impending his movement every step of the way.<br />
<br />
It was very odd holding Jeffery, he felt roughly the same weight of a normal bag full of overnight gear, maybe slightly heavier with his head attached. The arm she held felt exactly like skin, but without bone made it very flexible. <br />
With an awkward smile to the human backpack Mary said, “I’ll get Gavin to bring you down to your friends while your brother is busy Jeffery, if that’s ok?”<br />
“Of course Mrs D,” Jeffery smiled back, though unable to turn his head to look at her while hanging the way he was. <br />
“Gavin, your friend Jeffery is here. Could you bring him down for me?”<br />
“Just Jeffery?” came a shout from below, audibly confused and concerned.<br />
As Gavin dragged himself up the stairs to retrieve Jeffery, His mum clarified, “Nolan is here too, he is just getting freshened up in the bathroom first.”<br />
“Sweet!” Gavin said and extended his prehensile penis over to grab Jeffery like a third limb. His penis scooping up the human bag through one of the arm loops and pulling his mate into his arms for better support. He returned to the basement shouting, “Send him down here once he’s finished having a wank then. Thanks!”<br />
<br />
Almost as if she was exhausted, Mary sat down on the couch. <br />
*What on earth is going on at that school? That company is finding any and all ways to use our children as disposable guinea pigs. When will my baby boy end up being part of some extreme demonstration like his friends? The oversized testicles and heightened semen production was life altering enough. Then being declared property and made permanently nude before being given a  and a prehensile penis. Maybe I should have done what Samuel’s parents did and had him castrated before all this happened. At least their kid is a free person right now.*</p>
