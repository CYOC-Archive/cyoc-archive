<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phase II:<br />
<br />
&quot;A body part will turn to stone each time the subject ejaculates. The subject becomes hornier than the last time it ejaculated. It shall continue until all body parts have turned to stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stone!? Like. A statue!? I&#39;m going to be a statue?&quot; said Jeff in this stranger boy&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Jeff attempted to shut it down, but a warning flahed up on the screen:<br />
<br />
&quot;Warning: cannot shutdown or terminate while a program is running.&quot; <br />
<br />
As he was contemplating on how to shut the thing down, the thought of becoming a statue of a boy made him get erect. He almost unconscionably started rubbing his much reduced, hairless little penis. The he started masturbating with it, and he came.<br />
<br />
His right hand, fingers bent in the shape of a backwards C, froze solid into place! It then turned gray, and became very hard! Gasping, he tried opening his hand, but there was zero movement. He couldn&#39;t even so much as twitch one of his fingers or his thumb! His entire hand was hard and stiff as a rock!<br />
<br />
Heart rate picking up, all he could do was stand there and examine his solidly frozen rocky right hand. His fingers were perfectly carved in stone. The still-foreign-looking fingernails in stark relief on the rest of his smooth little stoney fingers. The differently-shaped veins now forever frozen solid on the surface.<br />
<br />
He started panicking. Feeling his hand as being &quot;trapped,&quot; he started to try to type. &quot;Clunk!&quot; went his stoney right hand against the keyboard. Unable to even bend at the wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t type or use the mouse now!&quot; Jeff thought in alarm.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he became even more aroused than before. He started rubbing another one out. Upon finishing his third round in an hour, his left foot suddenly felt heavier when he went to stand up. <br />
<br />
Looking down at his smooth, ever-so-slightly-pudgy soft body, the same hard gray cold rock now covered his left foot up and over his ankle! He&#39;s completely incapable of moving even a single toe! <br />
<br />
He started walking over to his closet, clunking this stragner&#39;s left foot onto the wooden floorboards of his bedroom. But when he went to take the next step with his right foot while his stoney left foot was planted firmly on the floor, he couldn&#39;t flex his ankle. Instead, he was forced to bend his left knee slightly, and rest the tips of his stoney toes on the floor. He was forced to drag his left foot, due to the inability to walk right without being able to flex his ankle.<br />
<br />
Looking himself over the mirror, his face slightly warped and his eye colors changed to a bright steely gray color! His hair darkened, shortened, and &quot;swirled up&quot; on the left side of his forehead. His nose shrank a little, and became perfectly formed. So did his ears. His lips ever so slightly thickened, and his body shrank a little as he lost a little fat and became leaner, but shorter. His arms were still soft, but were a little thinner. His breast bone became a little more prominant, as his chest took on perfect proportions for a boy. His skin somewhat darkened.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the shapes of his toes and fingers changed a little as well. He was now a really cute, handsome young boy with striking eyes! He was still the same age: 11 years old. But he was shorter than before, but a LOT cuter! <br />
<br />
Looking over his smaller soft body and feeling his new little face with his little left hand, he gawked at himself in the mirror. His front teeth long, really white, and perfectly straight. They looked like little chicklet gum pieces in his mouth. <br />
<br />
Then he felt an even more intense erection coming from his yet newer little penis. Looking down, he saw his cute little body his cute little head and face was attached to! He felt himself become even more shy, despite his new natural boyish beauty.<br />
<br />
His right hand and left foot were still stuck as cold gray stone. Still in the same position as before. But both were smaller and shapelier than before. But his new perfectly shaped little penis with walnut-sized balls demanded his attention. And so, he started jerking off, and came almost immediately!<br />
<br />
Then his left hand solidified and lost it&#39;s nice tan color, opting for the dull gray of regular old stone, also in the same C shape as his right hand. Now with both hands useless, except for one thing; he was able to grip his little penis through the opening of both hands, and came again! <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he found himself outside, naked! He was standing on a piece of smooth flat rock stuck into the ground; both feet turned to stone, and both feet attached to the rock he was standing upon! He tried lifting, first one leg, then the next. He couldn&#39;t do it! He feet were both stuck fast to this rock inside this garden! His penis still being gripped by his stoney fingers of both hands.<br />
<br />
In panic, he started looking around as best he could. He was in this garden, underneath a very large, beautiful willow tree. Mulch all around with flowers and various other plants. The place looked like paradise. A place a boy like he was now would be home in. <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, he was in the back garden of this boy&#39;s REAL house. Except now, as a different boy!<br />
<br />
Then his penis became erect of its own accord. Suddenly, his entire right arm stiffened, clear to his shoulder! Now he cannot release his little boyhood even if he so desparately wanted to! <br />
<br />
&quot;Help! HELP ME! SOMEONE! PLEASE! HELP ME!&quot; He screamed in his softer, slightly higher-pitched little kid voice! A perfect boys&#39; timbre that, soon enough, would never be heard again.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEeeelp...uh. Uh! Uh! Not. Again!&quot; He said as he squirted a bit more boy batter again. Then both of his legs froze into place, as the stone spread past his knees, and up and over both sides, clear to his hips. His little bubble butt hardened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleeease! Help mee!&quot; He yelled again, as he started crying. Both terrified of being unable to move, and so publicly displayed for anyone who walks by to see. <br />
<br />
And again, another even more intense jolt hit him. There goes his entire left arm. Still left gripping his still-fleshy little boy pee-pee! Now, no longer able to ever release the thing with either hand! <br />
<br />
Again, another thunderclap, even as he tried to resist. Stone spreading down his shoulders, and up from his waist. Covering his entire torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, oh god, oh god!&quot; he kept saying in his perfect little voice over and over again, as his entire body from the neck down is locked into place.<br />
<br />
His wee-wee stiffened again. As he looked down at his body, yet another white squirt escaped his little penis. His neck was locked into place, forcing him to look down at his adorable stoney little body for the rest of eternity. Never able to ever look up from the ground again. He stood looking at an adorable stoney little body he will forever be locked inside of, unable to move even a millimeter. <br />
<br />
He left out one final cute little noise. A muffled little moaning wimper &quot;hhmmmhh&quot; as it froze his vocal cords, his lungs, and his heart. And filled in his entire body cavity with complete stone, increasing his weight  by several hundred pounds.<br />
<br />
The stone spread up his face as his facial muscles relaxed into an expressionless little look. It spread up the back of his head, over his nose. His ears, the rest of his hair, leaving the neat little swirly design of his formerly nearly black short hair on the left side on his forehead. The stone that went up his nose, met the stone coming down his forehead. The only thing left not stone, are his eyeball and his boyhood, which was now trapped in the grip of a boy&#39;s stony little hands.<br />
<br />
At the same time, a little pond developed whose edge came right up to his ground-level short little pedestal. On rainy days, that cold pond water would rise to meet and cover his neat stoney little toes.<br />
<br />
At the moment, all he can do is wordlessly shift his sharp steely-gray eyes back and forth in utter panic. The rest of his face stuck in the expressionless stare. <br />
<br />
Not being able to lift his head, all he can see are his perfectly formed chest, his arms and hands still latched onto his perfect little penis, and his little toes at the ends of his short legs nearly touching the new pond. He can also look side to side with his eyes, but all he&#39;s able to see is the rich brown mulch of this quiet garden he&#39;s become a part of. He can look at his reflection in the pond water. He sees his fear-filled, still strikingly beautiful eyes as part of a strange unknown little boy&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
 &quot;My face now!&quot; He thinks with alarm. A still, calm expressionless face that will forever betray his inner turmoil. His very much alive eyeballs staring back in utter disbelief.<br />
<br />
He sees his former life as a teenage 16 year old varsity high school baseball star. The youngest on the team. He was such a great ballplayer, as to actually be considered a prospect in the world of professionlism in a few years. So much potential!<br />
<br />
He thinks about the date he was supposed to go on later tonight. &quot;My date!&quot; he wordlessly and soundlessly thinks. Instead, he&#39;s now this much younger boy, 5 years his junior, standing stark naked in a strange garden of a house he knows not where. A statue dedicated to youthful male immortality.<br />
<br />
Tears start leaking out of his eyes as the thoughts of his recently former life flashes through his mind. Completely unable to go out on that date, or to ever pick up a bat or ball again. Fated to just standing here night and day while the rest of the world moves on. He would be standing here still, in two year&#39;s time when his high school class graduates. Stuck as the statue of an 11 year kid he never met in his life, rather than an 18 year old kid ready to either go to college, or be drafted into professional baseball. He&#39;ll be stuck as an 11 year old boy statue, rather than hit monstrous homeruns. Own a nice house in Florida. Marry tonight&#39;s date, and have his own kids. He&#39;ll be here, rather than attending his Hall of Fame induction ceremony 20 years from now. Just a nameless old statue forever looking at its own lower body and the same piece of dirt and old pond water. He&#39;ll never see the sun or a blue sky with white clouds again. His vision will just be of the dull gray of the body of an unmoving statue, the rich dark mulch (or weeds and grass as times slowly change around him. He&#39;ll literally be watching grass grow.) And the dark reflective mirror-like surface of water that will reflect his perfect little 11 year old boy&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
These meandering thoughts pike his penis to attention. This time, though, it is the most intense feeling he&#39;s ever felt. He&#39;d be shivering from head to toe, if statues could shiver. And with an eyewatering several pumps, one of the last ejaculations he&#39;ll ever have, comes to a crescendo and finishes. The stone covers over and freezes his left eyeball. Which essentially freezes his right eyeball into place as well. No longer able to control his eyes, he&#39;s forced to just stare straight downwards. At his lower body, and in the pond. An expressionless young boy&#39;s face staring back. His right eyeball leaks one last year, as his one strikingly beautifyl gem-like bright gray right eyeball fades into the dull gray of stone. His Iris the same color as his &quot;whites,&quot; now non-whites. Yet, his irises carved perfectly in relief on his eyeballs<br />
<br />
As his right eye solidifies, following suit with his already stony left eye, his very last tear slowly descends down his cheek right after that eye already turned to stone. It drops off onto his right hand thumb. The very first part to turn to stone. That last tear slowly absorbed into the stone and dried away. He&#39;s now left looking at the statue of a boy he knows nothing about. A boy that is now him! The irises of his eyes deftly carved into his perfectly shaped round eyes. The perfectly carved nail of his thumb facing upwards in his loose grip of his still-fleshy round shaft.<br />
<br />
There was one last piece of business. Jeff stood perfectly 100% still without the twitch of a single millimeter of non-existent muscle fiber in full-blown internal panic mode. There is only one part he can still have some control over. But he uselessly contracts the tiny little muscle up and down, trying with all of his might to escape from this stony prison. But a penis isn&#39;t something usefully practical like a hand or a foot. Despite his pure determination, he can only contract the thing forward and back. That&#39;s it. And it&#39;s mostly trapped in the grip of the cold hard stony hands of his statuefied body. <br />
<br />
His utterly desparate position made him completely and permanently erect. The feeling of ejaculation kept building up. And building up. And building up some more! He couldn&#39;t take it anymore! He NEEDED to cum! And to cum NOW! He&#39;d be breaking out in a sweat, and his body trembling, if it could still do those things. But it can&#39;t. He&#39;s utterly trapped in stone?<br />
<br />
His walnut-sized balls churning with ever more desparation, the lump of sperm FINALLY began to make its way up his little shaft. Getting closer and closer. Pre-cum started dribbling out of his tip. He&#39;d be breathing very hard and heavy if he could. An explosion of colors hit his ever-working brain. The jump of cum reaches his stupidly sensitive tip. The stone began to spread up his erected shaft very quickly. It caught up to that lump, RIGHT BEFORE it went shooting out of the tip! Instead, the lump turn to stone, an instant before his tomatoe-red tip did! It got stuck! He lost complete control over the only thing left to him! He couldn&#39;t release himself! He was stuck, RIGHT at the exact moment of climax! He&#39;d be screaming if he could. Instead, he just wordlessly and blankly stares down at himself. A perfect statue of a perfectly beautiful boy about to take a piss into a pond. <br />
<br />
His mind internally is on fire. It&#39;s red-hot with pure emotions. Panic. Nightmarish fears. Intense lust, never able to escape from! Regret. Sorrow. Desparation. Anger. Jealousy. Loud and screaming. But externally, not a peep can be heard or understood. He&#39;s just a boy statue standing ever quietly and peacefully. <br />
<br />
After 5 minutes of this, he finds himself wondering why he can&#39;t be made of something better like gold. Or silver. Afterall, a perfect young boy like him is worthy of such things. But no. He&#39;s just normal, flat gray rock! That is, a small part of his logical thinking that isn&#39;t burning with such pure intensity thinks this. He tries with all of his might to think of something else other than his permanant sexual climax. He tries to distract himself by thinking how unfair it was he wasn&#39;t gold instead. Gold bars look shinier than he does! He&#39;s just a dull, flat gray old piece of rock. <br />
<br />
He then catches himself being jealous of other inanimate objects. For that&#39;s what he is now. Inanimate! Except his mind. He doesn&#39;t even have the comfort of going insane! He&#39;s forever stuck inside his own mind awash with intense sexual frustration. Never able to fully distract himself for long. <br />
<br />
And yet, despite the war raging internally, all outside observers would see just the statue of a young boy mischievously peeing into a pond silently and unmoving. The calm stone statuefied face, masking the fiery mind.</p>
