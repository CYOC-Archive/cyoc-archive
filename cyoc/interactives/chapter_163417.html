<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was another hot summer day and the Wilson family was back at the beach to have a fun summer day together again. The family consisted of the husband Landon, the wife Betty, and their child Max. Their buffed-out, 24-year-old, Adonis of a son, but their son none the less.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about stuff Dad, I can handle it myself.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure bud? I can help if you…” But before Landon could finish his sentence, Max had already picked up everything in the trunk of the and was now looking for the perfect spot to put everything down. Landon should have known Max would be able to do it. After all, ever since Max changed, he was the one who helped Betty bring in the groceries in record time. Not to mention the time when he carried that dresser all by himself. And there was that time where he…<br />
<br />
“Hey Dad!” Oh, it seems like Max had already finished setting up the beach stuff while he was musing. “I’m going to play volleyball with these girls, okay?” The girls in question were clearly fawning over Max. It reminded him of when girls fawned over the football players or wrestlers in high school and college. In fact, he could hear the girls over fawn how big his son’s muscles were. Just like in high school…<br />
<br />
“S-sure, just don’t stay out too long, okay?” After Max left, Landon turned to his wife Betty and said, “Hey, I’m going to go for a walk, maybe a swim too. You going to be okay here by yourself?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, honey, have a good walk,” Landon kissed his wife goodbye and once he was a good distance away, he swore at himself. He knew he shouldn’t be jealous of his son’s new buff body, but he couldn’t stop these feelings. Landon himself was in the track team in high school, and while he managed to keep his trim figure, he never could put on muscle no matter how hard he tried. All he could do was watch the lucky, muscular people with envy, and now that included his son, and he hated that. Shouldn’t it be normal for him to be proud of his son’s physique that he gained?<br />
<br />
And then it hit him. It wasn’t normal for your son to suddenly become an Adonis in a few minutes. It wasn’t normal for your son to grow up to the point where he could be mistaken for your younger brother. And it certainly wasn’t normal for a statue to make you grow muscle! None of this was normal! Landon knew what he had to do, and thankfully that statue was hard to miss.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Sam’s beach, blah blah blah. Yup this was it, if he touched this statue, then he would become a strong and buff like Max, right? One part of him was hesitant, after all even though it worked well for Max, it doesn’t mean the same thing will happen to him. What if there was some side effect that they didn’t know about or something like that? However, all those concerns were drowned out by the other part of him. The other part of him was envious of the muscular men he saw everywhere, envious that they possessed something he desired. He wanted to be strong and buff so badly he touched the statue.<br />
<br />
Instantly as he touched the statue Landon was thrown back due to an electric shock. The shock caused all the father’s muscles to pulsate at once. Briefly he thought that his concerns were true, and he made a grave error. However as soon as it started, the pulsing stopped, and it  Landon with left with a more muscular body. It actually worked; he wasn’t a stick anymore! That being said, his body wasn’t anything special however, he looked like a person with good genetics that only worked out occasionally. That wasn’t enough for Landon though, he wanted more! So, he touched the statue again without hesitation.<br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly, the same thing happened once he touched the statue again. Again, he was hit with an electric shock, and once again all his muscles were pulsing at once, but this time Landon kept his eyes open to see his body slowly bulking up.<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah! I’m finally a hunk!” He said while flexing his new guns. He felt great like the statue had promised and had the body of a fitness model, abate a body that was still smaller than his son, but Landon didn’t care about that right now. He was too busy being elated about his new muscles.<br />
<br />
“So, this is what it&#39;s like to have pecs.” It was the muscle group he was the most interested in. He could imagine what it was like to have big arms or rock-hard abs, but pecs? Not really, but now that he has them, he loved having that weight of them in the front. He cupped his pecs and gave them a squeeze, relishing in the feeling of the hard mounds, and then he flexed them making them dance.<br />
<br />
“So… hot.” It was now when Landon wanted to touch the statue again, to hopefully reach or even surpass the body his son has. However, then he looked down at his swim trunks, to see them straining against his quads and thick abs. One more touch could make him burst out of his trunks, and walking around naked wasn’t something he wanted, not to mention it would leave a bad impression for Max.<br />
<br />
This left Landon questioning what to do next…</p>
