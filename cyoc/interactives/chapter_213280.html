<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Palseks wasn’t ”used” after that, though Karsor was still the slave minder. <br />
<br />
He fed her meals still, but now bites were taken out of her bread and meat. The kobold clearly blamed her for the dressing down he’d received and was paying her back. Every time he saw her, he’d call her a whore. Which…was true, but he also liked slapping her around when Rakser wasn’t looking. Not enough to leave marks, but she was bruised and half-starved after a month.<br />
<br />
She was in her own cell, as opposed to the rest of the slave kobolds. They were afraid she might get knocked up. Which was why, when she felt cramps a month later and vomited every morning, that she realized Finn or Karsor had managed to impregnate her. <br />
<br />
It was thrilling and terrifying all at once. <br />
<br />
All Palseks had ever wanted was to be a gravid, heavily pregnant reptile. But now, instead of rubbing her swelling belly with love and tenderness, she could only hope no one noticed the eggs bumping out her belly. Of course, she still enjoyed playing with herself, rubbing her ventand playing with her tail. It was painful but oddly pleasurable as well, like scratching an itch. Relieving might be a better word. Everything was becoming sore and achey.<br />
<br />
Worse, they were moving her onto a caravan to Chloa Claithe or something. It was a foreign word, sounding vaguely Irish, and her little kobold mind had difficulty pronouncing it anyways. That wasn’t the problem. If she was outside all the time, her pregnancy would be revealed.<br />
<br />
She realized she needed an excuse. If they thought Kalsor had impregnated her, she’d be forced to abort - and she could only imagine how they would go about doing that in the fantasy world she now found herself in. But if some other guard, someone much higher in station thought her eggs were theirs…she might be able to lay them. <br />
<br />
And as strange as it was, something inside of her desperately wanted to experience the pain and discomfort of laying an egg. The idea of squatting down as she pushed a hard, heavy egg out through her vent was the hottest thing she could think of.<br />
<br />
Palseks also needed more food. Her fat stores were dwindling and half-eaten plates of already meager food wasn’t enough to feed parent and child. She needed someone to take care of her and her baby. An idiot who would believe any excuse about why their children looked so different.<br />
<br />
And one day, Karsor was sick and Rakser took over, and she had her opportunity.<br />
<br />
The massive kobold was the perfect fall guy. From what she could tell, he was rather dumb, but had a soft spot for her. He’d feed her treats from the city when he could. And now he was outside her cell, doing his nightly rounds.<br />
<br />
She knew what she had to do. <br />
<br />
Acting quickly, she pulled out a series of forks, their tines bent upwards. Scattering them like jacks near the door, just out of the way of the sweep, she waited a few hours until the other guard on shift fell asleep. Then she moaned as though in pain.<br />
<br />
She heard him stand and hesitate outside her cell door. Palseks moaned a little loader, pouring all the aches she was experiencing into it. The door opened and Rakser rushed inside, not minding where he placed his feet. His bare foot slammed on the tines of two forks and they pierced the scutes.<br />
<br />
“Gah!” Rakser cried, tumbling to the floor.<br />
<br />
Palseks heard the guard outside snort, sounding half-awake. She considered making her escape now, but Rakser would surely catch her or raise the alarms. Instead, she poured on the charm. She was a kobold sex slave, after all.<br />
<br />
“Ah!” She gasped, rushing to his side and holding his foot. “You hurt?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Rakser gasped, jaw clenched and eyes squeezed shut in pain.  Getting stabbed through the scales of your foot scutes was no joke.<br />
<br />
Acting quickly while he wasn’t looking, she swept the rest of the forks into a dark corner and pulled out the fork in his foot. Rakser continued hissing as she gingerly tested his scutes, making sure they were still intact. Which, miraculously, they were. Blood might be welling up between them, but the wounds would likely heal.<br />
<br />
However, the fork had been in her mouth, so he’d probably get a bad infection.<br />
<br />
“Me heal.” Palseks said softly.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t actually sure she could heal him. But Palseks had managed to catch a glimpse of her new character sheet while putting out the flames Finn had created. Kobold bard. Meaning she could cast cure light wounds. A basic, first level spell.<br />
<br />
A spell she didn’t know how to cast. However, it couldn’t be complicated. Bards weren’t wizards, they didn’t need to memorize spells. Most of them sang or danced. She couldn’t imagine her Performance was sex based, since that wouldn’t be feasible in the middle of a battlefield. So she thought of a kobold lullaby she’d heard someone sing in the cell across from hers and sang.<br />
<br />
“Cure Light Wounds,” Palseks whispered in draconic, following the notes of the lullaby.<br />
<br />
A light shone from between Rakser’s scutes and the blood lifted away. The big kobold’s moaning stopped. He looked up at her in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Healer?” Rakser gasped.<br />
<br />
“Shh…secret.” Palseks replied.<br />
<br />
They stared at each other a moment. Palseks continued to massage Rakser’s foot, then her hands crept up the male’s legs. Rakser’s eyes shifted, noting her movements as she brushed up his inner thighs. The kobold guard’s leathers tented and a masculine musk began to fill the room.<br />
<br />
“You like?” Palseks asked, batting her lids and wagging her tail.<br />
<br />
The navy blue-scaled kobold trembled, his tail wagging nervously behind him, as he lowered his pants and his cock sprang free.It was a small, tapered thing covered in tiny fleshy knobs – impressive for a kobold, but nothing compared to a real dragon. <br />
<br />
Palseks realized she needed to take the initiative and crawled between his legs. She spread them and ran the smooth side of her claw up his shaft. Her tongue extended, lapping at the delectable precum that dribbled from his tool.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Rakser groaned, his scaly hand pressing Palseks muzzle against his crotch as he slowly bucked his hips into her sweet mouth.<br />
<br />
Palseks opened her maw wide and took the whole length without skipping a beat. She slid up and down the shaft. His nubs and knobs brushed against her throat as she bobbed. Palseks played with those nubs as she sucked and clenched her mouth around the male’s length.<br />
<br />
With one scaly hand, she pressed up into the back of the vent that Rasker’s cock was just out from and began teasing the testicles inside - all while she continued to suck. Rakser spasmed and moaned, louder this time. She increased her bobs, feeling the male tense as he was brought to orgasm. Rakser’s dick spluttered and he began to ejaculate. She swallowed his seed down and let out a satisfied burp.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Palseks languished in her cell another month.<br />
<br />
Her meals had been much better after her mating press with Rakser. Despite his scarred, brutish appearance, Rakser was a caring kobold. That wasn’t the last time they mated either. Every night now, his thick penis stretched her vent and filled her with his life-giving seed. And despite having ulterior motives for giving herself to him, she found herself… having feelings for him.<br />
<br />
She dreamed about waking up in his arms. Of him rubbing her pregnant belly and whispering to their young. They were just fantasies, yet every fuck felt better than the last. She looked forward to it now, instead of seeing it as transactional, though in a way it was.<br />
<br />
Her days were the same as always. The caravan had stopped in a town whose name no one had bothered to tell her.  During the day, she was brough out and chained to a post in the middle of a dusty market place and left in the sweltering heat, waiting to be sold. For some reason, she never was. <br />
<br />
Every time someone approached, clearly interested, their eyes glazed over and shifted to the next kobold in line. It was that initial lusty gaze in their eyes – the thoughts going through their mind of what they could do to her body that had caused Finn the Dragon God to intervene.  Despite her new life in chains, she knew that she was somehow important to the supreme being of this world.<br />
<br />
Fucking Finn!<br />
<br />
He was such a big, stupid, sexy dragon! She wanted to worship him, feel his hemipenes in her vents. Palseks shook her head. No! She…she was… well, she was his sex slave, and to hell with it, she loved it! Personally, she couldn’t wait to get back to him after the game was over and pick up where they had left off. <br />
<br />
“Finn whelps will be so handsome and strong,” Palseks murmured to herself, rubbing her belly.<br />
<br />
Almost as soon as the words had parted her scaly lips, reality jumped.<br />
<br />
Palseks wondered what had happened. It didn’t take more than a few more belly rubs to realize what Finn had changed. Her pregnant belly was gone, leaving only a slightly built kobold in its place.<br />
<br />
She started to sob.<br />
<br />
As hot tears rolled down her snout, a flood of female hormones washed over her, causing her her body to grow warm as blood flushed under her skin. <br />
<br />
Internally, her sex set to work, a hot burst of arousal eliciting a gentle hiss from the kobold while her feminine folds moistened. The feeling of emptiness between her legs intensified so that she felt like she needed something down there, anything that would fill the void the heat demanded. Her sadness at the loss of her child and anger at Finn was forgotten. Now, her blood boiled was because she was so hot and ready for sex. <br />
<br />
Palseks shuddered as the feeling of arousal intensified. She moaned hotly, panting as she rubbed one hand along the outside of her vent, all while the other fingered the edge of her tail.<br />
<br />
But the heat didn’t stop rising within her. <br />
<br />
Palseks gasped, squirming and rubbing her thighs together, using them to press her hand up against herself in a frantic attempt to relieve her burgeoning desire for sex. But the heat inside of her didn’t slow down. She needed something else, she needed more, she needed to feel the rush of seed in her womb, the warmth of growing life that her body was all too prepared to deliver—<br />
<br />
“N-no,” Palseks whimpered, removing her hand from her crotch. She squeaked as her tail slithered under her leg and poked at her sex of its own accord. The kobold grabbed her tail and stared at it angrily. “P-please, Finn!”<br />
<br />
“Finn?” Rakser asked, walking into the cell and coming to a stop, sniffing the air.<br />
<br />
Panting and hissing, Palseks fell onto her side and rolled over onto all fours, her rear facing Rakser. Raising her tail to expose her dripping pussy, she looked over her slim shoulders, eyes clouded with lust. She shook with each passing second, tail wobbling stiffly as she waited for him to relieve her insatiable ache.<br />
<br />
“You need?” Rakser asked, though his huge cock tented his leather armor.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Need!” Palseks gasped.<br />
<br />
It played into her hand anyways. She needed to seduce one of her captors and had him in the palm of her hand. Or, in this case, the velvet lining of her vent. Palseks could smell him. Virile, needy, and strong, everything a female kobold looked for in a mate. Perhaps others would be more discerning, the kobold looked more like a blue snapping turtle than a proper kobold, but he’d do.<br />
<br />
 He sniffed her floral aroma before bending down and lapping eagerly at her nethers. She gasped and moaned around that eager tongue, his tender licks bringing her to a toe-curling orgasm. He lapped her juices off his snout and entered her, groping at her supple ass and suckling on her boobies. <br />
<br />
“Nggh!” Palseks bit back a needy moan.<br />
<br />
Those nubs on the end of his cock were perfect at stimulating her, forcing her inner muscles to clamp down on his thick dick and almost suck him in. The pleasant stretch of his huge cock was an even bigger stimulant, and the feeling of fullness was remarkably relieving. <br />
<br />
She glanced up into his eyes and it was like a spark leapt between the two.<br />
<br />
In one instant, she was just trying to get him to fuck her so she could escape. The next, she was swallowed up by his glowing yellow gaze, lost in his strong scaly arms and ruggedly handsome features. The predatory glint in her eyes softened and her tail straightened behind her, hard as a rock. Her mouth yawned into a long moan of pleasure and need. As his fat cock parted her glistening folds again, she relaxed, letting herself be taken by her reptilian lover.<br />
<br />
They rocked together, and she found herself bucking into every thrust. Her mind was tingling with strange needs and wants, urges she couldn’t understand. Her time with Finn was gently extracted while she was lost in a haze of smoky kobold musk. It was replaced with Rakser, her saviour.<br />
<br />
He thrust hard and deep, faster and faster, setting every nerve she had in her heat-swollen pussy on fire. Those nubs made her more receptive, and on his final thrust, his glans pushed into her cervix. All she could do was writhe and moan around his fat kobold cock as it spasmed, flooding her womb with his delightful warmth. The empty feeling she’d felt inside her since heat had begun ebbed away along with the remnants of her shuddering orgasm.<br />
<br />
Then he’d lain with her, stroking her naked form with his claws, as gentle as a brute like Rakser could be. Her insides churned his seeds pleasantly. It and his touch on her oddly-sensitive skin elicited happy yips of delight from the kobold’s lips.<br />
<br />
“Palseks.” Rakser’s voice trembled. “You want mate bond?”<br />
<br />
Palseks heart caught in her throat. This… this was it! Her way out! Exactly what she had been aiming for since the start of the month, when she let him have her. She let out a squeal and nodded excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Yes Rakser! Palseks love you.” She nuzzled into his broad chest.<br />
<br />
“Me love you too.” Rakser clutched her to him tight. “Me buy you tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Her tail had grown so hard at that statement it could crush a diamond. It took Palseks a moment to realize that she really, truly wanted to be mate bonded with this handsome kobold. Well, she’d be lying if she said he was handsome, but that proud, loving look on his blunt broad muzzle sent thrills through her. Deciding that if this was her life now, she was fine with it, she fell asleep on his chest, cradled in his arms.<br />
<br />
The kobold slept through the night, unaware of the lurking god that was once again reworking the inner workings of her brain.  And when she awoke in the morning, she found a sudden change in what had become the monotonous boredom of a slave’s life.<br />
<br />
Her breakfast was served by Rakser exclusively, as were all her meals, the kobold barking angrily at any who dared approach her. At first she thought it was just him doing his job as a guard to prevent pregnancies. But he was overly protective and started sneaking her snacks and treats no other slave would get.<br />
<br />
He didn’t buy her. At first she wondered why she broke his promise. Then she heard shouts and raised voices. She wandered towards the door of her cell and listened carefully.<br />
<br />
“No sale until market!” Corrak was saying.<br />
<br />
“Why?” Rakser shouted. “I buy now!”<br />
<br />
There was the sound of a money pouch hitting the table.<br />
<br />
“No! Could get better price!” Corrak replied. “Rules are rules! Slave must be rejected at auction or no internal sale!”<br />
<br />
“She get rejected tons!”<br />
<br />
“Not here!” Corrak insisted.<br />
<br />
“Pah!” Rakser stomped away angrily.<br />
<br />
The angry sex was really good that night. She didn’t bother to ask why he hadn’t bought her. It would sound overly… needy. A slave, in the kobold’s mind, was lucky not to be beaten to death or worked away in a slate mine. If she whined, she’d come off as entitled.<br />
<br />
Besides, it didn’t upset her. <br />
<br />
No one had bought her so far. The idea that someone would overcome whatever mental block Finn had placed on potential buyers was simply unthinkable. As far as she knew, only an Archmage or someone else with the power to warp the simulation could do that, and they probably weren’t browsing some backwoods marketplace looking for a kobold.<br />
<br />
A week later, they were on the move, finally caravanning to the neighboring kingdom. After they came to a stop in an otherwise typical medieval city, she was brought out of her cell and paraded around the marketplace by Corrak, the lead kobold. After the display of goods, she was stood in a line with every other kobold. It wasn’t hard to notice her – while the rest had rather dull, muted scales in browns and gray, her glossy scarlet scales stood out.<br />
<br />
“You be sexy kobold!” Corrak yapped at her when he came to inspect the slaves. “Me no feed slave I no can sell!”<br />
<br />
Palseks sighed. <br />
<br />
She’d never have to do this again after today. It was humiliating and worse, perhaps, was that no customer would ever be interested in her. She&#39;d need to listen to Corrak berate her all night until Rakser came in and parted her feminine folds with his big fat kobold cock. <br />
<br />
Palseks shivered, her vent dribbling fluid down her thigh. Was she in heat again? Or…oh gods, did she actually love the big kobold? Females could start readying themselves to be impregnated all on their own, if they fell in love. Was she going into heat because she’d truly fallen for him, then?<br />
<br />
It wasn’t supposed to be like that. She was supposed to wait for him to buy her freedom and then convince him to take her collar off and run for it. Only now, she was actually concerned about how it would make him feel, how devastated her lover would be. <br />
<br />
“What’s this?” A regal voice spoke.<br />
<br />
Palseks looked up, eyes wide as she stared at the mink in front of her. He looked incredibly familiar somehow. And, more importantly, his eyes weren’t glazing over and sliding to the next kobold in line. She’d been noticed.<br />
<br />
“Intriguing scale coloration,” the mink murmured, eyeing her appreciatively. “nothing like the rest of this sorry bunch.”<br />
<br />
“No.” Palseks agreed. “Not like others.”<br />
<br />
“Hrrmmm?” The mink cocked a brow. “You’re rather mouthy for a slave.”<br />
<br />
“Me is sorry!” Corrak leapt over to the silk-clad mink. “She not taught manners. Not slave long!”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” The mink cocked his head.<br />
<br />
“She a fresh young kobold, good for fuck!” Corrak thrust his hips and winked as well as his membranes allowed.<br />
<br />
“Disgusting.” the rich mink said and turned to look at the others in line.<br />
<br />
“Um…boss?” Rakser spoke from the kobold salesman’s elbow.<br />
<br />
The muscular, scarred kobold had crept up next to Corrak when he wasn’t looking. Palseks tried not to look behind her. She stared straight forward as the mink came back to inspect her while Corrak was distracted.<br />
<br />
“Me make sale. Art of Deal!” Corrak hissed. “What you want?”<br />
<br />
Rakser swallowed nervously and shot glances at Palseks. Corrak glanced from Palseks, who was shifting uncomfortably under the gaze of a mink nobleman, then back to Rakser. He rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“You want to mate with she?” Corrak sighed.<br />
<br />
“Have mated. Want mate bond.”<br />
<br />
“You mess with goods?” Corrak hissed.<br />
<br />
“She not fresh!” Rakser protested. “You try sell anyway.” <br />
<br />
“Yes, but me leader. It different.” Corrak shook his head. “She for sale.”<br />
<br />
“I-I buy- !” Rakser started to say, lifting his gold pouch.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take her!” A regal voice cut through the crowd.<br />
<br />
“She cost-” Corrak began.<br />
<br />
“100 gold pieces.” the mink said.<br />
<br />
Corrak glanced at Rakser and shrugged apologetically. “He pay more.”<br />
<br />
Palseks stared up at the mink in sheer horror as she was led away to the back along with him. Corrak uncuffed her manacles and slapped on a control collar. It was tight, but not uncomfortably so. He pulled out a scroll and had the mink sign his name. Once the contract was done and the magic officially binding, the collar heated up.<br />
<br />
“Come, Palseks.” the mink said as he strode away.<br />
<br />
Palseks felt the push of the collar and could nothing but follow after. Her short legs pumped and she passed Rakser. The kobold’s eyes were downcast.  She waddled over to him, her tail wagging behind her, and kissed his scaly cheek.<br />
<br />
“Me love- “ Palseks began.<br />
<br />
“Palseks, hurry up and stop dilly-dallying!” Her new master said.<br />
<br />
Rakser watched her hurry after her new master, a look of profound sadness in his eyes. <br />
<br />
Palseks maintained eye contact until her lover was lost in the throng of the crowd. They made their way to an inn near the outskirts of town, the Sit and Swill. It was well-maintained and actually had plumbing and decent food, at least from what Palseks could recall from conversations among prospective owners near her stall.<br />
<br />
Witha wave of his hand, the mink tugged her into the inn/tavern.</p>
