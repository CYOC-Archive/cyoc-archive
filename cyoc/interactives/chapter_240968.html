<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Just a reminder that Jeff&#39;s mother&#39;s name is Janet on this path and will be mentioned more after this chapter.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I put on a movie for you two, how does that sound?&quot; Emily asked her two young charges.<br />
<br />
Jeff and his mother just nodded their heads, while the latter put her thumb in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow you both sure are quiet tonight&quot; Emily questioned the toddlers strange behavior, having no idea the two were formerly adults, who were still more than a little shy about communicating with their caregiver. &quot;At least you&#39;re behaving yourselves, that&#39;s good. Anyway let&#39;s go watch that movie&quot; she cheered while leading them into the living room. Once there she turned on the flat-screen and popped a disc into the player. The menu coming up Jeff saw that Emily had picked Disney&#39;s The Lion King for them to watch, a true timeless classic. They had come out with a live action one in recent years and there was a new one in theaters at the moment that was doing pretty good. However he had grown up watching the animated version and thus it would always be one his favorites, and the fact that she had picked it out had lifted the baby boy&#39;s mood considerably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I&#39;ve got to go do homework but I&#39;ll come back to check on you two&quot; Emily promised before starting the movie with the remote and leaving the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s sit on the couch&quot; his mom said once she was gone, the baby girl already making her way to the large piece of furniture. Jeff feeling excited followed his regressed mother&#39;s lead in heading toward it. With their smaller bodies it was difficult climbing up but they managed it. Just as the two were leaning back and settling in to watch the movie their babysitter suddenly reappeared holding what  appeared to be two baby bottles filled with an amber colored liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly me, I completely forgot to give you these with your dinner. But hey at least now you have something to drink while watching your movie&quot; Emily replied trying to turn her mistake into a positive. Handing them each a bottle the teenager then swiftly disappeared.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at his baby bottle with hesitation while his mom wasted no time in sticking the nipple in her mouth, the toddler happily sucking on it as she drank from her bottle. Annoyed at once again being outdone in the baby department by his own mother Jeff started drinking from his. His anger subsided once he realized it was apple juice he was guzzling down, the chilled sweet liquid filling his belly much like the mac n&#39; cheese from dinner. They enjoyed their bottles while watching the first fifteen minutes of the film, their padded behinds adding extra cushioning. And then once they were empty casually toss them aside like any toddler would do.<br />
<br />
The movie continued on and it wasn&#39;t until the part where Simba and Nala were talking with Zazu that Jeff felt himself getting excited, knowing what was going to happen next. Sliding off the couch and toddling closer to the tv the song &quot;I can&#39;t wait to be king&quot; started to play he gave himself over to his babyish  impulse as he began to dance. He had never felt so silly and yet at the same time more free then he did in that moment while shaking his diapered butt to the Disney song. His embarrassment disappeared when his mom hopped off the couch and started dancing along with him. By the time the song finished the two toddlers were tired from the exercise, regarding each other with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a lot of fun. Now I know why you did that during movies as a baby&quot; she said still beaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it was really fun and I...&quot; He was about to say he enjoyed dancing with her but was cut off by a growing warmth in his crotch, his little hands flying to the front of his diaper. &quot;Uh oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong honey?&quot; she asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going peepee&quot; Jeff confessed with a blush, feeling his bladder cut loose in his diaper, the padding swelling as it absorbed his seemingly neverending stream. At first he was alarmed but then as he realized the garment had it covered he relaxed and allowed his body to finish. Just as the last few drops left him his mother&#39;s reply grabbed his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t the only one.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hearing that he looked over and saw the toddler girl squirming in place, the front of her diaper turning yellow while puffing up and sagging a little. When she was done going they were able to speak once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright?&quot; Jeff asked upon seeing the other shaken up by her accident.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; she whispered, &quot;Peeing myself with no control just caught off guard that&#39;s all&quot; his mom grinned. &quot;I guess that apple juice really went through us huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff simply nodded then smirked as he added, &quot;So are you still enjoying being a baby mom?<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually yeah. Despite that accident being a complete surprise it felt so good going in my diaper instead of the toilet. I&#39;ll admit though I was skeptical at first you definitely ended up being right about these things Jeff&quot; she said while gripping the sides of her soaked padding and pulling it up as it had fallen down a little.<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned in victory, both at having proven he was right and winning his mother over to his side.</p>
