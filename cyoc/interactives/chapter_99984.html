<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(After pondering it the whole time I was composing this episode, I just couldn&#39;t think of a better title.—tmw.)<br />
<br />
After getting off the phone with the detectives investigating the death of Yvette Smith&#39;s mother Margaret, Doctor Frances Twist coordinated things with the Moon Lake Hospital so there would be no problems or delays running the paternity tests to determine who the rogue were-vixen&#39;s father actually was.<br />
A part of Frances did feel sorry for Yvette if it turned out to be her uncle Bartholomew, for that would mean he and her mother carried out an incestuous relationship at some point in their lives that resulted in an unwanted daughter, based upon Yvette&#39;s statements concerning her relationship with her late mother.<br />
<i>At least neither of them appear guilty of contributing to Margaret Smith&#39;s death,</i> thought Frances. <i>The worst charges Yvette will be facing in this will be failure to report the death and not giving her mother a proper burial/disposal, if the detectives can prove she knew about her mother&#39;s passing, since it appears Margaret died long after she kicked Yvette out of the house. What kind of mother would do that to their own daughter?</i> Frances wondered, recalling the tedious relationship she had with her own parents over being a lesbian werecat married to another woman, when all the other members of the Carter family were weredogs and in straight relationships.<br />
There were several very heated arguments over the years, the latest topic being the fact that Samantha and Frances would never produce &quot;legitimate&quot; grandchildren for the Carter family to love and dote on, but at least Frances&#39; parents had never outright disowned her.<br />
Looking at her wristwatch, Doctor Twist decided to grab a bite to eat in the hospital cafeteria before calling the car service to take her back to her office in time to keep her 2 pm appointment with Jenny Harper.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The Dean and William Anderson were finishing up their respective lunches at Moon Lake College when William&#39;s cellphone rang.<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said William, as he took it out of his jacket pocket to answer. &quot;Hi honey,&quot; he said, seeing that the caller ID said it was his wife Martha on the other end.<br />
&quot;Hello yourself handsome,&quot; purred Martha, herself a werecat to his werefox. &quot;I&#39;ve studied my brains out all morning and am fixing to go run those errands I need to get done. What time do you think you&#39;ll be done for the day? I was thinking I could swing around and pick you up on my way home for the night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds like a good idea,&quot; agreed William. &quot;Maybe six-ish?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you then my love,&quot; she purred again, before hanging up.<br />
As William Anderson started to put his cellphone back in his jacket pocket, he saw the dean looking at him.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m married too. Enjoy,&quot; was all the dean said, as he went back to his lunch.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE ON CAMPUS...<br />
As Jenny Harper was about to enter her twelve o&#39;clock class, she paused in front of the classroom door and took a sniff of those around her. There was a stray werefox smell she couldn&#39;t identify.<br />
<i>I know why I&#39;m nervous, but the Skulk are the brothers and sisters of my very extended new family. I have nothing to worry about around them,</i> she told herself, entering the classroom.<br />
Her morning had gone rather decently, despite the fact that Jenny always felt like she was walking on egg shells and broken glass after events concerning the rogue were-vixen Yvette Smith and now her parents coming to ruin what should be the happiest day of her life next weekend.<br />
Professor Anderson&#39;s offer to make his family a surrogate family for her came totally out of the blue, but was welcomed, and something she&#39;d need to discuss with her fiance Harry first, since the Jenkins had basically made the same offer when their son proposed and she accepted.<br />
Besides having Harry within her life, Jenny&#39;s one moment of true happiness that day was when the Campus Career Councilor called her cellphone and said it would be easy to establish a course curriculum for her to eventually become a licensed therapist starting with the Spring semester, with most of her course credits this semester being applicable to the overall goal. The only snag in her new dream would be the need for further training under an already licensed therapist after graduating, before she would be licensed by the state herself, but Jenny wasn&#39;t worried about that as she took a seat near the back of the room.<br />
<br />
Across the hall from Jenny Harper&#39;s noon class, Yoshiro Tachibana watched the newest member of the Skulk go into the room, and then breathed a short sigh of relief.<br />
Even with the cooperation of campus security, it would not do for there to be any scene centered around Jennifer Harper, and for a moment it almost seemed like she was aware of being under surveillance. The proper steps would have to be taken to make sure their presence remained undetected.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Karen Yuletide met her new boyfriend Peter Talbot in front of the Student Union building for lunch, and gave him a big romantic kiss.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you too,&quot; he replied, after their lips parted. &quot;How&#39;s your day been so far?&quot;<br />
&quot;Great. Classes were good, and I got these,&quot; added Karen, holding up a plastic bottle with two pills in it.<br />
&quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; asked Peter, looking at her closely.<br />
&quot;Yes. My introductory prescription to the were-lioness birth control pill,&quot; she said proudly. &quot;I went to the campus health department and said I was dating a handsome man who was also a werelion, and thinking about furthering our relationship. They actually congratulated me on my initiative in preventive care.&quot;<br />
&quot;And are you? Wanting to further our relationship?&quot; he asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t lie to you. I still have my reservations about sharing you with other women, even under what would basically be the werelion equivalent to an open relationship/marriage agreement, but when I can overcome that hangup...&quot;<br />
&quot;That is a big step in any long term werelion/werelioness relationship,&quot; admitted Peter. &quot;Even some of the naturally born werelionesses need time to consider the possibilities.&quot;<br />
&quot;But if whenever we do come to that point, if a life together is what we both want and the time is right...&quot; began Karen, looking up at him, <i>because I know I do</i>. &quot;They asked me a whole bunch of questions about my current health, you, and the status of our relationship at the moment. Hope you don&#39;t mind me answering the more personal ones about us.&quot; <i>Although I would love to know why, when I mentioned your name, they acted like I was dating someone <b>seriously</b> above my social status.</i><br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied Peter, doubting the medical staff of Moon Lake College could know much about the Talbot family.<br />
&quot;In the end, still being a normal at the moment, two was all they would give me, with the standard warning that there was absolutely nothing to prevent me from becoming a were if I had sex with one. If we do go that far, I was told to take the first within an hour before actually having sex with you. The second within 22 to 23 hours of actually becoming a weretigress, and then I&#39;m to come back for a full prescription before another 24 hours passed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds about right,&quot; was all Peter would say, as he felt his cock stirring within his pants, and hoped Karen didn&#39;t notice. <i>You have no idea how badly I WANT you! Especially if those drawings you did of us in the future are accurate.</i><br />
&quot;In the meantime, lunch is on me today because, while I know it&#39;s still early in our courtship, I&#39;m afraid I have a big favor to ask you that has nothing to do with us or these,&quot; said Karen, as she put the pill bottle back in her purse.</p>
