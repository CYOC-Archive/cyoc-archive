<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about we try it out on some of our enemies at school?&quot; Josie asked, thinking about the ways the device could be used to avenge some of the wrongs that had been committed against them. Lakeway High School had a few problems, not the least being the issue of bullying and the impunity some of the bullies had. Josie was already thinking of a few of them, and Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny started, &quot;Let&#39;s try this thing out on, like, Connor Black.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh Connor Black. So called &quot;Connor Blackheart&quot; in and among the more disadvantaged students at the school, Connor was an infamous bully and scoundrel. He partied, he fucked, he shamed those who wouldn&#39;t join him in his bed in person or online, and he faced not a single consequence to his actions from anyone. In part because he was the star, the big, handsome muscular Captain of the Football Team, and in no small part because he sang the rich boy&#39;s song - his parents were wealthy lobbyists and had something like ten homes all over the country.<br />
<br />
Anything happened, a quick &quot;incredibly charitable donation&quot; smoothed it over. Connor had relished in his immunity from consequences for a long time, and there were a lot of stories about the blond scion of wealth. Some said he bullied one nerdy boy so severely the poor guy transferred across the country just to repair his mental state. Others had far more invasive stories of Connor&#39;s behavior.<br />
<br />
In other words, the perfect target for a bit of change via the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Allen Howard?&quot; Josie asked, thinking about the other infamous sportsman to come to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he&#39;s bad,&quot; Jenny said, contemplating, &quot;Not Connor bad, but still---what a d-bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Properly Allen Kouchisaki, Allen went by Howard to try and distance himself from &quot;the stereotype&quot;, as he put it. And indeed, Josie for better or worse could not think of a less stereotypical Asian man. Allen was basically a walking bag of protein powder, creatine, and steroids given life. He dated girls, then he dumped them mostly over text or Instagram message. He would pull some of the meanest pranks out there, and get away with them - mostly because he was somewhat cunning about it.<br />
<br />
His dad ran a local car dealership, and managed the task of making his son seem respectable, so Josie guessed she got where Allen probably got his taste for misbehavior.<br />
<br />
Jenny then said, &quot;Let&#39;s not forget Connor&#39;s horrid harpy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Josie snapped her fingers and leaned forward, &quot;Kendall Keener.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah yes, Kendall Keener. Both Josie and Jenna remembered the nasty, homophobic teasing and bullying that Kendall Keener dispensed, reassured in the knowledge that dalliances came and went, but she and Connor were naturally suited to one another. Beautiful, heartless, cruel and alluring, Kendall was the most common accessory to a lot of Connor&#39;s crimes, and covered for him among other girls. A regular Judas for the girls at school.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should totally change her! Her AND Connor!&quot; Jenna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to be careful though,&quot; Josie started, &quot;We can&#39;t let them cotton on to the fact they&#39;re...different. Otherwise it could make doing this going forward more difficult. Others might...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s make it slow. Make em squirm.&quot; Jenna said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Josie wasn&#39;t sure she was so good about making people SQUIRM, but she was definitely up to correct some behavior that would otherwise go uncorrected. Maybe if they learned their lessons, she could turn them back. Make sure they didn&#39;t do what they did before. Right now, she was actually feeling pretty excited about going in to school tomorrow.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Josie and Jenna went in to school, more boldly than usual. Josie had the Chronivac stored away in her backpack, ready to deploy it if they saw a target. Jenna had brought up they should do it if they see someone doing something bad or otherwise indulging in their habits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girls, wanna go out with me tonight after the gym?&quot; And there was the so called Asian Adonis. Allen, wearing a black tank top, jeans and sneaker shoes, stood by a doorway on the way to class. His hair slicked back with some pomade. Admittedly, Allen was pretty easy on the eyes, but he could do without being so...pushy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Allen, we have things to do.&quot; Jenna said, and kept walking, even as Josie actually contemplated it...before she went along with Jenna. Much as that was kind of skeevy, Allen was not exactly being mean...<br />
<br />
&quot;See you later, big guy.&quot; Josie responded and went along.<br />
<br />
Allen smirked and went inside, he actually thought he had a chance with those two.<br />
<br />
And then Josie saw him. The smile was as always deceptive. They were on their way to first period when they saw Connor. For once without Kendall by his side. The guy was nothing if not BIG. Probably like 230 lbs. His light, almost platinum blond hair was well styled and coiffed, and he wore a letterman over a stringer shirt, and a tight pair of skinny jeans designed to show off his built legs and glutes. Connor was always about a show.<br />
<br />
He was poised right by Lucy Lind, a rather shy girl just trying to get to the library.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucy, cmon, you know you want some of this.&quot; Connor flexed an arm and then grinned, &quot;I&#39;m the most desirable man at the school. I&#39;m built, I&#39;m wealthy, and I&#39;ve got the status to keep me on top.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, I know you&#39;re just filling in a list. You just want to fuck and then---&quot; Lucy was suddenly staring up at him, realizing he was just so much bigger he could probably take what he wanted. She gulped, feeling a pit of fear in her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I wanna fuck, I fuck. That&#39;s the life I lead. You should be grateful I want to expend any effort on you, you gross little nerdy bitch---&quot; Connor outright slapped her books out of her hand, and chuckled outloud as she panicked and tried to pick them up...and only on the last one outright stepped on the book.<br />
<br />
Josie was getting the Chronivac ready. This was just another day for Connor Black, but it was a day when she actually had the Chronivac on hand.<br />
<br />
Jenna decided to make a distraction, and stepped forward, despite knowing that would probably make things complicated for her going forward. She said, &quot;The girl said no, Connor. Why don&#39;t you run off to your class, if you have any beyond &quot;Being A Creep 101.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie was full on hyperventilating as she readied the Chronivac, scanning Connor&#39;s data. She was not prepared for this, no matter how Jenna and her had hyped each other up. Connor was out of control. He was just gonna get worse. How could she---yeah, that&#39;d work. She started punching in data...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t Squealer Jenna.&quot; Connor took his foot off of Lucy&#39;s book and let her grab it and run off. &quot;Drop the high and mighty act. You and I both know if you thought I was so bad, you wouldn&#39;t have come begging for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenna defended herself, &quot;A moment of weakness doesn&#39;t make me any less of a person, bastard---&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie squeaked, &quot;It&#39;s---It&#39;s...I did it...It&#39;s done---I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Kendall was there...and she spoke up, putting an arm around Connor&#39;s big shoulders, &quot;Come on, darling. They&#39;re not worth sharing our bed. Cool down...cool off...&quot; Connor heard the words his girlfriend was saying, and backed off. He breathed visibly, and just walked off quietly with her. Both throwing a middle finger in the air as they did so.<br />
<br />
Jenna almost fell over from the sheer overload of that. She knew Connor was bad, and she knew from personal experience at that. But that was terrible. &quot;Did you---? What did you do to him? How long is it going to take?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie was having doubts Connor even COULD change. He was definitely more than living up to the name &quot;Connor Blackheart&quot;. But she still had faith in it. &quot;It&#39;ll...it&#39;ll take about a week to fully change him. But I...&quot;</p>
