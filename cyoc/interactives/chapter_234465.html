<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe Dean Zurkofsky looked around frantically for any reaction to his change. He expected to teasing, anger, SOMETHING, but the faces around him were mostly just looked relieved to have finished walking and chanting repetitively. Some looked a bit devious and others looked a bit interested, but none looked offended or sympathetic. He really was just a thing to them, it seemed, an experiment in casting a spell over humans. He looked back down at his new arrangement. His sheath was certainly holding his dick much closer to him than his hands had.<br />
<br />
It was at this moment that the many beers that were still in him began to make themselves known, and Joe was rudely reminded that he hadn&#39;t even had the chance to use a restroom before he was carted away out here by cultists insulting his dirty and lazy lifestyle. He&#39;d been holding it in unconsciously this whole time, but his bladder was crying out in imminent defeat from within him. &quot;Oh no, not that, not here,&quot; he said. Some of the curious faces seemed to wonder what he was talking about. He looked for anywhere to turn around but there was no privacy anywhere. He let out a relieved but humiliated &quot;ooooh&quot; as he felt the warm trickle starting. His bladder was leaking its heavy load, and he knew it would appear outside of him any second. But his time, it had much further to go, tickling every inch of his enormous sheathed bull cock. At last he felt it wiggling his fuzzy sheath tip and releasing a ... trickle?<br />
<br />
It was the thinnest, slowest, and highest-pressure stream he could have imagined. It was kind of hard to go through such a long and slender organ! Maybe this was normal for a bull? Joe buried his head in his hands but still flicked his ears at the sound. And then he uncovered his face to sniff the air. His nostrils bulged and widened a bit, and moistened a bit, curious about the smell he was getting. It was strong, virile, like HIM. He looked down at his labored stream with a new sense of meaning. And if he turned into a bull, other bulls and cows would know he smelled like this, and he would know what they smelled like, and he could smell this all the time, and ...<br />
<br />
NO! He shook his head to clear his mind. He did NOT want to know other bovines. He wanted to go back to his house and watch TV and--<br />
<br />
But the master of these apprentices had already noticed. &quot;And you see, the subjects nose has changed, and the urges of his animal body are dominating. Much different than turning a human into an inaminate object--and much more powerful for our coven.<br />
<br />
Joe sighed watching his own stream come to an end. But those huge testicles down there made him feel something as the tingled. That strong scent of his, that masculinity, that he&#39;d never sensed like this before, his sheer size that he wasn&#39;t used to, he began to feel something happen to his tucked away cock.<br />
<br />
And then, in an instant, it wasn&#39;t tucked away anymore! A thin, hot-pink, coiled spike was jutting up out of his long sheath. Why did it look like that?! He flicked his tail around and grabbed it to try and cover up his exposed cockhead with the tassel. But as soon as his manhood sensed nothing was about to happen, the pink poker was gone, back down inside him as quickly as it had appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s really nothing to hide anymore,&quot; said the ritual leader, &quot;you&#39;ll be using those organs in front of us anyway to sire our new cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe heard him and then looked back around at the faces. Those academic, dispassionate, workaday faces. And he knew it was true. He was surrounded by people who saw him as their new bull. And what would Joe Zurkofsky normally do if he was surrounded by women (or men) who really didn&#39;t care what they saw him do in front of him? Well, he might as well do what he&#39;d normally do by himself this time of day, and have a little go of fun with his cock.<br />
<br />
The ugly organ poked out again at his renewed interest. Damn, it doesn&#39;t take him long to get an erection with this thing! And the size of it! Hohoho boy... having something this size and no one to tell him not to use it whenever he pleased was ... kind of a dream come true honestly. He grabbed his stick with both hands, feeling the bony hardness deep inside. He bucked his hips and closed his eyes. His nostrils flared wider, taking in his horny musk. He felt a new surge of fluid forming inside him and snorted for everyone to hear. He came hard, and moaned along with his fast orgasm, which came out as a bellowing &quot;MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; demonstrated the leader. &quot;This one had despised responsibilities and restrictions anyway. Even saving his own humanity is not enough motivation to overcome his animal lusts. Feel his bestial energy radiating in the magical field, giving us back even more energy than we put in, preparing our coven for the next phase and yourselves for your next lesson. But this one is not over yet.&quot;</p>
