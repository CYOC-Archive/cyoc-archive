<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a quick dinner with their mom, Jeff and Mike head out to the mall. &quot;This is so weird...&quot; Mike said as they jumped into his pick up truck. &quot;Christina was my wife... Now she&#39;s my mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded. &quot;Yeah... I think the Chronivac is able to change anything, but does so in the least amount of steps. So instead of making you have a whole new family, it just made you her son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird bro...&quot; Mike said. A smile was still plastered all over his face as the two drove to the mall. He couldn&#39;t get over the changes. Not only was he back in college, but built like a statue. Even as Mike stepped out of his truck, he could already feel all eyes on him. The way his shirt tugged against his massive pecs and how his arms filled his sleeves, had everyone do a double take. A natural strut started to form in his walk as they entered into the mall.<br />
<br />
Jeff followed, having a bit of a difficult time keeping up with the much larger man. The six inch difference between their heights, gave Mike a far longer stride than Jeff. With the amount of coincidence in each step, Jeff was having an even harder time than usual to keep up. Though, he couldn&#39;t help but feel as though he loved the difference. Consciously Jeff knew it was because of the Chronivac, emotionally he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this can change anything?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
It took Jeff a second to realize that Mike had said something. &quot;Oh! Yeah. I think so. Any ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm....&quot; Mike scanned the area. So many people were sneaking glances, if not outright gawking at him. &quot;You think you can make it so girls would want to fuck me whenever I wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
A pang of jealousy shot though Jeff. He fought his own desire down. &quot;I think you can already do that now...&quot; Jeff nodded over to a table of girls in the food court staring openly at his big brother. Their eyes looked him up and down. &quot;It looks like you even get to have your pick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think?&quot; Mike flexed his bicep and watched their eyes go wild. A cocky grin appeared on his face. &quot;If anything goes wrong, use that device to get me out of it. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do,&quot; Jeff said. However, as Mike was approaching the girls at the table, he had a different idea. &#39;Woman find Mike irresistibly attractive. However, they never approach him. Instead, whenever he approaches a woman, they find it near impossible to tell him no and excitedly do whatever he wants. Even going so far as to know before he even says anything. When he finishes, if they get any cum on them at all, they turn into an incredibly masculine man for at least 72 hours. No one finds the change strange or unnatural and most like it.&#39; Of course Jeff made sure to make Mike unaware of the change.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mike had pointed at a pretty blond and threw a thumb over his shoulder. She instantly knew what that meant and pushed her way out of the booth. The other girls who weren&#39;t chosen looked pissed, but didn&#39;t say anything. The blond got up and went underneath Mike&#39;s arm. They headed to the men&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
The girl was already all over Mike when they entered. She didn&#39;t even care if there was anyone else in there. Raising up on her tiptoes, she kissed Mike. Her arms draped around Mike&#39;s broad shoulders, helping hold her up. She pushed Mike towards one of the stalls and then lowered his shorts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your quick,&quot; Mike teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what I like,&quot; the girl responded. Her nails gently scraped down Mike&#39;s muscular torso as she dropped down to her knees. Mike&#39;s cock was already hard. &quot;Even big down here!&quot; the girl&#39;s eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m big all over, babe,&quot; Mike flexed his arm and his cock bounced with excitement. &quot;But, just so you--&quot; her lips were already around Mike&#39;s dick before he was able to explain anything. &quot;Shit...&quot; he breathed as he felt the softness of her lips engulf his cock. The girl was an expert as she pulled back and forth. Her tongue knew exactly how to wrap around and hit all the most sensitive parts of his member. Mike was already struggling. He gripped the stall walls and thought he heard something crack. &quot;Oh fuck...&quot; he moaned and accidently finished inside the woman&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
She swallowed it. Mike stared at her in shock. &quot;Did you just...&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled proudly, stood up and placed her hand and head against Mike&#39;s pecs. &quot;There&#39;s more where--&quot; she let out a grunt. Her entire body shook. &quot;What the--?&quot; A burp escaped out of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... You swallowed my cum...&quot; Mike said. &quot;I was going to tell you that if you got any on you, you&#39;d turn into a man, and then you go and swallow it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait-- What--?&quot; She grunts again. Her painted nails dig into Mike&#39;s chest. The bright blue color instantly disappears as her nails trim down close to her fingers. A little bit of dirt starts to form underneath them. &quot;Oh fuck...&quot; she groans. The chirper high pitched voice she had drones out into a deep commanding bass. Her entire body bucks again. She clenches onto Mike for support.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll only last a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
The changes start with her fingers and toes. They grow far larger and broader than they had been. Patches of hair grow on the back of her fingers and hand. Rough callouses form around the palm. The dark blond hair starts running up her forearms. Muscle quickly adds onto her slender frame. It&#39;s strong and powerful. Mike can actually feel her squeeze. &quot;Aww fuck bro...&quot; Even the cadence of her voice changes from a preppy girl into a strong jock. &quot;This is so fuckin&#39; weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know...&quot; Mike rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
The soft angles of her face began to straighten out. Her jaw grew wider. Coarse, blond hair began to grow out of it. Her eyes narrowed and brow pushed forward. The thin, trimmed eyebrows grew thick and bushy.<br />
<br />
Her bones cracked and stretched bringing her closer to Mike&#39;s height. Muscle continued to add onto her body. Big biceps formed around her arms. The fatty tissue in her breast quickly receded but then pushed back out with hard muscle. Her shoulders widened and hips thinned out, giving her an inverted triangle shape to her torso.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she gripped Mike incredibly tightly. &quot;Oh fuck bro! GOD DAMN IT!&quot; he yelled loudly as he felt his balls fall out of his vagina. A rod was quickly to follow and engorge itself. &quot;God damn...&quot; He breathed. &quot;That was fucking weird as hell.&quot; Without thinking, he was already touching himself. Blood quickly went to the member and made it even larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I know...&quot; Mike looked down at the man. He was a jacked 215 at about 6&#39;1&quot;. &quot;It always is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not bad. You know?&quot; the newly formed man flexed his arm, feeling the power inside of it. He continued exploring the size and strength of his body, not realizing the little bit of space in the stall had just lost a lot more. &quot;Maybe after this we can go out?&quot; he offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry man... I don&#39;t date dudes. And since you swallowed my cum, it&#39;ll probably be about a month before you change back,&quot; Mike explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... Really?&quot; the man whined. He was still running his hands over his massive body, not even realizing that his clothes had changed as well. The tank top and short shorts had changed into a sweat stained wife beater and his shorts were down to his knees. &quot;I was hoping we could go out for drinks or something, but I guess I&#39;ll just have to do it with my friends.&quot; He shrugged his heavy shoulders and went to the bathroom sinks. He washed his hands off, took a drink out of the sink, and then tied his long blond hair up into a man bun. He gave himself one more flex, watching the hard muscle flex. &quot;Yeah... I&#39;ll have a bunch of fun with my friends...&quot; he bragged.<br />
<br />
Mike rolled his eyes. He headed out of the bathroom and back over to Jeff. Jeff watched in awe as he saw another man exit where the woman had entered. &#39;It worked...&#39; he smiled. &quot;How was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad...&quot; Mike shrugged. &quot;But she turned into a man again... Maybe we can use the device to make that stop happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jeff said.</p>
