<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joel wrapped a towel around Jess as his clothes came off. It had to be one of the beach ones because it had a lot of real estate to cover. Meekly, Jess apologized for no reason that Joel could understand. <br />
<br />
It was just the two of them, although Fiona hopped sideways a few times and made sure they were all right. Alyssa was the last to leave the jetty after Duncan retreated over to the tents. Barry looked nervous but Fiona lingered around. <br />
<br />
Joel despised the skintight pants she was wedged into because when wet they felt like paint spread over her skinny ass and irritated labia. Just being in damp shorts before was an ordeal. At the same time, she didn’t feel like shedding them with the Jaw of Life to get something else on until they dried somewhat. <br />
<br />
Jessica was fortunate that Joel otherwise liked to go bulky and stretchy. His spandex pants sufficed. The problem was when she looked down at Jess’s crotch and couldn’t get the idea out of her head that this brand new man was trying to sneak a freaking half link of kielbasa out of a meat market on top of some hairy buns. That wasn’t so much a problem as an introduction of so many feelings into Joel all at once. <br />
<br />
Even with the pants on, she couldn’t get the impression out of her head of the anonymous lump hiding all that. Jess seemed to notice her attention and quipped with some of her regular tone but a much deeper timber, “See something you like?”<br />
<br />
Joel worked on finding a top for Jess even though it wasn’t the most imminent concern. She snuck quick looks at his enormous pecs. Eventually, they went with a windbreaker not too dissimilar from what Barry had on earlier. As Joel turned to go back to the group, Jess caught her insubstantial, richly-tanned arm and guided her back to face him. The new man had the same manly aroma as Duncan but way more concentrated and mixed with the lingering traces of her old body from those clothes. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry”, Jess said, gazing down at her. Joel shrugged and sighed. “What for? Wasn’t your fault. I’m just glad you didn’t get hurt. I’ll always pull you to shore, no matter what weak-ass muscles I’m saddled with.” Joel found herself colliding with a warble in her voice as though she were about to cry. Fucking goddamn stupid estrogen flooding things, she ranted internally. <br />
<br />
Jess pulled her close with her broad arms and rigidly firm body. Immersed in that heady, confusing, and alluring aroma, Joel released a long breath and told him, “I’m sorry too, but absolutely should be. Boys are tempting and smell so fucking good.”<br />
<br />
It made Joel feel so diminutive to be held by a big, strong man who used to be her cute girlfriend. Such a girl thing to do. But he was a girl now and probably from now on and whatever ego left in tatters from his manly self didn’t matter. She just wanted to be held. Beneath the clammy, aching cold of her drying tight pants, it felt like the space between her legs wanted to light her entire soul on fire. She got herself a towel that almost felt like too much for her, even though it wasn’t even the biggest one they had.<br />
<br />
Jess whispered that it was okay and they walked back over to the tents. They had split into obvious groups with Duncan on the far side he seem to favor and Alyssa a cautious, conscious distance away. Barry lightly meandered on the side towards the car with Fiona sitting next to her. Jess and Joel sat the furthest away by the tent that Joel had put together. It was painfully awkward. <br />
<br />
From his bag, Jess had extracted a set of glasses wipes to fix up his lenses. He grumbled faintly that so long as this spirit curse, or whatever it was, turned her into a ripped and rugged man, then the least it could also do was patch up her astigmatism. Meanwhile, Joel glanced around the circle and saw everyone moping, with just Fiona showing any sort of enthusiasm playing what looked like hambone on her legs. She was strange but at least better than Alyssa. <br />
<br />
Hopping up, Joel made a fire pit in the center of camp with stones and logs. Jess helped her with taking some folding chairs out of the car as well as finding a few sitting logs. They had moss and bugs but were better than nothing. After setting everything up, Joel eyed the lake and instead opted to go find a separate stream for water. However, they really had no way to test it. Fortunately, the water they brought with them was sufficient to cook up a crude meal. <br />
<br />
Duncan fretted for a minute about people watching the lake site and whether they could see their fire. Barry’s concerns about being observed by the government popped up again, but Joel noted that if they wanted to find them here then they left plenty of signs already. Better to have something they could dry their clothes on and cook with. At which point, Joel stripped… or rather dragged, squirmed, wrenched, and fought her way out of the less wet pants and managed to kick them off. <br />
<br />
She also displayed and folded her top for Alyssa before resting them beside the heat of the fire. Jess got quiet as Joel strutted naked over to the car to pick out a loose tank top and one of Jess’s favorite knee length skirts. Never in a million years did Joel imagine he would be choosing to wear one of his girlfriend’s skirts, but it was admittedly far more comfortable than the jeans. She could’ve poked through the underwear options but considering how small and skinny she was, she expected it would be uncomfortable, bunched up, and barely on anyway. <br />
<br />
With the fire crackling, she settled on the log next to Jess and bumped shoulders. Jess bumped her back and slipped that big beefy arm around her slight form. She submitted to it with a certain ticklishness sinking through her body. Here she was the cute girlfriend sitting with her boyfriend. That role chafed at her. She was supposed to be the protector. What did that make her now? Thinking about it twisted and contorted her thoughts in a dozen different directions.<br />
<br />
Would she be like a princess, with a delicate, flowing white dress to contrast her vivid skin tone? Perhaps she had a destiny building up her muscles again with tae bo, wall climbing, and vigorous swimming. Become an adventure girl like the ones in Duncan‘s video games. She would have to train Jess, if she wanted to keep the bulk of her spirit granted muscles. They sometimes worked out, but Jess felt far more comfortable curled up with a book than curling weights. <br />
<br />
Might she become the bookish one if this fresh hormone infusion meant something to her neurons? She had no idea. At least figuring it out with Jess sounded like a nic prospect. Alyssa remained off by herself while still ostensibly in camp. Duncan was likewise isolated, but Joel knew that was a comfortable position for him. <br />
<br />
Barry looked better, although still dumbstruck by her new body. Fiona made a series of hand gestures when she was finished with the percussion. She appeared to have a comfortable rapport with Barry. Then, suddenly, during a lull in all the conversations, Fiona got her feet, dusted off her hands, and simply declared, “ Well! I suppose it’s my turn. No need to put it off.”<br />
<br />
Without preamble, she got up and started walking to the shoreline. Barry was the first to put it together and called over to her with concern. Fiona paused and pivoted on her legs. She grabbed her chin for a moment and remarked, “Nude would be better. No ruined clothes. Miss Watson? Could you please find me my green towel in my bag and bring it over? <br />
<br />
Barry, whose last name was Watson, swiveled her head between Fiona‘s calm countenance and the questioning group. Next, Fiona slowly unbuttoned her blouse as she walked to the jetty. She folded the garment casually and then unstrapped her bra. “Anyone have use for a 28B? Might have to wait and see on that.“ Her jeans and underwear went down next, along with a cute pair of pink socks.<br />
<br />
Fiona playfully whistled while in the buff and making a neat pile of her clothes. Barry appeared the most unsettled and nervously approached her. She beamed a bright smile at Barry and gave a quick, lean-in hug with her arm wrapped around her neck before whispering something private. That settled, Fiona frolicked to the end of the jetty and scanned the water. <br />
<br />
Turning back, she looked to Joel and asked if there was any part she should aim for. Joel shrugged and just told her to keep her arms close and point with her feet. She posed as instructed, took a few steps back, cried out, “YOLO!!”, and leapt from the end of the planks. <br />
<br />
She got full immersion with a significant splash. Alyssa panted out a ragged breath as she watched. Duncan brushed back his wild hair. And Barry cupped the top of her head with her hands. Joel had to wonder what Barry and Fiona had been talking about but she was glad at least someone in the group had gone into the water voluntarily. She had no idea if that meant anything to the results but observed with interest. <br />
<br />
Almost a full minute later, a figure breached the water and grabbed onto the planks to hoist themselves back onto the jetty. Even from this distance, she could tell that Fiona did not get the short end of the stick. The man pulling himself up had long, golden locks like a classical hero. Unlike Jess, he wasn’t ripped everywhere. He definitely had taut, tight, pronounced muscles and a stomach greater than a six pack. His features didn’t push towards the rugged but rather retained a certain boyish softness. He giggled and shook the water from his beautiful body. <br />
<br />
Barry hesitated, but eventually made it over to him with the towel requested. After covering up, the new man smiled at Barry and gently kissed her on the forehead. After a blushing instant, Barry returned the favor before dipping her head and leading him back onto land. <br />
<br />
Joel glanced over at Duncan and Alyssa. She had to wonder, how long would it be before those two also got in on the action?</p>
