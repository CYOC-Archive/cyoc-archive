<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I walked down the hallway towards the stairs to head back towards the construction site, one of the doors beside me opened. I turned to see my neighbor, Mr. James Nicholson, walking out. He was a larger man, muscular with a beer gut, and had a bushy salt-and-pepper beard that complimented his face nicely. He was the football coach for the local high school, and as such he used to wear tight polo shirts and khakis often, but right now he instead wore a thick turtleneck sweater that concealed the muscular dad bod I knew he had. He turned to me and smiled. <br />
“Oh, Jason, glad I caught you!” He approached me, closing the door behind him, and as soon as he reached me, he placed his hands around my waist, immediately beginning to feel up my abs and obliques. I instantly felt like pure ecstasy. “I was hoping you could do me a favor?” After saying that, he leaned in and placed his mouth on my neck, kissing the exposed muscles between my neck and shoulders and tickling the skin with his beard.<br />
“O-oh? What is it?” I subconsciously began to flex my abs, giving his rough hands more to explore at my midsection, and lifted an arm into a bicep pose. My mind was filled with lustful feelings, not really for James, but for wha he was doing. I felt my dick begin to get hard and strain in my shorts.<br />
James pulled back from my neck to speak. “It’s for my son. We recently found out that he’s gay, and his muscles are starting to come in.” He paused to push his face into my armpit, taking a deep whiff before pulling back and resuming his request. “He’s feeling shy about his body still, and doesn’t feel comfortable having me take him clothes shopping for his expanding body. I was hoping you could-“ He interrupted himself mid sentence and took another whiff of my armpit as his hands migrated forward, using his thumbs to trace around my abs while his fingers explored the muscles at my sides, massaging them into complete blissful submission.<br />
“I was hoping you could take him to one of those gay clubs where he can feel a bit better about things, then take him shopping? I’d pay for everything of course, hell you could buy a couple things for yourself while you’re at it.” Once he was done, me brought his face to my flexing arm, and began slowly running his tongue up and down the veins on my arm, and I felt my dick begin to leak precum as he did. I was obsessed with the feelings of worship I was receiving, though it oddly enough didn’t distract from the conversation.<br />
“You mean Sean, right? I’ve noticed he’s gotten bigger lately.” I hadn’t actually, but I guess it was how my mind was adjusting to fit in to the new way the world worked. “Yeah, how does tomorrow sound?”<br />
He finished another stroke down the vein on my arm before pulling back and speaking. “Let me go ask.” He began to step away, but I walked with him, causing him to return one of his hands to my back, feeling at the muscles that ran by my spine. He opened the door to his apartment with his free hand, and shouted inside. “Hey Sean, could you come out here please?” <br />
I heard Sean yell back from inside, and while we waited for his arrival, James began position himself behind me and kneel, as he began to tickle the small of my back with kisses. A moment passed and at the doorway was a Sean, almost the same skinny red-headed teenager, wearing a long-sleeved shirt that was probably his dads, but even still you could tell that the shirt was almost filled around his arms, and oversized sweatpants that could only hide developing muscles and a oversized cock. Once he spotted he, he quickly rushed over and I instinctively grabbed him, pulling him into a loose chokehold, where Sean instantly began tracing the muscles of my arms with his hands and cheeks.<br />
“What’s up dad?” Sean asked, beginning to caress the pit of my elbow with his tongue as soon as he stopped talking. <br />
“You’re free tomorrow right? Mr. Gray here wants to take you out to a club and to go clothes shopping, get you used to the gay community.” James’ hands wrapped around my exposed calves and he stuck his head between my legs in the process. I instinctively stepped to close his head between my thighs and smirked as I heard him let out a moan. I felt his head tap against my dick as he wiggled around, enjoying the experience.<br />
Sean’s head turned in my arm as he began migrating around to look at me, sloppily kissing my bicep in the process. “Are you sure *kiss* that’s okay *kiss* Mr. Gray? *kiss* I don’t want to be a bother.” He had completely turned at this point, his face buried in my pecs.<br />
I gave him a kind smile. “Absolutely, it’s my pleasure.” I squeezed my pecs, crushing his face, and Sean moaned loudly. I then felt his tongue begin to lap up the sweat that had begun to pool under my pecs, where skin had exposed from my crop top riding upwards again. As he did so, I felt myself cum in my shorts. <br />
“I’ll- I’ll see you tomorrow at 10 sharp, okay?” Sean nodded into my chest and I released my grip, slowing Sean to head back into his apartment. I also released my grip on James’s head and he stood up, kissing my neck once more. “Thank you, I’ll be sure to send him with my credit card. I really appreciate this!” And with that, James walked back into his apartment, sporting a spot of my cum on the back of his head.</p>
