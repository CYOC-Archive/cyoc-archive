<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, this is where you guys have been...  What&#39;s the term?  Broing out?&quot;  Rani stands atop the ridge with the rest of you, overlooking the beautiful emerald lake, surrounded by mountains and cliff sides.  She slowly takes in the awe-inspiring view.  &quot;I kinda wish I&#39;d brought my paints with me.  This place is gorgeous!&quot;<br />
<br />
George chuckles, the action causing his soft body to quiver.  &quot;Well, you can&#39;t go swimming from back here.  Last one down&#39;s a rotten egg!&quot;  The middle-aged mountain man begins picking his way down the rocky trail with surprising speed.<br />
<br />
Not to be outdone, you find yourself racing down behind him, wincing as the gut you&#39;d been building for the past few weeks jiggles harshly with your movements.<br />
<br />
You hear Colby call out from behind the two of you.  &quot;Be careful!&quot;<br />
<br />
As you make your way down to the beach, George has already slipped his billowing shirt off, revealing his round, blobby torso in all its hirsute splendor.  You do the same, revealing your own chubby, hairy body.  All that extra food was definitely showing on your frame.<br />
<br />
You and George both stop on the beach to strip off your pants.  You decide, however, to keep your boxers on, as there&#39;s a young woman in your presence.  You manage to pull your jeans off first and run along the dock, jumping off into the water.  You resurface in time to see the massive form of George come hurtling down the dock straight for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look out below!&quot;<br />
<br />
His wide body impacts the surface of the lake, sending a plume of water high up into the air.  He resurfaces, his beard a watery mess and his face flushed with exertion.  Though, he still has a wide grin on his face.  &quot;I forgot just how fun it is to be my dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not long later, Rani and Colby join you on the beach.  Rani lays out a towel she had brought along, as well as a cooler full of food.  Colby sets to work lighting a fire in the fire pit.  You and George pull yourselves out of the water and back onto the beach.  You&#39;re a little embarrassed, as your boxers, which had become fairly tight to begin with, are now soaked.  Luckily, Rani had the foresight to bring extra towels, so you wrap one around your waist to avoid any accidental exposure.<br />
<br />
Rani grins at the two of you as you drip lake water onto the sand.  &quot;I&#39;ll admit, you guys run pretty good for a couple of old, fat dudes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You frown.  &quot;Who&#39;re you calling old?  I may look a little older, but this body&#39;s only 40.&quot;<br />
<br />
She takes a sip from her soda, looking you up and down.  &quot;Just how old are you, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
You root around in the cooler before finding a beer.  &quot;I just told you.  I&#39;m 40.&quot;<br />
<br />
She purses her lips, annoyed.  &quot;Yeah, no, I got that bit.  I meant the real you.  That body&#39;s 40, but how old are you really?&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause, beer can hovering just below your lips.  You certainly couldn&#39;t tell her that you were actually a 15 year old on an unsanctioned vacation from his family.  She would... well, you had no idea what she would do, but it wouldn&#39;t be good.<br />
<br />
Instead, you shrug.  &quot;Does it really matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
She raises an eyebrow.  She looks as though she&#39;s analyzing you for a moment.  She then turns her attention back to her soda.  &quot;No, I suppose not.&quot;  There&#39;s a short lull in the conversation.  She then turns to you and asks &quot;So, Colby&#39;s in the form of George&#39;s uncle, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
You choke a bit on your beer.  After your done coughing, you look back over at her.  &quot;How did you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smirks and rolls her eyes.  &quot;Well, George is in the form of his dad, and he&#39;s suddenly started calling Colby &#39;bro&#39; and &#39;brother&#39; a lot.  Seeing as the socks tend to alter personality traits and George has yet to call you any of those things, I can infer that Colby is most likely in the form of George&#39;s uncle, who owns this cabin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Impressed, you nod.  &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s just about right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her smirk disappears and her expression is suddenly more serious.  &quot;So, seeing as you&#39;re out here at his uncle&#39;s cabin, and his uncle isn&#39;t, just where is he?  Where&#39;s George&#39;s uncle?  I mean, from what I&#39;d heard, this place had been sitting here abandoned for at least a couple of years, if not longer.  I mean, you did a nice job fixing those boats and the dock up, but they&#39;ve been sitting here a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s another moment of silence as you turn the beer can over in your hands.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  George hasn&#39;t heard from him in a long time, either.  I think they&#39;re worried, but George said that he would just go off and disappear sometimes.  So this isn&#39;t too unusual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani sighs.  &quot;Well, if you&#39;re not worried...&quot;<br />
<br />
A sharp whistle cuts the afternoon air.  You both turn to see Colby and a slightly singed George standing next to a roaring campfire.  George starts waving for the two of you to come over.  &quot;Fire&#39;s ready!  Let&#39;s eat!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The four of you have a traditional campfire dinner of hot dogs and s&#39;mores.  At George&#39;s behest, you manage to eat an entire package of hot dogs on your own.  Colby merely shakes his head as you snarf down eight of the dogs, buns and all.  Rani finds the whole thing very amusing.  You finish off your meal with at least four s&#39;mores, indulging in your father&#39;s sweet tooth.<br />
<br />
Soon, the sun starts to dip low in the horizon, setting the sky above the emerald lake ablaze into a show of oranges, pinks, and reds.  The stars begin to come out, like tiny holes pin-pricked into the sheet of the sky.  The air is abuzz with the droning of frogs, insects, and the crackling of your fire&#39;s dying embers.<br />
<br />
Colby and Rani push one of the repaired boats out onto the lake.  They paddle about as you and George stay behind, on your backs, half naked, looking up at the darkening sky.<br />
<br />
George scratches his hairy face with an equally hairy hand.  &quot;Not long now, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
You glance over at your hirsute friend.  &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until we go home, I mean.  We can&#39;t stay up here forever, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sigh and scratch at your hairy gut.  You’re kind of proud of the round shape on your torso.  Sure, you dad had started with a beginner&#39;s gut, but you really got it going.  The best part was it was all temporary.  In a few weeks, you would be turning back into yourself again and be at home.  &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
George nods.  &quot;As much as I like hanging out up here, though, I kinda miss home.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug.  &quot;Yeah, I guess.  It would be nice to see my dad again.  I mean, having his body is one thing, but I really like hanging out with him, you know?  George?&quot;<br />
<br />
But George isn&#39;t watching you.  He&#39;s propped himself up and is looking across the lake.  You do the same and try to catch a glimpse of what has him so interested.<br />
<br />
Then you see it.  &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned.&quot;<br />
<br />
George grins and chuckles.  &quot;Well, hell, if we had bet on this I&#39;d be winning right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair of you watch the boat carrying Colby and Rani on the far side of the lake.  They were fairly far away, and you eyesight wasn&#39;t what it used to be, but there was no mistaking it.  The pair was leaning into each other, their lips locked in a kiss.<br />
<br />
You sigh and shake your head.  George nudges you with a large, furry arm.  &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug.  &quot;It&#39;s like you said, George.  We can&#39;t stay here forever.&quot;</p>
