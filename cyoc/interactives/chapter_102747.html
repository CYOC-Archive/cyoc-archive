<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Betty was so preoccupied with trying to find the shop that she didn&#39;t notice Harry take the dice from her pocket. She only realised it when they were tossed across the floor and a golden -0.2 appeared. She panicked not knowing what would happen. <br />
There was a flash of light and Harry had dissipeared from the stroller. Horrified that he had deaged into noting she looked around.<br />
Then she felt an intense pain in her stomach. Slowly it began to grow and bulge outwards. It kept growing as she fell to the ground in pain and only stopped when it reached that of a 2 month pregnant belly.<br />
She rubbed her now large stomach and sighed thankful he hadn&#39;t died atleast. With some difficulty she stood up and continued her search.<br />
After what felt like hours she finaly found it.<br />
It was a small black shop with a little red roof in the very back ally. It didn&#39;t look like much apart from its glowing gold sign that read &#39;spells r us&#39; <br />
She smiled in relief as she waddled over to the door and entered the shop.<br />
A man stood behind the counter, he was about 40 with a black mustace and thick head of hair. His green eyes followed her from the door way as she walked through the packed shop full of everything you can imagine<br />
&quot;Hello mum is there something I can help you with?&quot; He asked noticing her looking a bit lost<br />
&quot;Yes actually, my friend bought these from here earlier and well... Let&#39;s just say we need a way to reverse the effects&quot; she held out the dice to him and his eyes widened only just taking in her pregnant belly and baby in pram.<br />
&quot;Ah...well I would love to help but&quot;<br />
&quot;But!&quot;<br />
&quot;But you see these dice weren&#39;t bought, they were never on sale and were stolen yesterday. So your not covered by our reversal policy even if they weren&#39;t irriverable.&quot; He shrugged not seeming too sorry<br />
&quot;But you can&#39;t leave us like this, she can&#39;t spend the rest of her life a baby or me pregnant!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry you won&#39;t, you see there is a new life loop hole, if the person is reborn then they are Abel to grow again.&quot;<br />
Betty stared at him horrified as a idea came to mind. She took the dice and made Meg throw them.<br />
Again a golden -0.2 appeared and Meg was gone leaving Betty to expand slightly as she became pregnant with twins. <br />
Her tight fitting top was strech ing beyond its max and was ripping at the seems. Without thinking twice she rolled the dice and prayed she would only gain 9 months. However this isn&#39;t what happened.<br />
A golden 40 appeared and she leaned forwards as the baby&#39;s inside her aged along with her. It all happened so fast. One minuet she is in labour the next two ten year pulls were passed out on the floor beneath her completely naked. Her breasts sagged slightly and more grey hairs filled her hair and crows feet appeared by her eyes. She felt tired and old.<br />
&quot;Oh dear what a lot to go through in such a short time&quot; the man smiled as two men came and took the children away in blankets to have their minds whipped and be relocated.<br />
&quot;But I can fix that you know. You are or were very beautiful&quot; <br />
She looked at him curiously as he handed her a pendent with a number 21 carved into it. She put it on and instantly she felt her skin becoming tighter , her boobs and ass less saggy and her hair shiney and solid black. <br />
She ran a hand across her restored body and smiled at how she looked. &quot;I don&#39;t understand&quot;<br />
The man smirked at her &quot;you belong to me now, see I&#39;ve been meaning to get some entertainment for the men In The back room and your perfect.&quot; He reached across the counter and squeezed her breasts making them become bigger to an f cup<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t!&quot; She yelled turning to run away.<br />
The man simply snapped his fingers and she froze, her clothes melted off her leaving her completely naked in to store, he nodded as he inspected her prodding her in every place. &quot;Some changes need to be made, first off&quot; he snapped his fingers and her skin colour became darker more tanned to the colour of milk chocolate. Then he streched out her hips and ass making them even bigger before making her 6ft 1. Her dark hair grew longer until it almost touched the floor and curled slightly handing in ringlets over her nipples.<br />
&quot;Now for clothes.&quot; Two golden peirceings appeared in her nipples attacked to see through purple material that hung low attaching itself to a thong that was little more then a few strings. Gold bracelets appeared on her ancle she and up her arms.<br />
Finally he snapped his finger releasing her.<br />
&quot;What did you do to-&quot;<br />
He snapped his fingers one more time &quot;you are now Jewel, you live only to pleasure your customers. You are twenty one years old and do everything your boss commands&quot;<br />
Jewel blinked I suprise unsure why she was in the shop front when customers were waiting.<br />
 She ran to a back door and opened it.<br />
Several older man sat waiting. She put on her her long toned legs up over ones chair and pressed her breasts into his face &quot;hope I didn&#39;t keep you boys waiting long, now tell me how Jewel can make your naughty little desires come true&quot;</p>
