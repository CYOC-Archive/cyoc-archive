<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer lay in a writhing and moaning pile of flesh, a slave to the thoughts and feelings that were holding her captive. As she frantically slurped her nipples, her brother&#39;s voice echoed down the hallway, &quot;Jen? Are you ok?&quot; and Jen&#39;s eyes darted to the doorway. Ernest walked in, whose eyes grew wide for a moment before he put his palm to his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t even stay awake an hour? I knew something was up when you didn&#39;t bug me after a few minutes. I just thought you were distracted with the game, so I could take a little more time to recharge...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer barely processed the information, &quot;I don&#39;t care. Just fuck me! Now!&quot; She buried her fist in her sopping crevice. <br />
<br />
Ernest looked at Jennifer with a little bit of pity, &quot;Not yet Sis, unless you wanna make it worse, remember? We gotta do things carefully or we won&#39;t be able to reverse this without special treatment.&quot; Jennifer paused for a moment and wondered briefly what special treatment was. She hoped it involved dicks. Lots of dicks. Maybe some tits? She giggled as she went back  to business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you upstairs so you&#39;ll be rested for school tomorrow afterwards. Then I&#39;ll make a few quick phone calls so you can get this under control.&quot; School was the last thought on her mind. She didn&#39;t realize that no matter how hard she stimulated her body, she wouldn&#39;t be able to climax. Her movements were only serving to increase her horniness and the intensity with which she was trying to bring about her orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Sis, you&#39;re gonna have some trouble getting upstairs, so let&#39;s work together to get your boobs up the stairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only thing that reached Jen&#39;s world was that her brother--a man--was going to grab her breasts. She looked at him hungrily, &quot;You can do a lot more than that to me silly!&quot; He shook his head, &quot;Not yet, remember? Now, let&#39;s get those things upstairs.<br />
<br />
Ernest walked over to the front of Jen, his dick eye-level with her elevated point of view. She tried to pull herself forward and made an attempt to lick his dick through his pants, but he wasn&#39;t close enough, &quot;Geeze, give it a little! Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll get plenty of dick if you just go upstairs like a good girl and wait for it. More than one if you cooperate!&quot; She quickly weighed her options. She could try to have one dick now--and judging by her brother&#39;s reaction he wasn&#39;t going to give it up easy--or she could be patient and get multiple dicks soon. &#39;It&#39;s practically a win-win!&#39; she thought to herself. &quot;Ok, I guess I can wait for a little Ernie, but you better not be lying to me!&quot; she admonished him. He winked, &quot;Why would I lie about something like that? Trust me, you&#39;ll be happy after we get you upstairs and I make a few phone calls.&quot;<br />
<br />
They worked together to get Jennifer&#39;s massive mammaries up their stairs. Every step made Jennifer want to collapse in a puddle of tits again, but she steeled her resolve. &#39;It&#39;s for the dicks.&#39; she mentally encouraged herself. And with a few brief pauses where Jennifer had to &quot;scratch an itch&quot; (flick her bean), they made it to her room. She flopped forward into her bed as Ernest left the room to make some calls. As she resumed her entertainment, she thought about alternate ways she could fulfill her needs until whatever Ernest did whatever he had been blabbering about. She idly looked into her closet, and saw her massive collection of dildos where clothes normally would be. <br />
<br />
In her mind, she had visceral memories of each and every one of the toys and its specific applications. However, she was in no state to make it to her closet. So she fished her hand around under her bed until she felt a plastic bin. Drawing it out and placing it in front of her, she began to take an endless number of dildos and vibrators out, briefly playing with each before throwing it at her closet, some of the vibrators still buzzing.<br />
<br />
A few minutes of relentless self-teasing later and Ernest returned, accompanied by Anya, Hannah, and Barry. Anya and Hannah barely resembled the goddesses they appeared to be before, and were in similar (though exponentially more controlled) states as Jennifer. The scraps of cloth that were hardly covering their ample assets could hardly be called &quot;clothes&quot; and it was clear that they were dripping with each step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you weren&#39;t kidding Ern! I&#39;ve never seen anyone that bad in real life before.&quot; Barry proclaimed. Ernest nodded, &quot;Yeah, thankfully I think she only took a nap for an hour. You should have seen that one time she slept a whole night. Practically took half the block to reset her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was still lost in her tub of toys. uselessly fucking herself and discarding the toy like it was used garbage. Jennifer perked up as they all approached her and began disrobing. &quot;Yay! Big bro isn&#39;t a liar! You got me exactly what I wanted! Is it my birthday or something?&quot; she looked at him with a serious expression on her face, trying to seriously remember if it was--in fact--her birthday. &quot;No Sis, we just gotta finish your day, ok? Just remember what happened this time so it doesn&#39;t happen tomorrow.&quot; Jennifer nodded sheepishly, briefly ignoring her tender and wanting cunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now Anya and Hannah, you&#39;re on boob duty. Barry, you&#39;re on mouth, and I&#39;ll get her puss. Jen, you make sure to give everyone your all, ok?&quot; Jennifer nodded enthusiastically as they flipped her on her back, legs dangling off the foot of the bed. She tossed the nearly empty bin of toys toward the closet, and let her party get to work.<br />
<br />
Anya and Hannah got started, simultaneously suckling her protruding nipples. Jennifer didn&#39;t feel like it was fair to them that she get all the pleasure, so she started massaging their dripping snatches instead of her own. Jen immediately noticed the difference, as the intensity and technique increased with each waggle of her fingers.<br />
<br />
But she had little attention to pay to the ladies&#39; techniques, as Barry approached her with his cock in hand, which Jennifer eyed thirstily. She licked her lips before wrapping them around the head of his sizable member. As she began rocking her head back and forth, she felt Ernest slide into her hallway. It triggered the feeling that she had been trying to emulate since her after-entertainment shower earlier. Her brain exploded in waves of pleasure, as she became one with the moment. Fingers deep in the cunts of two other sex-crazed nymphs, speared through on both ends from dicks. She came a thousand times, colors playing across her vision before she fell into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
She woke up in a pile of breasts, though they were not the over-inflated mass that they had been the last time Jen was conscious. &quot;God, I really gotta remember to finish things off before they get that far. Even if it was a little fun...&quot; she thought to herself, realizing that it was still the middle of the night. Her load was gone, her breasts returned to their original C-cup status. As she flipped through the photos on her phone, she saw the ones that had been taken when they pantsed Kyle. A memory briefly skittered across her mind. She realized why her day felt so weird. Then remembered all the things she had done over the day. Her eyes grew wide as she started waking up the sisters. Both of the men had long gone, deciding to leave the women to clean themselves up when they woke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girls, wake up, something weird&#39;s been going on.&quot; they stirred awake, &quot;Yeah, you let yourself go a little too far yesterday. Don&#39;t worry though, we had fun...&quot; Anya&#39;s voice trailed off as she fumbled for her phone in her average clothing that was strewn about the floor. &quot;No, you don&#39;t get it! There was...&quot; Jennifer&#39;s voice trailed off, she felt a tingle travel across her body, but wrote it off as the chill of the cold room on her nude body, &quot;something weird at school...I just don&#39;t remember what now. What was I just thinking about again?&quot; Anya looked at her sympathetically, &quot;You were probably still just dreaming a little, sleepyhead! Anyways, Hannah, can you drive us home? It&#39;s only like midnight and I&#39;d like to get a little rest  before my test tomorrow.&quot; Hannah agreed. While they got dressed, Jennifer threw on an oversized shirt to cover herself. She was going right to sleep after the sisters left; she was exhausted. As she pulled the shirt out of her closet, she mused to herself, &quot;weren&#39;t there just a ton of dildos in the closet? Where did they all go?&quot; but not a thing was out of place from how Jennifer remembered leaving it before she went to school.<br />
<br />
She chalked it up to crazy dreams as she walked the fully clothed sisters to the front door. As they retrieved their shoes from the household lineup in front of the door, they thanked Jennifer for the good time, and trudged out to Hannah&#39;s car. Jennifer stepped over the line of shoes and stumbled her way back up the stairs. As Jennifer bundled up under the covers, she mulled over the weird dream that she had wanted to share with her friends. It felt really important, but right as she was about to share it, the thought had evaporated with a shiver. As her mind continued to mull it over, she quickly slipped off into a true sleep.</p>
