<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke the next day with the sun shining directly in his eyes. He realized that he must&#39;ve slept into the afternoon.<br />
Perhaps there was something to be said for going to bed angry.<br />
<br />
He remembered his goal for the day: return to the Magic Shop and see if something could be done about his situation.<br />
First, he had to take care of another kind of business. He exited into the hallway and made his way to the bathroom. Having to sit down to pee was a humiliating reminder of the urgency of this quest. As the urine tinkled from the slit between his thighs Jeff noticed a post-it note stuck to the wall. &quot;Don&#39;t forget to wipe front-to-back, Jeff! -Mom&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grimaced, but followed the instructions anyway, then returned to his room to fetch some clean clothes. He had been dreading this, but he really needed to shower.<br />
<br />
Stripping naked and deliberately avoiding his reflection in the bathroom mirror, Jeff stepped into the hot water and closed his eyes. He decided to make this a quick one. Just in and out, hopefully that way he wouldn&#39;t have to think too much about his body.<br />
It was unavoidable though, even as he kept his eyes shut tight and only scrubbed above his waist. He was still painfully aware of the loss of mass between his legs, and the hot water rand smoothly down his flat crotch.<br />
<br />
Toweling off was also a problem. There was no avoiding it, he had to dry off down there too. He tried to think happy thoughts, like how the old man at the Magic Shop would definitely have a solution.<br />
<br />
He redressed in boxer briefs (which were now loose in the front) and jeans with a plain t-shirt. Dressing in his everyday clothes actually made him feel a bit more confident. It was a nice change after nothing but hospital gowns and pajamas.<br />
<br />
As he headed downstairs and towards the front door, he noticed his mother sitting in the kitchen with a cup of coffee.<br />
&quot;Just going out for some fresh air.&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Okay sweetie, don&#39;t overdo it. Oh by the way, your sister said she was going out to get something for you.&quot;<br />
Jeff was puzzled. &quot;Get something for me? Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, she wouldn&#39;t say. Perhaps she&#39;s picking up a &#39;get well soon&#39; card from your class? Of course they don&#39;t know the real reason for your hospital stay.&quot;<br />
&quot;God, I hope it&#39;s not that.&quot; Jeff grumbled. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff made his way down the street, retracing his path from the Magic Shop to his home. As he was still recovering, he couldn&#39;t walk too quickly, and every so often he had to take a break when the area between his thighs became sore.<br />
Eventually he reached the empty lot that the Magic Shop had briefly occupied and his heart sank. It was empty once more.<br />
He just stood there and stared in silence for what felt like an eternity, a pit forming in his stomach.<br />
<br />
Perhaps he was misremembering, perhaps there was another empty lot on the same route. He traveled up and down the path he normally took to school until his legs began to ache and he couldn&#39;t bear to walk any more. He sat down my the road, defeated. His search had been fruitless. His pussy was sore from rubbing against his underwear.<br />
The Magic Shop was gone.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat in silence, a tear ran down his cheek. He was stuck like this. His dick was gone, along with any chance of ever restoring it. There was nothing he could do but mourn his loss.<br />
<br />
He was shaken out of his desolation by his phone vibrating in his back pocket.<br />
A text from Emily.<br />
&quot;hey big bro, got u some stuff i think ur gonna like ;D&quot;<br />
Jeff let out a strange involuntary chuckle at the mood whiplash.<br />
At least Emily was on his side no matter what.<br />
<br />
He pulled himself back up to his feet and began the slow trek back home. It was only a ten minute walk but it still felt like a miserable ordeal. He pushed open the front door and let it swing closed behind him as he slouched upstairs to his bedroom. Once inside, he flopped onto his bed with an exhausted sigh.<br />
<br />
His outstretched arm touched something. A paper shopping bag. What was this?<br />
There was a note taped to it: &quot;for when you&#39;re feeling better ;)&quot;<br />
Jeff sat up to examine the contents.<br />
First he withdrew a package of plain boyshort panties, like the kind you might buy at a department store.<br />
Underneath, he found a few pairs of feminine bikini-style panties and beneath those...<br />
...some extraordinarily skimpy lingerie, including a lace thong. What the hell, Emily?<br />
<br />
Finally there was an unmarked rectangular cardboard box. Jeff popped it open at one end and nearly jumped when a purple latex dildo slid out. Relatively plain and unrealistic and no longer than 8 inches.<br />
<br />
This was perhaps a bit TOO supportive. He&#39;d really given her the wrong idea the other night.<br />
He placed everything back into the bag and slid it under his bed. He could deal with that later. And by later he meant hopefully never.</p>
