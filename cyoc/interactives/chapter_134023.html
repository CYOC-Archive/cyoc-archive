<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked around and despite the fact that you had a need to protect Droze, you ultimately couldn’t for long if his wound got worse. You needed to find Lila at all costs, but if you left would you know where Droze was? <br />
<br />
You thought for a few moments, but your bladder suddenly felt full so you walked up to a nearby tree and lifted your hind leg up on instinct. You watched and felt the warm stream of piss exit your body, and as it did it left a very strong, yet peculiar scent on the ground. &quot;Geez,&quot; You thought as the smell invaded your nostrils, but then you paused and realized that you could use this as a method to locate Droze.<br />
<br />
You took another whiff of the air and focused hard on how your piss smelled and how strong of a scent it gave off. With your enhanced sense of smell you could probably go out searching for a few hours. Hopefully those other dragons weren’t out and about, and even more hopefully is that they didn’t know your scent. So you looked back at your dragon brother one last time before you leapt out into the forest in search of your aunt. <br />
<br />
______<br />
<br />
You had been out for about two hours now and we’re debating on returning back to Droze. You could still track the smell of your urine, but as time went on your concerns only grew worse. &quot;How would I even track Lila?&quot; You asked yourself then sighed,&quot;Maybe she has a very slightly similar scent to me? She is related to Mom, so....maybe. But what abooooh!&quot; You screamed then sighed tripped and found yourself in a crater about ten times the size of your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow,&quot; You said getting to your feet then suddenly you paused as you saw a certain resemblance in the shape of the crater to something you&#39;ve seen before. You managed to get out of the crater and examine it and then you realized something. This was a footprint, and upon further examination they matched your prints, a dragon was here at some point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are these fresh?&quot; You thought to yourself and then a new scent entered your nostrils and you paused. The scent surrounded the crater and as you sniffed it there was something oddly familiar about it. You sniffed more in order to try to determine what this was, but then you found your snout had met your own claw. &quot;What?&quot; You thought to yourself then you checked again then realized that this scent shared a very vague, very slight similarity to your own. It was a detail that you could&#39;ve missed completely, but a detail that you couldn’t ignore in the slightest.<br />
<br />
So you decided to follow it in one last ditch effort before you head back towards Droze, so you took off running towards whatever this scent originated from, and then you paused at the sound of what appeared to be weeping, a very loud weeping in a voice that reminded you of how your parents&#39; voices were as you spoke with them.<br />
<br />
You ran towards this sound and you found yourself at a pond, up on a ledge, and at the pond you noticed an adult dragoness crying into the waters. You didn’t know who she was at first, but then you saw a mark on her chest, or rather one going into her cleavage. The ledge dropped off twelve feet, and there was no telling how deep the pond was, but you needed to confirm this mark. You leaned forward and began to make out curved tips on the mark similar to like how your claws looked.<br />
<br />
It was then suddenly a small rock gave out beneath your front right claw and you tripped and fell forward screaming for your life. You flipped through the air trying to open and use your wings frantically, but as you panicked you couldn’t seem to focus on what you needed to do. It was then that you hit something solid, but it wasn’t wet and you laid on your back. <br />
<br />
You peered up and saw the dragoness had extended her claw to catch you and was looking at you with a very concerned expression. Her scales on her back were black, her underbelly was red, and as she brought you closer you saw the mark on her chest clearly. It was a indeed a clawmark, but you were suddenly brought to her attention when she growled,&quot;Do you know how dangerous that was whelp?! Where are your parents a....&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched the dragoness pause and her nose twitched slightly. She proceeded to inspect you thoroughly and sniff your body, and then suddenly her eyes widened and she stared at you in utter disbelief then said,&quot;You....You smell like my sister....like,&quot; she paused for a moment then roared,&quot;Droze!&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to her and said,&quot;Yes! I&#39;ve been looking for you, and we need you and.....I’m his brother...or new brother I guess. I was human too like you were, but he needs help! He&#39;s hurt, and he needs you! We need you!&quot; The dragoness nodded and said,&quot;Okay, if it’s this drastic then just take me to him! We can talk later just lead me there, we can probably get to him faster if you’re on me! I’m Lila, and if what you say is true then I’m your aunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could tell that she wasn’t sure if she should believe you or not, but the evidence was present in your scent, and she was desperate in her expression and didn’t want to take any chances. &quot;Okay! I have a scent trail set near him! I just need to get my bearings and we can go!&quot; You yapped and Lila nodded then placed you back on top of the cliff and climbed up.<br />
<br />
You sniffed around and got picked up on the trail you left, and you directed Lila in the direction from which you traveled from. She picked you up like a mother wolf would her pup, and dashed in the direction you came from. It only took a few minutes to reach the area where Droze was, and you squirmed around in order to tell Lila to stop. <br />
<br />
&quot;He’s here! He&#39;s here! Put me down!&quot; You yapped and Lila set you on the ground and firmly growled,&quot;Show me where he is now.&quot; You nodded then rushed into the dense trees and you found the tree you marked along with Droze easily.<br />
<br />
You uncovered Droze and shook him in order to wake him up, and yapped,&quot;DROZE!! Get the hell up right now!&quot; Droze opened his eyes and yawned and shook his head to wake up. &quot;Brother, what’s wrong?! Wait....you said a bad!&quot; Droze growled and you facepalmed in your claw and growled back,&quot;Yes! But now&#39;s not the time! I found our Aunt! Lila, right?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Droze&#39;s eyes widened and he yapped,&quot;You found Auntie Lila?! Where is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s waiting for us! C&#39;mon, I’ll help get you out to her!&quot; You growled then Droze nodded and slowly attempted to stand on three legs. You got down in the pit and shoved him up onto ground, and he yelped and fell onto his stomach. You then climbed out of the ditch and used your head to lift up Droze’s bad leg, and you noticed mosquitos flying around the area so you warded them off the best you could with your wing while also guiding him out to Lila.<br />
<br />
Once you got Droze within Lila&#39;s sight you saw her lean down and look at him surprised,&quot;Oh my gosh, you weren’t lying!&quot; She then saw Droze’s leg and screamed,&quot;Oh no, what happened to you Droze?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She put her claws around the two of you and held you both up to her face where you yapped,&quot;He was attacked by three bigger dragons, bigger than me! I saved him and ran off, but he that&#39;s beside the point! Can you fix him up?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lila peered closed and examined Droze’s leg wound and spoke as she did it. &quot;Large area, not too deep, muscle damage minimal and should heal up on its own, is closed...mostly, and it looks like mosquitoes got to it, but no flies, good!&quot; She said then she looked down at you and said,&quot;I can, I just need to find a palm leaf to act as a cast while it heals, we’re lucky...very lucky.&quot; <br />
<br />
You breathes a sigh of relief then collapsed in Lila&#39;s claw and said,&quot;Thank god! My life just got so fucked up.&quot; Lila heard you then flicked the back of your head with her claw, and it felt like someone smacked you. &quot;Ow!&quot; You whined then Lila hissed,&quot;Language, young man.&quot; Droze snickered a bit at this and you sighed then smiled and thought, &quot;At least he&#39;s in good spirits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I&#39;m going to take you two back to my cave. I assume you Uh....do you have a name yet?&quot; Lila asked and you shook your head,&quot;No....not yet,&quot; then you crawled closer to Lila and she leaned down putting her ear to you and you whispered,&quot;I&#39;ve had dreams, or....visions? But they will give me a name soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lila nodded to you and smiled, and you could automatically tell that she knew you were talking about your dream earlier. Lila then said,&quot;Now then, I will make up something back at my cave, you will take care of Droze and give it to him. I trust that you can take care of yourself until I come back with a palm leaf, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to Lila and said,&quot;I just care about Droze, I won’t touch anything I’m not supposed to.&quot; Lila nodded then she hobbled around on three legs walking in a direction. <br />
<br />
Eventually....</p>
