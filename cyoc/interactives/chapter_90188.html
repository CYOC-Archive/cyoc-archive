<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That fateful day I woke up with my erect manhood trying to impregnate my mattress, like every other morning. Too horny to keep sleeping, too sleepy to finish the deed; I’ve had to face that dilemma every single morning for the last eight years. I thought it was some puberty thing at first, but I was 21 now and my little guy just kept demanding more and more attention. <br />
My dad entered my room and opened the window’s blinds. The sunshine splattered on my face and I made a grunting sound. <br />
I told him, unable to open my eyes, that it was still too freaking early to get up. <br />
“Nonsense. Today is the big day. Time to shower and have breakfast, you big animal.” <br />
I just grunted some more. I hated when my father got so attentive and motherly with me. Well, actually I never met my mother, so I really can’t be sure what is motherly behavior and what is not. People usually felt sad for me when I told them that my mom died in a car accident shortly after I was born, but I just told them that it didn’t bother me: she’s a complete stranger to me, I couldn’t care less what happened to her. I had the impression my dad was trying to overcompensate this by being glued to me all day. He’s the coach of the college’s soccer team, and he obliged me to join even though I don’t give a damn about sports and being coached by your own father sucks. But he insisted, he said the exercise would do me good...and that I would never get into college any other way because of my grades. Look, I know my grades aren’t all that good, but that doesn’t mean I’m retarded, it’s just that I always had a hard time solving equations when I could just spend my time jacking-off instead.  <br />
“Stop making sex to the bed and get your butt up already!”, my dad said as he removed my bed covers in one swift movement and I flinched. I was just in my white briefs, my muscular backside exposed. I turned around. I’m very proud of my muscles, although I can’t stop thinking the reason I have them like that are my jacking-off sessions rather than the soccer practice. My pecs are big and hard, and while I don’t have a defined six-pack, I have what is commonly called a “muscle gut”. My arms and legs are also nothing to be ashamed of either and overall I’m the tallest guy of the team. But we all have insecurities. I have black hair clipped short on my head, slightly spiky. Nothing wrong with that. But the rest of my body is also covered in black hair: my chest, my arms, my legs, my butt and some even on my back! Some of my mates often teased me about it, calling me a caveman, the missing link, you name it. Although my stature combined with my hairy and muscular body gave me an intimidating look that I found kind of appealing, so I never even thought of shaving it off, that’s for pussies. I loved posing on my mirror as I jacked off, worshipping my own pecs. Although that brings me to my other insecurity: my dick. Yes, that little bugger which demands so much attention is tiny, my extensive pubic hair hiding most of it when soft. I was almost thankful that my balls were also quite small, or else my dick would get lost between them. <br />
“Are you ready to make your father proud?” <br />
<i>“I’d rather jack-off all day”</i>, I thought to myself. Today was the final match of the championship and the only reason I was slightly excited about it was that there won’t be any more matches until the next school year. And after that, nothing else to do other than to eat, wank and sleep all summer like an animal! <br />
I finished stretching, went to the bathroom, pissed and eyaculated on the toilet, had a shower, dressed up, had breakfast, shitted, had another quick wank taking advantage of the fact that I was already sitting on the toilet, and off we went. <br />
<br />
<center>***</center> <br />
<br />
<br />
 I always hated wearing that soccer uniform. It was at least two sizes too small for my burly build and it itched like hell. I was scratching my back through the fabric while my dad, I mean our coach was giving us the topical encouraging speech in the locker room, telling us how much he believes in our team, how hard we worked to get here, to get to give our best, and other boring crap. I gave out an audible yawn, and I thought I saw a glance of my father looking at me with a frown of disappointment. I didn’t care. When the rest of my team members got into the field my back-scratching hand had eventually gone down into my pants to relieve my itchy right buttcheck. <br />
“…Big guy”, my dad said. <br />
“Uh?”, I said absent-mindedly as I stretched my arms, taking my time to stand up. <br />
“This is the last match you’ll play this year. I want you to go out with a bang and use that muscles of yours for something useful…” <br />
“Yeah, sure…” I finally stood up and started to leave… <br />
“And Simon...Make your father proud, understood?” <br />
Damn, why did he have to be so dramatic? We’ll play lots of other boring matches after the summer, and I hated when he called me by my first name, it sounded so unlike him. <br />
The first half of the match was uneventful; nobody scored any goals, which happens very frequently in soccer matches. Forty minutes in I had gotten a raging erection but thankfully a two-inch boner isn’t very noticeable. However by halftime it still hadn’t subsided. Damn, I needed to get rid of it! I locked up myself in a small stall in the locker rooms and after some tugging I blew a small load...Damn, my balls were still half-full! Thankfully the break is 15 minutes long… <br />
<br />
<i>*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*</i><br />
“Big guy? Are you still in there? The second half is about to start, and we need you on the field!” <br />
That second load was harder to spew than I expected. I had shifted my position so many times I somehow had ended up suspended in the air, my feet against each of the walls of the narrow stall, my hands occupied with my dick. <br />
<i>*KNOCK* *KNOCK* </i><br />
“Big guy, are you alright? Answer me!”, said my father worried. <br />
I didn’t answer. <br />
“Are you hurt? If you don’t answer me I’ll tear this door down right now!” <br />
Still no answer. <br />
My father got a running start and charged against the door with his elbow.  <br />
<i>*CRASH*</i> <br />
“What is it?”, I said to him with all the calm in the world. <br />
“You’re...fine? Why didn’t you answer the door?” <br />
“It was a very big dump, that’s all.” <br />
He stared at me with his mouth open, blinking a few times. Hehe, I had finished the deed pulled up my pants on time. He didn’t suspect a thing, the perfect crime. <br />
“Well, I’m off to the field”, I said calmly and started marching on as my father stood there speechless. He looked at the door he had just broken without a good reason, and into the toilet… <br />
Damn, I had forgot to flush! <br />
<br />
<center>***</center> <br />
<br />
 It was very uncomfortable playing on the field while my father stared at me with a pale, expressionless face. It would have been much less humiliating to just play the second half with a boner, it’s not like anybody was going to notice. I was so ashamed I couldn’t concentrate in the match at all. I missed a pass directed to me, which made it easy for the opposing team to steal the ball and score a goal. Oh, but we didn’t lose. We won 2-1! My team went nuts! It was an avalanche of high-fives and whatnots, but my father didn’t celebrate our victory. Some of my teammates looked at him, puzzled, ”why is he so serious? We won!”, they probably thought. <br />
<br />
 When the excitement died down and everybody went home, I had no other choice but to face my dad. “Erm...Dad?” I said, still terrorized at the thought that my father of all people had seen my spunk floating on the water closet. “We had a great match, didn’t we? Haha...Shouldn&#39;t we get in the car and go home a to celebrate already...? <br />
“I have to make some calls first, Simon.” His voice didn’t sound angry at all, but the fact that he didn’t call me “big guy” scared me shitless. “Wait for me in the locker room.” <br />
I did as he said and he entered a small storage room next to the locker rooms that, just by placing a desk on it, he could use as an improvised private office. I heard him dial the office’s land line phone. Yes, he is one of those old-fashioned dads who have absolutely no idea how smartphones work. After putting on my regular street clothes, I couldn’t resist, and I got closer to the office’s door, trying to figure out who was he talking to… <br />
“...Yes, I know...I agreed to that condition, and I don’t regret that...He’s not a bad boy...But I think that he may be lower than 50%... He’s getting uncontrollable lately...No, he hasn’t been tested since he was a baby...Yes, another testing would be okay, just to make sure...I’m aware that if it turns out to be lower than that...No, but I just want the best for him...Maybe this life isn’t what he needs...Yes, I’m fine with that, if it’s for his wellbeing...Yes, I’m free for the rest of the day...This afternoon? Yes, it’ll be better if I make sure of his percentage as soon as possible, I’ll try to convince him to come along…” <br />
Who the hell was he talking to? Nothing of it made any sense! He heard him hung up, so I went back to the locker rooms before he caught me. When he came back, he just told me to get in the car. But I had the sensation we weren’t going home. <br />
“Look, Simon”, First name again, he was still pissed. “I called your doctor, we agreed that you should get your blood analyzed…” <br />
“What?...Why are you suddenly interested in a blood analysis for me?...Are you worried I got a STD?...That’s ridiculous, I’m a virgin!” Did he really thought I was some sort of sexual deviant just because he discovered that I jacked off in the bathroom? <br />
But we went to the hospital anyway...Uhm...Why didn’t we go to our usual health clinic? This one is much farther away...Geez, it’s practically in the forest on the outskirts of our town. But the building was enormous and the entrance was decorated with beautiful gardens that blended well with the forest, I couldn’t even see where the gardens ended and the forest began. It looked like a very prestigious facility.  <br />
“Timberwood is very respected clinic worldwide. They are specialized in providing unprecedented healthcare to people like you.” My father said as he was parking the car. <br />
“People like me?”, I wondered what he meant <br />
“Err...You know, young adults.” <br />
“I see.” <br />
We got out of the car. “Timberwood General Hospital & Veterinary Clinic”, stated a the sign over the main gate. Well, that way if you’re ever hospitalized nobody would care if you’d bring your pet along with you, I guess, but I hoped the veterinary clinic was situated on a separate section of the building, I didn’t want to pass by lots of dogs and their respective fleas as we went to get my blood extracted. Yes, it’s true, I’m not exactly an animal lover, they are smelly and noisy poop makers. I never understood what was the big deal about owning a pet. When we passed through the entrance I was glad there were no animals running around in there, and common sense told me that they probably go to to one of the hospital’s adjacent buildings. <br />
After spending an infernal half-an-hour in the waiting room, they finally called out my name. As I entered the extraction room, my dad went to talk to the doctor in private. <br />
“Is he the one? He looks like a perfect fifty-pluser to me” I heard the doctor say. <br />
“Yes, and I thought so too, but when he was a baby they told me there was a small margin of error, as their genetic code is very similar, that would decrease as he entered puberty…” <br />
“But he’s 21! Shouldn’t have you had him tested like, six or seven years ago?” <br />
“I thought about it, but, I guess I just wasn’t ready to know at the time, he seemed so happy with me. But his behavior has been getting uncontrollable lately and…Well, I just want to make sure.” <br />
“That’s understable, they are always cute when they are kids, but ultimately you have to decide what’s best for them”. <br />
They apparently thought that if they spoke in a low voice then I wouldn’t be able to hear anything, do they think I’m deaf and dumb? I didn’t like how the way they referred to me, as just another of “them kids”...And I couldn’t understand half of what they were saying! What’s a “fifty-pluser”? <br />
The doctor finally turned and spoke to me with a smile. “Simon, please, sit down in this chair over here…”  <br />
I sat in a comfortable chair with big armrests. I tried to roll up my sleeve so the doctor could place a strap on my arm, but it didn’t roll up enough. I had no other choice but to take my shirt off. The expression on the doctor’s face changed when he saw my hairy chest, neither to disgust nor admiration, but concern. What was wrong with being hairy? He looked at it like it was a symptom of cancer or something. <br />
He placed the strap on my arm and, while I had been vaccinated for all sorts of diseases during my life, I still shuddered a bit when I saw the needle. <br />
“Don’t worry, Simon. It’ll be over in just a second…” <br />
And he wasn’t lying, it only lasted a second. A very painful second. <br />
<br />
<center>***</center><br />
<br />
<br />
 I was still shirtless, holding a piece of cotton on my haemorrhage when the doctor came back <br />
“49’7%” Said the doctor without any hint of expression on his face. <br />
My father went pale. “But...But...0,3%...It’s not that of a big deal...Right?” The doctor didn’t respond. He looked at me, I could tell he was in the verge of crying a river, but he would never do that while I was looking. <br />
“You already told it about what the consequences would be, am I right?” said the doctor with a serious tone. Why was he calling me “it”? <br />
“No, I didn’t want to worry him without a reason...I already suspected he had such a percentage long ago, but, still...” <br />
...What the hell were they talking about?! <br />
“49’7% of what? Do I have a disease? Am I sick? Am I going to die?!” <br />
My father got close to me and hugged me. <br />
“I’m very sorry, big guy...I haven’t been as honest as I should be with you…This wasn’t a regular check-up, it was a paternity test. <br />
A paternity test...? <br />
“...I-I don’t mind if you’re not my real father, e-even if I was adopted, you have always been the father I know and love!” <br />
“And you will always be my son in my heart, big guy...But I’m afraid that…” <br />
“Step away from it! It could get emotionally unstable! It could hurt you!” yelled the doctor. <br />
My father seemed pissed at him. <br />
“No! He’s not dangerous! The only uncontrollable behavior I was referring to was his compulsive masturbation!”, answered my father. <br />
That’s right, I wasn’t dangerous but, did he really have to be so blunt?! But the doctor had already called the security guards. <br />
“Hey, what’s the big idea!? I didn’t do anything!” <br />
“I’m sorry, big guy, but when a young gorilla is strolling around freely in human territory, this is what usually happens.” <br />
“There’s a gorilla in the building?! Oh, god, we have to get out of here!” I said as I ran away, but when I got to the door a bunch of strong men wearing soft padded armour with “Animal Control” written on it were standing in the corridor. “Thank god, the cavalry has arrived!” I thought, but then one of men neutralized me with a taser gun and then said to his walkie-talkie <br />
“The situation is under control. We’ve captured the gorilla” as the others grabbed me and locked me up in a cage. <br />
<br />
 I don’t know how much time passed until I recovered from the electroshock, but my cage had been carried to a dark room. A door opened, and there was another doctor and beside him...My father! He’ll clear up the misunderstanding! <br />
“Your foster father and I have been talking and we have reached an agreement. I’m sorry for how you’ve been treated, Simon.” <br />
“I’m locked up in a motherfucking cage!” <br />
My father told me to keep my voice low, that this doctor won’t be bad to me like the other one. <br />
“We’ve been discussing how to tell you the truth about yourself” said the doctor. “It’s very unusual that these facts have been hidden from you for so long. Have you ever heard of the expression, “an image is worth a thousand words”? Well, here’s a photo that could clear a few things up…” He took out a tablet, selected a photo, and showed it to me. <br />
“Do you know who is this?” <br />
“It’s a gorilla.” I said. <br />
“And this one?”, he swiped the screen and a different photo appeared. <br />
“It’s another gorilla”. <br />
“Do any of them ring a bell to you?” <br />
“Not really, I’m not too fond of animals.” <br />
The doctor seemed disappointed that I wasn’t impressed at all with his photos. He kept on swiping. <br />
The next one was a photo of my dad handshaking someone, but he looked much younger, he was about my own age. “Hey! That’s my dad!” <br />
“And the handsome fellow he’s greeting with a firm handshake is me!” the doctor said proudly. He didn’t look that handsome to me at all. “Twenty-one years ago, your father agreed to subject himself to a scientific experiment.” <br />
“What?! Did they hurt you, dad?” <br />
“Don’t worry, big guy, all they did to me was to take a sperm sample.” <br />
“Oh…” <br />
The next photo was so morbid and repugnant I almost puked. It was a photo of some scientists injecting a serum into one of the gorilla&#39;s testicles. <br />
&quot;Why are you showing me a photo of a gorilla being chemically castrated?&quot; <br />
The doctor laughed. &quot;Quite the contrary, the gorilla is having his natural semen replaced by a quite powerful serum fabricated thanks to years of research and a generous human sperm donor.&quot; Dad blushed as the doctor said this. &quot;You see, we reverse-engineered the DNA of a large number of animals to be able to reproduce with partners of different species to...&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s completely crazy! You wanted to create an army of hybrids?!&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous, you&#39;ve certainly watched too many Sci-Fi movies. No, our original plan was to create animals that were able to produce organs suitable to be transplanted into a human body. But everyone went nuts when the serum was even more powerful than expected...And so offspring like you were born...&quot; He showed me a photo of a female gorilla giving birth to a human-like baby. Part of me was horrorized at such an abomination of nature, but another part of me was putting all the pieces together...And I wasn&#39;t liking it one bit. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re telling me I&#39;m the product of your crazy experiment?...&quot; <br />
&quot;No...And yes. But it wasn&#39;t our intention to create human hybrids. Most of the animals produced either completely human offspring or their &quot; natural&quot; ones, but the hybrids were declared too human-like to be used for organ harvesting...Freaking Greenpeace...But anyway, the project was cancelled, the human offsprings were given up for adoption at regular orphanages, the animal ones were sent to zoos and the hybrids were sent to special centers where they can live in harmony as we monitor them. Unfortunately, while most are quite obvious hybrids just by looking at them, we had to perform DNA tests to determine if some of them were more human than animal. And that&#39;s where I have to step in to apologize...&quot; <br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
&quot;We messed up your initial test...You were a newborn by then, and the DNA of humans and monkeys are 99% identical...Well...&quot; <br />
Dad chimed in. &quot;Don&#39;t worry big fella, I have been raising you the wrong way all these years, but they&#39;ll take great care of you at the Hybrid Containment Center. Their simulated habitats will be a better place for you to live rather than trying to furiously masturbate all day in any human house. You wouldn&#39;t even need to wear clothes any more, and you&#39;ll meet up with all sorts of hybrids, some even more animal than you! And we have a surprise...We talked with the state zoo, and they have agreed to bring your biological father to the Center for you to meet him! Such a shame your mother was killed so many years ago when she was run over by a truck after foolishly trying to escape...&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait what?! You want me to live in some sort of weird zoo-prison for failed experiments?!...And what do you mean I wouldn&#39;t have to wear clothes?! I do much more in life than just masturbate, you know! I can contribute to society! Let me out of here! You&#39;re all crazy! This is all ridiculous! I...&quot; I felt how a tranquilizer dart landed on my leg, and my protests were dying bit by bit until I completely passed out. I don&#39;t know how much time passed, but when I woke up I was in a completely different place...</p>
