<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was trapped under the singlet. No, no, no, he kept repeating in his mind. This can&#39;t be real. Did he actually just hear Kurt say he wasn&#39;t going to take him off to be washed? That it was unlucky to wash a jockstrap. Oh god, Jeff was going to be so grimy and smelly by the end of this! How long was wrestling season again?!<br />
<br />
Jeff lamented his disgusting fate as Kurt walked on into the locker room. Jeff was absolutely appalled. It felt like his whole mouth was wrapped around this dumb, smelly jocks sweaty cock and balls. He could taste and smell it all! Kurt had a fairly impressive cock and rather large balls. Being straight, this was an absolute nightmare to him. He didn&#39;t want to be tasting and smelling any guys crotch, let alone this sweaty stinky jocks crotch! Gross!!! Not only that, it seemed Kurt hadn&#39;t heard of trimming or shaving at all down there! Kurt&#39;s thick hairy pubes seemed to trap all the sweat and stench and make it worse. And the hairs scratched and rubbed against Jeff&#39;s jockstrap body! <br />
<br />
After the match, Kurt&#39;s body exuded a very pungent body odor, that honestly just stunk. Jeff was absorbing all of the musky scents against his will, and they were seriously making him sick. Kurt was one stinky dude. Sniffing concentrated ball stink from this nasty jock was one of the nastiest things Jeff could imagine, but here he was, with his &quot;mouth&quot; stuffed full of Kurt&#39;s sweaty cock, tasting and smelling his sweaty crotch. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know what was going on because he was trapped in the dark musky confined of Kurt&#39;s singlet, but he felt Kurt sit down. Seconds later he heard a car engine start and they began moving. Kurt arrived home and got out a few minutes later. Walking up to his room, Kurt shucked off his sweaty singlet, leaving him in just his dirty jockstrap. Jeff looked around, suddenly able to see. Kurt&#39;s room was filthy and stunk just as bad as he did. Kurt walked over to a mirror and began to flex. His biceps popped and thick pit bushes spilled out. &quot;Nice, I got a nice workout at practice&quot;, he said to himself. Jeff looked at the mirror and saw himself. He was just a dirty, stinky jockstrap! His whole pouch body was stretched out and distended from holding Kurt&#39;s huge sweaty cock and balls. Jeff could see some pubes spilling out of the sides of the pouch, to his disgust. He wanted to scream, to move, to run away, to spit out the taste of dirty sweaty cock out of his mouth, but he couldn&#39;t do a single thing! This was a nightmare!<br />
<br />
As Kurt was flexing in the mirror, he reached down and began to massage his fat nuts. Then Jeff felt a pressure building up in the pouch. Kurt was getting hard! &quot;No no no no !&quot;, Jeff thought to himself. Another man was getting hard inside of him! Kurt chuckled to himself as he dug a thick hand in the jock and began to slowly stroke his meat, stretching Jeff&#39;s body out. <br />
<br />
Kurt&#39;s fat cock slowly became more and more engorged with blood, and within a handful of seconds, he was as hard as a rock.  His fat cockhead was tenting Jeff&#39;s body you painfully. Kurt moaned deeply as his fist began slowly pumping up and down his cock. Precum spurt out of the tip, getting all over Jeff&#39;s body. It tastes salty and gross, and Jeff was absolutely horrified at the knowledge he was tasting another man&#39;s precum!<br />
<br />
He was in hell, he thought to himself, as the jock pimped his rod up and down. Jesus, his whole body was stretched to the point that he felt like he would rip. How big of a cock did Kurt even have, it felt like he had a horse cock!<br />
<br />
Kurt moaned in a deep voice and Jeff felt Kurt&#39;s hairy balls draw up towards his body. Second later, Kurt let loose and squirted rope after rope of thick, warm, cum all over the inside of Jeff. Jeff would have screamed if he was physically able to! The warn ropes splattered Jeff&#39;s dirty, stinking fabric, making him even more filthy. Jeff could taste and smell the cum, and it was horrible! Never in a million years would he have ever thought he would be tasting another man&#39;s cum, let alone this hairy stinking jock&#39;s! Kurt kept moaning and bucking him hips, grinding his erection into Jeff and smearing more cum into him. 8, 9, 10 shots of cum?! How much was inside of this guy?!<br />
<br />
After Kurt stopped moaning and his cock stopped firing into Jeff, his massive length slowly started to deflate inside of Jeff&#39;s sticky, dirty body. As Jeff stewed in the scents and taste of old sweat, balls, and a huge hot load, he wondered to himself when this hell was going to be over!<br />
<br />
He knew for a fact that Kurt never washed his smelly jockstrap the entire wrestling season, and the season had only just begun! It was going to be months before he was cleaned again! Months strapped around a dirty, smelly, musky 19 year old wrestlers cock!</p>
