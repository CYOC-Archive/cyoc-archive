<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the Five Elements had learned a lot about American culture in general, and Shuixing especially with regard to her relationship with Nate. In this they had learned on the holiday&#39;s importance to how Christians made important dates in the life of Jesus Christ holidays in their calendar. Christmas, for his birth, and Easter, for his death and resurrection. It was different and the Elements didn&#39;t fully catch on to all the religious applications for it, but some of the celebrations that went along with it were interesting and Huoxing got a bit of a kick out of the brightly colored eggs. Even if she couldn&#39;t eat them as a Red Panda Animalian, she did seem to enjoy the painting of them, and was happy to share them with her sisters that could eat them.<br />
<br />
As such, the group made their way to the Brown Farm, which had special tables set up behind the main house that were decorated and prepared for the painting of the larger eggs that the various Chicken Animalians laid. Various Animalians seemed to also enjoy painting them, and even a few people did. It was something that made the entire arrangement fun for all, as some of the adults and those that were older that were painting the larger eggs were able to make more detailed art than just trying to dye eggs one solid color or in in straight and level rainbow colors. This was something that Huoxing seemed to like and she was hopping up and down as they looked for a table that was open.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure on what the purpose of the eggs serves,&quot; Liao commented to Tuxing, &quot;from what you told me, this holiday has no rabbits, eggs, or chocolate in it. Just the actions of a tyranny murdering an innocent man for who he was and his simply happening to come back to life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still fun!&quot; Huoxing said with a smile as she looked back over her shoulder to Tuxing walking with Liao, &quot;Neat colors and pictures... Great fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuxing slowly nodded with a small smile. Huoxing was always excited about these things, and in a way, Tuxing remembered Huoxing always keeping her sisters happy... or at least as happy as they could be back in their confinement before Ping rescued them. While Tuxing would try to keep Huoxing from getting too excited, particularly as while Liao was showing signs of recuperation, there were some things and issues were quite serious. However, painting the eggs seemed like a perfectly harmless endeavor and it would be something to do, since most of Lyre and Animalia were pretty much closed for the holiday.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m that good at art...&quot; Liao said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to be,&quot; Tuxing said softly and patted Liao&#39;s upper back, &quot;I&#39;m not that great an artist, either... but it is fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention we get to share the egg later!&quot; Jinxing said confidently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or eggs,&quot; Muxing commented.<br />
<br />
Shuixing slowly followed behind her sisters when she noticed Blueberry and Strawberry seated together at a different nearby table. The former cows from Nate&#39;s family&#39;s farm were painting eggs like most of the other guests that were there, though from Shuixing thought she saw, it looked like the eggs they were painting were plastic. That got her a bit curious. She glanced to see the others settling in at the table and beginning to debate over how many eggs to paint, one for each or sharing an egg among all of them. All of the elements but Shuixing could eat eggs, though Red Pandas didn&#39;t eat meat all that often in the wild. In this, Shuixing was mostly a long to be with her sisters, though she couldn&#39;t shake her curiosity, and so she made her way over toward Blueberry and Strawberry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Easter, Shuixing,&quot; Blueberry said with a smile as her ears twitched after hearing some of the elements conversation in the background, &quot;I hope is all is well with you and your sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are good,&quot; Shuixing nodded as she approached, &quot;Excited for painting eggs and the fun that comes along with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Easter was always big on the farm too,&quot; Strawberry added as she looked up to Shuixing as she come up, &quot;we often gotten something special to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we remember Nate and his family often hunting eggs in their back yard,&quot; Blueberry added with a small smile, &quot;we were sort of working for something that would be an Easter present.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By painting plastic eggs?&quot; Shuixing commented as she looked to the eggs on the table in front of them. They were indeed plastic and were presently open in two parts. The top half was painted light blue with fluffy white clouds and gold crosses in between the clouds. The lower half  didn&#39;t have much paint on it at all, and the plastic was actually a pastel green color already. There, Shuixing could see what looked like crude paintings of brown cattle walking along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Along with some crude notes and candy,&quot; Blueberry nodded, &quot;Things to let Mr. Bowman know that we remember him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we thank him for the kindness he&#39;s showed us over the years,&quot; Strawberry added.<br />
<br />
Shuixing watched as Strawberry held up a small notepad which included a handwritten &quot;thank you&quot; on it. Strawberry&#39;s name was then signed after the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think everyone will like that,&quot; Shuixing commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Meryl can&#39;t misunderstand anything because it&#39;s all written down,&quot; Blueberry chuckled, remembering the woman who was generally kind hearted, but was extremely heard of hearing and stubborn enough that she&#39;d often remembered some of the &quot;trouble&quot; that that caused.<br />
<br />
Even Shuixing couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at that. She wasn&#39;t the sort to laugh at jokes aimed at people, but she could understand some of the frustration that Nate and his father often had trying to convince Meryl of things only to have Meryl then snap at them when she finally did hear something they said. In some ways it almost came off as comedy. Some things were about to progress a bit further when a tap on her shoulder got Shuixing to turn and find Jinxing standing there with a smile on her silver furred muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think we have a plan on what to paint, sister,&quot; Jinxing commented, &quot;if you&#39;d care to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Shuixing nodded and politely excused herself to rejoin her sisters.</p>
