<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Author&#39;s note: Sex is only either discussed or overheard in this episode.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
With their parents caught up in their own (sexual) needs, Nate Anderson fixed a big plate of sandwiches before grabbing a couple of sodas to take upstairs to share with his brother Eric.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve lucked out so far,&quot; he said, having the meal in his younger brother&#39;s room. &quot;When they finally realize we&#39;re home, just say you have a lot of homework and that you&#39;ve already eaten, which is partially true,&quot; observed Nate, noticing the stack of books Eric always carried around with him.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not all homework. Some of it I&#39;m just reading either for fun or to get ahead.&quot;<br />
Nate took another look at the volumes and thought, <i>If this is his idea of fun, I&#39;d love to see Eric when he&#39;s serious!</i><br />
&quot;Anyway, you should be over the worst of Julie&#39;s physical attack by morning with a good night&#39;s rest and another ice pack or two, but don&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s still sore for another day or so.&quot;<br />
In the background, they could hear their parents still going at it downstairs in their father&#39;s study. &quot;Is sex always like that?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
Being a werewolf, Nate had the more acute hearing than Eric as a normal human being. He paused to listen to Martha and William Anderson fuck each other with great passion. Then turned to his brother and said, &quot;First off, the den isn&#39;t as soundproof as the basement or their bedroom. Secondly, it can be highly enjoyable if done right, but that sounds like a slow night for them,&quot; he added with a grin.<br />
&quot;Well, they certainly do love each other,&quot; observed Eric.<br />
<br />
LATER...<br />
While Eric kicked back and relaxed with a book in his room, Nate went to his bedroom and finished his actual homework, but it took longer than first thought because there was something else weighing heavily on his mind.<br />
What to do about his estranged girlfriend Kenya Adaeze?<br />
There was no denying he still had feelings for the werepanthress. That Kenya wanted to attempt reconciliation showed she still had feelings for him too. Yet the fact Kenya cheated on Nate with another were who proposed to her was very hard to take.<br />
<i>Damned if I do, damned if I don&#39;t,</i> realized Nate, as he picked up his cellphone and made the call.<br />
&quot;Hello? Nathaniel?&quot; he heard Kenya say after answering on the very first ring, as if she had stayed by her phone every second, waiting for him to call.<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve been thinking...&quot; said Nate, pausing to make sure he was doing the right thing before speaking again. &quot;I want to give us another chance. I want to give you another chance, but things have to be different this time.&quot;<br />
&quot;They will be my dear Nathaniel. Other than this one error on my part, the rest of my former clientele know that my alter ego has retired from the professional escort business.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all well and good, but considering some of the nights we&#39;ve had together, I&#39;m beginning to suspect you&#39;re addicted to sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? How can that be?&quot; protested Kenya. &quot;It is true that weres have naturally higher libidos, and there have been times when I&#39;ve been insatiable in bed, but still...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a natural ailment. Even normal humans suffer from it,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Kenya in disbelief.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. Anyway, what I want you to do is start seeing a therapist or some other qualified professional about your... problem.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like your next door neighbor Doctor Frances Twist?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. She&#39;s also a werecat, so will be highly qualified to discuss the matter from either perspective,&quot; pointed out Nate.<br />
&quot;If this means we shall still be together, I promise I will call her tomorrow,&quot; swore Kenya.<br />
The two of them talked for a little while longer, with Nate promising Kenya a date that coming weekend if she kept her promise of seeing Frances, before they hung up for the evening.<br />
With that, Nate laid in his bed and thought about the future, feeling no remorse at all that he still had a date this Thursday night.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
After finishing his homework and reading a book on Astrophysics for awhile, Eric noticed the time and got on his computer.<br />
He had been relaxing in his bed with a cold ice pack between his cock and right thigh that his brother smuggled in for him, so Eric barely limped to his computer desk  and logged into his Skype account.<br />
Thankful that Nate had closed and locked the bedroom door after his last visit, Eric waited anxiously for his girlfriend Spencer Lawson to appear.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before WULFGRRRL wanted a video chat with BRAINY.<br />
&quot;Hey Eric,&quot; Spencer said with a smile. &quot;How you feeling?&quot; The fact that her video camera only showed Spencer wearing her underwear along with her headset microphone stirred feelings within him he thought would be numb for awhile.<br />
&quot;Better now that I see you,&quot; he replied with a smile of his own. Except for having removed everything from the waist down because of the ice pack, Eric was still fully dressed.<br />
&quot;I had a nice long chat with Frieda. The two of us are on for Friday night, and then you&#39;re Saturday night,&quot; she said, anxiously counting the moments until Eric was a were so they could finally be together in the ultimate physical expression of their love.<br />
&quot;Good. Then even if Julie doesn&#39;t keep her promise to her father and yours, then I won&#39;t have to worry about that bitch any more.&quot;<br />
&quot;Err... Eric. You do remember me, you, and Frieda getting together is not because of Julie, but for us, right?&quot; asked Spencer, concerned and remembering Nate&#39;s text message to her from earlier.<br />
&quot;I know dear, but you&#39;re not the one who almost had his dick snapped off today. Besides, if her attack was successful and I became a were-merman instead of fulfilling our plan of becoming a werepanther to be with you, would you still love me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Love, yes, because you would still be the Eric Anderson I fell in love with, even if you wound up with scales instead of fur,&quot; she said without hesitation.<br />
&quot;I love you too Spencer, but I&#39;d rather be running beside you through the woods than swimming in some pool.&quot;<br />
Eric&#39;s girlfriend just smiled and asked what the status of his penis was.<br />
&quot;I had another ice pack on it, so it&#39;s kind of numb right now. Nate said I&#39;d be over the worst of this by morning, but might not get to fully use it painlessly for another day or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoughts of slicing up the were-mermaid as chum crossed Spencer&#39;s mind as she leaned forward in her chair and said, &quot;So maybe I better not tease you tonight,&quot; as she raised both hands to caress her bra covered breasts.<br />
The sight of those luscious, cloth covered mounds stirred Eric in many ways, including his sore organ. &quot;Tease away honey. I&#39;m just not in a good position to join you tonight,&quot; he said sadly.<br />
&quot;Well, I can be a caring and loving girlfriend too,&quot; she replied, blowing Eric a kiss but leaving her breasts covered. &quot;But I just wanted to make sure you&#39;re still cool about me and Frieda getting together Friday night, let alone the three of us the next night.&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as you&#39;re okay with Friday, I&#39;m okay with Saturday. You should of heard my folks going at it when we got home. At least a good hour and a half before they finally stopped for dinner and realized we were home.&quot;<br />
&quot;My folks went out naked and furry after supper and haven&#39;t been back since,&quot; replied Spencer.<br />
&quot;We certainly come from some interesting backgrounds,&quot; observed Eric.<br />
&quot;That we do,&quot; agreed Spencer, &quot;which reminds me. Frieda wants to get to know both of us socially before this weekend. So if you have no plans after school tomorrow...&quot;<br />
&quot;Depending upon what kind of day I have, I might not be up to walking home from school, but otherwise that sounds good. I know a lot of people there, but I don&#39;t have many actual friends at Moon Lake High.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me neither, and I&#39;ve got the suspicion Frieda might be in the same boat.&quot;<br />
&quot;So does that mean Frieda might want to go beyond Saturday night with us?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;Would that be a bad thing if she does?&quot; asked Spencer in return.<br />
&quot;Friendship wise, hell no. Sexually...&quot; began Eric, as his voice trailed off.<br />
&quot;An open relationship seems to work well for all our parents. Besides, it would just be me, you, and Frieda if she does.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I think I might have my dad&#39;s hang up on that,&quot; confessed Eric. &quot;I&#39;d have no problem sharing you with other women, if you&#39;re agreeable to that and don&#39;t mind sharing me with them too, but I&#39;d like to be the only guy in your life. That isn&#39;t greedy, is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Considering you&#39;re the only guy I want? I don&#39;t think so. But like I told you earlier, one day at a time honey,&quot; Spencer reminded him. <i>And once you do become a werepanther, I hope your libido is in high gear for awhile because I&#39;m certainly going to make up for lost time with you,</i> she thought, doing her best to keep from licking her lips in front of the webcam.</p>
