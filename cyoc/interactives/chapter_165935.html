<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan returned to where Zach and Lucy were sunbathing and handed them both the ice creams he’d bought at the café after his little stop at the toilet. He sat down to Zach’s right and ate his own ice cream as he thought about what he wanted to do to his new friends next. <br />
While pondering, he casually swapped a few passersby, just to see what he could do. An old man walking arm in arm with his wife suddenly became an elderly lady, his corduroy trousers and check shirt transformed into a long lacy dress. A 19 year old girl practising some dance moves with her friends nearby, meanwhile, became a handsome, twinky 19 year old boy – her athletic top disappeared, leaving her new toned male pecs on full display, while her two ear rings were replaced by one dangly cross in one ear. Dan admired the way her – his – floppy male hair-do bounced with the twists and turns of her body. He enjoyed the hint of a rather virile new penis in the former girl’s tight athletic shorts. He decided to grab the newly-minted guy’s number before leaving the park. <br />
<br />
Dan spotted a muscular jock walking down the footpath wearing a football top and talking loudly on the phone about the latest league stats. Dan rolled his eyes – the guy was cute, but that obsession with football was off-putting. He scanned around until he spotted a woman in her 40s who looked to be a children&#39;s cartoon obsessive. She was lounging on a cartoon beach towel, wearing a garish cartoon princess t-shirt, had a cartoon tote bag and seemed to be wearing cartoon sunglasses. A quick thought later, and the woman was wearing a football shirt and was sitting on a towel emblazoned with the badge of the local football team. The guy stopped and paused mid-conversation, puzzled. He was now wearing a t-shirt covered in cartoon princesses that looked painted on his torso, as well as a baseball cap adorned with cartoon animal ears. His confused expression indicated to Dan that, as he wanted, the guy was well aware that his former passion for football had just, inexplicably, been replaced by a love of cartoons. He was tugging at his shirt with one hand to get a better look at what had changed, while his other was reaching for the ridiculous new cap. <br />
<br />
“Um, sorry dude, something’s just come up, I’m gunna have to call you back.” The guy hung up on whoever he was talking to, and he hurried off to explore his new clothes in the toilet at the park café.<br />
<br />
Dan smirked, satisfied with his idle changes. But what to do with his pals?<br />
<br />
Having eaten their ice cream cones, both Zach and Lucy had lain back down on the towels to sunbathe again. They both appeared to be in a half doze, but Dan could see that Zach’s hand was lightly stroking Lucy’s hairy, meaty right thigh, fingers brushing ever so gently against her tasty-looking bulge. <br />
<br />
Dan admired it – while it wasn’t pornographically massive, it was clear that Greg had been packing a decent-sized dick before he’d lost it and his manly body to Lucy. Dan turned his attention to Zach, admiring his own diver’s form and focused on what he had hidden in his speedos. The tightness of his trunks made it harder to get a good idea, but from what Dan could make it, it was probably a similar size to Lucy’s, maybe a little larger. <br />
<br />
Dan wondered how both of them being similarly endowed would play out in the bedroom. Did it mean they both played a fairly equal role in the bedroom, taking it in turns to top and bottom? Did either of them even want to bottom? <br />
<br />
Based on the way Greg in Lucy’s body continued to flirt with those girls just like a man in a man’s body, Dan assumed that Zach would be the top in the relationship. But not for much longer – Dan  wanted to switch things up a little for them in the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Licking his lips at what Zach was packing, Dan made the switch. He watched as Zach’s speedo deflated in the front, and winced as his own crotch filled out, forcing him to shift position to give his new and improved equipment more room. He hadn’t appreciated how tight the underpants he’d inherited from Rhys were – he looked down as he was adjusting his crotch and admired the way his shorts, which were previously loose and flat, bulged in the front. It wasn’t huge, but it was a nice size even for a body as tall as this one. <br />
<br />
Intrigued, Dan looked over at Zach to admire his new down-sized crotch. Where his speedos fitted nicely before, they were now very loose in front, with a lot of excess fabric disguising the small tent formed by Zach’s new cocklet and balls. The extra fabric meant that the speedos now shifted out of position with Zach’s every movement – it wasn’t long before Dan got a glimpse of Zach’s bush, and he was pleasantly surprised to see that Zach now had bright ginger pubes – clearly they had swapped over in the exchange. Presumably, that meant that Dan had Zach’s old blond thatch. <br />
<br />
Dan suddenly spotted the girl he had transformed into a guy seemed to be getting ready to leave. She… he was packing up the stuff he had pulled out of his bag, joking with his girlfriends. Realising he was about to lose his shot with this newly-minted twunk, Dan excused himself and headed over to their group. <br />
<br />
He felt his face slip into Rhys’s winning smile as he approached him and he said: “hey, I couldn’t help noticing you move just now – you’re really good.”<br />
<br />
The guy blushed in a shy, surprisingly feminine way. “Thanks.”<br />
<br />
“I know this sounds really forward, but would it be possible for me to take you for a coffee some time?”<br />
<br />
The former girl blushed even harder, then said: “yes, sounds great.”<br />
<br />
The pair exchanged numbers, and Dan turned back, happy he’d got a date for the weekend – the guy he’d created was cute and he was looking forward to exploring his new form. <br />
<br />
He headed back towards Zach and Lucy, and was pleased to notice that it was now Lucy stroking Zach’s thigh, excruciatingly close to his disappointing crotch, even slipping a finger inside the leg of his speedos. Dan thought that was the sign he was looking for – he’d changed the dynamics of their relationship. He looked forward to seeing how it would play out, and what else he could do to mess with them.</p>
