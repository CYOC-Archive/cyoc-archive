<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still somewhat groggy from waking up to the reality that you now found yourself in, you sit there in disbelief, rubbing your eyes, the sweet stink of your father&#39;s musk permeating the air and your nose. The aroma wasn&#39;t displeasing, considering you weren&#39;t into musk, but there was something else present there... a scent you were all too familiar with and loved... piss. It smelled of thick, pungent piss like your father had marked every inch of the place and the only thing that didn&#39;t smell like his piss was you, but something told you that wasn&#39;t going to be the case for very long. As you sat there, taking in the sight before you, you couldn&#39;t help get a chubby going staring at the man... no the beast... sitting there with his soda can thick chubby dripping copious amounts of precum into the coffee. Your father had always been a thick, burly, muscle bear of a man and as far back as you could remember, you always wondered how it was possible he didn&#39;t work out a day in his life, but still had that physique. Well... the answer was sitting there, staring at you with a sly grin planted on his muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-dad?! B-but h-how... when?!&quot; You asked, stammering, the smells in the room not helping you to think straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... let&#39;s see, as for the when... after your mother was pregnant with you all those years ago. As for the how, well... you&#39;re about to find out!&quot; He said with a grin, &quot;Fuck I need to piss!&quot; He bellowed. &quot;All this teasing of my dick has gone on for far too long waiting for you to wake up, and now my bladder is killing me. Bet you want daddy&#39;s piss, don&#39;t you pup?&quot; He asked with an even more evil and sadistic grin. &quot;Oh yeah... I know all about your fantasy boy... your little narc friend that wanted you to see reason after you confessed to him during your drunken night out last night told me all about it. Well... sadly for him, not only was I willing to oblige... I have been desperately waiting and hoping for this night to come. In fact... I have your little narc friend down in the basement, waiting for us both after I make you into a proper creature of the night, and we will both share with him the love for golden showers and cum!&quot; He said with a monstrous growl that made your cock twitch and jump.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t help it... you loved watersports, golden showers, being used as a urinal and the like... not only that, you loved the thought of incest between a real father and real son... along with monsters. That genie, as the memory of its existence was quickly fading must&#39;ve known your most intimate and darkest secrets. In fact, what was a memory was now gone and the reality that your werewolf father wove about what happened last night was the only truth you knew. As your memory came back from last night, you remembered the bender you were on with Christopher and confessing how you were gay, loved werewolves, loved watersports and the like as your face grew red hot from the embarrassment that you opened up to him. You thought you could trust him, you thought you could confide in him, but little did he know his trying to help you backfired and got him in a bit of trouble for being a narc in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do with Christopher, dad?&quot; You asked, licking your lips, hoping he&#39;d say something monstrous and evil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirsty pup?&quot; He asked with a knowing grin, &quot;Want a taste of daddy&#39;s piss, doncha boy?&quot; He said, grunting as he stood up, setting the coffee down and gently playing with his cock. &quot;Or... do you want me to rape you, forcing my piss on you? Yeah... he told me you wanted your father to rape you in one of your fantasies... really fucking hot if you ask me! He told me how you wanted to be a urinal for a pack of werewolves... is that true?&quot; He asked with an evil sneer, his eyes glowing sinisterly with a hellacious crimson glow. &quot;Don&#39;t lie, daddy will know if you are lying to him... I can smell it. I can smell your lust, your desire and your arousal right now. So... if you lie, there will be a change in the scent and I&#39;ll instantly know.&quot;<br />
<br />
All you could do was blush, your flesh feeling red hot from all of the blood rushing to and filling your cheeks. Silently, you nod your head yes and he just grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good pup, very good! Then you will be glad to know that I brought all of my cop buddies from work... all of which love giving naughty pups like you golden showers, but my piss... my piss is special pup. Not only is it the most pungent and acrid of all of them... it&#39;s marking piss and transformative piss. Piss that will make you into whatever I want you to be. See... I have been making monsters out of my precinct. Monsters that enjoy being monsters, being evil, taking what we want. Feasting on those we see as prey. We don&#39;t give a shit about normal human conventions because they are... well... beneath us now since we are the Apex Predators now. I know how much you love it... I could smell your arousal increasing, growing stronger and since I know you want to be a urinal for a pack... that&#39;s exactly what I am going to make you... you&#39;re going to be the pack urinal, but first...&quot; He said with a quick pause, grabbing you by your throat, his strong paw clenched against the hinge of your mandible, noticing that his pre had stopped and a droplet of amber piss clung to his thick mushroom cockhead while he forced your mouth open. &quot;Stick out your tongue for daddy!&quot; He growled, but didn&#39;t wait, using his other free hand he grabbed your tongue and pulled it out, immediately letting his piss flow onto your tongue and pooling into your mouth. The acrid, pungent fluid washed over your tongue and filled your mouth as your werewolf father monstrously clamped down just enough to force it to build, letting his urinal fill before he&#39;d allow the first flush... your first swallow... to occur. As the flow trickled off to a stop, his bladder emptied, he grinned and started to let go as you felt the piss slowly drain into your belly. &quot;Good urinal, don&#39;t waste a drop! It&#39;s not time for you to get messy yet... no... that&#39;s going to be a bit later!&quot; He said as you obeyed, drinking it down, feeling it doing things to you... rewriting your mind. The moan that you could initially feel building was fading, arousal turning to abject horror, and instead of a hot monster you thought your dad was... you now saw him as a cruel beast that you fully despised. As the piss was fully drained, you coughed and sputtered, spitting, trying to get the taste of what you now suddenly thought to be disgusting and he smelled exactly what you were going through, grinning sadistically.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted a rape fantasy where you were forced into being a urinal for a pack of werewolves, led by your monstrously evil werewolf father... how could I give you what you wanted if you liked it. No... for it to be real, your mind had to be changed, but I&#39;ll give you back what I took from you... albeit slowly... all for your wildest fantasy to come true. So... while it was a consensual rape... to make it all the more real... I had to make it non-consensual!&quot; He laughed villainously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut your fucking mouth! You&#39;re not my father... you&#39;re a monster!&quot; You spat, never in your wildest dreams did you think you&#39;d ever talk to your father like that as the old you. Now... now everything was different. You never wanted what your father just did to you. You never ever wanted to be used as a urinal, raped or anything... especially by your own father. The world you knew was gone, replaced by the instructions your father gave to your body as he thought about you and pissing into your forced open mouth.<br />
<br />
Grinning, he clasped a spiked black leather collar around your neck, with a rather thick D ring at the back with a black leather leash attached to it. &quot;Good pup! Very good! Just what I want to hear! Means what I&#39;ve thought about as my bladder drained into you is working as planned! Not that I didn&#39;t think it would... considering I&#39;ve had tons of practice, but that also means I know a willing mind can be changed into an unwilling mind. Now... let&#39;s see if the unwilling mind can be fashioned into what I want! With the guys at the precinct... none of them were truly unwilling... they had hints of the true monsters they were, just hidden away and disguised. All of them were true monsters in their own right! Some of them were pigs or rats, as the town had labeled various officers. The unlabeled ones I made into werewolves, like me, but as I turned each one, I imagined them becoming the bestial monsters they were called... and that&#39;s what they became. All of them monsters in their own right, wishing that they could be the all-powerful cops they wanted to be, making rules and laws as they saw fit, being the judge, jury and executor of what they saw fit to occur. Being what the public secretly thought about them; assholes on a power trip! Now... with my special gift, they were assholes and fully realized monsters on a power trip... one they all rightfully deserved. All of them were kink-loving fuckers that wished to make their version of a town reality. I promised them all that and more, but it first had to start with you. Little did I know your narc buddy would also get to play too. Now... it&#39;s time to make him into a perfect monster too... the hot bully you lusted over! Yeah... I know about that fantasy too... read that on your computer a long time ago when you were still in High School. Now that you&#39;re twenty-one and in college, I see no harm or foul in doing any of this to you!&quot; He explained as he forcefully led you down into the basement where Christopher was chained to the wall, the pack of werewolf cops, still in human form and in uniform stood there, seeing you and grinned evilly.<br />
<br />
Everything that your father said to you didn&#39;t make sense, none of it was true... or so you thought. There wasn&#39;t a single filthy memory like what your father said. Christopher was your best friend, a confidant and loyal friend to the end. You never saw him how your father described... or so you were made to believe.<br />
<br />
&quot;That your pup?&quot; One of the cops questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right and he&#39;s going to be our urinal... permamently!&quot; Your father said with a triumphant howl as he pressed your back against the cold cinderblocks of the basement, motioning with his lupine head for the pack to help bind you to the wall. Two cops flanked you two, one on each side, grasping the wrist cuffs attached to the wall with thick, steel chains that wouldn&#39;t budge from a human&#39;s strength... perhaps a werewolf&#39;s would do it though, but tonight wasn&#39;t going to be that test either. They each clasped one around each wrist, then squatted as they attached a shackle to each ankle for you to be restrained and not go anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm pup... you look so fuckin good like that and you&#39;re going to be one hell of a urinal when we get done with you, but for now...&quot; He said with a pause, looking toward the average built Christopher, &quot;It&#39;s time to make your buddy the bully you secretly wanted to be involved in raping you.<br />
<br />
Christopher&#39;s eyes bulged as he heard what your father said in his sinister lupine voice. &quot;No... wait... what? Y-you&#39;re evil! H-how could you do this to your own son?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sinister grin, your father chuckled, &quot;Just like how I am going to do this to you, Christopher... or should I just call you Chris? Hmm... yeah... or maybe you need a full name change for the new identity I am going to give you tonight... just... as soon... as my bladder refills. My son has had all kinds of fantasies... dark and delicious ones... I will give him that. Oh... and don&#39;t worry... the guy you knew... that you wanted me to do something about...? Well... he&#39;s shackled right next to you and he&#39;s programmed not to listen unless I am directly talking to him, isn&#39;t that right boy?!&quot; He asked, turning his head to where you were shackled as you wrenched against the chains in vain and spat in his direction. Turning his head and voice back toward Christopher, &quot;See... just what you wanted. You narced on my son, telling me all about his debauchery, thinking I&#39;d want to do something to correct that. Instead... what I did do, albeit temporarily, is correct it... but just so his true fantasies could be played out and be as real as possible. Which leads me to you. See... I knew about his fantasies a long time ago... the one involving you, being a muscle bear for a bully... that one was especially hot and I just knew that I needed to have you in my pack. You will fit perfectly in with the pigs all around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher&#39;s eyes widened, hearing that all of the men there were beasts of some sort. &quot;Wait... all of them... a-and me?&quot; Christopher whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that&#39;s right! Some are werewolves like me. Some are wereboars and a few are wererats! Perfect beasts that all love nasty, raunchy and filthy kink! Mostly of the piss and cum variety. A few are into fisting, including myself and by the end of the night... you will be too. Now... the only question is what to do with you? Should I make you into a bully boar, a bully rat or a bully wolf...?&quot; As he spoke out the kind of beast he was considering to make Christopher, he took a whiff of the air around him... each beast type getting a deep whiff of its own... just so he could know what Christopher&#39;s preference was... if there even was one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... perfect! I know what you&#39;re going to be and you&#39;re going to love it from what I can smell...&quot;</p>
