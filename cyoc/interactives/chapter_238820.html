<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Author&#39;s note; I am not the original author of the last 3 chapters, OP just made something so enticing I had to get involved in due to the absolute drought of good FTM content on this site.*<br />
<br />
It had been a week since The Kelton&#39;s received the news of Sarah&#39;s &#39;second&#39; second puberty. Now approaching the 3rd week of her transformation, the changes were beginning to manifest in Sarah both inside and out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, oh that&#39;s the goddamn spot!&quot; Sarah panted, her voice somewhat hoarse compared to her usual soft and amorous tone as she aggressively rode her husband on their damp bedsheets.<br />
<br />
Brad squirmed and moaned as his wife&#39;s ever-tighter cunt squeezed the life out of his manhood, her swollen clit sliding against the big vein at the top of his dick and being tickled by his stubbly bush.<br />
<br />
 Sarah, while initially depressed and deflated at the news was now somewhat ambivalent towards her third puberty, at least she had the drive to get up in the mornings again. Some days ago she had came to Brad, expressing a desire to really get the most out of her body before she fully transformed. Initially chalking it down to a new healthy disposition, it was clear Sarah&#39;s new testosterone levels were having a pronounced effect on her libido. Brad had lost count over the amount of times they had fucked in recent days, Sarah going so far as to get Brad to use his remaining sick days at work so that the two could constantly be together and while Brad initially had no problem catering to his wife&#39;s every little desire, he found himself now struggling to keep up physically.<br />
<br />
Sarah meanwhile was now in the best shape of her life, what little excess plump she had was now gone, her curvy body now supported by a healthy musculature that made her womanly bits all the more firm and perky (If not a tad smaller). Sarah had also subtly grown in height, stretching from 5&quot;2 to 5&quot;4 but what change she really loved was in the downstairs department, while her vaginal lips had become darker in complexion and less sensitive, her clitoris had become a hard, red orgasm button. Before Sarah had relied on her vibrator to usually achieve climax but now just a minute or two of stimulation from virtually any source was enough to curl her toes. <br />
<br />
The couple groaned and winced as their sweaty flesh slapped against each other, before a deep bellow from Brad signaled his 6th? 7th? Orgasm of the day, Sarah could feel the tiniest spurt of watery cum nestle within her now barren uterus as she continued to ride on his limping shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost there, Keep...stillll!.... AH!&quot; Sarah yelped as yet another tsunami of endorphins flooded her brain, vaginal fluid and semen trickling down Brad&#39;s pelvis. Sarah carefully slid off her husband and shimmied over to her nightstand, taking a wetwipe for herself and tossing one to Brad, who was too busy chugging from his big glass of water to notice.<br />
<br />
Sarah cleaned herself up before opening one of the windows, it was December now and bitterly cold but the two didn&#39;t care, it was practically a sauna in their bedroom. Sarah put on a pair of Brad&#39;s boxershorts (A habit she had anyway), peeling back the crumpled duvet to find Brad&#39;s before tossing it at his face before curling up in bed, wrapping her arms around her sweaty lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man I&#39;m beat.&quot; Sarah remarked, nuzzling her head into Brad&#39;s neck, he readjusted himself to have one arm around her upper back and another around her bubble butt. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what shall we do tomorrow?&quot; Brad asked somewhat rhetorically. Sarah smirked, rolling her eyes before darting up to face her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Youuuu mister, are gonna do whatever I tell you to. After all I&#39;m not gonna have this goddess body for much longer.&quot; Sarah said seductively as she pressed her bountiful chest into Brad&#39;s ribs. The two talked some more before quickly nodding off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Brad awoke to a nub pressing against the small of his back, he jerked around to see Sarah sound asleep, sometime in the night having taken on the role of big spoon. He carefully crawled out of bed as to not wake her, closing the open window and heading for the shower. Sarah awoke as the low hum begun emanating from the bathroom. Sarah stretched and yawned, feeling her muscles flex and bones crack, she headed to the mirror and checked herself out. As the doctor had explained most of the transforming will be done during sleep, for Brad it was like waking up to a slightly different wife each morning. <br />
<br />
Sarah was now 5&quot;5, had a noticeable bump above her cameltoe and her musculature had further grown, she turned to see her ass had shrunk noticeably for the umpteenth night in a row. Frowning, while it was still big it wouldn&#39;t be long before it became unremarkable. Her back muscles however made her smirk, there was clear definition in them now to the point where they looked almost manly. She flexed her arms and shoulders, giggling as the muscles rippled. She also noticed her hips were slightly narrower and her feet were definitely a size up now. Before hopping in the shower she turned on the camera and tripod, taking full-body images of her front, back and side profile, something she had been asked to do daily by the doctors who had increasingly taken an interest in her case as word spread around the medical community. Sarah looked at the images and smiled, she wasn&#39;t beginning to enjoy this.... Was she?</p>
