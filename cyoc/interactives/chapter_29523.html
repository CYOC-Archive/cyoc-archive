<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Deck stood there for a moment, not really sure of what he should do or say. His head was swimming as Deck never had so many mixed and strong emotions before. Deck was extremely happy that he had found Brad, especially being that he was a werewolf... but that thought somewhat scared Deck. It would be a new life, a new body that Deck would have to get used to. Being a werewolf or a Lupin did have it's advantages. Deck would be able to look how he had always dreamed of, he would never get sick, nor would he ever age... and then a thought crossed Deck's mind.</br>
<br>"Hey Brad, how old are you exactly? I mean, I know werewolves don't age, get sick or die... so you could be any age!"</br>
<br>"That is a very good question and there is a simple answer. As you mentioned, we don't age as aging is a result of the body decaying or dying. I am chronologically twenty-five years old, but as a Lupin, I can make myself look any age as a human... which if you like, I can show you later."</br>
<br>"That is pretty interesting and cool, to think Lupins are able to look how they want!"</br>
<br>"Well... I am ready to give you my answer, but I want you to be aware of something before I do."</br>
<br>"Ok buddy, go ahead and send it my way."</br>
<br>"I am very afraid right now, as from this point on, nothing will be how I knew it to be before. I'd also like to say, that from the moment I laid eyes on you, I thought you were attractive... hot even, and..." Deck lowers his head, blushing and shuffles his feet side to side. "I had a crush on you..."</br>
<br>Brad, still in his slightly transformed state walked up to Deck, resting his chest right against Deck's, stepped back a bit to look Deck directly in the eyes, then placing a clawed finger under Deck's chin and raised his head to look at Brad. Brad could tell that there was a bit of shame in him, which was totally not what Brad had intended. As Deck began to feel at ease once more, where Brad no longer had to hold Deck's head from dropping, Brad smiled a wolfish and toothy grin. With a partial wolven muzzle, Brad pecked Deck on the lips, winked and then stepped back once more.</br>
<br>"Hey buddy, you needn't worry yourself about that. It is totally normal and had I known that a bit earlier, we might have started this process when we first met. However, for things to continue, I need to hear an answer from you. Do you accept my offer or not?"</br>
<br>There was a tremor in his voice and Brad could see a small tear form in the corner of Deck's eye. "Yes, I accept your offer. There is nothing else in this world that I would love more than being your Lupin mate!"</br>
<br>Brad rushed toward Deck and held him tightly in a mutual embrace. For a split second within the fast paced current time followed, it seemed to slow down and allow them to share that special moment together. As they released their grasp from one another, Brad stepped back and winked.</br>
<br>"Alright bud, this is the moment you have probably been waiting for, for a while now, ever since you laid eyes on me!"</br>
<br>At first, Deck didn't really know what he meant, but Deck had a very good idea. Brad extended his right furred hand, closing his fingers slightly as a clawed look, and swiped across his chest, from one arm sleeve to the other, slicing his clothes into shreds. Deck smiled widely as he saw Brad's exposed chest. Each one of Brad's pectoral muscles were nice and round, his nipples were small, taught and erect, with even a perfectly formed bread basket. What was even more appealing to Deck was the slightly hairy, but short trimmed black hairs that laid down flat, giving more definition and contour to his manly chest. Deck almost started to drool, but became transfixed as his eyes moved down to Brad's abdominals which were nicely chiseled chasms of sinewed muscles, with a shallow navel. Brad's six pack was also lightly covered in hair which shared the condition of Brad's chest. Brad used both hands, clawing down the length of his pants, slicing from the waist down to the already exposed portion of his legs. While the slices were being made, the cloth spread open which released the tension on his other trapped muscles.</br>
<br>Brad paused for a second, looking at Deck and watching him stare in awe. In Brad's mind, he thought: <i>all of this will soon be yours Deck and then together, we will own the night!</i></br>
<br>Brad smiled his toothy grin, knowing this last part was the <i>coupe de gras</i> while Deck watched on intently. Deck's eyes went wide as he could have sworn it had just grown slightly when blood pulsed through it upon his gaze. Brad started to remove the tight boxer/briefs but stopped short as Deck walked up to Brad now, and placed his hands on the tight fabric. Brad shivered slightly at Deck's light and silken touch, making his member twitch and grow once more.</br>
<br>Brad growled deep within his chest, signifying that what Deck was doing was extremely pleasurable and wanted. Brad knew that he needed this to stop, even though he didn't want it to end, it would have to, to insure Deck's change was complete, and that Deck would turn out to be just like him. Brad, hesitantly, grasped Deck's hands and placed them atop one another, and while returning his own to their resting position, he held his pointer finger out while swishing it side to side. "I know that is something that you would like to do, but we have to wait... otherwise you may not turn out to be completely Lupin like myself and the others here."</br>
<br>Deck wanted to bow his head again in shame, but he didn't because he knew Brad wasn't scolding him, he was just making sure that all would turn out to be the best.</br>
<br>With Deck subdued for the moment, Brad continued with what he had been doing, and grasped the edge of his boxer/briefs. This was something he could have fun with, both being sensual and erotic while teasing Deck, forcing him to wait and see what was exposed at Brad's leisurely discretion. Slowly he pulled down the undies, exposing inch by inch of sensual and alluring skin. Deck watched as Brad exposed more and more of himself slowly, taking note of each line of detail. Deck could feel the stirring within his own pants, getting harder and tighter, becoming more and more restrictive. Deck could see the line of separation of Brad's thighs and pelvic divide. Deck's eyes quickly went back to the center of attention as Brad slightly lowered the rim of his boxer/briefs. Deck could see the cusp of where Brad's seemingly massive shaft jutted from his pelvis. Then as quickly as you could blink, Brad removed the fabric, revealing the member and allowing the boxer/briefs to fall to the floor below. Deck's eyes widened bigger than he had ever thought possible. Brad's cock was completely human in shape, it was eight inches long, with a girth the size of a coke can, circumcised and has a huge mushroom head which matched the girth. Brad's human testicles were an impressive size, being as big as marble mashers, the attacking piece in the game of marbles. Deck smiled and licked his lips both hungrily and lusciously and Brad knew what Deck wanted.</br>
<br>Brad chuckled deeply, then went silent just as quickly. Now that he was completely free of all his previous confines, Brad was ready to complete his transformation. A low growl emanated from deep within his chest and then Deck saw it, Brad had resumed his transformation. Brad's muscles twitched, bulging out even more everywhere on his body, his bones snapped and cracked, making him twitch and convulse slightly. His fingers and hands became thicker, meatier and coarse, forming thick pads on his palms. His nails blackened as deep and dark as the starless night, lengthening and curling while coming to a point. While his hands changed, his feet followed in suit, but now he stood on the balls, instead of his heels, like a human. His face continued pushing out, forming a wolven muzzle, while his eyes turned a golden yellow where the whites had been and green as the summer's grass where the blue hue of the day sky, as at the same time his ears moved to the top of his head, coming to a triangular point. Brad howled out as two things happened simultaneously. His tail popped out from the base of his spine, lengthy and fluffy, touching the center of his back. His cock had grown even larger, now it was still human in shape but ten inches long and had added yet another half a coke can. His balls had grown even larger, previously being the size of marble mashers, now they were the size of baseballs.</br>
<br>Brad stood there, panting and breathing heavily and Deck could hear his deeper voice just through his breathing. There, before Deck, stood the massive werewolf covered in jet black and coarse fur. Every last bit of Brad's body was covered in the fur, except his huge cock which remained a beige, or Caucasian male's flesh tone and the head was a bit darker with a tinge of red from all of the added blood flow.</br>
<br>"Do you like what you see of me now?" Brad had asked in his deeper voice.</br>
<br>Deck didn't utter a single word as he walked up to Brad, dropped to his knees and licked at the mushroom head, covered in slick precum. Brad's lips pulled back in a wolven smile, knowing that was his response and it was a good one at that.</br>
<br>"Well... I guess that answers my question. So Deck, do you like how that tastes?"</br>
<br>Deck smiled wide, from ear to ear. "Oh yes, that tasted so good!"</br>
<br>Brad chuckled again, this time a bit lustfully. "Well then, maybe you will like this then..."</br></p>
