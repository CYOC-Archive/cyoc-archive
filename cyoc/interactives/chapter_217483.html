<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I followed my boyfriend into the gym, admiring his rippling back.<br />
<br />
Everything felt a bit off. I checked the book and couldn’t see what was wrong. I’d changed Josh into an anthro like myself, of course. He’d always been hung like a horse and now he really was! I chuckled dumbly at my own joke. <br />
<br />
Josh turned his handsome head, eyebrows raised.<br />
<br />
“Laughing to yourself again, beau?” Josh grinned.<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
“Was it a good joke?”<br />
<br />
I shrugged. “Ya wouldn’t get it, Josh.”<br />
<br />
Josh tossed his magnificent dusty gold mane and shook his head. “Good thing ya got in on a football scholarship, hoss. Don’t think you woulda gotten in any other way.”<br />
<br />
“Mean.” I grinned, slapping his muscular ass.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get me hot ‘n bothered again,” Josh warned, adjusting his crotch before reaching over and ruffling my tousled headfur. “Ya big ole’ heifer you.”<br />
<br />
We clopped across campus to the gym.<br />
<br />
The sun was shining and the sidewalks radiated the heat of the day. My hooves absorbed most of the heat, but I could feel it. There was a nice breeze and the wildflowers that were planted along the sides of the old brick buildings carried with them a pleasant scent. It reminded me of home.<br />
<br />
There were other students, all human, that we walked past.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, no one seemed to care that Josh was now an anthro stallion. We both still got looks, some of admiration at our huge forms-to which, of course, we flexed and winked, making the observer scurry away blushing-and others looked at us in fascination or disgust. I’d gotten used to it. Being a bullman in a human world was like that sometimes.<br />
<br />
Finally, we reached the gym, the huge building a towering edifice of health and strength. <br />
<br />
Just seeing it made me giddy. Sometimes me and Josh would find a hot-looking human and imagine them as anthros… I paused, shaking my head. That wasn’t… Josh had only just been turned into an anthro, so it was impossible… Mrooo! These reality changes were so confusing to a bull-head like me!<br />
<br />
We walked through the doors and my fur lifted as the air conditioning cooled the sweat that had dampened my hide. I paused to bask in the cool air and looked around.<br />
<br />
Every time I entered this place, I marveled at just how many weight machines there were. Back on the farm, all I had to lift was sacks of feed and hay bales. Josh lived on the ranch across the way from where I worked, and he had a small weight bench, but both of us outgrew the few weights he could find. The gym on campus was big and mostly empty. For now, at least. At this hour, most students were in classes. There only five people using it. In the next room, I could see a gym class had taken over the basketball court for the next hour. <br />
<br />
“C’mon, hoss! The squat machines are over here!” Josh said excitedly. “Ain’t no one using it but us!”<br />
<br />
I grinned back and we hurried over to the machine, piling on the weight. <br />
<br />
Working out felt oddly novel, like it was the first time I was stretching these muscles. Which was silly, I’d basically always had them ever since Josh and I pooled our money together for more weights. Of course, steroids for anthros weren’t against FDA regulations, so it didn’t take long for us to get this big. That and our natural proclivity to pack on the muscle.<br />
<br />
I snorted in confusion, realizing that memory was probably also real. Mrooo! How annoying!<br />
<br />
“Get yer head in the game, Kevin!” Josh snapped, pulling me from my reverie. “Those horns screwed on too tight?”<br />
<br />
“Mrrooo! My bad!” I lowed in shame, getting back into my groove.<br />
<br />
“Gotta keep those glutes nice and round, heifer!” Josh smirked.<br />
<br />
My cock stirred in my sheathe. “Y-yeah!”<br />
<br />
Josh’s hooflets caressed my round asscheeks, giving my buns a squeeze. I squirmed and blushed. The stallion nuzzled my muscular neck. I leaned back into him, enjoying the firmness of his muscular body.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, darlin’.” Josh gave me ass another squeeze before slapping it. “Now hurry up and do your reps!”<br />
<br />
The next twenty minutes were grueling. My muscles burned and ached, my hide lathered with sweat. The entire time, Josh was there, shouting encouragement.<br />
<br />
“Almost done! Just one more, hoss!” Josh said. <br />
<br />
My butt and thighs were burning and my back was sore. Josh had made me do another ten reps at my highest weight limit. With a heaving grunt, I squatted and shook, forcing the last bit of energy I had and lifted the barbell over my head before gently sitting the weight back into place.<br />
<br />
Then it was Josh’s turn. The stallion took to the weight with gusto. Despite having been transformed into a naturally muscular stallion, it had done nothing to lessen his efforts in the gym. Nor,apparently, his expectations of me…<br />
<br />
I settled back against the wall and winced as my aching butt touched it. That was going to hurt in the morning. I sighed and pulled out a protein shake and began slurping it. Alfalfa flavored, mmmm! Now that I wasn’t actively working out, I became acutely aware of the musky barnyard scent my sweat-soaked clothes were emitting and the furnace of heat my body was giving off.<br />
<br />
The stench was only driven out by the air conditioning and air fresheners.<br />
<br />
Shifting my position again, I groaned, my legs feeling rubbery. Maybe I’d gone too hard today and injured myself. Josh would probably tell me to man up and endure the pain. It just meant my muscles were growing. <br />
<br />
I flicked my tasseled tail and watched as Josh easily pounded out his reps. <br />
<br />
My mind began to wander. That nagging feeling of something being off was still there, but when I double-checked my book, I didn’t see how anything could be out of place. <br />
<br />
With a snort, I shook my head, trying to take my mind off of the weird existential dread I was experiencing. Josh would be fine for the first ten minutes before he needed a spotter. I let my gaze travel across the gym at the other students. <br />
<br />
There were four people here that I could see.<br />
<br />
On the treadmill was a fat blonde girl, her cheeks splotchy and red. Sweat trickled from her head as she huffed and puffed. Her body swayed to and fro with every step she made. I didn’t have a problem with a fat chick using the treadmill, in fact, I was happy for her and kinda proud that she had the confidence to come to the gym at all.<br />
<br />
What did kinda make me gag was the pink yoga pants she was wearing, showing off her cottage-cheese legs, with ‘JUICY’ in bold letters across her lumpy ass. It was not flattering at all.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the next gym-goer, I watched a thin, nerdy dweeb struggling to lift the metal bar. Like, JUST the bar, no weights. He was wearing jeans and a button-down, definitely not appropriate workout attire. Again, I was happy he was starting out, but his form was completely wrong, his hands either too far apart or, when his arms got sore, too close together. <br />
<br />
That, more than anything else, set me off. I wanted to go over and tell him what he was doing wrong and how he could improve. But I’d already done that to someone here once. He had taken my advice as insults and he reported me for harassment. Way too embarrassing for me to make the same mistake twice.<br />
<br />
I held in my indignation at the young man’s lack of form and turned to look at the last two people. They were both dudes, and if the logo on their shirts were any indication, from a frat. I didn’t recognize them, so they weren’t on the football team.<br />
<br />
They were lifting weights, goofing off. No respect at all for the gym equipment. They slammed the barbells down and grunted loudly, piling on way more weight than was safe. Every pump was met with loud exclamations from the other.<br />
<br />
Across the gym, I could see the gym class playing basketball through plexiglass windows. The gym teacher was the Assistant Coach of the football team, Coach Adams. Coach Adams was one of those guys who kinda of gave up after college. His appearance was sloppy and lazy. He was even growing a gut and had let his hair grow out and hadn’t bothered shaving. <br />
<br />
None of them appeared interested in a horseman working out, so I guessed Josh’s appearance was now normal in this reality. Small blessings, I guess. I took out my book and considered writing something down.</p>
