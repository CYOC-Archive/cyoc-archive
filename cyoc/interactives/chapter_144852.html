<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick&#39;s hunger hit him like a ton of bricks.  Between his transformation and the sexual escapade with the cow he didn&#39;t realize how hungry he had become.  While the other &quot;Bull&quot; poured the wine he began to eat the food from the tray with abandon.  It seemed the more he ate the more he hungered for everything before him.  His companion chuckled as he watched him clean the tray in minutes gulping down the sweet red wine as glass after glass was offered to him and still it didn&#39;t seem like enough.  The thought that as a teenager he had never tasted alcohol or that as much as he was drinking it didn&#39;t seem to make him drunk.  The wine had a clean sweet taste leaving him refreshed and invigorated.   <br />
<br />
Minutes later he looked down at the empty tray,  he began licking his fingers and face with his large bovine tongue sweeping the remnants of food from his hands and muzzle.  Suddenly he let out a belch of such magnitude that the sound reverberated throughout the suite and out into the night air.  Guests and employees in other rooms had to have surely heard his emission.  Derrick looked at Bull feeling a moment of embarrassment but quickly followed by a wave of pride;  pride of being a strong confident minotaur.  <br />
<br />
Silence followed between the two minotaurs as they looked at each other Derrick not knowing what to say.  A few moments later;  &quot;Jeff ..... my name is Jeff&quot;.  Derrick&#39;s eyes widen, it didn&#39;t occur to him that any of his fellow brothers had real names.  &quot;I&#39;m  a grad student working on my master thesis in Greek history and mythology&quot;.  Derrick continue to stare at the male as he continued to tell him who he was and why he was working at the resort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last year at university my professor told me of a place where I could work and learn first hand on what is was like to experience the lives of Greek Mythics by becoming one. At first I thought he was joking but it seems I wasn&#39;t the first grad student he had taught that had a chance to do the same thing.  I still wasn&#39;t convinced but after meeting with one of his prior students, who showed me by way of photographs and videos of his first hand experiences of being a centaur I was finally able to wrap my mind around it and sign on&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;After a few phone calls and e-mails I was on my way to Greece getting a chance of a lifetime to not only study history but to live it&quot;  I arrived on the island right after Memorial day week end.  I was met by a Mr. Onassis the GM for the resort.  He went over the duties I was to perform as an employee, how the transformation process would work and all the other legal and employment forms everyone has to sign when starting a new job&quot;.  Derrick was having a hard time processing all this information, it didn&#39;t help that he was suddenly feeling very tired and sleepy, barely keeping his eyes open.  Jeff notice this and said; &quot; Listen, you&#39;ve had a long day, why don&#39;t we call it a night.  I&#39;ll explain the rest of it tomorrow when you&#39;re feeling rested and more alert.  I have the next two days off and since you are newly changed and a guest of the resort the boss entrusted you&#39;re care and well being to me.  It will give you a chance to get used to you&#39;re new body and  I&#39;ll assist you with instructions on how to be a proper minotaur around the other guests&quot;.  Derrick nodded his head his eyelids heavy with exhaustion.  &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you cleaned up then you and I can get a good night&#39;s rest.  Derrick slightly turning his torso looking at the only bed in the room, the one he was sitting on.  He thought, are we going to share the same bed?  He began to feel a little uneasy but the thought fell away as quickly as it came. Well why wouldn&#39;t we, we&#39;re brothers after all and the bed is more than big enough to accommodate the two of them<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up moving the small table out of the way and reaching down began to pull the other minotaur to his feet.  Slowly he helped Derrick over to the bathroom.  Jeff asked him if he needed to relieve himself, he slowly nodded yes.  Jeff untied his loincloth with one hand and with the other positioned him in front of the toilet.  Derrick looked down and finally notice his sheath.  It looked like a long hairy tube that ran from just above his testes to just below his navel.  It was covered in dark brown fur that was longer than the surrounding fur and ran the full length of the tube.  The tube was attached to his lower abdomen.  Finally he noticed the tip of his penis had pushed out from the end of the tube.  It kind of reminded him of the genitals male dogs had. <br />
<br />
As he stood there he wondered how was he going to pee with his bullcock tucked up inside this furry tube.  Without warning the need to pee washed over him and like a switch that had been flipped, his thick pink manhood began to elongate and slide out of its cozy home.  Derrick looked on as inch after inch of flaccid bull penis began to drop down between his massive tree stump legs ready to release its load of piss.  Up to now he hadn&#39;t really taken a close look at his new equipment.  The shape was very different than his human penis, the color was a muted pink and the tip tapering to a slight point, the piss slit so much larger than his old one.  His eyes widen a bit as his manhood moved farther and farther down his legs ending up almost to his knees at 18 inches, surely it was a choker being 8 inches around at the base.  With Jeff standing behind him keeping him steady having by now placed both his hands on Derrick&#39;s hips making sure he didn&#39;t fall. Derrick grabbed his dick in both hands amazed at how thick it really was.  It felt warm in his large furry palms and he could actually feel it throb from the blood moving into the shaft tied to his heartbeat.  The pink skin felt smooth and silky to the touch with a bit of fluid coating the skin, the smell was musky and woodsey and very intoxicating.  He closed his eyes just standing there reveling in the moment, his heighten senses allowing him to feel and smell so much more then when he was human.<br />
<br />
Without warning he could feel the flow of urine move up his long shaft and like a dam breaking flow out of its tip rushing like a waterfall into the basin.  That utter feeling of release on his bladder was so much more intense then he had ever experienced before.  A lowing sound came from his throat as gallons of bull piss filled the toilet.  After several minutes the rush turned to a trickle as the last of his pee left his body.  He lightly squeezed his lemon sized balls noting again how they too had grown larger and were encased in a black leather like skin and using the palm of his hand pushed the last of his piss out of his body and into the toilet.<br />
<br />
Jeff learned in and spoke quietly into his ear &quot;that was a real stud size release you had, it made me hot just watching it&quot;.  Somehow the comment didn&#39;t seem out of place to Derrick.  Even though he knew he was straight he didn&#39;t think it odd that another sexy bull like him standing close enough to him that the other bull&#39;s junk was pressing up against his backside, hands on his hips, feeling his hot breath on his neck.<br />
<br />
Jeff then stepped back removing his hands from his hips.  The absence of his warm body against his back caused Derrick to become more aware of his surroundings.  He turned to face Jeff.  Jeff&#39;s hand reaching out to him, mentally telling him to come with him.  Derrick tentatively took his hand and began to walk with him to the area of the bathroom where the large shower was located.  This simple action, his hand in another males was something he had never felt, sure he held his dad&#39;s hand many times as a little boy but this was different.  This was the hand of a strong virile male, one that happened to be a seven foot muscle god sporting horns and a tail with a bull sized penis.<br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s thoughts again became muddled.  Why was he having these thoughts.  He liked girls.  He found the soft curves of the female anatomy sexy.  And breasts, man nothing beat breasts.  Just last Christmas at a party he had attended he was able to get Mary Jane Anderson alone.  There in her parents guest bedroom after a few minutes of heavy petting he got to &quot;cop a feel&quot; for the first time.<br />
<br />
As his mental state returned to the present he found himself standing just outside of the shower.  To his left was a full floor to ceiling mirror.  It was here he was able to see himself for the first time in all of its bovine glory.   At first he couldn&#39;t fully comprehend that what he was seeing was actually real.  The reflection showed a massive muscled dark brown furred god.  Blinding white horns pushing out from both sides of his forehead, slightly curving out and then forward measuring at least two feet in length.  These appendages adding weight and girth to the feel of his head but with a bigger and stronger neck and trap muscles it felt so very normal.  This particular attribute somehow made him feel very masculine and proud.  He wasn&#39;t sure why it just did.   His noticed his ears were now leaf shaped, his hearing not only sharper but he could move them around based on the direction of the sounds he heard.   <br />
<br />
His eyes then moved to the shape of his head and face. At first they looked fully bovine but upon closer inspection the shape of his skull was a little more human in shape as was his eye socket placement and the color of them still the soft green he had as a human.  He had a strip of different colored fur above each eye which still gave him the semblance of eye brows.  His muzzle wasn&#39;t quite as long as a feral cow as he begun to make &quot;faces&quot; to his reflection.  He could still raise his &quot;eyebrows&quot;, still stretch his mouth into a smile.  He could still show all the emotions that his old human face could show.  He delighted in still having this &quot;human&quot; ability.  He then opened his muzzle wide to inspect his mouth.  His teeth were bigger, thicker and more blocky in shape.  He mentally smiled that they still retained their dazzling white color.  He then stuck his tongue out surprised at how think and long it was, it was a wonder he could still speak without an impediment.  He practiced seeing how far he could stretch it.  It&#39;s length allowed him to more than touch the bridge of his nose several inches above his nostrils, then out to the sides well past his lips and down past his chin.  The color reminded him of pink cotton candy.<br />
<br />
Moving on Derrick began exploring his body.  Even at 7 feet tall he couldn&#39;t believe that much muscle could be packed onto his frame.  He had to weigh somewhere north of 500 pounds but with so little body fat it made his body appear even bigger.  The deepness of his muscles caused major shadows to fall across his torso from the overhead lighting.  His chest so deep you could hide a submarine in it.  He brought his hands to his large hard nipples, squeezing them brought a hiss of pleasure to his throat.  Next he slid each hand to the opposite side of his body sliding them up and down his swollen delts and arms.  Even though he sported a coat of fur you could still see veins criss crossing all over his arms and torso, the rich brown coat did nothing to hide his amazing definition.   All his life Derrick wanted to have a six pack but could never get lean enough to see them but due to his new thicker muscles, leaner body and height he not only had a six pack he was now sporting an eight pack!  He did crunching movements watching as his serratus and intercostal muscles popped with power.  Moving on he again relished the site of his large package.  With his exploration of his body it made his manhood stiffen and fill with blood.  Watching it slide slowly out of its sheath really made him horny.  For now he suppressed his urges so he could continue with his self exploration of his new body.  He continued southward admiring his massive quads and calves.  Their size belying  the amount of power they contained.  Turning slightly he could see that his hamstrings were more than up to the task of being a mirror image of his quads.  He now got a clear view of how massive his calves were.  Bigger and thicker than most humans legs they complimented the rest of his lower body.  He know turned to his feet, well not feet anymore.  In their place stood a pair of hooves of titanic proportions.  They were the size of dinner plates. <br />
 Shiny and black with a slight split up the front, and just above them fetlocks flowing down from his ankles slightly obscuring them, they gave Derrick the ability to stand, walk and run with utter confidence.  Even with his new stance he was adapting quickly to it and found walking to be almost normal.   Turning around to face away from the mirror he gasped as his thick wide back made its appearance.  He now sported and insane v taper.  It made his waist look almost waspish, the curves and valleys showing how strong he really was. Now onto his new and improved ass.  And what an ass it was, fulsom of muscle jutting out from his backside sitting high and proud like the prow of a ship.  He placed his hands on each buttocks and found them to be hard and firm.  Just above his ass flowing out and away from his body was his tail.  Covered in fur it was was three feet in length ending with a puff of long hairs.  It reminded him of the tails of lions he had seen on tv while watching the nature channel.  It felt so odd but so normal to have this appendage attached to his back side.  With very little mental input he found he could move it in any direction he wanted.  It felt a bit strange but again like other parts of his new anatomy it was beginning to feel normal.  With its placement being just above his ass cheeks it caused them to be pushed slightly apart exposing his black leathery anus.  <br />
<br />
Derrick had been so engrossed in exploring his new and improve body he didn&#39;t notice another image appearing in the mirror.  The sight of Jeff moving up to stand next to him caught him off guard.  Even though Jeff was a mirror copy of him with his new thought patterns he felt the mental differences between the two of them.  He knew that this was Jeff and he was Derrick, not just two Bulls looking and acting the same.  He knew with just a thought he could still tap into the minotaur mind stream and become one with the herd but for now it was just the two of them there and now, in the moment.<br />
<br />
There was look in Jeff&#39;s eyes as they moved up and down taking in Derrick&#39;s image in the mirror.  His face had an almost hungry look to it, a look of a predator stalking it&#39;s prey.  Without warning Jeff moved between Derrick and the mirror.  He brought his hands and placed them on both sides of his head.  Leaning in Jeff pressed his lips to his demanding entrance to his mouth.  Derrick began to panic, not knowing what to do.  He liked Jeff, in the short time that had been together he was really enjoying his company.  But this, he didn&#39;t know what he should do.  His first thought was to pull back, away from Jeff but his strong grip was keeping him from doing so.  His eyes darting back in forth in panic, trying not to make eye contact with the other minotaur.  <br />
<br />
Jeff for his part stayed calm and serene.   This wasn&#39;t his first rodeo and his growing passion for his new brother was nothing like he had ever experienced before.  He could see the panic in Derrick&#39;s face.  The fact that his brain was fighting his new urges was completely normal.  He remembered back a few months ago after his change the GM Mr. Onassis telling him that part of the change was that he would begin having gay thoughts about other males.  It had to do with all minotaurs by nature were bi sexual.  Sure they would lie with women when the opportunity would arise but when that wasn&#39;t an option they found no qualms with having sex with one another.  It was common fact that they preferred the company of other bulls.  Who else could really quince their thirst for raw masculine animal sex, add to the fact that the only way to make another minotaur was to have sex with a male human and transform them into one.<br />
<br />
Jeff finally pulled his lips from Derricks muzzle.  In a low soft voice he said:  &quot;I know this is not something you expected and I didn&#39;t want to scare you or make you feel uncomfortable.  I only wanted to show you the pleasures of being a minotaur.  From the moment of your change I found you to be exceptionally beautiful both in body and spirit.  I felt a connection that I&#39;ve never felt with anyone else.  You are truly unique in this world and you so much want to give to others&quot;.<br />
<br />
With that Jeff removed his hands from Derrick&#39;s head, stepping back from him and began to leave the room.  Derrick stood there his mind still spinning with what just transpire just moments ago.  As his mental state relaxed so did his body.  He looked into the mirror and what he saw shocked him.  There, at total attention was his manhood.  All 18 inches of thick pink throbbing bull cock.  He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes.  Was he on some subconscious level getting turned on from Jeff&#39;s advances.   All of this was becoming too much for Derrick.  On one hand he always knew he was straight.  Sure he could admire a great male body but that had more to do with wanting to have one like it not wanting to be with the person who had it.<br />
<br />
Now Derrick was feeling bad.  Bad that he made his new friend unhappy.  Bad that he felt like a jerk for doing it.  Bad that now he might be alone in his new condition and not having someone there to guide him through it. Suddenly Derrick knew he had to make things right.  He hurried out of bathroom so he could find Jeff and tell him how sorry he was for not being more understanding about his feelings.  As he rounded the corner into the living room he almost bowled Jeff over.  Jeff had been removing the empty food tray and pitcher to return them to the kitchen area of the suite.  Derrick was still sporting his major hard on when he knocked Jeff onto his stomach causing the tray and pitcher to fly farther into the room.  Derrick&#39;s penis slid up Jeff&#39;s ass sliding between his cheeks stopping at his lower back.  Besides being stunned by having a 500 pound steer run you over and knocking the wind out of you he was more surprised at the image of his brother looking down at him with a panicked look on his face.  &quot;Oh Jeff I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t hurt you did I?  I was coming to tell you how sorry I was with the way I acted.  I know you didn&#39;t mean to scare or hurt me but it all came about so suddenly I didn&#39;t have a chance to process it in my mind and my first reaction was to try and run away.  Can you ever forgive me&quot;?  I didn&#39;t m....  Enough!!! said the other bull.   <br />
<br />
Jeff just laid there trying to process what had just happened.  Here he was sprawled out prone on the floor with a sexy bull lying on top of him, his bull cock leaking pre all over his lower back fusley apologizing for something that wasn&#39;t even his fault.  Finally a crooked smile broke out on his face.  Turning his head to look at the other bull, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, you get your fat ass off of me and I&#39;ll show you where you can really put that dick to good use&quot;.  Derrick gazed at the face of his brother.  Slowly a broad smile began to sweep across his face.</p>
