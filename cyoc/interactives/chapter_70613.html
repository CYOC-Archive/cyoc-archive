<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Five hours.<br />
Twenty nine minutes.<br />
Fifty six seconds.<br />
<br />
Luis took slow, shallow breaths from his perch at the top of the bleachers. With each inhale however he felt <br />
he was only being tainted <br />
more by the sprawling jungle around him, the jungle these beasts called high school. He released the air in an <br />
angry puff as he scribbled <br />
furiously in his strange little book.  Writing as if no one and nothing else existed.  Imagining the world <br />
away.<br />
<br />
Five hours.<br />
Twenty nine minutes.<br />
Fifty three seconds.<br />
<br />
He counted down the time as he wrote. Home was little better but it was quiet and calm, like a short reprieve <br />
while his invisible tormentor <br />
took a break to piss. Some days it felt like the world was out to get him.  Luis was a freshman, perhaps <br />
smaller and scrawnier than your average freshman and definitely weirder. He <br />
lacked a crowd to call his own, being a bit of a social mutt. He wore skinny jeans and scene band shirts like <br />
Asking Alexandria and a few bracelets but still never made it in <br />
with that crowd because of his general... creepiness. He was dark and brooding most of the time and loud and <br />
immature others and always writing god knows what. He was an author <br />
who enjoyed writing dark shit but no one bothered to try to discover much beyond that or look into what made <br />
him this way. The answers probably scared them.  Back at home <br />
he had nothing. At sixteen his American mom fell for a Mexican man who made her feel special but when he was <br />
deported she was left <br />
with nothing but his child. Now working around the clock to support Luis by herself she had bece bitter with <br />
him, projecting her hatred for <br />
his father on him whenever she was around. Luis brushed his long dark locks from in frog of his eyes and kept <br />
writing, it was the only way <br />
to stay sane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup emo-bitch what are you writing?&quot; The deep voice of David, one of the school's senior soccer jocks, made <br />
Luis look up in fear and <br />
loathing. &quot;Gym isn't for your creepy faggot stories&quot; he mocked, ripping the book out of Luis's hands &quot;go do <br />
something normal for a <br />
change.&quot;. Luis just stared without saying a word. David was the exact opposite of Luis. He was built, <br />
handsome, popular and smart. Standing at about average height but fairly broad with a good build from soccer.  <br />
He had short blond hair and not a single stray hair on his face.  The image of clean cut jock.  He <br />
came from a wealthy and loving family that has catered to his every need yet instead of making him a good <br />
person it's made him cold, <br />
condescending and given him a sense of entitlement. He knows how to play the social game though, sucking up to <br />
those above him while <br />
stomping those beneath him, like Luis. &quot;What kind of fucked up book is this anyway?&quot; Luis just stared sadly.  <br />
&quot;Oh don't cry emo, just go cut yourself, we all know you do.&quot;  David opened it to a random page.<br />
<br />
'and as the jock read from the book he stole he began to notice a hot breath on his neck and even though he <br />
knew he shouldn't he turned <br />
around anyway and what he saw...' David DID notice a breath on his neck, he turned back around to see what <br />
that faggot was doing <br />
breathing on him. Instead of Luis, two monstrous red eyes ripped into him and he beheld a beastly monster <br />
shrouded in black were the boy once was. The features were human but so grotesquely distorted the resemblance <br />
was null.  Terrified, David lost his <br />
balance and fell down the bleachers. He felt every hit as he rag dolled down, his bones smashing against the <br />
wood and making horrible <br />
sounds until he finally landed in the court. Nothing seemed broken but his legs were bleeding pretty badly and <br />
he was covered in bruises. <br />
<br />
&quot;David! What the hell is wrong with you?&quot; David cringed at the sound of the coach's voice. &quot;Get your butt in <br />
the locker rooms and clean <br />
yourself up! You have a game this Saturday so for gods sake try not to kill yourself.&quot; David tried to point <br />
out Luis in the bleachers, still <br />
stuttering from whatever he saw... But the bleachers were empty. Trembling, David realized he was still <br />
holding the book. He knew he <br />
should throw it away but something was keeping him from letting go of it. Confused and in pain, David headed <br />
towards the locker rooms <br />
still carrying the book. Once in the locker rooms David opened the book again, there had to be an explanation <br />
for what just happened. <br />
He opened to the same page as the book described all the events that had just transpired. David flipped back <br />
through the pages an saw <br />
they detailed everything that had happened to him today from the time he woke up. Had that faggot been <br />
following him all day? David <br />
turned ahead in the book to after the fall.<br />
<br />
'Confused, the jock turned to the book for answers but the book only tells him he's about to cut himself just <br />
as the kids he steps on do from <br />
his torment. He doesn't believe this, he thinks he's reading total bullshit...' David dropped the book. Cut <br />
himself? Fuck that. He walked <br />
over to the mirror to check on his injuries. He turned on the water but hen he looke up he saw Luis' <br />
reflection instead of his. It followed <br />
his every movement, smiling, frowning. Then the face started laughing. Luis's weird laugh rang out in the <br />
bathroom, David looked <br />
around before clasping his neck and realizing the laughter came from him. The reflection began contorting in <br />
unimaginable ways. The <br />
already tan Latino skin darkened more an more to night black as the eyes rolled insanely and drew back further <br />
and further into their <br />
sockets. The hair flew in an unseen wind as the visage turned ghastly. Great arms emerged from the mirror and <br />
grabbed David's, pulling <br />
them over the sink, palms up. David couldn't move his arms, they were paralyzed. The shadowy appendages <br />
meanwhile conjured razor <br />
blades which they slowly lowered onto David's wrists. Pain exploded in him and he screamed, feeling his voice <br />
get higher and stranger as <br />
he began bleeding all over the sink. He continued screaming in Luis's voice as the blades cut deeper and the <br />
blood flow increased. The <br />
room began fading out and a dull ringing overwhelmed his sense until everything was black and silent...</p>
