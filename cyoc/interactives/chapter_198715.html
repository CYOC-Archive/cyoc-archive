<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, Lee had a full house, as, in addition to her normal house guests, she had the Archangel Raphael, as well as Cindy&#39;s aunt, Sarah, and her girlfriend, Andy.<br />
<br />
While Sarah spent most of her time consoling her sister, Andy seemed rather appreciative of the house, and said as much. <br />
<br />
“You got this place all to yourself?  It&#39;s pretty sweet.  I am sorry to hear about your folks though.”<br />
<br />
Lee sighed internally.  Her cover story, though useful, kept provoking these kinds of reactions.  It was unfortunate that she was gaining sympathy over a lie, but she had to appreciate the gesture.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Andy.  Do you mind if I ask if your name is short for Andrea?”<br />
<br />
Andy laughed.  “Worse.  Andretta!  You can see why I don&#39;t use it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my, I guess I can.  Still, forgive me for being nosy.”<br />
<br />
“Think nothing of it, hon, you&#39;ve helped out Sarah&#39;s family, you can ask me anything you want.  Most people don&#39;t start with that question though.”  The tall young woman chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Oh?  What do they ask?”<br />
<br />
“How a dope like me snagged such a lovely girl.”  Andy grinned.  She really did have a strongly male personality, but there was no doubt that she was all woman.  This happened sometimes when a soul was sent back to Earth.  Usually, a soul with a strong male identity comes back as a boy, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
It was obvious that Andy&#39;s soul had been male in, if not all, most of it&#39;s past incarnations, but this time, it had been reborn into a female body.  Still, she seemed perfectly content with her situation, so Lee wasn&#39;t about to meddle.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that hard to imagine at all.  You seem to be very kind and supportive, and from what I&#39;ve heard, most of Sarah&#39;s family had been quite the opposite.”<br />
<br />
“Whew, ain&#39;t that the truth.  When she told them she&#39;d hooked up with another girl, her father completely lost his mind.”  She ran her fingers through her short hair.  “He actually tried to get physical, but unfortunately for him, I&#39;m taller and stronger than he is.  As it was, they tried to call the cops for assault, even though I was just defending Sarah.”<br />
<br />
“Not yourself?”  Lee asked.<br />
<br />
Andy shrugged.  “I can take a few punches.  But Sarah..if anyone hurt her, I...I&#39;d probably do some bad things to them.”<br />
<br />
Lee reached out to touch Andy&#39;s hand.  It was calloused and she had scars on her fingers and the back of her hand.  Andy was obviously someone who had been fighting all her life.  She rubbed the back of Andy&#39;s hand with her thumb.  “I think that&#39;s perfectly acceptable.  Even noble, to want to protect your lady love.  But in this day and age, you have to be careful.”<br />
<br />
Andy blushed bashfully.  Lee had that affect on people.  “Yeah, I know.  So uh, can I ask a question?”<br />
<br />
“Of course!”  She smiled up at the taller woman.<br />
<br />
“When do we eat?  I&#39;m starving!”<br />
<br />
Lee giggled and promised it would be soon.  With this many people, she couldn&#39;t cook without revealing her powers, so she&#39;d fabricated the story that she&#39;d be ordering out.  In reality, she&#39;d dragooned Raphael (a fellow foodie, as it happened), to help conjure a delicious feast and arrange for it to appear to have been delivered.<br />
<br />
Even if this meant loaning Raphael some power, which irked her- Angels had an inexhaustable supply from the Throne of Heaven, after all.  But the Archangel had used enough of her power that any more would raise uncomfortable questions about her doings on Earth.<br />
<br />
She did, however, fully intend to make the Angel of Love pay her back with interest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dinner was laid out on a pair of long tables in the ballroom (of course Lee had a ballroom, wouldn&#39;t you?) and it wasn&#39;t long before everyone had their fill and were thanking her profusely.  She smiled because being a good hostess was one of those simple things that filled her with great pleasure.<br />
<br />
Everyone gathered in the parlor, and Lee was able to see the social dynamics sorting themselves out.  Cole was at her side, with Tara and Alison cuddled up on her other side.<br />
<br />
while Cindy sat very close to Raphael, though not in physical contact.  Sarah was flanked by Andy and Marion.  The two sisters were whispering to themselves, and occasionally they would glance in Lee&#39;s direction.<br />
<br />
She wondered what that was about, but decided not to eavesdrop.  Hopefully people would start going to bed soon, so she could enact her punishment.  She wondered if Cole would make an exception for Sarah and Andy, as they didn&#39;t know her very well, and it would be awkward to offer herself to them.<br />
<br />
As if reading her mind, Andy got up and said she was going to bring Sarah home.  The small woman seemed reluctant to leave her sister, but the two embraced and Marion shooed her off.<br />
<br />
Lee got up and said she was going to turn in early, and she headed for her room.  To her surprise, Marion followed her. <br />
<br />
“Lee, can we talk for a moment?”<br />
<br />
Lee nodded, and led her into her room, making sure the door was magically sealed.  She sat on the bed and offered for Marion to join her.<br />
<br />
The older (well, in appearance, at least) woman looked around in awe before sitting down, looking up at the ceiling.  “Was this your parent&#39;s room?  It&#39;s very romantic.”<br />
<br />
“You think so?  But no, Tara and I didn&#39;t live in this town until recently.  The house simply had all the amenities I wanted.”<br />
<br />
Marion nodded, looking a bit nervous.  “This is...not easy for me to say, and I hope you won&#39;t react badly.  I&#39;m over twice your age, after all...but...you seem incredibly mature for your age.”<br />
<br />
Lee suddenly realized what was going on.  How had she missed this?  For centuries, she&#39;d studied human emotions, but this was a surprise.  She remained stoic, however.  “People say I was born old, I guess.  Personally, I believe that most people have lived before, even to the point of having many lives.”<br />
<br />
“Reincarnation?  So you don&#39;t think people go to the Heaven?”  Marion asked.<br />
<br />
“I know you&#39;re a religious person, so I hope I don&#39;t shock you with my beliefs, but I think Heaven is just a brief stop on the journey of life.  Like going on a pleasant vacation before getting back to the grind.  The ultimate goal of the soul is to learn and grow, after all.”<br />
<br />
“I like that.  If I died...even if I went to Heaven, I&#39;d miss my kids.  Sarah.  Andy.”  She sighed.  “Anyways, the reason I bring this up is...you&#39;re a very attractive young woman.  There&#39;s something about you that I can&#39;t quite understand.  You&#39;re mysterious and beautiful, and I think I&#39;m falling for you.<br />
<br />
I know that&#39;s silly and ridiculous coming from a woman my age, who only just recently lost her husband, but...”<br />
<br />
Lee moved closer to Marion, reaching up to place a finger on the woman&#39;s lips.  “I don&#39;t think it&#39;s silly at all.  You&#39;re a loving and caring woman who made a mistake.  Your husband was not the man you thought he was, that&#39;s all.  I can tell that you&#39;re hurting, and if you think I can help you, I&#39;d be happy to.”<br />
<br />
Marion nodded.  “I don&#39;t know.  But I can&#39;t stop thinking about you.”<br />
<br />
Lee leaned in.  Though taller than Cindy and Sarah, she was still a smaller woman.  She brushed her lips against Marion&#39;s, running her fingers through her blonde hair.<br />
<br />
Marion shivered, and returned the kiss.  They made out for a little while longer, and then paused to remove their clothing.  Marion was in great shape, with only a little excess body fat.  Her breasts were larger than Cindy&#39;s, with darker nipples.  They sagged a little bit, but women ten years younger than she was would be jealous of her body.<br />
<br />
To Lee, Marion was like a fine wine.  To be savored.  But she let Marion take charge for now; she had other matters to attend to.<br />
<br />
Normally, she would split off pieces of herself in private, but she couldn&#39;t get away with that now, so instead, she let portions of her essence split off.  She felt weakened, and she was dimly aware of her other selves as they formed elsewhere in the house.  She tuned them out for now, and got back to the business at hand...<br />
<br />
<br />
After saying goodnight to Alison, Cindy was confused.  “I wonder where Mom is?”<br />
<br />
Raphael took Cindy&#39;s hand.  “Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s in good hands.  She wanted to talk to Lee.”<br />
<br />
“Really, what for?”<br />
<br />
Raphael dragged Cindy to the guest room she was using.  “She&#39;s a little lost right now, that&#39;s all.”<br />
<br />
Cindy frowned, but Raphael gently guided her to the bed.  “You, my love, need to stop worrying so much.”<br />
<br />
Cindy smiled.  She found Raphael easy to trust.  “Ok.”  She started to get undressed when there was a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
Raphael answered the door to reveal Lee, wearing a nightgown.  She could tell there was something different about Lee- she seemed less powerful than usual...ah!  She had formed a simulacrum!  She wondered why, but let the demon in.<br />
<br />
“Did you need something, Lee?”<br />
<br />
“I did.” She pointed at Cindy.  “I want her.  And you.”  She then slid her gown off her shoulders, revealing her naked body.<br />
<br />
Cindy opened her mouth and her brains dribbled out of her ears.  “Guh...”<br />
<br />
Raphael smiled.  “Just like old times, then.”  She removed her own clothing.  “Do you want to help me with her first?”<br />
<br />
Lee nodded, and Cindy found herself being attacked on two fronts.  She was happy to surrender...<br />
<br />
<br />
Alone in Tara&#39;s room, the two girls got ready for bed.  Alison had wanted to broach the topic of...intimacy...with Tara (or her alter ego) all day, but she hadn&#39;t really had the chance.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Lee simply phased through the wall, completely naked.  Alison found herself staring at the woman&#39;s beauty, as mysterious at the night itself.<br />
<br />
Lee smiled.  “Winrya.  I think Alison is ready to know what it&#39;s like to be a woman.”<br />
<br />
Tara nodded.  “Shall I take on my true form?”<br />
<br />
“What do you think, Alison?  Do you find the the idea of taking both sisters on at once more appealing?”<br />
<br />
Alison gulped, and looked from one to the other.  “I...I&#39;d like that.”<br />
<br />
She found herself being guided to the bed, a beautiful girl on either side of her, and as they reached out to touch her body with her hands, she couldn&#39;t help but let out a soft moan...<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee held Marion in her arms.  The woman had broke down crying after her orgasm, and Lee rocked her, making soothing noises in her ear.  Finally, Marion calmed down and sniffled.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“For what?  Your emotions are very tender right now.  I&#39;d be more worried if you didn&#39;t cry.”<br />
<br />
Marion turned and kissed Lee, who returned the gesture.  <br />
<br />
“How am I going to explain this to my kids?”  Marion frowned.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think it will be that hard.  They&#39;re both attracted to me as well.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God..that makes it worse!”<br />
<br />
“Shh, don&#39;t say that.  Cindy has someone she loves in her life now.”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
“She does?  How did I miss that?”  Marion hung her head.<br />
<br />
Lee raised Marion&#39;s face up to look into her eyes.  “It&#39;s going to be alright.”<br />
<br />
Marion sighed.  “And Alison? She&#39;s only 11...”<br />
<br />
“Not too young to have her first crush, apparently.  She&#39;s a wonderful girl...I&#39;m flattered.  But what do you think?”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  I...I don&#39;t now.  As her Mother, I&#39;m concerned and don&#39;t want her to grow up so fast...but I guess I&#39;d be a hypocrite if I said anything.”<br />
<br />
“Not at all.  Just let her know you&#39;re concerned, and want her to be safe.  I&#39;m fairly certain she&#39;s talked to your sister about this.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!  Damn it, Sarah, how could you not tell me!”  Marion looked upset, but Lee silenced her with another kiss.<br />
<br />
“You trust Sarah.  And you know she&#39;d never reveal your secrets.”<br />
<br />
Marion relaxed and nodded.  “You&#39;re right.  Have you...have you had sex with Cindy?”<br />
<br />
“I have.”  Lee saw no reason to lie.  “She&#39;s a wonderful girl.  But her heart belongs to another.”<br />
<br />
“But what about you?  Don&#39;t your feelings matter?”<br />
<br />
“I...I care about people.  Strongly.  But I&#39;ve never felt love before.  I&#39;m very fond of those people close to me, and I would do anything in my power to make them feel safe and cared for.  But love...I knew what it felt like, once.  Now my heart is scabbed over, so I can&#39;t be hurt again.”<br />
<br />
Marion looked sad.  “You poor thing.  But what about your sister?”<br />
<br />
“She loves me more than anything.  But I can&#39;t return her love as much as she deserves.  I wish I was more like Cindy.  She&#39;d cut off her own arm to save Alison.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  She would.  I was so blind...I didn&#39;t see how much she was afraid that Trent would hurt Alison...”<br />
<br />
“Shh.  None of that now.  I&#39;ve a mind to pleasure you again.”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
Marion felt her mouth go dry.  “I...I need some water.”<br />
<br />
“If you don&#39;t want that, it&#39;s ok.”<br />
<br />
Marion shook her head.  “God no.  I want you so bad it hurts.”<br />
<br />
Lee grinned, her teeth gleaming in the dim light.  “I&#39;ll be happy to do something about that.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The last simulacrum found Cole, sitting up watching a movie.  She&#39;d divided her essence so many times that this version of Lee was noticeably smaller than the others.  She sat on the couch with Cole.<br />
<br />
Cole looked to her.  “Oh wow, you&#39;re like Cindy&#39;s size.”<br />
<br />
“Couldn&#39;t be helped.  I&#39;ve never done anything like this before- that is, to this degree.  So I couldn&#39;t split evenly.”<br />
<br />
“Is this hurting you?”  Cole pulled the smaller girl close.<br />
<br />
“No.  Actually...it&#39;s kind of nice.  I can feel them in  my head.  Everyone is having a good time.”  She smiled.  “But it is...strange...feeling so weak.”<br />
<br />
“Can humans split apart?”<br />
<br />
Lee nodded.  “Some of the Saints could bilocate.  With fusion, the problem is separating again.  But fission is fairly safe, though you have to share mass with your simulacrums.  So if you split, both of you would weight have as much, and be three-quarters the height.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  Oh right, square cube law!  Well, I&#39;ve been pretty tiny before, so that&#39;s not a big deal.”<br />
<br />
“The only real problem is if one of your other selves doesn&#39;t want to merge back again afterwards.  Once you&#39;ve had a taste of thinking and living on your own, merging...might feel like dying.  Ceasing to exist.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s not really true though, you&#39;d be part of your original self, right?  I think it would be scarier to realize a part of you is missing.”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“A lot of it depends on how much you love yourself.  Tell me, Cole  Do you love Cole?”<br />
<br />
“I...”  Cole sighed.  “No.  Not really.”<br />
<br />
“I rather thought as much.  That&#39;s why you want to learn to become someone different.  I&#39;m going to have to teach you that it&#39;s good to be Cole.”<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s so good about it?”<br />
<br />
Lee smiled.  “The fact that she&#39;s going to fucked in ways she never knew were possible.  Are you ready?”<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s eyes got wide, and then she nodded.  The two made their way to an unused guest room...</p>
