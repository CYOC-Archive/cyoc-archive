<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While John found himself entranced by the siren call of a hot shower to relieve his mental tensions and an after workout stress reliever, Kim found herself curled up on the couch watching her debuting drama series “Love of the Generations”, the plot had been at first a novice one: A seemingly wealthy but aged woman who had a wonderful younger husband who was every inch of the man the gods could forge, but found herself caught between the love of the young paramour, and the desire to be dominated by a mysterious new man who seemed right out of her dreams.<br />
<br />
“But Amanda… How could you ever fall in love with him…?! He’s… He’s…”<br />
<br />
“A younger man, I know! I know all about him, Stefan, but he’s so perfect, he’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a man, I-“<br />
<br />
“He is your <i>son</i>, Amanda!” Shouted the younger man, body toned from his obvious fan-service indulging v-neck that gave a sultry view of his hairy chest as he attempted to hold his wife accountable, wringing her shoulders slightly as she wept bitterly, eyes shut and faced away from him.<br />
<br />
Kim sniffed back tears, her soaps had always done this to her, she briefly recalled watching them many a time with John, and presumably her own chil- No, that couldn’t be right, John had been a 30 year old bodybuilder that she had been living with, but there was no doubt in her mind that these shows were her personal fantasies personified and not having John’s constant talk about bulking up bigger and wanting her to caress his body was… Nice, for a change. This was her solace, she mentally stated, drawing a napkin from a handy tissue box as the show concluded, her mind at ease but more than ready to retire to her master bedroom. Voracious as he was, she had hoped to sneak an hour before John had finished his long shower and their ritualistic… Exchange of perspectives would happen, her face flushed red as she felt herself heat up at the thought of her nails lightly scratching his wide upper torso, dragging them across his rugged back as he grunted over her meek body.<br />
<br />
She gently tiptoed past the shower and Simon’s room, the young man’s door locked after he had came home not long during her show and excused himself to go to his room early. She knew better than to question John’s so- Brother from one of his lower moods, John had mentioned that Simon sometimes felt like he was cast under his shadow due to the lack of parental figures and John had stepped up to the plate to serve as a strong father role model and as a brother despite his bodybuilding career. As she maneuvered to their bedroom and laid herself onto the soft mattress, Kim sighed as she tossed and turned in ecstasy, she loved her life. A middle aged woman like her landing a fit, rugged man who had no time for nonsense and loved every inch of himself AND hers was one that lit her loins on fire, and more than ever she could feel the sexual tension overflow even when she didn’t feel in the mood, John never minded, but he certainly could change minds with the ridiculous fingertips of his when he’d tease her and massage her aching body to a jelly consistency.<br />
<br />
Kim felt her eyelids droop, before she looked at the time on the digital clock by the HD plasma tv, it was only 9:00 pm, but boy did it feel late for her... These days, it felt like time was slipping away, but the mornings were longer and the nights felt livelier with John as he was… Pulling herself up, Kim looked around the luxurious bed to see where her husband had left the remote, but, frustratedly sighed as she realized the tv remote was not on the bed. Nor was it on the nightstand or the large dresser in the room, and as Kim grumbled, she decided to change into a night gown and search the one place John may have accidentally left the remote: His trophy room. She vaguely recalled John would rave about his job before, but… As time became familiar to her memories, the thought about John working a middle wage or salaryman-esque job was becoming more outlandish, <i>the</i> John Sanderson? 2, no, 3 time IFBB Pro Bodybuilder, at 285 lbs? Kim knew better, the world did… But what she indulged herself was seeing the perky tight ass John was building up even bigger than the other day when he sauntered by her in the nude, as she drew open the trophy closet door, her throat ran dry as she began to perspire under the thought of John’s powerful body at her beck and call.<br />
<br />
She knew it wasn’t all too good to be true, John had taken looks from <i>many</i> people, her included, but having John to herself like this… It was all the more orgasmic knowing this stud was off the market for her use only. Kim eyed the trophies with a sense of pride and longing, knowing vaguely of the progress John had went through from his stories and even in bed from when he was but a “smaller” man, if one could call a 230 lb man “small”. Gently tilting the golden trophies of similar built musclemen in speedos and various poses, Kim’s eyes shone as they fell unto John’s pride and joy: The NY Nationals Bodybuilding Pro Trophy. The trophy was made in his honor, the muscleman that stood confidently in place with a most muscular pose gazed levelly in her eyes, and an oddly colored object was behind the man that seemed most likely to what she was attempting to find. With glee, Kim smiled, tenderly reaching her hand past “Mini” John and grabbing the remote, assuring herself that John’s carelessness would be easily forgiven, and, even if he would raise a ruckus, she’d simply sneak the remote back. Kim just needed some much needed “Girl Time”, and having the latest season of The Bachelorette would do just that, she smugly grinned, closing the closet door behind her and closing the bedroom door with giddy lust.<br />
<br />
Nearly tossing herself onto the silken sheets, Kim pressed the power button in a hurry, but saw no reaction in the blank screen. Pressing the button again twice, Kim huffed as she was treated to a new “screen” of sorts, one that had called itself “Chronivac”, obviously some new brand of television sets John and Simon must have bought before her arrival. <br />
<br />
“Men and their need of sports in HD,” Kim laughed, clearly still riding the high of seeing the Bachelorette contestants strut their stuff in a swimwear pageant that she and her friends eagerly had been discussing in their respective girls’ chat. As the tv set loaded, Kim found herself in a menu that consisted of various statistics and “relationships” that included herself, Simon, and John. “John… You and your fitness apps, no one ever uses a tv set for a fitness program, you lovable man you…” Kim mused, cycling through the menus until she eyed a “create new entry” button. Believing it to be a preset package of channels John must have installed for himself and his brother, Kim went through the annoying process of creating a new “entry” labeled:<br />
<br />
“Mr. Perfect” as though to search for The Bachelorette’s episode of the same name. “Adjust occupant to “Mr. Perfect”? The Chronivac warned, highlighting a “No” option next to a “Yes option button. In the small letters, the Chronivac menu had written: <br />
<br />
<b>“WARNING: If a particular subject name is not chosen, the new identity will be placed randomly of the total occupants able to be applied, along with those in the surrounding vicinity”</b><br />
<br />
“Of course!” Kim eagerly followed, unaware of the warning’s unfortunately small font, adjusting her aim and tapping “Yes” rapidly to the inquiry.<br />
<br />
<b>Accepted, please enter new revised entry</b><br />
<br />
Kim blanked as she noticed the new screen, asking for an input of numbers of age, weight, and even of words like “relationship” and “Job description”… But immediately began to grin as she realized her chance at narrowing down the seasons by describing the man she knew caught her eye.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see…” She sighed, excitedly, already punching in Mr. Perfect’s stats into the Chronivac, while she didn’t know his name at the top of her head… She already knew every last inch of her dream man.</p>
