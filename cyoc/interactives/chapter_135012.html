<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An idea crept into Jo’s head. It was a completely naughty, twisted, horrible idea, but it was also intensely arousing. She made another wish, but this time, she did it without even speaking, just by thinking the words to herself. <i>I wish that people would believe anything I told them as if it was a fact, no matter what it is,</i> she thought. She wasn’t sure if it worked or not, but she figured that, if it didn’t, she could always fix it by wishing aloud, instead.<br />
<br />
“Catherine,” she started, “I just happened to be reading something the other day. It talked about how trust and intimacy is important to effective therapy.” It was a lie—she hadn’t been reading any such thing—but if her wish had worked, it was a perfect excuse for the much more significant lie yet to come.<br />
<br />
Catherine nodded. “That’s true, yes. You know you can always be as open with me as you like, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I do,” Jo continued, “but what I was reading was talking about something I hadn’t heard of before. It said that, for some patients, the only way to truly reach the necessary level of closeness was to be <i>sexually</i> intimate.”<br />
<br />
Normally, Catherine would surely have found the idea ridiculous, maybe even disturbing, but thanks to the power of the ring, she just nodded slowly, appearing to be in deep thought. “Yes, that does make some sense, doesn’t it? I’m surprised I’d never heard of that before, myself. Is it safe to assume you felt like that would be helpful for you?”<br />
<br />
Jo nodded, struggling to contain her smile and maintain her faux nervousness. “Yes… I just wasn’t sure if you would be open to the idea. I’ve been afraid to ask.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s true that normally I’m not into women,” Catherine said, “but I do care a lot about helping my clients as much as I can. I think I would be willing to at least try having sex with you, and we can see if it helps.”<br />
<br />
Jo felt herself growing very wet from the ease with which her therapist accepted the ridiculous idea that they should actually <i>have sex</i> together. The power she now wielded was intoxicating. At first, she’d thought she’d be content to wait until her next appointment with Catherine to try out her new suggestion, but now, she was too lustful to wait. She made another request for the ring. <i>I wish it was normal for me to be naked in public, too, but people will still be attracted to my naked body. It’s also okay for me to masturbate or have sex with whoever I want, wherever I want.</i> As soon as she made her wish, she started to strip off her clothes so that she could be naked with Catherine.<br />
<br />
“Well, to tell you the truth, I think it would be for the best if we had sex right now, actually,” Jo said.<br />
<br />
Catherine didn’t resist. She just dropped her purse to the ground and smiled at the young woman. “My body is yours. Just not for too long, okay? I have an appointment in less than two hours.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that won’t be a problem,” Jo said, finally doing what she wanted to do since she first stripped Catherine naked and cupping Catherine’s breasts with her hands. The feeling of groping her therapist’s naked body in public was exhilarating. She rubbed the woman’s nipples, and Catherine made soft sounds of pleasure in return. Truthfully, though, Jo wanted the breasts to be bigger. Fortunately, she could change that now. <i>I wish Catherine’s breasts were ever-perky DD cups, and I wish they would lactate when touched.</i> Within moments, she felt Catherine’s bosom swell under her fingers, and soon, little droplets of warm, white liquid were streaming from her nipples.<br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness, Jo… what just happened to me? Did you do that?” Catherine seemed shocked by what had happened to her chest, which seemed a little silly, given that she was totally okay with being groped in public. Of course, it made sense, since Jo hadn’t actually made it normal for her to have the bigger, milkier breasts. Fortunately, she could fix this problem without even needing to make another wish.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, Catherine? You’ve always had breasts this big, and they’ve been lactating since I first met you. That’s why you keep the milking machine in your office and sometimes have to milk yourself during our sessions, remember? To be honest, I always found it kind of sexy to watch.”<br />
<br />
Catherine furrowed her brow, even as she gasped in pleasure. “Mmm… I guess you’re right. I don’t have any idea why I forgot something like that. In retrospect, I guess it wasn’t hard to tell that you found it alluring.” She smiled. “In any case, please, drink from them if you want. I just want you to feel better.”<br />
<br />
Jo didn’t need to be told twice. She wrapped her lips around one of Catherine’s large nipples and began to suckle. Her milk was warm and sweet, and the feeling of it running down her throat made her desperately in need of sexual release. “Mnnph. Catherine… I need to you eat me out.”<br />
<br />
“Whatever you think is best,” Catherine said, smiling, falling to her knees and pressing her face against Jo’s pussy. She began to lick the girl’s clit, and Jo gasped with pleasure. “Is this good? I’ve never done this before.”<br />
<br />
“God yes,” Jo murmured, “just keep doing that.” Catherine obeyed the request, licking harder and firmer, tasting Jo’s musky juices, and before long, Jo was orgasming, squealing and squirming against Catherine’s nude body. “Ohh… mmm. Thank you, Catherine. That helped a lot.”<br />
<br />
Catherine’s face was covered in Jo’s juices, but she didn’t seem to mind as she wiped them on the back of her hand. “Of course. Let me know if you ever need my help, okay? I know you have my phone number.” And with that, she stood up and picked up her bag. Jo just stood there, reveling in the glow of her orgasm, feeling a bit of disbelief about what had just happened. Eventually, though, she decided what to do next.</p>
