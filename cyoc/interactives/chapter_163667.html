<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You began to roam the park, your body seemingly knowing the way to all the major populated areas.<br />
Although you were still feeling a little discombobulated after... whatever had happened that morning, you were still able to maintain a bright, sunny attitude and you found your walk turning into an energetic skip.<br />
<br />
In between your delightful little photo sessions with the guests, you bounced on your heels and twirled on your tippy toes, taking in the bright and colorful sights of the park. Every so often, a niggling little voice in the back of your head nagged at you about something, but there was always some new distraction to take your mind off of it. You perked up at the sound of cheesy rock music emanating from the Toon Town district and made your way there immediately.<br />
<br />
A band of colorful animals in glam-rock face paint were jamming out on a brightly lit stage for the amusement of a large crowd of guests. The canine lead guitarist was accompanied by a crocodile drummer, a sleepy squirrel bassist, and a gyrating female zebra who acted as the lead vocalist. Most of them only wore a single item of clothing, like yourself, or otherwise went completely nude.<br />
<br />
Other mascots in the area danced to the music and you couldn&#39;t help but join in, bopping enthusiastically and shaking our feathered rear to the corny yet energetic tune.<br />
By the time the band had reached their final set, the sun was starting to go down and guests were beginning to leave.<br />
A high-pitched voice squeaked out &quot;Dixie?&quot; and snapped you out of your dancing reverie.<br />
<br />
You turned around to see a small, sandy colored cat mascot in an apron and oven mitts.<br />
&quot;Matilda says she needs your help in the break room kitchen. It&#39;s nearly time for dinner.&quot;<br />
Even though you had never met this cat before, nor this &quot;Matilda&quot; character, somehow you felt like a real dummy for forgetting about your kitchen duties. You decided to go with her immediately.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when you spotted them out of the corner of your eye. It took you a moment to recognize them, but your human family appeared to be leaving the park together. They looked tired but happy, and appeared to show no sign of concern over your disappearance. You desperately wanted to approach them but... something was pulling at you. Your duties, your job as a mascot. You stood frozen in place, paralyzed with indecision, and just watched as your family disappeared out of view.<br />
Wait, why were you staring? You had urgent business in the kitchen!<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d better hurry!&quot; You chirped, as the two of you turned away from Toon Town and made your way down a narrow side path.<br />
You reached a dead-end behind one of the rides. The little cat mascot pressed an indentation in the wall and it slid open to reveal a stairway leading down into the depths of the park.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the bottom, you found yourself in a cheerfully decorated main lobby area.<br />
The little cat took your hand in her mitt and led you down a hallway, past rows of doors. You passed a recreation area complete with arcade machines, a pool table, a television and an oversized toy box among other things. You felt the fog in your mind fading now, your thoughts becoming more lucid.<br />
<br />
You began to wonder how big this underground complex was, and suddenly found yourself feeling a bit lost and confused. What was going on in this park? You wondered. And why had you just been going along with it?<br />
<br />
You entered a sort of dining area set up with tables and chairs and what looked like a G-rated bar that served child-appropriate drinks. The cat mascot led you through a set of double doors that entered into a kitchen stocked with all kinds of glittering silver cooking utensils and appliances. It looked incredibly sleek and modern, and remarkably clean.<br />
<br />
You were greeted by a sweet, motherly looking brown-and-white speckled cow who also wore nothing but an apron.<br />
&quot;Ah, there she is! Thanks a bunch for fetching her, Ragamuffin.&quot; she spoke in a gentle, soothing voice.<br />
The cat girl just nodded and got to work, having to stand up on her tip-toes to reach the various ingredients and utensils on the counters and shelves.<br />
<br />
The cow lady turned to face you, &quot;Tonight&#39;s dinner menu calls for cupcakes, but we&#39;ve come up a little short on ingredients as usual. I&#39;ll leave the rest to you, sugar!&quot; she smiled and turned her attention back to the various ovens lining the wall, turning dials and adjusting knobs like a pro.<br />
<br />
The diminutive cat girl mascot was busy gathering together the cupcake ingredients and you decided to help her, reaching for a bag of flour that was just out of her reach. Unfortunately, the feathers on your arm brushed against a pair of salt and pepper shakers, sending them tumbling to the ground and alerting Matilda with the sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t you worry about that.&quot; Matilda said, &quot;We can handle the cooking, you just do your thing. Three big ones should be enough for everyone.&quot; What was she talking about?<br />
She pointed to a far corner of the kitchen where you saw a slightly raised surface covered in shredded newspaper. A sort of artificial nest. <br />
<br />
Oh no.<br />
<br />
You made your way over to the nest, turned around and instinctively parked your rear on its  edge.<br />
This wasn&#39;t seriously happening, right?<br />
A pressure built up in your lower abdomen and you felt something begin to push its way out of your body. It wasn&#39;t automatic, but you somehow just knew how to contract the necessary muscles to help push the payload along.<br />
This was indeed happening. You were laying an egg.<br />
<br />
The next part was much more difficult. You felt the egg pushing against the tight opening in your rear, but it wasn&#39;t going to simply slide out. Grunting and straining, you clenched some obscure muscle deep in your body and began to forcefully push the thing out. The egg began to crown, and taking a deep breath, you managed to squeeze it the rest of the way out with a barely audible pop. A wave of relief washed over your entire body, leaving you feeling tingly.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t get much time to catch your breath though, as the pressure in your abdomen quickly reappeared and the process repeated for a second time. You did at the very least learn a bit about chicken anatomy from the experience. You had always figured that chicken eggs must emerge pointed-end first, but you found that it was actually the opposite, with the rounded end emerging first and the inner walls of your cloaca squeezing the pointed end to push it along.<br />
<br />
By the time the third egg had been pushed out of your body, you were exhausted. You panted and wheezed, leaning onto a nearby counter for support. The small cloaca between your feathery butt cheeks was burning, but not in an especially painful way.<br />
<br />
Matilda came over to examine the three giant eggs you had laid. Each one perfectly white and larger than a grapefruit. For some reason when you looked at them you couldn&#39;t help but feel a strange tinge of pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, darlin&#39;. Those should be more than enough.&quot; Matilda beamed, placing a hoof-hand on your shoulder.<br />
&quot;Now why don&#39;t you return to the break room and rest up before dinner. The others&#39;ll be arriving soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eager to find a comfy chair or couch and take a load off for a while, you complied and made your way out of the kitchen area, taking one last glance at the big, perfect eggs you had just made.</p>
