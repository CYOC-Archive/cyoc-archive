<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up feeling delirious, and your vision was blurry. You felt as if you were drugged and were having hangover, and then you groaned and tried to stand. However, you fell as soon as you got toll 2 feet off of your ass. You then heard a voice growl at you,&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
You were startled, but too weak to move your body at all. &quot;Wh...who&#39;s out th...there?&quot; You asked barely even able to form words in your mouth, sounding drunk. Moments later you saw a large light tan figure directly to your side and you screamed in the form of a roar, but then your mouth was clamped shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, calm down!&quot; The voice growled,&quot;I know they put that fucked up spell on you, but don’t worry we’re friends.&quot; You paused squinting your eyes to focus in on the figure&#39;s head, and you were able to make out a familiar creature&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
It was a basilisk with scales that were as the color of the desert sand, and he looked larger than you, and certainly more intimidating than any basilisk that you&#39;ve seen up to this point. At this realization you shut your eyes tightly and growled,&quot;No no no NO! I am not getting fucked again!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then felt your four front claws being held down against the ground and you saw that the large king basilisk was holding down two of them. You peered down at your other two and saw a lesser blue basilisk female who had a noticeable stomach bulge, and a yellow basilisk who was male. Both small basilisks gripped onto your legs and used the weight of their bodies to hold you in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop miss, we only wish to help!&quot; The female cried and the yellow male added,&quot;We are traitors like you! Sent off to the humans like you were.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once you heard this you’re mind snapped into focus of your surroundings. You were surrounded by sand, large rocks, and you were inside a large nest within a cave. Two large bowls sat next to the nest, one with water and the other was currently empty.<br />
<br />
You also calmed down once you heard the lesser male&#39;s exclamation, and you paused and looked down at him,&quot;Wait what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s true, just lay down, take deep breaths and try to refocus yourself. Your sight is temporarily impaired because the humans casted a spell on you. Unfortunately it has some nasty side affects that we all experienced firstclaw.&quot; The king basilisk explains and you looked at him and nodded.<br />
<br />
You then laid down on your stomach and started taking deep breaths. Your vision was still pretty bad, and you were only able to see about 5 feet in front of you with only momentary glimpses of the distance every few moments. You watched as the two lesser basilisks released you and the two laid down in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; You said panting,&quot;Okay, I&#39;m fine just....freaking out. Where are we, and who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The king basilisk smiled and said,&quot;Good, it’s starting to wear off. Not all of us had names originally, so we all use the names that humans dub us with. I&#39;m Desert, the yellow male is Lightning, and the blue female is Azure. We’re all at what the humans refer to as a zoo, and this is your new home.&quot; You then paused and thought,&quot;Zoo? Oh no, am I seriously getting treated like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
You thoughts were then interrupted by Azure as she rolled over to show off her swollen gut and said,&quot;We&#39;re mates.&quot; Azure leaned up against Lightning and he nuzzled her back. &quot;I’m expecting, as you can probably already tell.&quot; She said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
Although a bit disgusted with the knowledge that you could get pregnant now, seeing another female pregnant gave you a warm feeling of happiness for some reason, and almost made you jealous. You then turned to Desert and blushed then he said,&quot;You had bruises all over the side of your body, and a few broken bones. The humans said that as they brought you inside, but they casted a healing spell to patch you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lightning then added,&quot;You were scared of being fucked too, and your vagina was all stretched out. You smelled like you were just mates with too, but not by a basilisk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We uh....were wondering what happened....so uh.....we thought we’d ask.....what happened? Are uh....you alright miss?&quot; Azure asked<br />
<br />
You flashed back to the incredible sensation you felt when the dragon forced his enormous cocks spilled their seed into your cunt, and you blushed red. &quot;Nope, it was nothing...nooothing to worry about aaat all.&quot; You said desperately looking for some sort of diversion around you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get separated with your mate? Was he the reason you ended up here?&quot; Desert asked then Azure paused and whimpered,&quot;A....are you Uh....pregnant like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I don’t have a mate! I’m not pregnant, and I don’t feel comfortable talking about what happened, okay?!&quot; You roared<br />
<br />
Lightning and Azure almost jumped at your sudden outburst, and Desert looked at you wide eyed then he peered down at the two lesser reptiles. &quot;Maybe you two should leave, and leave this to me. The humans will probably want to see you doing....something.&quot; Desert said and the two of them nodded.<br />
<br />
Lightning stood up before Azure, and he helped her up to her feet. The two then exited the cave and left you alone with Desert. &quot;Hey,&quot; Desert said and nudged you,&quot;What’s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
You crossed your top set of arms and growled,&quot;It’s personal!&quot; You then looked down and saw your breasts then sighed stubbornly. Desert then nudged you again and you just glared back at him and hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa now, I’m not going to hurt you. We&#39;re all here because we’re traitors in some way shape or form. All of us are personally effected one way or another.&quot; Desert said to you in a calming tone with his deep voice.<br />
<br />
You just snorted at Desert and continued looking down at the ground. You considered standing up and walking out, but the thought of hundreds of people observing you sounded frightening to you. You asshole and vagina already were visible to the naked eye, but your breasts were huge and you weren’t even pregnant. On top of all that everytime you would need to piss or shit you would be watched by dozens of humans at a time.<br />
<br />
Desert nudged you for a third time now and asked,&quot;I feel for you, we all do, but we here can’t trust you if we don’t know your past.&quot; You heard this then turned away and whimpered,&quot;You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desert placed his claw on your back and said,&quot;Try me,&quot; and turned back and locked eyes as he gave you a serious expression. You paused for a few moments as you found yourself lost in his gaze for a few seconds, but then you dropped your head frowning and sighed,&quot;I&#39;m.....human, a male human, or at least I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desert paused with an inquisitive look on his face as he studied your expression and his eyes grew wide the moment he knew you were being serious. &quot;So you....and then....how?!&quot; Desert yapped and you just growled and looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, nevermind! I can already tell that you won’t believe the whole story!&quot; You snarled as you turned, and then Desert walked around into your gaze. &quot;Well...can you at least tell me what happened before you got here? What did you do before to get you sent here with us?&quot; Desert asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so annoying?! It’s not my fault that I got raped by a dragon an.....!&quot; You snarled then paused after hearing your own words and you saw Desert&#39;s jaw drop. &quot;He what?!&quot; Desert roared and your face turned red, and you growled at yourself,&quot;Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....that explains at least a few things. Are you....okay?&quot; Desert asked and you glared at him and growled,&quot;Don’t you dare tell anyone! Ever!!&quot; Desert nodded to you then you heard him let out a small whine. <br />
<br />
&quot;If....if it helps the reason I was deemed a traitor is because I don’t like conflict. I can’t fight, so please don’t hurt me!&quot; Desert whimpered and you witnessed the large beast, who was larger than you, cower beneath his claws before you as he pleaded for forgiveness.<br />
<br />
You watched Desert completely boggled as to how a creature like him was so timid in the first place. You were actually starting to feel bad about him more than yourself at this point. &quot;Wow...this wasn’t what I expected.&quot; You thought to yourself feeling as at first glance you thought that Desert was going to fuck you on sight, but he was really just a giant teddy bear of a beast.<br />
<br />
So you took a few steps towards him and nudged him with your snout,&quot;H...hey there, it’s okay, I won’t hurt you.&quot; Desert paused then he peered up at you and sniffled,&quot;R...Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to him and said,&quot;You’re fine just....don’t tell anyone about what I just blurted out, and the part about me being a human, okay?&quot; Desert paused then nodded and slowly picked himself back up and looked at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;S...so you do realize why...uh...the human stuck us together, right?&quot; Desert asked and you paused then you rose a brow and shook your head. Desert gulped at what he was about to say next and he whimpered,&quot;W...Well, they may want us to be.....mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then whined as a the familiar words of the dragon creeped into your thoughts,&quot;You&#39;ll get pregnant with young who ever mates with you next...&quot; You shuddered at the thought, but then remembered how it felt to be in heat, how much you needed to get fucked then, and how much you could need to get fucked in the future.<br />
<br />
You then looked to Desert and sighed and thought,&quot;He is a wimp, but he&#39;s certainly intimidating at first glance, and he&#39;s athletic, muscular even despite his useless in battle.&quot; You blushed as you stared at Desert&#39;s surprisingly muscular physique,&quot;I can’t ask him about his muscles though directly though could I? Not at least without giving him any ideas....he is cute though, adorable even when he’s scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then paused and realized your were debating about not only a beast, but a male beast at that. Suddenly a stray thought of what Desert&#39;s flaccid cock, or cocks might look like. You weren’t sure if he had two cocks yet or not, but something inside of you wanted it.<br />
<br />
You then heard Desert clear his throat to get your attention and you paused and shook your head and blushed. &quot;Uh...sorry, you probably aren’t really into me right now anyways...&quot; Desert began, but you then interrupted him and said,&quot;If I go into heat, then and only then will I let you make me your mate. For now...I just need some fresh air.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desert nodded to you and said,&quot;Okay, but uh...tell me when you get your tags. Then the rest of us will know your name.&quot; You paused for a moment and thought,&quot;tag?&quot; But then was Desert turned around to leave, you noticed a bright red tag on the tip of his tail, seemingly clipped through a drilled hole on his scales.<br />
<br />
You take a moment to process everything that had happened around you. You were now in a zoo, you were still female, you told a male king basilisk to become your mate if you went into heat, and finally you were apparently going to get a tag and a name. &quot;What now?&quot; You thought to yourself, and then....</p>
