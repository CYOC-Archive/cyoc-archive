<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wow, resting on the bed I still could not believe what I had just done with my siblings. Mariah orgasmed, I did the same and even squirted and John just blew his load three times, I have never done something like that with my old body, two in a day maximum and with some time to rest in between. Even with the extra exciting situation of me and Mariah…umm… servicing him, his balls would need to have been bursting with semen for him to have released so much, no wonder he said they were aching  <br />
<br />
Lying naked on the bed, I was waiting for the heat of the arousal to cool off, but far from calming down, my body appeared hungry for more action. I considered rousing my siblings for another round, but thought I had some fun with them, I didn’t want to make this a regular thing.<br />
<br />
Weirdly enough, I wasn’t feeling repulsed or regretful of my actions. When I was David, although I knew she was sexy, the idea of having sex with Mariah would be off putting, but maybe because this body instinctively recognized we weren’t of the same blood, I didn’t feel any reservations this time.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, thinking about the pounding that Mariah received….there was something that I would like to try with more privacy<br />
<br />
“Thank you, I enjoyed that” I whispered to Mariah and gave her a quick kiss on her cheek <br />
<br />
“mmm” she grunted in acknowledgment, but keep resting<br />
<br />
I hesitated a little, but gave John a kiss on his cheek too, but he was already asleep.<br />
<br />
I gave a glance to his penis and noticed that it was now limp but the condom was still wrapped around it. The thought of this member buried inside Mariah’s pussy just a moment ago sent tingles to my abdomen and seeing the semen accumulated at the tip of the rubber a naughty idea began to form in my mind.<br />
<br />
I took the condom from John’s penis carefully to not wake him up and quickly picked my clothes up. If my mom were to see me walking naked inside the house, she would certainly start to nag me about modesty, but since we were alone in the house, nobody was going to complain right now.<br />
<br />
While walking to my room, I did notice my muscles rolling and moving more easily, and my sensations a little sharper. I remembered what my therapist said about other swap participants feeling more comfortable with their bodies after orgasming, and I could begin to understand why. Not just the smoothness while moving and the clarity of my senses, mentally, I easily accepted that this body belongs to me. My face, my limbs, my chest, my back, my abdomen, my butt, my vagina; all are parts of me; and that acceptance made me happy.<br />
<br />
After entering my room, I looked at myself in the mirror. Compared to when I first received my body, right now I look and feel much better and healthier. Instead of a scrawny little girl looking back at me, I saw a young girl starting to show some muscle definition. With delicate but toned limbs and tight flat belly anybody looking at me would be able to tell that I was a girl full of energy and experiencing an active lifestyle<br />
<br />
The beginnings of puberty were already impossible not to notice, my previously flat chest was now sporting two swollen bumps and the areola had expanded a little. <br />
<br />
Feeling more at ease with my body  than ever, I began to realize that I didn’t feel like a man stuck inside the body of a little girl but more like a girl in body and mind for real <br />
<br />
Feeling more sexy and feminine in that moment than any time before, I puffed up my chest leaving my nipples on full display and dragged my fingers from the sides of my upper torso, to my waist and resting them on my hips. I didn’t have any curves to speak of, but I knew that it was only a matter of time. The thought of growing them didn’t feel shameful, on the other hand, I was starting to feel eager to have them.<br />
<br />
I gently swayed my ass, and although immature, the movements carried the elegance and sensuality of a female. Looking from every angle, I could not find even a hint of my previous masculinity, and I was totally fine with it. <br />
<br />
I could see a tinge of pink in my usually paler body betraying my excitement and arousal and with that thought, I moved the mirror in front of my bed and placed my pillows so I could look at myself and rest my head comfortably<br />
<br />
I lay down on the bed and parted my legs, so I could see my girly bits reflected in the mirror. In there I found some hair starting to grow near my vaginal lips, another sign of puberty progressing, but right now my focus was centered in another place.<br />
<br />
Spreading the lips of my slit, I noticed that although not at the level of when I was being licked, my pussy felt more swollen and moist than usual. With my right hand, I quickly found my vaginal opening and tried to put a finger inside, but instantly became aware of why Mariah didn’t do so before. the opening was too narrow<br />
<br />
I briefly pondered if I should give up for now, but the memory of Mariah being penetrated by John fueled my curiosity and excitement and pushed me to continue<br />
<br />
I carefully began to caress my nipples, mindful that they were becoming tender from so much contact today and used my other hand to start rubbing my pussy along my folds up and down<br />
<br />
My body began to react quickly and my vagina rapidly began to grow increasingly wet. I peeked into the mirror and all I could see was a girl trying to satiate her carnal pleasures. Let alone manly, she was not even boyish; although undeveloped, you could almost feel the femininity and charm radiating from her. If this was the ‘me’  two months after the swap, I wondered what I would see in the mirror in 1 year, 2 years and at the end of my puberty.<br />
<br />
I decided it was time to try the little souvenir I took from John. Since my body instantly reacted to the smell of dick when I gave John a blowjob, I wondered if the smell of semen would also increase my arousal, but… it made laugh a little to think the the semen that I wasted almost every day when I was a man would become such a hard to come by substance right now<br />
<br />
I began to sniff the semen inside the condom and as expected it just smelled like semen, but as I continued to let my lungs being filled with the scent, the odor gained an enchanting quality that I never felt while I was a man, and my lower abdomen began to throb and started to feel…empty <br />
<br />
I read that some women have difficulties getting wet, but looking at the fluids dripping from my pussy starting to drench my bed, I definitely didn&#39;t have this problem. Actually, next time I try this, I should put a towel beneath my butt to prevent the bed from getting wet. <br />
<br />
Anyways, now that I feel lubricated enough and properly excited I tried to insert a finger in my pussy and succeeded pushing it until the base of the nail; after that, it started to feel uncomfortable and had to retreat. Nonetheless, as I continued to push and pull my finger, my vagina began to accommodate more and more of its length.<br />
<br />
I not only focused on penetration, but   rubbed my folds and occasionally stirred my clitoris to keep the pleasure rich and varied. Female masturbation was different from a male one, and I already understood that pleasing a pussy was more complicated than the simple up and down motion of masturbating with a dick.<br />
<br />
As my pleasure ramped up I began to think about the differences between my male and female bodies that I was too afraid to consider before and what is to come. <br />
<br />
My body odor is already changing from a girl’s to a woman’s and as I developed more and more, pheromones would be produced in my body and waft out of me in order to attract men&#39;s attention. In turn my brain would develop to be more receptive male pheromones and kindle my passion more easily.<br />
<br />
Actually, I have already seen signs that this was already happening. When I was giving John a blowjob, I easily sniffed the male scent coming from his dick and far from disgusted, I became pleased. Even now, I am smelling semen while masturbating, and it feels extremely good. In turn, now that I think about it, when John was liking my nipples, he also took some time to smell my neck so I think that I am producing pheromones already. <br />
<br />
Men had big penises to direct pee wherever they wanted, instead I, as the new owner of a pussy, would need to sit down on the toilet, squirt pee on the bowl and wipe off my vagina with toilet paper. It takes more space, more privacy and to keep an eye that there is indeed paper in the bathroom. I am not worried about that in the house, but in less than a week I will go to school. Besides very few circumstances when I had stomach problems, I have never sat down on the toilet during school hours, if I had to poop, I would just wait to reach home; now that I will need to sit down each time to pee, I fear that I am going to experience the gender differences head on.<br />
<br />
Thinking about school, my now growing breast would be a huge difference in my life and how I interact with others. Previously I considered that I would grow average breasts and fit in with the other girls, but after seeing the progenitor of my body, it was more likely that my boobs would grow massive and heavy. I would probably experience boys staring at my chest instead of my face very often, I just hope that they don’t try to ‘touch me by accident’ or anything of the like.<br />
<br />
Girls didn&#39;t need to carry a ballsack nor testicles because they didn&#39;t need to produce semen to impregnate women with, but instead I would have to experience the maturation and disposal of my eggs every month in a process that I was told was rather unpleasant. Honestly not having to carry something dangling between my legs made me happy, but bleeding from my crotch didn&#39;t sound nice. Now that my buds started to form, the doctors told me after a check up that I should expect menstruation to start in one or two years. Honestly, part of the reason for my training is to prepare my body for my first period since I was told that exercising girls are less likely to experience menstrual pains or change in moods. <br />
<br />
However, one of the more dramatic changes would be sex. I could totally abstain from intercourse and avoid any potential problems, but after feeling the joy of an orgasm and the happiness of experiencing the moment with others, I think that I would not be able to restrain myself. The problem is that if I let any boy cum inside of me without protection I would be the one getting pregnant and having to carry the baby. More shocking though, is that the idea of carrying a life within me didn’t sound so bad right now. It was not difficult for me to think that in the future I may willingly let a man impregnate me<br />
<br />
It’s clear that I am starting to think more like a girl already, and not even the fact that I still liked women made me feel more manly. After my therapist mentioned that women are more sexually fluid than men, I searched on the internet and discovered that the reason many women possess this evolutionary trait is probably so that in the past they could have sex with their co-wives in polygynous marriages and reduce conflict. So a case could be made that being bisexual makes me more nurturing instead of manly…<br />
<br />
With all this thinking about pregnancy and nurturing a naughty idea began to form in my mind. If I was older… and fertile I definitely wouldn’t dare to do this, but right now…<br />
<br />
I quickly stood up and almost fell down due to my legs feeling a bit wobbly, my heart was racing and my love juices were running through my thighs and even dripping to the floor<br />
<br />
I looked through my desk and I found it… a pair of scissors. With anxious energy I cut the ring of the condom that I was carrying, and place the scissors back in my desk<br />
<br />
Laying on the bed again, I start to second guess myself for a brief moment, but the curiosity and excitement is too much to stop at this point<br />
<br />
Inserting my middle finger in my pussy, I note with excitement that I can take it entirely and I am ready for the grand finale<br />
<br />
With care I slide the open end of the condom into my pussy and start to squish the other end like a toothpaste about to run out.<br />
<br />
My heart starts to beat wildly as I imagine the baby juice slowly flowing through the rubber about to reach my pussy, and soon after I feel a lukewarm substance entering my insides.<br />
<br />
To my surprise I feel a movement of the muscles of my lower abdomen as if the pussy recognised that I am offering semen and it is trying to swallow and move it to my deepest parts.<br />
<br />
Unable to resist anymore, I take out the empty preservative and penetrate myself with my middle finger. I almost cannot believe that I just inserted the condom that was inside Mariah a moment ago and poured John’s semen to the innermost part of my vagina, but the thought of John’s tadpoles swimming inside myself is enough to send me into a frenzy and I start to slide my finger in and out like an animal<br />
<br />
The room is filled with the wet sounds of my naughty nectar and John’s semen being stirred inside my pussy and my lewd moans. Not before long, the moment of animalistic carnal urge makes my pleasure reach its climax and I feel extreme euphoria and the same sensation of pissing myself that I experienced before.<br />
<br />
Finally satisfied, I try to calm my ragged breath as I rest limp on the bed. Smiling, I feel the mixture of semen and my juices gushing outside of my pussy. <br />
<br />
The future as a girl may be a bit challenging, but it definitely has its good parts as well; as I think that, I feel my restless emotions settle down and think to myself that I am ready to  face the world head on as a girl.</p>
