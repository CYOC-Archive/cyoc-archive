<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I arrived back at Rod&#39;s, let an excited Biddy into the house and decided to take him for a walk. So after putting on some sandshoes took him around the block. Rod&#39;s car was in the driveway when I returned.<br />
<br />
Sarah greeted me with &quot;Where have you been? You need to get ready&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s only quarter past 5&quot; I replied. &quot;I&#39;m not being picked up till 7.30&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I intend to make you the &#39;Belle of the Ball. And we are going to need all that time. No longer shit, shave and shower for you&quot; he replied. &quot;I have been shopping for extra supplies&quot; I noticed a variety of shopping bags on the kitchen bench &quot;Have a shower in the en suite. while I set up in the bathroom&quot;. He handed me two plastic bottles. &quot;Use these to wash your hair. Don&#39;t forget to use the conditioner&quot;<br />
<br />
I took the bottles to the shower, located a clean towel and had just removed my shirt when There was a knock and the door opened &quot;Put these on when you have finished&quot; said Sarah as he hung a shopping bag and the silk dressing gown on a hook behind the door. &quot;While I&#39;m here show me your underarms&quot; I held my arms in the air. &quot;Mmm a shave would do no harm&quot; He pointed to a razor on the bench &quot;Use that one&quot; he left closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
I got in the shower, washed first my body then my hair and conditioned as instructed. Shaving the underarms took less than a minute. Sarah had left me a very neat little patch of pubic hair which I did not think needed any attention.<br />
<br />
I got out, dried myself and opened the shopping bag. Inside was a black bra and panty set with labels still attached. I pulled them out. It was a G-String. This is going to be a new experience I thought. . <br />
<br />
I had a little difficulty determining how to put the G-String on. The first attempt left the string on the front. Eventually I pulled it up and felt the &#39;String&#39; between my bum cheeks. It was not as uncomfortable as it looked. I put the dressing gown on over the top and went to find Sarah. <br />
<br />
He was in the bathroom and beckoned me to sit on a kitchen chair that was placed there. &quot;I just need to put in a pad&quot; I said and went to open the draw where the pads were kept. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you can&#39;t wear a pad tonight. I&#39;ll get a Tampon. How heavy are you?&quot; Another new experience I thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just spotting&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
He went back to Rod&#39;s bedroom and came back with what I assumed was a tampon. I had no idea where from. &quot;Easiest if I just put this in. Stand there and hold your gown up&quot; I pulled the gown up above my waist. Sarah knelt down and in front of me, and in a matter of fact manner pulled the G-string down and inserted the tampon into my vagina. None of the tenderness from last night or this morning. &quot;If you are only bleeding lightly this will last till you are back home. Pull the string to remove it&quot; He pulled the G-String back up &quot;Sit down and we will get started&quot;<br />
<br />
I sat down and he dried and brushed my hair. When finished he lay a towel over my waist and took my hand and looked at my nails. They were clean but I thought they needed a cut. He said &quot;I don&#39;t normally wear nail polish but I want to experiment. You&#39;re like a big live doll..... This is a girls dream&quot; He applied red polish to the index finger on my right hand and a mauve color to the same finger on my left hand. &quot;Which do you think? I like the mauve&quot; Without waiting for an answer he stripped the polish off both fingers. &quot;First I&#39;ll apply a base coat&quot; he put a clear varnish over all my fingernails &quot;Keep them still. I will do your toes while they dry&quot; The process continued. After the base coat he applied two top coats of the mauve polish to each finger and toe nail. We had to allow 5 minutes between each coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to start on your hair&quot; he said as the final coat on my nails was drying &quot;Would you like a drink first?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love a drink of water....... Haven&#39;t you had already done my hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to curl it&quot; He held a glass of water so I could have a drink. I was not allowed to hold it myself because the nails were still drying.<br />
<br />
He then produced a bunch of clips that he put in my hair and from one of the shopping bags pulled out a box &quot;This is a GHD curling iron. I&#39;ve been meaning to buy one for months&quot; He removed a wand like device from the box, plugged it into a socket then proceeded to work on my hair. Section by section he twisted strands of hair in the hot wand, he held the hair twisted for a few seconds then released it and worked on another strand. Eventually he turned the power off and said &quot;I think I&#39;m done. Give your hair a shake&quot; I did so. He ran his fingers through the hair and seemed satisfied with what he had created. <br />
<br />
He then grabbed one of the aerosol cans that was on the bench and sprayed over my hair. &quot;That should help the curls last&quot; He checked my nails &quot;They are dry now you can touch things if you want&quot; I immediately felt my hair. It felt like a mass of curls. I turned and looked in the mirror. I certainly looked different and I thought my new hairstyle was very attractive. As Zach I had always admired girls with curls.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not done yet&quot; said Sarah &quot;Sit back down&quot; He produced some tweezers and scissors and examined my face. I couldn&#39;t help but wince as he decided to pluck some hairs from my eyebrows &quot;Try and stay still&quot; I was instructed. <br />
<br />
When that was finished he started with makeup. He dipped his fingers into a small bottle and gently rubbed a cream all over my face &quot;This is just moisturizer&quot; he said as he massaged it in. &quot;Next some foundation&quot; He dabbed something onto my face with a sponge, again massaging it in. This was followed by some sort of paintbrush &quot;A bit of color&quot; as he brushed my cheeks.<br />
Eventually he put the brush down looking satisfied &quot;Are we finished?&quot; I asked, estimating I had been sitting here for close to an hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. Eyes next&quot; He produced a pencil and drew on my eyebrows. &quot;Close your eyes&quot; I did. I felt him gently rub something onto my eyelids. &quot;Keep them closed while I put on some eyeliner&quot; It felt like he used a texta to draw on my eyelashes. &quot;Ok open your eyes while I apply Mascara. Try not to flinch&quot; It was hard not to close my eyes again as he brushed my lashes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the lips to go. Try to keep them still while I apply liner&quot; He drew on my lips with a what appeared to be a red texta. I must have moved at the wrong time as he wiped his first effort off with a damp tissue and began again. This time I made sure I didn&#39;t flinch. When he was happy with the result he produced a tube of dark red lipstick and applied it to my lips. &quot;I&#39;ll put this in your clutch bag. Remember to re-apply after the meal&quot; He then sprayed my face with another can and said &quot;All done. Have a look&quot;<br />
<br />
I spun around to look in the mirror behind me. The makeup was flawless. I certainly looked like a girl ready for a night out. To my own taste I thought it was a bit overdone. The face I currently wore did not need a lot of makeup to look good, but I didn&#39;t want to hurt Sarah&#39;s feelings. &quot;Sensational&quot; I said. It was his turn to blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to get dressed&quot; he said. I got up and followed him to the guest bedroom. The Silver dress was laid on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you prefer stockings or pantyhose?&quot; he asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s easier&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pantyhose. But stockings look better&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pantyhose will do&quot; I said. He told me to sit on the bed and he handed me a pack of skin tone pantyhose. I pulled them up my legs. Once they were up above my knees I stood up undid the sash on my gown and pulled them all the way up. &quot;Why give me a G-String if I am to cover it up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled &quot;So you don&#39;t have a panty-line in the dress. Take the gown off and let me see how that bra fits&quot; I did so. &quot;I chose it because of the thin shoulder straps. Is it comfortable? I couldn&#39;t try it on in this body&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit tight&quot; He adjusted the straps<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that better?&quot; I nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see how it looks under the dress&quot; She undid some clips at the back of the dress and bade me lean forward &quot;I&#39;ll help so we don&#39;t ruin the hair&quot; <br />
<br />
Eventually we got it on, he fastened the dress at my back and examined the fit. &quot;That bra isn&#39;t right&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Mum suggested a strapless bra last night&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would look better without a bra. Let&#39;s see&quot; He helped me partially undo the dress, remove the bra and clip the dress back up again. &quot;It looks better.... Move around and see how it feels&quot; I must have looked puzzled. &quot;Pretend you&#39;re dancing. Does is chafe?&quot;<br />
<br />
I twirled around and generally wobbled my chest. It was still a strange sensation having breasts that bounced when I moved. I could feel my nipples against the dress material. &quot;Yes there is a bit of chaffing&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a strapless bra. Let&#39;s see if I can find it&quot; He looked through the underwear drawer and pulled out another black bra. &quot;Try this&quot; Another round of partially undressing and redressing and Sarah was finally satisfied with my look. I twirled and wobbled. Everything felt comfortable as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;That looks good. Now for some jewellery. Marlene will be here soon&quot; He proceeded to put some earrings in my pierced ears. &quot;These pendants will look nice. They are not real diamonds but no-one will know&quot; He then found some silver bangles and put one on each wrist &quot;These were from my grandmothers estate, don&#39;t lose them&quot;<br />
<br />
Lastly some shoes were produced &quot;Put these on. You might need to practice walking&quot; He produced a pair of silver shoes. The heels must have been 4 inches. &quot;I wore these at Monique&#39;s wedding, they are remarkably comfortable&quot; <br />
<br />
I put the shoes on and found I was almost looking Sarah eye to eye. I walked to the kitchen and back. I wouldn&#39;t call them comfortable but I could cope. I had worn 4 inch heels the first night I had become Sarah, if anything these shoes were easier to wear.<br />
<br />
Sarah handed me a little handbag with a long metal strap &quot;Take this clutch. The lipstick, other necessities and your phone are in there&quot;<br />
It was now 7.30 Marlene would be here shortly. Sarah walked with me to the curb. I practiced trying to walk gracefully, up and down the driveway as we waited for the taxi. I had only done two laps when we saw the taxi coming. <br />
<br />
Sarah walked me to the car, opened the door and said hello to Marlene. I went to hop in but Sarah held me back. He pulled me around, gave me a kiss and said &quot;Have a good evening but remember you are my fiancé. I will wait up for you&quot;</p>
