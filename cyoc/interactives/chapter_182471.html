<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">39 year-old Gillian Larson looked at her son 16-year-old son Jake. <br />
<br />
”Well Jake dear it seems I get first pick” <br />
<br />
Jack was still a little ticked off about losing but fair is fair and he lost. <br />
<br />
&quot;What will it be, mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna keep it anomynous , just wait and see hun. Also keep an eye on the kitchen.”  Gillian moved the monitor away from her son and began typing <br />
<br />
Jake kept an eye on the lunch his mother was making as she typed away. His mother is a very smart woman, and she is a high ranking corporate lawyer, the Larson household wasn&#39;t super-rich but they lived in an upper-middle-class neighborhood and didn&#39;t have to worry about money that much if at all.  <br />
As Gillian typed the final commands, she had a nice grin on her face. As she walked back to the kitchen, gesturing Jake to step away as she took over the cooking. <br />
<br />
”Having fun there Mom?” <br />
<br />
”Oh I will be in a little bit.” <br />
<br />
Jake felt a little weird, he felt a little burning sensation but it wasn&#39;t like he was on fire, more like something like a warm massage with coals. Jake was sweating a little bit. He felt his back shift a bit and he noticed he was at eye level with his mom making him about 5’8”. He looked into her green eyes and noticed a pair of identical green eyes reflecting back at him. Then his blonde hair was growing and reaching to his mid-back before turning the same shade of red his mother had. It finally dawned on him <br />
<br />
”Mom I am turning it to you!” Realizing he was talking with his mom’s voice <br />
<br />
”Took you long enough, Jake I&#39;ll be completely honest with you, I never really liked the whole being a mother thing, to me you have always been an expensive burden, a mistake due to my poor planning in my younger years, a pit of time and money I am never getting back. I mean, I will say at least you are an okay kid, but my poor planning cost me my twenties and most of my thirties doing shit I hate, while I could have been spending time with well, myself.”  Dropping a bombshell to her son while still focused on her meal. <br />
<br />
”Mom this is fucking crazy, what will happen to my friends, my school work,...my existence” feeling himself fading as his hips widened, his waist narrowed, ass expanded, stomach flattened, and he grew the nice perky D cups his mom had. <br />
<br />
Gillian made an effort to take care of her killer sexy body no matter how tired it made her. <br />
<br />
”First young man, you haven&#39;t fully become me yet so watch your tone! Second, don&#39;t worry about that stuff, I took that into account, Jake Larson will have never existed, so your friends and school don&#39;t have to worry. Trust me you&#39;ll like being me, you did say how much you hate school work and how you could be a smart and successful person like me.” <br />
<br />
”Mom..... I..... I....” Jake tried to hold on but as his penis and testicles retreated into his body, the clothes on him changing into the same maxi sundress his mother had on, his mind and existence were sealed, erased, and replaced with a carbon copy of Gillian’s <br />
<br />
Gillian looked at her clone with glee. <br />
<br />
”... Must say we have done a pretty amazing job with this one Gillian!” Gillian2 said before putting on apron identical to the original Gillian<br />
<br />
”Thank you, Gillian, wow you&#39;re already doing great helping me out with lunch,” Gillian1 said <br />
<br />
After the pair was done making lunch they looked at each other and wanted to take a nice bubble bath. It was just amazing having that time with herself. After lunch, Gillian 1 and 2 sat on the couch and binge-watched their favorite trashy reality tv shows, in between commercials they would plan everything for the upcoming week for work and workouts. Having two Gillians in the office will increase productivity and the size of the two Gillian&#39;s bank accounts. Plus she has a new workout buddy. They also kissed in between plans. They decided not to make dinner tonight and ordered delivery. When meeting the delivery guy Gillian1 noticed a new sports car in the driveway, new memories hit her head, they use the sports car on the weekend if they need to go out. After getting inside Gillian1 notices Gillian2 working on the Chronivac. <br />
<br />
”What are you doing there, Gillian?” <br />
<br />
”Just finishing something we need to get done” Gillian2 said with pleasure <br />
<br />
<br />
She uninstalled and wiped the program, before destroying the Chronivac Box. Effectively wiping Jake from existence and ever coming back. <br />
<br />
Gillian1 then looked at herself, her beautiful, smart, feminine self, she was finally truly happy in 16 years, she found her soulmate and fixed the biggest mistake of her life. She let out tears, and Gillian2 hugged her. <br />
<br />
”Let it out, I know how long we have wanted this!” Before she started crying too. <br />
<br />
Gillian 1 and 2 ate dinner and fed each other while enjoying wine and their own company. After dinner, the couple walked to their bedroom and they stripped at the same time. It was so erotic seeing someone just like her undress, the same beautiful body complete mirror images right back at each other. She held her hand out and they made it to the bed. Gillian1 was direct and pinned her clone to the bed and began to pleasure her starting with the neck then the breasts. Gillian1 knew just where to be when having sex. Gillian2 shoved her finger inside the original&#39;s slit and knew just where to maximize the pleasure. Gillian1 orgasmed so hard as Gillian2 just kept going hitting the spot every time. It wasn&#39;t long before Gillian2’s pussy was in Gillian1’s face and Gillian1 loved to taste her pussy. It was delightful. Gillian2 grabbed their favorite vibrator and they shared it achieving mutual orgasm even squirting. After what felt like hours Gillian1 and Gillian2 basked in the afterglow of their narcissistic lovemaking. Gillian1 was so happy, she was finally with herself until the very end.</p>
