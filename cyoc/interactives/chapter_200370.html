<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...A bunny costume.<br />
<br />
Most of the animal costumes you see around here are loose, baggy disguise pajamas, the exact kind of thing you could doze off in on a warm Friday night. Tigers, bears, cheetahs… they’re all nice, but you could have worn this kind of stuff as an adult male and get away with it, in the right context. No, you’re looking for something outlandish, the kind of costume which would only exist in a magical disguise shop. Your search brings you to the Animal Aisle, where you find the most peculiar white rabbit.<br />
<br />
The bunny is vacuum-packed into a plastic bag, along with her accessories. After a few futile minutes of picking at the seams with your wimpy kid fingers, you ask the shopkeeper to help crack the package. She happily tears the top open in one swift motion, letting you bring it to a changing room and spill the contents on the floor.<br />
<br />
FLUMP, goes the bunny skin. It’s got a dense coat of fur on the outside, but it hit the ground hard and bounced. How did it get so heavy and rigid? You search the costume from front to back yet find no trace of a zipper. You open the bunny’s mouth… and what do you know, no teeth. The inside of the suit is made of a slick pink latex, smooth and seamless, dripping with shining lubricant. Underneath the fur the bunny’s skin is thick, so thick, two millimeters at its thinnest joints- yet when you stretch the jaws on that mask, it parts as easily as an elastic waistband. That settles it, this thing is definitely some sort of magic, you HAVE to try it on.<br />
<br />
The fairy costume comes off piece by piece. Halfway through you pause and wait to see how your body reacts, but you remain a child. Something between fear and relief courses through your little heart. Shaking with adrenaline, you peel off the tights and underpants, then grab a squeeze bottle from the bunny suit’s package. The label says it’s a cleaning agent to keep bacteria from growing on you while in costume. It smells harsh, but the label insists it’s “tear free”. Rubbing it on your skin gives you a pleasant burning sensation as the dirt on your body is repelled and falls away. <br />
<br />
There’s no more delaying it, as if you ever wanted to. Facing the bunny away from your body, you pull their fuzzy white face as wide apart as it can go and sit on your butt as you scoot both legs inside. After you make it past the suit’s neck, it’s not too different from putting on the tights you were wearing a few minutes ago. With the lubricant taking away all the friction, the tightness of the rubber suit almost feels like rippling muscle guiding you deeper inside until you hit a pair of firm and squishy pockets at the end.<br />
<br />
The bunny paws wrapping around your feet from toe to ankle are coated in sleek white fur, even on the soles of your feet. You flex your new three-toed paws against the resistance of the latex and giggle to yourself. The peculiar trim of the faux fur makes your paws look flat like those of a cartoon, with no arch or ankle in sight. Is the whole costume really this amazing?<br />
<br />
Unrolling the suit up your legs feels slow, but the shape-memory of the rubbery shell is eager to snap itself back into the shape it was molded in. The material is thick- SO, so thick- it embraces your calves and teasingly tugs against your knees when you bend at the joint. It’s all bliss and contentment until you hit the cross of your legs, and-<br />
<br />
“Oh… oh wow…”<br />
<br />
A blush creeps across your face. It looks like this suit is meant for long-term wear. You hold your breath by reflex as you use one finger to push a self-cleaning sterile tube into your butthole, only to exhale and whine as you feel a pinch and your body clenches. When you feel a small POP, you extract your finger and pant, tears forming in your eyes. The tube reseals itself, which is probably a good thing. A second, deeper tube connects to your sex; it looks like it will be flush with your inner walls. With a second squirt of antibacterial fluid on your hands, you smooth out the inside of the tube and-<br />
<br />
“Mmmwooooah…”<br />
<br />
The inside isn’t all that exciting, but when it rubs on your lower lips it tickles in a way you’ve never felt before. Strange warmth fills your being, and not just because it’s actually really hot inside the rubber suit. It takes a few seconds to remember what you were doing, but after regaining your presence of mind you gladly shimmy the costume up over your hips. Everything between your thighs and pelvis is coated in a centimeter-thick plush layer of faux bunny skin which thins at the waist, leaving you with comically feminine hips while your paws look relatively dainty next to them. Your coccyx- your “tailbone”, you remember- is now graced with a puffy, pointy bunny tail which twitches slightly when you move. In a moment of self-awareness, you take a moment to smooth your fur over your crotch, and the molded latex sex is covered up as modestly as an ordinary pair of pants. The tickling is still there, though, not just under the suit but seemingly on its surface, too.<br />
<br />
With closed eyes and a wide smile, you cup your left hand over your crotch while you unroll the costume up your waist until it hits your armpits. The molding of the stiff costume is pinching your waist inwards like a corset tightened to 2 centimeters. You take a few breaths as deep as you can, swaying your hips to help the latex up your body as your paws manage to grip the tile floor even through a layer of bunny fluff. The combination of squeezing around your waist and tingling between your legs is making your toes curl and your breath turn ragged. You indulge yourself in one more firm grope before you continue, inhaling all the way and exhaling all the way, not allowing yourself to hyperventilate.<br />
<br />
Here comes the really hard part. Stretching the mouth on that bunny as far as it can go, you pull your right hand into its sleeve and slide it all the way until it reaches the glove at the end. The rubber sleeve narrows after the elbow and levels out near the end of the wrist, easing your hand inside while still holding the glove firm. Your middle and ring finger both fit into the same extra-large slot on the four-fingered glove, leaving your hand as dexterous as it can be inside the generous layer of latex and faux fur. The costume’s hand-paw is now YOUR hand-paw. <br />
<br />
Marveling at the firm grasp your fluffy paw has without any visible paw pads, you stretch the costume once more and ease your other arm inside. The flex of your left hand inside that glove offers a curious resistance when you make a fist. With a distorted expression on its face, the bunny costume’s mouth begins to contract as you pull your sleeves snug until it comes to a stop around your neck. You tug it upwards slightly to free your airway and sigh. You aren’t even done, and already your body feels exalted in the full-body hug the bunny suit is giving you. The tingling between your legs still hasn’t faded, though, and your heart beats heavily underneath the extra-fluffy neck ruff on top of your chest. <br />
<br />
“Where is it…?” You’re digging around in the costume package, only faintly noticing that you can still feel textures through the paw-gloves even if you can’t quite feel temperatures. There it is- a snug Lycra wig-cap to hold your hair in place under the hood. Your wavy brown hair is packed tight under the fabric, leaving your head looking even smaller than it actually is. That’s not even the last of it, because you follow that with a pair of dense foam earplugs which fit firmly in your ears without digging in too far. You hear a crackle as the microphones in those earplugs come to life; already they’re linked up to the ears on your bunny head. Opening up a sterile case, you take out a thin, pink silicone domino mask and stick its adhesive side to your face. As you blink a few times, the high-definition digital eyes on the mask’s lenses match your movements; the VR camera feed on the inside grants a view of the changing room through the screens. A human being with tall, oblong eyes the size of soup spoons and red, golf-ball-sized irises would look uncanny and bizarre, but you’re not going to be a human in a moment. <br />
<br />
Steeling your nerves, you stretch the mouth one more time and pull it over your face. Your arms are starting to get sore from all this work, but it’s worth it to feel the snug cradle of the rubbery shell surrounding you, and the warmth of your furry coat. The world looks askew for a moment as your digital eyes are obscured, but it only takes a second of adjustment to fit them flush with the eye holes on the costume. Thanks to more of that mild adhesive, your eyes look almost natural, and even have functioning eyelids with long, dark, straight eyelashes now that they have skin surrounding them. Your head is probably the most heavily padded part of this costume, all to simplify it into a cartoonish rounded sphere with long, flopsy ears and a few tall tufts of fur on top resembling a woman’s hairstyle. All that is left… is your mouth.<br />
<br />
“Aaaaaaghhgl.” Now it’s your turn to open wide. The “mouth kit” for your costume is literally the entire inside of a mouth, teeth, tongue and all, all the way to the opening of the esophagus. Though whoever designed this thing ensured the rubbery tube entering your body was as buttery-smooth as possible, no amount of engineering could stop a normal person from gagging when a foreign object touches their throat. Not only that, but you taste the bitter tang of that disinfectant on the kit’s surface, and only the label’s insistence that it is “non-toxic” makes you confident enough to swallow. As you cry tears of pain, the drops travel through artificial tear ducts in your mask, and your delicate pink bunny nose starts to drip. Even your digital irises start to wobble in a sine wave as if they too were tearing up, and your eyelids stretch in concern. You wipe your face with a tissue from the pack included in the costume bag- ah, so that’s why it was there.<br />
<br />
“Click” go your extra-hard ceramic rabbit teeth as you move your dentures. You run your flat bunny tongue along the roof of your artificial mouth, not really thinking about why you are still able to taste through a rubber skin. The costume still looks slightly off… but then you understand the last accessory in the bag; a screw-cap tube of a much stronger adhesive, one which would harden like silicone caulk and render your disguise permanent. You don’t even hesitate as you bare your teeth and spread a line of the clear, sticky stuff along the rim of the mouth kit, then press it against the inside of the lips of your bunny mask. A short set of instructions on the tube insist it will only set properly if you press down on it for at least five minutes, so you keep your mouth closed for the time being. The extra fuzziness around your lips makes your mouth near invisible when closed, completing the look.<br />
<br />
 In every possible respect, you’ve taken on the appearance of an animated cartoon bunny- at least, that’s how it looks on the outside. Inside of this costume, your four-year-old girl body is wrapped in a warm, smooth, heavy, comforting embrace which presses on you from every angle. Simply walking around is a surreal experience as your lopped ears swing in and out of the edges of your digital vision. Thanks to your extra-wide hips, you find yourself involuntarily swaying in a feminine manner. Your foot-paws are noticeably elevated off the ground and squish with every step, yet the costume is so tight that you feel like you’ve shrunk slightly. When you bend your joints, your fur is so dense that you don’t even see any wefts or creases form.<br />
<br />
As the suit detects your full body heat, it activates a small vacuum pump hidden behind your tail. The last bubbles of air are sucked away, decreasing the resistance against your movements and improving your mobility. Out of curiosity, you tug on your tail and try to activate it again… and it does! The suction briefly pulls your body tighter, forcing you to your knees with your hands clasped in your lap and your chin pointed high. With your extra padding, that not only didn’t hurt, it felt kind of nice… you give yourself another grope with one hand, and feel at your nipples with the other, all ten of your nipples. So… so thick…<br />
<br />
“Are you finished in there?”<br />
<br />
GAH! The shopkeeper shocks you out of your… private moment. “I’m all- I’m all dressed, hehe.” This isn’t even the girl voice you had before, you sound like an adult woman doing a child voice for a cartoon. Is there a voice changer in the costume? You stand up and shield your crotch with both hand-paws, feet pointed inwards and pigeon-toed. Hidden lights in your fur cause an artificial blush to form on your cheeks.<br />
<br />
If the shopkeeper heard or saw any of the “exploration” you were doing a moment ago, she isn’t acknowledging it. “You look PRECIOUS,” she says. “If I didn’t watch you come in here with a costume, I’d swear you were a real rabbit!”<br />
<br />
“You… mean it?”<br />
<br />
“Yup. In fact, I think I know exactly the kind of adventure a bun like you would want to go on.”<br />
<br />
“YOU DO?” Like magic, you find yourself hopping up and down on the balls of your feet. “Where? What kind?”<br />
<br />
“You’d never believe me, but…”</p>
