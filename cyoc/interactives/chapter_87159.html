<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The journey from where the council met to where Sally&#39;s sisterhood was a quiet one. You were privately relieved that you could feel the teen&#39;s platonic love  for sirens feed you. Some of it was a great shock, as it also meant that you had the same platonic love (friendship) with the teen, which you hadn&#39;t expected. It struck you as the result of what Florencia had done to transform you. Your mind and instincts were changing... accepting what had happened as you continued to produce siren magic. The only thing that gave you hope was that your love for Selene would prevent you from deciding to remain a siren yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much farther do we have to go?&quot; you asked to Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much further,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;My sisterhood&#39;s established a cave grotto under the beach house my parents own... It&#39;s a rather comfy arrangement that can allow us to safely and privately travel between the ocean and the land...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame you and Selene don&#39;t live right on the beach,&quot; Elizabeth commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was still an exile when I meet Michael,&quot; Selene told Elizabeth, &quot;and since he didn&#39;t believe me when I first told him about what I am... when we married and began looking for a house to live in... he didn&#39;t chose to live right on the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you do live close to it, right?&quot; the teen asked, looking to you and then glancing forward to Selene.<br />
<br />
The swim from the council area wasn&#39;t very far, but it did prove to be farther than the teen could easily swim on his own. After a few moments, you and Elizabeth were forced to come along side him and grip his arms to hold him up while using your own tails to propel you through the water. And now you were beginning to approach what looked like a large tunnel that seemed to go into the beach itself. You didn&#39;t know how the sand held the firmness to form the tunnel, but you didn&#39;t stop to ponder it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close enough... though the spot we live near is where Florencia lives with her sisterhood,&quot; you commented, &quot;though... if things go well... she will have to recognize my wife as a fellow head-sister and accept another sisterhood sharing the same town and area and we can then share the beach... though it would have to be privately...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if you can&#39;t go back to being a human man again?&quot; the teen wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that happens... Florencia would face potential execution as a point of justice and for interfering in another head-sister&#39;s affairs,&quot; Sally explained as she motioned you all into the tunnel, &quot;and Selene would become the head-sister for the entire sisterhood...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you would be welcome,&quot; Elizabeth answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys have a lot of rules...&quot; the teen commented with a shrug as you and Elizabeth helped him into the tunnel. It was deep enough that he&#39;d have to swim, but narrow enough that it wouldn&#39;t accommodate the three of you together.<br />
<br />
&quot;It prevents there being trouble,&quot; Sally chuckled, &quot;Go on in. Emily should be waiting for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen nodded and you and Elizabeth followed close behind. Sally and Selene followed after you. The tunnel was fairly dim with only a periodic lantern hanging from the ceiling for illumination and it seemed to go on for about a hundred yards. Journeying down it gave you a look at the end of the tunnel, which looked more brightly illuminated as though the room beyond was more brightly lit. You eventually moved into it to find yourself in a large underground cave centered around an underground pool. There were several electric flood lights that served to illuminate the cave with their wires going up to a spiral staircase that seemed to come down from the roof the cave. You guessed that it led up into the home that Sally&#39;s mother and father lived in. Your marveling at the construction didn&#39;t last long as you heard a teenage girl&#39;s voice cry out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake! Jake! It&#39;s you!&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked over to see a teenage girl sitting on what looked like a beach chair on the floor of the cave with a few other women sitting around her. She got up and practically ran toward the pool, leaped into the air and dove in. As she went underwater, you could only watch as she changed. Long gills formed on her back and were hidden by her long hair. He legs seemed to painlessly wither and shrink away, while her spine lengthened and pushed out. At first the tail looked more like a snake&#39;s tail than a fish or a whale&#39;s tail, but as it grew longer, neon green scales became visible and at the end of the tail, her tail flukes, a bright orange, also developed and enlarged with her tail as it grew out longer and longer until it was as long as her legs had been. This had to be Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jake... I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Emily cried as she swam up to the teen, Jake, and began hugging him and then kissing him, &quot;and... and you still love me... you love me! Oh... thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t protect you, Em,&quot; Jake answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, so long as we&#39;re together forever,&quot; Emily answered and then noticed you and Elizabeth floating nearby. It was then that her voice soured a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;You?! Who are you?&quot; Emily demanded, &quot;What do you want? You... you didn&#39;t bring my love here to eat him did you? You monsters!&quot;<br />
<br />
The accusation made you feel a bit guilty, as you had felt the same way about yourself after feeding on the two men, and you slunk away for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not monsters!&quot; Elizabeth answered after a brief recoil and moving to you, &quot;We&#39;re going to be your sisters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You brought my boyfriend here! I expected this council member to bring him here!&quot; Emily charged, just as Selene and Sally arrived.<br />
<br />
Sally was quick to recognize the problem and moved to get between you and Emily as the young teen had moved to put herself between you and Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I did bring him here, but our council meeting was a bit... complicated,&quot; Sally answered, and then gestured to your pregnant wife, &quot;This is head-sister Selene. She is the head-sister of the sisterhood my mother and I were talking to you about...&quot; she then gestured to you and Elizabeth, &quot;and these are members of her sisterhood. The blond is Elizabeth, and she was born a siren. The other is Michelle... and she was originally a he... and is Selene&#39;s husband and father of her unborn child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they aren&#39;t here to take Jake from me?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dear,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;and if you&#39;d wish it... I&#39;d be more than willing to be your head-sister and welcome your Jake as a brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily gave a sort of an embarrassed blush and backed away for a moment, &quot;Sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;You were defending the man you love... I&#39;d have done the same if I could have been there to deal with Florencia...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily raised an eyebrow in confusion and you gave a sigh, knowing you&#39;d have to tell her your story.</p>
