<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anyway... Today was Sunday and it felt like any other day. Well okay, it wasn&#39;t exactly like any other day. By now my Dad would have usually come into my room and badger me about my body. But its noon already and he hasn&#39;t come up to my room once. Come to think of it, he was unusually quiet when we were having breakfast. Maybe he finally gave up trying to &quot;fix&quot; me? &quot;Knock, Knock&quot; Or not...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming in, son.&quot; Without waiting for me to answer, my Dad (His name is Adam by the way) opened the door and came into my room. He was wearing nothing but a wife beater and boxers. He would always strut around the house in them, partly because he just liked to, partly because he wanted to remind me how he looked. &quot;Dad, and here I thought you&#39;d finally given up on...&quot; &quot;Wait hear me out this time!&quot; my Dad said as he closed the door. &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about why you&#39;ve been reluctant in getting stronger, and I think I get it now. You just don&#39;t want to put in the effort, yeah?&quot; &quot;Got it in one, Dad.&quot; &quot;Thought so. And I&#39;ve been thinking about that and web surfing and I think I found a solution to this little problem.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s that? Gonna use magic or something?&quot; &quot;Got it in one, son.&quot;<br />
<br />
I must have heard him wrong there. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Dad, but can you repeat that?&quot; &quot;I said you guessed right. I found a magic spell online that will help us here.&quot; &quot;Dad, seriously?! Why don&#39;t you just disown me, if you&#39;re gonna treat me like a dummy!&quot; &quot;I know how this sounds, but bare with me. I was reading about it and plenty people were saying it worked.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s because they were lying!&quot; &quot;But there were videos too.&quot; Anyone can do special effects nowadays!&quot; &quot;But... No wait... I&#39;m doing this wrong. In that case, I&#39;ll promise you this. If it doesn&#39;t work, then I will never bother you again.&quot; &quot;You really mean that?&quot; &quot;If I&#39;m lying than you can disown ME!&quot; There was something in Dad&#39;s eyes that was getting to me. It wasn&#39;t that I believed this stuff, but my Dad was a true believer here. And if he really will stop bothering me, then why not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Okay, I&#39;ll do it your way then.&quot; &quot;Really? You mean it?!&quot; &quot;Yeah, yeah, but you better not be lying about that promise. I&#39;ll be really angry if you do.&quot; &quot;You got it. Oh thank god!&quot; &quot;Please don&#39;t be so relieved.&quot; I closed the video game I was playing and got up to face my dad. I was wearing a plain T-shirt and shorts, a nice contrast with my father. &quot;So what is this magic trick of yours?&quot; &quot;Glad you asked. Well, it just a simple spell. We both have to chant it and then you and I will switch bodies.&quot; &quot;Switch... bodies? You&#39;re joking.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m serious here. If you don&#39;t want to change yourself the hard way, than I&#39;ll just give you my body. And heck, if I&#39;m in your body, I might just gain an understanding about what you go through.&quot; Oh god, this is so dumb!&quot; &quot;It isn&#39;t, and if for some reason, you still don&#39;t like what I have, then that&#39;s it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sigh... Okay, say this does work, how would we switch back anyway?&quot; &quot;We just repeat the spell, but in case we somehow can&#39;t, the spell only lasts one week.&quot; &quot;And what about our lives. I barely know what you do as a living and neither do you with I.&quot; &quot;Apparently, this spell fills your head with the other&#39;s life. But you still be yourself and me myself.&quot; &quot;This is really sounding fake.&quot; &quot;And I&#39;m telling you its not. Just trust me.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t think you understand how hard that is in and of itself, but whatever. I&#39;ll trust you for now, son.&quot; &quot;Great, I hope I won&#39;t disappoint you, Dad.&quot; &quot;Right... so what&#39;s the spell?&quot; <br />
<br />
A few minutes later. &quot;I really am being punked here, aren&#39;t I?&quot; &quot;Once again, I am 100% serious.&quot; If you want to know why I&#39;m so upset still, well at the moment my Dad and I are legit buck naked. Apparently for the spell to work, we need to be as close to each other as physically possible and clothes get in the way of that. That&#39;s bad enough. But by close as possible they really mean close, so in addition to that, our bodies are touching and I mean really touching. Our feet are connected, (Being lighter, my feet are on top of him of course), legs touching. I have my arms around his face and neck area, (We could have hugged normally, but my face doesn&#39;t reach his face) my head buried in his hairy, tough chest. And our penises are touching, which might be the worse thing about this. (His penis is really, really huge). &quot;It really feeling like I&#39;m about to start having sex with you,&quot; I finally said back. &quot;Please don&#39;t remind me,&quot; my Dad replied. I thought I felt his penis twitch in response to that statement, but I&#39;m just gonna ignore that.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, so are you ready?&quot; my Dad asked. &quot;As ready as an 18 year old boy hugging his naked father can be, I guess.&quot; &quot;All right smart-ass. Hope you&#39;re ready to be amazed by this?&quot; &quot;Just start please.&quot; &quot;Okay, okay!... I, Adam Smith do accept this body as my own.&quot; &quot;And I Sebastian Smith accept this body in return.&quot; I pledge this in the name of God, almighty.&quot; &quot;And I as well.&quot; &quot;Let the body of Sebastian Smith become me.&quot; &quot;And let the body of Adam Smith become me.&quot; And finally together. &quot;I accept help from a higher power!! Let us switch bodies and live as the person before me!!&quot; As soon as we finished, I was ready to let go and never speak of it again, but no sooner did we finish speaking, did a shock hit my body. I could feel my Dad flinch, so it must have happened to him too. We let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did... did you feel that?!&quot; &quot;I... I did, but... no... I&#39;m sure it was just some static shock... Ohhh...&quot; &quot;Sebastian...?&quot; &quot;Ohh, I don&#39;t feel so hot.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s wr... Ohhh.... Oh I feel something too... Like a sinking feeling in my stomach.&quot; &quot;Me... me too. No... this must be a placebo effect. There&#39;s just no way...&quot; I blinked a few times and stared down. I noticed my toes. My big, meaty stinky toes. &quot;No. No way, my feet?!&quot; &quot;What about your feet?! Oh my god. They&#39;re huge! They look like my feet and... Oh my god, my feet are so tiny!&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; I looked at my Dad&#39;s feet. They were indeed small and familiarly small too. I just had those feet moments ago. &quot;Oh god, its working!&quot; my Dad yelled out. &quot;NO! No, it can&#39;t! I...&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked back and forth and as I did, my eyes were seeing more and more of my Dad&#39;s face. Looking down, I could have swore my feet were farther away from my body. &quot;Oh boy, I&#39;m getting shorter!&quot; My dad said. Looking back at him, it was hard to tell at first, but I could see more and more of the poster that my Dad was in front of. And it was getting harder to see the bottom. I was now no longer at my Dad&#39;s eye level. Instead, I was having to look down at a man whose face until recently I couldn&#39;t touch with my own head. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taller than me, son!&quot; &quot;I... I...&quot; As my Dad sunk lower from my vision, I noticed he wasn&#39;t as hairy as he used to be and when I looked down, I was getting... &quot;Hair?!&quot; I exclaimed. I was getting hair on my chest. ME?! &quot;No way! No fucking way!&quot; I cursed. This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen. This was suppose to be insane. Well, in a sense, this is insane, but I mean a fake insane. As my chest broadened and a set of ten packs formed over my stomach, I could feel my body explode with power. Muscles forming everywhere, even where I didn&#39;t think it was possible. Looking back at Dad, he was a fucking string bean. Again I cursed. I was always embarrassed to even say them before, but here I was just fucking thinking them. &quot;Goddammit!&quot; <br />
<br />
Cursing again, I watched as my old man didn&#39;t look so old anymore. His head was transforming into something that looked familiar to me. A face I had stared at in a mirror all my life. &quot;You really look like me now.&quot; the kid who was formally my dad said to be in a squeakier voice and yet one I was familiar with. &quot;Oh god, oh god, oh god! I repeated, my voice getting deeper with each exclamation. &quot;We&#39;re almost done, son! No, I should be calling you Dad now.&quot; I looked back at my Dad, who looked like me now, except for one obvious difference. I definitely never had a package like that. But as I watched, they started to shrink, his penis getting smaller and thinner and closer to his pelvis. &quot;I&#39;m definitely gonna miss this big guy, but I guess I&#39;ll have it back sooner rather than later.&quot; As my Dad, nonchalantly described his changes, I felt a warmth spread throughout my groin. Looking down, my pubic hair was basically a bush and a mushroom was growing out from within its confines. It got bigger and bigger and along with my growing testes was starting to weigh me down. As my cock got bigger, it got thicker and eventually harder and straighter. &quot;Oh boy, you&#39;ve got your first erection!&quot; my dad giggled and squealed. &quot;I&#39;ve had an erection before Dad, it&#39;s just... Oh... Oh no!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? What is it?&quot; &quot;Um... Um... I gotta use the toilet!&quot; I ran out of the room as fast as I could and to the bathroom. I could hear my Dad run after me. I burst in and saw the toilet seat down. &quot;No fucking time!&quot; I shouted as I pulled back the shower curtain, aimed my dick and... &quot;Ah... Ah... Gah!&quot; I shot out ejaculate all over the shower wall. It was thick and it was hot. I never felt like this before. As what felt like forever went by, my dick hot and bothered by cumming buckets out finally started to stop. As it did, I could feel information about Dad fill my head, but even so I knew I was still Sebastian Smith deep down. I finally stopped cumming, turned around and slunk onto the ground. Some leftover cum dribbled down my penis and onto my leg, but I was too exhausted to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was quite the show you gave me Daddy.&quot; I looked up and saw my Dad, or well I suppose he&#39;s my son for now, look at me, hand outstretched and looking quite smug. &quot;Don&#39;t get too cocky, boy.&quot; I finally replied as I took his hand and got up. My life was about to get crazier then I ever could have imagined.</p>
