<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A man, clad in strange clothes, odd patterns that looked like rejected knitting designs, and a cape. His eyes looked old and tired and he had a beard which, although not long, was dirty and unkempt. He looked as though his appearance was of no importance to him and for what Clare could tell, he didn't care of the opinions of others either. His boots, long and pointed, were covered in mud, a glove adorn one hand, though it was emblazed with more patterns and colours and his hair was similar to his beard; white and unkempt. He slowly rose from his bed.<br />
<br />
Clare jumped from the seat and was about to scream when the old man put his finger to his lips. Instantly Clare stopped. She wanted to scream but for all her will power she couldn't she just stood and stared at him, terrified, frozen. &quot;Don't be scared my dear, I'm not here to hurt you.&quot; He said. His voice was gruff and deep but reminded Clare of her grandfather at Christmas. It didn't seem menacing and she made no effort to back any further away, though she was against her wall, the door half way between the two of them. &quot;If I wanted to hurt you I would have done it by now.&quot; He stopped his advance forward and sat slowly on the chair which Clare had been in. She took a moment to take in his words before nodding her understanding. &quot;I'm here to give you something. A great gift. I've been watching you for some time. Don't worry, I've kept my distance.&quot; He said spotting the conclusion she had instantly drawn. &quot;I'm here to give this gift to you and depart. You shall hear no more of me ever again. I promise that.&quot; He took off the glove and flexed his fingers in the fresh air. <br />
<br />
&quot;You’re a kind soul Clare, caring, thoughtful, and damn smart too. Quite unlike your sister. I've watched her too. She's not evil mind you but your a rare breed. I've decided that I should impart this to you.&quot; He placed the glove in front of him on the desk and motioned for Clare to pick it up. She looked at him nervously and made a gesture to her voice. &quot;Oh yes right! Sorry!&quot; he said waving his hand. &quot;I always forget something. Its old age I think&quot;<br />
<br />
Clare didn't feel any different but let out a sigh to test her voice again. &quot;Me?&quot; she simply said &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its great power my dear, and I trust you to wield it sensibly. There are a great many people in this world who would not but it must live on in one form or another.&quot; His words made no sense to her but he knew that. &quot;You'll find out all about it in time, but I don't have much to spare. Sadly my dear you'll have to wander this road without me, though I do feel you won't keep it all to yourself. That’s the kind of person you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
He rose from the chair and turned his back on her. &quot;I think you’re smart enough now to know what I'm offering but I shall leave you with this parting gift.&quot; He sat on the bed and flicked his hand upwards in a sharp motion. Instantly Clare's vision was filled with sequins and shining lights and for a moment she was completely disorientated. The next her eyes settled and she was back in her room. Wondering what had just happened, she looked down to see that her casual clothes were gone, instead replaced with the most beautiful ball gown she had ever seen. A bright turquoise, cut low with the back open and flowed down to her ankles, but didn't drag on the floor. She twirled and laughed, feeling it flow on her frame. She giggled like she was a child again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh its wonderful, beautiful. Thank you so...&quot; but he was gone. Her eyes darted around but couldn't see him anywhere. Was that it? Was he gone? For good? Clare felt a touch of panic and sat down on the bed dizzy. She had inferred what he had been saying, arrived at the conclusion he had wanted her to draw but didn't know if it was all true. She lifted her hand and examined it. Still plain and undecorated as before. She hadn't gone to much effort this morning, knowing she wasn't seeing anyone. She took the other hand and thought in her head of what she wanted, then brushed her hand over the other. Instantly the nails were painted in a matching turquoise. She giggled again, at the full reality of what had happened. She brushed the other hand, then her ears, then her face. She rose and stepped into the new shoes on the floor. Walking over to the full length mirror that now hung on her wall she examined the beautiful girl staring back at her. Who only appeared on special evenings of the year; the school ball, occasional parties or formal events. Never had she had the money or the time for such a dress though. It was outstanding.<br />
<br />
What else could she do? What was the limit of this power? What was she going to do with it? It had been trusted to her. Would it be taken back if she abused it? All these questions she didn't have the answer to but she knew that, like the old man had said, she had plenty of time to find out.</p>
