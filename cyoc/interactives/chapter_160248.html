<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron paused while he was trying to think of a solution. Of course, he didn&#39;t want to be older than Edwin, and Edwin knew he didn&#39;t want that either.  Aaron was tempted to have Edwin turn himself back into a teen. Aaron did, however, notice how happy Edwin looked, showing off everything he did with the Chronivac, and he was surprised at how much Edwin was enjoying his childhood.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Edwin was devastated that he might lose Aaron as a friend.  The kid in Edwin wanted to revert the mental change and have Aaron treat him like a kid again. He was trying hard to fight his childish mindset as his older mindset told him to just change back.  Not knowing what to do, and no longer able to make harder choices due to his diminishing maturity, Edwin’s face turned red and tears started flowing down the boy’s face.<br />
<br />
Realizing that he made Edwin upset, Aaron knew that forcing him to become older again wouldn&#39;t make him happy. However, Aaron was reluctant to make himself younger even though Edwin enjoyed it. Aaron was proud to finally have a driver’s license and turning into a kid would take that away from him. It would also mean he would have to be supervised by an adult and follow their rules, and he would also have to return to Clover elementary. Taking a deep breath, Aaron made his choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you liked being a kid that much, how about I join you?” Aaron offered, which helped Edwin wipe his tears. “You really don’t have to do that man,” Edwin replied, “Why?” “Well, we could actually hang out instead of me babysitting you, and I didn’t want to force you to grow back in case you got used to being younger&quot; Aaron replied. With a huge grin on his face, Edwin pulled up the Chronivac and observed Aarons stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Aaron Wilson<br />
Age: 16 years, 5 months<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Sexuality: Straight<br />
Height: 5’6<br />
Weight: 155 lbs<br />
<br />
Edwin felt a little guilty about taking Aaron’s adolescence away from him, but this gesture meant a lot to him as it would have been hard for Edwin to cope had he turned back tonight with his lack of maturity. After setting Aaron&#39;s age to 10, Edwin turned around to warn his soon to be rejuvenated friend. “Just so you know, once you turn 10 again, everyone except me will think you had always been 10. This also means you’re going back to Clover tomorrow as a 5th grader like me.” “I know man,&quot; Aaron replied, well aware of everything he was about to lose. “You’re gonna have to get used to being a kid for a while because we will only change back when I say we change back. We could also have to grow up again but that’s up to me&quot; Edwin added, which sent shivers down Aaron&#39;s spine. If he didn’t know any better, he would have backed out at that moment and Edwin would no longer be his friend. Then again, Edwin might have made him younger anyway.<br />
<br />
Swallowing his pride, Aaron consented to the change. “This is all for you man,” Aaron replied, “Anything for me to be your friend again.” Being given the honors by his friend, Aaron&#39;s hand trembled as he hit enter. He expected his body to start regressing, his maturity to melt away, and for him to be almost as tall as Edwin. However, nothing happened. “Edwin, what happened?” Aaron asked, “I’m supposed to be turning into a 10-year-old, right?” “Oh, that’s the other thing Aaron. You’re not getting younger right away,” Edwin replied, “I delayed the change so that you can still babysit me tonight. You won’t be 10 until tomorrow morning. It was either that or we both would’ve suffered with Ms. Caldwell.” “Your parents never fired that bitch?” Aaron replied, “I feel terrible for you.” “Yeah, and you’re gonna have to get used to not swearing” Edwin replied. “You’ve been 10 for only a day yet you already know not to swear? It’s like you been a kid for weeks&quot; Aaron stated, puzzled at Edwin&#39;s snark at calling Ms. Caldwell a bitch.  &quot;You&#39;d be surprised how much the way you think can change,&quot; Edwin replied, &quot;Anyway, I have some homework to do and you&#39;re gonna do it with me.  Might as well since you&#39;re gonna be a fifth grader tomorrow.&quot;  Aaron sighed as he and Edwin left the room to start the homework.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the evening, Aaron and Edwin pretended as if nothing had happened, as if Edwin never told Aaron about the Chronivac.  Little did Aaron know, Edwin set a delay to his change so that Aaron would start getting younger as he slept so that he could wake up and be surprised.  When Edwin&#39;s parents returned from their evening, it was time for Aaron to go home.  As Aaron came to say goodbye to Edwin, the boy approached him and whispered, &quot;See ya in school tomorrow.  Hopefully, you end up in my class so I&#39;ll introduce you to my other friends.&quot;  With a shiver down his spine, Aaron turned around and left the house after saying goodbye to Edwin&#39;s parents, oblivious to everything that is happening.<br />
<br />
When Aaron returned to his home, he was already getting tired even though it was only 9 o&#39;clock.  &quot;Damn,&quot; he thought, &quot;This change is happening already.  I feel like I&#39;m gonna pass out.&quot;  He then proceeded to get ready for bed much earlier than he normally would, which made his parents wonder if he was feeling well.  Aaron was in bed and seemingly passed out by 9:30, which was also when Edwin was already in bed given his 9 o&#39;clock bedtime.<br />
<br />
It was just after midnight when the changes really started.  The sideburns that Aaron was proud of vanished almost instantly, and his hair began getting lighter in color and thickness.  His height began to diminish, his shoulders started to narrow, and his head becoming rounder.  His braces disappeared as well, replaced with the crooked teeth that he had throughout childhood.  His toned body was also becoming less mature, and even began to bring back the baby fat.  Before long, Aaron dipped under 5 feet and fat began forming on his legs, arms, torso and face.  His boxers and undershirt changed into flannel pajamas more appropriate for a kid.  His bed was transform from a queen size to a twin size, and the bedspread into a colorful sports-themed bedspread.  His room became more childish, with action figures either on the shelf or on the ground.  Some of his adult teeth started to recede and some of his baby teeth made their return to his mouth, with some of them not being loose yet.  Oblivious to the changes, and unable to wake up, Aaron had successfully transformed into a 10-year-old boy.<br />
<br />
At 7:30 the following morning, Aaron woke up in what he thought was his room.  However, he did not remember it looking that immature; he was puzzled at the covers that were on top of him as well as how much more room he had.  He then stepped out of bed, shocked at the flannel pajamas that he had no memory wearing.  Even worse was the gut that Aaron had suddenly noticed.  Aaron was overweight as a child with his parents pressuring him to lose weight when he was a freshman.  The boy then rushed to the bathroom, and his jaw dropped at the 10-year-old he saw in the mirror.  &quot;For real?  I&#39;m 10 years old?!&quot; Aaron whispered, not wanting to wake his parents, &quot;So that stupid thing worked after all!&quot;  <br />
<br />
The boy then went downstairs for breakfast, which he would normally do for himself, but was now instead done by his mom.  Throughout the meal, both of his parents didn&#39;t notice Aaron&#39;s change.  In fact, Aaron remembered his mom driving him to school on her way to work when he was younger, which stopped when he started middle school.  After breakfast, Aaron dashed upstairs to change out of his pajamas.  He searched throughout his wardrobe to find anything his older self would get away with.  He did have some blank shirts alongside plenty of cartoon print t-shirts, alongside jeans much smaller than what he would normally wear and plenty of briefs.  After picking out his clothes, Aaron was forced to remove his pajamas.  He was then reintroduced to his hairless prepubescent body complete with a somewhat dominant gut.  His teenage mind still intact, Aaron touched his smaller penis, disappointed to find no feeling of arousal of any kind.<br />
<br />
While Aaron was taking stock at his changes, Edwin was getting ready for school.  He had just finished his breakfast and was about to get changed.  He did have a moment to glance at Aaron&#39;s new stats to see if the change had worked.<br />
<br />
Name: Aaron Wilson<br />
Age: 10 years, 5 months<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Sexuality: Straight<br />
Height: 4’7<br />
Weight: 110 lbs<br />
<br />
Edwin snickered at Aaron&#39;s new weight.  Yes, he was now 6 years younger and a foot shorter, but Aaron was once again chubby.  &quot;Wait &#39;till Aaron finds out he&#39;s fat again,&quot; Edwin whispered, &quot;It&#39;s gonna be fun with him around.&quot;  He then grabbed the portable emitter and placed it into his bag, ready for another day of mischief at school with the Chronivac and Aaron, who was once again his friend.  Aaron, on the other hand, was still naked when his mom shouted at him to hurry up.  With the sudden childish urge to obey his mom and avoid punishment, Aaron put his clothes on and dashed outside the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned me into a fat kid?!&quot;  That was the first thing Aaron said to Edwin as soon as their parents dropped them off and left.  &quot;Well, you wanted this, right?&quot; Edwin asked, &quot;Don&#39;t blame me that you were fat as a kid.&quot;  &quot;Well, I thought I was gonna turn into a 10-year-old version of myself, not the way I was when I was really 10!&quot;  Aaron exclaimed, &quot;I mean, look at me dude!&quot;  &quot;Relax Aaron,&quot; Edwin replied, &quot;It&#39;s not like any girl would even care how you look, and I don&#39;t think you should care either.&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re right.  They are rude and gross if you think about it,&quot; Aaron replied, which Edwin strongly agreed with.  &quot;&#39;Rude and gross&#39; What the fuck am I thinking?!&quot; Aaron thought as he and Edwin walked inside the school.  <br />
<br />
To the delight of both boys, not only are they both in Ms. Santos&#39; class, but they are sitting next to each other.  &quot;Just like old times, huh?&quot; Aaron asked.  &quot;Exactly Aaron,&quot; Edwin replied, &quot;And guess what?&quot;  While trying to be subtle, Edwin took out the portable emitter and showed Edwin.  &quot;I was thinking we could mess with possibly the whole school today,&quot; Edwin suggested.  The thought of using the Chronivac to mess up the whole school nearly caused laughter to erupt with the boys, oblivious to their slipping maturity.  &quot;Oh, and see that nerd over there?  The one in velcro shoes?&quot; Edwin asked while whispering, &quot;That&#39;s the Jack Russell I was talking about.&quot;  Aaron was shocked at how Jack Russell appeared compared to last week, when Aaron saw him with Jenna.  Aaron was secretly concerned at Edwin&#39;s behaviour, feeling as if Edwin had tasted power and could easily misuse the Chronivac now that he was immature.  As for Edwin himself, he could remember being 16, but with his immaturity, it wouldn&#39;t be long before Edwin begins believing that he really is 10 years old.</p>
