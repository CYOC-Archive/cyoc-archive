<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Eric wait!” Ben shouted after the new werewolf. Eric tore out of the woods, and to the panicked group near the cars. <br />
<br />
Francis, who had minimal medical training, was looking over Julie’s unmoving body. Martin and Melissa were both beside themselves with worry. Samantha and Martha were off to the side trying to get someone on the phone.  <br />
<br />
“Nate come here, help me get her out of the car.” Francis said. Nate carefully picks up Julie, and set her down on the grass. Eric stopped a few feet away, breathing heavily, his mind frantic and uncomprehending the sight before his eyes.<br />
<br />
The whole point of his becoming a werewolf was so that he could protect the people he cared about most. And now Julie was… <br />
<br />
“Ben, start doing compressions.” Francis shouted to her son (who had CPR training as he was a lifeguard at the lake during the summer). Ben nodded, and was very careful not to knick Julie with his claws as he began to rhythmically pumping her chest. <br />
<br />
Eric stood there, stunned, worried, feeling about a million other things. A siren could be heard approaching the clearing, and the pack didn’t want to get in the way. Samantha and Martha also tried to move Eric out of the way, as the ambulance pulled up. <br />
<br />
Nate and Alex dragged Eric back, though Eric didn’t put up much of a struggle. The same horrible thought kept running through his mind as the others took him away.<br />
<br />
“This is your fault, this is your fault, this is YOUR fault.” <br />
<br />
“Eric, whatever you’re thinking, it’s not true.” his mother whispered, having a hunch as to what was going through her son’s head. While comforting him, she took stock of his werewolf form, comparing it to Nate’s (who was standing directly behind Eric) <br />
<br />
The elder Anderson was a bit more muscular and filled out, even as a werewolf. Eric was leaner, though he still had much larger muscles. Nate’s brown fur was a stark contrast to his brother’s silvery gray. But both had deep amber eyes, and a tawny undercoat. And though Eric’s werewolf form wasn’t related to his late father’s fox form, Eric’s ears and paws appeared as though they were dipped in black. <br />
<br />
“The universe is funny that way I suppose,” Martha thought. <br />
<br />
“Eric…” Nate said, putting a paw on his brother’s shoulder. Eric’s ears laid flat on his head, and his tail was curled close to his body. He wasn’t crying… yet. <br />
<br />
“Eric,” Francis said, coming up from behind him. The Stovalls were en route to the hospital, the ambulance siren filling the night. The remaining members of the pack had dispersed into the forest to give the Andersons some space. Austin lingered at the edge of the clearing. Cassie, unsure of what she should do, stood beside Alex. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to stay Cassie. Go, join the others.” Alex whispered. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t seem right.” she murmured back. Alex nodded. Weres often formed close bonds with those they turned. Not necessarily romantic bonds, but close friendships. Although in Alex’s and Nate’s case it was romantic. <br />
<br />
“This is all my fault.” Eric finally said. Everyone immediately started chiming in with variations of “No it’s not”, “Don’t think like that”, and “You’re not to blame”. <br />
<br />
“Yes it is. Julie’s heart stopped because of me. I may have just as well shot her with a gun. Or stabbed her in the heart.” Eric sobbed. Now tears ran down his face, getting caught in his fur. <br />
<br />
“Eric, Julie’s… condition has nothing to do with you,” Francis began, “she’s in a state of shock, sort of. I think the whole situation was just too overwhelming for her. But YOU have nothing to be ashamed of. Julie’s vision of her ‘perfect life’ was broken, and she couldn’t cope with the reality. Her boyfriend doing something honorable for the sake of his family and friends.” <br />
<br />
“You’re just saying that.” Eric grumbled. <br />
<br />
“No, I’m not. Julie’s done this to herself, so to speak. She’s the one who couldn’t understand your choice. If she wants to heal herself, she’s going to have to accept you the way you are now, and with the choices you’ve made.” <br />
<br />
“I guess. Still, if I’d just waited, maybe I could have talked to her some more.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“Maybe. Or maybe Julie’s mind wouldn’t have been swayed.” Francis said. <br />
<br />
“Your father wouldn’t blame you.” Martha said confidently. <br />
<br />
Her words resonated with Eric, and the tears stopped flowing. He looked up from the ground, and gave a weak smile.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Mom.” he said.<br />
<br />
“My handsome little boy, all grown up.” she whispered, stroking his fur. It was softer than Nate’s, but not as thick. <br />
<br />
“We’ll go to the hospital and see what’s going on with Julie. You go, enjoy the rest of the night. I’ll call Ben if something happens.” Samantha said. Ben nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
Eric was reluctant to comply, as he too wanted to go to the hospital to see Julie. But he knew his presence might complicate matters, and he didn’t want to cause more trouble. He watched his mother and the two Twist women walk back to their respective cars, and drive away. Cassie walked up to Eric’s side, and slipped her paw into his. <br />
<br />
Eric looked down and smiled. He appreciated the female comfort. While he really wanted Julie’s, Cassie’s supportive hand and gaze certainly didn’t make him feel any less comfortable or happy.</p>
