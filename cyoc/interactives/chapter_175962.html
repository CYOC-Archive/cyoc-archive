<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, that went amazingly well, Jay contemplated to himself. Not only did he get to try out this amazing, hot and sensual new form to his solid bod, he got one of the best orgasms in recent memory. He was going to need to remember this going forward. If the feeling he remembered during the sex was any indication, the breast really was something else. But now, Emma wanted to know about the secret behind the magic. She wanted to see the Chronivac for herself.<br />
<br />
Of course she did.<br />
<br />
This was the most phenomenal thing she had likely ever seen. Or would see again. Jay had never heard of magic existing at all himself. Let alone the idea of a magical computer program that could work like a photo editor but actually change the subject involved.<br />
<br />
This made him think about it.<br />
<br />
Exposing more people openly to the fact the Chronivac existed could backfire. He did have a number of political rivals around campus in terms of the student body elections. And some of them would be willing most likely to do something with this kind of magical object to keep him out of the races.<br />
<br />
Then there was the possibility of someone not Jay messing with it and potentially locking him into an irreversible transformation.<br />
<br />
It was Emma right now though, and Jay had some measures in mind thus to keep things from getting too terribly out of control.<br />
<br />
Well, Jay trusted her then. He knew well enough what she was capable of, and she was a risk he could calculate. Jay may have been a hedonistic fratboy after all, but that didn’t mean he had no brain in his skull. He intended one day to be President, after all.<br />
<br />
For one reason, she was one of the few popular girls here without a real mean bone in her body. She was a ditz, hot, and yet one of the nicer girls. Thus he did not see any major reason to suspect her of having any dark hidden motives. She simply lacked that capacity.<br />
<br />
For two, it would open so many avenues of sexual play between the two of them. Setting a transformation to occur over the course of the sexual act and then reverse when it was complete sounded like Jay&#39;s idea of fun. And he knew that Emma was always up for new things. She loved to please him.<br />
<br />
And for three, it would give him someone else in on it who he could count on to initiate transformations. Emma may be rather dull, but she was nothing if not reliable and loyal. Jay had seen that at play numerous times before.<br />
<br />
Thus he showed her directly into his bedroom, heading to the computer and getting it off of the screensaver. The Chronivac was still running, and showed the current state of Jay&#39;s body. 60 / 40 male to female, the exact notes on his statistics... There was even an option on there to scan around the area for subjects. Which got Jay thinking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure, Jay?&quot; Emma asked, cupping her chin and smiling. &quot;This just looks like a photo editing software thingy!&quot;<br />
<br />
She was lucky he found the Buffy and pals style of speech cute. Jay grinned and gestured to it, &quot;This is, believe it or not, exactly where I got my newly slightly feminine figure.&quot; He offhandedly flexed a bicep, enjoying the fact he could change so much about himself just by going on here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...&quot; Emma looked at him, seeming a little troubled by something. &quot;Could you uhh...could you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay smirked a little bit and leaned over. It seemed his girlfriend wanted a proof of what he was capable of doing. He contemplated changing her some to prove it to her, but even as he thought about it, the idea of changing himself some more occurred to him more strongly. For some reason - maybe it was the sheer sensation of it all - Jay wanted to enjoy some further change. Was this the start of some interesting new phase in their bedroom fun?<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I show you first hand what it looks like when I change?&quot;  Jay stated, looking at her with a grin of eager anticipation.<br />
<br />
“That...that would work. But I don’t want it to hurt or anything. Uh, does it hurt at all? When you change?” Emma even seemed concerned for him!<br />
<br />
Jay shook his head immediately, and gestured at it, “No, no...it actually feels really incredibly good to change. When I changed myself and ended up like this, it felt amazing. So don’t be alarmed if you hear me moaning up a storm.”<br />
<br />
Emma just nodded and moved back over to the couch to give Jay his space. She asked, “What are you uh, going to change?”<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna move the gender ratio a bit. Not much. I’m still feeling curious.” Jay said with a smile as he anticipated what this change might end up feeling like. He really was privileged to get to explore this kind of Tiresian entertainment.<br />
<br />
Jay pulled up the gender ratio - remembering the exact points when certain things happened. He certainly didn’t want to lose his dick, not with Emma around here. He contemplated a few different configurations, thinking about what each one might do to him and what effects if any they may have on his body.<br />
<br />
Jay eventually decided on moving to the other side of his current alignment at least for now. 40% male 60% female. Hopefully, he thought to himself, it’d let him keep at least some of his muscles while delighting in how the other half lives so to speak. He didn’t even see however that at 60% there would be more mental effects that would start showing.<br />
<br />
He decided to start the transformation, making it take 5 minutes to complete, while lengthening the duration of the change to 5 hours. He wanted to enjoy himself and see where this all went.<br />
<br />
Emma asked, “How...uh, how much are you changing yourself?”<br />
<br />
“I’m going 60% female 40% male.” Jay said, still confident and enormously self assured even as he started to feel a tingle starting to run through him. Ohh yeah, it was gonna start soon.<br />
<br />
“J-Jay, are you sure? I mean...you get to keep your uh, manly piece, right?” Emma seemed worried about potentially losing out on that. She was flexible, but she wasn’t good with other girls.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, don’t---don’t worry. I only lose that at 90% female. Mm, fuck it feels good…”</p>
