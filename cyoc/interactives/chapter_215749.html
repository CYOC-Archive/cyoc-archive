<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun rose in sky Jeff found himself in his father’s bed having transformed back while in his sleep luckily Jeff’s dad had left for work before he could see his wife turn into his son. As Jeff was just realizing he wasn’t Sophia anymore he found he could still remember everything she did last night, while Sophia still had no memory of being Jeff only that he was her stepson that she didn’t see a lot. At first Jeff was grossed out at the thought of him having sex with his father until he thought of it as Sophia being a different person from himself making it more like witnessing his parents have sex rather him partaking in the act. Although weird having to remember his stepmom’s memories if it made his dad happy he could endure it. And that how things went for the next couple of days Jeff waking up most often in his dad’s room going to school returning home and getting his homework done as soon as possible before Sophia took over, once she did she would do the household tasks for the evening, parent Katie and David who surprisedly took a liking to her and everyday since the cycle began try to have a baby with Mike, after that Sophia goes to sleep whereupon Jeff wakes up again. <br />
<br />
After a couple days of this Jeff started to feel sorry for Sophia as she was trying so hard to have a kid at her age since she married later in life, so Jeff decided to add a modification decreasing her age from 40 to 33 as to ease her stress about conceiving. He also change the time duration of the transformation from 1 hour to 1 minute as he was finding it more troublesome than enjoyable especially since it was just the same change all the time. Once this was done Jeff found Sophia desire to be a mother to have not dimmish in the least if anything the extra youth made her want a child even more. Jeff decided it was best to leave Sophia’s stats for the time being as to avoid any unforeseen circumstances.<br />
<br />
After a few weeks Jeff was seeing a drastic positive change in his family from Sophia, his father wasn’t looking as tired and sad becoming the man Jeff knew in his youth he was getting better at work, which lead to pay increase and less time needed at the office. His siblings seemed more relaxed as after their mother’s death they had to take care of themselves making them miss out on a lot of their young lives but with Sophia taking care of everything at home David and Katie could take more time to improve themselves doing after school activities, studying more and just resting. Once it was proven Sophia’s efforts were making a difference Jeff wondered if he should increase his time as Sophia in the morning so she could make her family breakfast and make lunches for everyone to take to school and work so to ease the struggles of the day freeing more time and energy for everyone. It would mean Sophia would be around longer in a single day than Jeff effectively making him the person Sophia turns into rather than vise versa but Jeff thought that as soon as they didn’t need Sophia he would go back to being himself 24/7. So Jeff made the change Sophia now was going to be around in the morning.<br />
<br />
As soon as Sophia started waking up in the morning rather than turning back into Jeff the Kenwick family found new life unlike they ever had before. Thanks to Sophia cooking everyone’s meals and giving love and confidence in the morning everyone had more energy than they knew what do with. Mike improves at his job even more soon getting a promotion granting him a large regular salary with bonuses, only having to work weekdays and paid vacation time. With his father’s new position David was able to quit a hated part-time job he was doing to help support his family but now was able to pursue his passions. As for Katie she was becoming a more well adjusted young woman thanks to Sophia being a warm confident feminine role model she didn’t have after her mother’s death. Sophia all the while was glad to be providing to her family still trying for her own baby which she thought was coming any day now. The only person not benefiting from this new arrangement was Jeff as he was feeling less connected with his family since with all there extra activities no longer spent time at home when Jeff was round who now just went to class and did homework before turning into Sophia whereupon his family would return to lavish their love for her, on the upside his lunch was the best thing he ever ate. After a month of the initial cycle Jeff thought why not give Sophia his entire weekdays while he kept Saturday and Sunday that way he could avoid the depressing time alone on those days and spend time as himself during a period where it really mattered and maybe Jeff could relive the memories of what Sophia would do during a time where she doesn’t have anyone and anything to care about. So now Jeff would only be around the weekends at the hours of 9am to 6pm a duration less than 24 hours a week.<br />
<br />
After Jeff’s latest time duration edit Sophia’s life really started popping off leaving the house in daylight hours to make new friends, do activities and shop. Sophia started to become very popular in town making friends with other moms, women seeking her sage advice and her neighbors. She joined many clubs and organizations such her children’s PTA, multiple gym programs, HomeEc club and attending her step kids sporting and club events to root them on. She was so busy she had at least one fun activity to do in a day. It was going so well for her she started wondering why of all times she started leaving the house now. She even found time to go a gynecologist to help her conceive. Sophia day would normally go by waking up in early morning where she would freshen up a little before cooking breakfast and lunch for her family which she would spend time with as they prepare for their day, once they left Sophia would finish freshening up then complete the household chores for the day whether that be laundry, vacuuming or grocery shopping, after her busywork is over she would enjoy lunch with one of her friends or more at either their house or her own whereupon after she would do the activity of the day which include club, pilates, swimming, or a special event with more friends, after her activity is over she would return home to spend time with her family by helping with homework, making dinner and helping everyone relax from the rigors of the day, once night falls she and her husband would try to have a baby and at last fall asleep. Another month past like this and Jeff was starting to feel better he had gotten what he wanted more time connecting with his family without the week of depressing alone time and the memories he received from Sophia’s daily routine help make he believe he made the right decision, Sophia more part of the Kenwick family than Jeff every was. Yet this brought an interesting question was Jeff still part of the family or better yet was he still a person the creation that was suppose to help his father has taken a life all on its own and was acting more real than he was but Jeff thought just soon as they can move on Jeff could reclaim some of his lost time. Little did Jeff knew things were about to change forever.<br />
<br />
On the last Friday of the second month of Jeff’s starting this crazy experience something unexpectedly would happen. As the Kenwick family was having dinner Sophia brought up the topic of religion before her mother’s death Jeff’s family were regular church goers but after they haven’t really felt the faith in a long time, now Sophia was suggesting they intend church next Sunday. After a short discussion it was decided they would attend Church every Sunday and that not all Katie had an important Soccer match coming next week Saturday, David had a club event the Saturday after and Mike has a business party on another Saturday of the same month, Sophia agreed to go to all of them. When tomorrow arrived Jeff started panicking as Sophia had just promised away practically all of his remaining time, now Jeff could reclaim some of his week but thought against it as he didn’t want his family to be without her and she had built a life in those days. He could not give Sophia that time but it was Sophia’s idea to go Church and that was a daylong gathering as after prayer the church attendees would normally do volunteer work, Church events and friendly get togethers so Sophia would have to attend that or the others wouldn’t go and he didn’t want to deprive them a place that use to bring them so much joy. As for Saturday David and Katie had asked for Sophia to come not Jeff although they would enjoy their brother’s presence, they needed their mother’s to be there. And Jeff couldn’t really accompany his father to a black tie party where everyone is expecting his wife. So Jeff gave those days to Sophia leaving less than a day a month for Jeff it was then that he realized he was more of a shadow than anything barely hanging around while Sophia held a rich and treasured life that brought joy, happiness and love to those around her. His family will never stop needing Sophia and they will be wanting to spend more time with her will lead to Jeff giving up more time to her. So he decided it was time for Jeff to fully disappear maybe he secretly alway wanted this, maybe Sophia was influencing his actions or perhaps it was a side effect of the Chronivac but the conclusion was clear Sophia was getting rid of a mild nuisance, it would be sad that for Sophia to live she needed to take over Jeff but after this last change Jeff will have never existed. He also added some last minutes edits as well. Wanting to give his family as much happiness as possible he decreased all of their ages by a couple years to give them more time, he still retain their original mother not wanting Sophia to replace her but the next step in their family and finally a gift to Sophia due to the constant transformations she wasn’t able to conceive but now that she was around permanently she could get pregnant and with a single text into the machine Jeff more than insured it to happen by increasing her fertility for the next couple of days and knowing Mike and Sophia they would most definitely have a child. With that all done Jeff set the device to self destruct after this last final transformation as so no one could tamper with his family and then finally hit enter.<br />
<br />
2 years later<br />
<br />
Sophia was enjoying a nice noon day stroll pushing a stroller with a giggling baby girl in it, Julie her pride and joy, as much as she loved her other children David and Katie she must admit Julie holds a special place in her heart soon to be shared by a second as any passerby would see that Sophia was heavily pregnant with her second baby. Her life was a dream she had an amazing husband who praised her everyday whose children treat her like their own birth mother, she held too many friends to count and her days are filled with many joys and events but recently her time has been occupied with her little cutie pie, Julie. All things are as they should be as they alway were.</p>
