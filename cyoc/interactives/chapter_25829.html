<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Shit!&quot; said Gary. His hands, splayed on the floor, now felt numb and inflexible. &quot;Whawt's haawww..?&quot; He couldn't get the words to come out right. Still standing, Scott felt dizzy. His ribs began to hurt and he pressed his hands to his sides, noticing as he did so that his fingers felt oddly stiff.<br />
<br />
Carl groaned as his ribs pressed outwards, barrelling out his chest. &quot;Oof!&quot; he gasped. Like Bobby and Scott, he was finding it hard to stay upright. The pain in their torsos spread to their backs, which cracked and began to elongate. &quot;Aaaaaahaaaawwww!&quot; they cried out in unison. &quot;Heeeeelp!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby started pulling at his T-shirt, but it was stretched tight over his skin -- skin that was now itching like crazy. He and Carl tried to make their way to the exit, but as they did, a tingling sensation spread through their legs. They tried to move them, but they wouldn't respond.<br />
<br />
Escape was impossible anyway. Activated by their braying, a sensor in the ceiling had caused the door to close, and then lock. Following this, another, more powerful mechanism sprang into life. Unbeknown to the lads, the room was a cleverly disguised lift, carrying them down to the basement of the house...<br />
<br />
All four felt another sensation now, deep in their pants. They could feel a rhythmic throbbing gathering pace, building in strength. Their dicks were straining forward, pushing against their jeans -- thrusting, tearing... OUT! Horrified, the guys watched their shafts burst loose -- long, leathery and dripping!!<br />
<br />
Bobby groaned. He could feel the heaviness in his balls as they swelled inside his jeans, pulsing, churning and tightening... 'No!' he thought, as he bent forward over his turgid, bobbing member. 'I'm frickin' dreaming. This can't be...'<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugghh!&quot;<br />
<br />
As their cocks spasmed, spraying jet after jet of spunk, powerful new butt muscles sprang into life, activating control of their new-grown tails. Dismayed, each guy felt his tail rise and flex, beating around in the air behind him before rubbing roughly against the legs of their jeans. 'This can't be real!' Scott thought as he continued to squirt. Then he fell.<br />
<br />
The group were only halfway through their transformation. As their T-shirts split from throat to waist, their hands began to deform, their fingers shrinking to leave one single digit that grew out into a hard, horny hoof. 'My hands!' Carl thought. 'What's happened to my hands?!!' As his own hooves pressed hard against the floor, Gary stamped them in anger. His nose and mouth were starting to tingle and he tried to protest. &quot;Haaaaww, heee haaaw heee haaaaaw!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noisily, their pants burst around their expanding haunches and coarse hide covered their skin. Their eyes rolled frantically as thick brown hairs forced their way out of their ears! Already abnormally long, they now stretched up even more as their bodies contorted, moving back and forth on their heads.<br />
<br />
What was worse, though, was that the lads could feel their mouths moving outwards! Their noses, too, pushed out and flared, their nostrils growing wide over stretching snouts. Their tongues thickened and felt too large for their mouths -- mouths that were filled with huge, yellowing teeth! None of them could see the undersides of their chins, but they felt the soreness as muzzle hairs burst free.<br />
<br />
The four teenagers were now barely human. As their bodies continued to grow and their thighs drew up beneath their bellies, their minds were in turmoil. What remained of their clothing - torn and tattered - fell beside their ruptured trainers.<br />
<br />
Lashing his tail, Scott pleaded to wake up... but was unanswered. Carl and Bobby snorted and stamped. Each could feel his humanity slipping away, but could do nothing to prevent it. The last strong pull on Gary's bones made him yell, but to anyone listening the sound was no more than a donkey's raucous bray.<br />
<br />
A slight judder marked the end of the lift's journey - but the guys didn't notice. With their last human awareness they felt the tingling of thousands of black hairs as they sprang up along their spines and necks. Their manes... Tossing their heads, they saw the wardrobe opposite the bed slide to one side revealing the entrance to a large barn, strewn with straw. Men holding halters waited to greet them... Snorting nervously, the young donkeys tried to make sense of their whereabouts, but coherent thinking was no longer possible. With hesitant steps, they clopped out of the Spook House...into a new life.</p>
