<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the fuck am I going to do?!!&quot; Steven yelled as he walked. His bare feet squirmed on the concrete ground. Every so often a passerby would give him a funny look. He kept his hands in his pockets, holding up the sweats so his penis couldn&#39;t easily be seen through them. &quot;This fucking sucks!!&quot; Steven repeated. He had no idea where these words were coming from but he was really pissed off. So, they just felt like something he needed to say now. He turned around and walked onto a dirt road. It lead directly under a bridge, which gave Steven the best place to hide from watchful eyes. &quot;Fuckin&#39; finally!&quot; Steven shouted as he sat down. He picked up his foot and saw that it was completely covered in dirt and pebbles. &quot;Gross! I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse the dirt or my fucking smelly big feet!!&quot; Steven put it down and started thinking his next plan of action.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck am I gonna do now?!!&quot; he repeated. &quot;I can&#39;t tell my parents. Like even if they believed me, that fucking perv might do something to them! Shit!&quot; The thought of his mom and dad being turned into old people or babies made him angry. &quot;Is there anything I can do?!&quot; Steven was lost in thoughts. &quot;There is someone, but can I convince him? We&#39;re not that close anymore...&quot; Steven then realized there was one person who could help him now; his childhood friend, Thomas. They had known each other for as long as he could remember. Steven knew things about him that no one else did, which would make it easier to get Tom to believe him but he wasn&#39;t too sure that Thomas will remember them. &quot;It&#39;s a risky move, but I don&#39;t fucking have any other choice, do I?&quot; Steven took the one chance he had and texted him. &quot;Hey dude. Don&#39;t be surprised by what I&#39;m going to tell you, but I need to talk to you.&quot; He hit send and waited. After several dozen seconds, he got a text back. &quot;Steven, is this you? Where have you been?! You&#39;re parents are going ballistic!&quot; Steven checked his phone. The time read 6:10. His parents were both definitely home by now. &quot;I can imagine, but I need to talk with you alone. Please go somewhere alone.&quot; He sent another text and waited again. This time the phone rang. Steven took a deep breath and make a call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m alone, but what are you... Who the heck are you?!&quot; &quot;Tom! Tom, wait its me! It&#39;s Steven!&quot; &quot;What the... Hey, who are you and what did you do with my friend?!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m serious here! It&#39;s really me! This scientist guy...!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m calling the cops!&quot; Tom motioned to end the call. &quot;Wait, wait, wait! Listen! When you were five, you told me that you actually loved to eat vegetables.&quot; As soon as he said that, Tom paused. &quot;... And, what? I&#39;ve told that to a lot of people.&quot; After a brief pause Tom asked back. &quot;But not everyone knows that your favorite is broccoli.&quot; &quot;When I was 7, now I like more...&quot; &quot;Brussel sprouts. It&#39;s disgusting, but hey... That&#39;s your tastes, not mine.&quot; &quot;Well, what&#39;s my favorite color?&quot; &quot;Red, like me.&quot; &quot;And where&#39;s my birth mark?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s... let me remember... on your... left... butt-cheek?&quot; Tom paused once again and after what seemed like an eternity, finally asked, &quot;I still have my doubts but... Steven... Is that really you?&quot; &quot;Yes! Oh thank fucking god! Yes!!!&quot; He was successful. &quot;What happened to you? You look like an adult!&quot; Steven then began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow! That sounds amazing!&quot; was the first thing Thomas said after he heard the story. &quot;It wasn&#39;t!! Trust me!! It was fucking horrifying!!&quot; &quot;Wow! You even sound like a grown-up now... So? What are you going to do?&quot; &quot;I need your help. I need some backup until I can figure out how to change me back. And... I need some underwear and socks. That fucking perv scientist didn&#39;t give me any. I&#39;m going fucking commando here!&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll help you, but stop swearing. You sound like a moron.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll be swearing too if you grow a fucking python between your legs that everyone can see because you are not wearing fucking underwear!!&quot; &quot;Ok, ok. Calm down, big boy... And just how am I gonna do that? What do I tell my parents?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t fucking know. Tell them you left some thing at school. It should still be open right?&quot; &quot;I think so, but...&quot; &quot;Look... I know I&#39;m asking a lot, but I&#39;m fucking scared, angry and I don&#39;t wanna be here in the dark! Please, Tom, help me. I beg you!&quot; &quot;Sigh... Okay, I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot; &quot;Oh thank you! Thank you! Also, get me a washcloth. My feet are all dirty.&quot; He lifted his foot up once more. &quot;Ew! Gross! I didn&#39;t need to see that.&quot; &quot;I know, right? And they smell like rotten cheese!&quot; &quot;I didn&#39;t need to know that either!&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven told Tom where he was. It was a place they played at a lot when they&#39;re younger, so he knew Tom could find it. After about a half hour, Steven could see Tom arrive. &quot;Hey Tom! I&#39;m over here!&quot; Tom saw him and rushed over. &quot;Wow! I saw you from the phone, but you&#39;re really ginormous, dude! And that hair on your body! You&#39;re like a sasquatch!!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t fucking remind me... Anyway, did you bring the stuff I asked for?&quot; &quot;I tried but my parents were at their room all the time. So, I bring you some of my dad&#39;s dirty clothes I found in the laundry room.&quot; &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?! I already felt so dirty and sweaty and you bring me dirty clothes?!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s the best I could do... But if you don&#39;t want it...&quot; Tom handed him a towel. &quot;Ok, ok. I&#39;ll take it.&quot; Steven took the towel and dipped the tip of it in the water below, and washed the dirt of his feet and then dried it with the dry end. &quot;No socks?&quot; &quot;Sorry, I bring some of mine but they certainly won&#39;t fit you. I don&#39;t think my dad&#39;s socks would fit you either! Dude! What shoe size are you? 14? 15? Definitely you have the biggest feet I&#39;ve ever seen!!&quot; &quot;Shut your mouth up! Do you fucking think I&#39;d measured them?!&quot; He got up again. His feet would get dirty again, but at least now he can clean them with the towel. &quot;Turn you around. I want to get dressed.&quot; &quot;No way, dude! I need to see this!&quot; &quot;No fucking way! Are you fucking high?!&quot; &quot;Come on, Steven. We&#39;re both guys! You&#39;re almost naked right now. What&#39;s the harm, bro?!&quot; &quot;I... I... Ugh, all right! But I don&#39;t want you say a fucking word!&quot; Steven first took his pants off, his newly grown six inch cock flopped out into the open air and swayed between his thighs for an instant. Thomas&#39; jaw dropped. &quot;Oh.. my... GOD! Is that how a real adult pee-pee look? It&#39;s huge! I didn&#39;t know you can grow hair down there... How it feels?&quot; &quot;Ugh! Don&#39;t stare at it! That&#39;s fucking gross! Do you think this is funny? It&#39;s a fucking salami between my legs!! There&#39;s so much hair that I can&#39;t see my own skin!!&quot; As Steven tried to cover his modesty, it started to straighten out. &quot;You really need to calm down. Hey, what&#39;s happening with your pee-pee? Is it growing more?&quot; Tom asked. &quot;Holy shit! Nlt again!&quot; Steven shouted. Remembering what happened before, he quickly grabbed the pair of dirty briefs and covered it up. However, doing that didn&#39;t calm it down. &quot;Seriously?! I don&#39;t fucking need this right now!! Stupid erections!&quot; &quot;Erection? Is that what that is? Now, your pee-pee really looks like a salami... or a banana.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t need to hear this.&quot; Steven replied as he adjusted his tight briefs to accommodate his hard dick. His pubic hair shown through above, but he tried to hide it by putting on his pants. He then put on the sandals that Tom gave him, they&#39;re pretty small but he can still use them. Lastly he took off his shirt. &quot;Woah!&quot; Tom said. &quot;You really are a sasquatch! Your belly, your chest, those armpits! That&#39;s a lot of hair!&quot; &quot;Do you really think I&#39;m enjoying hearing you said those stupid comments about me?&quot; Steven yelled. &quot;I know it&#39;s gross. I know that I look like a fucking simian! I didn&#39;t choose to be like this! I didn&#39;t want any of this!&quot; After a few seconds, he stopped yelling and finally calmed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to. I understand you must be scared. I know I would be scared if I were in your shoes... These... These are my dad&#39;s gym clothes, so they are a little... revealing. Sorry.&quot; Steven wore a black dropped armhole tank top. &quot;Never mind. I know you did your best...&quot; He never used that kind of clothing, even when he was a hairless boy. So, he felt kinda ashamed that his some of his hairy body was still on display, especially his armpits but he understands that it&#39;s better than nothing  so he sighed and Tom a sly grin. &quot;Now I need to think about where am I gonna go?&quot; &quot;Got you covered!&quot; Tom took out a map and pointed to a spot. &quot;There is my aunt&#39;s apartment. She is traveling to Mexico for a few days. So, you can use it. These are the keys, she gave them to my mom in case of an emergency and this is a big emergency! I will tell your parents you&#39;re going to be in my home for the weekend. So, you have two days to find that scientist and turn back into a kid.&quot; &quot;Wow thanks! You thought about everything! I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry I yelled at you before.&quot; &quot;Never mind. We&#39;re friends and despite the time I still appreciate you. So, just worry about getting your youth back, ok? I don&#39;t want a caveman as a friend for too long!&quot; &quot;You know you&#39;ll also get body hair in a few years, right?&quot; &quot;Blah blah blah. I was joking, dude. Relax a little bit. I need to get back with my parents. So I&#39;ll see you tomorrow at about... mmm... 11 am? Make sure you&#39;re in the apartment by then.&quot; &quot;Got it! And thanks dude! I&#39;d hug you if I didn&#39;t think it would be really awkward!&quot; &quot;Ugh, don&#39;t mention it. Anyway, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, big boy!&quot; Thomas said as he left. &quot;Well then... Let&#39;s find that apartment!&quot; Steven said to himself as he began to walk.</p>
