<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A sense of calm that slowly stole over him, Mathew leaned against the door. He knew that he should go after Tobias, apologise and see if the two could figure a way out of the forest. Instead, he chuckled as he recalled the childhood insult he&#39;d called his brother. Pushing away from the door, he turned and looked at the well furnished living room and thought back to when he and Tobias had been kids.<br />
<br />
Not much had changed, as they had done everything together. And when Tobias had run into trouble, Mathew had been there to protect him. His mind flashing to the biggest issue his brother had had, Mathew reflected back on how, when he was younger, his brother had appeared so androgynous, sometimes it had been difficult to tell if Tobias was a boy or a girl. Moving closer to the couch, thinking of sitting down, Mathew considered how Tobias voice had helped matters, muttering aloud, &quot;Up until he hit puberty and his voice eventually deepened, he actually sounded like a girl. Especially when he got mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still snickering at how, when they had been kids, Tobias gotten so mad when people called him a girl, &quot;Or even treated him like a girl,&quot; Mathew turned away from the couch. His mind on the insult he&#39;d resorted to calling his younger brother, he set about looking for a phone or some hint of who owned the cabin and how long ago they had last been there.<br />
<br />
As he searched the building, he couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it, but there was something off about the cabin. For starters, he discovered it had running hot and cold water, plus electricity, even though he could find nothing that would provide such comforts. Then there was the issue of the rooms, as when he walked around the outside of building, looking for hints of where it was getting its power and water from, then went inside, he found that there was more rooms inside, &quot;Especially bedrooms,&quot; he noted, than it should have been possible for the building to have. Peeking into some of the rooms, he noted a lot of them weren&#39;t decorated too much, but some of them had been decked out as if a woman, a man, a couple, a little boy, or a little girl, lived there. The closest were full of various clothes in all sizes and the pantry and fridge was fully stocked.<br />
<br />
Unsure about all that he was finding, he eventually flopped down on the couch. Laying his head back, he stared at the door. Thinking, &quot;Maybe Tobias was right,&quot; he toyed with the idea of going after his brother.<br />
<br />
Certain if he did, he&#39;d find him sitting some feet away from the cabin, Mathew eventually huffed in agitation. Muttering, &quot;If he wants to act like the way he is, fine. I&#39;m not going to go chasing after him,&quot; he convinced himself his brother was fine. Standing, he glanced at the window and noting it was getting dark, he turned and headed for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
A sense of guilt that gradually washed over him, Mathew found it rather uncomfortable after a bit that he was eating someone else&#39;s food. But, figuring that once he got back to society he&#39;d pay the owner back, he eventually found himself thinking about Tobias again. Looking at the sandwich he&#39;d made, which he&#39;d heaped with fresh cut cooked chicken and mounds of vegetables, the can of soda he was swigging from, and the chips he&#39;d found in one of the cupboards, he wondered if his brother had anything to eat. After a bit of these thoughts, he stated, &quot;Ah, hell,&quot; and pushing away from the table, he stood and marched across the cabin and opened the door.<br />
<br />
Outside the cabin, he stared out into the black night and listened to the sounds of the forest. Curious as to where his brother was, he almost called out for him. Instead, he turned and headed back inside. In the kitchen, he quickly located a plastic container with a lid. Preparing another sandwich, he added some chips, grabbed a pop and locating a pen and piece of paper from a room that was an office, he hastily scrawled, &quot;Dude. Sorry for what I said. If you can forgive, cool. Mathew. PS Don&#39;t know if you found anything to eat, but here&#39;s something,&quot; then affixed it to the lid.<br />
<br />
Back outside, he searched around a bit before he located a fairly open spot that wasn&#39;t to far from the cabin. Leaving the supper he fixed for his brother, Mathew took one last quick glance about before heading back inside, where he sat and finished his dinner.<br />
<br />
Afterward, content and full, he wondered what he should do next. Aimlessly wandering, he eventually found a bathroom on the second floor. Recalling that he&#39;d hadn&#39;t had a shower in about five days, he gazed at the tub and noted that there wasn&#39;t a shower head. Figuring he should probably go look for a different bathroom, he decided against it. Thinking, &quot;Knowing my luck, this cabin has multiple rooms of everything, but only one bathroom,&quot; he began to fill the tub, noting as he did that there appeared to be jets along two of the sides.<br />
<br />
As he plugged the tub and fiddled with the knobs, he gazed absently at the bottles set along one side. Picking one up, he read the description that it was a bubble bath with berry scent that cleaned the skin and opened the pores. Starting to put it back, he swore when it slipped from his hands and cracked against the edge of the tub. A large amount of translucent goop leaking into the tub, Mathew commented, &quot;Shit,&quot; and watching bubbles start to foam, he considered that maybe he should forget taking a bath. But, figuring it wouldn&#39;t hurt and that Tobias wasn&#39;t here to poke fun at him, he soon muttered, &quot;Fuck it,&quot; and stripped.<br />
<br />
Slowly, he lowered himself into the tub, grimacing from the heated water as his body adjusted. Brushing aside some foam, he dunked his head under the water, then laid back. Not wanting to admit as to how relaxed he felt, he gazed up at the ceiling. Muttering, &quot;Bro, you are missing out,&quot; he sighed contentedly and thought how a bubble bath every once a while, &quot;Like, once a year, maybe,&quot; might not be so bad.<br />
<br />
The calm sensation growing, then feeding into other feelings, Mathew absently reached down and began playing with his flaccid penis. Slipping lower in the tub, he sighed pleasantly and as his cock began to stiffen, he shifted to a slow stroking measure. Not able to remember the last time he had beat his meat in the bathtub, he found himself enjoying the randy feeling and wondered why he didn&#39;t do it more often. Closing his eyes, he shifted his legs and promptly kicked the button that turned on the jets.<br />
<br />
Bubbly water shooting out that was soon sucked up, then shot back out in a recirculating system, Mathew snapped his eyes open and thought about turning off the jets. But, finding that the bubbling water, combined with the bubble bath, mixed with the warmth of the water and how sensual he felt, he instead closed his eyes and began working on his penis, which was now rock hard. A series of moans escaping him, he whispered, &quot;Ah. Oh, yes,&quot; and knowing what was going to happen soon, he bucked upward a bit as he climaxed and as he shot a wad of cum under the water, his head slipping under the water a second time.<br />
<br />
Afterward, laying with his head back and staring up at the ceiling, he breathed evenly and began to drowse. Realising he was in danger of falling a sleep, he sat up and shut off the jets. Searching about for a bar of soap and a bottle of shampoo, he soon grimaced when he didn&#39;t find either and that all there seemed to be was, besides the bubble bath, a number of feminine hygiene products that he didn&#39;t know the first thing about. Swearing, he kicked the stopper out and as the water began to drain, he climbed out of the tub.<br />
<br />
Water dripping down his nude body and pooling on the bathmat, he reached for a towel and began to dry himself off. Disliking that he still smelled like the bubble bath, he tossed aside the towel and started to reached for his clothes, but stopped. Looking down, staring at his naked flesh, he uttered, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as he reached a hand up and ran across his chest.<br />
<br />
His torso, now devoid of hair, Mathew began patting it, then, noticing something else, lifted his arms and stared at his hairless pits. Lowering his arms, which also lacked any hair, he glanced back at the bubble bath and wondered if there was something in it that removed hair. Looking down at his now hairless body, noting that even the thick public that covered his penis and testicles was gone, Mathew looked into the tub and was surprised to find that the only thing present was traces of the bubble bath. Certain that there should have been hair still present in the tube, he took one last look at his now hairless body before he started getting dressed, noting as he did that for some reason his skin felt softer.</p>
