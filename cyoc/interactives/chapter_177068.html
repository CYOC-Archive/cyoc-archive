<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a pink, round mass of what looked like jelly. There was no discernable features on its exterior, but a small round object was quickly moving around inside of the pink stuff. That object was no bigger than a golf ball in size and was a darkish gray/brown color. <br />
&quot;Charlotte, Run!&quot; Shouted Hildia, who instantly recognized the creature. However Charlotte hesitated for a second too long. The slime shot out pink tentacle like things from its body and quickly caught Charlotte&#39;s legs before she could react. &quot;Shit! Of all the creatures...&quot; Complained Hildia as she ran over to her daughter. <br />
<br />
Having been grabbed by the slime, Charlotte had fallen down. Hildia moved as quick as she could but the slime was there first, and was already doing its thing. &quot;Mama, help me!&quot; Cried Charlotte as the slime stripped her panties off and began forcing its core inside of her pussy. Hildia reached Charlotte a moment too late as the core had finally entered into Charlotte&#39;s womb. &quot;Ah, it hurts Mama.&quot; Said Charlotte as she could feel a burning sensation comming from inside of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I know. It will. But only for a half a minute. You have to just let it happen. It will all be over soon enough&quot; reassured Hildia, who now was holding her daughter&#39;s hand. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Hildia paused for a moment, but then began to explain. &quot;You are becoming the slime&#39;s new core. More specifically, your womb is. From now on, you and that slime will be inseparable. Literally. There isn&#39;t anything negative to your health besides the initial burning sensation, so there is nothing to worry about in that reguard. You can even still become pregnant and mother a healthy child. And while slimes aren&#39;t necessarily the strongest, they are the most versatile in their usages. Any moment now it should feel better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlotte was doing her best to listen to her Mother&#39;s explination in an attempt to distract herself from the pain. However it was of no use as while she could listen to the information, the pain never lessened until the end. Only 40 seconds had elapsed since the slime first entered inside of her. Just now had finally been the end of the ordeal. Charlotte no longer felt any pain, nor could she really feel anything out of the ordinary. However she now had a pussy that was full to the brim with pink slime goo. The slime was now a part of her. And it would serve her for the rest of her life, feeding entirely off of her body&#39;s waste and expelled fluids. The trade off though, was that Charlotte was now amd forever incontinent. She no longer had any control over her bowels nor bladder, as the slime had taken control over those areas of her body.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it all over, Mama?&quot; Asked Charlotte in a quiet voice as she was picked up by Hildia and carried inside. &quot;Yes sweetheart, its all over now. Just take it easy for a bit.&quot; Hildia set her daughter down on the couch and went to get her some water. Meanwhile, the slime poked itself out of Charlotte&#39;s pussy and began to explore the room using one of its tentacles to feel everything. Charlotte, who had her eyes shut, could feel everything that the slime was doing, as their senses had fully synchronized with each other&#39;s. She could feel the tentacle wrap around a chair leg,  lift a box, rub aling the floor, etc... all the while creating a detailed mental map of the rooms layout. Curiously, Charlotte opened her eyes, and the map in her head suddenly became incredibly detailed as most of the room also filled in as the slime referenced her vision and other senses. She felt a lot more sensitive to things like temperature shifts, and even the subtle changes in air pressure at various spots in the room. <br />
<br />
Hildia walked back into the room, while being extra careful to not step on the slime&#39;s tentacle. The slime immediately moved towards her and began touching her in various spots. Hildia allowed it, as she knew that it was just harmlessly exploring. But the second it went for her cleavage, a small shock passed through its body, causing it to recoil away. Hildia controlled the magic so that only the slime was shocked, however Charlotte still felt it. &quot;Oww.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh... sorry, your senses now are completely linked aren&#39;t they.&quot; Charlotte nods and Hildia stroked her head to comfort her. The slime began to mimic the action and tried to pet Charlotte on her head as well. This caused Hildia to let out a smirk. &quot;Well, at least it seems to like you very much.&quot; She said while trying to lighten the mood. It would have been very troublesome if the slime had decided to rejecte Charlotte after it bonded with her. But this slime was still just a baby. If it had been fully grown, then it likely would be trying to dissolve her at this very moment from the inside. That was why slimes were considered bad familiar, as they rarely ever agreed to coexist with their witch, and only decided that after they bonded. But this slime seemed to love Charlotte, which was ideal. In a few days, Charlotte&#39;s body would be completely immune to the dissolving acids produced by the slime, and instead, would then be able to produce them from anywhere on her body at her will. It is what gave slimes the nickname &quot;a witch&#39;s contraceptive&quot;, as they would disolve any unwanted forign substance within the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Charlotte. I guess congratulations on aquiring your first familiar. Even though it was an awful experience, you did manage to aquire something actually pretty good in the end. It even is of a rare variant too. Now all you have to do is name her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her? Is the slime is a girl? I always thought that they genderless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally they are, but this one has bonded to you. And you are a girl. So it is also now a girl in my book. Don&#39;t worry about that part too much. I just thought it may help you think of a name is all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I pick any name?&quot; Asked Charlotte.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... slimes are not that picky. If it were a dragon or something with a lot of pride, then you may have to think of a better fitting one, but slimes tend to be quite simplistic creatures. Anything will work as a name for them. Even nonsense or made up words are fine, as long as you can remember it. No creature will appreciate you forgetting their name. So dont just invent sonething at random if you can&#39;t be certain that you will remember it, or be able to pronounce it a second time&quot; cautioned Hildia.<br />
<br />
Charlotte nodded &quot;I get it, but is it really, really, ok if I name her anything I can think of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes. Call her Dirt for all I care. She is your familiar. You choose her name. Don&#39;t regret it later as once it is decided it is set for life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mama. I understand&quot; reassured Charlotte with a sudden grin. This worried Hildia, as she now sensed she had just overlooked something. &#39;Wait... what is this girl up to? Why is she grinning like that?&#39; thought Hildia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok slime, I know what your name will be&quot; announced Charlotte. The slime quickly exited her pussy with 80% of her body, leaving only 20% left inside of Charlotte, and sat down on her lap. &quot;Your name will be Pussy, since you now are part of my pussy&quot; grinned Charlotte. The slime seemed to be elated at the name and pulled back inside of Charlotte. Charlotte then recieved one of the most painful shocks to date from Hildia which knocked her to the ground. However that didn&#39;t remove the smile from her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FOR FUCK SAKE!&quot; shouted Hildia.</p>
