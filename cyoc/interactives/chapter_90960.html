<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That evening, Di pulled her blue VW Beetle up to the front of the apartment building where Frieda lived.  Frieda was already waiting for her.  She opened the passenger-side door and hopped in.  <br />
<br />
Frieda was wearing a simple light purple sundress which hung to knee length and flowed beautifully.  The neckline was low enough to show off some mild cleavage, which Frieda had earned through her hormone therapy and was helped along by a good push-up bra.  She also wore 2-inch cream colored pumps with a black stripe which made them look very cute.  Frieda&#39;s make-up was done tastefully with soft eyeshadow and soft pink lipstick.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful, Frieda!&quot; exclaimed Di.<br />
<br />
Frieda blushed.  &quot;Thanks, Di...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, your lessons from Breasty have really been paying off!&quot; Di continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too nice,&quot; Frieda responded softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go see what we can get you!&quot;  And they drove off to the mall.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
A short while later Di and Frieda were exploring a fashionable clothing store in the mall.  Frieda had tried on a few things, and was enjoying herself.  She had picked out a few favorite items, but seemed nervous about something.<br />
<br />
Di caught on to it and asked &quot;What&#39;s the matter, Frieda?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Di... this is a lot of fun and all.  And I really like these clothes... but, um, I&#39;m not really sure how I&#39;m going to pay for it all.  I am kinda broke...&quot;<br />
<br />
Di hadn&#39;t even realized what she was asking of Frieda, and made a quick silent wish.  &quot;I wish that in my purse was a gift card that worked anywhere in this mall and that it had 2500$ on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly the wish came true.  Di smiled at Frieda and said &quot;That&#39;s my surprise for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Di began digging in her purse for the card, Frieda replied &quot;No, Di, I can&#39;t have you pay for me.  I have to be self sufficient, and besides this trip could get very expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Di as she found her prize.  She pulled out the gift card and handed it to Frieda.  &quot;I won this in a contest last time I was here.  It&#39;s 2500$, but it&#39;s only good in this mall.  I already have a big wardrobe and pretty much anything else I could need, but you don&#39;t.  I want you to consider this my gift to you to celebrate your new=found femininity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frieda balked at first, but slowly came around and accepted it.  &quot;Thank you so much, Di!  I can&#39;t believe I have such a good friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You deserve it!&quot; said Di.<br />
<br />
After that they shopped around the store to their hearts&#39; content.  Di decided a fun wish or two while they shopped wouldn&#39;t hurt anything.  &quot;I wish that that male cashier was a cross-dresser.  He only wears women&#39;s clothing, and prefers items from this store.  Nothing else will change about his sexuality, gender identity, or relationships.  He recognizes himself as a man, but just prefers dressing in women&#39;s clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male cashier&#39;s suit changed into a sleek, beautiful dress, and his shoes became shiny black 3-inch pumps.  The new clothes didn&#39;t fit his frame too well, but he appeared very comfortable and moved around with ease.<br />
<br />
Frieda actually commented on him.  &quot;I admire that man for being so comfortable with himself.  I hope one day I&#39;ll be as comfortable with my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will, Frieda,&quot; said Di.  &quot;And by the time we&#39;re through tonight, nobody will ever be able to tell your original gender.  We&#39;re going to make you more feminine than ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frieda giggled.  &quot;Oh, that will be wonderful!&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
After checking out of the clothing store, Di and Frieda walked along through the mall towards their next destination: a lingerie store.<br />
<br />
Frieda had at first objected.  &quot;Di, I&#39;m not sure that would be good for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Di put that to rest quickly.  &quot;Every woman needs a good collection of sexy lingerie, Frieda.  It&#39;s a necessity.  It helps us to feel sexy and helps us on those special nights when we get to please a special someone.  Besides, I know you&#39;ve wanted to try some of these things on for a long time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frieda didn&#39;t resist for long, and agreed with a smile.<br />
<br />
As they walked a couple pairs of anthropomorphs walked nearby.  Both were gay couples, one a lion and a dog, the other a sea otter and a bear.  In the traditional style of anthropomorphs, their genitals were exposed.  They each had large cocks out in the open, swinging as they walked.  Di heard a couple of mall cops commenting from the side of the walkway.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Those animal freaks sicken me,&quot; said one to the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t believe the decency laws don&#39;t apply to them, like they&#39;re so special,&quot; said the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;They should be removed from society and sent to their own island or something,&quot; said the first.<br />
<br />
Di was sick of hearing such intolerance.  She noticed it all the time.  Fortunately, she now had something she could do about it.  She made a couple commands.  Staring at the first, she commanded, &quot;You are completely obsessed with cocks, especially large ones.  The larger the better.  You love to touch them, feel them, suck, them, and have them penetrate you.  You especially love anthro cocks.  A regular passtime for you is to go to anthro-cafes to try and satisfy your craving for large cocks.  You currently have a fling with the bull-morph owner of the china shop in this mall, and visit him regularly on your breaks and off hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di turned to the other &quot;You are now wearing a tiny minidress version of your uniform.  You are also wearing extremely tall 8-inch pointed tippy-toe boots, as well as a chastity belt.  Your footwear is completely impractical, but you have a lot of practice walking in them.  You are a complete submissive to your wife, who enjoys dominating you and making you dress up in slutty female outfits.  You would do anything for her, and she ensures your status as her slave is obvious and constantly makes you do submissive things to remind you of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Di spoke, the changes took place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, did you see the cock on that lion?&quot; asked the first man to the second.  &quot;I would love to get a piece of that!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other one spoke up.  &quot;My wife commanded me to suck off a moose-morph last night.  He was pretty big.  But I couldn&#39;t control myself and came when he penetrated me, so my wife punished me with this chastity belt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moose, eh?&quot; said the first.  &quot;I&#39;ve never tried that, but it sounds fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Di and Frieda walked on into the lingerie store to continue their shopping trip.</p>
