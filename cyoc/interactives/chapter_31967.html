<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once home again and seated in his favorite lounging chair, Guy turns on the television and gets himself all comfortable. As he snuggles into the soft chair, in his shirt pocket sets the vile he just purchased, it gives a shudder then another, and sets to vibrating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I guess its ready!&quot; Guy mumbles to himself, he so wants this stuff to work and make him look and feel masculine.<br />
<br />
Before he could situate himself better, the television warmed up, turned on, and the volume was left so high from watching a video, the sound, its noise made Guy shake as he drew out the vibrating vile from his pocket.<br />
<br />
Startled, he almost dropped the vile, grabbing at it and popping off the small cork that sealed the opened end. He reached with one hand to fumble with the television remote and tone the volume to a more normal level; as he noticed the vile slowing its vibrating and then set very still in his hand.<br />
<br />
Guy eyed the vile, wondering if it was suddenly not any good, or if he should drink it anyway. He grabbed for the phone and tried to call Mr.Yaun, only to hear the busy signal.<br />
<br />
Anxiety over doing something wrong and looking more foolish to his friends, Guy sighs, and tipping the vile high, he pours the expanding green gunk into his mouth.<br />
<br />
The instant the stuff pours in, touching upon flesh and seeking moisture, it seeps into every crack and cranny of his mouth. The sudden surge of saliva boils into his mouth, draining the vile potion down deeper inside him.<br />
<br />
Choking, the green and expanding slurry seeps down his throat but by-passed then the epiglottis gate that blocks what is swallowed from entering the lungs, allowing much of the seething liquid into the lungs.<br />
<br />
Seated and sunken into his favorite chair, Guy coughs, choking on his own spit, he struggles to get up, to stand up, and take deep breaths for coughing.<br />
<br />
The green slurry goes along, seeking moisture and expanding both its volume and widening the effects that caused Guy much more discomfort.<br />
<br />
Falling out of that chair he finds himself on his knees, then becoming quite weak, he hunches over forward, coming to stand on hands and knees, but still choking from the vial contents entering his lungs and stomach.<br />
<br />
Near to passing out, Guy tries to clear his lungs as the stench that comes from out his mouth and nose was rank.<br />
<br />
Guy wished at that moment he had never heard or seen Mr Yaun. He grumbled for his taking the vial and using it, for trusting the old man, as he felt little enough trust for his own father!<br />
<br />
That fat gut grumbled as the then expanding substance worked its way past the stomach, entering down lower, Guy felt hot pains and actually could hear his gut bubbling like some horrid witchery brew.<br />
<br />
Guy felt drained of his strength, weary, he just set there on hands and knees, letting time pass him along to what would come his way.<br />
<br />
Slowly...Guy felt some sense coming back into his head, he had the urge to stand up but felt yet weakened by his experience from swallowing that horrid vile contents of the vial.<br />
<br />
Blurry vision was one other problem he had, his eyes teared as if he were balling his head off over the agony he felt inside him.<br />
<br />
Letting himself slowly gain back his feeling of youth mixed with passion, Guy gulped a deep inhaled breath, arching his back in the process, he then exhaled, as the wind escaping him sounded gruff and almost something bestial of its nature.<br />
<br />
A moment of satisfaction that his aches and pains, coughing and all was finally over, Guy struggled then to stand up. His arms felt odd, muscular and seemingly well able to hoist him up and or he thought they were made to give him added manner of locomotion.<br />
<br />
Such a odd idea about how his arms worked made Guy shake his head in wonder, he could not comprehend why he thought such a thing!<br />
<br />
Returning completely to an upright stance, Guy looked down, awe struck, stunned to see first his clothing scattered about the floor. He let his jaw drop when seeing his gut, the thick coat of black fur covering him like that of some type of dog. <br />
<br />
Guy reached a hand to pet and stroke his thick feeling fur covered belly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly as his hand came into his line of sight, he would of gasped, but instead he bellowed a surprised sounding roar. This too added some sense of surprise, the hand, his hand was then all black, the skin tough and shiny, his fingernails then looked brown and more like claws.<br />
<br />
The thick coating of black fur covered his wrists, up his arms, and with cocking his head to get a better look, Guy discovered the black fur went just about everywhere around and about his body.<br />
<br />
Anxiety began to build, and with his awakening, becoming aware of how he had changed, Guy felt anger, a sense of rage, as he lumbered his bulk form around in a wide circle in the room.<br />
<br />
Walking he had to lumber his feet along on the hardwood floor. The floor itself gave Guy odd ideas, some such that he should venture outside and go climb a tree and give him time to think and ponder.<br />
<br />
Anxiety and fear added to what he felt was a full bladder, and knowing what needed to be done, he lumbered himself out the family room, down the hallway, and walking inside the bathroom, Guy stopped, stunned, horrified, he eyed his reflection in the big mirror above and behind the sink.  <br />
<br />
Wide eyed with a sense of stunned horror, Guy looked at his reflection, one of mass and bulk, he was indeed then hairy, but had changed beyond his wildest nightmares, what looked back at him was a young Gorilla, all muscular, having a Gorilla gut, stout big thighs, hefty muscled legs and looking down he saw his contorted feet, and each with a rotated big toe made to help hold what he might wish to or want to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this cannot be real,&quot; Guy thought to speak, but what boiled out of his mouth came the grunts and roaring sounds of a Gorilla.<br />
<br />
A sudden shiver ran up from his hairy legs, passing his groin, and spreading out, it enveloped his gut, raced along his spine, and rattled his bigger head.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep inhale of air, Guy held it, feeling his body continue to expand, to grow, as if he were maturing into a full grown Gorilla. He felt a tingling down low, his groin felt a building sensation, he wanted for the scent of a female; Guy felt his first true bestial urge to mate.</p>
