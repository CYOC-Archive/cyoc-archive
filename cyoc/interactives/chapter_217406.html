<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared is very happy to have his 12 inches tall friend, Kevin, in his pocket, having fun fooling around with the possibility to change people&#39;s sizes with his  iChronivac app. Sure he wants to do it again, so he listens to what his tiny friend suggests about his friends being tiny too. But even though it was very tempting, he saw another opportunity of experimenting with something different.<br />
<br />
Near Kevin’s friends is also a young boy around 9 or 10 years old. They recognize him, it’s Ian, an adorable playful boy with a huge imagination when he plays with toys of all kinds. He has blond hair and blue eyes and that day he was wearing blue dungarees and a red T-shirt. His parents come from Norway, but their kids are all born and raised here. <br />
<br />
(Kevin) Will you shrink him instead of my friend, Jared?<br />
<br />
(Jared) Nope, I have a better idea, just watch!<br />
<br />
He settle his iChronivac app to increase the size to 12X and aim it toward the boy who was playing in the park near Kevin’s friends. Activating the process, they saw the very confused boy growing, and thankfully, his clothes also grow with him. The boy feels dizzy and had to seats on the grown until he founds back his balance. The now giant Ian can’t believe what he sees, everything and everyone are so tiny. Suddenly everyone begins to run away from that huge kid.<br />
<br />
(Jared) Whoa, that blond boy is sure good-looking, now many people can see it.<br />
<br />
(Kevin) Agreed, he sure has his parent&#39;s good genes, but I wonder what he will do.<br />
<br />
Ian stands up and explores his new tiny environment. He is still confused, but progressively, he becomes amused by all he sees from his new point of view. He spots Kevin’s friends who are running in different directions. It makes him giggle, so he feels like chasing one of them. His attention is focused on Luke, he is one of Kevin&#39;s best friends. That teen boy is around 16 years old, a typical football player who can run when it counts. He’s not bad looking but his success in his sport gave him a monumental ego. Suddenly, he realizes the giant kid is right behind him and closes. So he runs as fast as he could, but it not enough. The boy squats and blocks his way with his hand as he closes around the tiny athlete’s body. <br />
<br />
(Luke) NO KID, let me go, I’m not a toy!<br />
<br />
(Ian) I know you are a tiny guy, and you look like a toy to me now, let’s play!<br />
<br />
From the giant’s perspective, the teen he holds in his fist is around 6 inches tall. He laughs as his tiny toy squirms and begs him to let him go. But suddenly, Ian&#39;s attention goes somewhere else. He sees a convertible sports car passing by. There is a young man driving and a woman is seated beside him. So he puts the tiny teen boy back on his feet on the ground to chase after the car.<br />
<br />
Effortless, the boy picks up the car which has its wheels still turning. The man is in shock and the woman is screaming. That annoys Ian, so not thinking of it very much, he flicks the woman head’s with his finger. It breaks the neck and she dies almost instantaneously. <br />
<br />
(The man)  You killed her, you monster!<br />
<br />
Ian feels bad and it was not on purpose. He realizes tiny toys are fragile. He puts the car back on the street, and the man speeds up to be as far as possible from there.<br />
<br />
Then a very weird man arrives, he walked toward the giant boy. It appears to be Mr. Wilson, a very strange 40’s man who never married but has a very close relationship whit his nephews, maybe a bit too close as the neighbourhood suspects. He is some kind of photographer. But for some reason, he likes to shoot up-view pictures of his nephews, like seen from the floor, looking up at them. Kevin and Jared know about it because, in his last photographic exhibit, the man showed those pics of boys with the sub-theme {My nephews, seen by tiny guys point of view}<br />
<br />
They are surprised to see how he looks as that day, he was not wearing his traditional 3 pieces suit. All he has as clothes are electric blue swimming shorts, he is shirtless and barefoot. He is a tall very muscled man with trimmed body hair. He wears his hair very short, like a Marine. A teen boy, fearless, follows him with a digital video camera. At the giant boy’s feet, Mr. Wilson is waving him up.<br />
<br />
(Mr. Wilson) Hey kid, look at me! Don’t you think I’m a cool muscled to play with?<br />
<br />
Kevin and Jared can’t believe what they see. They are not sure if he does it to keep the boy away from other people if he is crazy and reckless, or he just loves boys so much, he wants something very odd from the giant kid.  The young boy lies on his stomach to have a closer look at that intriguing tiny man.<br />
<br />
(Ian) Hello, it’s nice to see you are not scared of me like the others. Why that teen is firming us? Are you doing a movie or something? <br />
<br />
(Mr. Wilson) Well kind of, actually. I want to show as many as I can how cool giant boys are.<br />
<br />
(Ian) But, but, I’m not a giant, I&#39;ve just grown and I don’t know why. It’s kind of fun though.<br />
<br />
The boy slowly closes his fingers around the tiny hairy muscled man. The teen filmed the man from the front to see the man’s expression as the kid slowly moved his thumb up and down on his body.  The kid was caressing him almost like a pet which seem to please the tiny man. But the boy was not paying attention that his thumb was also rubbing the man’s bulge.<br />
<br />
(Mr. Wilson) Good, I knew you were a gentle boy and I love to be your living toy. You can keep me for a while if you want. Just put me inside your dungarees front pocket, you can also take my young cameraman.<br />
<br />
The boy smiles as he’s seating, legs crossed. He reach down at Mr. Wilson to put him inside his front pocket. Then the teen boy, still filming, sees the giant hand reaching down at him. Nicely he is shoved next to Mr. Wilson in his pocket.<br />
<br />
(Mr. Wilson) So my cameraman, how was it to be in his giant fist?<br />
<br />
The teen tells him that it was a bit scary, but the warmth of his hands and the fact he was careful were not so bad. But he asked the man why he have allowed the giant boy to stroke his body, even his private areas. He just said that the boy has no bad intentions and that he did not want to upset him.<br />
<br />
(Then the giant boy...)</p>
