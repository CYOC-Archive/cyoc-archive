<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Diane, starting to make wild neighing noises, Chad thought it odd that she sounded like a horse, but chalked it up to that maybe these where normal noises she made as he continued to bob up and down. Switching to making a sucking motion, he considered it odd that he found what he was doing was enjoyable, as it felt more and more like he was going down on not a girl, but a guy. He knew he wasn&#39;t a homosexual or anything like that, and had never even looked at a guy in a way that hinted of there possibly being a relationship. Bringing his head back, and pulling Diane&#39;s thickening clit out of his mouth in the process, he peered at it, thinking that if he didn&#39;t know any better, he was staring at an erect penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;d you stop?&quot; Diane abruptly whinnied and fishing for an excuse, Chad pushed on the couch so that he was sitting up and grinning coyly down at Diane, he told, &quot;Because I wanted you to do something for me,&quot; and twisting and shifting, he quickly positioned himself so that the area between his legs was mere inches from Diane&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
His girlfriend, needing no second invitation, especially as she considered that was they were doing greatly lessened the discomfort she was feeling, reached out and grasped him firmly. Her fingers splayed across his thighs, she pushed her face between his legs and began flick her tongue out and in, every so often bringing it across his skin, somethings licking, sometimes probing, tasting and enjoying the warm sticky fluid that covered the area and seemed to emanating from a place she desperately wanted to get at. Knowing it was somewhere, but unsure where, she continued with what she was doing as she unconsciously took one of her hands, cupped it over his penis and testicles and then gently began pressing both flat against his skin.<br />
<br />
A combination of a neigh and a grunt escaping him, unaware that anything was off, Chad found he liked what Diane was doing. Looking down at her genitals, noting that her clit and urethra had not only appeared to have fused to together but also tripled in length and thickness, Chad leaned down. Making another &#39;o&#39; formation with his mouth, he started making a bobbing motion as he idly played with the skin between Diane&#39;s legs, which felt like it was ballooning outward.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Chad lay on the floor, dazed and feeling euphoric. On the couch, her legs spread, Diane peered up at the ceiling, glad that the discomfort in her lower abdomen had gone and the pressure and warmth between her legs and vanished. One arm lazily draped across her belly, the other comfortably pressed against the top of her head, she absently asked, &quot;Was it good? Was I good?&quot; in an offhand manner, still unaware that anything was off as her mind thought that if going down on somebody felt this good, she couldn&#39;t wait to try and have actual penetrating sex.<br />
<br />
From were he lay, a dopey grin on his face, Chad told her, &quot;It was,&quot; and after moment, added, &quot;You were great,&quot; as he played with the idea about what it would feel like to have his beautiful stallion of a lover really take him like a mare as Diane made a contented nickering noise.<br />
<br />
A pressure on his bladder disrupting his thoughts, Chad thought about reaching for his pants. But, deciding it was too much of a hassle, he instead stood, leaned down to kiss Diane and whispered, &quot;I got to hit the head,&quot; before turning away and heading across the living room and out the door.<br />
<br />
From where she lay, Diane had a brief flash that something about her boyfriend didn&#39;t look right. Trying to figure out what, thinking it might have been a trick of the dim light, she sat up and peered in the direction Chad had gone. Glancing over to where her pants and underwear had landed, she announced, &quot;So Bets, Chastity and April are thinking about hanging out tonight. Possibly going to a movie. You want to come with?&quot; as she weighed the chances that, at the moment, she simply didn&#39;t have the stamina to put them back on, yet wondered what Chad&#39;s dad would say if he came home and found her sitting on the couch, naked from the waist down.<br />
<br />
Chad, the pressure on his bladder growing, didn&#39;t answer Diane as he started to hurry. Rushing into the bathroom, he didn&#39;t even bother closing the door as he lifted the lid and seat of the toilet and then reached down to grab his penis to aim it at the bowl. Only, when he did that, his hand brushed against a soft patch of hair and nothing else. Thinking he missed, chuckling and muttering, &quot;Keep missing and you will miss,&quot; he tried again and once more felt his hand brush against nothing but hair and flat skin.<br />
<br />
Alarmed and worried, thinking he was mistaken, Chad took a couple deep, calming breathes and looked down, certain that there had to be reason. &quot;Like maybe after sex, it shrivels up really small, like the what happens when I go swimming in cold water,&quot; he thought as he peered down and finding the light too dim to see anything by.<br />
<br />
A series of curses leaving him, most aimed at the thick curtains his dad had put up over the frosted bathroom window, Chad turned away from the toilet, reached over and flicked on the bathroom light. Glancing down, he nearly began to scream and instead uttered a low moan as he slowly leaned against the toilet, knocking the seat down in the process. Muttering, &quot;No, no, no, it&#39;s not possible, no, no, no, it can&#39;t be,&quot; over and over and over, he stared down at the spot where his penis and testicles were supposed to be and the swath of chestnut hair that covered his groin. Sinking to a sitting position, mind still reeling, a state of shock coming over him, Chad wondered what happened to his genitals and then nearly screamed for a second time when his bladder abruptly let loose and he began peeing.<br />
<br />
Still sitting on the couch, Diane decided that it wouldn&#39;t be proper, rather uncomfortable and all-together embarrassing to be caught by Mr Wilkins, let alone Chad&#39;s mom, naked from the waist down. Reaching over to grab her pants and underwear, she stopped when she felt something thick and warm brush against her thigh. Alarmed, she glanced down and blinked, unable to come to terms with what she was seeing. Certain it was a trick off the light, she giggled nervously, stood and headed over to the living light switch. Feeling its weight as she walked and the way it flopped against her, Diane became and less and less sure that what she&#39;d saw and felt was a trick in any way. Turning on the light and glancing down, she moaned out, &quot;What the fuck,&quot; as she gazed at what she at first thought was some sort of realistic strap-on, then realised it wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Her mind unwilling to accept what she was seeing, Diane squeezed her eyes shut. Telling herself, &quot;You didn&#39;t see that. Girl&#39;s don&#39;t have that. It&#39;s not real,&quot; repeatedly, she began to count to ten.<br />
<br />
After some time, she eventually opened her eyes and peered gloomily down. Certain by what she would see, she nearly started to cry at the sight of the eleven inch flaccid penis, dark in colour, dangling down from the front of her body and nestled in a swath of raven black hair. Hating what she was seeing, she gingerly touched it, disliked the way it felt and revolted by it, she lifted it up, stared at the hole in the tip and the scrotum beneath, which she could see, and feel, had two fair-sized testicles within them. Letting the penis flop back down, Diane muttered, &quot;How is this possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer coming to her, she decided the first thing she needed to do was cover up, as the thought of being discovered to be some freak by either her boyfriend or his parents nearly revolted her as much as the thought that, somehow, she&#39;d grown a penis and set of testicles. Marching across the living room, she scooped up her underwear and pants and started to get dressed, but discovered a new set of problems, as her pants where now way too tight, especially in the thighs and crotch, her new genitals spilled over the edge of her underwear, where too thick to make buttoning her jeans, when she finally was able to get them pulled up, possible and when she tried tucking them between her legs, the penis and testicles either pushed out through one of the leg holes or were too tight and uncomfortable to make it possible for her to pull on her jeans, which fit even worse with the male genitals tucked back.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, Diane eventually flopped back on the couch and glared at the clothes. Thinking she couldn&#39;t go home naked from the waist down, she was distracted from her thoughts when abruptly Chad stated, &quot;I, I, I, don&#39;t know how it happened. You&#39;ve got to help me. It just isn&#39;t right,&quot; from the doorway and gazing in the direction, it took Diane a moment before she realised that if it was disturbing that she had a penis, it was downright eerie to see that her boyfriend didn&#39;t have anything.<br />
<br />
And then, as he stated, &quot;I peed sitting down,&quot; in a hushed, embarrassed voice, it suddenly dawned on Diane what she was looking at, just as her penis began to grow hard and a warm, flushed, aroused feeling washed over her.</p>
