<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
As the mermaid Aquaris moved toward you, your eyes shot toward your wife who was now a mermaid laying on the sandy bottom of the ocean with her eyes half open. A large smile graced her beautiful face, it was almost as wide as the smile that crossed her face a couple of days ago on the night of your wedding. Your eyes shot back toward the mermaid as she reached through the barrier of ocean and air which trapped you in a bubble under the water. You sent your fist flying outwards to hit her as hard as you could, but she caught it and turned it with ease spinning you forward against her as she came through the barrier a bit. <br />
<br />
Your eyes widened in terror, the mermaid didn’t look it but she was much stronger then you were. What you didn’t know was that merpeople as a whole have much stronger and denser muscles so even if he had been a professional weightlifter, he wouldn’t have stood a chance against her strength. <br />
<br />
“Don’t fight, I am sorry I didn’t give you the choice but you will enjoy your new life under the sea.” Said the mermaid as you tried to strike with your other hand however her hand was already at the back of your neck and she pulled you into a kiss.<br />
Your one free hand began to strike out, but the blows seamed to do nothing against her.<br />
<br />
“Don’t fight this.” Said a voice in your head, was it your own voice? <br />
<br />
“This feels so good.” It added as your bows became more spaced out and your eyes grew heavy. Finally they stopped as Aquaris pulled you totally out of the bubble and into the sea. The water felt so good, so welcoming as you floated there, your lips locked on Aquaris’ own as your eyes felt heavy. <br />
<br />
Finally she broke the kiss. <br />
<br />
“Take a breath of the sea, my child.” Said Aquiris as you took a breath, water rushing down your throat and into your lungs. It felt weird but it didn’t hurt, as you took in a breath and exhaled it out. <br />
<br />
You could now breath under water.<br />
<br />
Nearby your wife Velocity or Velo for short had started to wake up more and was sitting up in the water, taking it all in. Maybe she thought she was dreaming or it was part of the transformation process but she wasn’t freaking out as she was breathing in ocean water or that her legs had fused into a single long mermaid tail covered with scales in multiple shades of red with bronze around her hips and at the end of the tail.<br />
<br />
She turned to her husband, Tom to see Queen Aquaris lower him down onto her lap.<br />
<br />
“Leave humanity behind, embrace the ocean.” Prayed Aquaris as she raised your Tom’s lips up to her breast like a mother would for a child and without a moment of hesitation your husband began to suckle on her tit. <br />
<br />
That should have offended you, should have caused blood to run angry hot within you but it didn’t. It was almost a turn on, in truth. <br />
<br />
Your husbands skin became smooth as the hair on his chest disappeared even as his blonde locks he kept styled short turned brighter. You <br />
would miss those chest hairs; you loved running your hands through them as you two made love but the muscles which were coming in would stand in for those. He had always been a fit man, a cross country runner in high school turned long distance hicker and climber he was never lacking in muscles but now those muscles were becoming much more defined. His jaw line became stronger looking as well as a few scars she could see on his body disappeared. <br />
<br />
She had always found her husband hot but now, he looked like he belonged on the cover of a romance novel. <br />
<br />
Then she looked down at where Queen Aquaris had her tale wrapped around Tom’s legs. Velo remembered the pressure on her legs giving away as they where fused together. She turned her gaze away from her husband to her new tail, it was rather beautiful to look at. <br />
<br />
She turned back just in time to see Aquaris begin to unwrap her tail from her husband’s legs. His legs had fused together into a single tail as well. Maybe slightly shorter then her own tail when it came to length but while hers was smooth his had four small fins maybe a couple inches long, two on each side. His tail end was also broader and straight then her own V shape. Around his hips was the classic soft membrane barrier while hers had more pointy scales in bronze while her tail was red. <br />
<br />
The thing that really got her attention was her husband’s dick. That had transformed into just a long animal like shaft which had grown in size compared to his human dick. She blushed a bit as she imagined how much fun it will be to ride that thing, as it slowly slipped back within her husband’s tail. <br />
<br />
At the same moment, his tail started to get covered in blue scales, somewhere neon blue others dark blue to almost black. Around the membrane which separated his human and fish half, it became a soft silver color. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to the sea my child.” Said Aquaris as she lay your husband now merman beside you in the soft sand.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the sea, the 1st couple in the reborn merpeople race.” Said Aquaris</p>
