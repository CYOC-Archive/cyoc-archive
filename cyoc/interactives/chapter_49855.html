<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Four subordinate males to occupy the females the Master doesn't want or doesn't have <br />
time for...&quot; Kaylee looking over a copy of the pack manifest while walking. Truthfully <br />
Kaylee didn't mind that there were a few less females to inch in on her territory and had <br />
wondered if one token male really would have been enough to keep the unwanted and <br />
unworthy occupied but still, &quot;I hope we haven't cut too deep into Master's selection.&quot; <br />
Kaylee said about a man beast who now had twenty equally willing and eager women <br />
total to chose from with no irony or sarcasm in her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's mathematically logical when you stop and think about it.&quot; Darla said, &quot;Marcine did <br />
have the first group of five transformed with a token male, so if she kept that up with <br />
each following group we'd have four males out of a group of twenty. Though I'm <br />
surprised the remaining three aren't as impressive as Nick since it IS their ultimate <br />
singular function.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;Purple Ulysses is just a kid so he has that excuse, but Lawrence <br />
and Roger shouldn't have been so girlie if they turned out male. At least this way though <br />
they won't offend Master's when he checking out the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran suggested, &quot;Maybe Roger and Lawrence started out as girls and drew the short <br />
straws?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee seriously considered that, &quot;That's a possibility, but so far me, and you and Master <br />
all have pretty much been the very much example of our new genders.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla added, &quot;Could have had to do with how none of the new males can surpass Master <br />
like how none of the ladies  surpass you Alpha Female? I noticed none of them were taller <br />
than us.&quot;  Darla wondered, &quot;We had two people named Nicolas and Nicole, I wonder if <br />
Nicolas turned out to be the male of that group, or weather Nicole turned into the male <br />
and gave Nicolas her ribbon.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;Only Marcine knows for sure sister, and by tomorrow mid-morning she'll be <br />
taking that secret with her to her grave. 'Only communicate with other deer once fully <br />
transformed' remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla nodded, &quot;Right, though Nicolas was acted rather ... excited even before his change <br />
rather like Nick is, so the obvious solution is that it is him.&quot; Darla had no desire to <br />
mention how Nicole had managed to knock Darla to the floor twice while Nicole was still <br />
human.  <br />
<br />
Kaylee interrupted the twins, &quot;Or you could, you know, -ask- them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right.&quot; The twins chorused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also,&quot; Kaylee said looking over the list, &quot;Be sure to get a note on which ones have used <br />
their turns to transform the other fifteen staff members. I doubt we'll ever again get as <br />
many turns at our disposable as we have now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; The she-wolves echoed bowing like two sides of a mirror. <br />
<br />
Now that the entire staff would be living on site, and the pack will be dismissing a couple <br />
of the finer things in life like wine and caviar, the shadows were already ordering a vast <br />
quantity of meat to be delivered to the estate along with game and livestock animals <br />
when they were cheaper.  The same effect of the curse that kept the twins and the alphas <br />
before from seeming absolutely impossible before had the same effect on keeping the <br />
delivery men from asking or thinking it worth mentioning a wolf beast thing had picked <br />
up their drop offs. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which it was now about a short bit before lunch time, but waste not, want <br />
not. <br />
<br />
All in all: absorbing Bart and Jenny into the pack as child prodigies, then giving them both <br />
the effective ability to be in four places at once,  and two police officers who'd know what <br />
to avoid and cover up, had been a fantastic lucky break on the part of Jensen, and by <br />
association Kaylee, perhaps even more so than the Smith bank account.  While both Alpha <br />
Big Bad Wolves were proving dangerous cunning and clever, both still only had a senior or <br />
first year high school education! Their first new pack members had a much wider level of <br />
education and experience, and were devoted and loyal to the two Alphas beyond <br />
question.  So Jensen with Kaylee's help acquired the mental resources the pack needed to <br />
continue. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, Jesen had known how to play and manipulate people even before Kyle's <br />
ill thought up Transform had turned her into the Big Bad Wolf (which had increased it <br />
dramatically), and Kyle's perchance for certain games had, if nothing else, given her some <br />
appreciation for resource management. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha female.&quot; The twins asked out of the blue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran asked innocent, &quot;When are you going to take off that helmet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... In a bit...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Miles hoped no one noticed he was late for work. Not only had he overslept, but his <br />
phone service had been down so anyone who had meant to call him hadn't been able to <br />
reach him! Then he got slowed down by heavy traffic! And to top it all off, the bus he had <br />
taken broke down.<br />
<br />
After hoofing it for far far too long, Miles finally found himself at the Smith estate. Of <br />
course everyone would already be inside... but he was surprised not to see any of the <br />
groundkeepers about, had they finished their jobs already and gone home? Miles didn't <br />
claim to be an expert on lawn care so he considered that a possibility. What really caught <br />
Miles off guard was the nasty looking statues now perched on the walls of the estate... <br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze-us! What is with these things? It isn't anywhere even remotely close to Halloween <br />
and these things sure aren't friendly looking!&quot;  They looked like muscular women with <br />
replacement parts of reptile and dog sliced into places... Or where they lady werewolves <br />
with succubi parts added? Miles wished he had paid more attention in art class. As Miles <br />
walked through the front gate, he noticed a similar statue on the waist high wall near the <br />
front door, except this one was decidedly male. &quot;The things people with too much money <br />
will spend it on.&quot; Miles commented to himself. <br />
<br />
As he walked towards the estate, in a semi-steathly manner, he began to hear noise <br />
coming from within the houses' walls. It sounded like a cross between the world's biggest <br />
girls' slumber party and an army of carpenters trying to rebuild the white house in a day. <br />
<br />
He was tempted to go in through the staff foyers, but not wanting to explain how he had <br />
ended up so late to work, and his curiosity getting the better and better of him, Miles <br />
finally chose to walk up to the front door and try to 'sneak' inside to see just what the <br />
giant commotion was all about. <br />
<br />
What he saw left him speechless. Moving about as busy as bees, was a veritable army of <br />
rainbow colored female werewolves carrying torn clothes and antique furniture this way <br />
and that, some with care, some with total disregard. And -why- were they taking the door <br />
frames off?!  Miles was reminded of a twilight zone episode where a married couple <br />
accidently traveled to the future to find a bunch of blue men still building the future piece <br />
by piece. <br />
<br />
He stood looking like a one person audience to the display as a teal colored she wolf -<br />
tore- one door off it's hinges with one arm and was quickly berate by one of her nearby <br />
coworkers for not using a screwdriver, the teal defending they'd be expanding the door <br />
size anyway. <br />
<br />
Feeling a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach Miles began to inch along the walls, some <br />
part of him telling him the very good idea to run and to never look back, but some <br />
perverse sense of curiosity that had somehow survived natural selection inched him on to <br />
try and find out just who these weird werewolf women were and just where were his <br />
friends and coworkers. <br />
<br />
However, a magenta wolf woman with a relatively small bust sniffed the air as she buzz-<br />
sawed away at a now doorless portal being careful not to cut as pipes, power lines or <br />
support beam. She stopped what was she was doing. Sniff the air again. She put down <br />
the tool and took off her safety goggles and she visually scanned for the source of the <br />
scent and spotted it almost at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY MILES!&quot; She waved and shouted from the second floor looking down,  &quot;Hey girls! It's <br />
Miles!&quot; This caused over half the rainbow colored wolf women present to turn their heads <br />
and Miles found all their eyes on him! <br />
<br />
Miles made a mad dash for the kitchen, not even bothering to think how the wolf woman <br />
knew his name. He got a few second's good look at the kitchen (the door already <br />
removed) and saw that the pantry was being heavily reorganized. He never got to set one <br />
foot step inside as the magenta werewolf was suddenly in front of him having moved <br />
faster than his eye could track, it was like a bright colored blur was simply zoomed in <br />
front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Miles, you're late.&quot; The magenta wolf said smiling in a conversation like manner. <br />
<br />
Miles turned to run the other way and bumped right into the bosom of a lavender colored <br />
werewolf. &quot;We were kinda wondering what happened to you but you wouldn't answer your <br />
phone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Miles fell backwards onto his rear and backed up only to hit the magenta one, he <br />
desperately looked around to find he was surrounded on four sides by walls of smiling <br />
brightly colored fur and muscle. <br />
<br />
A pink one to his left chirped, &quot;Don't go acting like a deer in the headlights Miles dear, <br />
that's Marcine and Jack's jobs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Miles saw a tiny tinny space between two of the she wolves and made a mad dash for it. <br />
He never stood a dance. In less than a second Miles was on the floor with rug burn with <br />
the magenta one holding him down on the right, and the lavender one holding him down <br />
on the left. He struggled like a worm on a hook but his body might as well have been in a <br />
vice. <br />
<br />
The pink one faced him and kelt down on her haunches, letting her chest be on level with <br />
Miles face. The fact he was surrounded by several naked women hardly registered in <br />
Miles' mind. &quot;Come on Miles, don't be like this. The Master is simply fixing up the manor <br />
to make it more comfortable for the pack. We'll still have time to loss to me at cards on <br />
Friday I'm sure.&quot; <br />
<br />
Miles blinked as his brain processed this information, then it hit him, &quot;MAX-?! That's you-<br />
?! But how-how-!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me you've all forgotten 'bout me sugah?&quot; Teased playfully the magenta one in <br />
his ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Robin? ... &quot; Miles blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robin with a 'y' now sugah.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha Female explained it all sweetie pie,&quot; The pink one who claimed to be Max said, <br />
&quot;You missed the big ceremony and everything. The Master got a hold of the Game and <br />
realized everyone whose been using it and has used it was thinking way too small and <br />
wanted to do something -big- with it. And what's bigger than the Big Bad Wolves right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The she wolves around him all chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;The-THE GAME?&quot; Miles said, &quot;You mean THE Game? But.. but... but...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a real deconstruction isn't it sugah?&quot; Robyn said coyly. <br />
<br />
That wasn't what Miles was going to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're sorry you missed everything Miles, but better late than never right?&quot; Said the <br />
impossible pink big bad she-wolf. &quot;We'll give you the load down on everything later but <br />
for now we'll just have to give the gist of it we don't wanna have to take too long on you <br />
or Alpha Female will get upset with us, no offense to you Miles.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Miles swallowed. The world had gone stark raving mad. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, Transform or Dare?&quot; The pink wolf beast asked in a perky manner. <br />
<br />
Miles had a very good idea what the Transform was going to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. For your Dare, you'll ask me Transform or Dare and when I answer Dare to Dare <br />
me to ask you Transform or Dare, and answer 'Transform' next time someone asks you <br />
'Transform or Dare.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What....&quot; Miles' face become one of utterly dismay and incredulousness, &quot;THAT'S NOT <br />
FAIR!&quot; <br />
<br />
The anime color pink big bad she-wolf shrugged. &quot;Most things in life aren't sweetie. Now <br />
do it would you kindly?&quot; <br />
<br />
Miles couldn't resist, he didn't want to, he really really didn't want to, but the Game <br />
forced him to say so, forcing the muscles in his mouth and throat to act on their own <br />
accord when he refused to comply. &quot;T-T-Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare!&quot; The pink Wolfen replied instantly with a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I D-Dare you,&quot; Miles put every once of his free will and will power of a lifetime and <br />
everything into it. It wasn't enough. &quot;To ask me Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; The pink wolfen stood at attention and said, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; She said in a <br />
sing song voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot; Miles heard his own mouth say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. But not for much longer.&quot; She leaned in and whispered in his ear. Miles had of <br />
course expected most of it already, and had already kissed his membership card in the Y <br />
chromosome and primate clubs goodbye. It was the rest that shattered more than he <br />
thought he could already be shattered.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall become a Big Bad She-Wolf. Your breasts will not surpass Alpha Female's,&quot; <br />
Miles dementedly wondered what kind of vain, self conscious, petty woman came up with <br />
THAT creed. <br />
<br />
Maxine continued as if she was whispering sweet nothings, &quot;Your color shall be unique <br />
and eye catching. You shall be petit for a Big Bad Wolf but not dwarfish, you shall love full <br />
heartedly Master Jensen, Alpha Male and THE Big Bad Wolf. You shall be unbreakably loyal <br />
and devoted to him and the pack and fully embrace your fate, but won't let it inhibit your <br />
ability to work with the rest of us. You won't use your turn at the Game except to further <br />
the pack's size or goals unless ordered otherwise by our Alphas... no one who isn't part <br />
of or in the service of the Big Bad Wolf pack will remember you existed as who you were <br />
unless you deliberately and intentionally communicate with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The she wolves held him tight even though Maxine had finished. Miles groaned but not <br />
from pain but exertion as his body's muscles expanded and his bones changed shape <br />
and size to accommodate. Fur began to cover his body as his shoes and socks became <br />
the wrong shape for his feet as he desperately worked his digigrated feet free. Claws <br />
grew out from his feet and hands that became wolf paws and articulated paws. His <br />
hearing became wider and sharper as did his sense of smell. The world didn't turn black <br />
and white as he was half-hoping, but he madly then began to pull on his pants and <br />
underwear his tail pushed, -HIS TAIL?!- began to push it's way out. <br />
<br />
That was when he felt the space between his legs becoming an opening, and a new <br />
pressure pushing against his chest. Finally the she wolves all let him go as she began to <br />
pull up her shirt as the press continued to build and her face pushed foreword and felt <br />
with her tongue her teeth all becoming killing tools. But cute killing tools. Miles began to <br />
step up, feeling herself getting taller as her body continued to rearrange itself as the <br />
Game had commanded.  <br />
<br />
 Miles felt what could best be described as butterflies and pixie dust spreading from the <br />
back of his mind foreword. It told him things. Thing that were right. Things that were <br />
right because while they had been told to her they felt really more like her own idea the <br />
more she thought about them, and they felt really -really- good. They made her smile as <br />
she felt the emotions in her chest bubble up and then spread to her entire body. She <br />
helped her pack mates as they helped her take the icky human clothes off that were <br />
hiding her body from the world as if it was something to be ashamed of. Finally she stood <br />
at attention, arms at her sides and feet together looking ahead smiling like the sun the <br />
rest of her pack smiling back checking her out: <br />
<br />
Six feet and five inches and Bright blue eyes, Orange fur as orange as an orange with <br />
snow white secondary fur like Ashley's sky blue fur pattern. And a furry chest that was <br />
one millimeter smaller than Kaylee's. To those who noticed, on her right butt was a tiny <br />
little heart tattoo. <br />
<br />
Maxine asked happily and politely, &quot;Now what is your name cutie?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled answered promptly rechristening herself on the spot, &quot;Millie Persons!&quot; <br />
<br />
Maxine waved her finger teasingly, &quot;No, only Millie, you don't have a surname anymore, <br />
only the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whao kay!&quot; Millie complied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Millie!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; She answered cheerfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Maxine said smiling, then a teasing way asked, &quot;Now whose the dreamiest guy in <br />
the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, Master of course.&quot; Millie said in a slightly lovey-dovey voice with sparkles in her <br />
eyes and flowers in the background. The rest of she-wolves giggled. <br />
<br />
Maxine asked teasingly, &quot;So Millie, what's your chore for getting the house wolf-shape?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I dunno...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's no good at all.&quot; Maxine grinned in a totally non-serious way,  &quot;Now go get <br />
yourself registered and get yourself assigned a job! Alpha Female wants the household <br />
full refurbished and remade for our pack lickity-split! And she's not in the mood for <br />
slackers!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y-yes!&quot; Millie turned around to left as fast her wolf feet would take her, the lavender <br />
she-wolf giving her a tiny playful swat on the rear as she hurried past to give her an <br />
'extra oomph.'  But she stopped at the doorway to the kitchen turned around and raised <br />
an finger meekly and asked, &quot;Uh, where do I register and get my assignment exactly?&quot; <br />
 <br />
Miles' cellphone and wallet were removed and added to the pile and processed like the <br />
rest of the pack's. Miles' torn up clothes shoes and all were carried down to the furnace <br />
and incinerated around the same time her name was written down and her assignment <br />
given. <br />
<br />
And so Millie was assimilated without further fanfare or adu into the she-wolves of the <br />
Big Bad Wolves Pack, becoming just another female in the Big bad Wolf's now impressive <br />
entourage of devoted she-wolves. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Alice had stayed quiet and out of the line sight as the display of Kaylee and the horde of <br />
twenty new Big Bad Wolves, merely observing it and enjoying the silliness of it to a full <br />
degree. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if I should have gone to find some of the rabbits with Bart and Kevin.&quot; Alice <br />
said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, trust me, the flowers are good.&quot; Jenny assured.  'If she chases a white rabbit and <br />
falls down a hole to Wonderland it'll be too much.' Jenny thought.<br />
<br />
 Jenny also felt a wave of pity that Bart hadn't thought to include Alice keeping her sense <br />
of smell, though of course the Transform also insured she wouldn't miss it, or maybe she <br />
meant glass simply had no scent? Jenny let herself pretend that was what Alice meant.    <br />
Of course being limited to the backyard for now they couldn't check on the flowers Kevin <br />
and Marcy had likely destroyed in their game to lure in the groundkeepers. 'But that'll <br />
change soon enough.' Jenny thought, she was sure once the estate had grown wild <br />
enough the pups would be free to roam as they pleased. <br />
<br />
Alice did get a chance to talk the half of the grotesques in the back yard, she'd tell the <br />
front ones what they were to be called when she got the chance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I am Alice.&quot; She mime curtsied at one of the statues. &quot;I am called Mistress. My <br />
name is 'Dear.'  My name is called 'Big Bad.' How do you do? I know you can hear me. And <br />
since you will not answer, I shall pretend you said 'I am doing quite well, thank you for <br />
asking.' And I shall reply, 'That is very good, I am some news for you.' And I shall pretend <br />
that you replied, 'Oh? What news is that Mistress?' And I shall inform you: 'You are <br />
grotesque a guardian of the pack. You are called Southwest. You do not have a name, and <br />
thus your name which you do not have has nothing to be called.' And finally I shall <br />
pretend that you answered 'Thank you for informing me Mistress, good day.' And at last I <br />
shall say, 'And good day to you Southwest.' &quot; Alice mimed curtsied again and walked away <br />
from the female dragon/wolf statue. <br />
<br />
 Marcy and Jenny did nothing but gaze in wonder at this ritual as Alice repeated it twice <br />
more with Southeast and Backdoor but obeying Martha's orders did not dare venture <br />
beyond he backyard. They did not cross paths with their brothers even once. The <br />
backyard was quite big for the wolf pups. <br />
<br />
Jenny due to her new, or perhaps old size felt the backyard was even larger than it had <br />
felt the day before. 'Heh, of course it's gonna be even larger dan dat when da mie <br />
shadows start buying up the land behind the estate.' And they would need it for the game <br />
they would need to hunt as the pack grew. Jenny had no idea about Jensen's gut instinct <br />
that only Kaylee would get pregnant at first. <br />
<br />
Jenny smiled as a thought occurred to her, and smiled more because she knew the same <br />
thought would occur to her shadows. 'If my shadows really do become clearly biologically <br />
female, then even if da sex change operation smoke screen doesn't work: They can point <br />
out dat quite clearly they ARE female as any medical examination would prove, and dat <br />
therefore da records are wrong or in error and count on da emperor's new clothes and <br />
human apathy to take care of the rest. As fer family and friends... well we can fall back on <br />
da sex change thingie then.' <br />
<br />
While Jenny remained fully aware of what sex was and how it was done and fully recalled <br />
doing it herself as an adult, she did her best to think of other things.  Being married to <br />
her own brother up until yesterday gave Jenny shivers.  She showed Marcy and Alice her <br />
back flower garden, which wasn't nearly as damaged as the front ones secretly were.  <br />
<br />
Alice felt the ground with her glass paws and said, &quot;The soil is soft, like most proper <br />
gardens, no wonder the flowers aren't speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Marcy asked with wide eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because they are all sleeping cause the soil is so soft of course.&quot; Alice explained sagely. <br />
<br />
&quot;AH!&quot; Marcy said nodding in understanding. <br />
<br />
The older, black furred, wolf cub present merely looked at the exchanged bewildered. <br />
&quot;Uh, I'm pretty sure flowers don't talk weather they're asleep or not.&quot; <br />
<br />
The seven and a half year old glass cub put her arms behind her back and looked at Jenny <br />
calmly and asked, &quot;Then why do gardeners converse so often with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy meanwhile leaned down to the flowers and asked, &quot;Do you think I look pretty too? <br />
You're flowers so know about pretty right? So do you think I'm pretty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice put a paw on her shoulder and said, &quot;I told you they're asleep, they can't talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; Marcy looked at the slightly older cub. <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually!&quot; Jenny said using her favorite word, &quot;Flowers are asleep when their buds are <br />
closed, and are awake when the buds are open!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Alice said nodding politely, &quot;So they are not asleep. They are simply just lazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... yeah pretty much.&quot; <br />
<br />
On the opposite end of the yard, among a couple of the apple trees, a pudgy white rabbit, <br />
the immediate cat population having been either shot or neutered by some zealot <br />
neighbors, and birds of prey being rare, the rabbit munched on the grass lazily, having <br />
ignored the advice of his many relatives to avoid the eyesight of the humans who lived <br />
here, who in the pudgy white rabbit's personal opinion were all a bunch of wuss' anyway. <br />
<br />
Natural selection took it's course a eye-blink later as the red furred wolf cub came <br />
crashing down on the obese rabbit breaking the rabbit's neck and smashing it's skull <br />
against a tree trunk all in one fluid motion. The rabbit's borrow only thinking 'told him so' <br />
before turning their attention to future generations. <br />
<br />
&quot;How'd I do?&quot; The red furred asked eagerly for his big brother's approval like any little <br />
brother. <br />
<br />
The larger by two years red wolf cub climbed out from his hiding placed, amazed. &quot;Ya <br />
did... pretty good.&quot; Bart answered seeing the now bloody dead rabbit in Kevin's jaws. <br />
<br />
&quot;But... I really didn't get to chase it... it just sorta, sat there while I caught it.&quot; Kevin looked <br />
disappointed. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's just cause yer really fast.&quot; Bart said putting his paw on his little brother's shoulder. <br />
&quot;That's a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we're faster than the rabbits, how are we gonna chase'em?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Bart thought, &quot;Let's give them a little head start next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whao kay!&quot; Kevin nodded at her elder brother. <br />
<br />

In one of the guest rooms, Nicole went down the list she had written up for herself, &quot;So <br />
we remove the doors and door frames, the lumber disposal team will take care of those. <br />
We give the e-bay and auction-house team any furniture that's no good for tails or can't <br />
hold Master's weight. Our major project is to knock down a couple of these walls to <br />
connect these guest rooms into a common den for the majority of the pack. We'll have to <br />
reconnect the power lines and plumbing and of course make sure we leave enough <br />
support beams intact or the ceiling will just come down on top of us -and Alpha Female <br />
will have or heads-. Master, Alpha Female, and Beta Females of course have their own <br />
room. So do the pups, and a couple set aside for their private use too. Hmm... should the <br />
males have their own joint room too or should should they be with the rest of the pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that us sleeping together would be a very nice thing....&quot; Nick said coming up <br />
behind her again, feeling her chest with one hand and feeling between her legs with the <br />
other. <br />
<br />
&quot;OoooOOoooh.&quot; Nicole replied in a slightly sultry voice, &quot;Soorrry, not now Nick, Alpha <br />
Female wants this done for Master and it'll be done for Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on... all work and no play right?&quot; Nick whispered in her ear exploring further. <br />
<br />
&quot;The cubs are to plaaay, we're to work.&quot; Nicole replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this is my job riiight?&quot; Nick whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;And this is mine.&quot; Nicole said lowly clearly enjoying Nick's touch, then her paw wandered <br />
over to one of Nick's hands while the other paw wandered over to his tail and then <br />
twisted it in just the right way. <br />
<br />
&quot;YIP!&quot; Nick let go and started rubbing his own rear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now help me play break out with this wall, but don't damage -anything- understand?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
'In my artistic opinion we have one too many greens.' Thought the twins looking at the <br />
color coordinated furry naked women going about their task with precision and zeal. 'If <br />
ever we get anymore, we'll have to balance them out a little.' However, it was Darla first <br />
who said. In fact, if they got Julie and the girls added to the pack... <br />
<br />
&quot;They're like a well oiled machine. We're going to have this done in the fraction of the <br />
time if we had hired out the same number of workers to get this point.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's what they live for now sister.&quot; Fran nodded. <br />
<br />
Kaylee having -finally- taken the helmet off said, &quot;Speaking of living and the <br />
fundamentals of living...&quot; She snapped her fingers at a plain green she-wolf who nearly <br />
dropped the vase she was carrying as her feet practically instantly glued themselves to <br />
the ground as she turned to face Kaylee. &quot;You, what's your name again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice, Get the pack together and tell everyone it's an hour and a half overdue for <br />
lunch time!&quot; <br />
<br />
Beatrice looked happy to hear that, &quot;Yes Alpha female!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked at the twins, &quot;You two go get the meat out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; The twins bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go inform Master it's lunch time.&quot; Kaylee skipped along. <br />
<br />
Fran looked at Darla, &quot;Sister, You go fetch the meat for the pack's luncheon from the <br />
locker, I'll go inform Martha and the pups in case Beatrice forgets about them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right Sister.&quot; Darla agreed as the two twins, went off in opposite direction, counting the <br />
minutes until they were back together.</p>
