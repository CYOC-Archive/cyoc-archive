<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">// hey, thanks for bouncing off of my story! uh... how do i write author notes? :3<br />
<br />
Confidently striding through the halls of the masquerade, Amure felt hundreds of lustful eyes fall on him. He wasn&#39;t the only giant bodybuilder at the event, of course - he saw plenty of those at the event drawing in their own crowds of attention, some spotting Amure and giving him a quick wink. But something about him did draw in a lot of attention from the attendees.<br />
<br />
Amure pondered for a moment. If anyone could make changes to anyone behind their back, couldn&#39;t someone make changes to him right now without his knowledge? Especially with so many eyes on him… <br />
<br />
Idly rubbing his jockstrap, he bounced his pecs up and down for a goat that has been staring at him for a while who turns away with a blush on his face. Amure loved showing off his body, he was glad there was no dress code at this event. Chesh insisted that he should put on a tuxedo, but Amure got out of it right as they entered the manor. Chesh likes him more when he&#39;s mostly naked, anyway.<br />
<br />
His spine gaining more of a curve as his butt rounded out with fat, he happily raised his tail. He loved teasing men with his butt, too. With a bounce of his hips in his step, he finally spotted Chesh. <br />
<br />
The prince seemed mostly unchanged. He seemed to have gotten slightly fitter, his toned body giving off the impression of a regular swimmer. More jewelry adorned him, with a beautiful, glinting silver necklace drawing in Amure&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
Chesh was sitting behind a table, opposed to the rabbit he was talking with earlier… Haren? Yeah, Haren. The two were playing a card game.<br />
<br />
Haren seemingly went through a few changes of his own. His height climbed up to 6&#39;4&quot;, his large ears big enough to reach Amure&#39;s head. The man was hardly wearing anything, too, showing off his gray-furred body. There wasn&#39;t much to look at, though, the man didn&#39;t have much muscle besides the 6 pack. Sitting comfortably in his boxers, he put down another card.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amure made his way over to the gambling anthros, sneaking behind Chesh. Chesh saw a familiar shadow looming over him, turning his head just in time to be greeted with a facefull of musky pectorals. <br />
<br />
The tiger chuckled, rotating the prince&#39;s blushing head back to the table, crouching down and leaning his head over Chesh&#39;s shoulder. Amure whispered into his ear with a warm voice that made the cat shiver in arousal. &quot;Missed me, my prince? I thought you were going to meet more of your foreign friends, not play strip poker with Haren.&quot;<br />
<br />
The prince, trying to regain some composure to appear regal, said: &quot;I-it&#39;z not like ztrip poker, we were zimply playing a card game… whoever winz, getz to tell a… factual ztatement, about de other…&quot;<br />
<br />
Haren picked up. &quot;And His Royal Majesty has been winning thus far,&quot; he put down another card. &quot;I won the first match, but then it seemed to backfire. It&#39;s a pleasure to see you again, Mister Felinad, you seem to have really gotten into the spirit of festivities,&quot; he looked at the collared mustelid accompanying Amure before bursting out in laughter. &quot;Frankly, I thought it&#39;d be the other way around. The poor marten… You did well, finding such a servant.&quot; Martingue blushed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amure gave a little pat to the marten, who turned into a stuttering mess, and then turned back to the rabbit. &quot;What happened in the first round?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I won, and I truthfully said that His Royal Majesty is a total slut for paws. Whenever anyone brings feetpaws near his face, he can&#39;t help but bury his head in them and begin cleaning them off. Even though, immediately after someone pulls paws away from his face, he begins acting incredibly indignated.&quot; Haren said, happily. Memories flowed into Amure&#39;s head. <br />
<br />
Of course the prince was a pawslut, he knew everything that made the cat tick. &quot;Now, it&#39;s all true, but the problem is… earlier into the night, someone pointed out that rabbit feet bring incredible luck to anyone who rubs them. Except, of course, the rabbits themselves. So I brought my paws near his face, and then he started winning out of nowhere…&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Amure wrapped his hand around the prince&#39;s mouth to silence anything he might say, reaching with another hand towards the prince&#39;s growing erection, rubbing it firmly. &quot;So, if you know he has an unfair advantage, why keep playing?&quot;<br />
<br />
The rabbit chuckled. &quot;Ah, but it&#39;s just too fun… His Royal Majesty first noticed that I am madly infatuated with him, then he pointed out that I&#39;m something of a nudist,&quot; he pointed to his lack of any clothing except underwear, &quot;and now I&#39;ve also been exposed as a master hypnotist, able to put anyone into trance at a snap of my fingers.&quot; He grinned, buck teeth glinting in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. Strange. I thought they&#39;d use those opportunities to make humiliating changes, or, like, try to assert control over us?... It&#39;s almost like they WANT to be dominated,&quot; Amure kissed the prince on the cheek, who moaned lightly as he put down another card. Being a nudist seemed completely natural to the tiger, that wasn’t a punishment, was it? Neither was the hypnotism thing, that was a GIFT. <br />
<br />
The rabbit shrugged. &quot;Such is how they feel today. Usually they do, yes. I remember the Prince gagging Martingue and then saying all sorts of things about your servant over there,&quot; he pointed to the mustelid. &quot;I remember doing some rather humiliating things to Martingue that night… do you mind if we do a repeat of that? My dick hasn&#39;t received any attention the whole night.&quot;</p>
