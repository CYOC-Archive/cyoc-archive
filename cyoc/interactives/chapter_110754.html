<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back tracking to before visiting Brian Walker.<br />
<br />
The strange man who just visited Julie once again. Not to give her a warning, but to physically stop her from doing something foolish. Stopping her from accepting a piece of an old spirit’s essence was not something the dreamers and protectors of Moon Lake where prepared to handle. Taking the gemstone out of the box and crushing it with his hand; destroying the powerful artifact and dispersing its evil back to nothingness; the strange man smiles as he finishes his task. Glad to be back in the domain of dreams, pleasant and otherwise he decides to take a quick stock of those he has been shepherding of late.<br />
<br />
Stopping at the Stovall residence he was surprised to see only Ben and Alex peacefully sleeping in each other’s embrace. Both in their fursonas and dreaming of chasing each other and wild game. The strange man smiles as he shifts the dream; giving Ben and Alex a brief glimpse of their future, welcoming their adoptive child to their cozy bungalow. This causes the two lovers to growl lovingly and hug each other further. Satisfied he allows their pleasant dreams of hunting and chasing to continue unabated.<br />
<br />
Moving to the Anderson house hold; the strange man sees Nate once again sleeping with Jean Talbot. Grinning as the two lovers sleep each dreaming of the other; the strange man chooses to leave the werewolf and were-lioness to their own dreams. Content that the two have found love, yet worried that Nate still has a few bumps along the road with Liv Robinson and a young werewolf who has had her eye on him, Zylina. The strange man moves along to see William and Martha Anderson in bed together; the two bonded were-foxes sleeping after enjoying dinner with Evan and Maggie Lawson. William spooning Martha, each enjoy the other’s furry body rubbing up the other. The strange man chuckles as the two dream of welcoming two new kits to the world. Twin girls each napping on William’s furry chest as he finishes bottle feeding them with Martha snuggling next to him.<br />
“Now that’s a nice dream,” the strange man beams; “but alas it is only that. I cannot tell if you will have twin kits after your sons have grown and started families of their own. But that doesn’t mean you can’t dream of it,” the strange man nodding in approval as he leaves them.<br />
<br />
Travelling to the Hospital; the strange man observes Martin and Melissa Stovall each sleeping. Melissa in the hospital bed, while Martin sleeps next to her on a chair. Both feeling troubled over Julie’s recent actions. The strange man can’t help but feel sorry for the two at what they are forced to go through.<br />
“You both have done what you could to raise Julie right,” the strange man providing comfort as best he can; “yet it is her actions and her actions alone that have put her in the situation she now faces. Do not trouble yourself anymore about her. Think of yourselves and your future son or daughter growing in Melissa’s womb.”<br />
<br />
Satisfied that he has done all he could; the strange man heads on over to where Frances Twist was. Seeing her also asleep in a hospital chair, but next to her mother and with her estranged father no less, took him aback a bit. Sensing there is still much the family needs to do before becoming whole once again; the strange man tries to comfort Frances and Joseph as best he could.<br />
“A father’s love for his daughter is a powerful bond; a bond that takes time to build. You had it at one time, but your stubbornness in letting your daughter be who she wants to be broke that bond Joseph. It’s time to let go of your bigotry, only then will your daughter return to you. And you Frances, you act as if you are Atlas; the titan tasked with holding up the world. Let Samantha and your brother Samson bear some of your burden, it’s no shame to lean on those who see you as their rock.”<br />
<br />
Sighing as he moves on; heading to the Lawson residence and seeing a werewolf deeply hugging his were-panther/feline hybrid wife. Both sleeping happily as they once again coupled; Maggie purring as she feels Evan still in her after he seeded her once more. The strange man grins as he can sense life just beginning to grow in Maggie’s belly.<br />
“I never get tired of that feeling,” The strange man smiling; “you two will make wonderful parents with your future child. Your daughter Spencer I sense will be thrilled at a new sibling and Maggie being pregnant will make a great teaching method for her future foray into motherhood.”<br />
<br />
The strange man observes the sleeping couple a little longer before heading off again. Feeling the pull to check on a few more of his charges; he is surprised to see Anton and Esmeralda Knight sleeping under an oak tree.<br />
“Well,” the strange man smiles; “I haven’t visited you two in a long time. I sense you had a joyous evening with each other.”<br />
Watching the dreams of the two spending time with their granddaughter and the rest of their family together over a Christmas feast of turkey, stuffing, yams and all the usual trimmings; the strange man beams.<br />
“I like the simple dreams the best. So honest and pure, just like your hearts. Rest peacefully Anton and Esmeralda, I can tell that feast you two dream of is one thing that will come to fruition.” The strange man chuckles as he heads towards the knight estate.<br />
<br />
Seeing Benton and Amanda in each other’s arms blissfully asleep and feeling content. Amanda dreaming of her daughter’s birth while Benton dreams of bouncing his future granddaughter on his knee. The strange man sighs as he guides their dreams to memories of Frieda still a baby. Her first words, her first steps, her first family portrait.<br />
“Put your daughter first like you did when she was still a babe,” The strange man smiling; “Be there for Frieda, and she will open up to you more. Then Benton, you can look forward to spoiling your future grand cubs. Same for you Amanda.”<br />
<br />
Seeing the two were-panther parent’s purr and smile as they enjoy the dreams revolving around their daughter; the strange man moves on to visit Eric, Spencer and Frieda. Each snuggled and curled upon each other like a litter of newborn kittens. The strange man takes a slight step back as he is overwhelmed with the intense aura of love emanating from the three. Smiling as he can sense their bond stronger than before. Observing them dream of chasing each other in the woods and chasing wild game while in their fursonas; clearly unashamed at seeing each other’s nudity in and out of their fursona’s. The strange man smiles; not feeling the need to speak and provide them soothing words, he leaves the white furred were-panther Eric to continue his merry chase with Frieda, the grey furred were-panthress  with russet red highlights and Spencer the black furred werewolf/panther/feline hybrid. Content that the trio is capable of comforting each other, he moves on.<br />
<br />
Heading to his next stop; The strange man observes Lance Knight and Lila Carpenter sleeping on the floor of their living room. Not even making it to the bedroom to continue their bonding. The strange man smiles as both dream of a white wedding. Lance at the alter with his brother surprisingly as best man each observing as Lila choosing to walk down the aisle in her were-tigress fursona and wearing nothing but a veil. Her younger brother rick shaking his head in disbelief as his daughter Cindy acting as flower girl tosses rose petals all over the place skipping all the while Jasper and Yogi Rick’s twin boys look on bored wanting to play. Only Ester who surprisingly got along with Amanda Knight looked stoic as her sister in law was about to become Lila Knight.<br />
The strange man decides to leave the two to their own bliss as he heads off; the night nearly over and a new day about to begin; Yet he has one more person to visit. A certain were-otter in need of a bit of guidance.</p>
