<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I didn't want this!&quot; Naomi shouted.<br />
<br />
Yukiko ignored Naomi, her head cocked as if listening to something else. When she stopped, she looked at Naomi and said, &quot;Naomi, I have some important business I have to take care of now. Enjoy your wish! If you need me I'll be back by next Tuesday . . . you know how to call me.&quot; Yukiko vanished in a bright flash.<br />
<br />
Naomi flopped onto her bed again, her new parts pressing against it. She shuddered and curled up into a fetal position, and after moping for awhile over Steve, the stupid wish-granting fairy who'd cursed her with this, and how much her life sucked, she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
When Naomi's alarm went off the next morning, she felt two sensations, one familiar and one unfamiliar: the first a tightness in her bladder, the second a stiffness in her panties. She'd heard that boys sometimes got erections, which they'd taught her about in sex ed, in the morning. Her body's reaction embarrassed her, but she had to pee, so, after checking to make sure the hallway was clear, she dashed into the bathroom and locked the door. She didn't want to look at it, much less touch it, so she gingerly pulled her pajamas and panties down, and sat on the toilet. It took her about a half-second to realize that the stream wasn't going where she expected it to. She clenched her muscles and grabbed some toilet paper to clean up after herself. After she'd done so, she peed again, pushing her penis down with one finger; she couldn't keep herself from grimacing with distaste.<br />
<br />
Luckily, her erection went away, and by smushing it into her panties, she concealed her penis. She got dressed into a pair of jeans she normally only wore on weekends--they were looser and more comfortable--grabbed some cereal for breakfast, and ran out the door into Rachel's waiting car.<br />
<br />
Naomi didn't imagine that school would be that different, but as she chattered with her friends before homeroom, she realized that something was wrong. Naomi noticed how Terri's breasts bowed out the white t-shirt she was wearing, which wasn't so unusual; but Naomi found herself fascinated by the curves they made. She'd look away, start talking, and without meaning to, find herself looking at Terri's shirt again. Embarrassed, she said she had some homework to do, sat down, pulled out her math, and started double-checking it to keep her eyes from wandering.<br />
<br />
In history, Naomi's first class, she sat behind a girl named Katie. Katie liked to wear tight jeans and spaghetti-strap tops; while Naomi had never paid much attention to Katie's apparel before, she found herself spending more time watching the attractive curves of Katie's rear-end and the way her panties crept out from her jeans than listening to her history teacher lecture. As history, so went the rest of the day: she wandered through school in a daze, struggling to keep her eyes off her peers' bodies. At least it keeps me from thinking about Steve. She even passed him in the lunch line and barely noticed, so intent was she on avoiding looking at the girls.<br />
<br />
After leaving school, she immediately ran upstairs to the bathroom: she hadn't dared go all day for fear that someone would see her. Right after, she went to her room, shut the door, and waved the wand. She didn't expect that Yukiko would appear, but she'd nourished a small hope Yuriko's absence now crushed. Naomi laid back on her bed, not wanting the reminder of Yukiko's curse.<br />
<br />
Today's Thursday . . . Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. That's five whole days! There's no way I'm going to survive for that long. Remembering the wording of her wish, she wondered, How do boys survive if they feel like this all the time? It's like I can't control myself, and I've never felt so . . . horny, in my life. Restless and upset, she went downstairs to watch some TV before eating dinner with her parents.<br />
<br />
While Naomi's personal life might be in turmoil, school still demanded her attention. Her parents wouldn't be happy if she let her straight-A average slip. Thus, after dinner, though thinking about The Great Gatsby was the last thing she wanted to do, she plunked herself down in front of her computer and swore she wouldn't move until she'd finished the essay due on Friday.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, she stretched and moaned. Her brain kept thinking about how cute Katie looked in those tight jeans or the attractive curve to Rachel's legs. Despairing, she thought, It's already 10 o'clock and I've barely written one page of a five-page essay. What am I going to do? She needed to do something to make her brain function again.<br />
<br />
She thought of a plan, hesitated as she considered whether it was a good idea and whether she could carry it through, then decided to go for it. She pulled out her cellphone and dialed her older brother Ken's number.<br />
<br />
Ken replied even before she got a chance to say hello. &quot;Hey kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi snapped, annoyed at her brother's mocking reference to being younger, said, &quot;Don't be annoying. I have something to ask, and it's kind of embarrassing. So could you be serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
She could almost see Ken recline back. &quot;Yeah, sure. What's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um . . .&quot; Naomi felt her voice freezing up, but swallowed and forced herself to keep going. &quot;So, um, when you were in high school, did you, um, get distracted by girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Distracted, how? You know I went on dates . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well . . .&quot; Naomi decided she needed to lie. &quot;There's this guy I really like, and I don't think he knows I exist, but that's not the problem. I can't get him out of my head! I'm sitting here trying to work on an essay for English and I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi let the phone go silent for a second, then blurted, &quot;I have the hots for him so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, thinking about him is making you horny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Naomi felt her face burning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what to say, Naomi. I know it sucks to want someone who could care less about you, but I don't know if there's anything I can do to help you. What do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever felt that way about a girl? And what did you do about it? How did you control it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi, you sure you want the answer to that question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken coughed. &quot;Masturbating helps.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an uncomfortable pause. Naomi thought, Why didn't I think of that? But she asked, &quot;It does?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it does. At least if you're a guy . . . I imagine it's the same for girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; Naomi wasn't sure how to conclude the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm already scarred for life by the idea of my kid sister being horny. Let's stop before you say something that makes me want to curl up and die, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Goodbye, talk to you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye kiddo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi looked at the time and sighed. Maybe I should take a bath and . . . follow my brother's advice.<br />
<br />
After running the water and undressing, Naomi settled back in the tub and tried to figure out what she needed to do next. She almost regretted not asking Ken about how boys masturbated, but she doubted her courage would have lasted--it had taken everything she had had just to ask the questions she did. Her problem was that while sex ed had taught her that masturbating wouldn't make her go blind, it hadn't told her much of anything about what masturbation was, or how to do it. She knew it involved touching your private parts, and she'd tried touching herself down there a few times, and it even felt good sometimes. However, she couldn't apply those experiences, because as far as she could tell, all her girl-parts had vanished for boy-parts.<br />
<br />
She knew boys liked to think about girls when having sex, so she imagined Rachel naked. To her horror, her new addition immediately responded. She quickly thought instead about some of the other girls she didn't know so well and discovered that her body didn't seem to be choosy. She'd heard that boys liked to have to their penises rubbed, so she decided to try that first. She soaped up her hand, closed her eyes, wrapped it around her penis, and started rubbing up and down. It felt really good, and as she kept going, it got better and better.<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment to reposition herself, and as she put her hand back, she got a wonderful feeling from running it over the tip. She cracked open one eye and saw that her penis was much bigger now, and that there was a part that had been covered with skin but now protruded. She touched it again and got that same nice feeling, so she kept going, rubbing the sensitive head in circles with her thumb. Involuntarily, she started bucking her hips, splashing water over the edge, and let out a low moan. She burned inside, like she needed to pee, and when she unclenched she felt a hot spike of pleasure lance through her, then another and another. At last, her body stopped thrashing and she opened her eyes, only to see that she'd covered her hand and belly with white goop. Ewww! Yuck! Gross! She knew what it was from sex ed, but that didn't make it any less disgusting.<br />
<br />
She washed herself off, including her hair, which had gotten all sweaty while she'd masturbated. She did feel calmer. Maybe if I do this often enough, I can survive until next Tuesday and I can get that nasty fairy to give me my right body back. Of course, even though she didn't want to admit it to herself, she'd almost be reluctant to lose it: masturbating had felt really good. Of course, she could do it with girl-parts too, and she wondered if it would feel as good. Maybe it's even better.<br />
<br />
She didn't get into bed until midnight, which was a lot later than she'd hoped, but she was exhausted and fell asleep immediately.</p>
