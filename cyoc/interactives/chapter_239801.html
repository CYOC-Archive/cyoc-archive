<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan had just come home from the library, where she had borrowed several books about romance. Being only thirty years old, this was her way of enjoying an evening. Her last read was about a werebull who fell in love with a human woman. The words aroused her when she read their happily ever after. Picking the book out of her bag she was shocked to feel it oddly thinner than when she grabbed it off the shelf for the librarian to scan. Looking at the object in her hand she saw it wasn&#39;t the book she had wanted. The book looked ancient. Its leather looked like it had been mummified and the pages were yellowed with age. Hoping to find the title inside Susan opened it. On the first page was a simple sentence. &quot;think about what you want to know and then turn the page&quot;. Confused at what she thought was a title she turned the page.  <br />
<br />
To her amazement, it had to do with the were-creature myth. It had information about how the werewolf myth started. How people then used that information and made other animal-themed were-creatures and more. Turning the page she was shocked to see her information on the page. It had everything from her shoulder-length chocolate-brown hair to her job as a zookeeper. She needed to know why this book had her info. The next page gave her just that. It explained its story, leaving out its original creator as the woman had erased him.  <br />
<br />
Curious Susan flipped back to the page with her info. It now showed off her bedroom in written form. She tried a simple change: turning her blanket from red to black. An invisible wave of energy leapt from the book in all directions. As it passed over the blanket its color shifted to black. Amazed it worked Susan changed her bed from a twin to a California king with expensive coverings.   <br />
<br />
Amazed at what she discovered she flipped the page. It was once again on the page with the were-creature myths. Smiling Susan wrote, &quot;Every human over puberty will become a were-creature like the one I read in Bull Night&quot;. Eager to see what would happen she leapt out of her bedroom. She put on some jeans just in case and opened her front door. To her disappointment, she didn&#39;t see any were-creatures. Looking up she giggled in embarrassment. The moon was covered. She then decided to walk to the nearby park. Planning to wow the were-beast who came to her heated nether regions she began to run.  <br />
<br />
Once inside the park, she began to stroll. Looking at the sky she could see the full moon was almost uncovered. Susan was ecstatic that her dream would come true. As soon as the moon began to reveal itself from behind the dark clouds she felt it. It felt just like the book described Manny&#39;s transformation. It felt like a warm deep tissue massage. Every muscle across her body began to expand Susan&#39;s clothing began to strain from them. Looking ahead she saw cars outside the park stopping as the occupants left them. Realizing she might have caused some accidents globally she grew red in embarrassment. &#39;eh, I can undo that when I get home&#39; she thought.  <br />
<br />
She then saw a man look down at his crotch in shock, it quickly turned to amazement. His zipper had broken revealing an erect cock hidden only by his straining underwear. He did a double bicep pose as his muscles tore through his clothing. His hoofs effortlessly pushed through his shoes as his horse cock was freed. Above his ass, his new tail became covered in hair as his face pushed into a muzzle. Finally, his short hairstyle became a long wild main, and a goatee appeared on his bottom muzzle as his chest, armpit, and bush all gained thick dark grey fur. The rest of him was a solid grey. Susan could feel her cock twitch at his gorgeous body.  <br />
<br />
Her eyes widened at what she just thought. Looking down she saw a growing cock poking out of her jeans. At first, she couldn&#39;t figure out what was happening, then it hit her. She had accidentally put one instead of ones, at the end, Matilda joined Manny as a were-bovine. However, it seemed like because of her mistake everyone would become like Manny regardless of their original gender. Her shoes broke apart giving way to four toes paws, each tipped with a black claw. She flexed uncontrollably causing her veins to bulge. Across her body tan fur grew, thicker spots of chocolate brown fur made it look like she had leg hair. Her pussy sealed shut as two coconut size testicles caused his new sack to hang to his knees. His cock swelled as it gained barbs, and his twenty-three-inch penis ached with desire. His bush thickned against his creme stomach. His bra became useless as his pectoral muscle pushed out further than his dwindling breasts had ever been. He gained a thick amount of chocolate brown chest fur with tiny patches giving the illusion of him being very hairy. His shoulders widened as his hands gained claws. From his ass a long lion tail grew, it was just over half as long as he was now tall. He gained sideburns as his face pushed into a muzzle. His teeth became fangs and his hair became wild yet sexy looking. Sirius roared as his clothing burst off him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;okay maybe I should&#39;ve been more specific,&quot; he said. He found his voice was deep and oddly sexy, he felt his throat and then moved his hand in front of him. he rushed to a small free books stand near the park&#39;s opening and saw his reflection in the glass. He saw an eight-foot-tall anthro lion with muscular bodybuilders who could only dream off and thick hair-like fur sticking out from the shorter fur. he felt himself getting turned on just by his reflection.  <br />
<br />
Sirius then felt a hand be placed on his shoulder. Turning his head he saw it was the were-horse from earlier. &quot;hello there hot stuff, name&#39;s Silver. What is yours?&quot; his voice felt like a warm cup of hot chocolate on a winter night. &quot;my name is Sirius&quot; he didn&#39;t know why he called himself that but it felt right. The two spoke a bit more before they began to make out. While Susan had never been in any sexual romances before Sirius felt like he knew every way to make Silver cum. he also found himself the dominant one, plunging every inch of his cock into the were-horses ass, and this earned him a whinny from Silver. he didn&#39;t stop until he got every last drop of his cum into his lover&#39;s ass.  <br />
<br />
Little did Sirius know that it wasn&#39;t just the two of them who were feeling romantic. Across the globe, every human above puberty has been affected. It only took a single ray of moonlight to hit them for the transformation to trigger. A fifty-year-old man was showering when a beam peaked through the window. His youth returned to him as he gained fur and claws. Soon a were-bear was cumming in the shower. Elsewhere a single mom was relaxing on the back porch when she suddenly felt the moon touch her. In just a few moments a hairy were-gorilla man was having the time of his life, his cock aching for pleasure.  <br />
<br />
Even mythical creatures were not out of the game. A trucker at a rest stop felt the moon hit him. he gained bat wings and a scorpion tail becoming a were-manticore. Else was a woman trying out her new dress for a gala when she felt herself growing scales and muscles. The were-dragon then flew through the sky with several other flying were-creatures. A mother was helping her daughter in the dining room of their home when the moon&#39;s rays hit both of them. The daughter became a brown were-rabbit with blonde hair and long ears above his head while the mother was a brown and tan were-rabbit with his ears drooping down. The two then made out like they were completely different people. Inside a 24-7 gym a man rushed into the changing room after feeling off. It wasn&#39;t long before he felt himself change. To his glee, he became a classic werewolf. A woman taking out the trash felt herself glowing beneath the moon&#39;s glow. With her new tail and feline cock it was clear another male were-lion was this man&#39;s fate.  <br />
<br />
Within the library, a black and white werewolf man pours over his logs. When he changed under the moonlight he knew someone had to have gotten the dangerous book. He cursed himself for being so foolish. If he hadn&#39;t had that thing open in broad daylight then he wouldn&#39;t have just shoved it away when someone came to check out. Now who knows what else this manic could do? Today is our creature tomorrow who knows? The problem was whoever had the book was just one of a dozen others who passed through his library. He sighed knowing full well that unless the culprit came back here he might be unable to undo their changes. The reality of the universe was literal clay in their hands. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Susan rubbed her head as she got up. She found herself back in her bedroom. She briefly wondered if it had been a dream when she heard a person snore next to her. There sprawled out on the giant mattress was the human version of silver. She tried to recall what caused them to be at her house but couldn&#39;t remember. She realized this was like anything Manny did Mason couldn&#39;t remember, except some things do seep through on occasion. Looking at the book on the nightstand Susan grabbed it and quietly left the room.  <br />
<br />
After grabbing a set of clothes from the hamper Susan turned on the TV and revealed that no one past puberty could remember what had happened besides a few bits. Footage taken from a young boy&#39;s window revealed a were-gorilla in torn clothing before showing a picture of his mother wearing the same clothing. Another showed security footage from a gym on the other side of the country. The video showed every man and woman in it had become young anthro animals.  <br />
<br />
The news even mentioned those not his by moonlight seemed to change just by looking at the were-creatures. That last part confused Susan, except she realized she had fantasized about changing into a were-creature in front of Manny. The book made that part into a reality. She opened the book to reveal what she had changed. As she was about to erase what she had done she remembered how good it felt to be Sirius.  <br />
<br />
Instead, she added and changed some stuff. &#39;those who were dominant last night shall remain male were-creatures during the night. However, those who were submissive during the sexual acts will become female were-beasts at night. If two were-creatures are related to each other they will feel no desire for romance between them, instead, they will act like brothers. All were-creatures will stay in their prime past the age of twenty-three. Any before that will be affected by their age. Were-creatures don&#39;t need to be sexual or romantic all the time. Each were-creature will have a bit of a tell of what they are while in their human form. Finally, each person will find they like their changes and any memories that surface.&#39; as she finished writing she felt herself change slightly.  <br />
<br />
Looking at her nails she saw they were sharper. Using the mirror in her purse she saw her eyes were also like cats. The final piece was her underwear becoming uncomfortable. Going into the bathroom she pulled down her pants and panties revealing a five-inch cock jutting out above her vagina. Taking off her panties she flew commando. &quot;oh, yeah. I&#39;m gonna like this&quot; She smiled as she left, hiding the book under the sink until she needed it.</p>
