<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It&#39;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas,&quot; Jill sang as she went about packing her things.<br />
<br />
She had often found Christmas time to be a very cheerful time, but this December she found the season to be even more joyful. Mostly from the fond memories that had gone on in the bachelor/bachelorette auction at Thanksgiving. She&#39;d known about it and agreed that the money raised to help hurricane victims was for a good cause to go along with it. She had some nervousness that related to her own insecurities, but she went through with it. That related in the choice of Animalian she wanted to be, an American Alligator, as she&#39;d long had an interest in the crocodilian&#39;s ability to hunt and survive, and in its own way even helping other animals during dry years. She also admired its parental care, which was something not seen in other mundane animals.<br />
<br />
However, after her conversion, she&#39;d found a fair share of difficulty. She&#39;d had friends in Lyre and one co-worker that she&#39;d been trying to woo off and on, but while they did accept her as an Animalian, they didn&#39;t want to become Alligators. It had hurt her feelings and was partially why she&#39;d ended up having the therapy sessions with Doctor Jones to help with that. He&#39;d generally found that there wasn&#39;t anything clinically wrong with her, and that she&#39;d needed to work on getting her self confidence back. And some of the others, including old friends, were also very encouraging with that and that was a big help and got her through the bachelor/bachelorette auction.<br />
<br />
And that was what put her in such a good mood as she &quot;got ready&quot; for Christmas. She&#39;d met Beauregard Shucks, a Louisiana Real Estate developer who had made something of a small fortune in the state. He&#39;d come for the auction and spent something close to a small fortune on his bid on her. They&#39;d had a rather nice date and Jill learned a lot about him and found that he&#39;d also had fascination with the American Alligator and was drawn to her for that reason. There was the hope on his part that she&#39;d help with his side project of protecting the American Alligator, at least in the state of Louisiana. It sounded like a nice cause and he was wealthy, but that ultimately wasn&#39;t what really made her happy about Beauregard. He&#39;d also served to be highly interested in her as a person. It showed her that he wasn&#39;t there solely for his own pet projects. <br />
<br />
It made it well worth a second date, which was to go over Christmas. Normally she either enjoyed Christmas at home or drove to her parents place in Utah to spend Christmas with them, but Beauregard had invited her to spend Christmas with him. He included the offer of showing his home and the area he was wishing to protect for the American Alligator as well seeing some of the other sights. With their first date being such a success of the first date, Jill had accepted and was now packing things to get ready.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d already packed various pairs of clothes, including some swim wear, as Louisiana had to be warmer than Nevada. She figured maybe the two of them could go swimming, and while her chest was much bigger as an Animalian than when it was when she was Human, Jill was still a good swimmer and found that her long tail helped that out even more. There was also one other thing she wanted to bring, a box of wrapped nick-knacks that had been made in Animalia. They were statues of Animalians made of wood and were quite decorative. Jill had found them artistically pleasing and figured that they might be something that Beauregard would like, even if things didn&#39;t work out between them. Jill was just about to zip up the bag when she heard her doorbell ring. She quickly zipped things up and moved to answer the door, and found that it was her neighbor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Jill...&quot; her neighbor smiled and noted the packed bag that Jill had brought with her to the door, &quot;You ready? Your flight isn&#39;t too far away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Jill gave a very happy smile and soon stepped out and set her suitcase down on the front step before turning to lock the door behind her, &quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward to this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad your happy,&quot; her neighbor answered.<br />
<br />
Jill nodded. Her earlier frustrations, sadness, and even depression over attracting no attention as an Alligator had been fairly obvious. She hadn&#39;t been outright rejected by her neighbors and many did try to remain friends and keep her spirits up, especially as they saw her often looking a bit dejected at no one wanting to become an Alligator and the fact that the Alligators from the Lyre Zoo were mated to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Jill answered, &quot;Beauregard was a perfect gentleman and was interested in ME. Me, not the fact that I&#39;m an Alligator Animalian... but me as a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s how relationships should go,&quot; her neighbor reminded her, &quot;Love really doesn&#39;t know species...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalia&#39;s Edicts require that though... at least if children comes into play,&quot; Jill nodded, &quot;I would like to lay eggs of my own and cradle my own children... which would require my mate to be a fellow Alligator...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose Mr. Shucks doesn&#39;t want to have children... or doesn&#39;t want to be an Alligator... but does want to be with you,&quot; her neighbor reminded her, &quot;what then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill paused and thought. It was a bit early to really think about marriage and children with Beauregard, but she did like him. Especially the fact that he showed an interest in her as a person and went beyond having interest in her as an Alligator Animalian. That made him worth it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if it comes to that... I suppose, I&#39;d remain vaccinated and we&#39;d simply grow old together,&quot; Jill said slowly, &quot;but for the moment it&#39;s probably a bit early to think that far in advance... But I am hoping he&#39;d be willing to convert and go all the way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her neighbor nodded as the two made their way toward her neighbor&#39;s car, which was parked on the side of the street to give Jill a ride to the airport. She carefully set her suitcase in the trunk and then moved to climb into the backseat and sit in a way that would allow her to sit without being uncomfortable with her tail. The plan was that her neighbor would driver her to the airport and would look after her house while she was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... when do you expect to get back?&quot; her neighbor asked, looking for some clarification on things they&#39;d discussed before.<br />
<br />
&quot;My flight back is on the twenty seventh,&quot; Jill confirmed to her and was pulling her phone out from her purse. Her neighbor nodded while she dialed the number Beauregard gave her. She didn&#39;t have to wait too long before a familiar voice answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Swampland Real Estate, this is Beauregard Shucks, manager and CEO speaking, how may I help you?&quot; came Beauregard&#39;s voice, indicating that he was working at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi... this is Jill,&quot; Jill spoke slowly and couldn&#39;t continue when he responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Jill! The Alligator from Lyre? How have you been? Are you ready for a wonderful Christmas season?&quot; Beauregard asked, his voice also sounding very happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me,&quot; Jill chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m doing quite well and I&#39;m always ready for a Merry Christmas. Animalia has a whole series of events planned... but the thing that I&#39;ve been looking forward to... is meeting with you again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope I can bring you the joy you deserve,&quot; Beauregard answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Jill answered, &quot;anyway, I&#39;m calling to let you know that I&#39;m on my way to the airport. I should be taking off in at least thirty minutes. My flight goes to Baton Rouge. I can call you again once we&#39;re in the air to let you know when I&#39;ll arrive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be looking forward to seeing you again,&quot; Beauregard answered, &quot;I have a few things to finish up... but I&#39;ll be on may way to Baton Rouge to pick you up... Hopefully I can arrive in time... If not, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be there to pick you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it,&quot; Jill answered and then smiled as they said their good byes and she hung up.</p>
