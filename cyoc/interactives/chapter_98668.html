<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam and Evelyn headed over to the lion enclosure. There were not too many lions present right now, most of them being transferred to other zoos for breeding purposes. In fact, there were only two lions present right now. One was a matron lioness named Morowa who has been here for a couple of years and her half-grown cub Leona. The zoo&#39;s been working to find a new male lion to add to their enclosure, lionesses weren&#39;t just as impressive as a big maned king.<br />
<br />
The lionesses looked up as the zookeepers approached. This usually mean it was time for their meal. Adam and Evelyn unlocked the door that led down into the lion enclosure and approached slowly. Leona may have been born at the zoo, but Morowa was originally a wild lion from Africa and it could never be told if she had accepted her captivity or not. Leona bounded over and started rubbing against their legs with enough force to make them stagger. She wasn&#39;t fully grown yet, but she had enough muscle to really push if she wanted to. Morowa, however, was too dignified for such antics, but she did walk over and allowed the zookeepers to pet her, showing she was willing to let them in her territory for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, girls, it&#39;s time for your baths,&quot; said Adam, holding up the bucket full of brushes and towels. Leona gave an annoyed hiss at that while Morowa gave a low growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, you want those coats to be nice and glossy, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked Evelyn, &quot;Besides, you&#39;re starting to smell a bit ripe.&quot; The lionesses didn&#39;t show any signs of acceptance, but they didn&#39;t walk off so that was as good a sign as any. Adam and Evelyn dragged out a pair of big tubs and put quite a bit of hose water in them. The lionesses growled and hissed but eventually they got into the tubs, though not looking entirely happy about it. &quot;Ok, I&#39;ve got Leona, you get Morowa,&quot; said Evelyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;How comes I get Morowa?&quot; asked Adam, looking at the bigger lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;ve got longer arms than I do, you&#39;re more muscular than me, and I called dibs on Leona first,&quot; said Evelyn. Adam gave her an annoyed look as Evelyn dragged Leona&#39;s tub around the corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s lucky she&#39;s cute,&quot; said Adam before turning to Morowa. The lioness was giving him an annoyed look. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get started already,&quot; said Adam before opening up the shampoo bottle and putting a considerable amount of it on his hands. Morowa leaned forward and sniffed his hands with interest. &quot;Oh, you like it? Well, this should make this a bit easier,&quot; said Adam. He started running his hands up and down Morowa&#39;s sides, lathering her up with indigo-tinted suds. Morowa actually seemed to appreciate this and started leaning into Adam. &quot;Easy, girl, you&#39;re the one getting the bath, not me,&quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
But as the scrubbing went on, Adam started to notice something weird. For some reason, Morowa didn&#39;t feel like her usual shape. There were curves and bumps across her torso where there hadn&#39;t been before. Adam started to worry if perhaps Morowa had tumors. He felt a particular noticeable pair of bumps on Morowa&#39;s chest. He carefully felt them over, trying to determine where they ended and began. The more he rubbed, the larger they seemed to be. Then his palms felt two hard points in the middle of those bumps and his fingers closed on them. Morowa let out a positively human-sounding moan at that which made Adam jump back. Now that he was further way from Morowa, he could see that it wasn&#39;t her torso that had changed. Her whole body seemed to be in a completely different shape, one that was starting to look humanoid.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; he asked as he rubbed his forehead. That was he noticed an odd texture on his palm. He looked at his hand and saw the rough pads that had formed on his palm and fingers. He turned it over to see that fur had grown on the back of his hand, and all up his arm in fact. A check of his other arm and legs showed him he had fur there too. What the heck was going on? His eyes darted over to the shampoo bottle he had been using earlier. Could the shampoo have done this? Then that would mean...<br />
<br />
Adam&#39;s ears, which had gotten higher, furrier, and rounder, picked up the sound of splashing not too far away. &quot;Evelyn!&quot; he said in panic before he started running over there. He was about halfway there, when his feet spasm and caused him to trip. He landed roughly on his hands and knees, the impact causing new retractable claws to pop out of his fingertips. His feet swelled before they broke open his shoes. The ruined tatters of his socks and shoes fell away as his foot extended and reshaped so that all his balance was placed upon the balls of his feet, which now resembled lion&#39;s paws. Adam was getting up before with a jolt, his coccyx dramatically extended out of his body and formed a leonine tail.<br />
<br />
Adam got back to his feet, finding it surprisingly easy to walk on his new digitigrade legs. As soon as he got his balance figured out, he quickly headed around the corner to where Evelyn was washing Leona. What he saw made him stop in surprise. Two lion girls were splashing each other and laughing. The one that was in the tub had no clothes on while the one outside the tub was wearing a zookeeper&#39;s uniform, though it had ripped quite a bit on her larger body. Adam&#39;s eyes were drawn to their bodies, from the naked one&#39;s unhidden curves to the clothed one&#39;s tantalizing glimpses. His nose, now much more sensitive, could pick up the scent of the two females.<br />
<br />
The lion girls paused in their splashing when a new scent wafted in their direction. They turned to see a lion man, his body straining against the zookeeper&#39;s uniform that was tearing apart. Evelyn had been so engaged in playing with Leona that she hadn&#39;t thought of who else would be affected by the shampoo. &quot;Adam?&quot; she asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn, what&#39;s happened to us?&quot; asked Adam, trying to keep his mind on their current situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you got started without me,&quot; said a Swahili-accented voice. Adam turned around and gaped. Standing before him was an impressively-built lion woman. She was casually leaning on one arm against the wall, blocking off all exit. Adam wasn&#39;t particularly inclined to leave as he looked up and down the lioness&#39;s anthro form. His shorts were getting painfully tight now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Mom, you look great,&quot; said Leona behind him. Unlike her mother, she had an accent that didn&#39;t sound Swahili, it sounded African-American at most. Adam glanced behind him to see that the two lionesses had come up behind him. The scent of all three lionesses was starting to get to his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have changed for the better as well, my daughter,&quot; said Morowa, &quot;Now you can help me properly welcome our new king.&quot; The anthro lioness reached out and grabbed the front of Adam&#39;s shorts. With one tug, she ripped his shorts open, which had already been badly torn by his change anyways. His underwear had come away as well and now Adam&#39;s dick was exposed in all its glory. It had grown noticeably in size as well as his balls. Like a lion&#39;s penis, it had barbs on it, but they were much softer, more like ridged bumps. The three lionesses breathed in Adam&#39;s musk deeply before they started crowding him even more, each one wanting a piece of him. It was at this point that Adam&#39;s new mating instinct took over and all care faded away as he started fondling the females around him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quite some time later, the new pride was basking in the afterglow of some amazing mating. Adam was in his rightful place at the center. His leonine form was taller and more muscular than his human form, his brown hair had fully grown into an impressive mane. He looked around at the lionesses lying beside him. It was pretty easy to tell who was who. Morowa was the largest and most muscular of the trio, she had a body of sculpted amazonian beauty. She was noticeably older than the others, appearing to be in her early to middle 30&#39;s, but she was still quite sexy. Her daughter, Leona, was the smallest and slimmest. She was not fully grown, being roughly 16 or 17 by human terms. But while her curves may be smaller, they showed plenty of signs of growing bigger if her mother was any indication. Evelyn was the easiest to pick out among the lionesses as she was the only one with human hair. The true lionesses only had their short fur on their head, but Evelyn retained her black tresses. Like Adam, the transformation had made her taller and fitter, but what they really did was enhance her curves. Adam had felt them quite enough to tell that Evelyn had the biggest breasts and ass of the trio.<br />
<br />
The anthro lions had been resting after some rather energetic mating, but now Adam was starting to feel rested. He could definitely go for some more sex, but perhaps it was time for something a little different. The lionesses did defer to him now and he could choose what they did next.</p>
