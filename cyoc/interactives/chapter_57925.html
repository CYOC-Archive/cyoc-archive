<br />
Jensen sat in the chair specially selected for him. Around here were his various business <br />
partners. Given the chaos Kurse had caused by turning the world upside down and then <br />
(mostly) reverted back... there had been predictably chaos in the market place. Stocks had <br />
gone down, many were selling their stock in fear that the end of the world was upon them. <br />
<br />
Everyone more or less that Kurse, the 'spirit' of an old and powerful curse had been the <br />
cause of it all, after all, she had been in the minds of billions of people around the world at <br />
once who caught a glimpse of her vision of a world born of total chaos. <br />
<br />
Some mild lunatics had found the image of that world beautiful and were now causing <br />
short term, and not so short term havoc and property damage, while others were forming <br />
cults, and some simply became anarchists even if most anarchists screamed their world <br />
without laws wouldn't actually be chaos (somehow). Some broke down into despair and a <br />
wonder if they'd ever emerge from it.<br />
<br />
 The majority treated it like a near death experience and actually turned to their respective <br />
religions for help, guidance and protection. Thank God in Heaven that not a single one had <br />
begun to play the 'blame game' with one person blaming some other faction for causing <br />
the curse or bringing it down: Kurse had been crystal clear in everyone's mind that she <br />
loathed all religions and governments and businesses. <br />
<br />
Naturally most atheists chose to politely keep their opinions to themselves until the hot <br />
dust had settled. <br />
<br />
The Big Bad Wolf Pack's holders were actually quite bigger than those of the Smith family in <br />
the previous reality. This made them much bigger players to boot and drawing their <br />
attention.  <br />
<br />
One person at the large table at the meeting room permanently rented out to the Big Bad <br />
Wolf Pack and it's associates was another Lupman. A semi-large male at eight feet tall, his <br />
fur was the color of blood and his eyes  deep almost black brown. He wasn't part of <br />
Jensen's pack and was from Frostvile.<br />
<br />
A nine foot tall female leoman, and an ten foot and one incch tall male leoman also sat at <br />
the table having come all the way from New York. No one knew of course that earlier that <br />
morning they had been human beings, his wife taking great pride in her long red hair that <br />
had now not ever existed and though wigs were weird. <br />
<br />
Another was a sand colored scales female dragon. She was incredibly old, and it was a joke <br />
she only kept going through sheer will power. Unlike Mr. P and Mother Glen, her age <br />
showed, with cracks in her natural armor and missing scales. Her blue scaled grandson <br />
stood three steps behind her to cater to her every need.  She only had one wing. A japanese <br />
Zero had blown it off in world war two. She had spent a decade in emotional rehab. She <br />
wore a custom military uniform, with of course, a purple heart medal. Her tail impatiently <br />
flicked behind her. <br />
<br />
There were also four middle aged humans, three men and one woman, the one woman <br />
wearing sun glasses she never took off, and she made a point of always carrying a pistol <br />
when coming to Glendale and wearing earphones when walking outside. Normally she did <br />
all her business via conference calls, not daring to set foot in this cursed city. But sadly the <br />
bylaws here required her to be there in person. <br />
<br />
Finally a small felman (even by felman standards) sat in the last chair, his bright red and <br />
blue fur had nearly all turned gray. An miniature imitation image of a gargoyle topped his <br />
cane. <br />
<br />
Jensen sighed when he saw all their harsh prying eyes. 'There are days I wish that I could <br />
just give Bart his wish and let him take care of these meetings...' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Gillie looked at Serenity, there was only one answer she could have ever given. She wanted <br />
this Hell over with. And if she had to risk trusting her friend to do it, to trust some Catholic <br />
priests and one weird girl she hadn't met... well... they'd be no no worse off then when <br />
Kurse had for a short time turned the entire world upside down. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do believe that the cure Madam Serenity is suggesting will work. I've known her for two <br />
life times, and I'd trust her with my life and those of my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief Gillie didn't realize just how powerful those words were.<br />
<br />
The Mayor's eyes went wide, 'She's willing to trust her with the lives of the Pride?' <br />
<br />
She had done the equivalent of give a what could best be described as a 'blood oath.' She <br />
gave this promise on the value of her life, this gave this promise on the value of all the <br />
lives of the Glendale Pride, and that meant there was no questioning it. <br />
<br />
The Mayor spoke as if he was addressing a family member now, &quot;I understand Gillie.... tell <br />
me everything that needs to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Death was in the air. The horses' saw something no else could: they screamed and ran. The <br />
ropes dropped, life began to be pulled out of the witches from around their necks... but <br />
with the last remains of their great magic, with the last remains of their vision and plans, <br />
they prevented life from leaving their bodies until their last spell, their last curse was over <br />
and done with.<br />
<br />
Omega-Winifred, Monica, and Rosa felt like they were puppets in a show unable to do <br />
anything or think of anything to do. Only able to watch.... <br />
<br />
All five of the hunters had a powerful feeling of suddenly being trapped. Of being before <br />
two dooms and unable to chose anything but an even WORSE third option. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or... dare....&quot; Kathrine gasped out in fear. <br />
<br />
All three witches' hateful voice echoed through their minds, speaking as one, ~Chose your <br />
doom! Either have your body and mind and precious 'fate' laid bear for us to alter as we <br />
please. Or let the free will you have surrendered to law already be taken from you and <br />
rewritten for as many words as we can think of before we die... and speak soon... or we'll <br />
simply use BOTH! And to make things entertaining for our last act... let your changes or <br />
commands only trigger once we've cursed all five of you!~<br />
<br />
&quot;THEN SIMPLE!&quot; Father Draco called out, trying to be a hero, &quot;I refuse to play your game! AT <br />
ALL! Now your curse can never activate!&quot; <br />
<br />
~HA! You don't answer? At all! We'll accept that answer! AND NOW YOU'LL RECEIVE BOTH <br />
CURSES!~<br />
<br />
 Father Draco felt sick. <br />
<br />
~And so you may know... to prove that you are no different from us at all... any of you still <br />
alive, able to speak, or interact with the World of Man or with the Moving World may pass <br />
on our curse... resist using it for as long as you like, you'll use it eventually... for you'll <br />
have no choice!~<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz knew what the witches would chose if she chose 'Transform' ... being a <br />
mundane stupid beast wasn't really all that bad a fate for her all things considered... <br />
maybe she deserved it. But ... it felt like cowardice... of all the things Marie Cruz <br />
considered herself, a coward had never been one of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
The witches cursed, they seemed to be able to consider something, maybe Daring Marie to <br />
say 'Transform' instead or some other obvious cheat. But then Kathrine said, <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathrine considered the fate of becoming a simple child again, to abandon everything... to <br />
just start over... but she had accepted her marriage the Lord... <br />
<br />
The witches seemed to suddenly change what they were going to say. <br />
<br />
~You handless man, and you rock monster, we'll deal with you in a minute. But you two! <br />
YOU TWO! DOG OF GOD! Marie Cruz! We're Dare you, to kill the person alive who you care <br />
about the most! <br />
<br />
Pink runt leoman, felman, whatever. Fight Marie Cruz to the death at your absolute full <br />
potential as if you had been groomed and trained to be a killer all your life like her.~<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Of course all of Marie-Eliza's audience gasped at this. Even her mother. <br />
<br />
Of course EVERYONE screamed at this point what irredeemable monsters devoid of <br />
anything worthy of sympathy the witches were. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza said, &quot;It runs deeper than that. The witches had intentionally left a loophole. <br />
They had instructed Kathrine to fight her absolute hardest. They hadn't given that same <br />
instruction to Marie Cruz... she could chose to let Kathrine kill her, and have Kathrine live <br />
with that guilt... or kill Kathrine, and live with that guilt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza then continued her tragic tale. None of her audience the heart to interrupt her.</p>
