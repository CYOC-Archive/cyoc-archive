<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rain wondered how far down the rabbit hole of lies she would have to go until things sorted themselves out. <br />
Normally she was an honest person and subscribed to the idea that if you never lied, you would never have to <br />
worry about keeping your story straight, but this was very different. Involuntary morphing, mind control and <br />
reality warping were things that people didn't take too kindly to. The Chronivac was a really, really powerful <br />
device. How it was even available to the general public worried Sean/Rain in the back of his/her mind, but she <br />
was too focused on the here and now to care at the moment. What she was worried now was how to smooth things <br />
over with Sunny. Her brain analyzed and sorted out the possible lies she could tell in order of their <br />
descending effectiveness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay...is my co-worker. Before I changed myself, he actually came over here a lot and all five of us hung out <br />
together from time to time. He was a good guy, but a real chauvinist, and once he saw a new girl in the house <br />
he couldn't wait to get his paws on me. I invited him over today, but once I had gotten the Chronivac I forget <br />
all about our little 'date' and I panicked once he finally showed up. Jay asked who I was and I sort of evaded <br />
his questions until I could get in a word of my own. I flirted with him and asked him to get me a drink from <br />
the kitchen, so he did and that's when I changed him. I turned Jay into Jayne, and she left just before you <br />
got here. As for looks, I made her a solid B+ on the prettiness scale, but she is not as drop dead gorgeous as <br />
you Sunny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't answer why I would forget about him though. I remember Dan before you turned him and his friend <br />
into that&quot;, and she pointed in the direction of Daniele and Misty. &quot;Tell me the truth, Rain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's obvious, Sunny. I turned off awareness of the previous reality for everyone except me. You see, I'm <br />
considered the admin of my Chronivac, and therefore I can keep track of all the different branches, for lack <br />
of a better word, of the old reality as well as the original 'root' reality. As for Daniele and Misty, the <br />
awareness function was turned off for themselves, but left on for everyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'll have to remember to erase the backlogs and get better security just in case Sunny wants to do anything <br />
with the Chronivac' thought Rain.<br />
<br />
Sunny thought about this, considered all the possibilities where Rain might be lying. She couldn't think of <br />
anything air-tight enough to condemn her. Sunny was still suspicious, but was willing to give her friend the <br />
benefit of the doubt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that checks out Rain. You've never lied to me before, but just promise me that you'll never effect my <br />
memories again, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise. I swear. I pinkie swear&quot; answered Rain.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK then&quot;, and Sunny and Rain did a pinkie swear.<br />
<br />
Inside, Rain wondered how far she could keep her promise.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was really kind of an over the top thing to do though. You should change Jay back. I insist on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'll invite him over tomorrow after work and change him.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few feet away, Rain heard heard the two twins yell &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; in unison.<br />
<br />
Rain stomped over to see what was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK, Rain. I can fix it. This happens all the time&quot; said Daniele through her teeth as she went to go get <br />
some towels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain saw that her laptop had died. She rolled her eyes when she noticed  Misty, drunk, on the comfy chair. She <br />
crouched down to look at the computer. Maybe against hope it would work.It didn't. She pressed the power <br />
button and the screen remained dead. Rain then took out the lithium-ion battery.<br />
<br />
'Well, this is just great. Maybe I'll be stuck this way my entire life. Good going Sean, I mean Rain.'<br />
<br />
'At least Danni had enough sense to unplug the power cord.'<br />
<br />
Daniele returned with the towels, but Rain told her to not worry about it and that she would take care of <br />
everything. She then took her computer and the temporarily useless Chronivac emitter and went to her room. She <br />
then dried everything off. All in all, the water damage was minimal, and she thought that if she gave it <br />
another ten hours and a night's sleep or so to completely dry, it might start running again. So she stuffed <br />
the computer and emitter under her bed, and then went outside to say goodnight to the girls.<br />
<br />
Misty was passed out, and Sunny just left through the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rain, do you want anything to drink?&quot; asked Daniele.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks. I'm not in the mood tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo. I hope you're not going emo on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goths have no relations to emo culture. Get your facts straight, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniele giggled. &quot;Kidding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me what you did today&quot; Rain asked.<br />
<br />
Daniele went to sit down. She layed her head on the top of the couch and spread her arms in a relaxing pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;We both went to the bar dressed&quot; and she made a wave with her right hand to express what she was wearing <br />
right now. &quot;We chatted with the bartender for a bit, then we were about to order a few pints of beer, but some <br />
boys from Beta Kappa...something bought us some tequila shots. Misty got hammered on them before I even knew <br />
what was going on, and then we left because there were seven of them and only two of us. I like to play the <br />
odds, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain sat down with her and nodded with a smile. Internally, Rain was excited at what just a few small changes <br />
had done to her life. She couldn't wait to see what else she could do with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door...</p>
