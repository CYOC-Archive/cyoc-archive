<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Krentol for this ending</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The party spent the next few hours preparing for the battle that they knew was ahead of them.  <br />
<br />
Charlie oiled his leather and prepared a handful of smoke bombs and potions.  Veles sat cross-legged in the center of the room, eyes closed, meditating to help restore his constitution.  Geoffrey polished his gauntlets while Jeff sat nearby, the golem’s unblinking eyes fixed not on Geoffrey’s hands, but rather on his paws. <br />
<br />
Then there was Gregory.  He was still in his corner, moaning and laying naked on his side.  His tail was arched over his back.  Cum was still dripping out of his ass and, every so often, he’d vomit up another round of chunky white dog spunk.  <br />
<br />
Palseks, for her part, had spent the time cleaning up after Gregory.  She’d sponge bathed his fur to a silky white clean, then mopped up the cum had pooled beneath both of his holes.  With the area around him clean, she had sat down next to him, slowly rubbing his back while humming a raspy tune and cleaning up whenever something more came out of him.<br />
<br />
“Where do you think the rangers are?” Geoffrey asked as he shined his gauntlets one more time.<br />
<br />
Shortly after being restored, Oswin and friends had gone chasing after Rodrigo, who’d had taken his leave in a dignified by expedient manner the moment that Charles had turned back into Charlie.  Charlie didn’t think Rodrigo posed much of a threat – for all the talk about the curse, Rodrigo didn’t seem like the kind of person to commit suicide.  He’d threaten and yell, but when backed into a corner, he’d beg and plead.<br />
<br />
“My heir is no more, let me live with my fortune and I won’t pass on the curse!” was what Charlie figured he’d say.  And the rangers would be fools not to take him up on his offer, especially since Rodrigo didn’t know that Veles could tailor the curse away.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which – the few rangers who had stayed behind had gone through the wall hole awhile ago but hadn’t yet come back.  Charlie knew that organizing their camp wasn’t a quick task, but they should have been back by now.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the small hole in the wall, Charlie popped his head through into the control room.  But where he had expected to see an anthro lion, tiger, and bear, he instead saw three rats, huddling together in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Charlie yelped, “is that…”<br />
<br />
The three rats looked at him in unison and a flash of hope sprung into their eyes.<br />
<br />
“Squeak! Sqwueeek!” one of the rats shouted as it nodded and gestured to its comrades.<br />
<br />
Charlie jumped through the hole, reached back, and took hold of Shadowblur, but stopped as he approached the rats.  Shadowblur’s hilt was firmly in his hand, but there weren’t any strings coming out of the rats to cut.<br />
<br />
As soon as they saw Charlie stop, the rats all ran towards him, crawling up onto his feet and using their small front paws to tug at his pants.  Charlie looked down and saw three pairs of small, begging eyes, each wondering why he wasn’t freeing them from their new forms.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry…” Charlie began, “there’s nothing for me to cut, I can’t do anything.”<br />
<br />
The rats didn’t let go of his pants, though they did stop tugging as his words sank in.<br />
<br />
“Veles!” Charlie called out to the other room, “come in here.”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for the lithe fox to crawl through the hole, nor for him to appreciate the significance of the three small rats holding onto Charlie’s pantlegs.<br />
<br />
“Examine!”<br />
<br />
One of the rat’s character sheets opened up in front of Veles and with a quick perusal, it was apparent what had happened.<br />
<br />
“Someone, or something got Rodrigo,” Veles said, looking down at the rats.<br />
<br />
“Rodrigo got turned into a rat, so the curse altered their forms as well.  It’s interesting that they kept their minds, but I suppose that’s an academic question on the interplay of curses and tailoring that you don’t need me to go into.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Charlie said, “So there’s nothing we can do?  I was hoping they would at least be bodies to help in the next battle.”<br />
<br />
Veles just shook his head, “I don’t want to screw with trying to tailor away the curse.  That’s way beyond me and I could just end up spreading it to us.  And unless the curse is removed from them, they’ll just revert back to rats no matter what I do.”<br />
<br />
Charlie gently shook the rats off his boots and watched as they scurried a few feet away, “sorry guys, after we’ve beaten this dungeon, we’ll try looking for Rodrigo.  Maybe we’ll be able to do something more for you then.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
“Ssszrath Hrrrassz!”<br />
<br />
“Brrizzst Nuirassz!”<br />
<br />
“Rryzzzath Srrelassz!”<br />
<br />
Glowing images of a snake, hydra, and dragon appeared around each member of the party, swirling around them until the images stretch out into a blur and entered their bodies.<br />
<br />
“Was that draconic?  What did you cast?” Veles asked as he stared down at Palseks.<br />
<br />
“Is easier for Palseks, not sure of word in warm blood tongue.  Is from snake, dragon, and…” Palseks said as she tried to think of the word.<br />
“Lizard but has many head.  Make party more quick, strong, and smart.”<br />
<br />
Veles looked up and down his arm as he flexed his fingers.  His movements felt more fluid and slick, like he was primed to react to anything that could come his way.  Just like Palseks had said, her spells had definitely increased his base stats, and even his creamy white fur looked shinier and smoother.<br />
<br />
But there was more to it than that – there was no such thing as snake’s dexterity, hydra’s strength, dragon’s intellect, or perhaps dragon’s wisdom.  Still, Palsek’s spells had buffed at least some of those stats, which meant that she had cast Enhance Ability on the party.  <br />
<br />
It had never really occurred to Veles that version of the spell that he knew used mammals because, well, he was a mammal.  The fact that there was a reptilian equivalent of that spell certainly made sense, especially since the entire point of the spells was to temporarily weave the caster’s own preconceived notion of something like strength or dexterity into the target.<br />
<br />
So while it did make sense for Palseks to use the reptile equivalents for her version of the spell, it did raise another question – that of compatibility.  Was a reptile’s notion of strength the same as mammal’s?  And how would being infused with the aspect of a hydra affect a wolf or a fox?  In any event, having the essence of a snake slithering through his veins didn’t seem to be having any ill effects…<br />
<br />
Veles’ internal debate was interrupted as Charlie began to speak.<br />
<br />
“So, any questions about the plan?”<br />
<br />
They’d told the rest of the party about the rangers turned rats.  Since those rats were still alive, it might be possible to save Rodrigo and the villagers, but they had to act fast.  That meant no more preparation – they had to attack the boss of the dungeon now.<br />
<br />
Or everyone except Gregory, who was still in the corner, laying on his side in a puddle of fluids.  His reversion from a thoroughly soaked cumrag back into a living creature had come with side effects, and while the party would have liked to wait another day for him to recover, that just wasn’t a possibility if they wanted to have a chance at completing this quest.<br />
<br />
The plan they’d come up with was simple – Jeff would go in first, though not as a combatant.  If Jeff’s body had been made of something like steel or stone, he might have been more effective in battle. As it stood now, however, a wooden golem covered in tanned animal hide probably wasn’t going to be of much use in a fight.  <br />
<br />
But it could most definitely be of some use in distracting the boss – if the boss’s tailoring worked similar to the golem’s transformation beams, then it was a slow process that required him to focus his mind on his current target.  If he could be tricked into targeting Jeff first, then the rest of the party would be able to close the distance in the meantime.  <br />
<br />
It wasn’t a great plan, but they had very little information about what they were going up against, so it would have to do.<br />
Charlie looked around the room, waiting for any objections, but seeing none, he began moving towards the stairs up and said “well, no time like the present.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t like this plan at all.  <br />
<br />
Geoffrey had put his steel boots back on shortly after she’d been transferred into this new, semi-animate body, but that hadn’t stopped her from imagining.  She could feel his velvety white fur pressing into her own tanned pelt, all while his sharp black talons ran gently down her back – pressing ever so slightly into her wooden core.  Not hard enough to cut into her, but enough for them both experience the majesty of Geoffrey’s pristine feet.<br />
<br />
Jeff only wished that she could smell them or, better yet, taste them.  But while she could remember the ability to smell and taste, every since being transformed into a golem with the body of a taxedermied fox, she had completely lost the ability to experience those sensations – either directly or even just imagining them in her mind.<br />
<br />
Still, Jeff had been so lost in the world presented to her by her former body’s feet that she’s simply tuned out most of the conversation that the rest of the party was having.  That was until Charlie had said her name.<br />
<br />
“JEFF.”<br />
<br />
Charlie hadn’t spoken the word with any particular urgency or emotion, but the word nonetheless exploded into her mind, priming her to accept and fulfill a command.<br />
<br />
“Everyone, INCLUDING YOU, is going to FOLLOW BEHIND ME.  Then, when we get to the top of the stairs, YOU’RE going to GO OUT IN FRONT and ACT AS A DECOY.”<br />
<br />
The command had been made and a switch flipped inside of Jeff.  Any thoughts about Geoffrey’s feet immediately vanished, instantly replaced with the knowledge that she was to GO OUT IN FRONT and ACT AS A DECOY.  Every ounce of her being focused in on those words, on that concept.  It wasn’t just a command anymore, it was her entire reason for existence.  <br />
<br />
What had once been her mind no longer was, instead being enslaved to the will of her master.  That didn’t mean that Jeff didn’t still have her own thoughts or wants – she did, and she absolutely did not want to go out in front and subject herself to the depredations of the boss of this place, but she also had no choice.  One of her masters had given a command and so her body would obey.<br />
<br />
“Any objections?”<br />
<br />
The party had all looked to her.  <br />
<br />
They knew what they were asking her to do, and they obviously expected her to protest.  But instead, she just sat there, her unblinking, unmoving eyes staring straight at Charlie.  She wanted to jump up and down in frustration.  She wanted to shake her head.  But her will didn’t matter anymore, and now she was slowly walking up the stairs to the boss, her body moving with robotic precision as it followed Charlie while he disarmed the various traps leading into the next room.<br />
<br />
They reached the top of the steps, and Charlie motioned for Jeff to step out in front.  As her body walked into the entrance of the room, she realized that it wasn’t a room at all but, rather, more of a balcony.<br />
<br />
Across from her was the backside of large, marble chair.  Peaking just over the top of it were two floppy, brown furred ears attached to the top of the head of some sort of anthro dog.  Poking out from the chair’s side was a thick, muscly arm gripping an oversized golden chalice.  <br />
Then, past what was very obviously the boss of this place, was a vast circular arena.  Its floor was covered in sand and, right now, it was filled with dozens of small rats that were all trying to scurry away from a group of tigers that were chasing them down.  <br />
<br />
One of the tigers pounced, snatching a particularly plump rat in its jaws, and the dungeon’s boss brought the chalice inwards and out of Jeff’s view.<br />
<br />
“This is the perfect time, he’s not looking,” Charlie whispered, “GO JEFF.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s body took off on its own, running towards as fast as its wooden legs could carry it.  But Jeff didn’t get far when she felt a wire briefly press into the leather on her front right leg, before breaking with a loud twang.<br />
<br />
A brilliant blue light illuminated the floor below Jeff’s feet, but she couldn’t stop.  She couldn’t even look down – her glass eyes remained fixed forward, and while she could, in theory, have bent her head to look down, her body kept it fixed on the chair in front of her as it obeyed her previous order.<br />
<br />
GO OUT IN FRONT.  ACT AS A DECOY.<br />
<br />
It was obvious to Jeff, the thinking sentient person, that she had just triggered a trap and that she needed to re-evaluate the situation.  But to Jeff, the mindless golem, none of that mattered in the face of her order.  She had to obey.  She had to go out in front and act as a decoy.  The only way that she would be able to deviate from that course of action was if her master commanded otherwise, but nothing came.  <br />
The blocky head of an anthro pitbull peered around the chair, baring its sharp white teeth as scanned over the room, first looking at Jeff charging at him, then to the party behind.<br />
<br />
Jeff got closer and closer, all while the thin fur on the bottom of her paws muffled the clacking they made as her wooden core slammed into the stone ground.  The pitbull stood out of the chair, stepping to the side and revealing his full form.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes were at crotch level, which meant that he was at least ten feet tall.  It also meant that Jeff’s view was fixed on the huge, bulge pressing out into the pitbull’s exquisite leather pants.  His chest was adorned in an equally fine leather smock.  If Jeff didn’t know any better, it seemed like whoever had created that clothing had also been responsible for tanning her own pelt.<br />
<br />
Still fixated on the pitbull in front of her, Jeff’s hindlegs bent down, then leaped into the air towards him.  But for all Jeff’s speed, she was a still golem, and her movements were clunky and choreographed, meaning that the living, agile pitbull had no problem sidestepping out of her way.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s body flew forward, colliding with the stone railing at the edge of the balcony with a loud, but painless thunk.<br />
An impact that would have stunned a being made out of flesh and blood wasn’t even a minor inconvenience to once made out of leather and wood, which meant that Jeff’s body instantly recover and began to turn –<br />
<br />
“STOP”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt her body freeze as master gave her a command and she found herself unable to do anything other than stare straight at the stone railing.<br />
<br />
“TURN AROUND”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s body turned towards the balcony’s entrance, and she found herself staring at the pitbull, who was holding a hand outstretch towards her, moving his index finger up and down almost like he was puppeteer.  Behind him, Jeff could see the rest of the party, all frozen in midstride as the stone below them glowed a soft blue.<br />
<br />
As if sensing her question, the pitbull said, “Changing a golem’s owner is a trivial exercise.  But don’t worry, I won’t have you kill your friends.  That paralysis spell will last more than long enough for me to deal with them.”<br />
<br />
The pitbull looked down and Jeff and chuckled, “that is, of course, after suitably modifying you.”<br />
<br />
He kept holding his hand out towards Jeff, wiggling his fingers as though they were pulling on invisible strings, though Jeff couldn’t see or feel anything.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” the pitbull mused, “you’re such an interesting creature, so many threads.  On the surface, someone turned one of my taxidermies into a golem, but there is so much more underneath.  As much as I would like to play with your possibilities, this magic is beyond anything that I’ve ever seen, so I think a smaller modification will suffice until I can study you further.”<br />
<br />
“COME” the pitbull said as he walked away.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the command pass through her body as the irresistible impulse to obey forced her to turn and follow.  <br />
<br />
With her vision fixed forward, Jeff’s view of the area had previously been limited, but as she turned she got a much better view of the area.  Next to the pitbull’s chair there was a long wooden dining table, past which was a door leading to a bedroom, which she found herself following the pitbull towards.<br />
<br />
In the center of the bedroom was a large stone coffin with an open lid, surrounded by four statues that looks like they were a cross between badgers and dogs.  <br />
<br />
But as they entered the room, the pitbull didn’t head towards the coffin.  Instead, he turned to side and opened a door leading to a small closet.<br />
<br />
“LOOK.”<br />
<br />
Jeff moved next to the pitbull and looked inside the closet.  It was a modestly sized walk in style room, with racks filled with a mixture of leather and cloth gear – nearly all of which had a vaguely Roman theme to it.  But what caught her attention wasn’t the pitbull’s clothing, but rather the dolls that sat below them.<br />
<br />
Ringing the room were a series of lifesized sex dolls - some male, some female, some both, and some neither.  It was a vast assortment of anthropomorphic toys and nearly every species was represented, from German Shepards, to lions, to alligators, the pitbull had a huge selection to suit his every whim and need.<br />
<br />
If Jeff had a heart, it would have been pumping in her chest.  While her face may have been fixed in an emotionless stare, her mind knew better.  It was a thought she never wanted to have, but one that was unavoidable at this point – she was going to spend the rest of her life in this closet, only seeing the outside when in use.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” the pibtull said, as if reading her mind, “I said I didn’t want to modify you too much, and I’m not into ferals.”<br />
<br />
“No,” he continued, “you’re going to make a toy for whatever survives each day in the arena.”<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly turned her head to look at the pitbull, and watched as he held one hand outstretched towards her, while the other was stretched towards the dolls inside the room, all while his fingers twitched back and forth, tugging at invisible strings.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the bottoms of her paws compress as the wood that formed the core of her body began to soften as long, sturdy fibers of cellulose and lining began to break down and reform into a lightweight, naturally porous plastic.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s entire body became more springy and flexible, and while her legs could still support her body’s weight, she had to actively try to counteract her limbs intrinsic tendency to bend in on themselves.<br />
<br />
Then the changes hit her hide – previously made out of real fox leather and fur – which began to merge with the rubber that made up the rest of her core.  Jeff didn’t know what the material was shifting into, but her fur coat remained intact, as the pitbull’s spell created an unnatural fusion of rubber and leather.<br />
<br />
Then the changes hit the back of her throat.  Previously a solid piece of cloth, a thick rubber tube began growing out of the back of her mouth, merging with her tongue and cheeks, until all she could feel inside was a gaping hole that opened up at the end of her muzzle.<br />
The same process repeated with it’s ass – previously sewn shut, the stiches evaporated as a thick rubber tube took the place of the fox’s former anus.<br />
<br />
The feeling of cold air inside of the two open holes on either side of it was disturbing, particularly since it wanted to press both of them shut, but found itself unable to do so.  Then, it began to feel an odd dampness as a thick, gooey lubricant began to magically form along the walls of the new simulated assholes.<br />
<br />
The pitbull reached down, placing one hand on the top of its muzzle and another just above the base of its tail.  Then the pitbull jammed a thumb in both of Jeff’s new holes, and it found itself involuntarily reacting to the unwanted act of penetration.<br />
<br />
It felt so good to have something inside of it, and whereas just seconds ago Jeff had been completely unable to move either of the tough rubber holes, he now found himself sucking down in a rhythmic, wormlike manner on the appendages stuck inside of itself.  Jeff could feel the oily lubricant between its soft rubber walls and the pitbull’s tough leathery skin, and all it could think about was having something bigger pressed deeper inside of it…<br />
<br />
There was a wet popping noise as the pitbull jerked its thumbs out of Jeff, and its new “mouth” and “ass” immediately stopped their sucking.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, self-lubricating, the beasts will just love you,” the pitbull cooed.<br />
<br />
Then Jeff felt the pitbull reach down between its legs, before saying, “I’ve got another surprise for you too.”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt something press up against the underside of his crotch, and suddenly he could feel his thick, hard cock dangling beneath him.  Thoughts of fucking shot through his mind – bitches, vixens, sows, hens – it didn’t matter.  There was an intense feeling of warmth and pressure in his cock, like there was a massive waterfall inside of him that needed to come out.  That needed him to find a pussy, ass, mouth, or anything to stick himself into and fuck silly.<br />
<br />
Then he felt the pitbull place a finger on the top of his cock and, with a snap, both it’s cock and that feeling was gone.<br />
<br />
Next, the pitbull placed a finger on its backside, just below its artificial ass, before pressing something thick and fleshy into a pre-made slit in Jeff’s body.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt herself overcome with a new need as a fire filled the inside of her stomach.  All she could think about was having a big, heavy animal jump on top of her back, weighing her down before pressing inside of her.  She wanted to squeeze, pump, and milk its warm, delicious cock until it exploded inside of her.<br />
<br />
She could feel her new netherlips and the passage that led deep inside of her, and while she could imagine a cock thrust inside of her, and the internal caress that she would give it, just like with her mouth and ass, she found herself completely incapable of moving her new organ.  The only way she could do that – and find relief – was with something inside of her.<br />
<br />
“Are you feeling it?” the pitbull asked, “I’ve always wondered what its like for dolls with that thread wrapped around their soul.  They never look any different than the other dolls, but their experience must be an entirely different world.”<br />
<br />
Jeff just stood there, her rubber legs struggling to hold her upright, as she stared as the sex doll in front of her.  It was an anthro golden retriever, but that’s not what she cared about.  With the fire burning through her belly, the only thing she could focus on was the doll’s huge, red rubber cock.  Stuck in a permanent erection, she could only imagine what it would feel like to have it inside of any of her holes – she didn’t even care which.<br />
<br />
And that dildo cock only inches away from her muzzle.  So close, all it would take was the slightest movement and she would be on it, wrapping her “mouth” around its delicious rubber.  But no matter how badly she wanted to, her body wouldn’t move.<br />
<br />
LOOK<br />
<br />
That was the command she’d been given.  To look.  To gaze upon the splendor that was the doll’s cock, forever unable to grasp it for herself.<br />
<br />
The pitbull chuffed at her, “as you’ve probably realized, you have a few attachments. I have beasts of all genders and orientations, and you’re going to be able to please every one of them.  Speaking of which, I really should get you down to the menagerie, but first I need to deal with your friends.  So, WAIT THERE UNTIL I COME BACK, then we’ll figure out what parts you’ll need for tonight.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Charlie was forced to watch as the long, black threads emerged from the pitbull’s fingers, piecing into the animate, taxidermied fox that was his friend Jeff.  Still able to move his eyes, Charlie had been able to follow the pair as they walked past the dining table to his right but, unable to move his head, that was as far as he was able to track.<br />
<br />
Charlie spent the next few minutes in silence.  From the blue glow beneath him, it was obvious what had happened.  He’d scanned the stairway for traps, disarming them as he found them.  Then he’d reached the top of the stairs and sounded the all clear, but whether it was the result of a natural one, a low roll, or just an absurdly high skill trap, the last tripwire had eluded him.<br />
<br />
Jeff had then charged through it, triggering the paralysis trap when its leg snapped the wire.  As a technically inanimate object, Jeff was immune to the trap, so it had kept going, but the rest of the party wasn’t so fortunate.  Now stuck in their battle poses, all they could do was wait for the pitbull to come back for them – and to hope that Finn would have mercy when they lost. <br />
<br />
It was a difficult wait.  Would Finn just respawn them as is?  Charlie had obviously been respawned once before, but he had no memory of the events that led to it.  That meant that Finn had wiped them, which also meant that might not be the first time he’d lost.  So, what about this time?  Would Charlie remember?  Or was this entire experience about the vanish from his mind, leaving him powerless to avoid the trap the next time around?<br />
<br />
Charlie was in the middle of wishing that he could talk to the rest of the party when the pitbull began to saunter back into view.  Walking up to Charlie, the pitbull pressed a clawed finger to the bottom of Charlie’s muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, ordinarily I like to listen to my prey beg, but you seem powerful enough that indulging myself might not be the best idea…”<br />
<br />
Charlie’s mind began to race – this world might feel real, but it was really all just a big game, and the pitbull standing in front of him was an archetypal cartoon villain.  As the villain continued to rub Charlie’s muzzle while pondering whether to release him or not, Charlie could only think that there was still a shred of hope.  Maybe, just maybe, this villain would be dumb enough to recite a monologue about conquering the world, then release the spell so that he could listen to the ‘final words’ of Charlie and friends.<br />
<br />
The pitbull took a step back and outstretched his fingers, all while Charlie held his breath…<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
Black threads shot out of each of the pitbull’s claws, some piercing into Charlie’s body, while the others passed around him to target his friends.<br />
<br />
The effect that the threads had on Charlie was immediate – dozens of new threads exploded out of his chest, as though his very being was unraveling in front of him.  Each of Charlie’s threads extended out about two feet in front of him, and each terminated in a ghostly picture that hang in the air.  A wolf, a human, a dagger, a mars symbol, and dozens of other images describing Charlie’s ever attribute were just hanging there for the pitbull to see.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” the pitbull mused as he sifted through Charlie’s threads.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Snake’s Speed.  This will do,” he said as Charlie’s threads all seemed to weave back into his body, leaving only a single thread with the image of a snake left.<br />
<br />
“Now for the rest of you.”<br />
<br />
The pitbull stopped looking at Charlie, and began concentrating on the other party members behind him.  Anthrax or whatever his name was would fiddle his fingers, muse about how a particular thread would suit his purpose, then move on to the next person.  <br />
“Hah!” the pitbull shouted as he snapped his fingers, “and now to finish you up.”<br />
<br />
Charlie felt a pulling sensation inside of him as the snake thread coiled back behind him.  He could vaguely feel it wiggling towards his party members, and then, strangely, it felt like it was intertwining with other threads.  Threads coming from them.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s body began to slide backwards, until he felt his tail press into something soft and fleshy behind him.  Warm blood began to flow up his tail and into the rest of his body as Charlie slowly lost feeling in tail.  The numbness kept moving up until he felt his ass cheeks and thighs press up against another, fleshy set of ass cheeks and thighs.  While he couldn’t turn around, from the side and flabbiness of the warm mounds pressing up against him, it was obvious that his body was squished up against Geoffrey’s butt.<br />
<br />
The numbness spread to Charlie’s feet and soon, just like his tail, they too vanished into nothing.  It moved up legs as they seemed to pull up into his lower body, the flesh slowly being reabsorbed into his torso.  But perhaps reabsorbing was the wrong word, Charlie thought, since that would imply that the mass was being redistributed to his abdomen – which very much wasn’t the case.<br />
<br />
Instead, he could feel his body slimming and lengthening as more ribs began to grow out of his spine.  While Charlie had expected the disappearance of his legs to eventually result in him falling face first into the ground, the feeling of his pelvis vanishing, along with everything else below it, was also met with the a tugging feeling coming from the base of his extending spine – almost like his spine was attached to something else that was anchoring him in midair.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s eyelids vanished fused into a transparent covering as he was forced to watch the black fur of his muzzle fall away, only to be replaced by brilliant green scales.  Then the world grew muffled as his ears merged back into his head, leaving only small, scaley holes on either side.  Next his forehead vanished as his entire head compressed into the blunt, narrow muzzle of snake.<br />
<br />
His teeth retreated into his gums, only to be replaced by two thin fangs that tucked up against the roof of his mouth.  His lips, meanwhile, hardened as thick scales grew over them.<br />
<br />
Next came his arms.  Just like his legs, first his hands faded into nothingness, then his arms slowly withered towards his body, before there was nothing left.  Finally, his shoulder blades disintegrated, leaving him as little more than a head attached to a long spine, attached to… something else.  Something that he wished he could turn around to see.<br />
<br />
There was a burrowing sensation, as a new tube burrowed its way into Charlie’s body from whatever it was he was attached to.  He could feel the tube growing up inside of him, replacing all of his internal organ, until it reached his small snake heart and lungs.  They didn’t last long until the tube had absorbed them and his breathing stopped.  His blood didn’t stop flowing though, as he could feel it being pumped through his body from behind.<br />
<br />
Finally, the tube reached the back of his throat, and two strange sensations came over him.  The first was his throat itself – it felt like it was closing up but, at the same, time, it became more sensitive and his level of awareness of it increased.  Almost like it was now made up of a thick muscle that was stuck clench shut.<br />
<br />
The next was his tongue.  Charlie wasn’t stupid, he knew that he was turning into a snake.  Like any other snake, he expected for his tongue to transform into the long, wiring tongue that he would be using to taste the air from now on – but that wasn’t what happened.  Instead, his tongue felt like it was growing… blunter?  He wasn’t sure how to describe it, but it definitely was not getting any longer.  And, more disturbingly, although he could feel the thing, flat organ at the base of his mouth, he found himself completely unable to move it.<br />
That latter bit wasn’t an effect of the paralysis spell.  While he couldn’t move any of his body right now, he could at least feel the muscles and the potential for movement.  But his tongue was different.  It wasn’t that he couldn’t the muscles, it was that there were no muscles to move.  It just felt like a small, blunt piece of flesh, permanently affixed to the bottom of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Charlie was still staring out at the pitbull as the final changes finished and his body took the form that he would have until Finn saw fit to make it otherwise.<br />
<br />
The pitbull clasped his hands together and shouted, “Perfect, you’ll make a fine combatant for the-“<br />
<br />
The world seemed to pop out of place, and suddenly Charlie found himself in a cavernous room lined with marbled walls.  Treasure was piled along the edges of the room, while in the center sat a sort of magic ball looking orb, next to which was a massive red dragon – Finn.<br />
<br />
The dragon looked Charlie straight in the eyes, then with a deep bellow, asked, “are you all enjoying your new form?”<br />
<br />
Charlie found himself able to move again, and he used the opportunity to coil his body back and get a look at himself.<br />
<br />
Just like he had expected, his new body was that of a long, thin, green snake.  Then he saw the point at which his sensation of touch vanished – his body continued back until it merged at the base of a huge, green, four-legged lizard, as just the point where its tail should be.<br />
It had two thick, well-muscled thighs that led down to two feet topped with wicked, sharp black talons.  Although its torso looked like it belonged on a crocodile, its posture was unlike anything Charlie had seen outside of the game – its legs were splayed out slightly to the side, but also still held the main body high off the ground.  It wasn’t quite like the posture of an animal like a horse, but it also wasn’t quite like a typical lizard either.  It was more like something in between, like a disfigured dragon or a…<br />
<br />
Charlie looked to the head of the creature that he was attached to.  Or, rather, the heads.  Jutting out of the body’s torso were two long, thick necks, each topped with a decidedly draconic muzzle, both of which were doing the same thing that Charlie currently was and checking out their new body – the body of a hydra.  Charlie had been turned into the creature’s ‘tail’, while the other two were its new heads.<br />
Which raised another question – there had been four party members who fell victim to the trap: Charlie, Veles, Geoffrey, and Palseks, but only three of them were accounted for in this new body.<br />
<br />
Knowing what that might mean, Charlie moved his snake body down between hydra’s legs, looking for a cock, ass, or slit, but finding nothing.  He even ran his muzzle along the scales that made up the hydra’s underside, looking for a well-hidden vent, but all his nose pressed against was solid flesh.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Finn…” came a deep voice from one of Charlie’s two main heads.<br />
<br />
“Could you, you know, change us back?”<br />
<br />
A loud chuckled echoed through the room, “No.”<br />
<br />
“Finn, I know you’ve had a lot of fun with this game, but you’re scaring me.”<br />
<br />
There was a pause, before Finn growled back, “you should be scared.  Look at what you did to my boyfriend!”<br />
<br />
Charlie brought himself back up from between ‘his’ thighs and looked around the room, through it didn’t take him long to spot the five foot tall, fox sex doll that was trying to walk slowly towards the dragon, but finding it difficult to do so as it’s rubber body wobbled and jiggled with every step.<br />
<br />
“What am I supposed to do with this?” the dragon asked as it beckoned towards the doll. “It didn’t even get teleported back with any of the attachments, all it has is that vixen cunt that was stuck in it when I teleported it out!”<br />
<br />
Finn plodded over to Jeff the sexdoll, picked it up in his claw and brought it up to his face.<br />
<br />
“Useless!” Finn cried out as he tossed the sexdoll into the air, causing it to crash into the ground next to Charlie with a loud thump.  <br />
Seemingly unphased by the impact of its rubber body with the marbled floor, the doll just stood up, first looking at Finn, before turning its attention towards the hydra heads and finally towards Charlie.  The two briefly looked at towards one another, each staring at the other with unblinking eyes.<br />
<br />
“Finn,” one of Charlie’s hydra heads said, “you can just turn him back-“<br />
<br />
“Its not that simple you stupid animal!” Finn cried out in return, before holding up a tablet.<br />
<br />
“No, Finn!  Don… rrrrggggghhhhh” Charlie’s head cried out as its words turned into the incomprehensible noises of a simple beast.<br />
“Better.” Finn said, before turning his attention to Charlie.<br />
<br />
The dragon lowered his massive head towards the small snake, “as for both of you.  You said that you would save my boyfriend, but look at how he ended up! Who the FUCK thought it was a good idea to send my boyfriend out as bait when you knew I needed him? Me, the GOD of that world, for all intents and purposes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought we or you could change him back!&quot; Charlie protested with a hiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie.&quot; Finn said flatly. &quot;At what point did you think using my boyfriend as bait was acceptable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well, he was there and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough.&quot; Finn clamped Charlie&#39;s reptilian muzzle shut between two sharp claws. &quot;You didn’t seem to mind spewing shit back then, so I think that’s all you’re going to do from now on.”<br />
<br />
Charlie felt his throat clench itself together as the realization of what Finn’s words meant dawned on him.<br />
<br />
“That just leaves poor Palseks, but perhaps he can be of some use to my former boyfriend…”<br />
<br />
With that, Finn back away from Charlie’s face, leaving Jeff the sexdoll to strut up to him.  The rubber vixen turned until her rear end was facing Charlie, then began to slowly back up towards him with her tail raised, showing of both her gaping, wet asshole and tight artificial vagina that sat just below it.<br />
<br />
That’s when Charlie felt a strange pressure in his tongue, which began to grow larger until it got so big that was forced to open his jaws and let it hang out.  That’s when he saw it – sticking out in front of his muzzle was a flat red piece of flesh that ended in a smooth tapered point.  And that’s when he realized how sensitive it was.<br />
<br />
He could feel the blow pulsing into it, causing it to grow larger and more rigid with every heartbeat.  It felt so tight, hard, and… needy, and Charlie realized how good it would feel to press it inside of the sexdoll in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Yessss,” Finn hissed from a distance, “Palseks there will be an excellent source of relief for my former boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
But Charlie wasn’t listening anymore.  All he could think of was the moist cunt in front of him, and the hard cock hanging out of his mouth.  With the sex doll’s hole just inches away, Charlie opened his mouth wide, then thrust forward as his friend turned cock entered his friend turned toy.<br />
<br />
Charlie could feel the toy’s depths oozing inside as they wrapped around him, all while he pulled his body back and forth, pressing in until his jaws sank into the toy’s soft rubbery fur, then retreating back ever so slightly, before repeating the process again.<br />
<br />
He felt the pleasure building up in his tongue as jolts of warm electricity surged through his head.  The pressure built, the toy’s walls squeezed, and then, with a sudden burst, there was an explosion of thick fluid that flowed out along Charlie’s jaw, up into his tongue, and then out into the toy.<br />
<br />
He could feel the blood pumping through his body – and from the satisfying coos coming from his body’s main heads, it was apparent that while his sensation of touch ended at the point where their spines merged, the same was not true for the body’s others heads.<br />
<br />
Charlie pulled out, mouth still agape as his partially erect cock tongue hung down, dripping a mixture of artificial lube and hydra cum.  Then, as the lust faded, he looked back up at Finn, wondering when it was that Finn was going to send them back into the game.<br />
<br />
“Soon, but I’m not changing you back.  I’ve had some other groups show interest, so you’re going back to live out your lives as that thing.” Finn said rather bluntly, “and yes, the Chronivac can read your thoughts, snake Charlie.”<br />
<br />
Finn paused, before saying, “and yes, yours too, ass Charlie.”<br />
<br />
“You failed in the most spectacular way possible, and failure must be punished.” Finn brought a claw to his chin, &quot;I think it’s time that both of you got used to your other role, though I don’t want a mess here so…”<br />
<br />
Charlie extended his body as far towards Finn as he could, then opened his mouth, only to find that his limbless, snake body was incapable of gesturing, and the asshole in the back of his mouth was incapable of making any noise.<br />
<br />
Finn’s lair faded away, only to be replaced by the stone walls and straw floor of a stall in a barn designed for exotic animals.  In the corner laid Jeff, the fox sex doll golem, but that wasn’t what concerned Charlie at the moment.<br />
<br />
No, what he was most concerned about was the feeling of something big enter into the tube running through his body, as it slowly made its was closer and closer to his mouth.  He closed it tight, hoping that might delay the inevitable, but the pressure in the back of his throat only continued to grow.<br />
<br />
“No!  No!  No!”  Charlie screamed internally, but it was no use.  The hydra’s intestine only moved its contents in one direction, and as Finn rewrote the hydra’s backstory to include the cow it had eaten the night before, there was simply far too much of the cow left over for it to go to any other place.<br />
<br />
Charlie felt his throat clench and he wanted to close eyes, but they were already closed.  It just didn’t matter with his new, transparent eyelids.  And as the bulk inside of him came to rest at the top of his neck, the smell of putrefied cow flesh began to build up in the back of his head before.<br />
<br />
“Pfffttt.”<br />
<br />
A blast of rotten air exploded out through Charlie’s nostrils and he prepared for the worst.  All he could hope for was that Palseks was more of a cock and less of a tongue, and that neither of them would have to taste what was about to come out.<br />
“Ha! Sorry Charlie, looks like you’re just…” <br />
<br />
THE END<br />
