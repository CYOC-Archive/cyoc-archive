<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony was shocked how could he possibly go back to school like this, even if he found clothes that would fit him there was 
<br>
 no way he was going back there. What would happen if this ass whole who says he did this didn't help him out, there were 
<br>
 still guys who would love to kick his ass, how could he possibly believe that this big guy had made these guys forget every 
<br>
 thing and just treat him as a wimp, Tony knew from experience that picking on the little guys really didn't get you much 
<br>
 respect, but picking on one of the bullies that had suddenly been turned into a wimp was by his own experience acceptable. 
<br>

<br>
 But what choice did he have he didn't want to be stuck in this positively puny body for the rest of his life, and right now 
<br>
 that's the way it seemed it might be if he didn't comply with this guy. Tony reluctantly went into his house he would have 
<br>
 to get cleaned up and find something that he could wear, he knew that he didn't have anything that would fit him now but his 
<br>
 younger might, he was smaller than Tony was, but now he would surely be alot bigger than he was now, but he just might have 
<br>
 something that would half way fit, he would need one of his little brothers belts to hold them up till he got some clothes 
<br>
 that would fit his now frail thin body. 
<br>

<br>
 Tony's mom wasn't home and that made Tony feel better he definitely didn't want her to see her once proud stud of a son 
<br>
 looking like a little wimp. Tony went to take a shower he was sweaty and smelled like urine and just wanted to feel clean 
<br>
 again, but as he got undressed he couldn't help but see how different he really looked now, he couldn't believe it all those 
<br>
 long days in the gyms weight training room were now a waist of his time he was a skeleton and every bone in his now 
<br>
 pathetic body showed, he could see his pelvic bone, and and hips and even make out where his leg bones connected to them, 
<br>
 his elbows and knees were knobby and bonny, and his chest was a bonny rib cage covered by a thin layer of only skin, no 
<br>
 muscles showed any where on his thin frame, his quarter sized nips rested on skin covered bones that made him look like a 
<br>
 war refugee. 
<br>

<br>
 Tony cried as he showered and he cried even more when he had to wash off his once proud cock, wasn't it enough for this 
<br>
 ass whole to take his muscles, why did he have to shrink his penis too? And to a child's size at that, why?? Tony just couldn't 
<br>
 figure out what he did to this guy, it must have been pretty bad though and in his mind he vowed that he would change if 
<br>
 the guy ever put things back the way they were, he would never pick on a smaller guy again. 
<br>

<br>
 Tony reluctantly went into his little brothers room, he definitely was not looking forward to seeing how much bigger he 
<br>
 was than he was now but he new that he was, Tony knew that his brother emulated him and was lifting weights so he could be 
<br>
 as big as his big brother was, Tony saw the scales that were normally in the main bathroom were now in his little brother 
<br>
 Bradley's room, the little guy must be keeping up with his progress, Tony thought as he reluctantly climbed on to the 
<br>
 scales, he couldn't help it it was almost instinct, after all he had kept up with his own weight gains over the years but 
<br>
 he was not prepared for what he would see now, 95LBS &quot;Oh god no I cant weigh only 95LBS!!!&quot; Tony said out loud, he got off 
<br>
 the scales and hoped that his brother had messed the reading up but it went back to dead zero and he knew it was right. 
<br>

<br>
 Tony went to his brothers drawers and looked for something that would fit him, and nothing that was new would, what was 
<br>
 he going to wear he couldn't wear anything of his once littler brothers clothes, not a dam thing his little brother was now 
<br>
 the bigger son, and Tony was going to have to be the little guy for at least a another week if the big guy kept his 
<br>
 promise, but that was a big if to Tony!! 
<br>

<br>
 Tony finally found some old jeans that his little brother had worn about two years ago, they were to short in the legs 
<br>
 though and now to big on his narrow hips! What was he going to wear, he certainly couldn't wear these, Tony sat down on his 
<br>
 ass before the too short pair of to big waisted jeans fell down his narrow legs and hit the ground as hard as he could with 
<br>
 his bonny fist. 
<br>

<br>
 Tony finally did manage to find something that with the help of a belt would fit him well enough to go to the mall where 
<br>
 if he was lucky he might find something that would fit him. When Tony got to the mall though he wasn't in any better shape 
<br>
 though every where he went they told him that they didn't handle any thing in his size he was just to thin, every time he 
<br>
 walked into a store or for that matter any where in the mall he could hear the comments about the little skinny guy and 
<br>
 about how stupid his present clothes looked on him, 
<br>

<br>
 Tony was beginning to give up as he approached the last store in the mall it was the sears store and it was also his last 
<br>
 stop, he had had enough of all the comments about his new size that he could possibly stand. Tony went to the kids size 
<br>
 department and looked at some jeans he thought might be long enough for him they were a size 25-30 the very smallest waist 
<br>
 size at that length, he knew he wasn't any shorter than before he was just impossibly thin for his 5'9&quot; body, and that at 
<br>
 that size these jeans would be floods on him for sure. He reluctantly went to the changing room and tried them on, he 
<br>
 looked in the mirror as he buttoned the waist, even at that size the waist was a bit loose and the legs were to roomy and 
<br>
 the ass hung nearly strait down he looked so tiny in the jeans, but what was worse was that they were indeed floods and 
<br>
 made him look like the ultimate geekaziod, that along with the new acne problem that he only just now seemed to notice 
<br>
 Tony reluctantly bought the jeans, again what choice did he have now.</p>
