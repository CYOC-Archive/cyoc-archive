<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The large gray wolf made little sound as it padded through the forest, save for the panicked puttering escaping from its fluffy hindquarters. The beast seemed to pay very little mind however as it continued along its course. If one were to happen upon the scene, they would be met with the bizarre site of a massive wolf farting continuously as it trekked along, its anus sporadically twitching with a mind of its own. What they would most assuredly be ignorant of was that this flatulent display was in fact a series of frantic shouts as this particular wolf had a human trapped as it&#39;s anus. The forest was still which only amplified the sound of the wolf unceremoniously passing gas. The cacophony of poots, toots, and squeaks of escaping gas were carried along the calm winds blowing through the trees. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Behind the lupine, located just below the base of its tail was where you found your new station in life. You had discovered that with great effort you were able to assert partial control over yourself despite being absorbed into the wolf. You been screaming for what felt like an hour now, desperately trying get the attention of anyone that could help. They were useless efforts of course as not a single soul was around to help you this deep in the forest. The wolf had swiftly moved deeper into the large woods. With each step it carried you farther and farther away from civilization as well as salvation. Not that it would have mattered anyway. No one could possibly have the faintest suspicion that you were the animal&#39;s anus, even if they did, who would be fool enough to run up on a wolf? <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 In your present state you were at best essentially manipulating the creature&#39;s anus as a means to talk, and an anus was a poor substitute for the structures necessary to facilitate speech. As the wolf&#39;s butt-hole your voice was audible as only an unintelligible series of small, gaseous discharges that varied in pitch and tone.  You went silent when you realized the futility. That and the fetid stench was becoming overwhelming. Your new form meant that each time you tried to open your mouth to speak you expelled the canine&#39;s flatus with every &quot;breath.&quot; Your were literally belching out its farts! Instead you resigned yourself to fate while the gravity of the situation set in. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
t did not seem real, but you had actually become part of the wolf. You had been assimilated and re-purposed into the wolf&#39;s turd cutter! At the very moment the changes progressed within your host. Old nerve endings were overwritten and fused into new ones, whatever you felt in your sphincter form so would your owner and vice versa. At any moment the canine could exert total control over you, effectively wresting what limited ability you had to clench or quiver away. Your human blood vessels were rapidly integrated into your savage host&#39;s circulatory system as a wolf&#39;s heart now pumped wolven blood into you, replacing your own. Homo sapiens DNA met that of canis lupus as your very genetic structure was eviscerated and intermingled with the genetic code of the wolf. Even here the animal proved dominant as the new DNA strand forged from the joining remained 99.9 percent gray wolf while the remaining .01 that was human was carried as random bits of recessive genetic sequences. This equated to the puckered surface of your new form changing in hue and texture to match those of your former skin. That is all. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Bone, organs and the like. Most of your former mass had been converted into energy and consumed as fuel for whatever biological processes took place during your transformation. what was left was stored as superfluous mass, a small layer of fatty tissue on the canid&#39;s rump and thighs. There was not much of yourself left at all. Though right now you were grateful to still be able to form complete thoughts despite no longer having a brain. If you had been turned into an inert sphincter, then you would truly have been lost. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It was at this point that you detected a heady scent. In all that was happening you only not realized that your new master was actually mistress. A plump vulva was set just below you indicating that you had indeed been absorbed into a female wolf. The powerful musk wafting up to you was the scent of her genitalia. As if to add insult injury it appears you had an involuntary sex change. Your very identity had been taken away! <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The she-wolf carried on, not bothering to acknowledge you in the slightest, content to leave you confined to her rear. As far as her primitive mind was concerned you no longer existed as a separate entity. You were just an extension of herself, no different than her tail that hid you away from the rest of the world. You had no idea where you were headed. There was very real possibility that you would not make it out of this in a way that did not involve living the rest of your days out as the end of your new mistress’ digestive tract. Your lives interconnected, not even being granted death’s sweet kiss as you would only die when the wolf itself perished, and in the mean time you would be forced to endure hot wolf farts and shit being forced out from between your puckered “lips” on the daily basis. You were in a horrible spot, and the outlook was grim. Maybe it was time to face it, your options weren&#39;t looking good. You prayed to God for a miracle, that you would be woken up from this nightmare!</p>
