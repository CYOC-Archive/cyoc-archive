<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward wondered, was the Kitsune on the cover meant to be Edward? If the book was meant for Edward after all. Edward wondered how that would go or how that change would come about.<br />
<br />
&#39;The world is your harem,&#39; was the title of the books, even if Edward and his harem was made immortal, there was no way Edward could transform every humans on the planet, population growth would make it impossible. Maybe once Edward was a kitsune and he&#39;d hit critical mass with his harem he&#39;d gain new tricks for changing more humans at once?  What about infrastructure? And what if he say changed someone&#39;s grandfather? These were all questions he realized the instructions hadn&#39;t given.<br />
<br />
If he were delusional in an padded cell, or in a dream, he might as well enjoy it. And if this was really gonna be his fantasies, then he might was well exploit it the hilt. But before he went all out and rampaged transforming every human he saw, there were a few fantasies he wanted done first. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be going now... &quot; What was her name again? &quot;Helen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry Master! Is there anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... just keep looking after the shop until I have need of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes Master! I shall obey!&quot; The purple dressed harem coyote bowed. <br />
<br />
Taking &#39;The World is Your Harem&#39; with him,  Edward still wondered if this was some cosmic joke that was gonna be pulled out from under him if he weren&#39;t crazy, but might as well enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Outside the thrift store, it was strange thinking this purple book said it was all his to twist into his world. Now how were he going to get there? His car hadn&#39;t worked in years and he didn&#39;t feel like walking. The bus held obvious possibilities, but he didn&#39;t want to overwhelm things first. <br />
<br />
A modest rusty brown car drove near and parked next to the thrift store. Edward thought, &#39;Opportunity knocks.&#39; <br />
<br />
He walked over to the other side, and saw a teenage woman at the wheel. She wearing a red sweeter and jeans with blond hair tied up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, I could use a ride,&quot; he said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Look, I don&#39;t feel comfortable giving rides to strangers and-&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward flipped the page in the book. And she changed to match her new reality. She aged right into her prime. Her figure became more squat, but also bulkier. Black and white fur covered her body as her car actually changed to fit her lager frame. Her hands and feet became like paws except for an opposable thumb, while her head became like that of a panda except for the glint of human intelligence. And the tiny black tails on her rump. As for the panda woman&#39;s clothes... it was a joke to even call them that. Transparent green cloth with a golden trim appeared on the sides of her hips, linked together with a string of golden rings. Gold bracelets formed on her wrists and ankles. The strips of clothes around her bosom were as good as transparent held together by another golden chain.<br />
<br />
&quot;-you of course are no stranger Master! Where do you wish to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet&#39;s house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Are you sure that&#39;s wise Master?&quot; She asked in concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me worry about that, I&#39;ve got it handled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Master.&quot; The panda woman bowed her head. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lacy Winds<br />
Race: Panda<br />
The Master&#39;s personal chauffeur since she first leaned how to dive, she&#39;d spent her whole life hoping to be someone&#39;s personal driver, and was overjoyed when Master chose her.  She has knowledge of basic car repair and has every road and traffic pattern memorized, and could drive a f-1 race with her feet if need be. She enjoys her position always grants her time with Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
Edward hop in, he didn&#39;t need to tell Lacy where go. She drives through the town without having hit a light even once. She made no attempt to small talk, simply smiling and humming to herself as she went. He placed a hand on her shoulder and she only reacts by smiling a bit more.<br />
<br />
They came to the small house he hadn&#39;t seen the inside of in years. Lacy parked flawlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall I keep the motor running  Master? Or come inside with you for your protection?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, I&#39;ve got this,&quot; he said taking &#39;The World is Your Harem: Claim Your Rightful Place as Master of All&#39; with him. <br />
<br />
Edward hopped up to the front door, his heart pounding as he knocked.<br />
<br />
A woman his age opened the door, long brown hair, tanned skin, wearing a violet dress. Her eyes narrowed at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it Scarlet?&quot; Called a male voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a big ugly rat, I&#39;ll chase it away,&quot; she sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, Edward!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam came storming to the storm. &quot;You little prick, what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just here to try and fix things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing to fix, freak,&quot; Scarlet said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shared my tastes with you because I thought you&#39;d understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing to understand! Animal humping sicko.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I was a furry. And what about Adam&#39;s leather fetish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam went red in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam is NORMAL! Unlike you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the two harem anthros I have?&quot; Edward asked remembering what the book said about everyone remembering the harem as they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are normal,&quot; Scarlet said with a roll of her eyes. &quot;Now get going before I-&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;d opened the book and turned the page.<br />
<br />
You were surprised when the picture showed more than one harem anthro.<br />
<br />
Adam and Scarlet stand at attention. Scarlet was already attractive, but now her figure exaggerated to something indeed out of your fantasies. Adam&#39;s form shifted into it was a replica of Scarlet&#39;s. Red fur covered Scarlet as blue fur covered Adam. Their head morphed into those of foxes, as their feet became digigrated, and a whit tipped furry tail grew from their backsides. Hands became white paws with tiny claws and a thumb. Their hair became a series of braids going down their backs.<br />
<br />
Their clothes vanished, replaced by a chain of large thin golden rings that circled their breasts, went down the centers of their chests, and circled around their hips and shoulders and around their necks. <br />
<br />
Long gold earrings formed on their ears, adorned with jewels of the other&#39;s color. Similar jeweled rings appeared on their fingers and ones on their toes and the base of their tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;-we beg you to come inside Master!&quot; The two echoed in identical voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet and Azure Hinter.<br />
Foxes.<br />
Twin sisters and the first of their Master&#39;s harem. Legally binding as the first of his wives. Ever since meeting him, they knew it was his destiny to rule over all as his  harem, and promised to do everything to help him reach that goal and become the golden kitsune he was destined to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;They have an almost empathetic link with each other, and work together without words. The two have a pathological fear of being separated and  can&#39;t live without each other as almost much as their utter devotion to their Master. Azure is an expert at business while Scarlet is a mistress of logistics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay. Edward KNEW Adam and Scarlet hadn&#39;t been twins. Not even the same age! Edward weren&#39;t sure sure about being first wives, Edward had a childhood crush who Edward was close to who had some odd fetishes of her own and was aiming to make her his &#39;harem queen.&#39; <br />
<br />
You stepped inside, and Scarlet clung to your right side, and Azure to your left. The opened the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see anything on these pages?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Master-&quot; &quot;-they&#39;re blank to us.&quot; they said as they snuggled close to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I told you I created you, this very moment, with all your memories retroactive, from two humans, an old flame and her boy friend who thought I was a freak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then good riddance to them!&quot; &quot;They served a higher calling being remade into us then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t question if I&#39;m joking or gone crazy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know what you tell us is truthful Master.&quot; &quot;And we know you well enough to know if you&#39;ve taken leave of your senses.&quot; &quot;But would you care for us to please you know?&quot; &quot;We can get a blindfold and you can try to guess which of us is which!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, not right now. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our pleasure Master!&quot; They echoed. You saw the house now resembled something from an Arabian fantasy. Every picture showing the twins together with Edward. You wondered who to go after next.</p>
