<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Could we make her into my little sister?&quot; asked Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can do that,&quot; said Lesily, &quot;The question, how little do you want her to be to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy thought about it. &quot;Not too little,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to be able to get along with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know what to do,&quot; said Lesily before going over to the entranced Amanda, &quot;Amanda, how old were you when you had Candy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just a little under 26,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you think that would be a good age for Candy to be the mother of Josh?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
Amanda was quiet for a moment before slowly nodding, &quot;Yes, 26 is old enough to be a mother to a boy Josh&#39;s age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how much older would Candy have to be for that?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;16 years,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind giving her 16 years of age?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
Amanda might have hesitated, by the hypnotist&#39;s power was too strong. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind at all,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now I want you to think of what you were like 16 years ago,&quot; said Lesily, &quot;I want you to become that young woman again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda exhaled as the years left her. The changes were subtle right now, but they were getting more obvious. Her grey hairs were regaining their full color as her wrinkles were fading away. Her muffin top was shrinking as her breasts were regaining their perkiness. The faded tattoos were getting more vibrant while the C-section scar on her stomach became deeper. Even her hairstyle was changing as it regained it&#39;s youthful luster. Gone was short cut of a mother, now replaced with a punky, pixie cut that covered her ears.<br />
<br />
As Amanda&#39;s age hit 25, the young woman winced. Something was happening, her body was racked with pain for a moment as her mind began to fog over. Little by little the c-section scar grew smaller, fainter, until at last vanishing completely as if it had never existed at all.<br />
<br />
Before long, Amanda stopped getting younger. Instead of a fit, motherly figure, she was now a spry young woman. Her tattoos were vibrant again and her stomach was trim and lacking any sign of having a child. Her breasts had shrank down to C cups, but they were still full and perky.<br />
<br />
Lesily spoke to her, &quot;Amanda, how old are you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 19, but I prefer to be called Mandy,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does the name &#39;Candace&#39; mean anything to you?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
Mandy frowned, &quot;It sounds familiar, but I can&#39;t quite place it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; said Lesily before putting her back in a deep trance. She went back over to Candy and said, &quot;Ok, Candy, are you ready to become Daniel&#39;s wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure am,&quot; said Candy excitedly. Her excited expression faded as Lesily put her into a trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Candy, it&#39;s time to start growing older,&quot; said Lesily as her magic went to work. Candy quickly shot up in height. Her baby fat melted away as her features started to become more mature. Her nipples soon stood out before a bra appeared around her growing breasts. Her dress clung to her figure more as started becoming more pronounced. Soon, it became clear she was wearing a party dress. &quot;How old are you now, Candy?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet sixteen and living it up,&quot; said Candy. Her sandals now had heels and her dress clung to her teenaged figure. She was currently a B cup, but that was changing as she aged. As her breasts grew to C cups, her neckline dipped lower to better show off her cleavage. The skirt of her dress lifted higher as it became a minidress to show off her hourglass figures. Her heeled sandals became pumps as Candy became more of a party girl. &quot;18 and ready for adult fun,&quot; boasted Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nice, but let&#39;s start bringing Daniel into the picture,&quot; said Lesily. While Candy continued to mature and bloom, her dress also matured. The skirt fell back down to the floor and her CC breasts were not completely covered up, but more tastefully displayed. Candy&#39;s long ponytail gathered up on itself as it became a bun. The evening gown Candy wore now made her look like she was at a fancy dress party. &quot;So, Candy, how old are you now?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;21, and I prefer Candace, if you please,&quot; said Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think of Daniel?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a really sweet guy that I just met. He&#39;s really cute too. I can definitely see me being in a long-term relationship with him,&quot; said Candace.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you will be,&quot; said Lesily as Candace aged more. Her dress shifted into a maternity dress and her sandy hair was now loose and hanging down to her waist. Her pumps have become more comfortable for her swollen feet. By the general plumpness of her and the way her breasts had swollen up to D cups, she had recently become a mother. &quot;And how old are you now?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;23,&quot; said Candace.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Daniel?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;My loving, wonderful husband,&quot; said Candace.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Josh?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s our new baby,&quot; said Candace proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; said Lesily. Candace aged up three last years. Her maternity dress became a simple house dress. Her plumpness has receded, but her breasts remained D cups. Her feet were back to their regular size, but they were still in comfortable shoes. Over all, Candace looked like a perfect housewife. &quot;So, Candace, tell me about yourself,&quot; said Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 26, I&#39;m married to Daniel, and we have a little boy named Josh,&quot; said Candace.<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you know Mandy?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s my younger sister,&quot; said Candace, &quot;She&#39;s a punk, but she&#39;s got a good heart. I just wish she&#39;d try to look more respectable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily turned to the audience and said, &quot;Well, folks, it looks like Daniel has his wife and the mother of his child. Shall we leave it at that or shall we do some more?&quot;</p>
