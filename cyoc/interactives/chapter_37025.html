<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first sight of the all white farm buildings told both Rachel and Stan that this place, this farm was as a massive institution unto itself.<br />
<br />
A long and curving tree lined paved drive lent a smooth and quiet entrance into a place made and used to dehumanize its subjects to their most vivid and basic animalistic selves.<br />
<br />
As they drove ever closer the scent of horror stuck nanny goats touched the heightened nasal passages in the still changed goatish nose on Stan.<br />
<br />
Stan could tell by the wafting scents as which nanny was fighting her natural instincts more than were those who had since there shipment to the farm, gave in, and became as mindless, unreasoning animals.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked at Stan, &quot;Try to fight those animal inclinations, careful less you become aroused, for once you sport an erection here, the passion will doom you to be as is Micheal.&quot;<br />
<br />
White knuckled and struggling to remain calm and not thinking of leaping a fence and begin random humping of any and every nanny goat in sight; Stan sat shivering, scared that he would give in to the easy bestial delights that are in us all.<br />
<br />
Rachel was not without her own nagging feelings for passion, and as she became uncomfortable, her own sweating and the building of her body to come nearer to having an orgasm, her own scent drifted around and inside the car.<br />
<br />
Maybe a half mile to go before they were to stop the car and get out, then confronting those who worked at the farm for the right to purchase from them Michael; Stan turned to look at Rachel saying to her, &quot;You smell so sleazy and your easy, and sitting there I could become so appeased and pleased!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel had for her intent enough of sexual pleasuring to last her entire lifetime, She pushed Stan away, and again, and grabbing the thick wool on the back of his neck, she jerked his head up and face from trying to orally excite his sister into feeling as did he.<br />
<br />
Begging Rachel, the words spoken by Stan began to slur as his lips took back the shape of those common to a grazing herbivore animal.<br />
<br />
Anxiety and undeniable lusting passion overwhelmed Stan and when his sister would not easily relent to his insisting she let him wallow his face in her groin; he sat up, looking out the car window, and with a scrable of changing hands to become as cloven hooves, Stan opened the car door, and leaped out.<br />
<br />
Scrambling wildly, Stan leaped the fence and ran on all fours, his body rapidly changing as he sought so eagerly to find some horny nanny goat and do to her what likely they both wanted so much of each the other.<br />
<br />
Rachel continued up the driveway, she wanted Micheal back and to save him from his own male sexual inhibitions. <br />
<br />
When she parked her car at what seemed the main managerial building there on the farm, she took a whiff of the strong odor that permeated the air. <br />
<br />
Sweaty and lusty smelling men on the way to becoming goats, donkey, bulls, dogs, and who knew what were still easy for Rachel to pair out and knowingly go toward her most desirable male.<br />
<br />
Greeted as she lighted from the car, the person looking at Rachel could easily see she had spent a fair amount of time being much more the animal than as a human, or at the least since she had visited the Park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, come have we to give up and give in to those wild and woolly bestial inhibitions?&quot; asked the man in a long white coat, his black slacks and shiny polished shoes making him appear as if he were one of the higher up managers there at the farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir, I came here to liberate and buy back my betrothed from living his life as a stud buck male goat.&quot; Rachel said, she turned as did the man when from near to the horse pasture gate they both heard a scuffle.<br />
<br />
Stan, then as much a male buck goat as likely was Michael, stood fighting the wrangler men and their ropes, he having leaped the fence but found himself stuck in the horse pasture and unable at his short height to get any satisfaction from the mares.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex and the passions of it will doom mankind, as I have seen here, those who let go their attachment to living in human realms, find they slip easily down into the bestial way of life, all become as a sexual predator, a ravager of either males or females, and never getting enough to feel sated.&quot; The managerial man said, he speaking rather off the cuff in a way, as what they did to people and making them become as is animals was to better the human race as a whole.<br />
<br />
Stan saw and knew Rachel, he bleating wildly, his long and fully erect maleness swaying and slapping at his shaggy thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, take that one to barn five, put him with not less than thirty nannies recently arrived, he should quell them as they finalize his transition to a buck!&quot; Yelled the man to the wranglers dealing with a angered but aroused male goat named yet as Stan in his changing mind.</p>
