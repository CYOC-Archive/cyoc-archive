<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even as a baby, your powers guided you.  The rope glowed through the haze like a beacon, and for a moment, you thought the rope even slid into your barely grasping hands.  A small tug was all it took to remove the beast from the woman.  In pain, in squirmed on the ground in horror that you still had leverage over it.<br />
<br />
You laughed amusingly at it's squirms and felt yourself grow larger.  Whether it was because of the weakened maiden or through your own powers, you were steadily increasing in age once more.  Your hands became more profound and your fingers lengthened and thinned.   Your chubby arms and legs grew long and muscled once more and your belly grew into abs.   Your hair rained down your face in a most noble way as you gathered your clothes to hide your nudity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps that will teach you a lesson to make better choices in the future!&quot; You remarked just before grimacing at the poor maiden who attempted to bring you down.   Despite her trick, you still felt pity for her.  But either way, for good or for evil, you knew she was going to have to be slain.   You bent down to her, her breasts still heaving slowly, drenched in blood from the werewolf's bite.   With an acute snap of the neck, her body ceased living.<br />
<br />
You turned to the wolf with a most stern-like expression and glared at it with menacing eyes.   The werewolf coward to your appearance and even whimpered softly.  &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; It attempted to bark back at you to regain it's dignity.<br />
<br />
&quot;I spared her your fate of becoming a murderer,&quot; You said, still glaring at the werewolf.  It curled up into a ball, and proceeded to continue it's rest, keeping it's eyes on you with an up most fearful expression.<br />
<br />
A clap from the darkness, as light emerged through the tunnel.  &quot;Well done, mi lord.  You have managed to win this battle without my help,&quot; Angel said.  &quot;You have passed the test, you are ready for Mayella,&quot; she said gingerly and cupped your ragged face.<br />
<br />
You shied away from her and turned back to the corpse of the maiden.  You made the proper burial procedures just outside the cave, leaving no marker for her.   You then turned your attentions on the werewolf, now sleeping.  Opposite from him was Angel, still awake, eying the creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I interrogate him further?  He knows more about Medora than you or I,&quot; You stated calmly.<br />
<br />
Angel looked your way, &quot;Are you saying I am inappropriate to lead you there?&quot; She asked defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not at all.   It's just.  He's been here.  You only have intuition to guide and protect me.  Intuition alone won't save us or complete the task at hand,&quot; You said and for a moment you paused.  You thought of something dreadful, that really hadn't crossed your mind until now.  &quot;What if we fail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then Sarah, Jack, Tom, and Billy will be resigned to their fates,&quot; Angel put simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if it's too late for them?  What if they can't be changed back by the Rainwater of Medora?  What if they want to stay animals and cursed to live a shortened life of beasts,&quot; you said finally, picturing your last encounter of Sarah and Jack as draft horses mating together.  You turned away in disgust from the vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four people were instantly changed into a new lifestyle, far different from their own with absolutely no choice in the matter.  You have been given a quest to not change them back, but to allow them the choice they were denied.   Even Tom... who has mysteriously disappeared and found his way here, may have been altered.   You cannot give up on them now, merely because there is a chance they will not appreciate your courage.   You are the only one who can give them that chance,&quot; Angel said almost without pause, like she had expected you to one day ask her this.   <br />
<br />
&quot;And of me?&quot; You finally said, looking at your hands, an image of hooves flashed in front of your face.<br />
<br />
She laid a confident hand on your shoulder.   &quot;You will be given a choice, as well, to relinquish the powers that fate has allowed you to defeat the Queen.  A certain amount of injustice will always allow fate to tip the scales in favor of justice.   That is the way the world works,&quot; she said and smiled at you.  You felt comfort in her words, as she kissed your forehead and patted your cheek.  You nodded to her and before anymore words could be spoken, you felt yourself trail off into a dream.<br />
<br />

<br />
The next few nights came swift.  You and Angel camped again in the entrance tunnels of the Jagged Mountains of the Tooth.  Each time Ralph transformed, you could not help but to think of your own transformations.   When the wolf was finally complete, it glared at you before swallowing its pride and plopping itself down in mock rest.  &quot;Thats all I seem to do for you people.  Rest rest rest!  I want some ACTION!&quot; The wolf growled.<br />
<br />
You ignored him and turned your way to face the dark of the tunnels.  &quot;Why have no orcs come?  Wouldn't they move at night, being they are evil creatures like our friend here?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
Before Angel could answer Wolf interrupted her, &quot;Evil?&quot;  You looked his way.  &quot;How dare you call us werewolves evil.  We are perfectly akin to goodness and as well as evil like every creature on any world,&quot; The wolf snarled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You ate Sarah's grandmother!  You murdered that maiden!&quot; You argued.  &quot;I'd call that evil!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correction..  you killed that maiden,&quot; the werewolf said.  &quot;With the same reason I killed the grandmother.  To survive, I need fresh meat, and in a city, large creatures are scarce.  I took an old lady, knowing it was her time,&quot; The wolf said humbly.<br />
<br />
You were taken aback by it's correction.  &quot;I killed the maiden because she put me in danger.  Was it Red's time to die as well?  Who are you to make that decision?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please.   You could have spared that maiden, you didn't have to kill her.  You made a decision.  An evil decision.  I killed Red because she saw me.  She tried to defend her grandmother through the cunning use of a spell, but I stopped her in defense.  I had no choice but to eat her as well,&quot; the wolf laughed hideously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Theirs no point in arguing with him.  He is a creature with little choices.  I know you spared the girl of a fate worse than death, there was nothing you could do,&quot; Angel said calmly.<br />
<br />
But still, you were haunted by the werewolf's wisdom.  You plopped yourself down on the hard surface of the cave, again looking into the dark.   &quot;It still doesn't explain why we haven't seen these creatures,&quot; you muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know myself.  You are correct, there is something keeping the creatures away from these entrances, but what?  I cannot say,&quot; Angel said curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's obvious they know you are here.  I could spot you a mile away if I were an ant!  A glowing spirit and a master, are powerful creatures.  If a Queen trembled before your powers, imagine what a lowly orc would think of you,&quot; the wolf spat.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would explain a lot.  How reckless of me not to know that,&quot; Angel frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, you're not meant to know everything.  Besides there could be something else...&quot; You guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I could be right,&quot; The wolf laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; You yelled and silenced the werewolf.</p>
