<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl had thought about his next step. As the new Jeff would do what Carl asked him to do mostly, he could easily send him out to not have any idea of Carl´s next doings. And he didn´t want him to know about either his original nor what he had planned for the twins. Grinning he said: “Say Jeff, could you get me some coke? I don´t want to put my clothes back on right now, and also don´t want to run around in only my boxers.”<br />
Jeff looked apologizing. “I´m sorry Carl, as far as I know we have no coke in the house right now.”<br />
“Perfect” thought Carl before replying: “That´s too bad. You wouldn´t be able to get me some coke from the supermarket then, would you?”<br />
“Yeah, I can do that. Anything else you want?” Jeff accepted easily, already standing up to get going.<br />
“No, nothing I can think off right now. Just send your younger twin-brothers Dan and Sam over here in a few minutes. I want to talk with them. And you won´t need to run, if you are back in half an hour or a bit more it would be good enough for me.” Carl said, still grinning.<br />
“Okay, I will do so. Just need to go to the toilet before I go, I will send the twins up on my way out.” With that, Jeff left his room and headed to the bathroom.<br />
Carl grinned down at his Jeff-boxers. “Now to test you, little cock-sucker boxers.” And just with that, Jeff the boxers started to suck Carl off, much to his shock. “See, I said you would suck me willingly.”<br />
Jeff was disgusted from being wrapped around Carl already, still not understanding how the replacement could believe it was the original. And now he was sucking away on Carl´s cock, and to himself it weird. He had never sucked a cock, and still he did it as if he had much experience. It wasn´t long before Carl cummed into his mouth, and Jeff was horrified how easily he swallowed it. And then his mouth vanished again, with no indication that it had been there or that Carl just cummed.<br />
As the replacement left the bathroom just after Carl had finished, he had no idea what had happened in his room. He headed to his twin-brothers room next. Knocking at the door, Jeff looked in. Dan was at his desk, doing homework, while Sam laid on his bed reading. As both looked up at him, Jeff said: “Dan, Sam, Carl asked if I could send you to him, he wanted to talk with you about something in my room.”<br />
“What was happening over there earlier? You were a bit loud and sounded angry?” Dan asked, slowly standing up after finishing the sentence on his paper.<br />
“Oh, Carl played some prank on me and I didn´t find it funny at first.” Jeff explained, as that was all it was to him now, a prank.<br />
“Okay. How high is the risk he does something similar to us?” Sam asked, already standing beside Dan, ready to move over.<br />
Jeff thought about it for a second. “No, I don´t think he wants to prank you now, too. But I don´t know what he wants to talk with you about.<br />
Nodding to them, Jeff headed out to get Carl his wished coke, while Dan and Sam exchanged a look, shrugging at each other before heading over to Jeff´s room.<br />
As they entered the room, both were surprised that Carl was mostly naked sitting in Jeff´s desk chair. Dan asked: “Hi there, Carl. You wanted to talk with us?”<br />
Sam nodded in greeting before asking: “And why are you mostly naked right now?”<br />
Carl grinned at them, but before he could answer they heard the front-door closing. At their confused looks Carl explained: “I send Jeff to fetch me something, so we can talk without him around. Jeff shouldn´t know you used his masturbation sock yourselves for just that as well, right?” He laughed at their shocked faces. “Oh, and I stripped because I felt like it, and it annoys Jeff.”<br />
After a short pause, Sam asked, unbelieving that someone had found them out: “How did you know we used it?”<br />
Carl grinned wide as he answered: “Oh, I have seen you go into Jeff´s room for some time every so often. And as I´ve used it myself as well, I know someone beside Jeff used it. But it was confirmed by the sock itself when it could talk for itself.”<br />
Both twins had turned red, embarrassed by being found out, then gulped synchronously at hearing Carl had used the sock, too. At the last part, Dan wanted to laugh at something this ridiculous, while Sam just openly gaped disbelievingly.<br />
“The sock, talking for itself? What have you taken to say something that crazy?” Dan finally said laughing out afterwards.<br />
Carl´s grin didn´t diminish, not even a bit. “I took nothing, but Jeff got a computer program that can change things. He made that old sock into a twin for himself, until I changed it back. He said I pranked him, right? I just turned him into underwear for a minute. He was mad at me for doing so, but feared I would wear him. Would you like to test it with yourself? Becoming something else for a minute or two, I mean?” He had already prepared their changes, but it didn´t hurt to ask. And he had a funny first step planned for them as well.<br />
Again, there was a bit of silence before there came a reply. “Why would you think we would want to do something like that, Carl?” Sam asked and Dan added: “And that would also mean we have to believe you first, which we don´t do.”<br />
Carl remained silent for a few seconds, thinking of a fitting answer. “If you don´t believe me, then what difference would it be to say okay, show us? Because if you don´t believe it, there would be nothing happening, so nothing to fear. But okay, if you don´t want to, I won´t force you.” Then he flashed them another grin. That it was a lie that he wouldn´t force them to change was something they didn´t need to know before it happened.<br />
After a minute or more of staring at Carl, Sam finally said sighing: “Good then. Please don´t share that info about us using Jeff´s masturbation sock. I think he would kill us if you do.” Both he and Dan were bright red again in embarrassment of admitting that.<br />
Carl laughed. “I hadn´t planned on it. After all, I would have to admit I did so as well. Another question, if you not use that sock, what do you do? Suck each other off?”<br />
Now both Sam and Dan looked mortified in their embarrassment, putting tomatoes to shame by their faces rich red color. It was answer good enough for Carl, who bursts out laughing loud. Meanwhile Jeff would be the same shade of red as the twins, alone the question was so embarrassing. He still was mentally gagging from sucking Carl off after all. He could feel Carl´s cum inside his not real existent stomach, not really liking that feeling.<br />
“What is so funny about it? We aren´t gay like Jeff or you, Carl.” Dan cursed some more at the still laughing Carl.<br />
After Carl had calmed a bit, he explained his question: “Oh, nothing. But by your faces coloring I guess you do so, even if not gay. And I was just curious, I haven’t a twin-brother after all. So maybe it´s something twins do.” Without turning to the computer, Carl saved the twins changes by hitting enter on the keyboard. “As you have knowledge of sucking each other’s cock, how about that? I will keep it secret, but you have to suck on my toes for a change?”<br />
Both twins looked a mix between mortified and disgusted at that suggestion. “You are a disgusting asshole, Carl. I would never ...” Sam started, only to stop when his body moved towards Carl. Dan had said the first part as well, but stopped after Carl´s name because of his own bodies’ movements, switching sides with his brother.<br />
“What´s happening to …?” Dan exclaimed shocked when both he and Sam dropped to their knees in front of Carl. He was only stopped from asking because his mouth stopped moving wide open, only to close around the big toe of Carl´s right foot.<br />
Carl, still sitting in Jeff´s chair, had raised both of his feet when the twins dropped on their knees, easily putting them in front of their faces. Both looked horrified when they started sucking on Carl´s toes, Dan on the right foot and Sam on the left one. And while they started sucking, their faces changed to absolute disgust and Carl chuckled at them. Without them noticing it, slowly Carl pushed more of his toes into their mouths, as their mouths easily opened sidewards for them. So, Carl´s other toes joined his big ones in their mouths one after another. Only when both twins slowly sucked in more of Carl´s whole feet they took notice. But by then it was far too late for them to escape their fate.<br />
Dan tried to push the chair with Carl away from them, but his arms already started shrinking back into his shoulders, so the chair was out of his reach. Sam tried to dig both his hands and feet into the ground to fight against his sucking mouth, but it also didn´t work. Slowly their strength left their limbs, and that wasn´t only through their shrinking limbs soon couldn´t reach the floor anymore, but also more general getting weaker.<br />
Both Sam and Dan were soon raised into the air by Carl´s feet, all while they still sucked themselves forward on them. Carl grunted a bit, they were much lighter then before, but he still had a bit of weight to lift. At that time neither of them had any limbs visible anymore, and seconds later their hands and feet sunk back into their shoulders and waist, their genitals long gone already. Their own socks and jeans had dropped to the floor, hollow as their bodies shrunk out of them. Not long after their shirts slipped down their shrinking waist and torso as well, leaving them hanging on Carl´s feet naked.<br />
Their mouths by now closed just beneath Carl´s ankles, and they could feel his toes wiggling in their throat, tongues pressed flat by his soles, soon merged into the bottom of their mouths completely. Slowly, as their bodies shrunk further into their necks, their skin-color started to darken, changing from flesh-color to black. Their hair, before the same shade of light brown as Jeff´s, had turned bright red. It sunk into their now black skin, forming a circle of red on their heads. Their blue eyes had also sunken into their faces, growing more sidewards and merged into one bright circle as well.<br />
At the time their mouths reached their destination above Carl´s ankles, filled to the tip where their neck had been by Carl´s feet, a last shudder went through their black bodies, changing them from flesh to cotton. Their lips had become the sock cuffs, below that were a red cotton ring out of their former hair and blue cotton ring, formed out of their eyes. Sam had turned into the left tennis-sock, while Dan was now the fitting right one for the same pair.</p>
