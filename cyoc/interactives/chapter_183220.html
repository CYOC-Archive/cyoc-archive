<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Richard and Alexander just looked wide eyed at their now feminine hands and then back at the mermaids who were looking on with wide smiles. <br />
<br />
“How the fuck do we stop this?” yelled Richard<br />
<br />
“You can’t.” answered a new voice as the two mermaids spun around and looked toward a door they hadn’t noticed before. There standing beside the raised “water” bed was the Dark Lord himself. <br />
<br />
“Master.” Said the Red Mermaid and the Green Mermaid with loyalty in their voices and a deep deep love. <br />
<br />
“Ah…how are my two lovely fishes doing today.” Said the Dark Lord without some warmth but not the same amount of warmth as the two mermaids.<br />
<br />
“Much better now that you are here my Lord.” said the Red Mermaid as the Green one nodded her head in agreement. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for giving us our new sisters.” said the Green Mermaid<br />
<br />
“Of Course, now I need you to do something for me.” said Dark Lord <br />
<br />
“Anything my Lord.” Said the Red Mermaid <br />
<br />
“Well…I want to watch these two men become your sisters.” said the Dark Lord “So please help them along.”<br />
<br />
“With Pleasure.” Stated the Green Mermaid with a happy smile as the Red Mermaid got off her own resting area and dove under the water. The green mermaid did the same.<br />
<br />
For a second Richard looked toward the Dark Lord who was now sitting down as if he was preparing for a show and so he was. Suddenly the two mermaids came out of the water, the water dripping off their bodies making them even more beautiful and alluring. They where on the edge of the pool and looking at Alexander and himself.<br />
<br />
“Come here…..join us?” said the green mermaid in a music like voice.<br />
<br />
“You belong to the Dark Master and the Sea.” song the Red Mermaid in an equally musical voice. <br />
<br />
Beside him Alexander took a step toward the pool, Richard grabbed his arm but he soon found himself going toward the water as well. The mermaids and their beautiful music was luring them toward the water. He was within arms reach of the red mermaid when he suddenly snapped out of it and backed away causing the red mermaid’s face to fall. <br />
<br />
Alexander wasn’t so lucky or maybe from his point of view he was lucky as he got to the edge of the pool and got to his knees. He watched unable to turn away as one mermaid had unbuckled his pants while the other had pulled off his shirt. He got one last look at his friend, he was nude aside from his shoes and his pants around his knees. His member was sticking out at full attention just like his was, his was hurting from how hard it was. <br />
<br />
“Come join us.” Said the Red Mermaid trying to lure him back but he fought it. With more disappointment on her face she turned back to Green Mermaid.<br />
<br />
“Mind if we share?” <br />
<br />
“Of course not.” said the Green Mermaid as she pulled herself out of the water more pulling Alexander into a passionate kiss while the Red Mermaid went down and began to give his friend a blowjob. <br />
<br />
Richard watched transfixed as his friend began to change, his thick black hair began to rapidly grow down his back which he saw was now free of scars from his time at sea. His friend’s moans of pleasure turned from a deep manually moan to a much higher yet softer feminine moan. His friend’s body shifted as well, becoming thinner, while his hips widened, and his ass became heart shaped. The Green mermaid moved from kissing his friend’s face down to sucking on his now growing breasts. He was becoming a woman at lightning speed.<br />
 <br />
Richard turned his gaze to the Dark Lord who had been watching from the other side of the pool, maybe he could attack the dark lord and save himself at least. The Dark Lord someone noticed his gaze and turned and looked at him and he grinned as he pointed at him. <br />
Without him noticing Richard’s hand had moved down to his rock-hard member and he had been pleasuring himself as he watched his friend transform all the while transforming himself but clearly not as fast. He let out a scream which while not totally female was clearly on the way toward being totally female. His body had narrowed and while he still had his strong core it was now softer and feminine. His chest had also exploded outwards into large breasts, larger than either breast of the two mermaids and they kept growing in front of his eyes. He still had his dick but it was tiny but still rock hard.<br />
<br />
Seeing what had become of himself he spun around, long golden blonde hair spinning around as he moved. He began to pound against the door and yelling for help. <br />
<br />
He failed to notice that the moaning had stopped, he failed to notice the sound of approaching footsteps. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt a hand wrapped around him, grabbing him by the hip, the hand brushed over his still growing breasts causing his face to flush. He had only a second before he was spun around and came face to face with a beautiful woman with long silky black hair and deep purple eyes. Her skin was perfect, her breasts while not small sat about equal in size with the red-haired mermaid. She had a long neck, perfect skin aside from a few black and purple scales which sat around her hips and down her legs. <br />
<br />
“Alexander.” said Richard as he realized who this was, his half-transformed friend.<br />
<br />
“I am Alice now.” answered Alexander/Alice in a soft sexy voice as she pressed her nude body against his. One of his hands slipped down and rubbed Richard’s now tiny dick and with one last burst of seaman it slipped within him as he fully transformed into a woman. “Time to join your sisters and serve your master.”</p>
