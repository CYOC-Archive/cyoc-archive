<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s Note: I wrote this chapter as more of a palette cleanser after the intensity of the other branches. If you are reading purely for SPH jack off fiction then this branch might break your wanking momentum. But I do recommend you return when you&#39;ve &quot;Finished&quot; as there might be more SPH down the line. From this branch I&#39;ll only write the consensual kind of SPH.<br />
<br />
Tony scanned Mike on the Chronivac<br />
<br />
Name: Mike Jones<br />
Altered Stats-<br />
Flaccid Length: 1&quot;<br />
Flaccid Girth: 2&quot;<br />
Erect Length: 2.5&quot;<br />
Erect Girth: 3&quot;<br />
Penis Sensitivity: Very High<br />
<br />
He stared at the screen for a moment and saw a button he didn&#39;t notice before &quot;Auto-Fill Average&quot; and pressed it.<br />
Tony paused before hitting apply, putting away the Chronivac and going to sleep...<br />
<br />
The next morning the pair were awoken at dawn by Mike&#39;s alarm. Mike subconsciously reached down to give his cock a rub and found what he thought was his usual soft appendage. Confusion swirled through his groggy brain as he wondered why his flaccid penis was in some kind of hard shell. As he came to, the events of last night came swimming back to his mind and he sat up pulling his sheets down to see a modest sized tent poking up in his pants. In the corner of his eye he saw Tony slowly stirring to consciousness scratching his own new mammoth cock. Mike quickly scrambled to turn his alarm off but Tony was already up and stretching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Tony,&quot; Mike apologized &quot;I usually get up early to work out, forgot to turn off my alarm&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; Tony said &quot;I wanted to get an early start today anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... Thanks by the way. For not leaving me with a micro penis. You didn&#39;t have to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not much&quot; Tony responded  &quot;I think only 5 or 6 inches I didn&#39;t really check...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more than what I deserve... I&#39;m sorry-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Mikey&quot; Tony interrupted &quot;You can stop apologizing, let&#39;s just try to move on yea?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony and Mike crawled out of bed and started to change both facing away from each other. Mike could feel the noticeably loose fabric in the front of his underwear. When they were both dressed they headed down to the dining hall in awkward silence. Half way there Tony spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, sorry about just then in the room&quot; Tony apologized &quot;Is it okay if I call you Mikey?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;*You* can,&quot; Mikey smiled &quot;Just don&#39;t spread it around&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The next few days were awkward for Mike and Tony, despite their history they were like two strangers getting to know each other. Mike, still feeling guilty, was overly pleasing and sycophantic and Tony was always wondering whether or not to return Mike to his full size. After a few weeks they started to relax around each other and actually enjoyed each other&#39;s company.<br />
The two learned a lot about one another they never would have suspected in high school. Mikey was actually a very good writer when he was focusing his creative energy into something other than tormenting Tony. He was pretty funny too once he moved on from his crueler sense of humor. And Tony wasn&#39;t just a computer geek, he was actually pretty good and kicking or tossing the ball around when he wasn&#39;t constantly concerned about having his pants pulled down. Even if he wasn&#39;t in the best of shape, Tony didn&#39;t want to use the Chronivac to &quot;cheat&quot;. He was honest that way. The biggest surprise was a month into term when Mike walked in on Tony getting changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit sorry...&quot; Mikey startled<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, bound to happen some time,&quot; Tony reasoned &quot;don&#39;t worry about it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; paused Mikey &quot;What happened to your cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t we go through this on the first day of College?&quot; Tony teased &quot;You were there Mikey&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Mikey blushed &quot;I mean why is it so... normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well did you expect me to walk around with that monstrosity forever?&quot; Tony smirked &quot;I changed it after a week, I was sick of tearing my undies every time I got a boner&quot;<br />
<br />
Between Mikey&#39;s legs hung a moderate average sized penis probably the exact same proportions as Mikey&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess size isn&#39;t everything&quot; Mikey commented before shucking his own clothes and getting changed, any sense of embarrassment gone between the two.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The next few months went by well, they were liked by the other students on campus and were making good grades. The two began to grow more comfortable around each other. They figured it was okay to jerk off in the room together, everyone does it, it was perfectly healthy. Neither of them had yet to bring back a sexual partner but they did discuss the possibility at one point.<br />
<br />
The two were in their beds both jerking off to their phones.<br />
<br />
Tony spoke up &quot;Hey what&#39;s our system for when we want to bring someone over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Mikey questioned. He looked over at Tony who had his earphones in, and a small bump shifting up and down under his blanket &quot;You got someone in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah just watching a video and they go with the whole sock on the door routine and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What video?&quot; Mikey interrupted, &quot;Link it to me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tony spluttered. &quot;No! Get your own porn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, it can&#39;t be that bad!&quot; Mikey insisted and pulled off his covers and hopped out of bed.<br />
<br />
Tony hurried to put his phone away but his elbow was caught on the wire and accidentally unplugged his earphones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh yea jerk it buddy&quot; rang a male voice from his phone speaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea wank me faster mate mmm&quot; moaned a second distinctly different male voice.<br />
<br />
Tony fumbled around until he managed to turn down the volume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; said Mikey &quot;Umm you know that&#39;s okay with me right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just seeing what it was... I&#39;m not...&quot; Tony defended<br />
<br />
&quot;No... It&#39;s ok, I&#39;d be lying if I hadn&#39;t thought about it&quot; Mikey assured him<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Tony questioned skeptically<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, I mean,&quot; Mikey clarified &quot;Just with you, we could wank each other off at the same time&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why just me?&quot; Tony asked perplexd.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean we wouldn&#39;t be doing anything we weren&#39;t already,&quot; reasoned Mikey &quot;We have the same dick... because of the Chronivac...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea...yea you&#39;re right.&quot; Tony agreed &quot;We could try it...if you want&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey walked over and sat on Tony&#39;s bed. Tony pulled off his covers and scooted over besides his room mate.<br />
<br />
They looked at each other&#39;s dicks, Tony&#39;s looked just a smidgen shorter because he had a little more pubic fat and they had different grooming methods but they were otherwise identical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm you first or me?&quot; hesitated Tony.<br />
<br />
Mikey smiled and yelled &quot;All hands on dick&quot;, quickly grabbing Tony&#39;s cock tight and swaying back and forth pretended he was holding on for dear life.<br />
<br />
Tony snorted before replying sarcastically &quot;Ha ha very funny&quot; and reached over to gently grasp his best friend&#39;s penis.</p>
