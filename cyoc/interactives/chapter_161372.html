<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After several minutes of swimming away from Pleasure Island, Jezebell and Ally finally made it to the shore. <br />
<br />
Jezebell was exhausted. Ally breathed hard as she shook off water from her fur. They almost thought they were gonna drown from exhaustion. Even though they were now donkey, they felt save and good to be back on dry land.<br />
<br />
Now they had to walk towards their town and faced their families in their new form. Several weeks passed by, which helped them get used to their donkey bodies. It had also been the same number of weeks since Jezebell and Ally had spent that fateful night on the island.<br />
<br />
The journey back to town was strenuous. Jezebell and Ally were nervous and tired. <br />
<br />
Stubbornness or not, living as a donkey for those months was not without emotional consequence for Jezebell. The nudity was something that embarrassed Jezebell at first but she’d grown used to it. Not having to worry about what she was going to wear or having people telling her what to wear had felt somewhat liberating. <br />
<br />
But braying was still odd to say the least. Jezebell was however glad she could speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;How am I gonna explain this?&quot; Jezebell asked herself. &quot;What my mom will say? What if she hates me because of what I did and what happened to me?&quot;<br />
Ally thought the same as Jezebell. “I’m scared that my mother won’t like me when she sees what I really am. But, I feel better knowing that she’ll finally know.”<br />
<br />
Jezebell saw some of their hometown’s buildings in the distance. she felt an almost panic level desire to go back.<br />
<br />
“Ally, I’m scared. HEE HAW!,” Jezebell said to Ally in her donkey language.<br />
<br />
“I know Jezebell, I know. But we have to be brave. HEE HAW!” Ally brayed to her.<br />
<br />
Jezebell and Ally soon arrived in town. People were looking at them, most with questioning eyes. <br />
<br />
“I live pretty close to here,” Jezebell brayed.<br />
<br />
The shops and streets looked different somehow. All those weeks as a donkey had afforded Jezebell a new appreciation for living in the town.<br />
<br />
Jezebell remembered that she was starting to think of some donkey things as normal and was losing interest in doing human things. Jezebell knew that if she’d been in Pleasure Island much longer that she might have soon been a donkey on the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll still be friends after this, right?&quot; asked Ally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely yes, we will keep seeing each other.&quot; answered Jezebell.<br />
<br />
“Cool! Maybe your mother can give me a carrot and sugar cube or two. It would be wondeful” Ally said to Jezebell.<br />
<br />
Jezebell laughed, something she hadn’t of done in a long time.<br />
<br />
“Well, we are donkeys,” Ally said.<br />
<br />
The two shared a hearty laugh.<br />
<br />
They walked until they reached Jezebell’s house. It was a small two-story house with two bedrooms. She and her sisters had shared the same room. But maybe the idea of sharing a room with a donkey wouldn’t seem so good to her parents.<br />
<br />
Jezebell stomach tensed up. She feared that she wouldn’t be able to do this.<br />
<br />
“You can do it Jezebell. Your parents will understand,” Ally said.<br />
<br />
Jezebell walked up to her front door. She gulped when her mother opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that? A donkey? What&#39;s doing a donkey in front of the house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee haw!&quot; Jezebell brayed.<br />
<br />
holy crap! I will call animal control.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEE HAW! HEE HAW!&quot; Jezebell brayed again louder.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the mother saw the tears of clothing that the animal was still wearing. They were Jezebell&#39;s clothes. Then she looked at her eyes, despite its equine appearance they looked alike to those of hes missing daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-J-Jezebell?&quot;<br />
<br />
The donkey nodded.<br />
<br />
“Jezebell?!?” her mother asked gain. “Is that really you?”<br />
<br />
The mother jumped at and hugged her daughter. The hug lasted for several minutes as Jezebell allowed weeks of pent up emotion to flow out in the form of tears. <br />
<br />
When they released each other, Jezebell took a couple of steps back.<br />
<br />
“What the hell happened to you?!?”<br />
<br />
Jezebell put her head and ears down of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry that you had to go through that, Jezebell. I wish... I should do something to help you.”<br />
<br />
“Hee Haw!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jezebell’s mother hugged Jezebell again. “Hey girls, come see who’s home,” she said. Then two young girls walked to the door. Their shock when they saw Jezebell was visible. After a difficult explanation, they hugged and there were more then enough tears, thanks and questions for Jezebell about what being a donkey was like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then Ally withdrew from the scene with tears in her muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s time that my mother knows that she raised a jenny&quot;, Ally thought walking back to her home. “Well, it’s okay. It’s not really her fault that I’m a donkey now, I did it to myself. She tried to get me to be a good girl. She warned me of how I was behavin’. I never listened because I was a donkey on the inside and didn’t want to be a good girl.”<br />
<br />
.............................................................................................................................................................<br />
Days later, Ally visited Jezebell while she was given her youngest brother a donkey back ride.<br />
<br />
Ally&#39;s family was happy to have her home again, even if she came home in a strange shape. <br />
<br />
In the end, Ally guessed that her mother was probably happy to have her on home and willing to contribute, even if she was in a donkey form. Ally knew the sorts of jobs girls like her got when they grew up, she didn’t want to end up like that and she doubted her mother wanted it either. <br />
<br />
Jezebell and Ally were in home finally.</p>
