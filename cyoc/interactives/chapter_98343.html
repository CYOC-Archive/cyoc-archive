<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny moved her piece 9 spaces forward onto a dark blue tile. As she moved the piece for the last time the tile glowed dimly in the dark room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Jen! This game has some pretty cool effects!&quot; Abigail stated. &quot;Where did you get it exactly? I want one for myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the blue light intensified and a card appeared in the middle of the game board. Without really knowing what else to do, Jenny picked up the card and started to read it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the card says...this game requires members of both genders. In order to progress, some of you must be reassigned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Abigail was asking. &quot;Do we need some guys in here as well? We could invite some guys from class to join us!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kimberly and Kylie were whispering amongst themselves, giggling a little bit. If Jenny had to guess she would say they were comparing notes as to the cutest boys in class. That would be just like them. Suddenly the card in Jenny&#39;s hand floated away and above the board, slowly rotating but picking up speed. Jenny noticed that as the card spun she could hear a high pitched whine coming from the card. As the card increased its speed the sound increased exponentially. Soon Jenny was wincing from the pain...she couldn&#39;t help it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god my head is going to explode! Make that thing stop!&quot; <br />
<br />
Abigail was having the same issue that Jenny was, she was clutching her head trying to escape the sounds that were assaulting her ears. Strangely enough, Kimberley and Kylie were just looking oddly at the two of them as the high pitched scream continued. The card was spinning so fast it just looked like a blur. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you guys? Why do you look like you&#39;re in pain?&quot; Kylie was asking the two of them...not that they could really hear her.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a blue light exploded from the card, hitting both Abigail and Jenny in their chests and knocking them back, even though they&#39;d already been sitting on the ground. The light faded away quickly, and with it so did the sound of the screeching card. Both Jenny and Abigail uncovered their ears and relaxed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god that&#39;s over, I don&#39;t know what that light was but I&#39;m so glad the sound stopped.&quot; Jenny said. Abigail was nodding while catching her breathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t hear a thing...are you sure you aren&#39;t just making that up?&quot; Kylie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, it was the worst sound ev...&quot; Abigail began, but then her voice gave away and she looked down confused. For some reason she&#39;d been unable to finish her sentence. Her voice seemed to have left her. She tried to cough in order to restore her voice, but it didn&#39;t help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Abi? Do you have something in your throat?&quot; Kylie questioned.<br />
<br />
Jenny too was having issues, although hers were quite different. She was suddenly enraptured by Kylie&#39;s smooth skin and brilliant breasts. She blushed and stared back at Abigail to get her mind off of Kylie when she saw the most unusual thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abi...weren&#39;t your legs shaved a few minutes ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail looked down and gasped, her legs were indeed covered in a fine course of hair. She hadn&#39;t even noticed over the problems with her voice but her legs were definitely hairy. As she watched, it seemed like the hair was growing out faster. Covering her calves and thighs in soft brown hair. Not only that, but she could have almost sworn she noticed her legs seemed more toned. But that was odd, she wasn&#39;t much for exercise. Why would her legs be gaining definition? For that matter why were they suddenly growing hair like crazy!?<br />
<br />
As Abigail was questioning these things, Jenny was having serious issues with her growing attraction to Kylie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Ky...when did you get so hot?&quot; Jenny couldn&#39;t help herself from saying. It was surprising even to her. It felt like something else was coming over her. She just couldn&#39;t help but see those beautiful breasts and Kylie&#39;s gorgeous face. She started to lean in a bit towards Kylie as she felt a haze descend upon her mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny what the heck!? Stop it!&quot; Kylie was pushing Jenny away from her now as she tried to create some space between them. As she did, she noticed that Jenny seemed to be panting slightly. In Jenny&#39;s mind she couldn&#39;t help it...there was suddenly a burning heat emitting from her crotch and she was powerless against it. She HAD to do something to relieve it. There was nothing else rational to do in her mind. Without her original outlet of Kylie she started grinding up against one of the living room chairs. She didn&#39;t know what she was doing, only that it was relieving the heat in her crotch JUST right. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god...it feels soooo good guys...I can&#39;t seem to s..&quot; Jenny started to say, before her voice ended abruptly. Unlike Abigail though, she was much too preoccupied in her activities to worry about it. Meanwhile Abigail was having similar issues to Jenny now. She was lying back on the ground flat breathing heavily and rubbing at her clit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys! Stop it you are freaking us out!&quot; Kimberly was yelling. Kylie had long since retreated to the other side of the room, away from Jenny&#39;s grasp. She was watching everything with horror in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kimberly started to notice something about Jenny. As Jenny continued to hump away at the chair, her clothes were looking more and more tight. The same was happening with Abigail as she continued rubbing away at her crotch. Both were definitely taking on more mass, and Kim could have sworn that Jenny was getting taller as well. Seconds later Kimberly&#39;s suspicions were confirmed when Jenny&#39;s clothes started to rip and tear, suddenly coming apart violently as she continued to madly attack the chair. But suddenly Jenny fell back onto the ground, grasping at her panties with a frantic need, ripping them off as well and starting to rub her clit as well. The thing that took Kimberly by surprise (as much as anything could at this point) was that instead of a vagina as she had expected, there was a small bump on Jenny&#39;s crotch that was expanding fast as she continued to stroke. Suddenly the card&#39;s text began to make since to her, as Abigail was in a similar state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kylie...I think that the game is giving the guys some equal representation.&quot; Kimberly muttered.</p>
