<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The desert moon hung in the sky, a giant mirror shinning down on two groups. <br />
Tamthis' bright red orange fur remained from her vixen form, making the she-<br />
wolf look all the more intense with her crimson eyes. Her platinum blond hair <br />
making hair in the night air added to this effect making her look like some <br />
alluring wolf goddess. <br />
<br />
Alexandra blinked as she shook her head. Sand? What was she doing <br />
outside the castle? Slowing coming back to her senses she looked around in <br />
shock and dismay, where -was- the castle? She remembered her queen <br />
accepting her vow of wishing to serve, and ... being made special... being <br />
made something larger than just herself..but that feeling was gone now, and <br />
she felt rather small. <br />
It was very hard to fully grasp what was happening around her. The castle <br />
was nowhere to be seen but she was far from alone. She saw the master's <br />
concubines standing alongside a strange vixen with just one tail and wings! <br />
She also saw the wolf things, and saw in each of them the features of <br />
someone she knew at her home. <br />
She also saw the odd sight of a four armed she-wolf and a four armed vixen. <br />
But these things all fell away from her brain like leafs in a gail. She saw a <br />
eight tailed she wolf who was equally tall! She also dressed like the queen! <br />
Even this though didn't matter in a couple seconds as she spotted a demure <br />
two tailed vixen wearing the clothes of, <br />
<br />
&quot;Master! What has happen to the Master?!&quot; <br />
<br />
The eight tailed she wolf blinked a red eye at Alexandra. &quot;My dearest prince <br />
wishes me to bring him pleasure, to enjoy me.&quot; The she-wolf temporally <br />
shifted into a massive muscular male wolf whose attire for a second shifted <br />
into something just as revealing and exposing as Karther's own before <br />
becoming again the royally dressed she-wolf. &quot;This is the manner in which <br />
that I shall please him.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made some sense to Alexandra's mind, after all, the prince was known <br />
for being 'creative' in his bedroom endeavors. But, &quot;Where is the castle? Why <br />
have we left it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The intruder has proven much, -much- more dangerous than I imagined. <br />
Absorbing the castle's presence was needed to reclaim my second body.&quot; <br />
She gestured to the almost tail-less vixen with feathered wings. <br />
Alexandra tilted her head, something about the odd vixen's features were <br />
familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;The intruder bears a slight resemblance to your companion Janice my <br />
queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Tamthis' insane mind struggled to remember who that was exactly <br />
before coming up with an answer. &quot;Ah, the old name of my second body. Yes. <br />
But the intruder has taken my second body for it's own.&quot; She spun for <br />
Alexandra and herself. <br />
<br />
Alexandra gasped at this blatantly evil deed.<br />
<br />
Janice groaned listening to Tammy spell out the half-truths and wondering <br />
how many of them Tammy herself believed. Tabra knew better than to try and <br />
convince Alexandra of anything else. After all, Tamthis was Alexandra's <br />
queen, superior only to Karther, who was in no condition anymore to relay -<br />
her- point of view anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me fight alongside you my queen! I am your weapon! Use me as you see <br />
fit!&quot; <br />
Tamthis seemed to consider this for a bit before lifting up the female Karther <br />
and handing her off to Alexandra. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is your task and duty: Take care of our lord and prince as I attend to <br />
these matters.&quot; Tamthis said firmly. <br />
<br />
Alexandra stood at attention. &quot;As you command my queen! I shall protect the <br />
master with my life!&quot; <br />
<br />
Karther merely stood by Alexandra's side, allowing Tamthis to do what <br />
needed to be done. But she looked at her queen longingly, and for him to be <br />
inside her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I burn to be with you my love,&quot; Tamthis said dearly, &quot;But soon we shall be, <br />
and we shall repair the damage done with this unlawful invader!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I puke?&quot; Janice asked calmly. <br />
<br />
Tabra replied in kind. &quot;I'd join you but this body is new, we have nothing to <br />
toss out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do not worry my second body, I shall cure you of talking to yourself, soon you <br />
shall be as you should be.&quot; Tamthis said smiling, she glanced at the <br />
concubines. &quot;All shall.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Over my dead body.' Vicki didn't know about the other former slaves, but she <br />
was prepared to kamikaze herself, if it distracted this, this THING for even a <br />
split second then it had do some good! Luna was already thinking the same <br />
thing, just hoping Barbera was able to take care of the rest of their sisters. She <br />
had seen two of her sisters become those wolves. She wouldn't let it happen <br />
to any of her others. <br />
<br />
The wolves meanwhile were not quite sure what to do with themselves, rather <br />
like Gene. Gene's quickie brainwashing had come to a complete program <br />
freeze, unable to comprehend who her target was. After all, it sensed it's <br />
mistress/master in just about everything around it now. The Shiva vixen <br />
altered mind just wasn't allowed enough freedom to deal with this, thus, it <br />
simply lay on it's knees looking at events dumbly when it awoke, it's swords <br />
were gone anyway, adding it's inability to figure out what it was supposed to <br />
be doing. <br />
<br />
The wolves as a whole meanwhile waited for instruction from their alpha <br />
female on what they were supposed to do next including Robert, Lucy and <br />
Natalie. This was a knife in the gut to Tabra, she had been so sure that once <br />
outside the castle the possession around the transformed wolves would <br />
vanish, but now Tamthis carried the castle within her. Thankfully the <br />
possession wolves had all been absorbed by Tamthis, but sadly this did <br />
nothing for those already changed. Alexandra had been the only member of <br />
Karther's normal staff still under his mind control that had avoided the wolf <br />
things. The rest, guards and maidens alike had been converted in wolves of <br />
their respective genders. It was a rather chilling sight. <br />
<br />
Janice got ready for the fight of her life, there was no turning back now. She <br />
felt Tabra summon up two weapons from their infinite cache. Their arms <br />
raised and Janice felt what they were before she even eyed them. Blade <br />
fans? She felt Tabra charge magical energy into them. Their body twisted <br />
once, and spun around, creating a blinding sand storm, blocking out the <br />
mundane senses of Tamthis, Karther, and their wolf pack. <br />
Then the wind became a gail force! <br />
<br />
Tamthis covered her eyes, she felt Karther shield herself behind her. Good, <br />
her prince was still fine, after all, it was her ultimate goal and purpose for <br />
living to make him/her happy after all. <br />
A slight side effect of Tamthis having eaten the castle, was that she could no <br />
longer use it to tell where her other body was, it was like it had just gone, <br />
through of course Tamthis knew this was impossible. However, because she <br />
had to rely on her mundane senses to pick up the location of her other body, <br />
she prepared herself for an attack from all possible direction. <br />
She waited one moment, then the next, time seemed to stretch on forever, <br />
finally, the wind died down... and they were gone! Her loyal pack of wolves <br />
was still here, as was her third body, but the concubines not yet converted, <br />
and her second body, were all gone! What was this?! <br />
<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Janice heard the faint dripping of water, and the cold air nipping at her un-<br />
furred nose. She unconsciously wrapped her wings around herself, what <br />
happened? <br />
<br />
&quot;I gave us a quick escape.&quot; Tabra said out loud. &quot;Wasn't sure that was going to <br />
work. I haven't used those fans since my last visit to Japan, 1611 in spring <br />
time I think. The sakura sure were nice too look at.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice repeated her question. &quot;Wha-what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fainted. Slept right until morning. I almost keeled over too. I was on <br />
empty. I burned through all my emergency reserves to teleport that many <br />
people at once. It's supposed to be used for only one or two people at once. <br />
So just be glade no one's brains got swapped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute.&quot; Janice said clearing the cotton from their brain. &quot;Are you <br />
saying you... RAN AWAY?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You make it sound like I did it to save our hide. Janice, if we had fought Her <br />
like we were. Worst case scenario we'd have ended up her spare body again. <br />
Best case scenario we'd have been forced to kill her and likely take out half of <br />
Karther's victims in the collateral damage . . . I grabbed who I could and used <br />
up everything we had left to teleport us to one of my safe spots I mentioned <br />
before.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So where exactly are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first try opening our eyes.&quot; Janice started and realized she indeed still <br />
have her eyes closed, when she opened them, she was stunned. <br />
The cave was made of sand, lost of it, but running along in it a short distance <br />
off was a river that started in one spot and flowed off down a tunnel. Why <br />
wasn't it pitch black? She didn't see any lanterns or skylights.<br />
Janice realized the slight glow that was illuminating everything was coming <br />
from her wings. <br />
<br />
Tabra pipped in. &quot;Take a look at my memories, it'll be faster.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice feeling a little apprehensive, did so. She was stunned twice. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're a half-mile underneath the desert surface?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I knew an oasis several miles north that was a safe spot. Even if <br />
Tamthis could still sense us magically, she still couldn't find this spot in a <br />
million years. This underground spring had gone unknown from the human <br />
race since you got kicked out of the garden.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice groaned. &quot;PLEASE don't start that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am what I am. And in a way, so are you now.  This spot hasn't been even <br />
radar scanned for water deposits. We have a chance now to rest, recharge, <br />
and like you've been so adamant about pointing out, customizing some of my <br />
body armor to fit this figure. One of us sleeping it off did wonders for healing <br />
us up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Vicki and the rest?&quot; While Janice had been among the newer <br />
members of Karther's harem, she had had time to learn the names of some of <br />
the girls inbetween... ugh... she shuddered remembering all the different ways <br />
she had entertained Karther. That -thing- inside her, and her rewired and <br />
wrapped brain actually enjoying it! Janice felt ashamed. <br />
<br />
Tabra shuddered too from remembering with her, she could understand why <br />
Janice would rather die than become a pleasure slave again. <br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't you,&quot; Tabra said, &quot;What happened was not your fault in any <br />
way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I me right now?&quot; Janice wondered. <br />
<br />
Tabra hugged herself, and thus, hugged Janice. &quot;If you weren't, you wouldn't <br />
be asking that question.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So where ARE Vicki and.... and...&quot; She meekly said the last two words. &quot;My <br />
sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing wrong with feeling fellowship with them, they've been <br />
through the same thing as you, some much longer than you. The other vixens <br />
are busy collecting their own thoughts, first chance they've had too since they <br />
were de-brainwashed. I took the time to give them the load down on what <br />
happened between us while you were regenerating.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They believed you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After everything they had experienced, and seeing everything go to Chaos, it <br />
wasn't really that far off to their imaginations. They're in another part of the <br />
safe spot. It's a little crowded, this place was meant to hold or two angels. Not <br />
one angel with a roommate, and over half a dozen anthro vixens.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So... where is Tammy, Tammia, Tamthis now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By now she's undoubtedly enjoyed herself with Karther, as the vixen or the <br />
fox I have no idea or the female or female wolf for that matter. She hasn't go <br />
beyond the spot in the desert where the castle was yet. But since she lacks <br />
pretty much even what little self control Karther had, I doubt she'll stay there <br />
for long.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How long will take you... us... to be back up to full strength?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally seven days, but between the two of us, three and a half. Not <br />
counting last night, you were out like a log. But I'm not sure we can really wait <br />
that long. The longer Tamthis is out and about, the more her original self is <br />
more and more buried under the mass of magic, new personalities, and <br />
conflicting essences. Plus, there's a bigger problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice didn't want to know, but had to know. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she picks up where Karther left off, then we'll be in deep deep trouble. My <br />
higher ups won't like it if the middle east ends up being turned into one big <br />
collection of anthro wolves and vixens. And they believe in permanent <br />
solutions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're joking... right? ... Right?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;. . . We were wary of this agreement to begin with.  Karther's entry was <br />
supposed to part of Operation Return.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that was it, that was where Janice drew the line, no thanks, that was it! <br />
&quot;You have GOT to be kidding me!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not -that- return! Geez! Look, a lot of people have been saying that instead of <br />
magic causing less trouble and being more helpful by being behind the <br />
scenes and being in the hands of a few, it was causing more trouble, only <br />
those who abused it had fewer people to answer to. Basically those in charge <br />
of controlling magic realized that prohibition had been one big mistake. So <br />
Karther was going to be a test run to see if we could safely allow magic to <br />
work out in the open, or rather, if it would cause LESS damage.  Karther was <br />
going to be allowed to do his thing on the condition that he didn't kidnap any <br />
ladies who didn't want to knowingly and willing be part of his motif, since he <br />
was a straight pervert they didn't think to include men in the deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need me to tell you that.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously though! Maybe you guys should have just left magic stay in the <br />
back ground!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sunnydale syndrome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sunnydale syndrome is the modern name for it. Basic translation means that <br />
if people see something outside of their range of mental possibility they <br />
pretend they don't see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how does that apply here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When a child's favorite toy is stolen by some child mage whose parents <br />
wouldn't get him one, the child might say what happened but his parents think <br />
he's lying and think that toy was just lost. A lot of the people and things that <br />
vanish are victims of people who have the power and abuse it. Insane artists. <br />
Zoos wanting to skip paying for new animals. Or just some nature preserver <br />
thinking the numbers of humanity are in the surplus. Be VERY happy, since <br />
Karther was technically sponsored by us, you weren't 'covered-up.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like how you said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically it means to keep people happy and ignorant that magic exists you'd <br />
have, along with the other vixens, have been -erased- from the memories of <br />
all who knew you. But here, when everything is said and done, you'll still have <br />
a life to return to if you wish to peruse it, and while your family might not know <br />
your face, they WILL remember you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot; . . .  . how could you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't make the rules. And my main job is just to make sure that people <br />
always remember their have a choice about what they do with themselves. <br />
That's what called me to Karther's castle in the first place, the violation of so <br />
many people's free will just got too loud for me not to hear it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I only got, like, a third of that. But basically you were lifting some out <br />
dated bans, and Karther abused the system?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sums it up. And it wasn't really me. I had little to do with the decision. I'm <br />
hands on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So after we heal up, how can we see to my, sisters?&quot; It was an odd thing for <br />
Janice, she had never had any sisters of her own before, just brothers. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are some remote villages in japan where people still care more about <br />
their beliefs than science. I can give the concubines a free trip to one or two of <br />
them along with a crash language lesson, they'd be treated as sacred spirits if <br />
nothing else. No one would dare harm them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I wouldn't want that. I'd settle just for my species and gender back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And trust me, we're sharing the same body, I can sympathize. Together, we <br />
can repair some of the damage. But I'm an angel of freewill, transmutation <br />
was never my specialty outside of non-living things like our weapons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you call in a 'professional' then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be perfectly honest. They consider stopping a guy whose stock just <br />
crashed from pulling the trigger to be more important than revising the current <br />
state of someone's utterly transient mortal form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I threatened to cut our wrists-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra roared. &quot;YOU WILL NOT FOLLOW THAT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN ANY <br />
SHAPE OR FORM! And we have more important things to worry about than <br />
your STUPID human vanity! Your best friend has gone insane and is <br />
brainwashing innocent people, or did you suddenly forget that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice had had enough of this pompous bible breather. &quot;How dare you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare you!! .... Why... do you human always have to treat Jehovah like <br />
he's some kind of vending machine?&quot; Tabra was sounding dismayed now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other name for God, ya know, the guy whose the big believer in free will and <br />
lets you do stupid things because it's your own choice.&quot; Tabra continued <br />
before Janice could say it, &quot;I know, I know, you think he's just imaginary, go <br />
right ahead, I don't care anymore, seriously. But the fact remains, you and I <br />
are going to sooner or later become one person the longer we stay in this <br />
single body. And unless we want whose left behind we were to be totally <br />
screwed in the head and in no shape to save Tammy, we need to resolve this, <br />
if we keep fighting, it won't do anyone any good.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice thought about it, and weather she liked it or not, Tabra was right. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... &quot; She said the next few words like she was pulling teeth. &quot;I'm sorry. I-didn't <br />
mean to upset you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen so many people ignore every word I said and murder themselves. <br />
You touched a very soft nerve.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra sighed. &quot;That seems to be the answer for everything these days.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Janice stuttered. &quot;I-I promise to stop being such a bitch. But, you can't just ask <br />
me to change what I've believed in my own life at the drop of a hat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don't expect you to. Just understand that what I say is my nature. It's not <br />
meant as an attack against you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice looked at her arms, scratches, she had hurt herself during her shouting <br />
match with Tabra. There a meaning in there somewhere she was sure even if <br />
she didn't get it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the world.&quot; Tabra said in reply to Janice's last thought. <br />
<br />
Instead of snapping back or laying some back handed retort, Janice merely <br />
smiled. &quot;All right. Can we see my sisters now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Works for me. The socialization is bound to help both our sanity's.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then can we get to work on that armor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll guide you through the entire process, you need the practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I do.&quot;</p>
