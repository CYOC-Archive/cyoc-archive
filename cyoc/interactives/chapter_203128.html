<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well?” Loki pressured him, eyes burrowing into his. “Is this what you meant by ‘old you’?”<br />
<br />
Alex kept his mouth closed, too scared of the consequences if he replied. He was young, at least. And he could drink. Loki appeared to have taken his silence as acceptance and was flicking through his phone.<br />
<br />
“Mortals and their toys do have uses. Let’s see what’s going on in the world.” Loki muttered to himself, flicking his finger up and down the screen. He paused. “Oktoberfest. I’ve been gone for a few hundred years, what’s that supposed to be?”<br />
 <br />
Alex realized the question was directed at him. “Um, it’s a celebration in Germany where they drink beer and eat lots of food.”<br />
<br />
Loki nodded absently, clicking on something. “Yeah. Looks like most people attending aren’t very young, though.”<br />
<br />
Sensing danger, Alex spoke up. “You know, plenty of frat houses party then too. Plus, you know, it isn’t even October.”<br />
<br />
Loki smirked. “Says here it actually runs from the middle of September and ends in October. I have one day with you!”<br />
<br />
Alex backed away slowly, realizing that Loki getting into something with such enthusiasm was not a good thing for him. Loki glanced up and flicked a finger his way. Alex found himself held in place by an unknown force.<br />
<br />
“Nope, you don’t get to leave. I have the whole day with you. You wait right there while I do my research. This phone thing is so amazing!” Loki went back to flicking through the information, eyes moving rapidly. “Oh, a parade as well. Boring, I’m sure. Alright, I’m ready.”<br />
<br />
“Great! Let’s put this body to this test.” Alex feigned enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
Loki shook his head. “Nope, that body hasn’t built any tolerance in beer at all. And there’s a beer tasting event I want to attend and you can&#39;t even tell me the difference between a Pilsner and a Lager, can you?”<br />
<br />
Alex went silent, inwardly groaning. Here it comes. <br />
<br />
“That wasn’t rhetorical. Can you tell me the difference?” Loki waited.<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Well, let me ask you again. What’s the difference?” Loki snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
Alex felt a burp rise up his throat. He let it go, just to relieve the building pressure in his stomach. His body rocked slightly and to his horror his new abs disappeared under a layer of flab and his pecs softened a tad. Fit but not athletic. As it did, his mind filled with memories. Going to college, getting into football, getting popular, going to frat parties. Lots and lots of frat parties. Beer of all kinds there. His stomach swelled more as the memories ran through his brain, like he’d gone through life at great speed. <br />
<br />
With each memory settling in, he could feel his belly grow into a round lump, easily concealable under a sweater. Alex felt another burp welling up. He resisted this time, understanding what would happen if he let it out. He struggled, the pressure mounting, before he let the burp out again, louder this time. He remembered eating out constantly, running out of money, being forced to eat at the dining hall. His small belly swelled, growing larger as the memories cemented themselves in his head. <br />
<br />
Freshman fifty, his buddies had joked. His pecs swelled as weightlifting entered his life as this new Alex struggled to get his weight under control. He was no longer slim, but muscular and somewhat overweight though still fit. Even his facial hair had grown, giving him a rather fetching chinstrap beard. A brutish man, fit to be a linebacker. If Alex had placed his body at 21 years old, he could confidently say he was at least 25 now.<br />
<br />
Loki stared at him expectantly and Alex easily rattled off the answer with a confident grin. <br />
<br />
Even a novice like him knew what the difference was, after all. His mind stuttered at the thought, and he realized he’d been changed, though he couldn’t tell how. He couldn’t answer the question last time. What had Loki done?<br />
<br />
“You promised that I’d be a hundred percent me!” Alex protested, though he wasn’t sure if he was even right. Had anything changed?<br />
<br />
“I’ve changed nothing about you, just filled in some memories and life experiences from adulthood.” Loki grinned.<br />
<br />
“Which ones?” Alex demanded, flexing a thick arm threateningly. He was sure something had changed. His college courses?<br />
<br />
 Loki shrugged. <br />
<br />
Alex scratched his furry beergut and blinked. Furry? <br />
<br />
He pulled up his shirt, revealing a large brown treasure trail going up his starter gut and rubbed his hand through them. Had he always been this hairy? He thought he heard another snap and the trail spread across his belly like a wildfire. An itch on his neck and between his shoulder blades had him scratching furiously at the tufts of manfur he’d always had. They’d called him The Grizzly in college ball for a reason, after all. He shook his head, wondering what he’d been confused by.<br />
<br />
Loki whistled. “Hey big guy? Got another question for you. What are the beers served at Oktoberfest called? Can you define their individual flavors?”<br />
<br />
Alex struggled. They were German. But he’d never been to Oktoberfest, he had no idea what they were called. “Not sure man, never tried them. My bros would&#39;ve loved to go.”<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry big bear, you will.” Loki snapped his fingers. “Let’s try the question again.”<br />
<br />
Alex gave Loki a wry smile. Big bear? In his mind, bears were fat. Sure, he&#39;d put on a bit of a gut and he was called a Grizzly back in college but that was because of how hairy he was and that years ago now. Alex’s smile turned upside down. Years?<br />
<br />
Memories came in again. Getting hired at a firm, holding down an office job, embracing the sedentary lifestyle that brought. His little belly began to bloat, years of eating and drinking all kinds of beers filling him up and out, the slight gut growing into a potbelly and then visibly juddering as passed thirty five and his metabolism slowed. <br />
<br />
It wobbled in anticipation, the pressure increasing, swelling with each second as years worth of memories flashed by. Getting into the beer tasting community with the extra money his job provided. Even had his own website. Drinking wasn&#39;t just something to do for fun like in his frat days, he blogged about it. Yeah, this was the life. As he accepted the memories, his belly grew inch by inch. But he had the question Loki posed to think about.<br />
<br />
Alex scratch a hairy pec and shifted in place uncomfortably, too engrossed in answering the question to notice the scratch turned into a grope as the pec softened and drooped into a moob, the areola widening. His outfit changed too, transforming from a form fitting t-shirt and jeans to a dress shirt that stretched itself over his burgeoning belly and tucked itself into a pair of dress pants. A belt twined itself around his widening waist, his love handles sagging over it. It locked itself in place, supporting his belly, which threatened to spill over it and his cellphone appeared at one side in a clip for easy access. His ass and thighs widened, filling out with fat, pushing out behind him.<br />
<br />
The object of Alex’s scratching moved as he pondered the question, up to his face as his chinstrap shifted to a goatee that did nothing to hide the wobbles of the skin beneath as fat filled in, giving him a second chin with a third on the way. His face puffed and widened, the start of wrinkles creasing his cheeks and under his eyes, a gray hair or two peppering his receding hairline. <br />
<br />
He scratched at a forming bald spot that widened and stopped, fingers clenching in cold horror as they met his balding pate. <br />
<br />
A quiet snap came from Loki and new memories of embracing his age hit him. He relaxed then, his formerly trendy hairstyle shaving itself down to something more fitting for an adult, his gut bulging forward and finally lopping over his belt, cheeks sagging lightly into what would be jowls in the future. <br />
<br />
Alex let out a light burp that tasted of the craft beer he’d drank on his way into the forest. He patted his gut and grinned at Loki. He couldn’t trick him now! Alex adjusted his tie and looked confidently at him, years of leading meetings coming to his aid.<br />
<br />
“Of course I know what they are!” Alex rattled off the answer.<br />
<br />
Loki smiled. “Well, Alex, you really got one over on poor little me!”<br />
<br />
Alex swelled with pride, popping a button on his shirt. Of course he’d know what they tasted like! He was a connoisseur. Something about that didn’t seem right, but the clink of the brewskis in his pack confirmed he was still himself. He always brought beer with him on a hike.<br />
<br />
“Good job big bear! But are you sure you’ve never been there?” Loki smirked.<br />
<br />
Alex flushed and tried to hide his pleasure at the nickname. “Nah, I’m pretty sure I’d remember.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to get lost while we’re there,” Loki mused. “But I don’t want you to get too old and not enjoy yourself too. Alright, could you guide me around when we get there?”<br />
<br />
“I really wish I could give you a tour, but I’ve never been there.” Alex hesitated. “Now that I’m thinking about it, we’d need to know German if we’re going to do the beer tasting. And, you know, we’d need to have been there a lot to even qualify as judges. Make connections.”<br />
<br />
Loki shrugged, “If you insist.”<br />
<br />
Alex raised a brow.<br />
<br />
“Final question. sprechen Sie Deutsch?” Loki said. “Waren Sie schon einmal auf dem Oktoberfest?”<br />
<br />
Alex rolled his eyes. “No. And no to the other one, if you were asking what I think.”<br />
<br />
Loki rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers. “Another fifteen then. You should be pretty fluent and have the connections by then.”<br />
<br />
“Fifteen?” Alex’s hair receded back into his head as he spoke. He gave his bare dome a scratch, the remaining hairs at the side of his horseshoe cut going gray. <br />
<br />
Loki walked up to him with a mischievous smile and placed his hand on Alex’s gut. It jiggled forward at his touch, firming up and swelling forward. Alex could use it as a shelf if he wanted, and he had the last time he’d gone to Oktoberfest. A pair of susender straps slipped over his shoulders. Loki snapped them playfully.<br />
<br />
Alex frowned, the wrinkles creasing his face and not uncreasing when Loki started rubbing his ballooning gut. Something was wrong but he couldn&#39;t help but smile, etching the laugh lines and jowls firmly in place. It must&#39;ve been the suspenders. He needed them to hold up his big ol&#39; guts, he wasn&#39;t sure why he&#39;d be concerned.<br />
<br />
“Like that you Ol’ Grizzly?” Loki pulled up Alex&#39;s dress shirt and revealed the beach-ball sized gut, covered in brown hairs that turned gray as Alex watched. He rubbed the overfull gut sensuously.<br />
<br />
Alex nodded slowly, enjoying the relief the rubbing gave him, cock chubbing up. Beer bottles piled up at his feet and the faint taste of beer became heavier on his tongue. The pressure was still building and abated only slightly when his belly button popped out form an innie to an outie at Loki’s gentle rub.<br />
<br />
“Ah, das fühlt sich gut an.” Alex moaned. His goatee grew into a long gray beard that stopped growing when it hit the veritable keg of his belly.<br />
<br />
“There we go big bear, just relax.” Loki nodded encouragingly.<br />
<br />
He was so full of beer. Alex gazed down at Loki, a dopey smile on his face as he rode the buzz, vision slightly blurry before a pair of glasses appeared on his face. He couldn’t imagine life being any better. Drunk in the woods with a cute young man rubbing his belly…Maybe if that sexy twink rubbed a bit lower…<br />
<br />
Instead, Loki reached up and pinched his nipples. Alex nearly cum right there at the jolt of pleasure, not noticing his nipples thicken into the size of erasers.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait to show you around Oktoberfest.” Alex gasped, breathing heavily now. “I know the guys there and we’ve got two seats at the beer tasting event.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds exclusive.” Loki smirked, hand shifting below Alex’s gut.<br />
<br />
“It is, I-Oh! That&#39;s the spot.&quot; Alex moaned, feeling Loki brush the across the tip of his hard dick where it lay buried in his fatpad. &quot;You sure know how to make an old bear happy.” <br />
<br />
“Maybe a little bigger.” Loki whispered and snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
Alex’s buried bratwurst surged out of the fatpad, now the size of a summer sausage. He moaned, staring down at the Twink who now seemed a bit more cub-like, a bit thicker here and there, stubble on his chin. Loki encircled his cock with a fist and began jacking it in Alex&#39;s dress pants. Alex felt his jock strain and shift into a pair of plain tightie whities. A big guy like him didn’t need a jock strap.<br />
<br />
“How old are you?” The red-haired cub whispered mischievously through his chinstrap beard.<br />
<br />
“Fifty.” Alex answered, then hesitated. “Right?”<br />
<br />
“Mmm-hmm, that’s a good number. A ripe vintage.” Loki unzipped Alex’s dress pants and pulled it and his undies to the ground, revealing Alex’s bushy graying pubes and foot-long meatstick. Loki’s tongue licked the precum off the tip of Alex’s dick. “Nice and mature. How you feeling?”<br />
<br />
Loki didn’t wait for an answer, the slightly chubby redhead taking Alex’s turgid cock and deepthroating it. Alex moaned and lay one thick hand on the back of the cub’s head to encourage him, not caring that his arm and hand were covered in thick gray hairs. Even his thick digits had hairs sprouting from them. <br />
<br />
Distantly, he could hear people speaking in German. He glanced up from the best head he&#39;d ever had and saw that they were at the edge of a forest he vaguely recognized and a lovely European city was off in the distance. A parade was happening on main street. A banner declaring Oktoberfest hung there. They were already there? That shouldn’t be possible.<br />
<br />
He tried to resist, mind giving one final attempt to reject this new past Loki had created, but Loki’s tongue flicked along the glans on his cock, stretching a foreskin he never had, the new and unexplored pleasure causing stars to explode in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay big bear.” The now very chubby-verging-on-fat red-furred cub-Loki? Loke? Luke. Definitely Luke-gazed up at him with those alluring blue puppy dog eyes of his that made Alex’s cock jump. “Just accept it. I promise you’ll be happy for the rest of your days.”<br />
<br />
Alex knew something was wrong. Luki...Luke? Must have changed him somehow. He…he couldn’t just accept this, but why wouldn’t he? He had a hot cub in his lap, a ticket to Oktoberfest in his pocket, and a rising orgasm on the way. Alex wasn’t sure why he was scared. Luke’s bobs on his dick became faster-or was his big ol’ paw doing that? He didn&#39;t care either way. Alex felt his orgasm building.<br />
<br />
“Luke I’m gonna.” He gasped and huffed, body jiggling at every motion. &quot;Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke bobbed faster.<br />
<br />
Alex’s toes curled in pleasure. He was…he was gonna…and then, seconds before the orgasm struck, his resistance crumbled. His mind finally relaxed, allowing the memory of his fiftieth birthday party, a birthday that so happened to fall on the first day of Oktoberfest, cement itself in his mind. He’d flown out to Germany and met Luke, the rather chubby redhead that was bobbing on his cock, at the hotel. And now he was out here in the woods living out a fantasy of his he’d had since…well, since he could remember. His body shook as orgasm overtook him, a final layer of chub forming and his body sagging lightly as he fully accepted his life. .<br />
<br />
He came, ropes of cum swallowed up by the eager cub with the most amazing tongue. Alex swore he’d never cum so hard in his life, like he’d been pent up for years. The spurts of cum finally subsided and Loki gave one last lick along his head, cleaning under his foreskin.<br />
<br />
Alex sagged against a tree, smiling happily. The cub leaned in next to him, rubbing against his arm and belly like a cat. Alex swore he could feel his dick stir to life again, which had never happened to him before. <br />
<br />
“You never answered my question. How you feeling old bear?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I&#39;m purring like the kitten that ate the cream.” Alex smiled and closed his eyes. “Very content. 100% normal old Alex.”<br />
<br />
Luke smiled happily, “That’s what I wanted to hear. Glad I could fulfill our agreement so affably.”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded and hummed absently, not sure what agreement Luke was talking about but happy to go to Oktoberfest with a young hottie like him hanging off his rather flabby and hairy elbow. Arm in arm, they descended on the festival, Alex determined to make it a day Luke would never forget.</p>
