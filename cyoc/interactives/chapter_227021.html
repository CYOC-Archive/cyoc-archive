<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Pooding! Pooding!”<br />
The twins chant as they look at their father bringing out some pudding cups that he purchased when he got groceries while they napped earlier. It was the one thing the two white furred wolf cubs were eager to have after supper. Supper consisting of some lemon seasoned chicken with corn nibblets and baby carrots. It was the same as Lucas and Rachael only their portions were larger and had mushrooms; the mushroom were one item that Oliver and Paul found repellent and refused to touch. So when they saw the pudding, the two year old twin cubs squealed with delight with some chocolatey goodness that was going to stain their muzzles as they savage and lick the pudding cups clean.<br />
“It’s easy to incentivize the two,” Lucas chuckling as he tucks into a yogurt cup; noticing the dairy dessert on sale, the wolf fury picked up a few as he always preferred the fruity mixtures to the sugar concoctions that his mate and son’s like.<br />
“Pooding,” Oliver happily squealing as he bangs the now empty pudding cup on his high table, while Paul already has his cup empty aand throws is onto the ground with excitement.<br />
“No more for tonight,” Rachael chuckling as she finishes her butterscotch pudding; “you little savages.”<br />
<br />
“I ran into Lillian Cottontail at the grocery store,” Lucas collecting the empty containers as Rachael starts trying to clean the twins up; “she says Trudy is expecting in a few months and wonders if we are going to find time for some relaxation.”<br />
“Oh I would love a good back rub and a frolic in the hot tub,” Rachael sighing; “but keeping an eye on these two is more of a priority at the moment.”<br />
“Well,” Lucas placing his hand paws on Rachael’s shoulder and massaging them as she struggles to use a napkin to wipe the muzzles of Oliver and Paul clean; “what if we ask Brittany and Jake to watch over them for a while?”<br />
“Our daughter has twins she is barely keeping contained,” Rachael growling as Oliver starts getting fussy from the napkin; “As much as I like to have her spend time bonding with her brother’s, she already has a full plate with Dusk and Dawn.”<br />
“Well those two are older,” Lucas not realizing that his grand cubs are in hot water at the moment; “Perhaps they would like to meet these two hellions.”<br />
“You don’t know do you,” Rachael summoning her phone and passing it to Lucas; “Check our daughter’s texts regarding Dusk and Dawn.”<br />
<br />
Lucas looking bemused, takes the phone and starts looking at the recent messages from Brittany. His smirk soon fades and turns to disappointment as he reads how his grand cubs tried to blow up a garbage can at school. The message was sent while he was at the store; he puts down his mate’s phone and pulls out his to check his messages. He sees the same texts and sighs.<br />
“I thought the flashing runes I was getting were from you,” Lucas putting his phone away; “asking me for your smelly snacks.”<br />
“Did you get them,” Rachael looking at her wolf mate expectantly.<br />
“Not at the store at this time,” Lucas breathing a sigh of relief; “the complex is safe from enduring fish and a fruit that smells like a rotten septic tank.”<br />
“Now that you know our daughter is dealing with our grand cubs for doing something stupid,” Rachael looking at her cubs and resigning the fact that they aren’t going to co-operate any further; “anyone else you think can handle our spirited boys?”<br />
“What about Allison,” Lucas looking at the squirmy wormies as they try to escape their chairs; “surely she can help out. If not her perhaps Edward and Julian,” Lucas tossing out their friends names.<br />
“I’ll send a message,” Rachael picking one cub up while Lucas collects the second; “but don’t expect them to drop everything for tonight.”<br />
“I’m not saying we go to Cottontail&#39;s tonight,” Lucas taking Oliver to the play pen with Rachael following suit with Paul. The two putting the cubs down as they begin to grab toys and proceed to smash them into each other in a makeshift demolition derby. “But perhaps this Saturday evening,” Lucas turning on the television to a local news channel; “we do need an evening too ourselves. That much is clear,” Lucas sitting on the sofa as the weather report starts airing; “you most of all.”<br />
“Well thank you for that,” Rachael sitting next to her mate with a fury arm embracing him as she watches the cubs play with the toys designed to take the beating a toddler would inflict on it; “but let’s just relax for a few hours, maybe watch a movie?”<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
With the cubs tuckered out from play and now in their cribs sleeping; Lucas and Rachael were busy enjoying a private moment for themselves. The thought of an evening at the spa for some relaxation did inspire Lucas to pull out a bottle of peppermint infused massage oil. While he personally didn’t care for the scent, a fact made clear with his lupine nose far more sensitive than his old human proboscis. However this was Rachael’s favorite oil so he managed to suffer through the discomfort as he worked the oil into his mate’s back as she laid down on the bed; moaning softly as Lucas’s hand paws work to undo the knots and relax her muscles.<br />
“Oh that is hitting all the right spots,” Rachael smiling as she sighs in contentment.<br />
“Just you wait,” Lucas slowly working his way down his mate’s back; “soon I’ll hit those spots that only my tool can reach.”<br />
<br />
“Oooooh,” Rachael responds; knowing full well what Lucas was referring too. She was feeling eager to have an end of day romp with her mate; sensing the fur on her crotch and thighs getting wet, Rachael knew she was getting turned on from Lucas’s sensual massage.<br />
“This leg looks all twitchy,” Lucas grinning as he begins to work the oil through the fur, humming as he rubs the thigh and makes his way to the calve muscles. Lucas then repeats the process with the other leg; noting Racheal’s lioness tail thrashing with joyful abandoned. Lucas puts the oil down as he slowly climbs and crawls to be above the prone lioness. He playfully nibbles on one of her fury ears; encouraging her to raise her rump, allowing Lucas to effortlessly slide his hard lupine shaft into her slick entrance.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmmmmm,” Rachael biting down on the pillow as she feels her mate’s knot already invading her entrance as he begins his rhythmic thrusting.<br />
“Ooooooooooo,” Rachael moaning; her body shuddering as the knot finally ties the two together. Lucas’s thrusting getting short and forceful as he gains added leverage by wrapping his arms around her torso and lifting her up slightly. He takes care not to lift her up too much so as not to cause her to gag, just as he makes on final forceful thrust and feels his balls clench as he starts cumming in Rachael.<br />
“Huhuhuhuhuhuhuh,” Rachael muttering; struggling to stay quiet as her orgasm rolls through her from the foreign shaft encouraging her vaginal muscles to clamp down and milk it dry.<br />
<br />
Both bask in their orgasms before Lucas rolls the both of them to the side so as not to crush Rachael while his knot still ties the two together.<br />
“As usual,” Rachael being the first to speak; “that was wonderful.&quot;<br />
“I only hope we can get that Saturday so we could have the real rub and tub,” Lucas absently cupping Rachael’s breasts; some of the peppermint oil was still on his hand paws and he was gently working it into the large warm mamaries. Giving a playful flick of the nipples ensuring Rachael’s orgasm gets extended slightly.<br />
“I sent a text to Edward and Julian a few hours ago,” Rachael responding as she begins to nod off; “but they haven’t responded.”<br />
“Probably asleep by now,” Lucas beginning to yawn; “we’ll check in the morning.”</p>
