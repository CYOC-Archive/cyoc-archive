<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following our second round of orgasms, Kristy and I lay next to each other in her bed, still 
holding each other gently.  As our breathing slowed back to a normal rate, another idea 
popped into my head.  I knew immediately this was something I wasn't going to be able to 
just ignore.  <i>I guess I'll have to forget about going out tonight.</i> I thought to 
myself.  <i>The possibilities here are just too amazing.</i>
<br><br>
"Kristy?" I said, as I looked over at her.
<br><br>
"Yes, Alexis?" she replied with a smile, clearly enjoying the sound of her voice calling me 
by my new name.
<br><br>
"Do you know that it's possible to lactate without getting pregnant?" I asked, though I 
anticipated her answer.
<br><br>
"Of course I know that." she said, rolling her eyes.  "I am a lesbian after all, and I have the 
internet..." she trailed off.  "Wait," she said, as she realized the meaning behind my 
question.
<br><br>
Before she finished her sentence, I was already making my wish.  I had been gently 
cupping my right breast, lightly caressing my sensitive areola with my thumb.  <i>God, 
they are spectacular.</i> I thought to myself.  <i>Now they will be even better.</i>  I 
had always had a lactation fetish, even as my past self.  I guess I just found it to be the 
most feminine thing, and combined with my fascination for breasts, to see them dripping 
with milk was a powerful turn-on.  I spoke the words.
<br><br>
"I wish my breasts would start making milk."
<br><br>
Kristy sat up in bed and turned to face me.  Her look was half of surprise, and half of 
curiosity.  She was clearly also anxious to see the results.
<br><br>
We waited in silence.  It had only been maybe 10 seconds, but it felt like a lot longer.  Not 
much seemed to have changed.  Then, it happened.  My nipples got darker.  I think they 
grew thicker too, as I felt a brief but pleasant tickle.  To accompany this, I started to feel 
something in my breasts that I had never felt in my short time with them.  I felt full.  
That's about the best way I could describe it.  It was a great feeling.
<br><br>
Subconsciously, the hand I had been using to caress my right areola had begun gently 
pinching my now erect nipple.  I turned my attention there, and began deliberately 
squeezing.  I felt a shiver go through my whole body as the first white drop appeared.  I 
was definitely getting off on myself...maybe a little too much.  I looked up at Kristy, who 
was staring back, her mouth open.
<br><br>
"May I?" she said.  I'm not sure whether I wished this or not, but at this point, it didn't 
really matter.
<br><br>
"Yes, help yourself." I replied, motioning toward my left breast, which had begun to ache 
slightly with the pressure of my milk.
<br><br>
A small stream of milk was now running down my right breast and onto my stomach as I 
worked it intently.  I got a little spurt out every time I reached full squeeze, and a few 
drops followed it each time.  God, I was getting myself off.  Kristy's nipple sensitivity wish 
was the best idea ever...until this, of course!  I reached over with my left hand and ran it 
though her hair.  I brushed it back so I could look in her eyes, and she looked back up 
into mine, not taking her attention from my left nipple, which she was now suckling 
hungrily.  I noticed that she was definitely drinking the milk, not just sucking it.  I glanced 
lower and saw that she was also rubbing her clit.  She was so wet!  Her juices had run 
down her wrist and dripped a little onto the bed.
<br><br>
I was just about to reach my peak again.  Kristy's suckling combined with the warm milk 
running down my chest had just put me as close to heaven as I'd ever thought possible.  I 
shuddered as I came.  My whole body tensed.  I think I might have sprayed milk when I 
orgasmed.  Kristy made a small "Mmph!" noise but held on tight.  I arched my back, and 
the warm milk that had pooled in my belly button trickled over my pussy.  I collapsed into 
a wet, sweaty, shivering mess.  I was drained.  Kristy took her mouth from my breast, and 
crawled up to kiss me.  As we kissed, she let me taste my own milk, still in her mouth.  It 
was sweet.  Delicious, actually.  Just how I hoped it would taste.  That must have been part 
of why Kristy was enjoying it so much.
<br><br>
As she began to run her tongue over mine, she suddenly stopped.  She now had two 
fingers in her pussy, and I could feel her rubbing against my leg as she pleasured herself.  
I reached down to cup her firm breasts, then gently pinched both her nipples.
<br><br>
"Oh yes!" she gasped, as she broke off the kiss.  I had pushed her over the edge.  She 
tightly gripped my shoulders as she came for the third time that day.
<br><br>
Kristy rested her head on my chest, still panting softly from her orgasm.  She playfully 
stroked a nipple, and another drop of milk appeared and ran down my breast.
<br><br>
"Ow," I said.  "Stop."
<br><br>
"Sensitive?" she asked, looking up with a smile.
<br><br>
"Yes, very." I said, bearing sort of a silly grin myself.
<br><br>
Kristy rolled over to lay next to me.  "I'll admit," she said. "that was amazing.  I didn't know 
what to think at first, but...wow.  Just wow."
<br><br>
"Yeah."  I replied.  "It felt so good, my own milk coming out of my breasts.  I mean, I have 
this body, but to actually do that, it really made me feel like a woman."
<br><br>
"Oh, shut up." she said.  "You are a woman, and you're staying that way, right?"
<br><br>
"Of course I am.  I replied.  "I've never felt so right as I do now, here with you."  It was true.  
My wonderful new body and my connection with Kristy made me feel better than I had ever 
felt before.  I knew that this was what I wanted in life.
<br><br>
"Well then," said Kristy playfully.  "I have an idea, and it's my turn."
<br><br>
"Oh, what's that?" I replied.
<br><br>
"Well..." she began.
<br><br>
I got the feeling this was going to be a long, but amazing night.</p>
