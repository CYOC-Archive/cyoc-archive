<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ding, Dong rang the doorbell.<br />
<br />
The two boys looked at each other in horror.  Here they were, each with pants with the crotches ripped out, a house that's falling apart.  Not to mention that Dustin's manhood was a couple times bigger than before, hanging between his knees, and that Ty's was about the size of an adult person...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no!  I wish we were ready for someone to be here!&quot; yelled Ty.<br />
<br />
Instantly, it happened.  The house was repaired, and clean.  The boys' cocks were back to their normal sizes and their pants were neatly repaired.<br />
<br />
Ty got up off the basement floor.  &quot;Who do you think it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man!  I forgot!  My girlfriend was coming over today!  We lost track of time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, with Ty's new power, that didn't matter, as they were ready to go.<br />
<br />
The boys ran up to answer the door.  And, sure enough, there was Sandy, Dustin's 20-year old girlfriend.  Sandy was a very attractive girl, about Dustin's height, though she was 3 years older.  She had dark blonde hair, was perfectly built.  Not too skinny, not fat, and a couple of C cups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, love, I'm here.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, baby.  Come on in, we were just getting ready for you,&quot; said Dustin.<br />
<br />
Ty got an idea...  He was getting a lot of fun ideas recently.  He knew that Dustin and Sandy were doing things that Mark and June wouldn't have approved.  Of course, now they weren't here any more.  So, if Ty gave them just a little push and a little privacy, he could have a ball!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I have something in my room I want to show you!&quot; said Dustin, not really sure what he meant.  Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; asked Sandy with a grin.  She had played this game with Dustin in her apartment before, so she knew where it was leading, and she loved it.  Dustin was perfect for her.  That youthful energy...<br />
<br />
So, they walked up to Dustin's room, while Ty stayed behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could see what was going on up there,&quot; thought Ty.  Immediately, as he knew it would, a picture came to mind.  He saw Dustin opening his bedroom door, and the two walking in.  &quot;This'll be great...&quot; thought Ty as he sat back to play concert master.<br />
<br />
As soon as the door was shut, Sandy put her hand on Dustin's chest.  Immediately, she noticed that it felt just a touch stronger than usual, just a touch more defined.  Not freakishly so, just like Dustin had spent some time in the gym between the last time she had seen him and now.  Ty grinned as his first small change took effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, love, what did you want to show me?&quot; Sandy whispered breathily into Dustin's ear.<br />
<br />
He didn't know.  In fact, he wasn't sure why he said it in the first place, but when he looked into Sandy's eyes, he knew what he had to do then.<br />
<br />
He grabbed her gently, and threw her on the bed.  She screamed, delighted at his new strength.  She didn't know that her young boyfriend had that kind of power in his arms.<br />
<br />
In a flash, he was on top of her, kissing her deeply.  It was amazing.  She reached up, and started unbuttoning his shirt.  When she had it unbuttoned, she realized that his pecs were more defined than before.  She was geared up and ready to go.<br />
<br />
Dustin then took his hands up the back of her shirt and unclasped her bra.  He took it out and threw it on the floor.  He then reached up her shirt again, and took hold of those precious twin Cs.  With a small movement of his arms, the buttons of her top popped of, and she laid there, bare-breasted under him.<br />
<br />
This was too much for her.  She rubbed his biceps, which, like his pecs were just a little bigger, and just a little more defined than they had been before.  She ran her hand down his chest, past his abs, and into his pants.  There it was, that 6-inch snake she had grown to love.  He wasn't the biggest guy she'd been with, for sure.  But, he knew how to use what he had, and used it well!<br />
<br />
He went for the button of her jeans, and started undoing them.  In a matter of seconds, she was totally naked, and her hands when to work undoing his pants.<br />
<br />
There they were, fondling one another naked.  Dustin's 6-incher (must smaller than it was just a matter of minutes before) was hard as steel, and the head slipped into her...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah...&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
Ty watched the scene with glee.  Then he really started his magic.<br />
<br />
Just seconds after entry, Dustin started cumming.  Sandy was disappointed.  She knew that normally that meant they were almost done.  But, this time it didn't stop.  He just kept pumping and cumming, pumping and cumming...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, baby, you've got it...&quot; she said between breaths.<br />
<br />
15 minutes passed, and he was still cumming!<br />
<br />
Dustin looked down at his girlfriend.  He was kind of concerned, he'd never cum like this with her before, and he wasn't sure if she could handle it.  She wasn't sure herself.<br />
<br />
But, then she felt a change, and indeed there was one.  Ty added just a little more length and girth to Dustin's penis.  Not much.  Just about a half-inch to each.  Enough to drive Sandy wild.<br />
<br />
Dustin started slowing down, not wanting to wear his girlfriend out.  As soon as she felt him slowing, she looked up at him with a very serious look, &quot;More, baby, more!  I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, Dustin was certainly still enjoying himself, so he kept going...  for another 15 minutes, they made precious love...<br />
<br />
By then, Sandy was getting worn out.  She was amazed at Dustin's new power.  He could last forever!  She was gasping for breath and her heart was racing.  She was in orgasmic ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Dustin was going to stop when he saw how tired Sandy looked.  But, then Ty did just a little more...<br />
<br />
Sandy's breasts were beautiful, they always were.  Dustin loved fondling them, naked, beneath her clothes, whatever, and Sandy loved when he did.  When he looked at them now, still pumping, they looked more voluptuous than ever!  Her C cups looked like they could have been D cups!  (They were, of course).  At this, Dustin had to keep going, and felt Sandy up as he went.  And he was still cumming...  15 more minutes passed...<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, stop...&quot; moaned an exhausted, satisfied Sandy.  They'd been going for 45 minutes now.  Ty felt bad for her, but wanted to see more, but he let Dustin stop, for now.<br />
<br />
Dustin pulled his 6.5&quot; cock out of Sandy, and it stopped cumming.  He collapsed on the bed next to her, not realizing that, as he did, his dick grew another half-inch.<br />
<br />
Sandy looked over at Dustin.  First at his face, those eyes that were piercing and gentle, past that strong chin, the manly pecs, the beautiful youthful abs, to that precious snake, the one she had learned to charm.  When she saw it, she didn't realize it was bigger.  But, she knew she wanted more of it.<br />
<br />
So, she rolled over on top of him, ran her hand down his body as she moved lower, lower, lower...<br />
<br />
Dustin was in ecstasy, Sandy was driving him wild.  Ty was loving the spectacle of the two of them that he got to watch, without them knowing.<br />
<br />
Sandy began massaging the now limp dick, and it started to rise again...  to its full 7&quot; length.  She ran her tongue up it, and stuck the head in her mouth...<br />
<br />
Dustin groaned with delight.  This was the first blow job Sandy had given him!  And it was amazing, feeling that tongue working its way all over his penis, as the lips rubbed against it...<br />
<br />
It was strange, though.  He felt as if it were an orgasm, but he wasn't cumming.  Of course, this meant Sandy could keep going without pausing, and boy did she!  Up, down, up, down.  For 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
After an hour of this sexual escapade, Ty was bored.  He decided to call it to a halt.<br />
<br />
Dustin's dick started going limp, and Sandy started realizing just how tired she was...  So, the two of them, having experienced this little bit of heaven, got up and started dressing.<br />
<br />
They went downstairs, and Dustin gave Sandy a kiss as she walked out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was it?&quot; said Ty from the couch where he had watched the whole thing in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indescribable,&quot; said Dustin as he flopped himself onto the couch beside Ty, his whole body having returned to normal.</p>
