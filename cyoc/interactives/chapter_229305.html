<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan kneeled, prone on the floor of his friends living room with his ass in the air gently swaying forwards and backwards, unable to do much more than moan and pant as the massive intruder relentlessly pounded in and out of him. His ass felt so stretched and wet, he tried to feel anything still, but of course there was nothing there, his shorts were still on but his hole felt so open now, and he could feel something running down his leg.<br />
<br />
Curious Dan managed to bring a hand to the slowly pooling liquid, dipping his fingers in and bringing it to his face, through damp eyes he could see it was clear, smelling it he was confused, he even decided to bring it to his lips, carefully touching his tongue to the sticky clear substance.<br />
<br />
Dan found it sweet and a little sticky, he didn&#39;t hate the taste but was confused, he&#39;d curiously tasted his own precum before and knew thats what this was. But why was it coming from his ass?<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
In the bathroom Chase was still entranced, images and words playing through his mind as he pulled the toy on and off his huge cock, still oblivious to just how large it had gotten. For its credit the toy didnt show and signs of failure, it smoothly slid all the way to his pubes, easily taking his entire length and girth into it self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stretch, ugh... Fuck... Deeper... nngh... Wider... mmm&quot; Chase mumbled and grunted as he mindlessly used the warm and inviting hole of the toy. <br />
<br />
Chases cock had grown massive, he was a good 9 inches before he started with the toy, if he was aware of the difference now his cock would have been at least double its length and much, much thicker, approaching as thick as his arm.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the images and words some new ones flickered, Dan&#39;s face twisted in some kind of pained pleasure, then an ass, Dan&#39;s too? but it had a huge gaped hole, &quot;Mmm so stretched...&quot; Chase mumbled. <br />
<br />
Another word flashed, &#39;Fist&#39; Chase mumbled it too every time he saw it, that word and the new images growning stronger with each passing minute.<br />
<br />
Without thinking Chase brought his hand to the hole of the toy, so each time he slid it back down his fingers would slide in with his fat cock. &quot;Stretch it...&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Dan, somehow was starting to actually enjoy the had fucking he was taking, even moaning on every deep thrust, he could see when he looked down the depth and just how thick the invader was every time it pushed in as his shirt had slid down to his neck.<br />
<br />
Having gotten use to some of the movements and the force, Dan was able to move a little, he was shakey and a little unstable from being on his knees for so long, but he could finally move, he tried to stand but it was still too difficult, so he ended up sitting back on the couch.<br />
<br />
Pulling his shirt over his head and tucking it behind him, he lay there sunk deep into the soft couch trying to catch his breath even as his ass was still being stretched open.<br />
<br />
His shorts were tented with his moderately abover average cock as it had leaked a large wet patch through his shorts, he didnt even want to touch it, he felt exhausted, so much so that he started to doze off.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Chase felt some kind of movement from the toy, this finally waking him from his trance a little. &quot;Huh? I didn&#39;t think I got the motorized one?&quot; he questioned.<br />
<br />
He felt the toys insides move and contract as he slid it all the way onto his huge cock, that making him moan a long breath out, then the movement stopped and gently the inside of the toy somehow felt looser, more relaxed maybe? At that moment Chase slid the toy off his cock almost entirely, it was then he saw just how large his cock was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck!&quot; He moaned, not really surprised just horny, he then started sliding his hand up and down his surprising wet cock slowly stroking his massive length as his tip was still in the toy. As he did this the idea hit him, if his cock was stretching the toy so much maybe he could add his arm too?<br />
<br />
Not really considering if that was even possible for the silicon toy Chase just lined his arm up with his cock and wrapped as much of his hand around his girth as he could, it was difficult he was so thick.<br />
<br />
Chase slowly brought the toy back along his length, when the lips of the opening of the toy met his hand he expected some resistance, but no, the toy just gently opened around his cock and hand, its opening so wet it slid over easily.<br />
<br />
He groaned in pleasure as he pulled the toy along his cock and arm grunting and moaning at the increased pressure on his cock, the somehow tight but also loose and silky smooth hole hugging every inch of what he was putting in it.<br />
<br />
Chase did this for a while, his cock still gently growing longer and thicker, at some point he tried to slide his other arm into the toy too, pressing the toy against the counter as his other hand easily slid in.</p>
