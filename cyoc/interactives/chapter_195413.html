<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Draco had a hard time staying asleep. Between the new sounds and smells he could sense from his wolf body to Susan pulling on his tail while she slept, he had a hard time drifting off. He finally had to turn and face Susan just to fall asleep. <br />
<br />
Come morning, Draco had very little sleep when the sun had come up. His appointment with Susan’s father, Dr. Ericson, wasn’t until 11. This let him sleep in some, at least until Susan woke up. <br />
<br />
“Draco?” She whispered in his ear. “Wake up.” <br />
<br />
“No.” Draco replies, covering his head with his pillow. Susan jumps on to of Draco and straddles him. “Hey, what are you doing?” Draco could feel that Susan didn’t have any panties under her night gown. <br />
<br />
“Waking you up.” Susan says. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have panties.” Draco whispers angerly. “What if I poke up with my thing?” <br />
<br />
“Then I jump off.” Susan replies without a care. <br />
<br />
Draco gently rolls Susan off of him before getting up and stretching. “I didn’t get much sleep late night. You kept pulling my tail.” Draco yawned. <br />
<br />
“Sorry.” Susan replies, blushing. “I was… um… dreaming about the shower yesterday.” <br />
<br />
Draco’s eyes open wide. “You were dreaming about pulling on my thing again.” <br />
<br />
“Sorry.” Susan replied again. “There is just something about it that I like.” <br />
<br />
“Like embarrassing me.” Draco mutters under his breath. <br />
<br />
“No.” Susan answers. <br />
<br />
The two look at each other, not knowing what to say, until they both smell breakfast from downstairs. “Smells like dad is making bacon.” Draco says. <br />
<br />
“Lets go!” Susan replies as she starts running to the door. Draco stops her with his arms. <br />
<br />
“Put so underwear on first.” Draco demands. Susan giggles before grabbing her panties from the side of the bed and placing them on. <br />
<br />
The two kids walked downstairs finding the rest of Draco’s family down there. Susan takes a seat at the table as if she was a normal part of the family. “Hey Susan, Dad told us you were here. Are you giving my little brother a hard time?” Draco’s older brother, Damian says. <br />
<br />
“You can say that.” Susan replies, getting a glare from Draco. <br />
<br />
“Hi Susan, I’m eight now.” Draco’s little sister says as she takes a seat next to Susan. <br />
<br />
“I heard.” Susan replied. “Sorry for missing your party, Laura.” <br />
<br />
“It’s okay.” Laura replied. <br />
<br />
“Draco.” Draco’s father states as he starts plating eggs and bacon for everyone. “Don’t forget we have your annual physical today with Dr. Ericson.” His father then turns to Susan. “You can stay here with Damian and Laura if you like, Susan.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks, Mr. Thompson.” Susan replies. “I’ll get some clothes from my room later.” <br />
<br />
Draco’s mom then walks around and kisses Draco in his furry head. “I am so glad you are now acting more like a hybrid.” She says to Draco. “Though, I will admit, you looked cute in your wolf PJ’s when you wore them. Maybe when it gets colder, and your fur coat isn’t enough at night.” <br />
<br />
Draco ate his breakfast, thinking about how much had changed since he transformed. He was getting used to a new part of his life that he never knew about, but everyone around him apparently new. He also seemed to be the only one affected by whatever changed him, and his reality. <br />
<br />
After breakfast, Draco’s father had him walk Susan back to her house for her clothes via the back yard. Susan grabbed a few days’ worth of clothes and said goodbye to her sister, who was leaving on a trip with some friends before meeting Draco back outside. Draco ran her stuff up to his room before being called by his dad to head to the doctor visit. <br />
<br />
Along the drive, Draco staired out the window. His father could see something was bothering him but didn’t know what to ask. Arriving at the office, Mr. Thompson signed Draco in before a nurse came out to get him. Mr. Thompson gave Draco the choice to go alone or not, and Draco asked to be alone. Walking into the exam room, Draco could hear his father and the office nurse joke about kids growing up. <br />
<br />
The nurse then took some vitals and measurements of Draco, per the exam before leaving the room. Dr. Ericson soon came into the exam room. “Good morning, Mr. Draco. How are you doing today?” He then gave Draco a quick look over. “Did Susan keep you up all night?” <br />
<br />
“She kept pulling my tail.” Draco replies. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that.” Dr. Ericson replies. “But that girl is just crazy about you. Well, lets see. Looking at your chart, you seemed to have grown a lot over the past year. Good for you. have you had any problems you would like to ask about before I get going on your physical?” <br />
<br />
Draco takes in a deep breath before telling Dr. Ericson about what happened at the zoo. He then begged him not to tell his parents. <br />
<br />
“I can see why you don’t want your parents to know.” Dr. Ericson replied. “That would be embarrassing for anyone, even a hybrid. But that is normal for a hybrid for you. There is a good chance you just smelt the female wolfs in heat and it set off your natural mating reflexes.” <br />
Dr. Ericson then remembered his daughter was over with Draco the night before. “Did you and my daughter…?” <br />
<br />
“We did nothing.” Draco quicky answered, a little bit afraid. <br />
<br />
Dr. Ericson smiled. “I didn’t mean to sound like I was getting on to you. It would have been fine if you did. You’re a hybrid. It’s just a father’s reflexes.” Dr. Ericson then walked over and sat down next to Draco. “You are maturing. Sooner or later, you will have to mate. I will give you a book on it before you leave. I will also say something to your father without letting him know about the zoo.” Dr. Ericson then smiled to Draco. “Susan will be there for you too. You two have been friends for years. If you two do something, I will be fine as long as it&#39;s both of your decisions.” <br />
<br />
Draco didn’t quite know what was going on. Dr. Ericson then continued the examination before leaving the room, letting the nurse take some labs and give Draco the book he was talking about. <br />
<br />
After the doctor appointment, Draco’s dad was the one nerves in the car. “Hey, son?” <br />
<br />
“Yes dad?” Draco asks confused. <br />
<br />
Draco’s dad just stayed quiet for a moment before talking. “Just know. We will support you and whatever you do.” <br />
<br />
“Okay?!” Draco replied. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, it’s just wired that both my sons are growing up. You are almost eleven. Your brother is sixteen.” His father said, almost tearfully. <br />
Draco shakes his head before opening the book he was giving. It was a book on puberty, sex, masturbation, and more. Draco learned that what hid did at the zoo and when Susan helped him in the shower was him ejaculating. The book also had information about hybrids and their mating habits, particularly that they could mate at younger ages and with normal humans of the same age. He also learned why Susan was acting so weird, she knew about all of this.  <br />
<br />
Getting back to the house, Draco runs up to his room to read more from the book. As he walks in, Susan slides by before he could close his door. <br />
<br />
“So, how was the appointment?” Susan askes. <br />
<br />
Draco turns and shows her the book. “Have you read this?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Susan replied. “It’s one of the books my dad gives out at his office. I also have read the books he learned from for humans and hybrids.” <br />
<br />
“Was this why you were willing to help me last night?” Draco asks. <br />
<br />
“I’m your friend.” Susan replies. “I will always help you, no matter what it is.” <br />
<br />
“Susan?” Draco asks. “Are you trying to have me mate with you? Is that what you wanted last night? What you were trying to say?” <br />
<br />
Susan looks at Draco, tears forming in her eyes. “Yes.” <br />
<br />
Draco stares back. “I don’t know if I’m ready. This is all too much.” <br />
<br />
Susan walks up and places her hand on the side of Draco’s muzzle. “I’m not saying right now, but I would like it.” <br />
<br />
“What if I change you into a hybrid? Get you pregnant? What…” Draco is silenced by Susan’s other hand touching his chest. <br />
<br />
“I don’t care.” Susan replies. “I just want to be with you.” <br />
<br />
Draco stands there, not sure what to do.</p>
