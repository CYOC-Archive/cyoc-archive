<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up that next morning, way too damn early, to some country music song I didn’t recognize blaring from a nearby cell phone. That was the first indication something wasn’t quite right. I don’t mind country, but I use an old fashioned alarm clock and not a cell phone alarm unless I’m traveling and even then it’s the generic one that comes with the phone. I reached over and saw the big red X on the screen and clicked that until the music stopped. I saw the time on the phone said 3:55am, what the shit? Who gets up this early? <br />
<br />
I really wanted to roll over and just go back to sleep, but two things stopped me from doing that. One, I had a nagging thought in my head that said “You need to go do your chores; clean the stall, check the fences, go get more gas in town for the truck.” And yeah, that was weird enough, since I had very little idea what any of that meant, but somehow I could actually picture it in my mind’s eye. Two, I had a raging hard the likes of which I don’t think I have had since I was a teenager, if even then. My mind kept telling me I needed to get a move on before I get yelled at by my uncle, but my hormones told me to jack off first or I wouldn’t get anything done anyway. The latter won out and I started rubbing my cock under the blanket when I then realized that instead of my soft puffy down comforter I was laying under a wool blanket with some sort of patchwork quilt over it. <br />
<br />
Fully awake now, I started to wonder just what the Hell was going on here. Between the alarm, the weird thoughts of ranch chores, and the odd bed I found myself in – I could tell something major had changed. I thought back to my wish last night, to have a different easier life – had it actually come true? No, that’s not possible is it? Stuff like that doesn’t happen outside of movies, right? I tried one of my favorite lucid dreaming tricks and pictured myself on a nice beach in the sun and willed myself there. Nothing… So this definitely isn’t a dream then… <br />
<br />
I tossed back the covers and saw I was shirtless wearing a pair of gray Fruit of the Loom boxer briefs, with a sizable bulge straining against the fabric. I looked down my body, it was a lean ripped body with wide shoulders and pecs and abs that looked like they were cut from granite covered in a thin layer of light colored hair. My arms too were a good size and very toned, which showed off even more with the distinct farmer’s tan line. My legs, while not massive, were solid, and even laying down in bed, I could see the veins at the surface, much like with my forearms. This was definitely a well taken care of athletic and fit body I woke up in then!<br />
<br />
Returning to my hard on currently throbbing in those briefs, I pulled the waistband down and retrieved my new cock. It was slightly bigger than average, not on the thick side, but a decent length, maybe seven inches or so, and it was cut. At the base I saw I had some reddish blonde pubes now, so I guess I’m a redhead now then? That’s kinda hot – I loved gingers and red heads and now I am one! I was pretty damn turned on by this point, so I started to jack my cock, which was quickly lubed up between my own spit in my hand and the steady stream of precum oozing out from the tip. My  body started burning up and I just felt a massive wave of euphoria wash over me from head to toe – and I hadn’t even orgasmed yet! I started moaning lightly, worried I’d wake my uncle or whoever I live with now but way too horned up to stifle it completely. I reached down with my free hand, sliding it along those eight protruding abdominal muscles until I found my decently sized fabric covered balls. I started to fondle them, as if by instinct, maybe thinking I will shoot more but really just because it felt really good to rub them. Then I slid the underwear down to around my knees, and with my eyes closed kept at it. When my hand returned to those fuzzy orbs, I realized that I didn’t have the normal quantity… There in my hand were three testicles…<br />
<br />
Holy… fucking… SHIT! <br />
<br />
No wonder I was so horned up! This new discovery pushed me over the edge and I couldn’t hold back anymore. My moans got louder and, worried I’d get caught, I grabbed the pillow and used it to muffle the biggest orgasm I’d ever had in my entire life. I couldn’t see the results with the pillow on my face, but I felt a few shots hit my shoulder, and a substantially large pool of cum started to form on my ripped abs. Coming down from the sexual high and getting my breathing back under control, I removed the pillow and looked down at what I had done. It looked like at least a cup of cum was covering my abs, filling in the crevices between each muscle or collecting within my naval. A few streaks were across my chest and I looked over at the pillow and saw it was wet with my handiwork as well. Even behind me on the headboard, there was evidence of my actions. <br />
<br />
As I was relaxing from the bliss, there was a heavy pounding on my bedroom door, “Randy” the gruff man’s voice said, “You need to get a move on if we’re gonna get done before seven. You hear me boy?” “Uh, yes sir.” I said, in a distinctly teenaged voice; manly but not yet fully developed I could tell. “All right then, get yourself cleaned up and be downstairs in ten.” “Yes sir.” I replied. Well shit, it might just take ten minutes to clean up all this mess! <br />
<br />
Finding a dirty tank top in the hamper, I used it as a cum rag and cleaned up everything as best I could. I put together an outfit from what I could find in my closet and dresser. Tight jeans that showed off my athletic ass quite nicely I’d have to say (fuck, I’m getting horned up again already – these more powerful hormones are gonna take some getting used to), a white tee shirt with a thick flannel over it, and some basic white socks. I only found two kinds of shoes, both sized 11; some roughed up work boots and some clean Nike high tops. Figuring the latter wouldn’t be appropriate for ranch chores, I went with the boots. All prepared I stopped by the bathroom to wash my face and in the mirror I saw an amazingly handsome redheaded stud, no older than 20 if I had to guess, looking back at me with deep blue eyes, short shaggy mop of hair with it shaved on the sides, and a model perfect smile. Fuck I was hot! And now my cock is fully hard again, SHIT! I readjusted it as best I could, but the bulge was still distinctly visible in these tight western jeans. So I untucked my shirt in hopes that it would hide it a little. <br />
<br />
“Randy!” I heard who I assume is my uncle shout. “Coming sir!” I replied and ran down the stairs to find him at the front door with a sour look on his face. He was a tall (or at least as tall as I was now so maybe just about six foot) brunette man with a stocky build that was probably once athletic. He wasn’t bad looking, just wasn’t remarkable in any way, or maybe I just wasn’t attracted to him since he is my uncle now. We walked in silence and I followed him to the stables. I don’t know how I knew what to do that morning, but for the next hour I cleaned out the two horse stall. <br />
<br />
My uncle had taken one already and was riding along the fence line clockwise, when I was done cleaning, I took the other horse (I never rode a horse in my life, but somehow it just came naturally) and started riding the other direction looking the fence over. I noted a couple of spots that could use repairs and told my uncle when I caught back up to him on the far end of the ranch. “Good work Randy” he said flatly, “Now go on back and I’ll get the repairs. Grab the list off the fridge for while you’re in town.” I nodded, “Yes sir.” “You gonna hit the gym while you’re there?” I thought about it, sure, why not, might be fun to work out in a body this perfect. “Yes sir.” “Ok, that’s fine, just be back by two, we have some more stuff to take care of I need your help with in the barn.” “Yes sir” I replied and rode back to the house. <br />
<br />
My cell phone showed it was now 6:53am, damn I can’t believe I did all that work this early in the morning, but if I’m being honest, it kinda felt good! Yeah, it’s physical labor, and kinda gross dealing with horse shit, but it beats spreadsheets, pointless conference calls, and inept executives! I went to my room and found a small gym bag. The clothes already in it were fairly funky, so I switched them out for a clean set of gear and tossed those high tops over the top of them. I found his workout supplements in the pantry and prepared some pre-workout and a protein shake. I grabbed the list off of the fridge; looks like a grocery list with some other hardware listed too. Easy enough. <br />
<br />
I found the truck keys hanging from a nail by the back door and headed on into the city, which was a small town about twenty miles away from here. I ain’t ashamed to admit, but during the long drive, I actually jacked off again and almost swerved off the road from the orgasm. I had a dirty sock in the gym bag I missed taking out and used that to clean up the mess afterwards (which thankfully was a smaller mess than the one this morning). <br />
<br />
Shit, it’s gonna take a lot of getting used to, being this damn horned up all the time. How this kid survived high school, I’d really like to know – unless he’s got a bunch of bastard kids running around already or something. Shit I hope not! Well fuck it, I’m a handsome red head, an amazingly fit body, and a healthy sex drive working as a ranch hand on my uncle’s ranch now. I gotta say, this beats the fuck outta doing all that boring paperwork and conference call bull shit!</p>
