<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>We are <b><i>NOT</i></b> going to any chapters about Dory. She is just too closely related to copyrighted material to go into detail without breaking the rule.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Annie was a woman well-known for having fun. There were very few times where a smile wasn&#39;t seen plastered on her face. She was also very energetic so it wasn&#39;t much of a surprise that she became a personal fitness trainer. While she worked with both men and women, a lot of her customers were women. Most people didn&#39;t really suspect anything, assuming women would train better with a woman trainer.<br />
<br />
But little did people suspect that Annie had a very lustful life. She had known she had been into girls ever since her breasts started coming in and had been seeking ways to have sex with other girls since she became legally aged. However, being black was enough trouble for her as it was in the earlier decades. Coming out as a lesbian would almost ensure that she would get lynched someday. And she was aware there were other closeted lesbians who feared to reveal who they were, regardless of race. So Annie became a sort of a haven for women who yearned for the touch of another woman. Of course, Annie made sure not to overstep her boundaries. She didn&#39;t try to sleep with women who were in relationships, even if said relationships were to cover up that they were gay. She had a strict confidentiality with her customers, only speaking about their difference in attraction to someone they may be compatible with. And Annie spend much more time actually training them than playing matchmaker.<br />
<br />
Annie&#39;s secret life lasted for over two decades. Thanks to her own commitment to fitness, she was able to maintain her own body, looking and moving like a woman half her age. But that came to an end thanks to one particular girl. She was pretty young, looking about 19. She said her name was &#39;Jezzie&#39;, though Annie was pretty sure that was a fake name. This hadn&#39;t raised any alarms as she&#39;s had clients who used false names before. &#39;Jezzie&#39; had spoken about her parents who were apparently the strict bible-thumper types. In hindsight, Annie should have noticed the instability in &#39;Jezzie&#39;s&#39; voice as she talked about how long she had repressed her &#39;unnatural&#39; urges. But Annie had been thinking she was helping a young woman who was in conflict about her identity because of an intolerant background.<br />
<br />
It took a few sessions to ease &#39;Jezzie&#39; into the idea of having sex. &#39;Jezzie&#39; had been prickly during those sessions, but Annie had chalked that up to nervousness. The night she did agree to sex, &#39;Jezzie&#39; threw herself in with more passion than Annie had expected. She also seemed to show more experience for someone who had never had another woman touch her before. But the next morning, the terrible truth was revealed. Annie awoke to find &#39;Jezzie&#39; gone and a short letter left on the pillow. &#39;Abominations like us deserve to burn in Hell. We don&#39;t belong in a world where women should only love men. We are a disease to women who should be chaste until they have husbands. So it&#39;s only fitting that the disease I gave you will keep you from luring more women into sin. Your damnation begins now.&#39;<br />
<br />
A trip to the doctor soon confirmed Annie had contracted HIV. To say this shattered her was a very accurate description. Her bright, cheerful spirit had been broken. She soon had to tell her special clients of what happened and how she was no longer safe to have sex with. Of course, her closest friends felt very sorry for her and tried to comfort her. But the betrayal had hit a little too hard. Annie started seeing less and less clients as her passion for working out fizzled. She didn&#39;t let herself go, but her depression became a great concern to her friends.<br />
<br />
Three weeks after &#39;the Destroying Angel&#39; (as Annie&#39;s friends were bitterly calling &#39;Jezzie&#39;) infected Annie, one of her friends decided it was time for a more extreme intervention. She talked to Annie about Animalia and how conversion would cure any disease. Annie had heard about Animalia, but it being purported as a &#39;cure for homosexuality&#39; made her leery. When it was explained that conversion would only make her bi, Annie became more receptive. Before long, she was getting ready to move to Lyre.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Before Annie could get converted, she had to speak with Dr. Jones first. Mostly as an evaluation of her current mental state and where she&#39;d have RHS after her second dose. But to Dr. Jones, the more important worry was Annie&#39;s shaken faith in humanity. &quot;Now, Annie, I&#39;m not going to judge you or your actions,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;I&#39;m just trying to understand as much of your situation as you can. Can you tell me any more about this &#39;Jezzie&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I can, because I don&#39;t know if she was lying or not,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I mean, I think she was being honest about her background, but how could anyone do this kind of thing to people like themselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes, the way a person is raised is too intolerant to consider an alternate point of view. And it&#39;s not uncommon for people to lash out at others because they see their own flaws in them. I might hazard a guess and say this &#39;Jezzie&#39; had been in deep denial about her sexuality for most of her formative years and may have had a bad sexual experience that resulted in her contracting HIV. Since then, she has been on a self-destructive path, seeing herself as a sinner attempting redeem herself,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;But this is only a guess. I would know more before I confirm anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Jones, I&#39;m not wanting revenge,&quot; said Annie, &quot;If anything, I feel more pity than anger towards her. But I think someone needs to find her before she hurts someone worse. Or before she gets herself killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not really something that I have the authority to do,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;But I can contact the proper authorities and tell them to be on the lookout for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want someone to end up like me,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie, I&#39;m going to recommend you only receive one dose,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;I can see that you are still recovering from this emotionally and an adjustment period with only one dose will ease you more into Animalian life. When you&#39;re ready, we can proceed with the second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it going to make such a big difference?&quot; asked Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this hasn&#39;t been proven yet, but a mediated conversion to double-dosed state may improve hormone control and emotional adjustment. Best not to dive in too deep before you can really swim, do you what I mean?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I get that,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I think we can proceed with getting you your first dosage,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Going into one of Horizon Labs&#39; multiple changing room, Annie took some time to look at her reflection one last time. For a black woman who was pushing 60, she was doing amazingly well. It wasn&#39;t just all rolls in the hay at her sessions. Even if the clients who came in for extra reasons needed to work out. But there were still signs that age was catching up. A few wrinkles, a little bagginess in her arms and breasts, hair turning grey at the roots. At least she wasn&#39;t getting liver spots or cataracts. Still, she couldn&#39;t outpace old age forever. It almost made her wish she had more milk than she had now. But an adjustment period was probably better for her.<br />
<br />
As for her choice in animal, Annie found it an easy pick. She always liked zebras and it wasn&#39;t because she was black. They were very stunning creatures and Annie often wore workout tops and that were zebra striped. Though she usually did black with white stripes instead of white with black stripes. It was too bad there were no real zebras with that coloration. But she could at least dress in that patterns. That&#39;ll make a fashion statement with her new skin. Well, there was no sense in waiting longer. Taking the small cup, she drank it down. Didn&#39;t taste a lot different from cow milk in her opinion.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon, Annie felt her skin tingling. Looking at her arms, she saw her dark brown skin being covered over with white and black fur. Her fingertips tingled as they became covered in black keratin. She did feel some discomfort when her feet started changing into hooves. But at least her tail, muzzle, and ears didn&#39;t hurt as they grew out.<br />
<br />
And then it ended, almost too soon for Annie. Taking another look in the mirror, she saw an anthro zebra wearing her clothes. Her breasts and hips did get a bit bigger, but she didn&#39;t get as muscular as she was expecting. She was in great shape already, but she was expecting to get ripped like those female Animalians. Maybe when she was double-dosed. She&#39;ll probably have all the grey out of hair then too. But then again, maybe she could dye white stripes into her hair. But right now, Annie needed to satisfy her reignited need. Pulling up her top and lowering her pants, she started massaging her breast and clitoris. She might just invite a few of her friends to join her here. Not necessarily as zebras, but Animalia might be a better place to stay.</p>
