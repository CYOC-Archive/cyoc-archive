<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you scan the racks of costumes, one catches your eye. It is shiny, black, and looks like it&#39;s made of latex. The whole costume looks like it consists of just a single bodysuit that ends in 4 inch tall high heels, which blend seamlessly with the costume. It also had gloves, a zipper in the crotch, and a set of makeup. It also had a straight, white, back-length wig. Clearly, this was meant for a girl.<br />
<br />
Once you finished examining the costume, you were about to put back on the rack, but decided against it. It&#39;s only a costume, right? And besides, you&#39;ve always been the adventurous type. You take the costume with you into the changing room, and close the door. The assistant glances over at you as you close the door, shaking her head lightly with a knowing smirk on her face.<br />
<br />
You hang the costume on a hook mounted on the wall, and start stripping down. First, you take off your shoes, but once you get one off, the assistant knocks on the changing room door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need this to try on the costume, could you open the door for a moment?&quot; She requests. You open the door, and she hands you a baggy with what looks like pantyhose inside it. Once you have it in your hands, she closes the door for you. <br />
<br />
Curious, you open the bag. The contents of it is a bodysuit that looks like it&#39;s made of pantyhose. The material doesn&#39;t feel like spandex, though. It feels different. <br />
<br />
Putting the bodysuit down beside you on the bench, you continue stripping down. Once your shoes are off, you pull your socks off your feet, then undo your belt, slide you pants down your legs, and step out of them. You take you t-shirt off, and go to put on the pantyhose bodysuit, when a small piece of paper falls out of it. it reads &quot;Wear me naked!&quot; in bold letters. Shrugging, you slip your boxers off, and sit back down on the bench.<br />
<br />
You turn to the bodysuit, and hold it up again. It looks like it would be too small on you, and then on the inside of the neck, there&#39;s a tag. The print is too small to read, but you figure it&#39;s just washing instructions, then a thought crosses your mind. You stretch the neck open, and find, to your surprise, it can open as wide as you need it to. First, you pull it over your legs, expecting it to be difficult with your hairy legs, but surprisingly, it slides right over your skin smoothly. You pull it up to your waist, squishing your groin to the side a little. You pull it over one arm, and then the other. You find it has a hood you weren&#39;t aware of before. Shrugging, you pull it over your head. <br />
<br />
Once it is over your head completely, you feel tingly all over your body, and your vision goes dark temporarily, then you feel like you are wearing nothing at all. Your vision returns quickly, sparing you a brief panic, but you are still confused. You look in the mirror, and you feel a void between your legs. Your gaze darts down to your crotch as you face the mirror. Nothing but flat skin, nothing at all. You reach a hand down to investigate, but momentarily stop. The floor is closer, and the ceiling is farther away, meaning you&#39;ve gotten shorter. Also, your hands and feet are smaller, and your waist is slimmer. Your waist is really skinny actually, like you had a built-in corset. You also notice that your butt is completely flat, but looks a little bit bigger. Did the bodysuit do this to you?<br />
<br />
You reach a hand around to the back of your neck, where the neck and hood meet. When you feel nothing, your stomach does a flip-flop, and your eyes go wide. Then, you feel a sort of pressure on your chest, one that feels like its coming from inside, centered on your nipples. Slowly, your chest pushes out, growing to what you assume to be C-cups. However, you have no nipples, which you find strange. <br />
<br />
Your face then feels like it&#39;s being kneaded. Looking in the mirror, you watch as your face becomes more feminine. Your nose shrinks down some, your chin gets slightly pointier, your jawline becomes softer, your cheeks sink in, Your lips plump a bit, and become the same color as your skin, and your eyebrows disappear. You blink, and look at your face. Something you just now noticed is that you&#39;re bald now. You bring a hand up to your scalp, which feels like the same material the bodysuit was made of. <br />
<br />
You look down at your hand, and see that is has no nails on it. Looking down at your feet, after feeling yourself stand on your tip-toes, you see that you have no toes, or toe nails either. Your &#39;toes&#39; form a point, like stiletto heels. Then it hits you: The bodysuit the assistant gave you is meant for you to be able to fit your costume properly. Knowing this, you feel a bit better about your changes. You tried to breathe a sigh of relief, but no sound came out. Then you notice that you&#39;ve stopped breathing altogether. You shrug, and turn to the costume.<br />
<br />
Pulling the suit off the hook, you open the plastic packaging around the suit, and pull it out. You set it down on the bench, and put the rest of its contents on the bench beside it. First, you reach for the suit. You turn it over, and see a zipper going along the back, stopping just above where your butt would be. You zip it down, and open the suit up.<br />
<br />
First, you slip one leg in, then the other. They both slide in with no resistance. Smiling, you pull it up, and slip one arm in, then the other. Just like your legs, they go in with no resistance. You pull it over your shoulders, and turn around to zip it up, but find no zipper. <br />
<br />
&quot;well that&#39;s strange,&quot; You think to yourself, mouthing it, &quot;Then again, this whole situation is strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look in the mirror, and look yourself over. The suit goes over your breasts, touching your sternum, showing them off. Nipples adorn them, however, they are part of the suit themselves, and not your own. You turn around, and look at your back. The zipper really is gone, and in its place is smooth latex. Your eyes then fall on your butt, still as large, however, it wasn&#39;t flat. It looked like you were wearing a really tight thing, although, you didn&#39;t feel like you were.<br />
<br />
Turning back around, you look down at your crotch, eyes falling on the zipper. You reach down to it, but then something tells you not to unzip it yet. Instead, you look over at the wig and makeup on the bench. <br />
<br />
You walk over to the bench, and grab the wig first. The wig, as you remember it, was straight, back-length, and white. You pull it over your bald head, and feel a tingling in your scalp. You try to remove the wig, but it won&#39;t budge, as if it was your own hair. Then you realize that it has become your hair. Something tells you that you can style it anyway you want to, just by thinking it. You imagine it being hot pink, and calf-length. The hair lengths down to your calves, and turns hot-pink. You feel satisfied with the way your hair is now, and turn back to the bench.<br />
<br />
All that&#39;s left is the makeup. You bend over, but as you reach for it, the makeup floats into the air. The foundation opens up, revealing shiny, jet-black, liquid-latex foundation. A brush dabs some onto itself, and spreads the foundation all over your face. It spreads it on your lips, over your eyelids, and even the back of your neck, until there was no skin to be seen anywhere on your body, only black latex. Next, the eye-shadow opens up, revealing hot pink eye-shadow. <br />
<br />
An eye-shadow brush puts some of the pink powder onto itself, and starts putting eye-shadow on your eyelids. Next, the mascara tube unscrews itself open, and the wand pulls itself out of the tube with a small &quot;pop&quot;. The mascara is hot pink. The wand floats over to your eyelashes, and as it brushes them, it extends them. Once it&#39;s finished, you have fake-looking pink eyelashes. <br />
<br />
Then, a tube of lipstick uncaps itself, and extends the lipstick. It floats over to your lips, and coats it in thick, hot-pink, plumping your lips even more as it does so. You open your mouth, and find the inside of it to be made of a darker, reddish-pink latex. Your tongue is the same color as your lips, but a little bit darker, and your teeth are perfectly white. <br />
<br />
Finally, a contacts container opens up, and out of the saline, a pair of hot-pink contacts levitate. They float over to your eyes, and painlessly put themselves in. You blink your eyes, and on the fourth blink, hear the faint sound of latex rubbing against latex. <br />
<br />
You look at your eyes closer, and find that they have become latex themselves, with no hint of moisture at all. You close your eyes, and rub them, your eye-shadow not rubbing off one bit, and open them again. You poke yourself in the eye, but find it doesn&#39;t hurt. You mouth a sigh, and shake your head, a small smile finding its way on your face.<br />
<br />
Then, you remember that you&#39;ll need to pay for your costume, so you walk over to the pile of clothes in the corner, and pick it up in both arms. You open the door, and walk over to the counter, laying your still warm pile of clothes on the counter as you reach into the back pocket of your pants for your wallet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying your costume so far?&quot; The assistant asks as she types on the keyboard. You nod, wordlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that&#39;ll be $56.50,&quot; The assistant looks over at you. You didn&#39;t notice before, but you were almost at eye-level with the assistant, being only a few inches taller than her. Putting that thought aside, you pull out $60 from your wallet, and she hands you your change, &quot;would you like a bag for your clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, and she walks away from the register, and into a door, then comes out with a grocery bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally, people simply don&#39;t care enough about their old clothes, so that&#39;s why we keep the bags in the back.&quot; The assistant explained. You put your pile of clothes in the bag, and went out of the store, through the mall, and to the parking lot, looking for your car. Once you find it, you walk over to it, get inside, and drive home.</p>
