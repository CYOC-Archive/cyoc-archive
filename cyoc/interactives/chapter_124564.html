<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam looked down at his new body and slumped defeated onto one of the hotel room&#39;s two beds. He felt cheated; sure, he&#39;d considered his dad as a swap candidate, but the fact that the switch practically happened against his will seemed totally unfair. Adam laid down on the bed and stared up at the ceiling.<br />
&quot;This is so unfair,&quot; he whispered to no one. He laid a hand on his stomach, his dad wasn&#39;t a very fat man, but he did have a sizeable paunch, and his frame seemed to be built for bulk. Adam gave his belly a squeeze and a bit of curiosity sparked inside him. He rubbed his stomach slowly and let his hand explore his new frame. He ran his hand over his meaty arms and felt some muscle beneath the crisp white sleeves, moving south he groped his new crotch, it felt full and heavy. He finally stopped after grasping his dad&#39;s thick thighs.<br />
The boy-turned-man sat up, a new tingling sensation filled him and curiosity had nearly replaced his previous disturbance entierly. Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be so terrible. Maybe he could even have some fun. And maybe, just maybe, he could return to his old self.  Or better yet, actually manage to switch bodies with Mr. Bugdale.<br />
Adam felt a jump in his pants at the thought of Mr. Bugdale and decided that if he was going to be in his dad&#39;s body, he might as well get acquainted with it.<br />
He got up and closed the curtains, then he walked up to the vanity mirror that sat over a desk in the corner of the room and got a good look at himself. He&#39;d never noticed it before, but his dad was kind of good looking, and the glases helped push his looks away from flabby and middle-aged and more towards classy and mature. Adam loosened the tie some more and slipped it off, he undid some of the shirt&#39;s buttons and marveled at the way his chest hair peeked out through. He then kicked off his size 10 loafers and wiggled his feet on the carpet. He undid the belt and took off his pants, sighing a breath of relief as his gut slumped forward free of restrains. Now he understood why his dad was always pantsless when he was around the house. Adam finished unbuttoning his shirt and tossed it aside. In the mirror he could see his dad standing in a hotel room wearing nothing but a white undershirt, a pair of old boxers, and black dress socks. His dad had always been rather informal man, and Adam guessed that he must have picked up some of his dad&#39;s traits because he felt incredibly comfortable. He sat down on the chair at the vanity and pulled off his socks, noticing with a smirk the small tufts of hair on his toes before standing back up and pulling his shirt off over his head. He struck a few poses in front of the mirror and chuckled. He liked how his biceps sprung to life when he flexed, and how his belly jiggled when he moved.<br />
Adam ran his fingers through the forest of hair on his entire torso. Hundreds of curly brown hairs spread across his undefined chest, reaching his shoulders, and also across his stomach and tapered into his waistband. His legs were just as furry as his chest, and while his forearms weren&#39;t overwhelmed by hair, they were still noticeably pelted. Adam was urprised at how comfortble he felt in his dad&#39;s body and at how excited he felt exploring it. He gave his ass a squeeze with both hands, really getting a handful of meat.<br />
The bulge in Adam&#39;s boxers was swelling and started demanding more attention. He moved his hand down and groped his package, its warmth filling his entire body. Tucking his fingers into his waistband, Adam&#39;s heartbeat raced as he prepared to make the ultimate reveall. In one swift motion he pulled his boxers down. His father&#39;s dick wasn&#39;t exceptionally long, in fact, Adam thought that his old dick might&#39;ve even been longer, but the member now that hung between his thick legs had girth to spare. And the hefty ballsack beneath it hung low, almost as if to make space for the huge balls they held.<br />
Adam wrapped a hand around his penis, noticing how despite their size, his hands barely made it around the entire thing. He slowly started pumping, noticing how the foreskin peeled away and back, a new experience for the previously circumcised guy. He headed back onto a bed and laid down, never for a moment letting go or pausing his pleasure. As one hand gradually picked up speed as it pumped, the other explored he entierty of his new skin: from the stubble on his cheeks to the hairs on his thighs. Occasioally his hand would wander up to his stomach and give it a squeeze. An almost electric feeling filled his entire frame as his balls swelled with seed. Adam was, as no 16 year old is, a stranger to jacking off, but this felt different.  It felt as if this was his first time, but at the same time as if he&#39;d already done it a thousand times before. Gruff moans and grunts started escaping his lips as he approached climax, he started thrusting his hips as the feeling climbed, completely absorbed in the feeling and in his body. The mattres creaked under his solid frame and his moans got louder, his toes curled with anticipation, and sweat gathered at his forhead as he furiously pumped his thick dick. And like a strike of lighting, waves of pleasure filled him. Hot, white cum shot out and splattered over his chest and stomach.<br />
Adam threw his arms over his head, still panting, a dumb smile on his reddened face.<br />
&quot;That was,&quot; he says between heavy breaths, &quot;amazing!&quot;</p>
