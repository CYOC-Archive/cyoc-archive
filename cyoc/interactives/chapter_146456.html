<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann paced in Katie’s living room as she awaited Jackie’s arrival. Today was the day, she would be meeting Jackie’s parents as their daughter came out to them. This was something Ann hoped would go well, yet she was still worried.<br />
<br />
“You know you should really stop chewing your nails.”<br />
<br />
Ann jumped, startled by the voice. Turning she breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. “Angel you scared the hell out of me,” she said. Jackie smiled as she shyly approached her girlfriend. “Sorry,” she smirked. Looking at her adult girlfriend she stifled a laugh as she gazed at the nervous woman. “You know with the way your acting you would think it was you coming out.”<br />
<br />
“Just nervous,” Ann whispered. “I really haven’t had a chance to meet your parents before. I know from previous experience that my past boyfriends were always nervous meeting my parents.”<br />
<br />
“You’ll be fine,” Jackie said warmly. “Just be yourself.”<br />
<br />
The couple smiled weakly at one another before turning to Gloria and the others. “Thanks for letting us meet here Gloria,” Ann said. Gloria shrugged as she looked at her aunt and her longtime friend. “Don’t mention it,” she said. “Katie’s house is empty for another week or two til she comes home for the summer. Figured you two could use some privacy considering how important this night is going to be.”<br />
<br />
Jackie and Ann nodded as they now looked at one another. “You ready,” Jackie asked. Ann nodded, holding her breath as Jackie now made a wish on her Ring of Age. Stepping back she now watched as Ann took the familiar trip back to her teens. The woman’s features softened while her body became lean as she descended through her 30s and 20s. As she reentered her teens, Jackie watched as her breasts size decreased while her hips contracted ever so slightly. Finally Ann seems to shrink ever so slightly, leaving a skinny blond teen of 15 staring at her. “Okay,” Ann said in a youthful voice. “I’m ready,”<br />
<br />
“Just one more thing darling,” Jackie said as she reached into a bag. “Was hoping you could dress up a bit for the occasion.” Ann now glanced inside the bag smirking at the outfit Jackie had picked out for her. “You have some good taste Angel.”<br />
<br />
Several minutes later Ann emerged from the bathroom wearing a purple long sleeved blouse and a pair of black dress pants. During her regression Jackie had given Ann the gothic hair dye she usually sported at this age. Ann now brushed her purple streaked hair out of her eyes as she smiled at Jackie. “How do I look,” she asked. Jackie smiled, walking towards her girlfriend and giving her a tender kiss on the lips. “Beautiful,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
As the teens now stood outside Jackie’s home they both felt apprehensive. Jackie was worried how her parents would react, while Ann worried about the impression she would make. Taking a deep breath the two teens now slowly walked towards the front door, slowly opening it and stepping inside. “Mom, dad I’m home.”<br />
<br />
Frank and Hannah Fisher now looked up from the couch, smiling at their only daughter. “Hi Jackie,” Hannah said warmly as she stood up from the couch, “Glad your home.” Turning she now looked at the nervous looking goth girl at her side. “This must be your friend Ann,” she said warmly. “Nice to meet you, Jackie can’t stop talking about you. You seem to have made quite the impression.”<br />
<br />
Ann blushed, thanking the woman as her and Jackie now stepped into the living room. Frank Fisher now looked his daughter and Ann over curiously as he put his book down. “Everything alright pumpkin,” he asked. “You look nervous.”<br />
<br />
Jackie took a deep breath as she now gazed at her parents. “Mom, Dad,” she sighed. “Theirs something I need to tell you.”<br />
<br />
“What’s that,” Hannah asked, still slightly confused. Ann looked towards her girlfriend, who gave her a small smile. “Okay here’s the thing,” Jackie said slowly. “You guys already know that me and Ann have been hanging out a lot lately.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t I know it,” Frank chuckled. “I swear Jackie, I had to up the data coverage on the cellphones with the amount of time you spend talking to this girl. That and still trying to adjust to the new looks and music you started listening too.”<br />
<br />
Ann giggled in spite of herself as Jackie blushed. “Sorry dad,” she apologized. Frank shook his head, giving his daughter a warm smile as he settled back into his chair. “It’s okay pumpkin,” he said. “Although you may want to tone it down a bit. Not made of money you know.”<br />
<br />
Jackie now slowly stood, taking a deep breath once more as she looked at her parents. “Yeah me and Ann have grown close,” she said softly. “Closer than you might think.”<br />
<br />
Jackie’s parents gave eachother a concerned look as Hannah now sat down next to her husband. Whatever was troubling their daughter now had them worried. “What’s wrong,” Hannah asked. <br />
<br />
“I’m,” Jackie stammered. “I’m bisexual mom and dad. Ann..is my girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Hannah and Frank say in silence, their jaws hanging slightly open as they stared at their daughter. Frank turned a critical eye toward Ann as she shrank back slightly. “I see,” he said softly rubbing his eyes. “So, you like guys and girls.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure,” Hannah whispered, causing Ann and Jackie to give her a confounded look. “Yes mom I’m sure,”Jackie groaned, slightly embarrassed. Hannah apoligized softly as she now turned towards her husband. “Frank are you alright?”<br />
<br />
Frank nodded as he took a deep breath and slowly stood. Jackie felt fearful as her father approached her. As he stared down at her she felt herself break into a cold sweat. Reaching down Frank now pulled Jackie to her feet, squeezing her tightly as he patted her back, “Okay,” he said softly. “I’m glad you told me.”<br />
<br />
“Your okay with this dad,” Jackie asked, her eyes dampening slightly as she looked into the warm expression on her fathers face. “Your still my daughter Jackie,” he shrugged. “My concern at the end of the day is your happiness. Which begs the question are you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jackie stammered. “Yeah dad, I’m very happy.” Frank smiled as he looked towards his wife. Hannah now stood, a shocked look on her face as she approached her daughter. Gently kissing Jackie on the head before hugging her tightly. “I’ll admit I’m shocked,” she whispered. “But, I want  you to be happy Jackie. No matter what your father and I love you.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Jackie sniffed as she hugged her parents tightly. “I was worried you would be mad.”<br />
<br />
“Have you done anything stupid,” Frank asked, narrowing her eyes. Jackie shook her head no. “Then no Im not mad,” As he gazed down at Ann her furrowed his brow placing his hands on his hips authoritatively. “Now you on the other hand,” he said, causing Ann to gulp. “You and I need to talk. You better treat my daughter right”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir,” Ann gulped. <br />
<br />
“I’m serious,” he said sternly. “Jackie’s my only child. I trust her but you and your family need to make a heck of an impression if I’m going to allow you to date.”<br />
<br />
“Family,” Jackie and Ann said in unison.<br />
<br />
“That’s right family,” Frank said. “Ann tonight you and I are going to get to know eachother. You seem like a nice girl and obviously Jackienthinks the world of you. Still, young people can sometimes fall for the wrong person. I want to make sure you have Jackie’s best interest at heart.” Ann could only nod as Jackie’s parents now sat down to talk with the young couple.<br />
<br />
After an hour of what Ann would only describe as an interrogation, Frank and Hannah smiled, hugging the teenage Ann tightly. “I like you Ann,” Frank smiled. “I may not get your fashion sense but you do have a good head on your shoulders.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you Mr. Fisher,” Ann blushed.<br />
<br />
“I agree with your father on this one Jackie,” Hannah said warmly. “Ann seems like a very level headed girl and quite mature for her age.” Jackie stifled a giggle as she and Ann exchanged knowing looks. “So it’s okay if me and Ann date?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see why not,” Frank said. “But first, I’d like to sit down with Ann’s parents.”<br />
<br />
“My parents,” Ann stammered, a lump forming in her throat. Frank and Hannah nodded as they looked the teenage couple over. “Yes dear your parents,” Hannah said softly. “When Mr. Fisher and I had Jackie we told ourselves that when Jackie became old enough to date that we would want to meet the family. Considering the...unique nature of your relationship, we want to make sure that the two of you have strong support. Just in case something goes wrong.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean by support,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
“Relationships are never easy,” Frank said. “Even the best ones take work and while I do like you Ann I want to make sure your family is solid. I’m well aware that..Well.....the type of relationships you two are in can be viewed, negatively.”<br />
<br />
“We do support you two though,” Hannah said quickly. “But we do know that people that come from troubled homes can cause trouble. We would hate to see Jackie ruin her life or for Ann to get in trouble.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not going to happen,” Jackie exclaimed, as she was about to say something else, Ann grabbed her arm, giving her girlfriend a small smile. “Jackie,” she said quickly. “Look your folks are right. I’m get what their saying, they don’t want anything bad to happen to you their just looking out for your best interest.”<br />
<br />
“But..”<br />
<br />
“No buts,” Ann said. “Trust me on this. Parents always want what’s best for their kids. Yeah, I made a good impression but they want to know more about me before they get comfortable with the idea of their daughter dating.”<br />
<br />
Jackie frowned before sighing, one of the advantages of having a grown down girlfriend is that they could see things from an adult perspective, Jackie, being only 15, couldn’t see that her parents request was done out of love and support. They had no problem with Jackie and Ann dating, they just wanted to make sure that nothing bad could derail her future.<br />
<br />
After meeting with Jackie’s parents Ann and Jackie now found themselves standing on Jackie’s porch. “So that went well,” Ann smiled. Jackie shot her girlfriend a grumpy look. “Yeah right,” she huffed. “I can’t believe my folks will only let us date if they meet your parents.”<br />
<br />
“It’s the grown up thing to do,” Ann smirked. “Besides, younfolks are totally okay with us dating. You were so worried about them accepting the relationship and now your upset because they do but are overprotective.”<br />
<br />
“Okay Your right,” Jackie sighed. “But now they got to meet your parents. How the hell is that going to work?”<br />
<br />
Ann sighed as she now looked at her girlfriend. Bringing her real parents into this equation was a non starter, the two would have to come up with something. “That Jackie,” she said, “is the million dollar question.”</p>
