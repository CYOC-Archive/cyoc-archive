<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You grip the trident in your hands, feeling the power surge in its staff. You raise the trident above your head and it starts to glow in a golden light. The water in the pool starts to swirl and soon goes strong enough to create a whirlpool inside the pool. The whirlpool grows into a small cyclone and it picks you and the mermaids up into the air. The cyclone carries you all to the ocean, where it dissipates and each of you dive into the water.<br />
<br />
The seven of you regroup once deep enough into the ocean. The six of them line up and swim in formation as if awaiting commands. The one on the end closest to you speaks up. &quot;Well done, Milord. Excellent use of the trident. As King, you must use it to protect and serve your new people.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes, one of my new responsibilities.&quot; You gesture for her to come forth.&quot;Now, you mentioned before the purpose for human males to be turned. Could you explain that again?&quot; She bows. &quot;Of course Milord. Due to the humans&#39; pollution in our environment our sea-born mermen are not able to produce children. Our population is dwindling rapidly so we have been forced to transform human males for breeding purposes. The trident chose you and led us to you, naming you the future mate to our Queen.&quot; You circle the young mermaid with your hands and trident behind your back. &quot;So I am to mate only with the Queen? Seems unproductive to the cause.&quot; The young mermaid takes her sight off the horizon and relaxes a little, her eyes following your movements around her. &quot;While you will be mated to the Queen, Milord, you are expected to sire children with many mermaids. The children conceived through those unions will not be able to lay claim to you as the ones produced by yourself and the Queen will.&quot; She finishes her brief, but then adds something extra that one might be abe to call flirting. &quot;Of course, Milord, it will also be considered a great honor for any young mermaid to carry the child of such a prominent speciman of a merman as yourself.&quot; The other mermaids collectively gasp at their sister&#39;s bold words.<br />
<br />
You stop swmiming and face this bold mermaid. &quot;An honor for any mermaid you say?&quot; &quot;Of course, Milord.&quot; &quot;Hmm. What is your name?&quot; She straightens herself up and pushes out her chest. &quot;I am Frela. Captain mermaid of this squad.&quot; You swim up to Frela and look down onto her. Your new height lets you tower over her and you can properly appreciate her ample cleavage almost pouring out of her breastplate. She starts to shake as she knows she&#39;s being judged. &quot;Captain Frela. You have donw me a great service transforming me into my true form and teaching me of my new role as King. Therefore, I have decided that you shall be my first conquest. What say you?&quot; She squeals and turns to her squad who are equally excited and jealous. You cough and everyone snaps back into attention. Frela speaks &quot;Whatever you desire, Milord.&quot; You nod and focus on your trident. In a flash of golden light, it disappears, but you know you&#39;ll be able to summon it at any time. You swim behind a rock formation to wait for Frela while she hands off her breastplate to her second-in-command. She rounds the corner to where you wait, revealing that underneath her armor she wore a simple gray bikini top that did very little hold back her full 34-DD breasts. She swims up next to you and bows her head. &quot;Thank you for this, Milord. It is a great honor to serve you. But if I am to be honest, I have never done this before...&quot; You shut her up by holding her face in your hands. &quot;I&#39;ve never been a merman before. But let&#39;s just do what comes naturally okay?&quot; You pull her into a kiss. After the two of you swim around for a while intertwined, Frela starts to lower herself to line up your sheath to her entryway. You pull Frela back up to your face  &quot;We&#39;re not done yet, Frela.&quot; &quot;But Milord, the purpose of this is to mate. Why the delay?&quot; &quot;Because that not how this merman has sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
You go back to kissing Frela. Your mouths disconnect as you move your kisses down to her neck where you suck and bite her skin for a while. &quot;Oh Milord&quot; she moans and smiling, you move down to her collarbone. Reaching around her back, you undo the bottom string to her top and turn it around her neck, exposing her large floating breasts. You continue to kiss down to her chest till you reach her areolas. You grab onto her butt and hold her body against yours. &quot;Milord, what are do-ooo-ooo...&quot; she doesn&#39;t get to finish as you put your mouth over her nipple and start sucking. You swirl your tongue around in a frenzy and bite down causin Frela to cry out in pleasure. You do the same to the other breast while fondling the freshly played one with your hand. After that you can&#39;take the waiting any more -- seeing this beautiful mermaid roll her head back and cry out in pleasure is driving to the edge. So you break away from her tingling rack go back up to her juicy lips. With one hand still on her ass, you hold her and press her back into the stone wall of a nearby formation. &quot;Now&quot; you whisper to her and you float up and press your hands onto the wall, lining yourself up with her. Your engorged dick starts to slide out of its sheath and seeing it Frela exclaims &quot;Oh Milord! I have never seen one so large before!&quot; and wraps her arms around your waist to hold on. &quot;Being Mer King has its perks.&quot; You shove your dick into her awaiting merpussy and both of you wince from the building heat and pleasure. As if the tightness of her vagina wasn&#39;t intoxicating enough, with each thrust and pump it clamps down harder onto you. You both grind your tails into each other, slapping her tail into the stone wall over and over, creating small cracks around her back side and your hands on the wall. Soon you pick up enough speed and both climax. You spray your incredibly fertile seed into her tender insides at an enormous pressure you had never experienced before as a human. You both float there against the rock for a moment as you try to catch your breath. After a few minutes, your dick goes limp and retteats back into your tail&#39;s sheath. Your semen is still pouring out of her tail, but you are sure it got the job done.<br />
<br />
You lean down to give Frela one last kiss as she reties and readjusts her top. Putting your hands on her large breasts for one last squeeze, you tell her &quot;Thank you Frela. You did an excellent job and now I am sure your womb is already settling in it&#39;s new occupants.&quot; &quot;Thank you, Milord. This will be an experience I will treasure for the rest of my life. My children will be proud to know their father is the King.&quot; &quot;And Frela, you being my first, when we arrive at the Palace I would like for you to become my personal servant. If only temporary, so that I may observe your progress. And maybe to call upon you again when the time is right.&quot; Her eyes widen and mouth drops open. &quot;Why yes, Milord. Whatever pleases you.&quot; She bows and swims back around the rock to her sisters in arms. I stay behind to give them a moment when I hear their squealing and storytelling. Looks like mermaids, under their formal exteriors, are not so different from human girls.<br />
<br />
After about five minutes, you swim around the rock to where the mermaids are still chatting about Frela&#39;s encounter. One mermaid has her hand patting Frela&#39;s stomach when I cough to alert them of my presence. They all straighten up and get in formation as Frela swims forward and pauses at attention. &quot;Milord, what would you like to do next?&quot;</p>
