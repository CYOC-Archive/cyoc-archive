<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt wasn&#39;t a particularly ostentatious guy so he decided to become a simple tank top for his first transformation. Despite his desires he was pretty nervous so figured that something straightforward would be a good idea to start with. That plus Matt was a pretty slutty guy by nature, so the thought of being a piece of skimpy clothing designed to show off a hot guy&#39;s physique was rather appealing to him.<br />
<br />
Scrolling down the options he decided to set the transformation duration to an hour, though he kinda hoped someone would come by and claim him he also thought he&#39;d give himself an out so that he should be able to turn back rather quickly if needed. Damn, his caution and his filthy desires were really causing some internal conflict here...<br />
<br />
Dismissing that and turning back to the Chronivac, he started customising his future form a bit. He set his tanktop body as a plain white tanktop that would be a Small size, his cock twitching as he thought of himself pulled tightly across a muscled torso. He was sure to check the &#39;Aware&#39; box, there wasn&#39;t any point of transforming himself if he couldn&#39;t feel the pleasure of being an object, and ensured that he&#39;d have all his senses while transformed plus giving himself a gradual transformation. He wanted to savour this.<br />
<br />
After checking that everything was as he wanted it he gulped and clicked &#39;Confirm&#39;. &#39;No turning back now&#39; he thought as he backed away from the computer. Already feeling a little faint he realised that the change must be starting and rushed over to his mirror to observe. He tore off his clothes so he&#39;d get a better view of what was happening to him, noticing as he stripped that his already pale skin was starting to turn even more white.<br />
<br />
He stared at his nude reflection in the mirror, his clothes in a heap next to his whitening feet. He noticed his cock standing erect, probably harder than it had ever been, and decided to give it some attention. As he grabbed it he felt a white heat spread through his body and he moaned in pleasure, but through the sensations he could feel his cock diminishing beneath his hand. Part of his mind told him that he should be concerned by this, but the sensations it caused along with the knowledge that he was becoming less of a man and more of an object made him too excited to care.<br />
<br />
Matt moaned with pleasure, but as he tried to close his mouth he found that it was locked open and gradually shifting to a circular shape. Surprisingly having his mouth forced open wasn&#39;t uncomfortable in the slightest, in fact it felt entirely natural to him. He tentatively felt around his mouth-hole with a finger, expecting it to be somewhat numb, but found it as sensitive to the touch as his dickhead.<br />
<br />
He buckled and fell to his knees, at first he thought it was the sensation he was feeling overwhelming him but then he felt his legs beginning to melt away beneath him. The changes seemed to be starting with his feet and it was incredibly bizarre feeling them hollowing out and deforming, before shrinking away into nothingness. The change gradually crept up his shins, Matt felt them hollowing out into tubes of fabric so it felt like he had two empty socks attached to his legs, before they too vanished and he felt nothing at all there.<br />
<br />
Matt was too wrapped up in his excitement about changing to feel the weakness in his knees, only noticing as they gave way beneath him and he fell flat on his face. He groaned as he felt his diminished cock and balls rub against the hard floor, then felt his balls tighten and he shivered as he came, cum pooling beneath him and soaking into his torso. As the afterglow faded he felt his balls and cock shrinking futher until they pulled into his body entirely, leaving a smooth patch of fabric where his genitals had been. It still felt good though, and he rubbed himself against the floor in the hope of making himself feeling still better.<br />
<br />
 As the now familiar hollowness advanced further up his legs he felt a tingling in his fingertips. He thrust his hands at the mirror and wriggled his fingers so he could observe the change overtaking him, watching as they shrank into stubs before his eyes. He watched fascinated as his hands vanished before his eyes, leaving in their place holes at the end of his arms. He watched in awe as his arms began to diminish, feeling the same thing happening to what was left of his legs. As this happened he watched and felt his hair shrinking into his body, leaving his body perfectly smooth and his head bald. His skin also smoothed out, removing any blemishes, and his nipples and belly button were absorbed into his body as well, leaving his &#39;skin&#39; as unblemished white cotton.<br />
<br />
&#39;I really look ridiculous now&#39; he chuckled to himself, but surprisingly he didn&#39;t mind his bizarre half-man half-clothing appearance. This was at least partly due to the undeniable pleasure his transformation was giving him, but also because he knew that soon he&#39;d be in his true form, that of a tanktop. As he stirred himself from his thoughts he saw that his arms had completely vanished, leaving him as a torso with holes where his arms once were. As he notices that Matt begins to feel a strange emptiness, feeling the loss of his bodyparts for the first time. If he can&#39;t have his own arms then he at least wants some other arms to take their place. Matt realises that this is the first of the mental effects that the transformation is having on him, the beginning of the need for another man to fill him up. The thought excited him, he was beginning to become an object physically as well as mentally. <br />
<br />
He noticed his legs finally disappearing but was not prepared for what happened next, as his asshole suddenly began to stretch. Matt had had some sizable things up his ass before but this was better/worse than any fucking he&#39;d had, it felt like he was actually been torn apart. Which in practice he was, as his asshole swallowed up his asscheeks and the rest of his pelvic region, leaving a gaping hole at the bottom of his body to match his armholes. A sudden breeze entered his bottom hole, making him shiver and flap about a little. The wind penetrated surprisingly deeply into his body, making Matt aware that he was emptying pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
He saw that his torso was rapidly deflating like a punctured balloon, with his head the only solid part of him left.  The emptiness was starting to consume him now, he was willing the transformation to complete so he could properly become clothing and find a man to complete him. He felt his mouth being forced open still wider, forcing his face upwards until he was forced to stare up at the ceiling. This situation didn&#39;t last long however, as Matt&#39;s vision began to fade rapidly. It was like his eyes were being painted over or something, but he knew that they were really being absorbed into his body. He could feel his ears and nose being absorbed into his body as well, leaving him with touch as his only available sense. Being cut off from the world drove Matt wild and he thrashed about as much as he could in the darkness. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he could see again, though not in the manner he was accustomed to. His viewpoint was fixed dead ahead in the mirror on front of him, which showed him the image of a white tanktop somehow flailing about by itself. The realisation that this tanktop was him, that he really was an object now, hit Matt and caused him to instantly go limp. Clothing did not move after all, and therefore it was right that he lie here immobile until he was claimed by an owner. As he lay there he found that he could actually shift his vision, not like a human would but akin to switching camera angles. He could even see inside himself, though a sight comprised entirely of white cotton wasn&#39;t the most interesting.<br />
<br />
Despite his acceptance of his inanimate nature he still occasionally shivered, his fabric was so sensitive that the slightest breeze was capable of throwing him into spasms of ecstasy. Though even these movements faded over time along with his thoughts as he gazed lustfully at his own image, surrendering completely to his existence as an object. The tanktop lay still on the ground in a pool of drying cum, waiting for someone to wear it.</p>
