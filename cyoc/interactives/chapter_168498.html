<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dillon was looking around for more potential changes until he saw a group of people in the distance. It was a group of his closet friends. Bryce, Adam, and Jade were all hanging around at a picnic table. Dillon thought he&#39;d join them, but not before changing them so to not make it to awkward. <br />
<br />
First off, Dillon mad a change to Adam. &quot;Adam will become a minotaur with the same physique as me.&quot; The ring glowed and Adams muscles started bulging similar to Dillon&#39;s. His shoes burst revealing hooves with brown hair growing up to his legs. His pants were still in tact despite his new bull package taking space, but a bulge in the seat of his pants ripped right open to reveal a long ropey tail with a tassel. Dillon saw that his nose was become more bovine and his ears were become long and pointed outward. Finally two horns erupted from his head completing his change. Adam, or the other two didn&#39;t seem to mind that He was now a beefy bull man which made Dillon chuckle.<br />
<br />
Next was Jade. &quot;Jade will become a cow minotaur and Adam&#39;s lover.&quot; The ring reacted, and Jade stared changing. Like Adam, her muscles started to grow. Not as big as his or Adam&#39;s, but she was still quite muscular. She removed her sandals as her feet become hooves and white hair traveled up her legs. Unlike Adam, Jade&#39;s pants after stretching from the crotch burst out revealing a large and full udder, and a white ropey tail with a black tassel grew from her lower back. From her chest, her breasts grew from C cups to double Ds as milk leaked from her bra. Her face grew into a bovine snout with her ears elongating with white fur, and two smaller horns grew from her head. The second Jade finished, Adam let out a large moo to confess his attraction. The two looked at each other smiling as Bryce took out his phone and started texting.<br />
<br />
Finally it was Bryce&#39;s turn. &quot;Bryce will become a raptor from the waist down and his face will become a reptilian snout.&quot; Dillon looked at Bryce to see his shoes ripping open as red scaled clawed feet came out of the remains. His legs also started to get thicker and took on a more digigrade look. His lower back began to bulge and his pants were completely ripped apart by his long thick tail. The rest of his pants ripped to reveal red scales all over traveling up to his waist. Dillon noticed his nose was flattening and his mouth was pushing out becoming a reptilian snout complete with red scales. Bryce let out a yawn to confirm his teeth had reshaped into become razor sharp and his tongue forked.<br />
<br />
Dillon looked at the group of his changed friends feeling satisfied. However, He felt left out because of the multiple animal features they had and he just had a tail. &quot;My legs will become reptilian and I will grow a snout like Bryce.&quot; Dillon felt his feet from in his shoes as they burst becoming three toed claws with the scales climbing up to his waist. He also noticed a change in perspective as his nose grew into a reptilian snout complete with scales. Dillon was his scales changed color just like his tail which pleased him. He wiggled his new toes to get a used to them as he lost two toes in the process. He looked back to his group of friends laughing together completely unnerved by the changes they went through. Dillon decided to make his approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up guys?&quot; He asked smiling through his new snout. &quot;Not too much. Just... Made it official.&quot; Adam said looking back at Jade. Dillon knew what it meant, but he figured he&#39;d humor them. &quot;What&#39;s official?&quot; He asked. &quot;Me and Adam are now a couple.&quot; Jade told Dillon slightly twitching her tail. &quot;So I guess congrats are in order. You guys going to head to a bar.&quot; Bryce asked. &quot;Maybe. Or we could just stay at my place. I was promised I finally get to milk her udder.&quot; Adam said excitedly. &quot;Only if I get to milk you afterwards.&quot; Jade said back. &quot;Okay, enough. We&#39;re in a public park.&quot; Bryce commented. Dillon couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. Their conversations didn&#39;t seem normal to him, but they were still mostly comfortable talking like that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dillon, you still got tail cramps by the way?&quot; Bryce asked. Dillon didn&#39;t know how to respond. He never even had a tail up until an hour ago. &quot;Uh... No. Not really.&quot; Dillon answered. &quot;Well if they come back, I got a doctor whose good with reptilian folk like us. He gave me prescription pills and the work just fine.&quot; He said waving his tail back and forth. &quot;I&#39;ll text you his number.&quot; He said typing on his phone. Dillon&#39;s phone vibrated and showed the text with a phone number. &quot;So give him a call whenever. He&#39;ll be happy to help.&quot; Dillon curled his tail in delight as it turned a brighter green to show he&#39;s happy with the information. &quot;Thanks. I wish I could stay, but I only have a few minutes to jog. Me and Tess got plans tonight.&quot; Dillon said wagging his tail. &quot;Oh, more love confessions today?&quot; Jade commented. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll fall for me.&quot; He said grasping his ring on his finger. &quot;I mean with a body like that, who wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Adam said flexing his muscles. &quot;Right. See you guys soon.&quot; Dillon said jogging away.<br />
<br />
Dillon didn&#39;t have plans with Tess before, but the ring could easily make a change in schedule for both of them. Dillon continued his jog waiting for more opportunities to change.</p>
