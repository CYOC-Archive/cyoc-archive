<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice paused.  &quot;How would that ever help me?  Won&#39;t it just transform me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The werecow continued to massage her udder.  &quot;Of course it will.  Nevertheless, I strongly recommend drinking.  Just don&#39;t drink too deeply and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I trust you at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For a few reasons...&quot;  The werecow lifted her massive body off the floor, causing her breasts and udder to sway and slosh uncontrollably.  In a flash, she closed the gap between Alice and herself, grabbing Alice by the torso.  The most Alice could do is squeak as her ribs were compressed as she was lifted off the floor.  Her feet dangled uselessly until the werecow brought her devastatingly close to her bosom, causing her knees to rest on the bipedal cow&#39;s udder.  &quot;First, I could very easily force you to drink until you were fully changed.  If you had tried to run, I would have easily caught and transformed you.&quot;  With a toothy grin, the werecow set her back down, then return to the spot Alice had first found her.<br />
<br />
Clearly shaken, Alice knew there was no escape.  Were all the beasts in this dungeon so dangerous?  Heck, if cows were less dangerous, did that mean all the beasts were even worse?  &quot;Wh-what o-other reasons...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The werecow slowly laid her body back to the dungeon floor until she was back in a lounging position.  &quot;Second, I was once an adventurer.  Seeing one of of my old kin has always struck my heartstrings.&quot;  There was a pregnant silence, as Alice wasn&#39;t sure if she expected a response or not.  It was challenging to tell through the werecow&#39;s furred muzzle.  &quot;Which brings me to my last reason: I wish to brand you for your protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  I thought you wanted me to drink your milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
The werecow sighed.  &quot;Yes, which would invoke a minor transformation.  There are a good number of denizens within this dungeon.  Over time, we&#39;ve managed to create systems to keep things more...Orderly.  If you go into the dungeon entirely human, you will be hunted by every group relentlessly so that they can bring you into their tribe.  If you&#39;re already marked by a bestial transformation, the non-minotaur werebeasts will not seek to transform you further.  Indeed, most werecows will likely not seek to transform you, either.  It&#39;s mostly the males you&#39;ll need to watch out for.&quot;<br />
<br />
The werecow paused, then knocked on the side of her head with a hoof-hand.  &quot;I nearly forgot.  You will still need to avoid any demons.  If you spot any, try to find other werebeasts to protect you.  Of course, this assumes you accept my offer to be branded by me.  You can try going in alone, but I guarantee being a werecow is one of the least will-breaking options you can get, and most of the denizens won&#39;t give you a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice knew she didn&#39;t standa  chance, delving into a dungeon of more aggressive, stronger creatures than this werecow.  She approached the werecow&#39;s udder.  It sat lazily on the floor, larger than any cow udder she&#39;d seen.  More surprisingly, it didn&#39;t even look overly-full.  The teats were easily longer than her hand.  She turned to the werecow.  &quot;And I only need to drink a little?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear.  Of course, you&#39;ll likely find it to be some of the best milk you&#39;ve ever had.  Drink a drop if you can, or drink deeply and join my herd.  It&#39;s your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice took the teat in-hand.  She wished that she had a bucket, or a bottle, or something to control the milk flow, but she also didn&#39;t want milk all over her clothes or to lap it up off the dungeon floor.  She stuck the teat in her mouth, only getting it an inch or two in.  She gave a testing suckle, and was shocked as a small flood of milk spilled into her mouth.<br />
<br />
As the cow had promised, the milk tasted absolutely fantastic.  In a brief lapse of judgment, Alice gulped down a few mouthfuls before realizing what she was doing, and pulled herself off the werecow.  Her benefactor continued to massage her udder.  &quot;Ah, the new ones always feel so unique compared to the regulars down here!&quot;<br />
<br />
The milk sat heavily in Alice&#39;s gut as she waited for something to happen.  She wasn&#39;t sure if it was magic or just the growing dread, but she was solely focused on the fluid in her stomach, waiting for some kind of signal that it was beginning to affect her.  Was it her focus, or was the dreaded feeling multiplying?<br />
<br />
Alice looked down, and realized that the pressure was further down than usual.  The pressure in her gut was starting to press against her shirt and pants.  When she looked down, there was a noticeable curve to her belly that showed through her clothes, and it was growing by the second!<br />
<br />
Frantic, Alice undid her pants and lifted her shirt.  She was starting to look pregnant with how bulbous her stomach had become.  She pleadingly looked to the werecow.  &quot;What happening to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her bovine companion stopped rubbing herself, then looked to Alice.  She gave a warm smile after a brief glance.  &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a lucky one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice buckled to the floor as her belly continued to swell.  However, the flesh had begun to grow pink as the skin texture switched from human to something more animalistic.  When four distinct lumps appeared on it, Alice realized what she was growing: an udder!  Through labored breaths, she chose to respond.  &quot;Lucky?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, very lucky.  As I said, the creatures of this dungeon feed on cum and milk.  Now, you&#39;ve got a way to pay those creatures off.  Furthermore, there are few beasts that grow an udder.  If you&#39;d grown horns, a tail, or something similarly minor, some werefolk might ignore your protests.  With that udder between your legs, there is no shade of doubt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The udder continued to swell, its proportion entirely off to the small human figure it was attached to.  As Alice stood up, the udder fought to take space between her legs.  Its four teats now waggled in the stale dungeon air.  She waddled a few uncertain steps, the monstrous udder swaying her body in all sorts of unfamiliar ways.  &quot;How am I going to get anywhere with this thing attached to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could always drink some more, until you get a werecow&#39;s muscle or size.  Or you could let me &#39;lighten your load.&#39;  Of course, I&#39;d recommend just taking things slow and careful.  You&#39;ll be safer if you don&#39;t draw attention by running around and panicking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, the sloshing udder seemed to stop pressing outward.  Alice wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d deal with it, but she was now able to enter the dungeon.</p>
