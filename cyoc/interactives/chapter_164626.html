<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, son. We&#39;re going to have to have you choose a body. Come on, young lad!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nicky was super excited. He followed Chuck, who was only a little bit older than he was but looked like he was in his mid 20s, and Mr. Anton. They went back into the funny glowing hall and then Anton waved his hand. The doors all went haywire and zoomed past them by the hundreds until they came to one with an ornate brass handle. The two men opened the door and let the young kindergartner inside. <br />
<br />
Before him were glass cases like you would see in a museum. It looked like a museum too, with dim lighting allowing him to see inside the cases. Inside each one was a man, and all the men looked like they were sleeping. There were men of all races, heights and ages. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, now we&#39;re going to have to pick a body for you, young one. Then you won&#39;t be so young anymore!&quot; Anton exclaimed, and he stroked his silver-white beard. He had such big muscles straining against his dress shirt and tie. And he was so tall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I can be tall and...and...and be a grown up finally and...have a job??&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure can, buddy. I did that for Chuck here. He&#39;s only a little guy, too. Found him when he was on a field trip in Grade 4 and he&#39;s been working for me ever since. All my boys help me find other boys to turn into men or men into boys sometimes!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So your job is to change people&#39;s ages, Mister Anton?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Men and boys only, I&#39;m afraid. And please, just call me Papa Wolfe. Everyone else does.&quot; Papa Wolfe grinned. <br />
<br />
Nicky had a look of total innocent happiness as he walked down the aisle looking at all the tall men. Most of them were only wearing their undies! There were men with black hair, brown hair, blond and red hair. Nicky had longish wild light brown auburn hair. He was an adorable boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t I just be me but older, Papa Wolfe?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, because I have a special magic. Everyone in my line of work has their own different transformation abilities. We look for mortals that we can make into, well, heroes. Special boys like you who like adventure, who are actually interested in learning...I like to help those boys the best.&quot; Papa Wolfe&#39;s eyes gleamed. &quot;But it has to be one of these bodies. Your body will stay here on display and you don&#39;t have to stay in any particular body if you don&#39;t want to. Though if you want a second body after this one I might have to charge you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Charge me? Like a light socket?&quot; <br />
<br />
The two men laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, Nicky, Papa means you have to pay him something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t have any money!&quot; Nicky was suddenly worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, Nicky. It might not be money so much as...a service you render me. Nothing you can&#39;t do. Now, tell me, what time would you like to live in. So you don&#39;t have to live with all the well...muckety muck of 2020, hmm? The 50s? The 60s? You could be a father, a sailor, an adventurer. Or the 70s or 80s. You could be a policeman or a detective or a big businessman. Or maybe a warehouse or construction worker would be more to your liking...&quot; He could read the young lad&#39;s face well. Nicky burst into an eager grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, yes! I want to drive a forklift!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit, lad! You know, you might like the 90s. They were relatively fun. I could send you to 1992 in the Midwest. Or maybe Arizona. Let&#39;s look for just the perfect body.&quot; <br />
<br />
They must have looked at 50 different bodies until Nicky saw one that really struck him. The man was lean but well muscled. He had short light brown hair, almost golden. He had short sideburns and was incredibly handsome, to the point where he could easily be a model, similar pretty looks to a young Brad Pitt or Sean Patrick Flanery, 90s actors who captured a certain look of boyish charm. His chin was pointed, and he had soft, inviting eyes. A small, sharp nose and perfect lips, with the faintest trace of stubble gracing his flawless skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes. I think 1992 would be a perfect year for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Will my Daddy be there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes. And young Chuck will accompany you on your first few forays into the adult world. He&#39;ll teach you to use your new body in...every way you need to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s put an outfit on this guy.&quot; Chuck waved his fingers through the air and a dusty off white cowboy hat appeared on the stud&#39;s head, along with some slightly shredded jeans and a tight white T-shirt with a few dirt stains on it. Finally, a big shiny belt buckle appeared with matching belt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I really be that tall??&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, 6 feet is considered tall when you&#39;re age 5, haha!&quot; Papa Wolfe replied. &quot;Now, close your eyes and repeat after me.&quot; Nicky did so. &quot;I wish I were model number A158, 1992. A158, 1992.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nicky did so, three times, hearing Papa Wolfe&#39;s voice. Suddenly he felt something shift underneath his feet, as if there was a slight earthquake. He opened his eyes. He was at a construction site. In the distance were some pretty blue gray mountains. Around him were piles of ochre colored earth and many piles of pipes about a meter in diameter.  He looked down. He had boots on, the kind you needed to work heavy duty construction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Cool boots! Hey. My voice!&quot; It sounded rich and poetic, with a slight Texan accent. &quot;ABC 123. Testing testing. I&#39;m Nicky Cubison...talking in my new super cool voice! Wow! Hey, my legs!!!&quot; His voice sounded so wonderfully different, Nicky thought. He shifted his big tall legs under him, picking them up experimentally, one at a time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, isn&#39;t it? When you get your first adult moment and you&#39;re all tall. It&#39;s pretty awesome,&quot; Chuck told him. Chuck had more stubble than Nicky now did, and he felt his face in wonder. It was a little stubbly! He rubbed it up and down, up and down.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pretty freshly shaved. Just wait a few days and it&#39;ll feel like sandpaper.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna see your face?&quot; Chuck asked, and produced a large circular mirror out of thin air, hovering at face level. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! I have face hair! I could grow a beard!&quot; Nicky marveled at himself, looking like the most easily impressed yokel as he looked at himself in wonder. Such an innocent look on such a studly face, Chuck thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you could. So,&quot; Chuck rubbed his hands together. He had movie star good looks. Not all of the men in the Hall of Bodies did. Some were homely and strong, but Chuck had a mischievous look to him, licking his lips and looking at Nicky a little bit differently than before. &quot;Hold on tight. You need a crash course in how to do construction work and warehouse work. We&#39;ll start you off with working a forklift and then I&#39;ll have you do other things. Other grown ups won&#39;t remember that, though. It&#39;s sort of part of the uh...program.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Program?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s...complicated. You&#39;ll learn all the science stuff later, kid.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a kid now! Look at me! I bet I&#39;m like 20 or 30 years old!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re 21 years old, to be specific. Just old enough to drink. Your ID is in your wallet.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nicky got it out of his jeans pocket as soon as Chuck told him about it. It had several hundred dollars in cash. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Look at all this money!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well don&#39;t spend that all in one place. I have to teach you the general value of things in this time. Let&#39;s see...&quot; Chuck hit a bunch of empty spaces in the air and suddenly Nicky understood that something had happened. Chuck quizzed him on how much apples cost, and then other foodstuffs, a car, an apartment, etc. before he was satisfied. &quot;Okay, you absorbed all that well. Let&#39;s see how you do with factory forklift and then after a few days of that I&#39;ll graduate you to construction forklift. Then builder and hey, would you like to man the wrecking ball that knocks old buildings over?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Would I! Yee haw! Hey. Why&#39;d I say that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Basic programming for your model. You&#39;ll speak like a Texan because you&#39;re from there in this particular universe setting. Now here&#39;s the thing to remember. Your dad hasn&#39;t changed in looks but we had to make him a little bit older in this particular scenario. So he&#39;s 45 now instead of in his 30s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll just look a little older. But that doesn&#39;t matter because we can always make him younger. And we&#39;ll have to have a talk with him. He&#39;s actually with another agent right now, who is explaining everything to him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This is all so cool. I&#39;m taller than you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the model I&#39;m in is average height, above average looks. But you don&#39;t have to stay in any one body, you can change things around. All you have to do is ask. But, we want you to try as many things in this universe as possible first.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wooooooow.&quot; Nicky looked as his new muscular bicep. This body was lean and he felt so strong! He flexed his arm over and over. <br />
<br />
&quot;15 inches. Not bad. You have a nice chest, too. Alright, loverboy. Let&#39;s get you started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck waved a hand and everything shifted again so they traveled several hundred meters in a second and then he did it again until they were standing in an industrial warehouse yard with a shiny yellow forklift meant for lifting up heavy pallets of wooden boards or pipes. Nicky started skipping around, rather immaturely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...dude. Stop skipping around. You&#39;re not five anymore!&quot; Chuck told him, cracking up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Sorry. I didn&#39;t know.&quot; Nicky said, sounding embarrassed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, the whole acting like a grownup thing is something you just have to learn. I&#39;m ten but I&#39;ve been a grown up for a whole year, so I know all about that stuff,&quot; Chuck bragged. &quot;Alright, warehouse program downloading....now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nicky&#39;s head was filled with new knowledge as he looked around him. He knew the names of all the controls on all of the equipment. He looked down and found a clipboard with a schedule on it. He knew he had to get the pallets in front of him onto truck C7. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, time to start work. Your lunch is at 12:30, Big Guy,&quot; Chuck slapped him on the arm with a big grin. &quot;Today I&#39;ll be playing the big boss of the company. My father owns this whole building in this scenario.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I get to be a grownup!&quot; Nicky said, jumping up and down in glee, looking more like a hyperactive little boy than a grown man old enough to drink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Settle down, settle down, kid! Try and act mature.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right. Sorry, I&#39;m a grown up and so I shall...grow up! Hey, did you notice I can think of words now that I didn&#39;t know before?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I gave you a slight vocabulary increase. Basic education model.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. I know more adult words now. Like...larceny and felony and...there&#39;s a lot of grown up rules about what you can&#39;t do,&quot; His eyebrows furrowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I had to do that for legal reasons. You&#39;re fully acquainted with laws that dictate adult behavior. Now get onto that forklift and have fun, Nick Cubison!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!!!!&quot; Nick, as he realized he was now known, practically hopped for joy. He could operate a big manly vehicle now! He spent all afternoon having fun operating the machine. This was way better than staying home! he thought. He lifted the pallets of large sacks of fertilizer onto a truck right before the lunch whistle sounded. He hopped down on his new long legs and practically ran to the lunch area. He had a big heavy metal lunch box which he opened up with all his new coworkers. They were Dad&#39;s coworkers. Doug and Ronnie were there and there...there was Daddy! <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Son,&quot; his father replied. They were now almost the same height. His father was still a few inches taller but Nick was overjoyed he could look right into his father&#39;s eyes. His dad had definitely gotten handsomer as he&#39;d gotten older. Intense blue eyes, dapper handsome laugh lines and graying dark-blond hair. Nick&#39;s father Mal had a big deep voice, and was a total Robert Redford/ <br />
Thomas Haden Church type Chuck thought, from the same table. <br />
<br />
Chuck enjoyed the role he was now playing. He loved the reality shifts of Papa Wolfe&#39;s world. Nick and his father didn&#39;t know it yet, but they were in for a world of fun. He had chosen wisely. Both of them had met the standards for reality replacement and this was only his third recruitment. He had been very proud of his work among the immortal Male Transformation League that made up so many distinguished magicians that changed boys and men into anything their hearts desired. But it was meticulous work on his end. Luckily, he was feeding a new sex program into the reality they were now in...<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Dad. You look different but...really good. You&#39;re really handsome.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you too, son. So these guys explained it to me. Probably a little bit better than you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Freeze,&quot; Chuck said, and Ronnie and Doug froze from talking in mid air. &quot;We thought we&#39;d let him get used to things first. Oh and Ronnie and Doug only in the first reality or so. We&#39;re gonna send them back in a bit. They won&#39;t remember any of this. But we fully briefed your Dad and we told him we can always return you to your reality but...this whole experience is beneficial for the two of you. You can go from time period to time period. Body to body. Your Dad has a slightly improved physique as well. We threw that in, but he might look different if you guys change jobs or decades. Understand? We&#39;ll talk after your shift is over about settling in. I&#39;m going to unfreeze these guys. Remember, don&#39;t talk to them about your real age or the year you&#39;re from. As far as anyone else knows, it&#39;s 1992 and you didn&#39;t time travel or grow up overnight, okay? <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, I just want you to know that I am really excited about all of this. I know it&#39;s crazy but these magic reality changing guys? They get something out of giving us whatever we want! I mean, within reason. They explained it. See, you and I can be in any bodies we want to be. I think that&#39;s pretty exciting because this whole new universe thing? It&#39;s a job! They are going to pay us by giving us experiences. Now, I was really worried about turning you into a grown man. I was very worried but now...I just know it&#39;s the right thing to do. You really wanted this and now we&#39;re both free to do whatever we want. I&#39;m so happy, man. I can&#39;t wait to spend more time with you.&quot; Mal clapped a friendly hand on his son&#39;s shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go to the park again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we&#39;ll be doing a lot of things, a helluva lot of things more than the park,&quot; Mal told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s start time again. Aaaaaand unfreeze,&quot; Chuck said.  <br />
<br />
Ronnie and Doug went back to talking. <br />
<br />
Chuck smiled. Mal had required just a little bit of tweaking. They had made it so that he required no convincing, in other words he would believe Anton and Chuck with whatever they told him, and since they weren&#39;t lying that wasn&#39;t a problem. The real challenge was getting him to go along with it. But ultimately, when they showed him the life he could eventually have as one of the richest men on Earth, they convinced him. He would have to go through many scenarios though, and in each of the universes, Papa Wolfe would get more data. The more data, the better it was for the Male Transformation League so that it&#39;s immortal workers stayed immortal.<br />
<br />
And they were just getting started, Chuck thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, son. Wanna drive us home?&quot; Mal dangled the keys. 21 year old Nick marveled and gawked at the keys and then started to do a dance and he started skipping around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, you can&#39;t skip around like that. You look ridiculous. Now come on, let&#39;s go to the truck and you can drive for the first time.&quot; Mal said it so casually that Nick couldn&#39;t believe it. <br />
<br />
He started the engine and yelled &quot;Yeeee haw!&quot; before pulling out of the dirt paved road and back home. He couldn&#39;t believe he was in the driver&#39;s seat. And he didn&#39;t need a booster seat! He was having so much fun he couldn&#39;t believe it. He was driving with other grown ups and they were in a new town but it was like he knew it, too. Nick got out of the truck and it felt so good to walk around a street or parking lot but...taller! Way taller! Like he was on stilts all the time but the stilts were his legs! <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m only five years old, but I get to be a grown up and tall, Daddy!&quot; Nick said once they were inside. He started flexing his arms. He was realizing it felt really good to flex his big muscles, sinewy and veiny. <br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything yet, son. There&#39;s one more thing you have to experience today and I think you know what that is...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;When they told me they changed us to both be gay, I had already taken the job. They had already given me this big muscular bod. I weigh almost 80 pounds more than I did just this morning. Did you notice that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, your muscles are huge! They&#39;re bigger than mine, huh Dad?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh they&#39;re much bigger. So do you understand sex, son?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Dad. But I&#39;ve never had it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dad kissed him,  passionately, strongly, his musky odor overpowering Nick. Daddy smelled so good! Dad let his own cowboy hat slip off and fall to the ground. His son soon got rid of his. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Daddy! I can&#39;t believe that you kissed me! That felt amazing! But isn&#39;t it wrong?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not in this universe, babe. They fixed it all. So now that I am gay and you&#39;re a fucking hot stud and my son I say we say fuck it and go for it. I don&#39;t care if they programmed it into me and that I was straight before. I just want to be with you. The attraction is more powerful than anything I&#39;ve ever felt. Like the hottest woman times ten. That&#39;s how fucking hot you are. My hormones are fucking exploding! Fuuuuuuuck.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah! Hey, I cursed!&quot; Nick laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be so great for...&quot; They slurped each other&#39;s mouths, and Daddy took off his shirt next, with a feral look in his eye. His son was still innocent in the ways of sex and he was gonna teach him that, goddamnit! This was going to be fucking awesome! He never thought he&#39;d say that about fucking his own flesh and blood but he had never been this ready for sex before...ever! <br />
<br />
They grabbed each other and then headed into the bedroom where they tangled in each other&#39;s bodies, Nick moaning and moaning. His father undid his belt buckle  and then his son&#39;s. Both men shucked off their jeans and threw them over the end of the bed before tumbling back to each other, missing each other&#39;s lips for that short time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Show me your dick, son!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky did so. It was a nice 7 inch dick fully coming to attention now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. It&#39;s bigger! Oh, this is called an erection!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very good, tiger. It is called an erection. Let&#39;s show you how good it feels to suck one!&quot; Dad said, with enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
He sucked his son&#39;s delicious, perfect cock and Nick went to a joy he had never known before. It hurt in the most wonderful way, his father&#39;s tongue teasing his peehole. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH, God. Oh, my gooooooooooood.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before long the burning sensation in his new dick finally...BURST. Like peeing but...SO MUCH MORE! It was just relief and it was amazing. He came and came, his dick hitting the roof of his father&#39;s hot mouth eagerly waiting to swallow its prize. <br />
<br />
His father looked at him passionately and kissed him with the lips that had just tasted his son&#39;s cum. &quot;How do you like that, son? You sweet hot fucking stud you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmmm. I really liked it. It was amazing. Oh wow. Being an adult rules!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We got so much more ahead, babe.&quot; His father flexed his much bigger bicep in front of his son. <br />
<br />
Yeah, he thought. It would be considered wrong by a lot of people, but...he had never known pleasure like this before. His son was 21 years old now! And hot as fuck! <br />
<br />
Life was good, he thought, his son tasting his father&#39;s stubble and playing with his tongue.</p>
