<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;First, let&#39;s see to your immediate needs, my friend.&quot; Rick offered. &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Famissshed.&quot; The serpent admitted, nodding slightly. &quot;My ssstomach is calling for food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I expected so. The transformative process was likely to have used up most of your energy. Then let&#39;s get you fed.&quot; Rick stood from the desk with a middle aged grunt. He reached for the snake to pick her up and suddenly realized his social error as she recoiled her neck in offense. &quot;Would you, that is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss?&quot; The serpent hissed with slight amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, we need to go upstairs to get a bite.&quot; He blushed slightly, smiling at his own nerdiness. &quot;Would you like to... er, walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
The viper hissed gently, flicking out her tongue, and shook her head. &quot;You may carry me if it isss fassster, Rick. All I want isss for you to asssk before you handle me. Isss that fair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Vipress. Of course.&quot; Rick nodded, blushing even redder. He extended his hands and watched in awe as the snake slithered off the desk and placed her long sinewy body around his arm. She twisted around his forearm and up the shoulder of his shirt, sliding effortlessly around his neck and perching herself across his shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
She was heavy! Rick noted, thick and weighty with powerful serpentine muscle. He turned to regard her face and she smiled again warmly, the glassy scales below her eyes lightening slightly in embarassment. &quot;Thisss isss a lovely perch, Rick. I might like it up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The chemist chuckled, starting towards the stairs. &quot;A bit more cozy than the desk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sssofter.&quot; The snake said cheerily. &quot;Muccch warmer too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; Rick began up the stairs with the viper holding fast around his neck and back. &quot;It couldn&#39;t have been comfortable to be in cold steel. Are you chilled?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am growing warm now.&quot; The viper said dreamily. &quot;I will be fine, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very articulate.&quot; Rick said as he saw Virpess brighten against the natural light of the upstairs. She shifted slightly on his neck and took in the warm summer air blowing from the open living room window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss.&quot; The snake agreed. &quot;You mussst tell me how it isss that you&#39;ve changed me ssso.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon enough, my friend.&quot; Rick said happily. &quot;First, we&#39;ll have lunch. I think I have something you&#39;ll love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, that sssounds intriquing!&quot; Vipress said excitedly. &quot;My firssst tassste of human cussstomsss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite.&quot; Rick smiled, shifting his shoulders slightly against Vipress&#39;s weighty body. He stared at her face momentarily and she blushed again as she caught his eye, shying away slightly by pulling her neck back. &quot;Feeling good and warm now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss.&quot; The viper nodded. &quot;I feel much more agreeable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Rick nodded, bringing out a frying pan from the cupboard to the snake&#39;s utter fascination. She watched his movements eagerly, curious. Odd, Rick thought, she somehow looked bigger. Perhaps he was seeing things.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the fridge, drew out a pack of bacon from the crisper, and with Vipress in tow he slashed open the package and dumped the contents into the frying pan. He turned on the burner, and the snake watched with total awe as the bacon in the pan began to sizzle and pop, kicking off the distinctive aroma of cooking pig flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meat.&quot; The snake flicked her tongue eagerly, picking up the delightful scent of food. &quot;I am practically sssalivating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d like that.&quot; Rick smiled. She... did feel heavier. &quot;Uh, tell me, Vipress, do you feel any different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; The sssnake drew her predatory gaze from the hypnotic frying pan and over to Rick. My god, he realized, she really was getting bigger! Her face, her body, her weight. She was longer, thicker, larger. She was growing in size! Slowly, but enough to be noticable. &quot;Oh, I am feeling very well, Rick! Almossst giddy!&quot; The snake smiled again, oblivious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; The chemist smirked. &quot;May I set you down on the counter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of courssse!&quot; Vipress swayed happily, sliding down Rick&#39;s shoulder, her head and body trailing down his hand and slipping onto the countertop with graceful ease. She coiled herself contentedly and raised her head in front of the cupboard, eagerly watching the bacon sizzle. &quot;Thisss sssmellsss incredible!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick prodded at it with a fork, eyeing the snake in both amazement and utter bewilderment as she was now visibly growing. Oh so slowly but surely. By the time the raw bacon began to darken up and begin crisping, the snake was considerably larger. As she stared from the pan to Rick, she must have finally noticed something off. She cocked her head to the side, still slowly growing by the second, and seemed to be trying to puzzle out what was different.<br />
<br />
As the bacon reached the perfect level of crispness, Rick quickly turned off the burner and stood inches from the snake. She blinked her reptilian eyes in disbelief as she came eye level to Rick on the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What...&quot; The serpent blinked again and again. She looked back to the frying pan, then around the kitchen in bewildered surprise, and then back at rick with the most shocked expression a sentient pit viper could muster.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Rick!&quot; Vipress realized. &quot;I am... bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still growing.&quot; Rick whispered in awe, watching in shock and fascination as the snake slowly enlarged. Not just bigger, as they had noted, but stronger and longer. Her coils had thickened with crushingly powerful musculature, while her length and overall size had grown more impressive than it had been. Sitting coiled on the countertop, the snake stared in nearly open mouthed shock as she keenly realized her thickening body was filling more and more space, her tail tip touching the back wall and her front nearly too big to lie there. Her head had raised almost a foot more than Rick as she sat there, now looking down on him instead of meeting him. Still, she grew onward.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got warm.&quot; Rick suggested. &quot;Perhaps your enlargement was only paused. Or slowed. Perhaps obtaining proper temperature kickstarted the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isss that posssible?&quot; Vipress asked in curiosity, looking down at herself and uncoiling slightly to save space. &quot;My goodness! I am sssooo huge now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May we test a theory?&quot; Rick smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss?&quot; Vipress looked back to Rick, still steadily bulking and lengthening.<br />
<br />
Rick picked up a slightly cooled strip of bacon and held it up to the snake&#39;s mouth. &quot;You said you were hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yesss!&quot; The viper said in realization. She smirked slightly and took the bacon into her mouth, snapping it in and crunching it before taking a gulp. &quot;Oh, wow!&quot; The snake said in almost orgasmic delight. &quot;That isss deliciousss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about another?&quot; Rick grinned, dangling another slice over the snake, which she was all too happy to accept. After six or seven slices of bacon down her gullet, Rick&#39;s eyes widened further as the snake&#39;s growth began to speed up.<br />
<br />
Almost plumetting off the counter, the reptile spilled around herself, growing and growing as the food touched her belly and immediately began to absorb into her. Eyes wide, terrified, the serpent stared at Rick in dumbfounded distress. &quot;R-Rick!&quot; She said nervously. &quot;What&#39;ssss... happening... to... meeee!&quot; The last word came out pained as the snake began to gasp and writhe. Quickly, Rick picked her up, gasping as the heavy trunk of the snake fell to his feet, her tail reaching a foot or more behind him. Above him, Vipress clenched her eyes and grimaced as her growth sped further and further.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Rick grabbed the last few slices of bacon and held them to the snake&#39;s mouth. Flicking out her tongue, she lapped the delicious greasy flavor and reflexively snapped at them, gulping them down and gasping. Carefully, Rick placed her writhing growing form on the kitchen tile and his eyes widened as her transformation continued at a quickening pace. She threw her head back, almost nine feet long and thicker than a man&#39;s arm at her widest section.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Rick!&quot; The snake said in confusion through hisses and moans, the deep light blush under her eyes growing warmer, extending to her whole face. &quot;I-I... sssssssomething&#39;sssss.... happening.... ssssooo.... hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
She began undulating her long serpentine body and seemed to arch the section from her neck to the base of her tail. She thrashed, hissed, and almost seemed to tear up from the stress, growing and growing more and more, until at nearly 11 feet long there was an audible straining noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;RICK!&quot; Vipress cried, her eyes shooting open in shock and surprise before her head fell back and her body began to spasm in tight gripping shivers.<br />
<br />
Rick stared dumbfounded as his eyes trailed down from her twisting facial expression down the long curve of her neck, her trunk, and... he gasped and put his hands over his mouth in red hot embarassment as the now giant serpent came to orgasm, a slick trail of white fluid drooling from the puffed up vaginal opening down her midsection.<br />
<br />
The snake seemed to pause momentarily, shuddering through half open eyes that had fallen back into her head. As it ebbed and began to subside, her heavy breathing picked up as she looked down at herself in alarm and then to the mortified Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sssssomething elsssseee issss.... isss.....&quot; She tensed suddenly and strained her body as she began to crackle and stretch...</p>
