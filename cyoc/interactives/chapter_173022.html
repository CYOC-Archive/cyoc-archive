<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tina and Fredrick continued to masturbate with the fruit-dildo for another few minutes, attempting unsuccessfully to reach a more satisfying climax, before giving up and moving on with their day, leaving Josh alone on the school grounds. Christy, still feeling  guilty for some of the life-ruining transformations she inflicted on people when she first got the TF gun, shoots Josh from the bushes intending to makes her life a bit more livable, while still pushing her for cheating. <br />
<br />
After the shot, Joshes tree body rumbles a bit before Josh steps out of it, her body, still covered in bark and leaves, unmelding with the tree. Christy had given Josh the ability to move back, but the dryad still had to spend long periods inside the tree on school grounds to “recharge”, for every hour she spent in her tree she would get an hour outside of it, after her time was up, she would turn inanimate until someone brought her back to the tree. Another not immediately obvious aspect of the change was that Josh would now feel pleasure when people used her “home” tree&#39;s fruits as dildos or when people had sex with the vaginas embedded into the tree, as if they were her own sex organs. Christy had made it so the explanation for Josh being in her tree for the last four days was that she was going on a trip out of town to visit some relatives and need to build up enough time so she wouldn&#39;t run out while over there. Now that she had plenty of time built up, Josh went home to begin packing for the trip.<br />
<br />
Having seen Josh again, Christy was reminded of another person, Vicky, the one Josh had cheated on her with, and began heading over to her house, intending on at least making her change “normal” so as to not have it completly ruin her life. About an hours walk later, something made easy with Christy&#39;s cheerleader athleticism and double horse bodies, she arrived at the Johnson household and rang the doorbell.  The person who opened the door was an older woman with what could only be described as a “MILF bod”, with large breasts and wide hips, her black hair framed her brown-skinned face. The woman, presumably Vicky&#39;s mother, looked at Christy curiously and asked<br />
<br />
“Oh. Christy and Madison, what brings you here, I thought you and my daughter had a falling out after she started dating that nice dryad Josh?” Christy put on an (only half insincere) apologetic voice and replied<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was pretty upset with her, but after I heard what happened to her the other day I decided to let bygones be bygones and come comfort her. Is she around right now?” <br />
<br />
“Yes, when we brought her back home after the incident we had to remove the outward facing wall and take all her furniture out of her room just so she would fit. She&#39;s been in there ever since, hoplessly depressed. You actually arrived a a good time, another girl from school is also here, apparently something similar, though on a much smaller scale, happened to her and she&#39;s helping our daughter get used to the changes. Vicky&#39;s room is the door on the left down this hallway” Mrs Johnson replied, indicating the hallway in question as she let Christy and Madison inside.<br />
 <br />
As the conjoined girls made their way inside, Christy remembered that she had previously turned this woman&#39;s husband into a female sphinx and gave her a quick shot with the TF gun, giving her the ears, tail, and legs of a jackal, as well as a twenty five centimetre canine penis. Patting herself on the back for giving the wife and former husband a matching Egyptian theme, Christy heads down the hall to Vicky&#39;s room. As she approaches the door though, she begins to hear voices coming from behind the door.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing Brooke?”<br />
“I can&#39;t take it anymore”<br />
“stop climbing up my balls”<br />
“I cant help myself, your just to sexy!”<br />
“Get off me! Don t put that the- OHHHHHHH”<br />
“You ass is so tight Vicky!”<br />
<br />
Christy quietly opens the door to Vicky&#39;s room and peaks inside to sees Vicky, still a head on the end of a meter long cock attached to a headless body with humongous, car-sized balls, being fucked up the ass by Brooke&#39;s massive horsecock, their moans increasing in volume as both girls build towards orgasm. Christy is glad to see Brooke here, since she was the final person she wants to zap again to remove their memory of being transformed. Seeing this a a golden opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, Christy blasted the both of them with the TF gun.<br />
<br />
As Brooke continues to ram her horsecock up Vicky&#39;s ass, Vicky&#39;s headless body begins to shrink down, its mass fusing with the cock that held Vicky&#39;s head. Eventually, all that was left of Vicky was her ass, cock and balls, Brooke&#39;s horse cock was now bottomed out within the interior of her penis. Vicky&#39;s ass then fused into Brooke&#39;s body, as her cock-neck melded with tube of equine dick inside it, leaving Vicky&#39;s head attached to Brooke&#39;s now two meter long, and nearly a thirty centimetres thick horsecock. The next thing to change was Vicky&#39;s room, the roof rising higher and the outside wall pushing out into the backyard, every surface of the room became shiny, now covered in liquid resistant material, and a giant door, like the ones used to offload delivery trucks at large grocery stores, appeared in the wall facing the backyard. Several drains then appeared in the floor, connected to a drainable tank in the basement. Then large desk, designed so that Brooke can reach it from her perch atop her and Vicky&#39;s gigantic balls was brought into existence, complete with a computer setup and several monitors. Finally a massive padded trolley appeared below the newly conjoined pair&#39;s ball-sack. <br />
<br />
Reality had now changed so that Brooke and her living horsecock, Vicky, attend school via webcam most of the time, as moving them to and from school every day was impractical. When they need to attend school for important events, or when they just want to go somewhere, their body is pulled onto a modified hauling truck Vicky&#39;s parents owned, allowing her to be driven around in relative comfort. Brooke soon began stroking Vicky with a massive cock sleeve, the living cock now needing to cum several times per day to keep her balls from swelling. Due to their previous build up from before reality was modified the two of them soon came, litres of cum blasting out of Vicky&#39;s mouth, sliding off the walls and down into the drains in the floor. After nearly ten full minutes of orgasm, the stream halted, the conjoined girls left panting as they recovered. The spectacle of their orgasm was incredibly arousing to Christy, both Madison and her cock body began leaking precum out of their mouths as they peeped on the pair. <br />
<br />
Should Christy and Madison go inside and hang out, and almost certainly have sex, with the massive balled girl and her living horsecock or, now that she had changed everyone that had been aware of the changed reality other then her partner in crime Ella, sneak away and sate her lust by transforming people elsewhere?</p>
