<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Master looked at me, a sadistic smile on his face. &quot;A slave such as you must earn her privileges,&quot; he said, and unzipped his pants. &quot;Which hole should I use first?&quot;<br />
<br />
His cock sprang out. It was huge! &quot;He must have made it bigger,&quot; I thought. &quot;I was never that large.&quot; I reached out a hand, to touch it. And then it hit me. I was kneeling in front of myself, about to suck my own cock. I was salivating. My pussy was sopping wet, aching with need. And I came. I shuddered, moaned, my pussy spasmed. I was having a small orgasm just from the thought of what I was about to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did my little cunt just come?&quot; Master asked me.<br />
<br />
Composing myself, I nodded. &quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; I whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;From the thought of blowing me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I will save your first blowjob for later, then. Stand up, slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
I rose, unsteadily. Everything about my body felt so wrong. I had breasts, large breasts, hanging heavily from my chest. My hips felt impossibly wide, and it felt as if my entire body swayed as I moved my legs. But the worst thing was my feet. Having no chance of putting my heel to the ground, *having* to stand on tip-toe, it threw me off balance. The loss of balance sent my breasts and my ass wobbling, causing additional embarrassment. Trying to relax my leg muscles and not stand on the very tip of the balls of my feet brought a sharp pain. I had to steady myself on the desk to get up.<br />
<br />
When I was finally standing, finally starting to find my balance, I noticed how short I was. On my toes, my breasts barely cleared Masters desk. Sitting in his chair, he was eye level with me. I caught a glimpse at my reflection in the window - the girl looking back at me looked like some sort of perverts dream. I was actually slimmer than I had thought, or maybe it was just the large breasts and curvy hips that made my tummy look smaller.<br />
<br />
Master rose up in front of me, and suddenly my eyes went from being lever with his eyes to being level with his cock. It brushed against my lips, leaving a drop of precome which I quickly licked off.<br />
<br />
His hands went under my arms, and he lifted me up, dumping me down on his desk. My entire body jiggled as I landed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spread your legs!&quot; Master said. I leaned back, resting on my elbows, and moved my legs to the sides, amazed for a moment at how flexible I was. In the end, my legs were parrallell with the desk. I was doing a split. And I was completely exposed for my Masters gaze. I reddened with embarrasment. It didn&#39;t become any better when he told me to touch myself. I slowly slid a finger over my clit, and it sent bolts of electricity through my pelvis. I let a finger slide inside myself, meeting no resistance, and started slowly moving it in and out. &quot;Too small,&quot; I thought to myself. And looked down at his cock. And yet I moaned. More for his pleasure than from my own touch. I returned to my clit, trying to relieve my extreme arousal. I rubbed myself, and soon felt myself close to orgasming again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! You&#39;re not to come yet. Spread your lips for me. Expose your pussy even more.&quot; I did as I was told. &quot;Now sit up. Look down at your cunt. I want you to watch as my cock slides in.&quot; My gaze fixed on the head of his dick, inches from my pussy. He moved in, slid it up and down between my lips a few times, and then placed it at my opening. It looked so huge. A tinge of fear - would it hurt? Would he rip me in half? - crossed my mind, but I was too horny to care. I desperately wanted him inside me. But he just kept it there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beg.&quot;<br />
<br />
Driven mad by desire, I wasn&#39;t hard to ask. I said all the most humiliating things I could imagine, trying to convince him to do me. &quot;Please, Sir. Please fuck me. I want you inside me. I want you to fill me up, to use me. I want your thick, hard, beautiful cock sliding in and out of me. Fucking me hard. I want you to fill me with your come. And I want to feel that come slide out of me, running down my legs. afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, he started to slide inside me. I saw his head disappear inside, felt him filling me up. I was so wet, there was no resistance. It was almost painful, but at the same time, it was just what I wanted. What I needed. Inch by inch, my tight pussy welcomed him. This alien feeling of being filled up, having something slide inside me where I should have had a cock. It drove me mad, with desire, with humiliation, with pleasure. Slavegirls were conditioned to be extremely sensitive, hypersexual, with a need to please their Masters. I was a slavegirl. I was my Masters fuck-toy, to be used as he saw fit. My pleasure was unimportant, a tool for my compliance, but when he used me, it was almost guaranteed. That thought brought me even more pleasure.<br />
<br />
I was almost disappointed when he was finally all the way in. I was still looking down, as I had been ordered, at the place where our two bodies joined. At the base of his thick cock. The humiliating sight of his member all the way inside me was one of the sexiest I had ever seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel, slut, to have your cunt filled up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still looking down, mesmerized, I answered him. &quot;It feel... it feels beyond words, Sir. This slavegirl thanks you for using her like this. Of making her expose herself, and watch herself. Now, please, Sir, fuck me.&quot; He wasted no time, quickly getting up to a considerable speed. His dick going in and out of me. I felt a pressure starting to build, like I was about to pee myself. *Was* I about to pee myself? I hoped not, as embarrassing as that would have been. The pressure grew stronger. &quot;Please, please, please, be a squirting orgasm,&quot; I whispered to myself, biting my lip hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you about to come?&quot; I just nodded, moaned. &quot;I will count to ten. Do not come before I say so.&quot; He started counting. The pressure grew more and more. I was holding back all I could, starting to scream. &quot;Oh fuck, oh God, fuck, no, fuck, fuck, please! &quot;...and ten. Come for me.&quot; And I did. It started in my pussy, contractions, squeezing his dick. Liquid squirted out of me. The spasms spread. I started trashing on the desk, everything else but the pleasure dimming. He continued fucking me, gripping my hips. as I came and came, squirting him wet. And then, as my orgasm was fading, I felt him harden even more, and his pace quickened. I knew what was next. I felt him twitch inside me, felt him come. The first load he deposited deep inside me. The second came as he pulled out, flying up and landing on my tummy. He plunged in, went deep, and I wrapped my legs around him, pressing him even deeper. Having been him, I knew he liked that. He spasmed a few more times, stayed there a little while. As he pulled out, he said to me, &quot;You know you&#39;re going to have to clean me up, coming like that? My trousers are soaked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir, I know,&quot; I answered, breathing heavily, lying down on his desk, resting. Enjoying aftershocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl. First, my little slave, I want you to describe for me how that felt. How did it feel to be fucked. To be used. To orgasm as a woman. As a slave girl... Dave.&quot;</p>
