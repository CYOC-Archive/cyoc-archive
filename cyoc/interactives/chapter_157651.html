<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Mason let out a long, deep, content sigh, pressing his new toy’s head to his chest as his eyes went to the mirror as well. He stood a good foot taller than her, which came as no surprise to him. His whole life he had been quite tall, but before he acquired his own pen, he was only ever able to dream of being the specimen he is now. Not that his toy would ever know that. All that she cared about, seemingly, was taking cock. Of course, there was then the thought of her finding another man in need. He knew that she would, without a second thought, drop to her knees for someone else’s cock. No, that wouldn’t do. To top it off, while he was absolutely aroused by the sight of her glossy, ebony form, it felt… too monotonous. <br />
<br />
	Jean looked up at her Master as she felt him pull away from their embrace, her face taking a slightly more neutral, yet still happy expression. She wished she could ask him if he enjoyed that as much as she did. She wished she could tell her Master how much she loved his cock inside of her. She wished she could tell him how much she loved this form. Alas, words failed her as she made a vain attempt to speak, making no noise as her plump, black lips moved to speak. Noticing this, Mason gave a deep chuckle at her. <br />
<br />
	“Got something to say, slut?” He asked, sending absolutely euphoric shiver down the doll’s spine. Jean never truly imagined herself to be the submissive type, but this recent experience had shattered that expectation of herself. <br />
<br />
	Mason let go of her fully, and stepped back, looking his work over. He hadn’t made any severe mental changes thus far, aside from ensuring that she would be as lusty for cock as she could be. Part of that seemed to entail a natural submissiveness it seemed. His lips curled into a light smirk as a few ideas came to mind. He went to the desk and fished one of the pens out of his coat pocket, and pulled a notepad forward. He didn’t write anything yet, though. There was something that needed to be tested. <br />
<br />
	“Let’s see what you know…” Mason mused, leaning his naked hips against the side of the desk, and folding his arms. Without any further words, he pointed two fingers down at the floor in front of him. <br />
<br />
	Jean simply looked at his gesture, and while not immediately knowing what to do, put two and two together. She quickly made her way to the area he pointed down at, and knelt, sitting down on her knees, but keeping upright and looking up at Mason. This garnered a soft chuckle from her Master. <br />
<br />
	“A for effort, but not close enough. Well, let’s fix that now.” He commented, which made Jean feel a pang of shame. What did she do wrong? Was she not fast enough? Did she make eye contact when she wasn’t supposed to? That had to be it.<br />
<br />
	None of those things were wrong, however. Jean simply didn’t know what Mason did, which were the gestures he used, as well as how to properly kneel. That was easily fixed however. Picking up his pen, Mason scribbled a few lines of text on the notepad. ‘Jean knows basic slave protocol’ and ‘Jean knows how to kneel properly’. The moment the second line was finished, Jean adjusted her posture. She shifted her heels so that her toes were touching together, before sitting back on her heels. Her face scrunched up into a light wince as she felt the strain of kneeling like this for the first time. Her ankles were in agony, but after adjusting her posture again so that she was sitting up a bit more, the discomfort was lessened, but not entirely gone. <br />
<br />
	Once Mason saw her rest her hands on her thighs with her palms facing up, he smiled down at her and stroked her hair in praise. Her Master leaned down to her ear, giving it gentle bite and tug before growling into it. <br />
<br />
	“Good girl~...”<br />
<br />
	Jean shuddered, and felt herself go moist at those two words alone. <br />
<br />
	“We have more changes to make before you’re my perfect slave,” He added before standing back up, “Stand in front of the mirror. I want you to see what happens to your body.”<br />
<br />
	With as little hesitation as possible- only due to her ankles hurting- Jean got up and moved to the mirror, standing in front of it as ordered.</p>
