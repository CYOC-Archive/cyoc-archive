<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a little after one in the afternoon when Agent Theodore Green arrived at the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office. He he had made fairly good progress with the high volume of work that would be needed to Lionel Ulysses, but even there, he had a lot of work still to do. They had leads, but they weren&#39;t very specific. He knew that Ulysses met with a gang every Sunday, or that it was likely that he did, and that these meetings occurred in Seattle. However, he didn&#39;t know which gang, exactly when these meetings took place, and where they took place. He would need the cooperation of the Seattle Police in order to get a lot of that information to even set up a possible sting operation. <br />
<br />
After parking car he walked quietly into the building to check on how the those in the Field Office had done with regard to getting the Seattle Police to cooperate with the investigation. He had a slight bit of confidence as he noted an unmarked police car in a visitor&#39;s parking space, which he assumed was from the Seattle Police Department. Theodore hoped that meant good news that would helpfully make things easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Green?&quot; a voice asked to him, shortly after he shut the back agent entrance to the building.<br />
<br />
Agent Green turned to see a young female agent standing there in the back entry near door that would lead into a small conference room that was near the back entrance. She looked a bit nervous and as though she was checking every time that backdoor opened in case it was Agent Green. Theodore could see this by her wide eyes and tight lipped grimace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I been keeping you, Agent Peters?&quot; Theodore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, sir,&quot; Agent Nicole Peters one of the Seattle agents spoke carefully, &quot;but we had some developments while you were out, and I&#39;ve been instructed to inform you the moment you returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore blinked and then nodded, realizing that this likely had to do with whether or not the Seattle Police would cooperate in the efforts to catch Lionel Ulysses. He had after all given that base instruction to the Seattle agents when he&#39;d first arrived in Seattle at around ten AM. And in the time it had taken him to drive to Moon Lake and get the leads from Lionel Ulysses&#39; background information and then drive back to Seattle, Theodore hoped that would mean they got some cooperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have we made any progress with the Seattle PD?&quot; Theodore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and quite good progress, actually,&quot; Agent Peters nodded and actually bowed and gestured into the door she was standing by, &quot;If you will...&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore calmly walked toward the door and entered to find the head of the Seattle Field Office standing at the long polished wood table with a couple of book boxes setting on end with a host of papers filling up the top of the desk. Theodore also noted that the AC&#39;s fan had been turned down so as not to disturb the papers that were placed on the desk. The head of the Seattle Field Office was also a female agent, but older. She was older than Agent Peters and well older than Theodore. Her hair was cut short and she wore a dark brown woman&#39;s business suit. She looked and carried herself with a great deal of dignity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Agent Green,&quot; she spoke, &quot;it is good you&#39;ve returned, as we&#39;ve gotten the cooperation you requested with regard to your case.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Seattle Field Office directer stepped back and gestured to two plain clothes detectives from the Seattle Police Department. One was in black while the other was in gray and both had their police shields clipped to the front of their belts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Detective Francis Smith,&quot; the Detective in black spoke slowly and offered his hand to Agent Green, &quot;this is my partner, Detective Watson Holmes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will leave you three to your work, as this is your case,&quot; the Seattle Field Office director spoke,&quot;though, Agent Peters will remain as my liaison while you&#39;re in my field office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Director Cummings,&quot; Theodore spoke to her and then turned back to Detectives Smith and Watson, &quot;and I thank you for agreeing to cooperate with us. Catching Ulysses will benefit both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the requests we got from the field office here took our department a bit by surprise,&quot; Detective Smith admitted while looking down, &quot;we&#39;ve had a host of issues with Lionel Ulysses... at least regarding behavior that we&#39;ve suspected of  him... but the man has proven to be extra-ordinarily slippery. It&#39;s like he&#39;s always figured out a way to escape. And he&#39;s never seemed to stay around in anyone spot for long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But because most of what we can prove are drug and gang related, we didn&#39;t have much that would really be a call for the FBI,&quot; Detective Holmes grumbled, &quot;we&#39;ve gotten some help from the highway patrol and Washington State&#39;s sheriff&#39;s departments... and even some cooperation with the Federal Marshals, but... that&#39;s all been slow going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore nodded. Lionel Ulysses had given plenty of law enforcement agencies the slip and had even kept a low enough profile in Moon Lake that their police department couldn&#39;t waste officers pursuing Ulysses. That issue would surely lead to consternation on all parties involved, particularly as the reason Lionel Ulysses always seemed able to get away was the fact that as a were-beast he could either hear officers coming or catch their scent before they got close to him. However, Theodore knew he couldn&#39;t let them know about the true nature of the target.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he&#39;s managed to move through a lot of different circles,&quot; Theodore spoke, &quot;until he recently murdered a US Marine in Virginia. Murder of a member of the military fit in to give us room to lay claim to jurisdiction on the case. Particularly as he LEFT the base after committing the crime. If we cooperate together, we&#39;ll get an opportunity to catch him and put him away for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And lump all the charges together,&quot; Detective Smith nodded, &quot;maybe together we can put together something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the request for information on gang activity was also a bit of a surprise,&quot; Detective Watson commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... to start to connect some dots, I can share with you on some things that I&#39;ve uncovered that may help,&quot; Theodore spoke and then slowly began to explain what he had learned about his past in Moon Lake. It included the misdemeanors that had been committed in Moon Lake and what he&#39;d gotten from Ulysses&#39; parents. Both detectives nodded as they listened and then blinked heavily as Theodore spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake... so that&#39;s where he went to hide,&quot; Detective Smith commented, &quot;but that&#39;s a pretty small town out in the sticks. I&#39;m not sure even every state map has Moon Lake on it... surely they would have known he was a wanted man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I know, they do,&quot; Theodore said slowly, &quot;but he&#39;s managed to keep a low enough profile that they didn&#39;t always notice his comings and goings.  And he might not have even stayed there long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But these parents couldn&#39;t report what gang or specifically where?&quot; Detective Holmes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but if you want him for various drug related offenses... among others,&quot; Theodore commented, &quot;surely you&#39;ve noticed him from time to time... or at least noticed when gang groups are congregating every Sunday for meetings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Detective Smith and Detective Holmes both nodded and began to look over the paperwork, which Theodore Green noted were all case reports and photographs. Eventually they came onto one  that had the words &quot;rat pack&quot; written on the outside of the manila folder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Off of the top of my head, this group would be the only one that has been noted to meet every Sunday,&quot; Detective Holmes commented, &quot;though they&#39;re the toughest...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toughest?&quot; Theodore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only five known members in the gang,&quot; Detective Smith answered, &quot;and they&#39;ve seemed to work with nearly every other gang in the state... but don&#39;t fully know all the connections... or even where they meet, as it&#39;s never in the same place each time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any pattern?&quot; Theodore asked, &quot;such as the parts of the city and who specifically comes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More often than not... in our warehouse district, but from some reports... never the same one,&quot; Detective Holmes commented, &quot;and these reports are old, so we aren&#39;t getting a real shot at pin pointing down which one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may simply need a sweep of the entire warehouse district,&quot; Theodore sighed heavily, &quot;let the owners know that we have a major suspect using them as a base of operations... possibly even his meeting place. Many of those that are active won&#39;t want a crook in there and those that aren&#39;t &quot;active&quot; may not complain so long as we don&#39;t bring the building down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming they have nothing to hide themselves,&quot; Detective Holmes commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that would require a massive amount of work... and likely including SWAT and whatever units the FBI can add,&quot; Detective Smith replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can offer a few agents from the Field Office to help with all control and coordination efforts,&quot; Agent Peters spoke up, &quot;and given that other law enforcement agencies have been involved... we might be able to get them together for a planned sweep of the area tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if what you have is accurate,&quot; Theodore commented, &quot;we&#39;ll be able to put Ulysses behind bars for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fear that Theodore had that Ulysses would use Moon Lake&#39;s secret to blackmail them floated in the back of his head, as that would come back to hurt Marci while he wasn&#39;t near her to protect her. There was also the fear that Ulysses might be able to slip through the net that was being laid. Now, while Moon Lake may have been a fallback spot for him in the past, Theodore doubted that Ulysses would go back there when the Moon Lake Police had been warned about the threat that Lionel Ulysses posed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he&#39;s even here,&quot; Detective Smith gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he&#39;s here,&quot; Theodore assured him, &quot;or at least he&#39;s in the state, based on our ability to track known cards and transactions connected to him. The fact that he&#39;s come across the country would have to mean he is hooking up with his pals tomorrow. If we can get the men arranged and coordinated for it... we can bring a guy we both want to justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both detectives nodded. Things might not be easy, but in a way, they&#39;d at least come farther than they had before with regards to catching Lionel Ulysses.</p>
