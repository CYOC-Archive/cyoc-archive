<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The shower room was steamy and had a thick heavy odor of sweat and men. Vincent didn’t mind the smell, he found, which surprised him. Maybe he was finally getting used to it after spending so much time with Carter and at the gym? Carter was already under one of the thick shower sprays, scrubbing his hairy muscular body with a bar of soap. Carter was unashamed and his huge cock was wide open for Vincent to see. Vincent, still cupping his privates and very embarrassed about his smaller size, picked a shower on the opposite side. He was hopeful that the thick steam would hide most of his body from Carter. <br />
<br />
Vincent turned the water on and the hot spray hit his upper body and head. He was lost in a cloud of steam and hot water. It felt so relaxing and good on his tired, sore muscles. He closed his eyes and just stood there for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
After several moments, Vincent grabbed a communal bar of soap and began to wash the sweat off of himself. While he was soaping himself up, he noticed a few thick and dark chest hairs sprouting in the center of his chest! What?! He had never had a single hair on his chest before. Huh, he must still be hitting puberty! He also noticed a thick, but sparse, line of brown hairs leading from his belly button down to his pubes, which also seemed a bit thicker. He shrugged it off; sometimes guys got hairier as they aged, so it wasn’t totally unusual, he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Vincent was in the middle of soaping up his pits when he heard a soft, wet slapping sound behind him. He turned but got water in his eye so he couldn’t see anything. By the time he cleared his eyes, he began to hear deep grunts as well as the slapping noise. When Vincent finally saw it, he was shocked. Carter was just a few feet behind him, under his own shower spray. Except, Carter was openly and aggressively beating off! Vincent gasped at the sight! Carter had to be almost 11 inches, and he was as hard as a steel pipe. His massive hands were pumping up and down the huge length. Carter’s hairy arm had vein popping up on it and his massive biceps were flexing as he beat his meat. Carter’s eyes were closed and he looked lost in the sensations. “oh fuck…” he softly muttered to no one.<br />
<br />
“Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!”, Vincent stammered, shocked. Carter opened his eyes and looked at Vincent. Without ceasing to pump his meat, he say, while stifling moans and groans; “Uhn… What does it look like…. Ohhh fuuuck…. It’s not a big deal bro… Uhhnn… All the other guys do it to… After a big pump us bros are always horned up… Gotta drain your balls after… You can jack off too if you want bro, I don’t care!”…<br />
<br />
Carter closed his eyes and went back to concentrating fully on beating off. His other hands, which was trailing through his hairy chest, runs down his torso and cups his huge hairy balls. He begins to knead them as he furiously beats off with his other hand.<br />
<br />
Vincent is horrified and wants to get out of the shower and away from seeing his new bro like this. But Vincent looked down and was even more shocked. He saw his member rapidly swelling up and becoming rock hard, too. Seeing Carter like this was making him incredibly horny. Within seconds, his 5 inch member was throbbing hard and he was so turned on. Fuck, it was true, he wanted to masturbate right now, too! What was going on? He was straight and now this is the second time Carter has given him a boner! Vincent wanted to run as fast as he could from the showers, but he wanted to just beat off and watch Carter so bad. His eyes trailed up and down Carter’s beefy, hairy body. And that cock, too. Carter’s head was back, his mouth open, his eyes closed, and he was softly moaning. He looked very close to climax. Vincent’s cock throbbed again, precum dribbling on the floor. His cock was begging to be touched and pumped. He was the most turned on he has ever been, he thinks. He can’t help but think what it may look like for Carter to blow his load. “I bet he can shoot so much cum”, he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Vincent looks down at his cock, battling conflicting emotions and new hormones racing through him. Should he get out of there? It would be so easy to just give in a beat off……</p>
