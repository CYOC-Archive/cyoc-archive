<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So, what do you think, babe,” Mark asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Zoey” looks at the man, sighing mentally, ‘what’s the worst that could happen,’ he thinks to himself, he then forces a smile, “why not,” he then says, trying to keep his voice calm.<br />
<br />
Mark beams, “sweet, let me get on the phone and book a room,” he says, taking out his phone, “why don’t you start packing?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods, “sure,” she says, walking out of the room, her head buzzing, ‘what the fuck have I gotten myself into,’ Jeff thinks to himself, he is so wound up, that he had totally forgotten that he had left his computer and the program running.<br />
<br />
But luckily for him, Mark doesn’t notice it, when his “wife” left the room, the man dials the number of the resort. However as he waits for someone to answer, Mark notices that Jeff’s computer is running, the man sighs and shakes his head, “that boy,” he mumbles, before simply closing the opened program, without taking a closer look, and turns off the computer, then heads out of the room as someone answers the other line.<br />
<br />
Soon Jeff finds himself sitting next to his dad in the passenger seat in his dad’s car, the lights of the city rapidly fading behind the horizon as they drive along the highway and towards their destination. The former 16-year-old boy can’t help but feel extremely nervous, still wondering if it was a smart idea, but he also knows that it’s to late to back out, all he can do is try to survive the weekend, hoping that nothing… weird will happen.<br />
<br />
Mark notices that Zoey seems to be pretty tensed, ‘she can try to hide it from me, but I can tell that she is pretty tensed up about something,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I’d like to ask her what is troubling her, but I know how she is when she’s in this state, she won’t want to tell me or talk about it’. The man continues to drive as he continues to find a solution, ‘I really don’t want her mood to ruin our romantic weekend,’ he continues to think, ‘this might be a good opportunity to test out that App I have stumbled upon today. I’ll just use it to calm her nerves and make her feel more relaxed, once that’s done, maybe I’ll show her the app and we could have some fun, or, to make it more interesting, I’ll not share it with her and simply try a few things without her knowing!’<br />
<br />
Jeff meanwhile is still battling with himself, unaware of what the man, his dad, is thinking about, ‘I shouldn’t have transformed myself into my mom,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘I mean, she… now I am a straight woman… but, since I have my normal mind, I should be able to control my body’s feeling and urges. Besides, I doubt dad is planning to have sex with his “wife”, a romantic trip does not have to include sex’. However, Jeff is unable to calm himself, the fear of exactly the opposite of happening is extremely strong, the former teen really feels sick to his stomach, at the thought of failing to control his body’s feeling and urges, that they might override his rational thinking and cause him to land in bed with his own dad. A horrifying scenario for Jeff, imagining his dad fucking HIM while he’s in the body of his mother, it would be so humiliating and disgusting.<br />
<br />
After a six hour drive, they finally arrive at their destination, a breathtaking resort in the middle of a forest somewhere in Florida. The resort is made up of a large main building, which has a restaurant, indoor pool and the receptionist, the “rooms” are actually separate medium sized log lodges, which look like small hunting lodges, each with its own private man-made lake at the back of the lodge, each lodge surrounded by forest, which provides extra privacy.<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t help but feel stunned, the “woman’s” eyes widen when they reach their lodge, inside the lodge, the interior is subtle: a large living room, which also has the dining room and open kitchen, a large open fireplace and stairs leading up to the bed room. Since they were only by themselves, without children, they got the smallest lodge on the site.<br />
<br />
Mark smiles as he watches his wife take in the place they would be staying the next two days, “so, babe. What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“It… it’s absolutely breathtaking,” “Zoey” replies, ‘now I am even more tensed seeing how… secluded and private this lodge is,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘the lodges are so far apart, plus all are surrounded by forest, no one would be able to hear me scream!’<br />
<br />
As Jeff walks around the lodge, taking everything in, he doesn’t notice his dad pulling out his phone, ‘time to calm her nerves,’ the man thinks to himself, opening the Chronivac-app he had downloaded earlier that day and activates the scanner, scanning himself and the “woman” he believes to be his wife, unaware that “she” is his son Jeff.<br />
<br />
Since Mark’s app is independent it is no surprise that after scanning himself and Jeff, that one file has “Mark Davis” and one with “Zoey Davis” written bellow it. And when Mark opens “Zoey’s” file, this is what he sees:<br />
<br />
Name: Zoey Davis<br />
Gender: female<br />
Species: human<br />
Race: caucasian<br />
Age: 41<br />
Body: average<br />
Hair color and style: mid-back length, black, ponytail<br />
Eye color: green<br />
Chest: 38C<br />
Height: 5 feet 2 inches<br />
Weight: 132 lbs<br />
Mood: tensed, nervous<br />
Fertile: no<br />
Sexual orientation: straight<br />
Relationship status: married to Mark Davis<br />
Siblings: Darren 30-year-old brother, Melanie 50-year-old sister<br />
Children: Jeff Davis 16-year-old, Henry 10-year-old, Hanna 18-year-old<br />
Occupation: Arts and math teacher at Lennon High School<br />
Awareness: off<br />
<br />
Mark, unaware that the woman is his son, changes her mood from tensed and nervous to calm and relaxed, he also changes her fertile stats from “no” to “yes”, grinning to himself, the 45-year-old always dreamt of having at least one more child. The man looks up at his wife, who is currently looking at a magazine, smiling to himself when he presses the confirmation button, his smile widens when he notices the immediate change in his wife’s posture: her body seems suddenly more relaxed and a smile appears on her face, “looks like you are starting to feel a lot better,” Mark says, putting his phone away.<br />
<br />
What makes matters worse, the change has no affect on Jeff’s Chronivac, the countdown, to when he’ll be transforming back into his normal self, continues to run, since the two programs aren’t linked to each other, neither of them are “aware” of the other and continue to work independently from each other.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” looks up from the magazine, smiling, “yeah, I do,” she says, “I don’t know why I felt so nervous and tensed, sorry about that”.<br />
<br />
Mark chuckles, walking up to the woman, “don’t worry about it,” he says, “I’ve noticed how stressed and tensed you have been the last days. I believe it’s because you work to much”.<br />
<br />
“Probably,” the “woman” says, ‘something doesn’t feel right, but I can’t put my finger on it,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘it’s probably nothing and simply the relaxing atmosphere of this place that causes me to feel so at ease. I think… I think I’ll enjoy spending two days with dad here, I really deserve a break’.<br />
<br />
Mark smiles, placing his hands on the “woman’s” hips, “you deserve a break,” he says, “let’s get our stuff unpacked and explore the site, maybe take a walk through the forest?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles, seeming not bothered by the man’s hands on her hips, which feels strangely normal to the “woman”, “sure, sounds good to me, hun,” she says without thinking.</p>
