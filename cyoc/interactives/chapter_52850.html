<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Across town in a hotel room Richard Moss was just finishing reading an email that got sent to him by accident. He didn't mean to open it but there had been a noise outside his room which caused him to jump and thus tapping the touchpad on his laptop to open it. It was for Justin Stanton from his uncle. The program that had automatically installed was suppose to change reality and reading what it said about him he was willing to believe it. Justin's uncle said to use the program to recruit new Defenders. Rick had seen the Defenders in action once while he was here. He wouldn't mind joining them since he was tired of his humdrum life. He looked over his information again.<br />

Rick looked over his changes again then pressed &quot;enter&quot;. A pop-up appeared asking for a time limit. At first Rick selected &quot;forever&quot; but after reading the warning went back and selected one year. He could always change the time limit later. Another pop-up came up asking if he wanted to be aware of the reality change. He clicked &quot;Yes&quot; and then it asked if he wanted to have new memories along with his old ones and he again clicked &quot;Yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then the changes started. He began to shrink and finding that his clothes were becoming loose on him he took them off. By the time he had taken his clothes off he had gone from 5'8&quot; to 4'11&quot;. Of course he still looked like he was 36 but that was about to change as he started to regress. His hair grew out to a short cut and the belly he had gotten over the years quickly deflated. His body hair all but disappeared leaving only a couple stray hairs here and there. He knew he was twelve now and looked forward to the next changes which didn't take long to start. He felt a tingling as his hair grew longer. He was able to pull some to the front and watch it grow in fascination. Once it had grown to about waist length it change color from brown to strawberry blonde. He went over to a mirror in the room to witness the final transformation. He watched as his body slimmed and became athletic. He watched as his dick and balls shrank to nothing leaving a featureless groin which didn't last long as the area between his legs puffed out a bit and then split. He was now a she where it counted. Smiling he watched as his nipples and areolas grew and then the flesh underneath grew out into small mounds and stopped at a AA cup. He watched his face rearrange in the mirror giving him a very pretty face. The last thing to change on him was his eyes went from hazel to blue. He was ecstatic that it had work. He went back to his bed and grabbed his laptop just as the world began to blur and spin. New memories were pouring into his mind. When the world stopped spinning he found himself in a different place fully clothed just as four boys came in. She recognized them as Justin, Charles, Michael, and Colin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have the briefing ready Beth?&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now when have you known me not to have a briefing ready?&quot; Beth asked jokingly. She grew serious and said, &quot;Remember Colin that what you see and hear here goes no further than this room. If you can't keep it a secret then you need to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Beth,&quot; Justin said rolling his eyes. &quot;He hasn't said anything about us being Defenders to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just like to be cautious,&quot; Beth said holding her hand up. &quot;If anyone found out your parents would be in danger. But enough of that. Take your seats and I'll begin the briefing.&quot; Once they did she tapped a few buttons on her laptop and the room darkened and an image of a balding man with red hair, beard, and mustache appeared on a screen. &quot;This is Dr. James McKnoll,&quot; she said pointing at the screen. &quot;He lives in Toronto or he did. Last night at 11 o'clock neighbors heard a commotion at his house. When the police arrived they found him and his wife dead and their two year old son critically wounded. Their eight year old daughter is missing and it's presumed that whoever killed Mr. and Mrs. McKnoll abducted her. Here's some photos of the crime scene.&quot; A series of photos showing what looked like bodies that were twisted in so many different ways that it was difficult to see who they were. A few photos showed a close-up of some wounds that looked to be caused by a large animal. &quot;Dr. McKnoll was working on an above top secret space program to enable ordinary humans to travel between the stars. It's believed that someone wants to stop this program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why take his daughter though?&quot; Charles asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The theory is that they took her to use as leverage to shut down the program,&quot; Beth said tapping a few keys and bringing a photo of a girl up. &quot;Her name is Melissa Ann McKnoll. She's 4'2&quot; and weighs 59 pounds. She has red hair and green eyes. She has a birthmark in the shape of a crescent moon on the back of her right hand and one in the shape of a cat on her inner left thigh close to her groin. She has a weak bladder and so she has to wear diapers. It's our mission to find her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is this a job for you guys?&quot; Colin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because of the way Mr. and Mrs. McKnoll were killed,&quot; Beth said and went back to a few of the photos. &quot;As you can see the wounds on their bodies indicate a large animal attacked them. The way their bodies are twisted indicates someone with great strength. These two factors point in the direction of some type of were-creature committing this crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When do we leave?&quot; Justin asked smiling.</p>
