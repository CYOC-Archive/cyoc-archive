<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Ty heard his father close the door to his room and then cross the few feet to the Master bedroom, he heard the unmistakeable sound of the front door opening and closing and Ty was brought back for just a moment to the reality that Mark and June still existed and needed to be dealt with in order to keep this new family from falling apart. To be frank, Mark and June had shown themselves to be piss-poor parents, so putting either of them into positions where they would be parents in this new scenario was completely out of the question as far as Ty was concerned. Dustin was already everything Ty wanted from a Dad, and bringing Mark and June back into the equation would just ruin everything that Ty had mad true... unless of course Mark and June could be shown the error of their parenting ways by Dustin.<br />
<br />
The easiest thing would be to make June Dustin&#39;s wife, make her pregnant with Mark, and completely overwrite her personality, but even if Ty did just that, he&#39;d remember each and every time he looked at June just how bad his life used to be. No, the only thing was to make them both Dustin&#39;s kids, but that still left room for a mother... which before June and Mark could become Dustin&#39;s kids, they could supply a new mom for the family.<br />
<br />
Coming up with an intricate series of wishes as June and Mark took off their coats and hung them up, Ty made it so that they wouldn&#39;t notice any of the changes to reality until they&#39;d completed what little they were left useful for, the creation of new mother. Ty wished that the new daughter that they were about to conceive would be as genetically different from Dustin as humanly possible. The other thing he wished was that Dustin and Ty&#39;s new brothers wouldn&#39;t recognize or wake up to hear what June and Mark were about to do. And so Mark and June began to disrobe as a sudden wave of horniness washed over them both. Ty, wished himself invisible again and snuck out of his room and onto the stair landing where he could lean over and watch as Mark and June began to tear their clothes off of one another until they were naked enough and they fell onto the couch as June began to ride Mark until they both came, causing Mark and June to collapse in total exhaustion with June rolling off of Mark and rather clumsily onto the carpeted floor of the living room. Already Ty can notice that the next wish he had made was starting to kick in as her belly began to slowly stretch and expand at a much more rapid rate for a pregnancy, but slow enough for June to barely register as she fell asleep in the afterglow the last bit of sex she will be having for quite a long time, and she joined the already sleeping Mark in a post coital slumber.<br />
<br />
Soon after she had fallen asleep, June&#39;s belly fast forwarded through months of pregnancy, racing through them at an accelerated rate. The next wish kicked into effect as June remained unconscious as she gave birth to a baby girl who was about as genetically different from Dustin as humanly possible for June and Mark to conceive--something which would correct itself even more as the baby was magically cleaned, her umbilical cord was cut from June and she began to grow older.<br />
<br />
It was here that the changes to Mark and June began to appear once again as they began to regress in age as their new daughter--soon to be mother--would grow older. For every year that Mark and June lost, the baby, Jen--would grow 5 months older from each year they lost. Ty had estimated that Mark and June had been about 40 if not a little older than that. This way Jen would become older, but not older than Dustin.<br />
<br />
In reality, Mark had been 38 while June had been 34, so that would equal 72 years total between them, and with Jen taking 5 months of each of those years, she&#39;d end up being just on the bridge between 29 and 30--and just the perfect age for being Dustin&#39;s wife and the mother to Ty and the rest--having been 18 going on 19 when she had Ty, so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Newborn baby Jen laid on June&#39;s engorged stomach as she whimpered for milk. Ty subconsciously wished for her to be able to find June&#39;s breasts to help ease the process along. As if guided along by unseen hands, Jen found herself nudged in the direction of where June&#39;s filled breasts eagerly awaited their new baby to suckle. It was this action which initiated the beginning of the age transfer.<br />
<br />
The first noticeable change came from June as her belly undid the changes which pregnancy had brought it as a whole year was stripped from her. Jen seemed to take on the mass that June had lost as she grew to ten months old. June&#39;s breasts remained with milk for the transformation to continue... for now.<br />
<br />
Penny continued to suckle and grow, draining age away from both Mark and June. Once she was 30 months old, or 2 and a half years old, she found June&#39;s one breast was empty and had to switch to the other for the last of the milk June&#39;s body had prepared for her. June&#39;s other breast was completely emptied of breast milk when Jen had reached 60 months or 5 years old. Both Mark and June were now 6 years younger, looking more in their prime at 32 and 28 respectively. Jen, curious as to why she was sitting on June&#39;s chest, got up and tried to wake Mark and June--though neither were able to be roused, Jen tried all the same as more age continued to flow from Mark and June and into Jen. By the time she&#39;d given up on waking up either, another 6 years were gone from Mark and June making them 26 and 22, making Jen 10 and about to begin puberty.<br />
<br />
Jen began to shoot up in height, growing taller like Mark had, while her breasts slowly formed buds and then began to blossom out into fully rounded ample breasts that slowly edged from A to B cup as she took another sixty months, transforming her into a 15 year old. Her hips began to widen as the first signs of her womanly figure began to appear, and along with that, her fingers, curious at first as to the changes that puberty were bringing her, slowly slid her hands over her breasts and then down her body and to her developing sex, where they began to explore and rub her own crevices, her moans transitioning from soprano to alto the longer she went.<br />
<br />
As Jen aged, Mark and June began to dwindle, going from full grown adults to more a lean college aged youth of 20 and his teen sweet 16 sweetheart. At this point June and Jen looked like they could be fully sisters if not fraternal twins, given Jen&#39;s obvious height difference. The age however continued to flow as the changes were about halfway done at this point. Jen continued to blossom fully into the category of woman, her Bs enlarging into Cs if not CCs, with her having the back and lower body muscles to help support and give proportion to her body. Her long wavy raven hair was loose and hung down to about the middle of her back, and a gorgeous 20 year old adult woman and who Ty looked at and felt some familial connection as he recognized her as &quot;mother&quot; in the back of his mind. His mother who was doing something naughty, he recognized as her fingers continued to push her closer and closer to the edge of orgasm.<br />
<br />
June had completely left her teenage years behind her as puberty undid itself, growing smaller and more undeveloped until she was as smooth and flat as Jen had been a few minutes ago--also aged 10 now. Mark himself had undergone a reverse of puberty for the large part, for while his 14 year old body still clung to some sprinkling of hair and lankiness, his muscles and even a good bit of his height had been undone as more age left his body, and it wasn&#39;t yet finished. He looked like a more gangly version of Dustin, truth be told.<br />
<br />
Mother finished herself off by the time she had aged to 25 and her breasts had swollen to Ds as they were heavy with milk from nursing her baby boys that were upstairs--though not the babies she was thinking of them as. As she recovered, Jen took stock of the children around her. Her baby girl, just 4 years old and sweet and cute. Jen scooped up her shrinking daughter and began to rock her in her arms. Mark was now all boy at 8 years old, and sweet and prepubescent looking as he snuggled up on the couch, grabbing a pillow which was now much larger than it had been compared to him before, and hugging it like he would a teddy bear and looking rather adorable doing so. <br />
<br />
As June continued to grow more infantile and smaller in Jen&#39;s arms, she began fumble around with Jen&#39;s breasts, eventually latching on and beginning to suckle from her new mother. This led to the reverse of the transformation appearance from earlier, now it looked like with each suckle, Jen began to gain more weight as her stomach began to grow and her womb readied itself for its new occupants. Soon, June was shrunk down to the age of a newborn and seemed to stop, while Mark had shrunk through grade school and straight into being a toddler of two, which Jen also scooped up and held in her arms at the same time she held June. Like June before her, Mark found his own breast and began to suckle, soon joining his former wife and soon to be sister in infancy.<br />
<br />
Just as Mark had joined June at the age of being a newborn, Jen had finished her transformation into that of a 29 year old mother who had recently given birth to fraternal twins, but the transformation of Mark and June had yet to complete as suddenly a fleshy tube came out and connected to June as she was pulled into her new mother, former daughter, until Jen was rather round with a nine month belly. Shortly thereafter, another fleshy tube came out of Jen&#39;s womb and came for Mark, pulling him in as well until he had joined June inside of Jen. Jen, exhausted and not quite feeling the pain of a full labor due to Ty&#39;s magic--though all of the exhaustion that came from it--found herself nine months pregnant with twins and on the floor--the last place any pregnant woman would wish to find herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck... I must have fallen off the couch. Dusty!&quot; called Jen and the inaudible spell being lifted, Dad or &quot;Dusty&quot; as Jen called him, came bursting out of the master bedroom and swiftly swooped down the steps at the mere sound of his wife and love of his life in need. As he did, Ty couldn&#39;t help but notice that Jen&#39;s belly was beginning to shrink--not a lot at first, but enough that she was no longer nine months pregnant and ready to give birth at any moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fell asleep after that sponge bath?&quot; asked Dustin as he moved behind Jen and helped his seven and half month pregnant wife to her feet by bending down and scooping her up from under her armpits until she could get her own feet underneath her, by which point her belly had shrunk down to a much more manageable five months.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got to be careful Jenny, don&#39;t want to lose these two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen gave Dustin a playful slap on the top of his head, which Dustin only feigned to block as he smirked, knowing what he had done as his loving wife pretended to berate him, &quot;That&#39;s for calling me Jenny! And besides, it&#39;s not like we wouldn&#39;t have an easy time replacing them if we did. I hope they&#39;re girls,&quot; said the three and a half month pregnant Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the most fertile woman in the world, my love,&quot; said Dustin suggestively as he moved his arms around his wife and protectively caressed her shrinking belly as he nuzzled her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pregnant? I hope not again... not so soon after Cody,&quot; said Jen as she lifted Dustin&#39;s head from the nuzzle and brought him in for a full blown kiss as the last of her extended belly shrunk back to more normal proportions.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you want to do this, now, with the boys all upstairs?&quot; asked Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one I&#39;d be worried about is Ty, and he&#39;s having a sleepover tonight--the rest are too young to really understand what they&#39;d see anyway,&quot; assured Jen, as she untied Dustin&#39;s night robe, leaving only his pajama pants between herself and her ultimate goal. For some reason she felt incredibly horny tonight. Ty meanwhile wondered at the fact that his invisibility and absence was explained so simply until his brain began to remember the few times after discovering his powers he&#39;d pulled that stunt where he&#39;d said he was sleeping over at a friend&#39;s house and then explored what people did when they thought he was away. Originally it&#39;d been to catch Jake pilfering his toys, but soon he&#39;d discovered his parents did a lot of things when they thought they were alone.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s pajama pants fell to the floor and his pouchy belly was on full display along with his rock hard penis. Dustin and Jen found their way to the couch, and soon found themselves too horny to think as Jen begged Dustin to fuck her, which he happily obliged to do. Sooner than either thought, Dustin &quot;came&quot; but what had really happened was that Mark and June had been unconceived, their sperm halves traveling back into Dustin&#39;s balls as he experienced the ultimate blue ball as he felt his testicles swell with the spunk that had been Mark and June.<br />
<br />
Jen was in bliss, while Dustin looked irritated if not downright annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, I didn&#39;t come,&quot; whined Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going then...&quot; muttered Jen in her own orgasmic haze, and Dustin soon was back to thrusting shortly coming thereafter as his balls emptied the spunk that they had taken on, released back to fertilize the eggs of Mark and June once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, Dusty, if you got me pregnant again... I&#39;ll murder you in the hospital,&quot; said Jen with a half-hearted laugh.<br />
<br />
Dustin, tiredly retorted, &quot;It&#39;s not the optimal time for you to get pregnant, Jen... that&#39;s why we chose to have sex in the first place tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because it isn&#39;t optimal, doesn&#39;t mean it still can&#39;t happen,&quot; said Jen, and Dustin and Jen looked at each other and burst into laughter.</p>
