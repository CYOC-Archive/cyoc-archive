<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want you to inflate us until we pop” Said Coal now very curious about this. The Kobold still didn’t quite get what was is master planning but he was glad to help with whatever it is.<br />
<br />
And so Coal guided the Kobold through the Chronivac, after a while they finished, the Kobold will inflate first but in a very special way, then Coal will inflate next. They made the process painless and for them to come back a week after Coal pops. “Master you don’t think this… machine can actually do this right?” Said the Kobold, kind of nervous since his master was being so specific with the details… “Just hit enter, you’ll see” Coal was excited and pushed the kobold to start the changes already.<br />
<br />
Coal then felt a tingling, he smiled as he noticed the sudden hard on the program was giving him, he laid on his back and while staring at the cave ceiling he swung his tail inviting the kobold to climb over him, his mighty dragon shaft already erect and waiting.<br />
<br />
“Master… I don’t think…” The little Kobold said very quietly, but his mind was betraying him, he was feeling aroused as well. “Let’s have some fun together” Said Coal and the Kobold walked towards him.<br />
<br />
When the Kobold was close enough Coal picked him up and placed him in top of his belly, just next to his draconic dick. The Kobold could already feel the heat around his master’s dick, the glorious musk, and he could not take his eyes away from the shaft. Then a very weird idea popped into the Kobold’s mind, followed by a sudden emptiness in his insides. Something inside of him was begging to be filled.<br />
<br />
The Kobold shock his head, this couldn’t be right… but the more he tried to think on anything else the more he wanted to be filled, until his tiny body can’t take it anymore and just pop. And the worst part is, that he wanted to be filled by Coal.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to ride it?” Asked Coal with a sinister grin on his face, the Kobold nodded unable to resist the urge to be filled by something. And so Coal picked him up again and with a mighty dragon claw he toyed with the little kobold cloaca, stretching it.<br />
<br />
“Master… ” The Kobold said between moans. “Just stretching you first, nothing to worry about” Said Coal noticing how small was the Kobold’s entrance, His dick could also get in the way, but he didn’t care.<br />
<br />
The Kobold had lost all common sense in his eyes, barely showing any other expressions than just lust, with his tongue sticking out of his tiny muzzle. Coal realized the hole wasn’t really stretching a lot, so he just went with it, he placed his kobold on the top of his dick, and even if he couldn’t fit the tip the Kobold was loudly moaning.<br />
<br />
“You ain’t going any further, I’m way too big for you” Said Coal, grabbing the Kobold legs and tail as he yanked him down, not actually getting any deeper but to have a good grip on him, because Coal is feeling that he is about to… cum in any moment.<br />
<br />
The Kobold was on heaven, he felt this is what he is supposed to do, in any moment his master will fill him with his divine cum, and even if he tried to do something about it he couldn’t, his master was already grabbing him by the ankles and the tail, he was meant to receive that load.<br />
<br />
“HERE IT COMES!” Yelled Coal as he felt an enormous orgasm coming, and he eyaculated inside his Kobold’s cloaca, ropes and ropes of cum filling his Kobold.<br />
<br />
The Kobold felt his belly bloating, being filled by his master’s seed was the most delightful experience ever. Not a single drop of cum was wasted as everything was getting inside, his belly inflating more and more…<br />
<br />
“OH GOD ITS NOT STOPPING!” Coal now shut his eyes closed, the pleasure was too much, loving the feeling of a constant eyaculation. But the Kobold was having the best part, his belly was so full that the cum began expanding, his arms and legs inflated as his insides were being replaced by cum, he remembered writing all these details in the machine but he could have never thought it was real.<br />
<br />
As the Cum filled his body his organs dissolved painlessly, the only thing that could not be dissolved was his skin and his brain. Soon his arms and legs were blobby, full of his master’s cum.<br />
<br />
“UGHH… I AM STILL NOT DONE!” Coal looked again at his Kobold, now enlarged by the cum churning inside him, his Kobold paws growing larger as the cum reached them.<br />
<br />
The Kobold felt the Cum everywhere, dissolving his bones, muscles… everything, His tail now was filled by his master’s cum, his hands are losing form as the fingers stretched, and even his own tiny dick grew as it was filled by cum.<br />
<br />
But then, Something sealed up, his urethra closed, and as that happened he remembered, in order for him to be filled there must not be any holes… <br />
<br />
As he felt the cum in his neck already, he noticed his earholes closing, his nostrils also grew smaller until they were sealed, then his mouth, the cum was already making his lower body a flesh balloon, and his head is next.<br />
<br />
His skull was being dissolved, teeth and his tongue as well, he closed his eyes and couldn’t open them again, as the eyeballs also dissolved in the cum.<br />
<br />
“YOU’RE SO FUCKING FULL ALREADY!” Said Coal but his Kobold could barely hear him, as if we was underwater. Soon the Kobold lost any kind of form, his skin was so stretched that he was now more like a water balloon, but without water.<br />
<br />
“YOU’RE ALMOST THERE!” Coal encouraged as he saw the Kobold skin stretching in all directions, totally filled by his own cum, and the Kobold kept growing and growing, As the skin stretched the scales fell from his body, now mostly a balloon.<br />
<br />
The pressure was too much, the Kobold felt his brain floating inside the Semen Balloon, and for some reason he was still feeling his skin stretching, tensing up. <br />
He needed this, he was about to explode, inflated by his master’s draconic cum, everything was about to collapse the skin already on its limit, the cum still filling him, and then…<br />
<br />
*POP*<br />
<br />
The Kobold literally exploded, filling the cave with so much cum and loose skin patches, his brain landing on a rock, and Coal stopped cumming shortly afterwards.<br />
“What a way to go…” Said Coal noticing the Kobold’s brain on the floor. Even if he just had the best orgasm in his life, he was still horny while looking at all this.<br />
<br />
“I cannot wait until I am the one inflating!”<br />
Then…</p>
