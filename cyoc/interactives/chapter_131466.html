<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corbin walked forward towards the second option, he didn&#39;t want any more changes. He was fine being a minotaur at the moment. He walked the middle corridor, and saw to his surprise the walls were getting more viney and less solid. In fact they are were becoming very plant-like until the entire hallway was plant matter. He looked around surprised, but kept going. <br />
<br />
Suddenly in IRL, he got a knock at his door. He looked in horror as the door unlocked. Walking through the door was his best friend John. He dropped whatever he was holding and made to scream. Corbin grabbed him and stopped him. But before he could knock him out the game suddenly beeped loudly. <br />
<br />
-Do you want to add another player-<br />
<br />
Corbin realised this was perfect, with some more help he could definitely take back these changes. &quot;There&#39;s no time to explain John...I need your help in completing this game then I&#39;ll change back&quot;.<br />
<br />
John was confused &quot;Dude...why would you want to change back&quot;. Corbin sighed loudly &quot;Just help me please&quot;. John nodded and he plugged in a second player. Unlike Corbin John didn&#39;t change. <br />
<br />
&quot;So umm what do you need help with&quot;. Corbin looked a the screen, &quot;I&#39;m not sure yet&quot;. John saw his avatar appear, it was just him in real life. Corbin sighed he wish that happened to him.  John quickly adjusted to the controls, saying they were a little stiff and they explored forward. &quot;This place...is kind of weird&quot; John said slowly. <br />
<br />
They were now in some sort of library, except the shelves were plant matter and the books were all different colours, the room was massive. John and Corbin walked over to the altar at the front of the room and John read the  inscription &quot;Observe weary travellers this fateful task. Where you must find my long lost mask. There are plenty of books to help you find it, so whatever you do don&#39;t quit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Both John and Corbin cringed at the rhyme but they listened carefully. &quot;Well umm, lets start reading&quot; John said smirking. He grabbed one of the closest books, which had a shade of dark green. He read the words on the book &quot;Weary traveller read my words but do not say them or you&#39;ll wake up the birds &quot;what birds?&quot; John said slowly. They both heard a crow, it came from the top of the room. They looked up and saw dozens of birds sleeping.<br />
<br />
Corbin indicated they had to be quiet, they both looked around, Corbin grabbed another book, this was a crimson red. He whispered &quot;Don&#39;t trust the blues, don&#39;t trust the greens or that&#39;ll mean bad news&quot;. They both looked up &quot;what does that mean...does it mean the birds aren&#39;t harmful&quot; John said quietly. <br />
<br />
Corbin shrugged &quot;Lets just stay quiet&quot;. They decided not to choose any more green or blue books. John picked up a bright yellow book &quot;The clue holder is the key and then you will be free&quot;. John slowly made his way over to the pedestal and opened it up, to his surprise he saw a button inside. Corbin walked up and looked at it &quot;I&#39;m not sure...let me just have a look at another book first&quot;. Corbin walked away. John looked down at it, he stared at the bottom hard, It seemed beautiful the way it sat there, staring back at him. It was telling him something, to push it...yes. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Corbin had grabbed one of the blue books just to see if the red one was lying &quot;Those reds and yellows, you can&#39;t trust those fellows&quot;. Corbin looked at John and saw him throw his hand down on the button &quot;No JOHN STOP!!&quot;. The button opened up the door behind John he looked around and saw the minotaur Corbin encountered before. Corbin could see the light shining on the minotaur&#39;s body, he was now 5 times bigger than he was before his body twitching. Corbin could see he had longer claws and his face was more monstrous and less human. But then he also saw the place were he injected the minotaur was now spasing out fast. His hands were clenched, he was holding back the transformation at least for now. <br />
<br />
Corbin grabbed John and the monster roared, he threw his hammer down at John but he missed. He pushed Corbin away and he hit a nearby bookshelf. John was screaming &quot;Corbin...find the mask quickly&quot;. Corbin followed his commands and kept looking through the books, and then he realised something. The greens, reds, yellows and blues all had the same text inside them. He scanned the area and saw a single purple one of the top shelf of one of the shelves. With his new minotaur body he climbed up the shelves and attempted to grab the books, but then he was attacked by the birds mentioned before. He swung his axe at them and thought he got a lot, but he didn&#39;t they were pecking at his body hard. He reached for the book through the pain. He was nearly there. He grabbed the book and jumped to the bottom of the room. He opened it up inside was the mask.<br />
<br />
He ran towards the pedestal and slammed the mask down on it. He was relieved he found it, the birds seemed to stop. He was feeling okay until he heard Johns scream, Corbin turned around and saw John underneath the monster. The minotaur bent down onto John and to Corbins horror he saw John twitch violently as his legs started to get absorbed by the creature &quot;AHHHH CORBIN HELP&quot;. John looked In horror as his body started to twitch and grow In size, he was melding to the monster and he couldn&#39;t escape. His legs ruptured in minotaur legs and so did his entire body. He groaned in pain. But then he felt it...like some warm sensation wafted over him. He was taking over control of the minotaur, he moved his right hand and it was the minotaurs. He now had the power. He groaned in pleasure as the rest of his body was absorbed. The minotaurs face now resembling his friend Johns. &quot;Ooooh the power!&quot; he said flexing his muscles &quot;Join me corbin...it feels so good...make me stronger&quot; the monster was now five times bigger than corbin and advance towards him. Corbin looked around and saw the door open. He ran towards it, now the monster was chasing him &quot;Don&#39;t...r-run corbin!&quot; he said John. But luckily Corbin got away in time.<br />
<br />
IRL corbin stopped playing and looked at John, he was lying on the floor violently shaking, rubbing his cock. He was now increasing in muscle mass too. Corbin was panicking, he couldn&#39;t let this happen. Suddenly he heard the computer beep, he looked and it said...<br />
<br />
-Do you want to simulate your player two-<br />
<br />
Corbin saw the wire disconnect from Johns controller, he looked at it for a second completely confused and then realised what he had to do. John was increasing in muscle mass fast now, he groaned louder. Corbin grabbed the sparking wire and slammed it down on Johns chest. John screamed as he disappeared into the wire. Into the game. <br />
<br />
He sat there...all alone again and looked at the screen.<br />
<br />
-This will happen to you...if you don&#39;t play by our rules. We will simulate you and you will remain a monster just like your friend John- <br />
<br />
Corbin was shocked. He just lost his best friend, he continued forward anyway.</p>
