<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the car continued on its way, the Eversons were none the wiser about what just happened, or what would happen soon.<br />
<br />
Inside, Debra was busy checking her phone, while her twin brothers tried reaching their hands around her to tease each other. The teen was seriously regretting her choice of seat; maybe she could switch once their car stopped somewhere? <br />
<br />
“Dad, how much farther is it?”, she asked with annoyance. <br />
<br />
“Don’t know. 2 hours maybe?”, replied her father Henry, as he scanned the road ahead. “…it’s weird, we haven’t seen another car for miles.”<br />
<br />
“We’re not lost, are we?”, said his wife Linda. <br />
<br />
“No, this is the right route. We passed by the right signs a minute ago,” <br />
<br />
“Alright then...” Linda replied, as she adjusted the seatbelt that was brushing past her bare nipples. All of Linda’s clothes had completely vanished during their brief conversation, along with every piece of clothing on the other family members. None of them noticed this drastic change, and showed not even the slightest hint of embarrassment or surprised at their new nakedness. <br />
<br />
None of the family noticed that halfway through the parents talking, all their clothes had completely vanished, leaving them fully naked. <br />
<br />
The first physical changes happened. Debra and Linda’s breasts began to deflate into flat chests, and between their legs, their clitorises swelled and pushed further out like fleshy trees growing from their crotches. Their new appendages morphed into the capped shape of splotchy horse penises, and they were covered by hairless sheaths and sacks of large testicles. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the males of the family had their own genitals changing into a more equine shape. Their foreskins stuck to their bellies and became sheaths, while the rest of their penises and balls expanded to meet a similar size as Debra and Linda’s. Rick and Sam soon possessed identically sized shafts that were just smaller than Debra’s, but still quite large for 13-year olds. <br />
<br />
The family’s bodies start morphing into more animalistic proportions. Aside from getting slightly taller, their legs started contorting into the shape of equine hind legs. The toes on their bare feet melted together into the solid lumps that were horse hooves, though they were large enough for the family to properly stand upright. <br />
<br />
With their new legs, their rumps also expanded in size. Small nubs started growing out from above their buttcracks, as their tailbones extended into movable tails. The car itself seemed to accommodate this change, as suddenly each seat had a hole for the tails to freely move about. However, they still remained hairless. <br />
<br />
Fur began growing on random spots around their lower bodies, and they spread out to cover the rest of their skins. Oddly, each family member was growing a different colored coat. In the back, the twins both grew white and brown spotted fur, while their sister-turned brother was growing black fur. Linda and Henry were taking on colors of chestnut and light tan respectively.  <br />
<br />
As the fur spread up to the family’s chests and arms, the family hands were changing into a hybrid between hand and hooves, with four long fingers tipped with large hard nails, and covered with light fur. Henry could still properly grip on the steering wheel, while Debra was still able to swipe her phone with them (and in fact was busy checking her facebook during the whole change).<br />
<br />
When the fur reached the base of their necks, the family’s ears started to go pointy and shifted to the tops of their heads. Their hair started growing out from behind their necks like manes (which have lengthened as well), and their colors shifted into hues that matched each of their specific coats. Debra soon possessed black hair, while the twins and their former mother took on dark brown tones. Henry’s mane became the lightest of the family as it shifted to bright blonde.<br />
With their hair changed, their tails also grew a tuft of hair matching their new manes, and they waved about behind the family’s seats while they still were completely oblivious to their new bodies. <br />
<br />
The last change was their faces, which stuck oddly from their equine forms. Their noses and mouths began pushing out together into one. Linda was talking to her (or his) husband as this happened, and neither of them noticed their words slurring while their face stretched out into a proper snouts, and their teeth jutting out further like proper horse’s teeth. In the back seats, Debra barely batted an eye as her eyes pushed further apart to the sides of her growing head, and Rick gave a horse-like snort as he laughed at a joke from his twin.<br />
<br />
The entire family had fully transformed into five anthropomorphic stallions. The magic that changed their bodies was also at work manipulating their memories, as well as adjusting reality to fit their new forms. The luggage in the back of their cars disappeared, while any pictures and videos of the family (including on Debra’s phone) now only showed them in their anthro-animal forms.<br />
To the Eversons, they have and always will be anthro-horses. What else could they be? <br />
<br />
“Dad! Rick and Sam are poking me with their sheaths!”, Debra complained, now with a deeper, male sounding voice. Sure enough, the twins were nudging their sheathed horse dicks against their elder brother’s sides.<br />
<br />
“Kids, it’s not nice to bother your brother like that.” Linda scolded. Technically, both Linda and Henry were now dads of the family. “We might be taking a rest stop ahead, you can switch seats if you want.”<br />
<br />
“We’re not there yet?”, Debra asked, as one of his ears wiggled in annoyance.<br />
<br />
“No, it’s still an hour or so,” said Henry. “I thought we might stop somewhere just to walk around. Stretch our legs, maybe go to the bathroom.”</p>
