<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After ice cream Anna and Amelia's mother took them shopping. Amelia had found a Lemon Meringue doll and Anna had found a Skipper and Ricky doll set with bendable legs and arms. For some reason Angelina thought that the Strawberry Shortcake dolls had been discontinued as was Skipper.<br />
<br />
Angelina was alone now as Anna and Amelia's mother had decided to take them swimming. They couldn't take Strawberry Shortcake or Angelina with them. This was ok with Angelina since it gave her the chance to look at the book again. She was currently in the library trying to find a spell to fix things though what needed to be fixed she didn't know. All she knew was that she was driven to find the spell that would fix things. She turned to one spell and began reading it hoping that this was the spell she was looking for.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Rick was fifteen and would be a freshmen in high school when it started in the fall. He had gone over to Mr. Mendes' house to see Ric and Josh. He had met them just a few months ago when they had volunteered to work on the end of school fair. They became friends pretty quickly. Mr. Mendes had told Rick that he could come over to see Ric and Josh anytime he wanted over the Summer.<br />
<br />
When Rick had finally been able to make it over in the afternoon he discovered that there was a woman living there instead of Mr. Mendes. When Rick had asked where Mr. Mendes was the woman had said that she didn't know any Mr. Mendes. He had told her that Mr. Mendes lived there but she insisted that she had been living there for the past five years.<br />
<br />
Rick left wondering what was going on. He was sure that he had the right address but maybe he was wrong. He decided to go see Alice and see if she remembered where Mr. Mendes lived. Alice was kind of Rick's girlfriend. They both had strong feelings for each other that went beyond being just friends. They had even gone on a couple of dates to the movies chaperoned by Rick and Alice's mothers. Rick had even kissed Alice on the cheek at the end of their dates.<br />
<br />
As Rick was walking toward Alice's house he felt waves of pleasure wash over him. He wondered where they came from. Maybe it was the thought of seeing Alice today that was doing it. As he passed a car he caught something out of the corner of his eye in the side mirror. He turned around and looked in the mirror. What he saw scared him. It looked like he was fading from existence. He looked down at his body and confirmed that he was indeed fading. All sorts of possibilities as to why he was fading occurred to him. One was that he was somehow slipping into a different reality.<br />
<br />
Everything went white for a few moments. When color returned Rick was in a house. He looked over to his right and saw two Barbie dolls as big as he was. He thought he knew what he was but when he looked down at himself he was surprised at what he saw. He had thought that he would be a Ken doll but what he saw was two mounds on his chest. He could tell that he wasn't quite as tall as the Barbie dolls so he wasn't Barbie. He spotted a real looking mirror and went over to it. From what he saw in the mirror he figured that he was Skipper, Barbie's sister. Alice's mother had a large collection of Barbie dolls which she was quite proud of. Whenever he was over at Alice's house her mother would always show him her recent acquisitions. That's how he knew that he was Skipper though he looked a little different.<br />
<br />
It took Rick a moment to figure out what was different. His arms and legs were a different material than the rest of his body. He thought back to Alice's mother's doll collection. One of the dolls she had was a Bendable Leg Skipper. His arms and legs looked like the legs on that doll. He had thought that the Skipper line had been discontinued then he thought about what had happened. If he had slipped into another reality, and it looked like he had, then the Skipper line could still be in production.<br />
<br />
A hysterical voice behind him asked &quot;What's going on here!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick turned around to see a Ricky doll standing up and looking at him.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As Rick was walking to see Alice she was in the shower. Her younger brother and sister had dumped some chocolate pudding on her. Her mother had came in just as they did that and promptly scolded them. She then sent them to their rooms and told Alice to take a shower while she cleaned up the mess on the carpet.<br />
<br />
Alice rinsed her hair a final time and was sure she had gotten all the chocolate pudding out. She was just about to turn off the shower and get out when waves of pleasure washed over her. She just stood there relishing the sensations until she couldn't feel the water hitting her anymore. At first she thought that the water had been turned off but she was hearing the water hit the bottom of the tub. She looked down and saw water going right through her. She tried yelling for her mother but nothing came out.<br />
<br />
Alice really started to panic when she noticed that her body was fading. She was so terrified that she just stood there. Soon everything turned white. Alice tried to rationalize this as a dream. That was it, she had fallen asleep and was dreaming this. Somehow though she knew that this wasn't a dream. When color came back she saw that she was sitting down in a different room and more than likely a different house. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a strange looking girl stand up and walk over to a mirror. This girl looked like she was a doll.<br />
<br />
Alice looked over to her right where the girl had been and saw two Barbie dolls the same size as she was. She looked down at herself and discovered that she didn't have breasts anymore. By now she was starting to hyperventilate because she was so scared. She looked back up at the girl and asked in a hysterical voice &quot;What's going on here!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl turned around and Alice was shocked to see that she looked like Barbie's sister Skipper. It had to be a costume but as she stared at the girl she began to look more and more real.</p>
