<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Shit, I should have known better than to pick a kid&#39;s movie.&quot; Griped Jen. She was not as disappointed about sucking her sister&#39;s cock in public as she was at missing the better half of the movie. She actually wanted to see it. But thanks to a bad guy getting kicked in the balls, and then referencing his now sore dick, Jen had missed most of it. <br />
<br />
The other reason she was frustrated, was with Olivia, who had not once but 3 times prolonged the durration by saying &quot;dick&quot; right as Jen went back to normal. She did this as punishment for Jen accidentally spilling her drink all over her when she went in for the first blowjob by thrusting her head into Olivia&#39;s crotch by going over the arm rest. As they were in the lower row, Jen could actually use a chair for once. But that had been a huge mistake that Olivia would now not soon forget. Jen is allowed to be in a chair, but no more drinks are allowed to be in the cup holder positioned in between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is why I didn&#39;t want to go out of the house.&quot; Jen muttered to herself. &quot;Oh no. You can not say that this is a valid reason to become a shut in. If you do, I am dragging you out of the house and will take you for a nice walk by making you become my pet dog whenever you turn&quot; threatened Olivia. Jen knew that she was completely serious too. &quot;Ok fine. But just not too often.&quot; Compromises Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope again. Mom even said that you need to get out a lot more. The sooner you get use to this, the better you will be prepared when you become an full adult and move out. You need to either make a few friends who you can trust or find a lover who can protect you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You both keep saying that, but it isn&#39;t like it is that easy to do&quot; complained Jen. She knew the real reason as to why she was so frustrated with this. And only 1 other person in the world knew as well. She use to have a lot of friends. But this new reality had robbed her of them all. Now she had no one. As proof, her phone&#39;s contact list had just 3 enteries. Her parents and Olivia. The only other number in her call log was Kyle&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Additionally, as if she didn&#39;t have it hard enough as is. Even speaking to someone new was a huge challenge because she didn&#39;t speak words. And her moaning language takes quite a few attempts for people to start understanding it. Outside of her immediate family, hardly anyone knew what she was saying at any given time unless she either wrote it out or used sign language, which old Jen apparently knew, but the current Jen certainly did not. Although it felt extremely familiar, so perhaps she just needs to sed it once to resurface the burried memories of this reality&#39;s Jen. Just like how she did when she went pee earlier with the tree.<br />
<br />
They were nearly home when Olivia suddenly turned and drove off into a different direction. But as Jen was unable to see anything out the windows besides the sky and the underside of trees, she didn&#39;t know any better. However it was taking them quite a while longer than usual. &quot;Are we not almost home yet, Olivia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I had an idea. We are heading over to one of my friend&#39;s house. She is just 2 years older than you and knowing you, I think I can confidently say that you will like her a lot. And since I trust her, I know she is safe for you to do so as well. But fair warning. She is like me, but inverse-ish. She&#39;s like 95% girl for sure, just with extra.  And she has been looking for a new girlfriend for a long time. Not saying that you have to be her girlfriend, but just that there is the option if things go well between you two.&quot; Explained Olivia in a way that just bairly wouldn&#39;t set Jen&#39;s &quot;cock lust&quot; off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait no! Please don&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to see anyone new today&quot; begged Jen, but it was futile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you don&#39;t, and I am sorry for the bad timing, but we have to do this. Mom and dad are working super late tonight and I am spent for at least the rest of the day. But you still need to eat some more. And I refuse to let my little sis go hungry. So we are going, and I can testify that she is one of if not the nicest person I know, usually at least&quot; insidsted Olivia. And as she said that she pulled into her friend&#39;s driveway. Olivia stepped out of her car and knocked on the front door of the house while leaving Jen still inside the car. After a brief greeting which Jen only could hear as a muffled conversation, the side door was opened up and Olivia helped her exit the car. Standing near the car was Olivia&#39;s friend. This very pretty, orange-red head. She was fairly tall and seemed to just have everything in perfect proportion to each other. Well most things. Her hair was well past her ass in length, but was kept neat and clean looking in a single long dutch braid down her left side. And after a closer look, Jen noticed that there was a good amount of her hair, especially in the back, that had been died gray and white. The other disproportionately sized thing was the obvious huge cock buldge in her leggings, and her massive testicles were the icing on this packing futanari cake. Just the size of her buldge alone was more than enough to push Jen into &quot;cock lust&quot;. She had never wanted anything inside of her mouth as much as she wanted this amazing cock to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you are even prettier than Olivia had mentioned&quot; complimented the girl. Olivia then introduced them to each other while holding Jen back. Jen only would find out much later that this girl&#39;s name was Melody.</p>
