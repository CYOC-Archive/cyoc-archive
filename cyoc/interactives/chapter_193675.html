<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason woke up starving. The slight food bump from the night before was gone and he was hungry. It didn&#39;t help that there was something fantastic smelling wafting through his room. Jason sat up and moved to the side of the bed, letting his bare feet hit the wooden floor. He plucked at the front of his tee in annoyance. Jason never wore really loose clothing, but this shirt was getting a little on the tight side. Maybe he was getting that growth spurt his doctor had been promising for years. He laughed sourly at the thought.<br />
<br />
Looking around the room, lit rather well by the still rising sun, he saw a tray sitting on the table covered by a napkin. The source of those wonderful smells. First though he found his discarded pants and dug out his phone. Still no signal worth the name, but he stared blearily at the time. &quot;Six thirty?&quot; He muttered. He was never up this early. Must have been from going to bed so soon after dinner. He did feel well rested if a bit groggy.<br />
<br />
He got to his feet and headed towards the table. He stumbled the first few steps and glared down at his feet. It was like the stupid things felt too big on the end of his legs. He squinted at them for a moment. Were they bigger? No. That was stupid. He dropped down in the seat as he flicked back the cloth covering on the food. The good smells grew even stronger. Bacon, eggs, buttery toast, hash browns, sausage, a whole pitcher of milk. It was enough to feed three people. There was a note, too.<br />
<br />
He picked up his fork and started digging in as he scanned the note. The handwriting was blockish, but easy to read.<br />
<br />
&#39;Dad decided to let you sleep in since you had a rough day yesterday. When you&#39;re fed get dressed and meet me in the cow barn.<br />
Dean&#39;<br />
<br />
Downing a glass of milk, Jason set the note down and looked out the window. He had a good view of that barn and could see Dean lugging bales of hay into it. He was shirtless again, though he had his overalls up today. Jason just shook his head. He had been expecting some country doofus, or maybe some dumb brute. But he had to admit he actually liked his cousin. He wasn&#39;t bad looking either.<br />
<br />
The thought stopped Jason as he crunched through a piece of bacon. He never really thought of anyone like that before. Like his body never really developing, his sex drive hadn&#39;t either. He thought that was just part of him but.. Less than one day out here in the country and he was thinking of his cousin as cute?!<br />
<br />
Jason poured himself another glass of milk and pushed that thought away. He chugged it down and went to pick up another piece of bacon but his hands met only plate. He moved his gaze down and with a start realized he had eaten everything. Even the pitcher was empty. He looked down a bit more and saw his tee riding up over a slight food gut that stuck out from his otherwise scrawny frame. He gave it a slight pat and shook his head. He thought he&#39;d feel sick after eating that much but he just felt energetic.<br />
<br />
Getting up, he pulled off his shirt and dug in his suitcase for a fresh change of underwear, then pull out on of his older shirts. If he was going to be doing farm work he wasn&#39;t going to wear a shirt he liked. This shirt felt strangely tight as well, and not just in the stomach. Did he shrink his laundry by accident when rushing it before packing? He looked at his jeans for a moment, then to the box of work clothes Dean had brought him. With a sigh he pulled out one of the sets of overalls and held them up in front of him. They&#39;d be too small on Dean, but they still looked on the big side for him.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, when he pulled them on they hung on him like a sack. The waist was down by his hips and his feet disappeared into the legs. At least the shoulder straps kept them up. He shrugged and pulled on some socks and then the work boots. Those, despite looking too big actually fit well. He tucked the bottoms of his overalls into the top of his boots to keep them from dragging on the ground. He looked silly, like a kid playing farmer dress up. The food paunch did not help the look.<br />
<br />
With no other choice he shook his head and left his room, heading down to meet Dean for the first day of his summer torture.</p>
