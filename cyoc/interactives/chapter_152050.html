<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff very slowly begins to come awake. He hears noises around him, but he&#39;s very groggy. His body feels extremely stiff and heavy. He tries to move, but instead, begins to pass out again. <br />
<br />
He then feels someone patting the side of his face. Along his snout. It felt...odd. his face felt.....&quot;long.&quot; <br />
<br />
He rolls his eyes around and tries to rub them. He only manages to awkwardly extend one of his forelegs. He hears a voice, but is unable to understand what it&#39;s saying. He still feels someone rubbing his cheek and his really long nose. <br />
<br />
He tries opening his eyes again, but again, they&#39;re all blurry. His vision is blurry. He hears a woman saying something, but cannot make it out. Despite how good his hearing is. <br />
<br />
He moans and goes to lay his very strangely heavy head back down, and his eyeballs close again. He then feels someone lift his head back up, and he tries to open his eyes again. He tries to say something, but only a light &quot;hhaaww&quot; issues out of his strange-feeling, cottony mouth. <br />
<br />
He closes his eyes again, but then the person is persistent. Sorta lightly slaps the side of his head, trying to keep him awake. His eyes roll around, as he tries focusing on something. His vision begins to clear, but it&#39;s still not right. He doesn&#39;t see any colors, and it&#39;s mostly all a blurry, misty grays and blacks all around. Everything smells like a barn. A strong smelling barn with fresh hay. Not wholly unpleasant.<br />
<br />
He continues to hear someone saying something and focuses his eyesight on her. <br />
A female voicd. He could tell that much, at least. He tries to ask where he is, but just manages to say &quot;hhhaawww.&quot;<br />
<br />
This female human continues speaking gently. She&#39;s speaking clearly and loudly enough for him to hear her. But for some reason, he doesn&#39;t understand the words she&#39;s saying. What language is that? It sounds almost familiar. He could ALMOST pick out a couple of words, but his brain refuses to make the proper connections. <br />
<br />
He then sees and hears this girl stand up and tugs on something. Something attached to his mouth. He tries to resist, but feels the tugging on the back of his furthest back teeth. A bar. A bar attached to a rope. A rope this female is tugging. He then feels straps around his face and his skull. <br />
<br />
The woman is persistent. She continues tugging on the reigns, forcing his head forward. He has no option but to try and stand. It wasn&#39;t wholly unpleasant, the way it felt. But it was so forceful and insistent, that he had to comply.<br />
<br />
Awkwardly, he tries to stand. But it isn&#39;t right. It doesn&#39;t feel right. His back feels long. TOO long. So long, that he is unable to stand on his two feet and legs. Instead, he stands on all fours. Much more comfortable that way. He didn&#39;t know why he should be standing on two legs. He isn&#39;t built for that.<br />
<br />
Attempting to speak again, he can barely open his mouth. All he can do, is twitch his large black lips. Revealing his big yellow-black buck teeth doing so. He tries forcing air out of his lungs, into his diaphragm, and out of his vocal chords. He meant to ask where he was again. &quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww,&quot; is all that comes out.<br />
<br />
The woman again, says something and it sounds strangely familiar. But Jeff is unable to quite understand what she was saying.<br />
<br />
She continues to tug at the reigns, pulling on the infernal bit in his mouth and forcing him forward. She leads him outside, across a field, and to another outbuilding. He tried to assess his surroundings, but each time he tried turning his head, she would yank the reigns to face him ahead of where she was leading him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on,?&quot; His still-addled brain is asking himself.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Why can&#39;t I talk? Why don&#39;t I understand what that girl is saying? Who IS that girl anyways, and why do I have a hunk of metal in my mouth attached to ropes? Where is she taking me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Intermittently, he tries to ask a few of those questions outloud. All the girl hears is &quot;eerrgghh hhhaawww eerrgghh hhhaaww.&quot;<br />
<br />
She leads him into another outbuilding. A workshop, of sorts. She leads him to a post, where she quickly ties the lead around and shortens the reigns, not allowing him to move far or move his head from side-to-side. That bar in his mouth was hurting, and moving around too much, only would make it worse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhaawww,&quot; Jeff uncomfortably tries again. <br />
<br />
He feels his left arm lift off the ground, and bend at the knees, bringing his hand to point upward, while steangely under his belly. He feels off-balance and starts tipping over. But this girl knows what she&#39;s doing. She braces and supports him. <br />
<br />
She gets out a hammer and a chisel. She then starts to tap on his hand. Only, it didn&#39;t feel like a &quot;hand.&quot; It felt hard and stiff. He couldn&#39;t move his fingers or open and close his hands. He was wondering why.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the farm girl was gently, yet firmly, removing whatever gunk and muck was caught in his hoof. Then she starts clipping his hoof, and shaping it the desired shape. To Jeff, it just felt like a dull &quot;thudding&quot; on the end of his arm against whatever was holding his hand hostage. <br />
<br />
That job complete, she then starts to nail Jeff&#39;s very first horseshoe into place. &quot;Thud, thud, thud,&quot; goes the first nail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thud, thud, thud,&quot; goes the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thud, thud, thud,&quot; goes the third and final one. <br />
<br />
She then let his left arm down. But when it touched the ground, it felt slightly taller. The already dull-feeling ground was essentially not able to be felt at all. His arm felt slightly heavier, and he would tap it on the ground in the attempt to get feeling back into his hand. It made a different quality of sound, than when he tapped his right hand against the ground. It was slightly heavier, and with no feeling at all. <br />
<br />
But now the girl is forcing his rear left leg up next. And again, the same round of maintenance and horseshoe-fitting occurs there. His second of his first set of four horseshoes is now in place.<br />
<br />
He tries to tap the floor with his left arm again to break his hand free while she was moving around his front and towards the back of his right side. It&#39;s never safe to walk around the back of any equine, especially one you don&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
She cleans and shoes the rear right leg. Then does the same for the right foreleg. <br />
<br />
This was a new experience for Jeff. His hooves have now been shod. He&#39;s officially entered the proper life of a donkey as a farm animal. His very first set of horseshoes! Ones he would be totally incapable of ever removing himself. Totally dependant on a human doing it when they wore out. Always wearing them night and day. Never to take them off. They mark him for what he is. Not that it mattered much. Afterall, he&#39;d always be &quot;wearing&quot; his hooves at the ends of his four legs night and day. His hands forever trapped. No matter how much he would always want them back. Feeling trapped like a person in a coffin 6 feet under the dirt, he thought back to his reference of comparison from before. Only this time, there is no rescue. He&#39;ll never be out of this suffocating coffin. Never. Always trying to thrash about to find an exit, but only wasting a lot of energy instead and causing severe panic attacks. <br />
<br />
The girl continues to speak to him in very pleasant tones. But he&#39;s never able to understand her. It also takes him several more hours for his brain to clear. He slowly begins to remember the past two days. Was it two days? What day is this? He knew it was close to the fourth of July, but had no idea what day it actually was. His 14th birthday less than two weeks away. <br />
<br />
The nice girl then leads him back to the barn, ties his reign to another post, grabs a pitch fork, and starts spreading hay before him. <br />
<br />
His addled mind thinks that smells good, and his belly rumbles. He wonders if he could get something to eat. He&#39;s also very thirsty. He tries asking for food and water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrgghh hhhaaww Eeerrrgghh hhhaaww Eeerrrgghh hhhaaww.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl comes over to pet his strangely long face again, and gently lowers his head towards the hay. He instinctively opened his mouth, and took his very first bite of fresh hay like any member of his species would. No hands required. <br />
<br />
He begins to mindlessly munch on this sweet-tasting, yummy straw. He stands there for quite sometime, just chewing like a donkey, and swallowing the mush. Taking another bite. Chewing side-to-side, swallowing. <br />
<br />
He is unaware of the amount of time that passes. But realizes at some point, that he&#39;s thirsty. He smells water. He knows it&#39;s water for some reason. Water doesn&#39;t usually have too much of a smell, unless it rains. But this was different from the smell of rain. This actually smelled like....well....water!<br />
<br />
He wanders over to where his brain tells him is the source. He instinctively dunks his mouth into an animal trough, and starts greedily lapping up the previous, cold liquid. Not from a cup. Not from his cupped hands. But with his head lowered directly into a heavily-used animal trough. <br />
<br />
Again , he has no idea of the amount of time that passes. He just stands there, continually lapping up the refreshing liquid from a trough in a barn.<br />
<br />
Eventually satisfied, he notices the girl has left. He also notices a crackling sound. Not a continuous crackling sound. An intermittent crackling sound. He wanders to the edge of the property on all fours and puts his face out towards the fence. He got his face close, when he felt the tingling of electricity spark up his nostrils. That stung! A lot! <br />
<br />
Crying in pain, Jeff brays: &quot;eeerrrgghh HHAAAAWWWW!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now becoming more fully aware, he tries to talk, but finally actually hears himself for the first time:<br />
<br />
&quot;EEERRGGHH HHHAAWW EEERRGGHH HHHAAWW.&quot;<br />
<br />
With fear sparking in the pit of his stomach, memories begin flashing through his mind. Images. Terrible images. Images of a fat, unhealthy donkey. Images of himself as that donkey! <br />
<br />
&quot;EEERRGGHH HHHAAWW EEERRGGHH HHHAAWW!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He tries stand up on two legs in denial of his very real body, but the gravity, his terribly out-of-shape body, and achy middle-aged joints don&#39;t allow him to. He&#39;s stuck forever on all fours! Eerrgghh Hhhaaww!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf did I get myself into!?&quot; he attempts to say. &quot;Eeerrggghh hhhaawww,,&quot; he actually says.<br />
<br />
&quot;A donkey! I&#39;m a fucking DONKEY! WTF, WHY!?&quot; EERRRGGHH HHAAWW EERRRGGHH HHHAAWW EERRGGGHH HHHAAWW!<br />
<br />
His nuts have had several hours to produce donkey baby batter since he relieved himself in his parents yard. That was now a long time ago. The very last vestiges of an old life he would forever leave behind.<br />
<br />
 His penis extends outward. But then, he hears braying behind himself and to his right. Then he smells it! It smells godawful, but forces his penis to shoot out and begin pumping on its own. <br />
<br />
He sees another donkey walk up next to him, screaming her presence. She then turns around, and lifts her tail. That...that...SMELL! <br />
<br />
It&#39;s terrible, raunchy, and intense. It drives his lust. A part of his brain shuts down. His logical thinking part. But not completely. He thinks to himself:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Not that! Please, please not that!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh Hhhaaww EERRRgghhh hhaaww&quot; he brays, trying to talk. His ability to speak drives him more mad. He turns towards the female, and begins sniffing her cunt. The all the sudden, he gets sprayed up his nose and in his mouth! He just swallowed another donkey&#39;s piss, and breathed some up his nose! A natural-born donkey, which made it somehow worse! <br />
<br />
She looks back, and brays mockingly, curling her thick, black lips that look all too similar to Jeff&#39;s own thick black lips. &quot;Hhee hhaaww hhheee hhaaww,&quot; she brays sharply.<br />
<br />
Then the smell of her oft-used loose cunt by other countless unknown male donkeys slapped him in the face, metaphorically speaking.<br />
<br />
His penis as stiff and as long and wide as a flag pole, he turns completely towards her. Braying, while his mind is pleading to not do this at the same time as being driven with the desire to do exactly that, he has the willpower to FINALLY jump up on two legs. But with the intention of resting both of his forelegs on the rump of another donkey. One actually born with her body. Jeff wasn&#39;t born with his. Not transformed into one like Jeff was. A female of the perfect species for this particular male. A a female donkey with the proper, ignorant brain of one that knows nothing about personal hygiene. She was lucky. Jeff was in a nightmare his human brain could not ever comprehend. Knowing all about personal hygiene and germs. <br />
<br />
Like a heat-seeking missile, his penis immediately finds its home. It nails it&#39;s target, and Jeff latches onto her rearend with all of his might with his front hooves. He begins pounding her like an experienced veteran. Even though it&#39;s his very first time with a female. Unfortunately, not of the species his former middle school buddies would have any interest in. One he, himself, has no interest in, but his body does.<br />
<br />
He pounds her like an experienced vet, and she takes it like a well-used 56 year old hooker in Vegas. Both braying in unison. Her cunt latching onto his dick, much like his front hooves latching onto her rump. Braying. And braying together. Jeff with nothing but his perfect photographic memory of what his body truly is and looks like. Trapped inside. Unable to escape. Helpless, with the exception of dominating the female in front of, and below him. The sort of female that&#39;s now a perfect match for him. A perfect match, that is, for this one time. This one moment in time. He&#39;ll find others like her. They all look the same. Smell the same. Wear the same body. <br />
<br />
&quot;EEEEEEEEEEERRGGHH HHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWW!!!!!!&quot; Both declaring their contract complete.</p>
