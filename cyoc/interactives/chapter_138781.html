<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Gosh...what a sight”<br />
<br />
As Carrie stepped into the restroom...streets of gold and silver layered over the taps and walls. Black Marble where her feet was resting on, as well as the fact that the stalls looked as prestige and famous as the owner itself-<br />
<br />
“No! I must look for my wife...my wife...-UGH!”<br />
<br />
She clutched her head, walking to the sink as slowly-one by one-memories of her wife erased before her very eyes. Not even understanding why...not even knowing the curse had her retained those memories in order to trap her in the FEMALE restroom.<br />
<br />
‘That’s right, you are woman, behave like one!’<br />
“AH!” <br />
<br />
Jolting her eyes open to that voice. As a cursee , thanks to the Matire’d at the front, the voice had full access to her-and the manipulation of memories and even her vision as eyes were directed to a special-matching diamond ring on the top of the sink.<br />
<br />
She picked it up, it glistening and glowing like hers. Her former wife had no use of it now that she was married to someone else...wait! Former? No-she was!<br />
<br />
“NO! WIFEY!”<br />
<br />
She clutched her head harder this time, struggling to remember what she loved about that woman....her perky breasts, her gorgeous smile, and especially her humble personality. With all these thoughts flushing to her, nipples erect as long sharp RIPPS shredded through the undercover gloves she wore without mercy. Revealing long, girly finger nails that have been manicured daily with a dash of red over each of em.<br />
<br />
RIPPPP!<br />
GASP!<br />
<br />
Immediately stopping the clutching, as her hands were brought to her attention.<br />
<br />
Gone were the sounds and fabric of her gloves, as her palms were now revealed to smooth and slender-as though they never underwent any kind of hardship or lifted any form of masculine exercise...like weights. As the tips of her fingers bred a single pale caucasian complexion that trailed and colored downwards over her former ethnicity.<br />
<br />
“WHAT IN TARNATION?!” She yelled, before those slender fingers covered her mouth, as a relaxation and calmness went over her head. That everything was fine...everything was fine.<br />
<br />
As with that reassurance, as the caucasian tone trailed past her wrists, the shredding stopped. The black pulling a 360 as it was all about expense! Turning into a pair of white opera gloves that stopped at her elbow, pure and white-fabric much thinner and more appropriate for a lady such as herself.<br />
<br />
With that notion, the wedding bands have to go-like the pearls she wore on the right. Rings breaking apart and connecting together into one loop, stretching to the size of the pearls while the pearly whites grew more expensive into a girl’s best friend, they flattened together into diamond wristbands-hanging just above the opera gloves.<br />
<br />
As soon as Carrie saw that-she wanted to panic, but as the rest of her arms spotted a gentle caucasian white, slim and small, her right hand reached behind her back as her left simply clenched while letting the index finger to her lips-as her mouth echoed a-<br />
<br />
Shhhhhhhhhhh~<br />
<br />
Her blouse broke apart, the sleeves ripping off and hanging over her weakening shoulders as she was silenced by her captive, emotions going at peace as though she undergone a severe case of Stockholm syndrome as a damsel in distress. Her face flushing, as the paling tone spread apart her back which revealed no traces of brown foreign latina around.<br />
<br />
“What in tarnation~” She echoed her line once again, as though she was reciting her script...but much more in character. “Ah thought Latinas were from South America?”<br />
<br />
Cue Audience laughter, like most shows in the 50s, mind getting slower and more oblivious and clueless as though she were from that era herself. Like a rich daddy’s girl as the broken sleeves stretched long and fluffy, into a pair of long white fur that famous celebrities wear when walking down the red carpet.<br />
<br />
With that notion, stopping only at the middle of her breasts, her sports bra leaped out and looped over her thinning neck, twisting into a long string of diamonds as her vocal chords gained decades of airiness passed down for generations in the Whittemore family.<br />
<br />
“Whittemore? Ah sure ah was from America”<br />
<br />
With each line, her old attire was getting hotter and hotter-definitely not something a southern belle like her oughta be wearing as her interests shift from being an entrepreneur to shopping with daddy’s money! Attire changed from lazily dressed self-wear with occasional buttoned downs and jeans or blouse if needed to convince conservatives, to long dresses-jewelry and make up!<br />
<br />
With that thought, her belt lunged out as the remains of the blouse and the navy blue skirt. Revealing her jugs as they inflated massively as though they were huge balloons as a layer of white fluff coated just above her rock hard nipples-incredible sexual tension that aroused the remaining bits of the lesbian-even though she had no clue what a les-bo-yan was. Was it chinese food?<br />
<br />
As the remains merged together with the blouse, they became frilly and grew longer by the minute, spreading below her thighs as the belt tightened around her tummy-causing it to strain taut and uncomfortable against it as it broke aside any disgusting junk food and fats that a famous lady should not be having! The belt ending off into a big white bow at the center of her tummy, Leaving a slender hourglass shape she prided upon as daddy told her that’s what gets the men!<br />
<br />
Her back and front already white, now comes to her ass as those cheeks became more plump like her jugs as compared to her skinny beauty figure, modelling as they pushed outward against her panties as they fluffed into a pair of lacy white underwear-intricate patterns as an attempt to show that she is complex despite her intelligence as her pussy continued to drip wet in confused anticipation....really wanting something to be put in...<br />
<br />
With that arousal, she squeezed and rubbed her slit together between her knees, as the stockings raised, longer but far tighter as those legs were an epitome of perfection, thin as they grew slightly longer-reaching up to 5ft 11 as she was white.<br />
<br />
“That’s right! Im white-more!”<br />
<br />
Pushing up even slightly higher, flats raising upward at the heel as they became ruby red. Feeling so much appreciation to daddy as she recalled a closet filled with em of various sizes! The only shame was that she was unable to show men her gorgeous pedicure! As under it, feet much smaller than before-befitting of a lady, were gorgeously painted nails that matched her shoes and nails.<br />
<br />
‘And not forget lipstick~!’<br />
As that voice echoed into her head, her breasts expanded to the size of bowling balls as she could only flash smile at it. Teeth shifting, flossing and polishing to perfection as they became white as snow, with lips being crowned and layered with the same red echo that her nails experienced, as her sexy tongue loved those delicious celebrity vegan buffets that were not only healthy-but totally kept her model figure slim.<br />
<br />
She was a movie star after all.<br />
<br />
“Oh~Im so hungry~Ohhhhhhhhhhhh~”<br />
<br />
Her tummy rumbling, a true gal remains slim in the belly despite how much vegan meals she has! But no junk food or anything of that sort of course tee-hee! As the food goes elsewhere, her butt, her boobs, and her cheeks as they grew slightly round to give her a doll face her co-star loved to say that to her. She was hungry....but not just in the tummy.<br />
<br />
“I need a man to take care of me~Oh...Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh~”<br />
<br />
A moan rivaling a certain Bling,  one that is as sexy as ever but carries a taste of innocence and naivety that drives men insane! As her nose became small and petite, her vision became blurry all of a sudden before the cloud faded away with the spreading apart of those rectangular glasses she once saw.<br />
<br />
“Ah coulda sworn ah was in Texas!”<br />
<br />
The band restraining her hair dissipated, as her entire body, face to toe, was covered in that pale Caucasian white-losing every trace of any other ethnicity as she had family who lived since the 19th century. Ms Whittamore ‘s ears were definitely pierced without restraint due to gender roles, and my she is definitely not complaining! Accept the comments about...fem...na...sism....whatever they were, they consisted of some of the one stars in her movie! How rude!<br />
<br />
The specs shone and upgraded themselves into more of her friends, looped around her ear lobes were antique diamond earrings that the girls of the Whittemore family wore on a special occasion....especially today.<br />
<br />
As the final changes took hold, an invisible stylist took hold of her hair as the brown curled up into a blonde fluff, curling around her head as she pouted her ruby red lips as blush and makeup doned her gorgeous appearance.<br />
<br />
Those famous glamour waves were legendary in her family, blonde curly locks dating back since forever as the women who prided on them always succeeded in every date they wore! Even more so as her daddy warned her about homo! Not too sure what it is but all daddy said was that if you are scared! Yell ‘EEEK! HOMO!’<br />
<br />
With that note, the dumb blonde was almost complete, as the voice wanted the world to see its newest creation. As it summoned a shadow of her former self in the mirror-Ms Whittemore rubbed her lenses, eyebrows thinning and blonde like her intelligence.<br />
<br />
Peering into her windows , she saw a strange girl...not even recognising it being her former self as that shadow started YELLING!<br />
<br />
‘NO WIFEY’<br />
“EEEK! HOMO!”<br />
<br />
Her eyes were scared into an innocent sky blue that was horrified by the bad guy, Ma Caitlyn Whittemore, daddy’s gal , rich celebrity and famous movie star extraordinare pulled up the sides of her dress which were all the way-frilly onto the top of her heels. Her petit hands barely doing any difference as she walked heel by heel into the door of the ladies restroom as though she seen a mouse-ready to pick up the door knob as a strong gust of wind flew through the mini window at the top of the toilet, pushing past the door as she was now expose to the world-<br />
<br />
PUSH!<br />
PUSH!<br />
<br />
CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!<br />
VROOOM!<br />
<br />
The door opened, an array of lights blared at her by tons of cameramen, leading them was a famous photographer who took her at a beach as she gingerly tried to push down her frilly dress-hovering past her head and almost revealing her panties thanks to the heat from a conveniently placed vent at the end of the toilet as though the architect did it on purpose.<br />
<br />
As a gust of wind blows over her silky bleach dress, giggling as while she was out of the open before she remembered the other man to her right...which was their left...gosh she was not good with compsses! But anyway-!<br />
<br />
What a handsome masculine figure was it that stepped out!</p>
