<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look around the top floor, checking out the bedrooms. You were glad that the master bedroom that your father took was on the bottom floor, but he had commented to you that there was another “second master” bedroom on the second, next to the guest rooms. It wasn’t hard to find, as there were statues of female antro wolves and foxes that basically pointed the way. You figure that either the original owner or last owner put these up here. Though, you found it weird that such a house was in a small, gated community. It didn’t seem to fit the others that were around. <br />
<br />
You opened the door to the second master and found that you actually liked how it looked. It had a built in desk for you to set up your computer and all your gear. The ethernet connectors all seemed to be the latest, though you weren’t sure if that was from the last owners or the seller. The connected bathroom was larger than your old room; a walkthrough shower and jacuzzi tub ready to go. The closet was also massive in comparison to your old house, dressers already build in to the walls. It seemed that your father also had a new bed delivered, a queen size bed set up on the far wall. There was even enough room for your own fireplace and small couch, giving you the hope of not having to deal with your father that much. <br />
<br />
You walk out of the room, guessing that it was time to start moving into your room. As you headed down the stairs, you saw your father bringing in his boxes already. “So already moved in?” He says with a snicker. “Didn’t see you being the excited one with this.” <br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” You ask, walking out the door. <br />
<br />
“Your stuff is not in the truck, I thought you moved it in.” Your father replies. <br />
<br />
You ran to the back of the moving trailer that was attached to your dad’s car, and sure enough, everything that was marked for you was gone. You start to panic before seeing a strange light coming from your new room. You head back up to the room, passing the wolf and fox women statues, and open your door to find that everything was already in place. Your computer was sitting at the built-in desk, plugged in and ready to go. It was even signed on, your monitor pic of a canine girl typing on a laptop in full display. Your clothes, what little you had, were placed in the closet already. The bed was made, the couch had some of your pillows from childhood on it; even your soap and shampoos were in the new bathroom. Everything was basically in place, just perfectly. <br />
<br />
“Must be the ‘magic’ my bud was talking about. But does this mean that the house likes me or am I about to be punish for some unknown ill intention.” Your words seemed to be answered as a notification pop on your computer. You walk over and read it aloud. <br />
<br />
“Hey, it’s from TheSum0dud3! Let’s see, ‘working delivery for my mom’s pizza shop. Told her that you were moving in today. She says that I can take the night off and bring some pizzas for you and that my sister will be covering my shift. They will be basic peperoni, but still. Free is free, right?’ Sweet!” You type back that you will see him then, and that peperoni pizza would be amazing. You then head out of your room to tell your dad. <br />
<br />
The evening comes, and TheSum0dud3 shows up at the house with the pizzas. He was driving an older small truck, not really big enough to hull stuff in. “You must be mrTr4nsform3r.” He says with a smile. His brown hair was messy, and his Hispanic accent lightly peppering his words. He was dressed in new clothes, as if he planned this visit somewhat. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but you can call me Timothy. Or Tim, if you like.” You reply, taking the pizzas and showing him in. <br />
<br />
“Call me Johnathan, or John. Wow, I never been in this house before.” He replies, “Though I did see the last couple that bought it.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, and why they leave?” You ask, walking him to the dining room. <br />
<br />
“No one knows. I was apparently the last to see them. The cops made a big deal about it because they were going to buy up a ton of property in town and demo it to build a mall. The town was against it, but they were family of the mayor or something. Anyways, I was off the hook because my next delivery was to the police station itself and they had a phone call showing that the couple was talking to the mayor at the same time. The mayor wasn’t too happy with her call proving my innocence, but whatever. She an ass as it is.”  John almost chuckled as they placed the pizzas on the table. <br />
<br />
Smelling the food, your father makes his way into the dining room, paper plates in hand. “So, my son does have a real friend.” He jokes. He hands out the plates before reaching a handout for John to shake. “Name’s Willam, but you can call me Bill.” <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Bill.” John replies, shaking the hand. <br />
<br />
The three all take a few slices of pizza before sitting down. You look at your father, his button up flannel seeming to be a bit smaller on him, as if he somehow grew fatter during the day. His pants also seemed tighter on him, a bulge forming in the front. You push this out of your mind while you eat. <br />
<br />
Your father starts talking to John, to which you visibly cringe. “You know, I was worried that my son found one of those fake people on the internet. That you were not real but someone from some strange country that was, what the term, catfishing him? But you seem to be a standup guy, John. You even have a job. I had hope that Timmy here would follow me into my work, but all he wants to do is draw all day.” <br />
<br />
“Well, there is money to be made in drawing, Mr. Bill. And your son is very good at it. I think when he gets establish, he could start his own comic or something.” John could see Bill’s disproval from just looking at his face, so he changed the subject. “What do you do for work?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I am to be the town’s new, oh, what was the title that the Mayor used, Minister of Product Transportation. I will basically be in charge of making sure that all the trucks coming in and out of town are following local and federal regs. I get an office downtown and even a few deputies under me. If Timmy was into working, he could join the police department and the Mayor could recommend him to work under me. Then he could take over when I retire.” Bill then lets out a large laugh, implying that you would never do that. <br />
<br />
You and John just stare at each other before continuing to eat. You both sit in silence as your father continues on about his job, and all that you are “missing out on.” As you three finish your meals, your father says he will take care of cleaning so you and John could talk up in your room. <br />
<br />
You and John quickly get out of the dining room, heading up stairs. Walking by the statues, John commits on how they look like maids. “That would be cool.” You reply. “Having wolf and fox girls as maids. Would have to make sure that I didn’t let that go to my head though.” You joked. <br />
<br />
In the room, John was looking around in awe. “Dude, I can’t believe how big this house is on the inside. It just doesn’t look it on the outside.” <br />
<br />
“True, and now I think we know how my dad got this house so cheap, if he is working for the mayor.” You add. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, be careful with that.” John replies. “She is one nasty piece of work.” Then, after checking to make sure the door was closed, John asks, “Any crazy magical stuff yet?” <br />
<br />
“Well, if you mean all my stuff magically popping up into my new room, all in a perfect place, then, no. Nothing yet.” John looks at you with a “seriously, dude” stare. <br />
<br />
“You are not pulling my let?” he asks. <br />
<br />
You shake your head. “No… Man, I thought all my stuff was left behind. Then I saw a flash in the room. When I got back up here, everything was in place, as if I placed it. Then your message popped up.” <br />
<br />
“I thought you replied back quickly. I thought you just did so from your phone.” John shrugs his shoulders. “Dude, you need to be careful here. This is a strange place.” <br />
<br />
“Fore sure. But I think I will be fine. If anything else happens, I will let you know.” You tell him. <br />
John nods, before asking. “So, how that next pic coming along?” <br />
<br />
“Let me show you.” You and John spend the rest of the night looking over your drawings until he heads home. You then climb into your new bed, falling asleep, wondering what would happen the next day. Seeing that your father had changed some already and how your stuff ended up in your room on their own worried you, but you were so tired from the day that you fell asleep almost instantly.</p>
