Passive Skill: The Cursed Hero: You will level up quickly, but luck is not your friend, and evil will be attracted to you.<br />
Next Alex got to pick a class skills and a occupational skill, and again he went by David’s instructions, selecting the two skills he had been told to.<br />

Alex is currently a 6 foot 2 human male, 19 years old with a muscular, shaved smooth frame, tanned skin, short brown hair, blue eyes and a visible 5 o’clock shadow.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Alex entered the Bathhouse, finding a small front room and two young women attending the front desk. There were a few different men and women loitering in the lobby area. Several had damp hair and glistening skin, indicating they had already bathed or received a massage.<br />
<br />
Approaching the desk, Alex presented the bronze token he had been given.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I see you have been given one of our gift tokens.” The young women smiled cheerily as she continued. “The bronze means you get a free potion, oil massage and access to the members only baths for the evening. Is this your first time receiving one of these tokens?”<br />
<br />
Alex noted a dialog wheel pop up in front of him, indicating several pre-programmed responses he could chose from, ranging from silent nodding to rude chastisement. Although a smaller hint window appeared telling him he was not restricted to the dialog wheel, the choices were just recommendations and he could respond any way he chose to.<br />
<br />
Realizing the young women had been silently staring at him, perfectly still, but the other patrons in the lobby were still moving around, and another person had arrived from the street and was awaiting his turn behind him, Alex blurted out.<br />
<br />
“Yes it is.” <br />
<br />
“Very good. Dimas here will show you around the baths, and we will have our masseuse fetch you for your massage after 2 hours, if that time frame suits you.” She replied expectantly, another dialog wheel appearing.<br />
<br />
“Yes, that should be fine, thank you very much.” Alex replied without looking at the wheel, before a man wearing only a white loin cloth appeared from the doors on the left of the desk and silently led Alex through.<br />
<br />
Alex was led to a changing area, where rows of simple chests were lined up. Approaching one of the empty chests, a prompt asking Alex if he wanted to store all his gear appeared.<br />
When he thought yes, Alex felt his heavy armor suddenly lose its weight, as it phased through him, dropping into the chest and disappearing before the chest lid closed by itself. A small flash of white light indicating the chest had been sealed. Then a ghostly key floated up through the roof of the chest, pausing for a moment before it suddenly flew towards Alex, disappearing into his chest.<br />
<br />
Alex looked around, expecting the key to have moved behind him but could find no sign of it, before a small cough from Dimas drew his attention. Dimas led him out through another door into a large chamber with two large pools in the center. Six large arched doorways lined the walls either side of the pools, each guarded by an barely clad men and women, all wearing plain white undergarments.<br />
<br />
Alex looked down and found his own white undergarments had been changed to a dark red, and looking at the other patrons within the pools, could see many dark and light blue bathing suits, which he figured must indicate they were silver or gold level patrons.<br />
<br />
Finally Alex’s eyes rested on a small group of four men sitting together casually chatting to each other. Two of them wore bright green loincloths, the others were a vibrant purple. <br />
<br />
“What do the different color garments mean?” Alex spoke to Dimas without turning his head.<br />
<br />
“The light blue are silver level patrons, the dark blue are gold level. The gentlemen in purple and lime green are a level above the golden, and are not to be disturbed without good reason. Doing so would have you escorted out promptly sir.” Dimas replied in a matter of fact tone, before drawing Alex’s attention to the doorways at the back.<br />
<br />
“You masseuse will send a messenger to provide you your free potion and take you through the end door on this side for your massage at the agreed upon time. The larger pool is cold water, the smaller one is heated. Please relax and enjoy yourself sir.” Dimas dipped his head before disappearing, bowing deeply to man entering the door behind Alex wearing a light blue loin cloth.<br />
<br />
Alex looked around, noting that while the pools had nearly 50 men and women bathing, there was still plenty of space to move around without being intrusive. <br />
Walking down some short stone steps and wading into the pleasantly cool water, Alex noted the ash, sweat and grime that had accumulated on his body disappearing completely as his skin was submerged, yet the water remained crystal clear. <br />
<br />
‘Small details that look like magic but are just part of the games design.’ Alex thought to himself as he quietly dipped his head under the water, allowing his whole body to be cleansed, before taking a seat along the edge of the pool to relax. <br />
Allowing his eyes to close, Alex suddenly snapped his head up, realizing he had almost fallen asleep. Looking around, he found the baths considerably emptier and his fingers wrinkled.<br />
He must have dozed off for a little while.<br />
As he wondered how long he had fallen asleep, a test window popped up indicating he had been in the baths for 90 minutes.<br />
<br />
‘Great. I still have 30 minutes before my massage.’ Alex relaxed again as a small shiver went down his spine. Looking at the small arched windows along the high ceiling, he noticed the light coming on was dimming, and ceiling was dimming, small white glowing orbs along the walls and in the pools keeping the water level well lit.<br />
<br />
“Sun must be setting.” Alex muttered aloud as he waded to the steps, and wandered towards the heated pool.<br />
<br />
Entering and grabbing a seat along the edge, Alex realized the hot pool was almost empty. A familiar group of four men sitting at the opposite and talking away. One of the men in green, A tall, lean man with dark black hair, bright purple eyes locked eyes with Alex, his well defined pecs and abs, rising out of the water as he positioned himself along the waters edge. The man smiled and nodded at Alex, who realized he had been staring, awkwardly smiled and nodded back before the other man broke the eye contact.<br />
<br />
Alex felt uncomfortable. There was something about that man’s eyes that kept his attention locked on him, and there was a faint but palpable feeling of unease in the air. Alex sat there, pondering this as he stared at the ceiling, occasionally looking back at the man as he tried to pinpoint his point of concern.<br />
<br />
Alex was so caught up in his thoughts, that he barely noticed Dimas approach the men with a tray full of different colored vials. The men spent a good time talking to Dimas before each making a choice. <br />
As Alex looked to the ceiling, he did not see the man look at him again, before talking to to the others in the group, and the finally Dimas.<br />
<br />
Alex continued to ruminate, his body relaxed in the perfectly warmed water but his mind busy trying to piece the situation together. He had always been a little bit clueless when it came to figuring out etiquette and using his common sense, yet he was popular and charming enough that people often overlooked his social missteps, usually. Right now Alex was facing a sudden feeling that something was off, and usually that meant he done something thoughtless, although he couldn’t pinpoint what…<br />
<br />
Alex’s thought were interrupted by Dimas clearing his throat.<br />
<br />
“Sir, I have come to collect you for your massage and give you your free potion.” Dimas said, holding out a yellow vial.<br />
(Wisdom DC 10, rolled 12, -2 WIS modifier. Result 10)<br />
<br />
Alex found he was already reaching for the vial when he stopped himself, something was off here.<br />
“Wait, what does this potion do?” He asked as he eyed Dimas warily.<br />
<br />
“This potion enhances physical sensation for a time. It will make the massage more enjoyable, sir.” Dimas replied, his face showing no emotion. <br />
<br />
Alex remained paused for a moment longer, unsure if he should drink the potion, although the sense of unease was from the man with the hypnotic eyes, not from Dimas. Although the front desk said the token would give him a free potion, and he was being fetched for his massage now.<br />
<br />
Alex token the vial from Dimas’ outstretched hand, quietly sniffing it, still not committed to drinking it.<br />
(Wisdom DC 15, rolled 7, -2 Wis Modifier, result 5)<br />
Alex shrugged slightly before tipping the vial up, the liquid within sliding over his tongue and down his throat smoothly as he chugged it. The brew tasted like pineapple juice with a small aftertaste of something Alex couldn’t place, and in a few short moments, the vial was empty.<br />
<br />
“Very good sir. Now if you follow me I shall take you to your massage.” Dimas said, barely looking at Alex as he stood up and placed the vial on Dimas tray, before following the man through the arched doorway, down a short hallway and through a curtain into a small candle lit room.<br />
 <br />
“Enjoy your massage sir.” Dimas replied, exiting with the tray of vials. Alex failing to notice the yellow vial was nearly twice the size of all the other vials on the tray.<br />
<br />
Looking around the room, Alex took in the calming dim lights flickering from the candles, the slight haze from the incense burning at the opposite end of the room, the slight earthy scent both new and familiar as Alex looked at the table in the center, a familiar massage table but with the top mat was a collection of thick pillows stitches together to form the table top. <br />
<br />
Alex felt his skin tingling in the warm air, his senses heightening from the potion. Breathing in deeply, he filled his nose with the scent of the incense, the sound of the curtain parting again drawing his attention to the large, muscular blonde man entering with a small tray of towels and a pitcher of oil.<br />
<br />
“Good evening sir. Please lie down on the table and I shall begin your massage.” The man said in a deep but calming voice. His soft hazel eyes and gentle smile all perfectly practiced to get his guests to relax.<br />
 <br />
Alex laid on the table, his bronze coloured loincloth suddenly drying as he sank into the soft table. <br />
Having had sports massages before, in the real world, Alex had an idea of what was involved, but he was not prepared when the warm oil started to drip onto him. The strong hands spreading the oil over his muscular back and then expertly kneading his muscles.<br />
<br />
Alex found his heightened senses briefly overloaded, as the masseuse worked his lower and upper back, before moving onto his legs. Alex found himself breathing in heavily through his nose, his head slightly foggy as the oil slicked hands started to massage his feet, finding and releasing tension he didn’t know he had in them.<br />
<br />
Alex was losing his sense of time, his mind completely absorbed in feeling every sensation of the massage, and was surprised at how quickly he was being asked to turn over.<br />
<br />
Once lying on his back, Alex found himself gazing up at the masseuse though half closed eyelids, taking in the taller mans figure. The man must have been nearly 7 foot tall, with wide shoulders and large, bulky arms. His large hands seemed to completely cover Alex’s chest as the oil was spread around. The large mans blonde hair was cut very short, almost to the point of being unable to see the color; and across his chest, arms and his left cheek were the faint outlines of old scars. The man was a bulging wall of muscle, maybe forty years old and likely a powerful fighter, yet his eyes were almost glazed over, completely absorbed into his work kneading Alex’s body.<br />
<br />
The older man had now moved onto Alex’s arms and shoulders, working the muscles until they almost felt like jelly to Alex. Then Alex found himself looking directly up into the older man’s steely grey eyes, the dreamy semi focused gaze almost looking through him as his neck and shoulder were massaged, the large hands perfectly supporting his head and working each joint in his neck.<br />
Alex’s felt so completely relaxed he mused that he could almost fall asleep…<br />
<br />
(Multi DC constitution check DC 5, 10 & 15, rolled 19 + 5 CON modifier, result 24)<br />
<br />
(pass DC 5)<br />
…but he was able to remain awake with only minor mental effort. Able to keep his eyes open, while the masseuse spent what felt like an eternity releasing every bit of tension in his body from his neck. His eyes staring through Alex the entire time.<br />
(pass DC 10)<br />
Alex breathed in deeply, the faint smell of the man sweat filling his nostrils, the salty scent mixing perfectly with the incense in a way that made Alex enjoy the scent. As his lungs filled with the aroma again he found the desire to moan rising from within him, but he stifled it. Allowing his lips to part slightly but still breathing in deeply through his nose.<br />
(pass DC 15)<br />
As the waves of relaxation filled him, Alex felt himself sinking into the pleasure of the massage, a familiar tingle in his groin indicating his bodies intended response, yet he was still keenly aware that he was being massaged by a man and that he was straight. So no matter how good the man smelled, or how great his strong hands felt on his body, he was able to stop himself from chubbing up.<br />
<br />
Alex felt his head being lowered onto the pillowed surface as the large man thanked him for his patronage and excused himself. As Alex lay on the table, breathing deeply and basking in the total relaxation of a perfect massage, his ears pricked up, and he could hear faint voices in the hallway.<br />
His heightened senses meant he was able to make out a few words.<br />
<br />
“.……abnormally high resistance…………”<br />
“.………not a satisfactory response………”<br />
“.………Diplomat unhappy…………..”<br />
<br />
Slowly rising from the table, the creaking of the wood table silenced the voices and the sound of footsteps leading way rapidly indicated the sources had fled. <br />
<br />
Making his way into the hallway, Alex made his way back towards the bathhouse and was almost to the changing rooms when one of the young women from the front desk caught up to him.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me sir, I’m so sorry to bother you, but did you receive your token as a reward for helping save a newborn baby from a fire today?”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, causing a relieved smile to spread across her face.<br />
<br />
“That’s great! The owner is inconsolable right now and a selfless member of the order like yourself is just the right person to help us….  if your willing to hear us out?”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, his head still hazy from the massage as he followed the girl down another hallway and up some stairs, too busy staring at her ass jiggling with each step to notice where they were going.<br />
<br />
Arriving in a large upstairs room, a balding overweight man, with grey hair skin bronzed from excessive tanning oil was pacing in the central room, the older man that had given Alex his massage was standing there with his head bowed. As the young women introduced herself, the man stopped pacing, quickly looked at Alex top to toe, then tried to shoo them away.<br />
<br />
“Yes he has the build for it but I thought you were going to bring me a knight, not one of our patrons still hazy after their massage!”<br />
<br />
“But sir!….”<br />
<br />
“No buts Marjorie, now go!”<br />
<br />
Hanging her head she turns to lead you away, but the familiar dialogue wheel appeared with a 10 second timer. Alex didn’t have time to read the responses, but seeing the town guard symbol next to one option he mentally chose it.<br />
<br />
“Guard SteelShield of the fourth district patrols, at your service sir!” Alex said, blinking rapidly to wake himself and stepping into his at attention stance.<br />
<br />
Marjorie gasped as the older man stopped suddenly, turning his head and appraising Alex in more detail, starting from his toes, traveling slowly up his body until they locked eyes.<br />
<br />
“I see…” <br />
<br />
Stepping forward the man kept his eyes on Alex as he talked.<br />
<br />
“Marjorie. How did you select THIS man specifically?”<br />
<br />
“Um, well sir. You see, Gerard gifted him a bronze token, and when he dropped by to see if had had come in, he told me….” The older man turned his gaze on to Marjorie causing the young women to stumble over her words for a moment before she regained her composure.<br />
“He told me how this man saved a-a baby from a fire, charging heroically through the flames, before he..”<br />
<br />
“Enough.” The older man’s gaze softening, his tone suddenly softer as Marjorie’s shoulder slumped.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Marjorie. Please return to your duties.”<br />
<br />
“Th-thank you Mr Vindegrast.” Marjorie stammered as she fled the room all too quickly.<br />
<br />
The older man, despite his short stature and large exposed belly, exuded authority, and as he spoke, he regarded Alex with a piercing gaze.<br />
<br />
“Now why did Marjorie mistake a towns guard for a knight? Hmmm?”<br />
<br />
A dialogue wheel with a 5 second timer popped up, and Alex saw an unfamiliar symbol which he selected at the last moment.<br />
<br />
(Charisma check DC 10, rolled 4 + 3 CHA modifier, result 7)<br />
<br />
“Well you see, um Sir. I’m actually just an initiate, but…”<br />
<br />
“So not a knight…… Yet.” Mr Vindegrast added with a slight sinister undertone. “Now my understanding is each initiate is given a challenge before they are considered for entry into the order. Often based on one of the virtues of the order. What is your challenge, initiate SteelShield?”<br />
<br />
“I have to do acts in service to the people, and gain enough positive reputation for the order to consider me.”<br />
<br />
Mr Vindegrast rubbed his chin for a long moment before speaking again.<br />
“I am need of assistance appeasing an important diplomat from neighboring region of Alkareth. His opinion of us needs to be positive for the sake of several trade routes. Several members of the towns noble council including three prominent merchants will be crying out for blood if their contracts are not signed. The diplomat, Tarith Oren, has signed all but the last contract and it has fallen to me to ensure he has been ‘compensated’ sufficiently for his cooperation. Specifically, he has requested one of our legendary four handed massages. Normally this would not be an issue, except our master masseuses young protege has been kidnapped, and the diplomat is threatening to tear up all the contracts if he does not receive what he has requested.”<br />
<br />
Alex’s brow was furrowed as his head turned putting the pieces together.<br />
“So…. You want me to rescue your protege?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, That would be the second part, but the first and most important part would be to help ensure Mr Oren is satisfied with his massage. Yet while you have the physical stature to pass for the protege, I am reluctant to send in with Billy here….” Mr Vindegrast nodded towards the masseuse still standing silently with his head bowed.<br />
<br />
Another dialogue window popped up, this time with no timer allowing Alex to review all of the options.  He could accept the rescue, decline both quests, or try to talk Mr Vindegrast into letting him assist Billy. <br />
<br />
Having experienced Billy’s massage himself, Alex had an idea of what to do, his body still keenly remembering each and every touch of his massage, but also he knew the standard he would have to try to attain. As he struggled with the thought about which option to take, he thought about what his brother David would have recommended.<br />
<br />
“Just try to pick choices that a Paladin would pick. That means helping people, destroying evil, standing up for honesty, justice and all things good. Those options tend to reward you the most.”<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head as he tried to break the situation down. If the diplomat was angry the city lost trade route, which meant that many of the traders in the market might lose their stalls or even their homes, yet if the diplomat is happy, the trade flows and people get to keep their jobs, maybe even make more money.<br />
<br />
Alex decided, selecting the convince option.<br />
<br />
(Charisma DC 10, rolled 11 +3 CHA modifier, result 14)<br />
<br />
“Mr Vindegrast, Sir. I just received one of Billy’s massages so I know how the service exceeds its reputation, and I know this is important for both you and the town, so with your permission, I will do everything in my power to assist Billy in massaging Mr Oren.”<br />
<br />
Mr Vindegrast paused for a long moment before nodding slowly. <br />
“I have little other choice and the fact you didn’t fall asleep during your massage is a good indicator you will remember what is involved. Very well, Guard SteelShield. Follow Billy and he will prepare you before you attend to Mr Oren. Oh, and Billy.” <br />
<br />
“Yes Master Vindegrast?”<br />
<br />
“Please provide Mr SteelShield with access to the full array of potions used to assist the staff.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, master.” Billy bowed deeply before smoothly ushering Alex through the doorway, leading him into a large room filled with shelves of potions. Billy led Alex to the last row of shelves, taking one of each vial and laying them out in front on Alex.<br />
<br />
“These are the staff potions, and Master Vindegrast has given you permission to partake of the full staff supply. This first bottle makes you more aware of your surroundings.”<br />
Billy said placing a familiar yet smaller yellow vial down on the counter.<br />
“This blue vial quiets external thoughts and allows you to focus on the task in front of you in more detail. Finally this red one makes you temporarily more persuasive, alluring and also encourages more blood to your extremities.” Billy stated, placing his hand on Alex’s shoulder. The heat radiating from it causing the oil on his skin to warm rapidly.<br />
(Wisdom multi DC check 5, 10, & 15, rolled 2 -2 WIS modifier, result 0 Critical Failure)<br />
<br />
Alex looked at the potions briefly before popping the lid of each and quickly down them. He recognized the familiar pineapple taste of the yellow bottle, complete with the strange faint after taste. The blue vial tasted like grapes and was consumed in a few short gulps and finally the red liquid reminded Alex of cheap red wine but he gulped the contents down as quickly as he could.<br />
<br />
As he placed the third completed vial down, Alex could feel warmth spreading from his stomach outwards, his still sensitive skin starting prickling with a little bit more intensity as Billy nodded and led Alex out back down the hallway and into an empty massage room.<br />
<br />
“Now I’ll give you a quick rundown of how the four hand massage will go. I will do the talking, as tonight you are my protege, and should only bow deeply. You should only reply to direct answers with either yes  or no master Oren, or thank you master Oren. I will enter and assist our guest to the table. You will carry the oil tray and once we begin, you need to copy my movements until I gently push you away, at which point you need to work on his legs, down to his feet, while I massage his neck and head.”<br />
<br />
Alex listened attentively, his mind taking in the instructions like a sponge as Billy lay himself on the table.<br />
<br />
“Now, you will give me a quick massage, and you must adjust your pressure and technique exactly as I say. Do you understand?” <br />
<br />
“Yes.” <br />
<br />
“Good. Lets Begin.”<br />
<br />

(				Constitution 10	-5 modifier, roll 4 +5 Con - 5 penalty, result 4)	<br />
<br />
<br />
Alex began the massage, working each muscle just as he remembered his own being worked less then an hour ago. <br />
(Strength check Success)<br />
Each instruction from Billy to go harder or softer followed promptly, until Alex got the basic feel for when he was pressing to hard or soft for each muscle.<br />
(Dexterity check Success)<br />
Going by his own memory with his heightened sensations Alex was able to recreate the massage he received, Billy’s feedback quickly transitioning from constructive feedback, to small moans of “Good” and “Yeah”.<br />
(Constitution check Fail)<br />
Yet lost in his focus on providing a perfect massage Alex didn’t notice his own breathing quickening, his skin becoming flushed and the thin sheen of sweat mixing with the oil coating his skin. The combined scent of Billy’s and Alex’s sweat filled the small room, and Alex felt his heart racing as he took pride in getting such a positive response from the muscular, sexy man he was oiling up.<br />
It was all too soon when Billy stopped the massage, quickly leading Alex upstairs, where Marjorie was waiting with a tray of towels, oil and larger yellow vial.<br />
<br />
The tray was handed to Alex, who realized just as Billy stepped into the large ornate room in front of him, that he was rock hard inside his suddenly white loincloth, and by the looks of things. So was Billy.<br />
