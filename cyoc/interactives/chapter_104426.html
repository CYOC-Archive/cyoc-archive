<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you stared at the terminal, you discovered that you are afraid of what will happen after you become multiple women.  Will you even like each other?  Will you be compatible to be lovers?  What if it turns out you are really just an awful person, and you can&#39;t stand yourself?<br />
<br />
You tried to brush those thoughts away and ignore them.  They nagged at you as you input your request into the terminal.<br />
<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Of course.  You wanted to stay a woman.  That&#39;s part of why you where there.  You like women, and you like being a woman, it&#39;s just other women who don&#39;t like you.  <i>...right?</i><br />
<br />
Limb modifications: None<br />
You had not thought seriously about this before.  You had been too focused on the search for love and companionship to consider changing your form.  It was too late to consider adding other changes.  You could also do that later.  <i>...or maybe you should delay to explore other modifications first?</i><br />
<br />
Personality modifications: Divide into 2 women who will fall in love<br />
For some reason, this scared you more than anything else.  What will happen to your personality when you split?  Will becoming multiple actually kill who <b>you</b> are, and create two new people who are like you, but not actually you?  Is it really worth it to stop being yourself in order to become two someones who might love each other?<br />
<br />
After staring at the terminal for almost 15 minutes, you decided you weren&#39;t ready for those possibilities.  You wanted to find another way.  You didn&#39;t want to risk losing yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you cancelled your order on the terminal and turned to leave, you noticed a sign next to the front desk: &quot;Free Consultations: 9 AM - 5 PM&quot;.  The attendant at the front desk quickly showed you to a Dr Tanner&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
Dr Tanner appeared to be in her late 20s, but she could have been over a hundred for all you knew.  The TF Centers are renowned for being able to make people immortal and cancelling aging.  Her light brown hair flowed in a ponytail over her white lab coat.  She was leaning back into her office chair, and motioned you to have a seat in a surprisingly comfortable chair next to her desk.<br />
<br />
You explained what you wanted, and your fears to Dr Tanner.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, if I understand this correctly, you want to be multiple women who are capable of feeling emotion for each other, but still retain your current personality?&quot;  Dr. Tanner seemed intrigued by your concerns over the divison process, and what specifically you wanted out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I know it sounds a little silly, and probably narcissistic, but it just scares me to think that I could &#39;kill&#39; my personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, we don&#39;t ever... &#39;<i>kill</i>&#39; a personality, soul, essence, or whatever you want to call it.&quot;  She paused and stared you straight in the eye.  &quot;Not only is that type of action against TF Center policy and illegal in all countries where TF Center operates, it&#39;s morally deplorable!  We divide them, duplicate them, merge them, meld them, and even tweak them in some cases, but never &#39;kill&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!  That&#39;s good.  But, if I was divided, then my personality would be divided into 2 new personalities, right?  So I wouldn&#39;t actually be me any more, I would be 2 separate people.  Or maybe 4.  Or 8.  I haven&#39;t decided.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I suppose.  Think of it like a tree, where you are the seed and the 2, or 4 people you become are the fruits that bloom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... That still doesn&#39;t really help me.  I wouldn&#39;t be me any more.&quot;  It was starting to sound like TF Center might not be able to help you, as bizarre as that sounds.  This was the place that has turned people into planets before.  Surely they could do this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.  I think I see now.  Would you maybe be happier as one person with multiple bodies then?&quot;  Dr. Tanner leaned forward.  Her composure indicated she was genuinely interested in your fears, and finding a way to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe?  I mean, I want a girlfriend, with love and actual emotion, in addition to the uh... physical stuff.  And well, I figured that I would divide myself into 2 and would become my own girlfriend.  Or in 4 and have 2 relationships.  I guess I never really thought about what that would entail.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small smile slipped onto Dr Tanner&#39;s lips before she responded.  &quot;It&#39;s definitely an interesting request.  I&#39;m going to talk to some of my colleagues, and see if we can figure out something for you.  I&#39;ll give you a call as soon as I have anything, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t what you had hoped for when you entered the TF Center that day, but it was better than nothing.  You left your number with Dr Tanner and went back to your apartment.<br />
<br />
You split rent on your 2 bedroom apartment with your best friend, Marcy.  You&#39;ve known each other since middle school.  If only Marcy had been into girls, maybe you wouldn&#39;t have visited the TF Center today.  But she wasn&#39;t, and you avoided messing up your relationship with her.  Now she&#39;s a rock for you, and has been incredibly supportive of your plan.  She even bought you a King-sized bed for your birthday this year, in preparation of your division.<br />
<br />
Marcy was on the couch watching TV when you walked in the door.  She turned around to look at you, surprise on her face, &quot;You&#39;re back fast.  What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...  I met with one of the doctors about my morph.  I had some concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?  You never mentioned any concerns before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kinda.. complicated.  I guess.... I guess I&#39;m just scared that if I let them divide me into 2 people, then I won&#39;t be me any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, duh.  You would be 2 people then.  I thought that was the plan?  Did something change?&quot;  Marcy leaned over the couch back and offered her bowl of popcorn to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks.  I&#39;d rather not talk about it.  Please, Marcy, I just need some time to think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Kate.  Just remember, I&#39;m here when you need me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you walked back to your bedroom, Marcy called back after you, &quot;Just remember, you should probably make up your mind soon.  You did borrow money to do that morph, and there are going to be questions if you show up un-morphed to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
You collapsed on the bed, motionless.  Marcy was completely right, you did borrow money.  From Sarah, from your parents, from co-workers, and even from your boss.  They would all want to know what happened, and most likely they&#39;d both want their money back with extra interest AND would never trust you again.  With your fears and cowardice clouding your mind, you could only manage to curl up on the bed and go to sleep.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<b><i>*ring ring*</i></b><br />
<br />
You were awoken by the sound of your phone early the next morning.  A few curse words later, and a trip from the bedstand to the floor later, you managed to get ahold of the phone and answer it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, this is Dr. Tanner.  May I please speak to Kate Ylviosa?&quot;  At the sound of those words, sleep drained away rapidly.  Maybe there is a way...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, good morning Ms Ylviosa.  Is now a good time to discuss your request from yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I&#39;m awake.&quot;  you slurred out as the adrenaline started to spread beyond your brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...  Sorry for waking you.  I just heard back from a colleague who worked out a way to do what you wanted.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s a bit of a catch.  How do you feel about...&quot;</p>
