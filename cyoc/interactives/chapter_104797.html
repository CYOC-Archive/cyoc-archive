<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;AND THE WINNER IS--KEVIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin smirked, as his bros gave him tons of cheers and welcoming pats. He always relished the attention he got from his friends and club mates, especially the hot ones .<br />
<br />
His boner tightened itself, as he stared at the happy faces of tall,  cool-ly dressed guys in college boy clothing, with muscles of different variation , cheering for him. <br />
<br />
The Asian, Korean-American, always relished the popularity, even though his teachers always gave him the most crap for not paying attention in class and not achieving as well as the other students . <br />
<br />
Screw class! The system sucks! He preferred to stick around performing rather than adults who demanded so much for his grades.<br />
<br />
He wiped the sweat of his brow, dancing for a while now. His club was organizing an event whereby others can challenge them and win prizes if they defeated their opponents. <br />
<br />
Kevin smiled gently underneath his specs. Dressed in grey sweatpants, a pair of sneakers and his Dance motion club T-shirt which was underneath his Korean styled jacket. He spun his SnapBack around his orangey dyed wavy hair and was prepared for the next challenge<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sucka! Let&#39;s see your pansy ass moves can own me!&quot;<br />
<br />
A challenger stepped forward, now dressed in a school T-shirt and sweat pants, Marvin smirked as he swaggered on stage, as he performed decent moves which sent the crowd gasping.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the pansy comment, Kevin did, tugging away like some random insult boys playfully. Sure the opposing Asian danced quite well, but he was confident in his moves as he turned to the crowd and smirked at his friends, as he started to dance.<br />
<br />
Kick! Kick! Spin! With all the amazement and power he developed over the years! It was natural to him, of course. But as the arousal he contained belong continued to throb, it began to suck the confidence and experience away, making it...making it....huh?<br />
<br />
He...he couldn&#39;t remember the dance moves! Feeling his movements slow down as he tried to recall them, but the only thing that popped up at a time like this was formulas and lectures he had in school. He felt his feet come to a halt like they became totally unaware of his surroundings. The crowd boo-ed him , declaring Marvin the winner.<br />
<br />
Yet a part of him expected this outcome, that it was foolish to challenge a Dancer like Marvin. Like he wasn&#39;t made for dancing. He ran from the stadium, not noticing his sports sneakers refining themselves to black dress shoes.<br />
<br />
Movements reducing to a brisk walk as a pair of high quality cotton socks wrapped around the soles of his feet, as he headed off to the men&#39;s restroom swiftly.<br />
<br />
He unzipped his Korean styled grey jacket on the restroom sink, not noticing how wet it already was as he groaned in frustration, taking off his glasses momentarily and wiping away his tears with his bare skinny pale arms. <br />
<br />
As this occurs, his jacket and glasses continued soak up more water, feeling the wear and tear as they became worn with age. Kevin placed the glasses back into his eyes, not even realising the more typical-matured adult look it gave him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...never...dancing again!&quot; He shouted, feeling his passion melting away as he crossed his arms sternly. Eyes looking at his reflection which seemed less ginger as the glasses reflected into his eyes. Sending a signal to his brain as his posture straightened and became domineering, like a man whose experienced in his years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I be dancing in the first place? I should be involving myself in Science more often!&quot; <br />
<br />
His pair of grey wooly sweatpants began constructing his legs as they morphed into dark brown dress pants, losing their spring and sauve movements as they sticked to the daily regime he learned from physical training, jogging and running daily to keep fit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why I&#39;ve studied it over the years! It is what I enjoy doing after all.&quot; Feeling his voice developing a changed accent, a mixture of Asian-British with Eastern origins within them. <br />
<br />
He adjusted and pulled his pants higher, erasing any baggy ascents it might have had, as a tight brown belt surrounded his waist with a stereotypical metal Hollow square buckle in the center. He wasn&#39;t different--<br />
<br />
&quot;I was always very much like my peers back in school.&quot; He said, and gave a chuckle to himself, instead of shyness showed awkwardness in situations regarding social media, much preferring to stick by the books and discuss about subjects as well as the typical necessities that a man needs in his life. &quot;They were always reserved and knowledgeable , like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Followers after followers decreasing as though he was non existent, phone downgrading completely to a basic model he just needed to call his co workers and family. <br />
<br />
Feeling a sense of unity as he felt a bubble butt resting firmly on his tush. Legs making sure to mature to tone themselves with age and constant reservist trainings ensure he&#39;d stick to a sheep herded regime that commanders instructed the men to do. <br />
<br />
He gave his crotch a pat, reminding it to abstain like he did during his days of service, as it rewarded him with a permanent tannish, Asian complexion. <br />
<br />
His body cooled itself down, he wasn&#39;t out in the sun or exercising today, in fact he was in air conditioned places the whole day! He shouldn&#39;t be in a mess. He told himself, feeling his body freshen up, with cologne being applied, Cologne of the same brand he liked to use since he was younger.<br />
<br />
He was always like the other men, filling a sense of pride as he puffed his chest out, letting it broaden with a wider back. With arms thickening moderately , but not too much so that it could be just right for his growing age. Hands roughening as they gave his new chest a feel, noticing harder pecs with gentler abs that were toned down in consideration. <br />
<br />
The dance motion club T shirt sewing itself with nice light blue threads down his arms, as it hugged his larger torso, maintained from his years back in the force. Back widening and tightening his shirt, as though he carried loads of cargo ages ago.<br />
<br />
Buttons range down as the letters on the shirt faded away to oblivion, a collar popping down over his neck as he wore a blue light blue dress shirt, which nicely almost competed Kevin&#39;s strict Asian teacher look, with just enough muscle and tons of intimidation to command attention from his students.<br />
<br />
Yes, like Father like Son, or like instructor like recruit. It was a nice experience that he served his nation, being groomed to be proper men that can take care of their wives. Which is why he fully supports it, after all, it brought him his--<br />
<br />
&quot;My...Wife?!&quot; His voice rose momentarily , whether be it of shock or sudden realisation that he&#39;s changed, as he tried to fight the overwhelming sensations his new bodies desired, craved for centuries and ages.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must&#39;ve met her when I was in University? Uni? Why yes! I made it and aced my Uni years and obtained a doctorate in my sciences, specializing in Biochemistry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brain loading with tons of textbook and practical knowledge he studied for over a decade. Eye generating the large chunk of text flooding through his brain and wore down even greater as years flew by, brain capacity becoming something to brag about as IQ rose to stay within the top percentage of the nation. <br />
<br />
His past, obtaining degrees both in the field of science and in his eyesight, feeling really intelligent, like it has always been this way since young. &quot;It has always been this way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I&#39;m good at after all! Never understood why some people enjoy the performing arts....&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt his Asian genes boiling within him, like knights striking away the creativity and individuality.  He was just like the other men in his league, talented in his academics and won numerous scholarships. Being able to work at a high paying job overseas, being a hard worker for himself and his family---his family.<br />
<br />
 He lost sight at what was once special to him as it sucked away his coolness, feeling his body stiffen with age and experience. Eyes betraying his already poor vision, calculative fingers adjusted the lenses, as he noticed two objects on the sink. A watch and a ring.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, his hands reached out for the watch and slipped it over his right wrist. He washed it good after all these years, appreciating the glimmer it shine...it was as pretty as his Wife...he clenched his right fist, as he felt new senses tingling from within that were...satisfying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, why should I complain? I have my life carried out the way that was most beneficial to me, and that was to follow tradition!&quot;<br />
<br />
His dick lost its desire for guys, in fact, he was disgusted at the thought of even being with one of them! Much less them being students in college! It was wrong and foreign ! Such a shame men just can&#39;t follow tradition and appreciate having wives. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am a father to a lovely wife and to numerous children after all. Being an intelligent father with a beautiful wife beside me, with children that I&#39;ve groomed the way I like them. There isn&#39;t anything more fulfilling than this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slid the ring down his finger as he recalled the union he had with his wife, now that&#39;s someone he could not betray. Being married for over 20 years and having fully grown sons serving the army like he once did, scoring perfect scores in their subjects and was as passionate in the sciences as he was. <br />
<br />
They&#39;ll soon become fathers like he is once their out of service and finish their university like the rest of the successful men like himself have. There&#39;s no other way to achieve success but education.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...as Kev...Cha...no that can&#39;t be right. Hmmm.&quot; <br />
<br />
The SnapBack over his head popped off his hair, taking away the dye and the messiness it had as it became a neat black side parting, which matched his older face. It reduced to a string , as it hung over his neck and began solving the last piece of the puzzle. His name<br />
<br />
The SnapBack turned into string as it looped around his neck and connected down the middle around his chest. It materialized his new identification as an ID card appeared, with red accents to show his high ranking. Him having a doctorate, being a Dr, Doctor Percival Chang.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Dr Percival Chang of course, there&#39;s no doubt about it. &quot;He stared at himself in the mirror, boner resting as though it had its fill for a lifetime. He was getting older now, despite looking fresh for his age. <br />
<br />
&quot;BOO YEAH! MARVIN&#39;S SUCH A PRO!&quot;<br />
&quot;HAHA YEAH BRO! THATS OUR DANCE LEAD!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr Percival Chang rolled his eyes at the group of unruly students, not appreciating such behavior in campus. Thankfully his students and children weren&#39;t like that, being the respectful Asians they are. <br />
<br />
&quot;In the end, education is absolute, and only those who follow a strict regime shall prosper in life. Those who oppose tradition shall be nothing worse than men who fool around with other boys .&quot; He spoke out loud, as the college boys noticed and quietened down. &quot;Always works.&quot; <br />
<br />
He smirked, that phrase is what he always told his children, and what his parents told him, as it dates back to generations in his past. It always sealed an argument, with the parent as the winner.<br />
<br />
Working overseas as a Head of department of Science in a top American college, and being away from his children may be a bit concerning, but he is confident that they obeyed his every word. He was a good father after all, unlike the parents of those unruly students.<br />
<br />
Nothing was new for the Dr. , professionally adjusting himself so that he looked presentable, giving a stern glance over to the men momentarily as he headed out of the bathroom. Smirking proudly to himself at his authoritativeness and made his way to his destination.</p>
