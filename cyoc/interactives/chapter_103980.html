<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But it says, &#39;use rubberization should suit be damaged by other body fluids that can&#39;t be cleaned by any means.&#39;&quot; Dereck states to the man behind the phone. Matt wonders what will happen if he&#39;s rubberized will he be able to revert back to normal once his two week duration is over? Or will he be end up being permanent as Dereck&#39;s suit? Matt does like being Dereck&#39;s owner but not permanently... Yet. He wants to debate that to himself once his duration is over. But he also wants to see what will happen to him if Dereck does rubberizes him though. So, he let Dereck decides his fate if he&#39;s going to rubberize him if the man behind the phone allows it.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds of silence, the man behind the phone asks him, &quot;Ok, if you&#39;re going to rubberize your suit, I need to ask you some questions. What made you want to rubberize your zentai suit?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pre cum due to my morning wood.&quot; Dereck answers.<br />
&quot;Is it leaking slowly or rapidly?&quot;<br />
&quot;Slowly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you stuck in your suit? Or can you get out of it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I locked the zipper handles with a small padlock and placed the key on my desk. But I do not want to take it off now.&quot; Dereck replies.<br />
&quot;I see. If you are going to rubberize the suit while in it, you need to understand the consequences.&quot; the man says.<br />
&quot;What are the consequences?&quot;<br />
(&quot;Yeah, what are the consequences?&quot;) Matt mentally wonders.<br />
&quot;The rubberization is filled with specialized nanomachines that turns the spandex material into rubber. Which is OK, but here&#39;s the problem, the zipper track will also be converted to rubber will no longer exist since it will now be rubber. The zipper track will not be regular and can change color and/or pattern with the same spandex you are wearing or own once applied. You will no longer be able to take it off for good.&quot;<br />
(Wait, if Dereck rubberizes me and is still wearing me, I might suffocate him to death!) Matt realizes the problem. (Dereck, please rethink your decision if you&#39;re gonna rubberize me!) Matt mentally panics to him, hoping he&#39;d hear, but can&#39;t.<br />
&quot;However, there is a catch.&quot; The man continues, &quot;The nanobots will realizes an error that there is an organic person wearing the damaged suit and will reconstruct your skin by turning your flesh into rubber, and probably to featureless state for your face, and will be a walking rubber for the rest of your life, so you don&#39;t need to worry about breathing, drinking, and or eating. The other is that you&#39;ll probably no longer fully relieve yourself as a walking rubber, but the pleasure itself w/o the relieve seems to be good enough. Though, there has been a few gimmicks of this since there are people that can speak only to let out a moan or groan in a muffled voice and chances are, your new rubber skin may be sensitive.&quot;<br />
Dereck cocked a brow beneath Matt&#39;s hood and asks, &quot;Has that happen before? And can I still at least see?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, about a few hundred people has and some regrets their decision. Some haven&#39;t. And yes, you will still see. The nanobots will make sure to regain your sights with a clearer vision, but at the cost of losing your eyelids and can permanently see. So if you rubberize now, and need to sleep, you&#39;re gonna need to wear some sort of eye mask.&quot; The man replies and asks another question, &quot;Will you still rubberize the suit, even though you are still inside it?&quot;<br />
(Dereck, I don&#39;t like being rubberized forever, but whatever happens, my fate rests to you.) Matt mentally says as he&#39;s still looking at the desk filled with papers of the zentai suit as Dereck still holds the phone besides his left ear. There has been a pause for a few seconds as Dereck shifted down to his bulge with pre, slowly staining Matt&#39;s checkered crotch that stained through Dereck&#39;s underwear. He doesn&#39;t want to damage the suit, nor does he want to take it off. He&#39;s going to risk his humanity for this, &quot;I will continue to rubberize my suit.&quot; Dereck says.<br />
Matt was a bit upset that he might not revert back to normal once rubberized, but at least he&#39;s gonna be one with his owner for years to come. &quot;Very well then, I just need to ask you one more question, would you like to be remolded into a new shape?&quot; the man asks again. Dereck replies, &quot;No. I will stay the way I am now, thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You may proceed to rubberize then, we will send someone over to make sure you are ok, once the rubberization is complete and give you a second chance to be remolded. Thank you and have fun with your new life as a rubberized zentai.&quot; The man says as both the man and Dereck hung up. Dereck then reached for a packet on the table on top of the papers for the suit and opened up the wrapper. Inside the wrapper, was a small bottle of what looks like rubber gel and an instructions on how to use it. Reading the instructions, all he has to do is place it on where the damage from unknown body fluid is staining at. He gulps his lasts knowing that he&#39;ll be a walking rubber if he rubberizes his suit while still inside. &quot;Well, here goes nothing..&quot; Dereck then opens the lid and scoops it up with two gloved fingers from his right hand and can actually feel the nanobots immediately taking effect. He then rubs the gel around his checkered covered erect bulge and feels a tingle of pleasure go up his spine and into his pleasure center and let out a shivered moan.<br />
<br />
Inside Matt&#39;s head, he can mentally hear the chronivac sounding alarm, warning about an unknown substance affecting his form and spreads. (Oh god, Dereck did it... I might end up being his rubber skin forever!) Matt mentally says as he faintly enjoys the nanobots melding his checkered skin against Dereck&#39;s erect member as the gel seeps through the pre stain and immediately turn to rubber. However, it went not only in and/or through Matt&#39;s spandex surface, it went inside Dereck&#39;s piss slit as the rubberization spreads externally. While this is happening, Dereck then decides to lay on his bed and looks at the tip of his fingers as the spandex that made contact with the nanobot gel turned the spandex into rubber and went down their arm. He also noticed that his two fingers fused together. He tries to pull them apart, but they&#39;re now a single digit as the space between them are permanently sealed and the rubberization continues to spread further on his right hand and leave the remaining fingers separate. Already, the rubberization already smooths out his erect genitals and his scrotum into a nice bulge for a rubbery crotch as he soon rubs there. The rubberization soon spreads to his ass and soon turns his flesh into rubbery muscles as Matt&#39;s spandex converting to rubber soon becomes Dereck&#39;s rubbery skin and then enters from his asshole and then around his ass cheeks making the ass crack then seal up and leave no trace that he has an ass crack. He then rubs his back legs and heels as the rubberization then progress there and up his torso and back. The zipper track then fuses together as the teeth soon disappears and the metallic grey color becomes the pattern of black and white squares and continues upward as the pleasure continues to pulse up Dereck&#39;s spine.<br />
(Oh geez, this is so great, I&#39;m not sure if this is a bad or good idea anymore. I just wanna be Dereck&#39;s new skiiiinnn!!~) Matt mentally groans in pleasure as Dereck is also enjoying this change. Matt mentally hears the chronivac trying to protect Matt&#39;s mentality as best as it could and try to initiate an emergency reversion and shift reality back to normal, however, Matt knows it&#39;s inevitable and hopes it does save his mentality at least. Passed down his knees and lower legs, Dereck and Matt feels their feet tingle as the toes wriggle and fuse together leaving no internal traces of Dereck having toes at all and just a single mass that look like socks on both feet as Matt&#39;s spandex surfaces rubberizes as it follows.<br />
Somewhat halfway through the changes, the zipper track is almost gone as it soon reaches the nape of his neck and rubs his whole body against his bed and still moans. His right arm is already rubberized and only have three fingers and a thumb on his right hand, his middle and index finger fused now wiggles in unison. &quot;OoooOOhhhhhh!!~ Thiiissss iiiiisssss goooooooodddd!!!~&quot; Dereck howls in pleasure as the rubberization soon spread to his left shoulder and down as it follows suit, flesh is turned/fused into Matt&#39;s spandex converting rubber skin as Dereck forces Matt&#39;s gaze down and see external light reflecting on his checkered rubbery skin and rubs his belly with both hands as they squeak in pleasure and Dereck fixes his gaze back up to his ceiling again as Matt can only look at what Dereck sees straight forward. Dereck/Matt&#39;s rubber skin has also heightened his sensitivity and touch and feel and makes him rub his legs and feet together as they too squeak as they give Matt and Dereck a crazy arousal. Dereck wonders what will happen next, will he lose his sense of sight or end up being just an inanimate rubber checker doll with no facial features to identify he&#39;s even human or who he was before, or hope that the man behind the phone what he says is true and be a walking rubber since the nanobots have some sort of recognition of reading what&#39;s inorganic and what&#39;s not. But none of that matters now and just enjoy the last part of his change, his head. Already, his left arm and hand is fully rubberized and no longer flesh inside Matt&#39;s rubber skin just nerves and rubbery muscles now. The nanobots did not mess with his human weight and only made him fuse with Matt and once the changes already reach the base of his head, he said his last words, &quot;Gooooooddddbyyyyeeee humanity, and helllllooooooo rruuubbbbbeeerry l-lliiiiiiffffeee....!~&quot; Dereck hisses. As Matt hears the chronivac that it managed to save some of his mentality and hopefully permanently but realizes that he will soon be cut off from chronivac support and be stuck as Dereck&#39;s skin for the rest of his life. Soon the rubberization reaches for Dereck&#39;s mouth and enters inside his mouth. Once inside it meets up with the other nanobots converting his insides into thick rubber and nothing else, but leaving some sort of vocal chords that makes him moan, groan and/ or squeak in a muffled tone, but at the cost of losing English when he talks. Even the skeleton becomes a thicker rubber than Dereck&#39;s(/Matt&#39;s?) muscles and the mouths soon seal up and, again, leaves no trace and lets out a muffled moan in pleasure. Same thing goes for his nose as it melts back into his face internally same goes for his ears as it sealed up with rubber as well and amazingly can still hear, but muffled like his voice. Then, his eyes were closed and lost sight for a few minutes and then he can see clearly again as the rest of his head internally, becomes one with his new rubbery being. He then stops squirming and is still looking up and only hears his last muffled moans as it shows his somewhat tiredness from the conversion as silence fills his bedroom, declaring the tranformation is complete. He can&#39;t close his eyes anymore and can barely turn his gaze away from the ceiling, nor the fact he can even sleep. He can still move his head and limbs so he knows he&#39;s still somewhat alive. But he can no longer hear his heartbeat or breath (again, only the sound of his muffled voice).<br />
<br />
He slowly gets up and out of his bed as slight breeze from movement makes him moan in pleasure from his rubber skin which is super sensitive. He tries to ignore the pleasurable feeling, as his rubbery feet touches the floor which felt ecstatic to him (and Matt as his rubbery skin), and slides his feet across the floor and went to a full body mirror in his room. What he saw was not Dereck anymore, but a featureless being made of rubber with checkered pattern of black and white squares for skin staring back at him. His body is extremely smooth and featureless like his face, not even facial or body hair is shown as he leans forward for a better look as he rubs his right faceless head and, retreats back. Looks like Dereck(/Matt) didn&#39;t regret this decision at all! As night falls, Dereck decides to go back to his bed and continue playing with himself (and Matt).<br />
<br />
As for Matt, he can no longer hear the Chronivac in his head anymore, he thinks it&#39;s already left him for what he is now and puts it aside and let Dereck rub themselves throughout the night with lots of muffled moans and squeaks.<br />
<br />
The next day...</p>
