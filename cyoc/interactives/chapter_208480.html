<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Percy O&#39;Brien POV:<br />
&quot;I wonder how exactly are they going to do the procedure? I wonder how dad is doing? I know he was cruel to me but I hope he&#39;s not in too much pain&quot; Percy thought as he showed a concern look on the wall where his dad is being kept on the other side. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter? Are you feeling scared?&quot; asked Dr. Juan who is gonna oversee the procedure for Percy<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m a bit scared. Is it painful?&quot; said Percy as he is starting to have second thoughts going to the court in the first place<br />
<br />
&quot;It will feel a bit uncomfortable for a bit but it wont hurt, I promise&quot; said Dr. Juan whose warm brown eyes assured the young guy that everything is going to be okay<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s begin shall we? This will sting a little but I promise it wont hurt&quot; said Dr Juan as he started to inject two large syringes with white fluid on Percy&#39;s ball sacks. These large syringes actually contain his father&#39;s sperm which is gonna be used to fill his emptied balls with new genetic materials. <br />
<br />
The two syringes will introduce his father&#39;s genetic material to his body and more will be pumped later once his body starts responding to the new DNA being pumped within him. This procedure is new but it has been tested to old billionaires who want to extent their lifespan by stealing the youth of &quot;generous donors&quot;. The authorities discovered this procedure, but instead of shutting it down, an underground movement has been established in order to conduct more of these procedures. That&#39;s the only way the old billionaires can continue their rejuvenating procedures so they had no qualms with it. <br />
<br />
Upon finishing the contents of the two large syringes, Percy was left alone for a few minutes and observations were done to see how his body is responding. Usually, there is a 50% chance of the body rejecting the donor sperm, and when that happens, the penis will just cum out the foreign donor sperm and they&#39;ll have to find a new one. In the case of Percy and his dad, since they are direct relatives, the chances of rejection are nearly none. This makes the procedure a lot easier and more successful. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel funny doctor. I feel like I have to stretch for a bit&quot; said Percy as he was starting to feel the effects of the procedure<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s a good sign that your body is responding well. It&#39;s gonna feel very weird at first but you&#39;ll get used to it&quot; the doctor said while taking notes on what he is observing. <br />
<br />
So far the procedure is going smoothly. While Percy is still feeling a bit uncomfortable these past 15 minutes, the effects of injecting his father&#39;s genetic material unto him is having a profound effect on his body. For starters, his height has now increased a few inches. Before undergoing the procedure, he was at 5&#39;5&quot; but now he is at least around 5&#39;10&quot; - much closer to his dad&#39;s initial height. Dusts of auburn body hair has also started to appear from his initial smooth skin. This is far different from the jet black hair that Percy has at the top of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, your body seems prepared to accept the bulk of your father&#39;s genetic material. We will now pump the remnants into your body and this will accelerate the changes&quot; said Dr Juan as more needles pierced Percy&#39;s ball sack. <br />
<br />
Despite more needles piercing his body, Percy didn&#39;t seem to feel anything. That&#39;s usually an effect that patients experience while the changes are undergoing. Their body starts to feel uncomfortable at first, but once the changes are ongoing, their bodies feel tingly yet numb. Some patients even feel a sense of ecstasy while the other person&#39;s sperm is replacing their original sperm. <br />
<br />
Just as what the doctor stated, the changes Percy was experiencing started to be more profound. His height finally stopped changing at around 6 feet, which is Alec&#39;s original height. His body also started to fill out with a combination of fats and muscles that his 46 year old father has accumulated over the years. The hair on top of his head has fallen off, replacing it was Alec&#39;s thinning auburn hair. His father was not completely balding so he still has his full set of hair, but it was much thinner than his original jet black hair. <br />
<br />
Other physical changes included when his emerald green eyes transformed into a darker shade of brown. As more and more of his father&#39;s sperm was being pumped into him, his penis started to grow more and more. His original 5.5 inches started to grow into this intimidating mass of manhood of 10 inches. While all of this is happening, Percy was groaning with a mix of pain and pleasure. The doctor noted that Percy&#39;s voice was going deeper and deeper as more of these changes were happening. <br />
<br />
The last set of changes included modifications to his face. His father&#39;s face is a lot broader and manlier whereas his face has always been more angular and slim. His facial bones started to crack and expand, giving him the broad jaw that his father has always had. A light spray of auburn stubble also filled out his once smooth face. <br />
<br />
The final signal that the procedure is finished is when the penis has started to release cum. That is a sign that the body has completely accepted the genetic material that was being pumped to him. After a few minutes since the last changes to his face occurred, Percy started to moan and cum started to spurt out of his 10 inch penis. <br />
<br />
The cum that was being released was Alec&#39;s former cum, but for all intents and purposes, that cum was now fully his. After his first orgasm in the body of Alec O&#39;Brien, he looked at Dr. Juan and asked him how the procedure went. <br />
<br />
&quot;It went well Percy...or should I say Alec. You are now physically your father. We will meet with you and your father in the briefing area in a while. For now, we have a large mirror in the room for you to check out your new body and all of its assets. Enjoy as everything you see in that mirror is now yours&quot; said Dr Juan cheekily before he left Percy (now Alec) to check himself out.</p>
