<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>For those that wonder what a colopatirone mentioned in the previous chapter could be, apparently in demonology Colopatirone is a demon who open jails. Needing the name of a little known kind of demon, I made a research and found funy to turn him into a whole specice of demons to unlock any kind of locking-mechanism they found. (Hence why Goliath can unlock anything from a distance.)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kamelia didn&#39;t realize that her new host had never seen any of Flora&#39;s angels before one became Faith&#39;s and the other his, nor would (or could) read her memories, she started hating him. A fact that highly interested the Journal of Facts, since it mean her heart wasn&#39;t &quot;as pure as a god&#39;s one&quot; anymore, even if she shared the soul of someone that had such a pure heart.<br />
<br />
That said, the Journal would let her self-corruption do all the work, only intervening if it made her do something that would endanger its continued existence.<br />
<br />
The rogue angel knew, because of Jane&#39;s so called <em>story</em> written in the journal, she would need to write everything affecting Colin in double for it to work. …And would have to do so just so prevent her changes from being reverted anyway. She also knew she needed to make sure she wouldn&#39;t be interrupted, but that was easy. She simply wrote that nobody would interrupt her until she had finished her business with the Journal of Facts, not even by the other angel sharing her host.<br />
<br />
Said book was forced to acknowledge that was pretty clever.<br />
<br />
Kamelia then wrote that instead of Flore being captured by demons and dying, Colin was again witness to a goddess with a water affinity being attacked by demons who wanted to make her one of their own. She was a young goddess but still had two angels, because they happened to be twins. The rogue angel described Colin taking said twin angels as his own, but didn&#39;t precise why. In her corrupted perception of the young human, it probably was in the hope to make his magic more powerful, but the true Colin, being who he is, did it because he needed all the help he could get to rescue the goddess, and the only help available was her discarded angels.<br />
<br />
Of course, he would have given them back as soon as she was rescued, but by the time the two angels had sufficiently integrated with his soul it was too late, the goddess had lost the fight with her new devil and become a demoness. Of course Kamelia wrote that it was only temporary and, before she could hurt or convert anyone, the new demoness would turn back into a goddess, her devil being reborn into twin angels, again. She only wanted to make Colin suffer, not make the other side win!<br />
<br />
As the teenager got back home he found Faith there, helping his sister learning how to use her powers, like every week-end since the teen-star got an angel of her own. Noticing he came back latter than usual, seeming tired and sad, they expressed their worry. In answer, he explained what happened. &quot;I never expected to live through that again, nor would it be with a bad ending this time&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I don&#39;t feel like having two more angels, two total is more than enough. Would you accept to take one of the twins as your own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, identical twins are known for their ability to communicate telepathically, especially twin angels,&quot; noticed Faith. &quot;And while I&#39;m often here since I&#39;m teaching magic to your sister, it won&#39;t continue forever. It would be nice to have a sure way to contact each others. I&#39;ll still have to make sure the other gods won&#39;t have a problem with you keeping the other one, of course. And ask them to complete her bond with your soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin made them manifest outside of his soul. &quot;Ondine, Océane, come forth!&quot; At first glance, the two were identical if you disregarded their hairdo, but the two had very different attitude. Ondine was the calm feminine type, motherly even, with long painted fingernails, lightly made-up face and long hairs in thin braids reaching bellow her knees, while Océane was your typical tomboy, with a short messy haircut and short unpainted nails and a face au-naturel, a bit like Aqua. Although where Aqua is a bit mischievous at time (unlike Colin), Océane is far more serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you want to keep this one?&quot; asked Faith, pointing to Océane.<br />
<br />
&quot;If fact I would prefer to keep her sister, Ondine. If I&#39;m going to have more than one angel, I would like them to be as different as possible. And I think it would be cool to have a more feminine person be part of myself. And it could help me have an easier time understand more peoples.&quot; The goddess was a bit surprised to hear that, but understood. Like so long ago when she gave him Aqua, Faith hugged Colin. But unlike when he returned Hope, this time he gave her Océane without anything in exchange.<br />
<br />
Naturally, with her twisted vision of Colin, Kamelia never expected him not keeping both of the twins.<br />
<br />
Believing he would keep both new angels, she added their former host had been pregnant. To protect their child, its customary for pregnant goddesses (and pregnant gods, their nature making it possible for the males to become a mother) to transfer their child into the womb of their angel, so the kid would be protected, safely tucked into their mother&#39;s soul. But because Ondine & Océane were twins, trying to transfer a child into one of them would inevitably duplicate the child, giving it an identical twin placed into the other angel&#39;s womb. (At least while the two of them shared the same host.)<br />
<br />
That transfer is also something that&#39;s donne very early, sometimes as soon as a spermatozoid entered an ovule, in fact. Since gods and angels are 12th dimensional beings, it take a long time for the resulting mass of 12th dimensional cells to encroach itself into the surrounding 12th dimensional womb, particularly since it <strong>is</strong> 12th dimensional. And baby gods develop very differently from their human counter parts, which Kamelia wanted to use to make Colin suffer.<br />
<br />
The moment they attach themselves to their mother&#39;s womb, be it the actual goddess&#39; or one of her angels&#39;, a psychic bond form between mother and kid. This bond as two role. The first being to help the baby wake up for the first time, their mind already fully formed despite their body still being a cluster of unspecialized cells. The second being to let them speak with their mother and her angels, who will be the baby&#39;s only social interaction for a long, loooonnng time. Kamelia wrote this link would form the night after Colin took the twin angels, thinking becoming a mother would make him wake-up in panic. She even precised the babies were girls, convinced he would have an even harder time if he expected daughters rather than sons.<br />
<br />
Naturally, in the new past she was creating, with his gentle nature Colin immediately accepted the little girl as his own. He did panic, but the source being he not only felt wholly unprepared, especially not for a daughter that&#39;s also a goddess, but also that he would be long dead by the time Ondine would <strong>start</strong> having a baby bump. He panicked so much he didn&#39;t notice the link with his daughter had also caused his bond with his new angel to become full without help from other gods, at the time.<br />
<br />
Even if she hadn&#39;t gained a telepathic link with Colin, Faith would have known. Because she too suddenly became the mother of the baby in Océane&#39;s womb, the twin of Colin&#39;s own, and knew the boy would need help adapt to the situation. She found him in a terrible emotional state, but to her surprise it was ‘only’ over the fact he would be long gone by the time his daughter would be born. In his distress, he made Faith promise that she would accept his angels as her own once he died, and would love and raise his daughter like she was her own, crying. Once she promised, he continued mumbling about how being her best friend, Faith was <strong>the</strong> goddess he trusted to take care of his daughter. He also added he wished she could be his girlfriend on top of his best friend, but didn&#39;t have any illusion of her ever having that kind of interest in a simple mortal like him.<br />
<br />
At first she simply looked at him like he grew a second head. Rapidly recovering, she asked &quot;Do you realy mean it Colin? That you wouldn&#39;t stop being my best friend even if we became lovers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t know why people insist that adding a new layer to our relationship would destroy what preexisted. While I would love to be your boyfriend, it would hurt me if it mean not being friends anymore.&quot; It was Colin&#39;s turn to be surprised, as he suddenly found himself kissed by Faith. &quot;Good. You just gained yourself a date, besty!&quot; said the goddess, winking at her newfound lover. &quot;I&#39;ll contact you later to organize everything. Hopefully by then, my fellow gods will have come to a consensus about who we can tel about our daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, Kamelia would never have suspected her changes would make Colin&#39;s happy, giving him a love life. As far as she was concerned he was scum. She was persuaded he would be utterly miserable, but still found it wasn&#39;t enough and was about to write more, except the Journal of Facts feared that, with her fixation on making Colin&#39;s life hell she might end up being nocuous to the evil book. Especially with  how open was what she wrote. No one could really predict how Colin&#39;s life would actually be changed, but the Journal doubted it would be anywhere near what Kamelia wanted. Said book decided to make here re-write a second time what she already wrote without adding anything before ending his business with the rogue angel.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Colin was still chatting with Amelia. They had been joined by a god who also had a former devil among his angels. Said god explained how, since Aqua was still able to turn her tail into legs, it mean she could also tuck her host into his own soul, but only when and if he wanted. &quot;Something few can experience, even among us gods.&quot; That god also claimed that since Colin was human, with him inside and Aqua outside, she might be able to speak and be heard by other humans. (An angel voice can&#39;t be heard on the 4th dimension. A human host hearing his angel only through their shared soul.) The teenage boy decided to try just when the Journal forcefully concluded its business with Kamelia. He entered his soul and saw the Journal of fact open, a pen falling on it. Ondine was farther away, her back to it, turning only when she heard the soft ‘plop’ of the pen on the book.<br />
<br />
In the outside world, Faith was still looking fondly at the nascent friendship between her boyfriend and Amelia, or rather Aqua and Amelia, a bit surprised it was possible for the devil-turned-angel to put her host into his own soul. With the recent rewrite of reality, she now had Flora beside her, asking in the divine language &quot;You must be pretty confident Colin will ascend, to start dating him. I hope you won&#39;t be disappointed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know his chance of ascending statistically pretty low, and human life look like the blink of an eye to us, but I choose to savor every second of that blink. It better than having any regret, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
But instead of responding, Flora, who felt like Kamelia suddenly developed a profound hatred for Colin, and without apparent reason, tore out her two angels from her own soul, which caused imminence pain, both physically and psychically, before trowing each of them in opposite directions. To her horrors, she discovered that while Rose&#39;s wings were as immaculately white as ever, Kamelia&#39;s had become a pale gray, and seemed to be slowly darkening.<br />
<br />
Even though it hadn&#39;t happened since Lucifer fell, every one present, gods and humans alike, knew what it meant: Kamelia was turning into a devil. Thankfully, Rose wasn&#39;t. If only a falling god was this easily identified… But it wasn&#39;t Flora would need to go through a long series of test.<br />
<br />
It wrenched Kamelia&#39;s heart to see how Amelia, someone who used to think of her as a friend, or at least someone friendly, was now scared by just being looked at by the corrupted angel. Kamelia&#39;s change into a devil would be studied and observed, in the hope to find way to not only reverse it, but also find way to prevent something similar to happen in the future.<br />
<br />
Still in pain, Flora muster her forces to say she wanted Rose to be given to Amelia. &quot;But why, you aren&#39;t becoming a demoness?&quot; Asked the worried woman. &quot;Then it might be just as well that I start over with a new angel. I know how well Rose and you will take care of each others.&quot; Then it was the angel-less goddess turn to be taken away.<br />
<br />
At that time a group of around ten gods, the oldest, the kind that too much angels to be counted, came to Earth. Precisely to the get-together for humans having an angel gone bad. The present humans didn&#39;t know who they were, but they exulted an aura of importance.<br />
…At least until the other gods greeted them like one do old friends.<br />
<br />
But when said old gods and goddesses said they wanted to speak in private with not only Faith, but also Jane, Colin and Amelia as soon she made Rose her own, it seemed thing had become grave.</p>
