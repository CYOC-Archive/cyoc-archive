<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Feel free to add to this if you have an inspiration. I won&#39;t mind.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Intrigued by the accidentally abandoned notebook, you head on down to a nearby cafe with the book, where you look inside, and on the first page, you see a set of rules on it, the first was in larger print, reading &quot;Whoever&#39;s name is written in this book will be transformed...&quot; below that in smaller print were more rules that seem to supposed &quot;govern&quot; the use of this book, if what it claimed to be is real. Below the first rule there were rules such as:<br />
<br />
- &quot;When writing in the TF-Note, have in mind the face of the individual you wish to transform, as to prevent targeting multiple people with the same name. The person with the name written in the book will be transformed 69 seconds after their name is fully written and writing has ceased, unless otherwise specified.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;While writing a target&#39;s name, you can specify the changes to the target. You have up to 690 seconds to write these details after a name is written, or one can write the changes beforehand and then write the name in front of the changes. Doing the latter and writing the name last will allow the transformation clause to stay in effect for up to 6900 seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;If no specific change is written, then the subject will become a young adult futanari donkey that retains their human hair instead of having a mane.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;You cannot turn a living thing into an inorganic object, such as a chair or clothing, as that would terminate their biological functions, and unlike it&#39;s more fatal counterpart, the TF-Note cannot kill. This effect also applies to effecting changes that would harm an unborn baby in a female&#39;s womb, such as trying to make them male or an egg-laying creature while pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;If used on a pregnant female, it does not necessarily change the embryo/fetus inside. The fetus might scale to the mother&#39;s new size, and may develop secondary/tertiary features of their mother&#39;s new form (such as ears or tails, if the mother was made an animal), but are otherwise unfazed by the TF-Note, and because they have not been named yet, cannot be targeted by the powers of the TF-Note.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;Animals named by humans, and humans previously transformed into animals by the TF-Note, CAN be affected by the TF-Note by writing their name in the boom and envisioning their face, just like a human target. However, in the case of humans turned into animals, if another human changes their name, unaware they were once human, you must still use their original human name. If a human changes their name through a legal convention, then that new name must be used.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;The target&#39;s intellect, unless otherwise specified, will change to reflect their new form, but they will retain their memories of their life prior to being affected by the TF-Note, and be aware they are transforming.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;Reality will not alter to reflect the changes caused by the TF-Note. Onlookers will be aware a subject is changing in front of them, and changes are NOT recursive, meaning they do not affect the pasts of individuals whose names are written in the TF-Note.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;An individual can only have their name written in the TF-Note and be changed up to three different times by the TF-Note before becoming immune to its power. As such, make each use of the book&#39;s power to its utmost potential on an individual.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;In the upper right field, one can write the name of a form or document, such as a warranty or petition, and that individual page will transform into a replica of such a page. However, be specific, otherwise, the contents will be wholly random.&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;The pages can be removed from the TF-Note and still function, and the TF-Note possesses infinitely respawning pages, allowing to never run out of pages. However, ripped pages do not mend.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the rules page was ripped off, meaning there could be other rules to this book, if it worked. However, you were feeling an itch to try it out for some reason. The first thing you did, given you didn&#39;t want to write a name just yet, nor did you know the names of anyone in the cafe. You try an experiment by ripping out one of the other pages from the book, which all look like normal single-rule notebook paper outside of the line in the upper-right corner, and to your surprise, seconds later, you see a new page form in the book. You then try another test of one of the rules, writing &quot;petition&quot; in the upper-right field. In just over a minute you see the layout of the page change from typical notebook paper to filling out areas, looking like a petition, including lines for people to sign at. You chuckle when you see it became a petition to never bring back the McRib. You thought you could pass around the petition, but it might seem suspicious if everyone who signed it started turning into donkeys with both male and female genitals, as stated in the rules about what happens if you don&#39;t specify a change or duration. You look on the back of the petition and see it was still the normal lined single-ruled notebook paper on back, which meant maybe you could write possible changes or conditions, and maybe it&#39;ll apply later, but this would come with the pitfall of not being able to watch the results, or know it worked without following one of the signatories for a while.<br />
<br />
Of course, there was a simpler way to do this, you realized. You could look online for someone to target. It could be a celebrity or politician, or someone on the news. You put the petition on the back burner for now and head home, realizing if you did this in public, an astute observer might figure out you might know something is up. A shame. You there were so many people here you could have tried it on, if only you had their names.<br />
<br />
At home, your 46 year old mother Liza, sporting short brunette hair in a pixie cut, acknowledges you from the kitchen, as does your younger 10 year old tomboy sister Andrea, peeking over the door with her long brown hair in a ponytail, but they seem busy making supper. You tell them you were heading upstairs to do your homework, and march up to your room. Locking the door, you open the book as you boot your computer to surf the web, prowling for a viable target. There were many celebrities, but one name that stuck out on your social feeds, the name of a conservative firebrand in American politics, a senator from Texas known for his closemindedness and bigoted opinions, particularly towards women and the LGBT community, a 60-something year old guy named Eric Graves. Right now, it turned out he was live, along with his equally conservative 50-something year old wife Tammy, as part of a five person panel on a cable news network, the two of them spewing their regular vitriol and shouting over the other panelists and the show&#39;s host. You pulled up the live stream of the interview/group discussion on your computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this would be the perfect test!!&quot; you said. You decided to do write Tammy&#39;s name with no modifiers, to see if the rule about writing nothing else worked, and then with Eric, you had an interesting idea. What would be most fitting than the idea of a public donkey show, so for Eric, you wrote,<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric Graves - Transformed into a dimwitted 20 year old blonde futanari bimbo with P-cup breasts on the set of the news show they are on alongside their wife Tammy as she transforms as well, will have mild superhuman strength to allow her body to negate the affects of having such massive breasts, possessing a seemingly impossible waist possible by modifying their organs to allow for them to quantumly digest all food, thus removing the need for intestines and kidneys, and as such the need to defecate or urinate as all biomass ingested will become pure energy inside her modified stomach. Eric will also develop severe rashes if she isn&#39;t wearing scandalously short skirts and revealing tops, but also will not be fazed by extreme cold or heat as a result of her promiscuous way of dress. Eric&#39;s hair will be a platinum blonde down to her thighs, styled into twintails. Eric will be sexily attracted to anything with a pulse, but will in particular have a fetish for donkeys, and will have no scruples about engaging in sex in public. Eric&#39;s clothes will change along with their body.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wait the requisite 69 seconds as you watch them on the news stream. As you sat there, the panel&#39;s host, Yolonda Adamas, managing to get out a question to Eric asking how he felt about the recent spat of book bans and whether this was a First Amendment issue, Eric started, saying, &quot;Well, Yolonda, I think there&#39;s no issue when you&#39;re trying to protect our kids from the smut the radical left is... is... um... doing...&quot; Eric seemed to slow down and start to space out a bit as flecks of blonde began to appear in his hair. Meanwhile, the other panelists stopped and looked dumbfounded as they noticed Tammy starting to look younger and her ears stretching outwards, grey hairs juxtaposed against her auburn locks, which was shedding the silver she had accrued from her age. Grey and white hairs began to poke out from the top of her white blouse under her maroon blazer. As she went to scratch her head, everyone saw that her fingernails were oddly dark and thicker, and her middle and ring fingers looked slightly longer, and Tammy&#39;s front teeth were showing signs of a slight bucked disposition.<br />
<br />
Yolonda was holding her earpiece, quietly asking if there were any technical difficulties, before turning to the Graves, asking if they were alright. Eric, who was looking rather androgynous in the face and like he was in his late 30&#39;s now, said with a slightly feminine voice, &quot;Just peachy...&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the other panelists, an elderly political columnist, Samuel Crowley, suddenly exclaimed, &quot;Are you not aware something&#39;s happening to you? Look in a mirror or something!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammy responds with a slightly deeper voice as a commotion is going on under her blouse as it appeared her breasts were starting to migrate down her torso, &quot;I do admit I feel a little funny.&quot; She fishes her phone from her purse, gasping when she saw her hand looking deformed and hairy, her middle and ring fingers starting to merge as the dark nail on the end was growing, while her other fingers were atrophying away. In her stiffening palms, she managed to turn on the camera app to use it like a makeshift mirror and saw her neck thickening and grey fur encroaching along it, as well as her fully grown ears. &quot;Oh my god!! What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; She dropped her phone, causing her to look down, to see her hairy grey furred legs as her feet began to bust out of her heels, and out from under her suit&#39;s skirt she saw something long and ropey coated in the same grey fur tipped in an auburn tassel matching her hair trailing out from under her skirt in the back, and in the front something was starting to tent the garment in front as her underwear gave up the ghost.<br />
<br />
Eric meanwhile was faring little better, as breasts were starting to grow under his suit jacket and shirt, breasts that were quickly getting bigger than most women&#39;s melons. At the same time, the length of Eric&#39;s pants legs was shrinking, revealing his now smooth and increasingly toned and feminine legs, and as they were withdrawing up his legs, strands from each leg reached out for one another. Eric grimaced as he felt like his balls were in a vice, but this was in fact his testicles retreating inside of him as his scrotum opened to make way for his new vagina, situated right above his penis, which seemed to be getting bigger. As Eric&#39;s waist was slowly exposed by his shrinking shirt, it showed his former pot belly was flattening out and gaining washboard abs as his waistline narrowed, reaching a tight circumference seemingly only possible on cartoon characters as his waist was reaching circumferences of less than 18&quot; as his hips were burgeoning. He was brushing lightening locks from his increasingly hyper-feminine face, but seemed to be getting more spacey and distracted though.<br />
<br />
As you watch the spectacle, almost happy that this proved the validity of the TF-Note, you were disturbed by the sounds of your bed springs and a high-pitched airy giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, OMG!! You&#39;re the mortal who, like, totally found my TF-Note and finally used it!! Yay!!&quot; Bouncing on your bed was this 7 foot tall vapid blonde who looked like and acted like a mix of what you were aiming to turning the husband and wife Graves into; a lady with tits far bigger than her head, golden blonde hair down to her ass, a 14&quot; waist, 56&quot; hips, vibrant blue eyes that oddly reflected a lack of brains behind them, fat plump lips seemingly permanently stained hot pink with a coat of glitter, a tiny white tube top over her O-cup breasts and white microskirt barely covering her big round ass, a gold-studded belt with a star-shaped belt buckle, clattering gold bracelets on her arms, and kneehigh open-toed white boots with 12&quot; platform heels in which she stood and bounced on your bed naturally as if she was flat-footed, but she also had long grey furred donkey ears poking through her long blonde locks, a six foot long donkey tail leading out from under her tiny skirt coated in grey fur and tipped in a golden tassel, and you can see the flat flared head of a flaccid donkey dick flopping just under the front hem of her skirt. &quot;The last person, like, totally didn&#39;t do a thing with it. Made me all sad an&#39; stuff!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?!&quot; you obviously blurt out, distracted from watching the Graves transform on your computer, but can hear the other panelists in panic at the sight as Eric and Tammy were afraid and confused, hearing what sounded like Tammy accidentally braying mid-sentence as it sounded like she was trying to pray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, like, I&#39;m the owner of that totes fun book you got there, but now that you wrote in it, until you either die, get turned into sumthin&#39; too dumb to use it, or give it up, it&#39;s like, yours!!&quot; she exclaims out loud, awfully bubbly and chipper. &quot;My name&#39;s Bubbles, and like, I&#39;m a...&quot; she paused, looking like she was trying to think. &quot;...a Henshi... Hen... Hen-shi-ni-... Henshinigami!! I&#39;m, like, a Henshinigami, a goddess of transformation!! Yay!! Got it!!&quot; She seemed really proud to have said such a long word.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help but notice you&#39;re...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A total dummy?!&quot; she squealed, as if proud of the fact she was an idiot. &quot;Yeah, we goddesses of transformation are, like, total dum-dums because of a side effect of always changing forms, at least that&#39;s what our momma goddess Circe tells us. She said if you transform a lot, you like, get total spongey bimbo brain!! But we transformation goddesses, like, totally LOVE transforming, so all our brains are fried, but we&#39;re like, totally cool with being dummies as a result!!&quot; she giggles again, before adding, &quot;But what we love more than transforming ourselves, besides, like, all the kinky sex stuff it can lead to, is transforming others!!&quot; She then seems to calm down a little. &quot;But lately, Circe says we can&#39;t like, go around messing with mortals like in the old days. So I had a hurty thinky thing, and thought what if a mortal played with my book instead? I&#39;d, like, get the fun of watching all sorts of transformations, and since, like, I&#39;m not the one doing it, I can&#39;t get in trouble with momma Circe!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, um, Bubbles, was it?&quot; you ask, &quot;Care to tell me exactly everything about how the TF-Note works then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like... I forgot, honestly.&quot; she beams, not the least bit ashamed she&#39;s a total ditz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m going to go back to watching the spectacle of the senator and his, or at this point I should say, her, wife transforming, unless...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bubbles&#39; eyes lit up, her lips forming a pert O-shape. &quot;Right!! I do remember I CAN like, give you a cool power to see people&#39;s names if you want; to give you, like Henshinigami eyes, but like, it totes comes with a cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, half my lifespan?&quot; you jest.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, silly!!&quot; Bubbles squeals vapidly. &quot;Like, the power only works for girls for some reason, and I gotta dock like, 10 or 20 IQ points from you too, cuz&#39; like, it works better when you&#39;re not so bright!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You were well above average intellectually, and if you took the offer, it would knock your intellect down to just normal or just barely above average, but there was also the issue of becoming female. According to the book, reality didn&#39;t change to reflect any changes, meaning you would have to explain this to your mom and sister somehow, or else they may believe you some strange trespasser and throw you out.<br />
<br />
You look at Bubble, all the while hearing the commotion going on online...</p>
