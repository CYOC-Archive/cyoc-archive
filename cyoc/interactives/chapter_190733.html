<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex jolted awake, the light of the moon glistening on her face, while her future husband and wife slept peacefully either side if her, Alex gave a light chuckle, leaning down to gently kiss both of their forheads, Smiling as they stired lightly from their dreams.<br />
<br />
When suddenly Alice heard it again, it sounded almost like, music, like a triangle being played at different notes, Alice&#39;s body seemed to respond to each note, gently climbing out of bed and wrapping a silk gown around her like a toga before walking out onto the balcony, unaware of Ryka opening her eye to look at her, smiling a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
Alex looked down below the balcony, to see a garden bathed in moonlight, almost like a spotlight, but at its center was a pulsing white light, its flickering matching the melody that Alex was hearing, but what she did next was enough to make any rational persons blood run cold with fear, almost as if her legs were moving of their own intuition, she lept up onto the railing of the balcony, her heart now racing with fear, her breath light and quick, her eyes wide as she gazed at the garden below, and then she stepped off.<br />
<br />
Alex closed her eyes, awaiting the impact of the stone below, but it never came, upon opening her eyes Alex found herself standing atop a strange large leaf, its entire surface appearing to be made out of glass, yet it had no reflective surface and felt smooth and cold on her bare feet, then the strange platform began to decend to the garden below, the pulsing light growing brighter.<br />
<br />
But then Alex&#39;s body began to sway, almost in harmony with the notes that sung out around her, and then she began to dance, twirling and leaping, never missing a step and remaining graceful throughout her decent, unknowingly leaving glowing white runes in her footsteps, creating a large glowing circle with a crescent moon in the center.<br />
<br />
When she opened her eyes Alex found herself at the circles center, now hovering over the center of the garden, in its center was a tree stump, with silver veins and glowing webs over its surface, its bark Ash white, like a greyed fresh snow, but atop the stump was a type of glowing cocoon, with a shadow of something small moving inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;You came back&quot; came a high pitched small voice, it&#39;s source seeming to come from all directions, making Alex jump and slip on the giant leafs surface, splitting off and falling into a bush below, when she emerged from the net of twigs and leaves her outfit was in shambles, ripped up from tip to tip, so Alex simply let the tattered remains fall to the stone floor, letting her naked form soak in the ominous glow, all while Ryka and Chronos, as well as a few other set of eyes, watched Alex aproching the stump with bated breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you, or more importantly WHERE are you&quot; called Alex, only to hear the small voice giggling, the pulsing light of the cocoon matching her giggles &quot;well I&#39;m not verry far away, I remember when we used to play hide and seek in the palace&quot; chimed the small voice, but Alex&#39;s confusion only grew, but decided to play along to get some answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmmmm....sure, but its time to come out of hiding now, I need to aske you a few questions&quot; called Alex as she looked around the garden, looking between the various flowers and trees for the child that she could hear &quot;fiiiiiiiine but I win&quot; sighed the voice before the light of the cocoon now behind Alex grew brighter, Alex then spun around and jumped back in surprise at the silk balls sudden closeness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you wanted me to show myself didn&#39;t you so....TADA&quot; said the cocoon, now circling Alex as if curious &quot;hi there ummmmm, magic ball of yarn?, ummmm what&#39;s your name&quot; Asked Alex, the cocoon only rolled around through the air, letting out loud laughter before coming to a halt, it&#39;s glow becoming dim &quot;my name.......my name......the name you gave me when I was born......what was it&quot; the child&#39;s voice seemed sad and distant, sounding like someone trying to recall a dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmmm well how about I give you a new name, the cocoon suddenly lit up brighter than before, jumping around as it suddenly came loose from its stump teather, suddenly growing larger, mutch larger, if Alex had to guess it was around the size of a prize winning mellon &quot;yay, yay a new name, I get a new name I get a new name&quot; chanted the child&#39;s voice before lowering itself to the floor infront of Alex as if waiting for her reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmm.....let&#39;s see&quot; muttered Alex as she began pacing back and forth in thought, looking to her surroundings for inspiration, untill a lone flower that blossomed brightly at the stumps base caught her eye, Alex smiled and then leaned down and heaved the cocoon into a warm embrace, her breasts squished firmly against its soft cool surface, pressing her cheek against its surface, not flinching when she felt what felt like a young child&#39;s hand press back &quot;from now on your name is Lilly, my little Lilly&quot; as soon as those words were spoken, Alex could feel an undiscribable bond with what she held in her arms.<br />
<br />
But soon that bond began to feel stronger almost physical, untill Alex&#39;s midsection jumped forward towards the cocoon, its pulsing now seeming to match her own heartbeat as what felt like a cord of silk now connected the silk cocoon to her abdomen, and yet oddly Alex felt no fear, if anything she welcomed it, even going as far as to hold it tighter against her lower stomach, like her body and mind knew what to do.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s posture began to change, beginning to arch her back as the cocoon seemed to deflate in her arms, until there was nothing but a silk webbing over Alex&#39;s body, yet somehow it seemed to keep its shape over her abdomen, curiosity got the best of Alex as she then parted the webbing from herself to reveal a translucent blue glowing surface, soft to the touch, and what was odd was that Alex seemed to be able to feel what was on it, so she began removing more and more of the silk until her snowy skin was bare one more.<br />
<br />
In Alex hands she now cradled what she assumed to be her new abdomen, a large, glowing, swolen orb that weighed heavily on her hips, she cerressed her belly gently, once again finding no panic, confusion yes, but she was not afraid, if anything she felt an odd devotion to it, and that&#39;s when she felt and saw it, a small human arm stretched out from within her new form, pressing out against her new sensetive translucent skin, and when Alex followed the arm down, it was attached to a small child, now nestled against the walls of her new womb, from what she could guess, the child must have been five, maby six, curled up tight in her pregnant belly, Alex then let out a groan as the child within her yawned and stretched out all of her limbs, surprising Alex with having four arms, and not two.<br />
<br />
Alex staggered back until she was resting against one of the gardens marble pillars, holding her new swolen womb as the child within her wriggled around, Alex was left groaning and panting as the child finished its acrobatics &quot;jeez kid nnnggghh, got one hell of a kick to you don&#39;t you&quot; chuckled Alex brethlessly as she petted the underside of her maternal swell.<br />
<br />
Once Lilly had calmed down Alex heaved her pregnant form from the ground, groaning as she leaned back, letting her new babies weight rest in the bowl of her pelvis, pressing her palms into her spine to try and relive some of the strain before smiling down at her new bump, running one hand in slow wide circles along its surface &quot;well then little one, my future wife and husband have some explaining to do&quot; she said as she then looked up to see Ryka and Chronos smiling down at Alex from the balcony above......</p>
