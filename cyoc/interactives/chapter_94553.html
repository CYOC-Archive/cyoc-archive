<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck off, Professor Hart,&quot; Charles said, with a sneer.<br />
<br />
The teacher was aghast.  &quot;Watch your language!&quot;  But then suddenly it hit him.  That voice!  &quot;Charles?&quot;  Now looking at the Goth boy with more scrutiny, Professor Christopher Hart realized that it really was him.  And the other Goth boy, who was holding hands with him (disgusting!), looked like Andrew, another student of his.  But what happened to them?  He just saw them a few minutes ago.  They looked totally different!<br />
<br />
&quot;I demand to know what&#39;s going on here!&quot; Professor Hart yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna know what&#39;s going on?&quot; a voice asked.  Christopher Hart turned and saw a skater boy off to the left.  In his hand was a small device.  &quot;Then I&#39;ll show you.&quot;  He was doing something with the device, then Christopher started to feel strange.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself in shock, seeing that his suit jacket was fading away.  That was impossible!  Then he watched as his tie parted from his white shirt, which crept downward from his shoulders to his waist (the sleeves fading to nothing), changing color and material.  He reached up and touched his tie, which had migrated to his neck.  Already, the material felt different, like ... leather?  Looking back down at himself, he saw that whatever was left of his shirt had become a tough black material (latex), wrapping itself around his waist, keeping the rest of his chest completely bare.  In fact, it kind of reminded him of a corset ... but that couldn&#39;t be.  Men didn&#39;t wear corsets.  His body then became paler until it looked like he barely went outside.  And then his body got lankier, looking like he never did any exercising, and practically starved himself, but wasn&#39;t skin and bones.  Looking back down at his clothing, he watched as the legs of his slacks merged together, becoming what looked like a skirt.  He stared with wide eyes.  A corset?  A skirt?  Was he becoming a woman?  The color and material of the skirt, which ended at the top of his now-black-leather boots, changed to black vinyl.<br />
<br />
Christopher looked at the skater boy, a pleading look in his eyes.  And that was when he felt his hair growing out atop his head, longer and longer, until he could feel it touching his bare back.  Grabbing a handful of it, he saw that it was completely black and kind of scraggly.  He also noticed that his fingernails were now painted black.  What he didn&#39;t see was that he now also had black lipstick and black eyeliner.  A pinching sensation caught his attention.  He looked down in shock, seeing that his nipples now each had a ring piercing in them.  Then he felt something like a thousand needles on his back.  He couldn&#39;t see, but he now had an elaborate gothic tattoo from shoulder blade to shoulder blade.  Wondering what his tie had become, he reached up, only to feel what he could only think was a collar, with 1-inch long metal spikes protruding from it.<br />
<br />
He was so in shock that he felt like he was about to scream.  This skater boy turned him into a freak!<br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, there was nothing wrong.  This was what he always wanted, wasn&#39;t it?  He smiled wickedly.  &quot;Thank you, whoever you are.  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not that uptight prick anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.  And the name is James, by the way,&quot; the skater boy said.  &quot;Anyone else?&quot; he asked the two boys who were still standing behind the former teacher, but looking like they wanted to run away.<br />
<br />
The two boys looked at each other, then finally ran away in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess not,&quot; James said, shrugging.<br />
<br />
Christoper looked over at Charles and Andrew, seeing them not only holding hands, but now kissing as well.  A few minutes ago, that would have turned his gut, but now ... he was actually kind of jealous of the kind of relationship that they now had.  And that was when he finally realized that James hadn&#39;t just turned him into a Goth, but had also turned him gay.<br />
<br />
He turned towards James.  &quot;Could you give me someone to love?  Someone like me?&quot;  He yearned for the touch of another man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; James said.</p>
