<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With September coming to an end, there were other things that were ending with it. Such as Tyra and Rex&#39;s extended honeymoon. They&#39;ve had a very lovely time on the Mediterranean coastal side of Spain, but it was time to return back to Dinosaur City. After the long flight back, it felt like the drive was longer than normal. &quot;It&#39;s too bad that there ain&#39;t any airports closer to Dino City,&quot; grumbled Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s just no room for a landing strip,&quot; said Rex, &quot;But we knew that when we were planning out the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, maybe we could get a helicopter pad,&quot; said Heather, &quot;It&#39;d be just like Jurassic Park.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, except I doubt there would be many commercial helicopters that could carry the likes of us,&quot; said Rex, &quot;In fact, I&#39;m not sure if there are any military helicopters that can carry more than one of us at a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d think someone would have by now,&quot; said Tyra before looking under her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seein&#39; if my tanline is noticeable,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra, you don&#39;t have a tanline,&quot; said Heather, &quot;You don&#39;t tan. Even if you did, I don&#39;t think it would be a big change in color.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how comes I have to wear sunscreen?&quot; retorted Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you would have liked the results if you didn&#39;t wear sunscreen,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn. I was hopin&#39; to show off my tan, especially at the new club,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra, you&#39;re not planning on still being a club dancer, are you?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I ain&#39;t heard any endorsement deals comin&#39; in yet,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you realize you&#39;re going to have to tone down your wild side now,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just because your ol&#39; granny is gonna be movin&#39; in next door with her new hubby?&quot; asked Tyra mockingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that. But you are going to be a mother again,&quot; said Heather pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, breeding season won&#39;t be for some months yet,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I guess I oughta start easin&#39; myself back,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;At least we&#39;ve had plenty of practice with breedin&#39;, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Effie, not right now,&quot; groaned Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late, she&#39;s already reminiscing,&quot; said Rex. Heather was already lost in thought, looking back at her honeymoon.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Their trip to Spain wasn&#39;t all about sex though. Tyra really loved the beaches at this part of Spain. The Mediterranean Sea was very nice this time of year, not too hot, though it was warmer because of the rather dry summer. &quot;Sure is good beach weather,&quot; said Rex, looking up at the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;You mind giving me a hand with my sunscreen?&quot; Rex turned to look at his new wife. Not surprising, she had removed her bikini top and rolled onto her belly, only her arms keeping her covered.<br />
<br />
Rex sighed and said, &quot;Tyra, you know this isn&#39;t a private beach. You can&#39;t go topless here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no one around but us,&quot; said Tyra suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;There could be beach-goers coming along at any time. Now get your top back on,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
Tyra sighed and said, &quot;Fine. But I get to take it off at Irena&#39;s pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Irena doesn&#39;t have a pool,&quot; said Rex pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she ought to build one to go with her villa and the Animalia colony that&#39;s gonna be here. So when we come back, I&#39;m goin&#39; topless there,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t count on it,&quot; said Rex dryly, &quot;Are you going to get in the water?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, might as well,&quot; said Tyra after she got her bikini top back on. Then the two Dinotopians headed for the sea.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Some time later, they returned to the villa. &quot;Hey, Heather, we&#39;re back!&quot; called Tyra, &quot;You oughta go out and... Where is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably has something to do with this,&quot; said Rex, handing her a written note.<br />
<br />
Tyra read the note, &quot;Gone out with Irena to look at the landscape. I was thinking of doing a little painting. After we get back, we can go out for... payla?&quot; Tyra struggled with the foreign word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paella,&quot; said Rex, &quot;It&#39;s a rice dish they have here. I hear it&#39;s very delicious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Heather and Irena went out to paint the landscape,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think Heather did that kind of painting,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. Think she&#39;s tryin&#39; ta expand. But that means we&#39;re here all alone,&quot; said Tyra suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra, we shouldn&#39;t do it right in- And you&#39;re already naked,&quot; said Rex flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is our honeymoon, big boy,&quot; said Tyra, posing seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re in the middle of Irena&#39;s living room,&quot; protested Rex, though his trunks had a noticeable bulge in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s take it to our room and have fun,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s our honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...alright,&quot; said Rex. Even he had to give in temptation. Pulling down his trunks, his considerable tyrannosaurus penis sprang into view. &quot;We&#39;re still doing it in our room,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wherever or whatever you say,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;I just want that tyrant lizard king&#39;s scepter in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes I can&#39;t tell if your sex talk is creative or horrible,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop dawdlin&#39; and get up to our room!&quot; roared Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, you&#39;re the queen,&quot; said Rex. <i>&quot;The drama queen,&quot;</i> he thought.<br />
<br />
Even so, both them were definitely enjoying it when Rex was pounding deep into Tyra. If Irena hadn&#39;t gotten a super-king-sized bed with Dinotopian reinforcement, they would have broken the poor furniture with the energetic mating. &quot;God, Rex, your dick&#39;s a perfect match!&quot; gasped Tyra as he thrust into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve taken your pussy after a T. Rex?&quot; asked Rex slowing down his thrusting enough to keep her on edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve got the cunt of a T. Rex and you&#39;re-&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra!&quot; snapped Heather.<br />
<br />
Tyra snapped out of her memory and snapped, &quot;I was just getting to the good part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re already here,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we haven&#39;t-&quot; started Tyra before Rex pointed out the bus&#39;s window. Tyra looked out to see they were in front of their house in Dinosaur City. &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy was there to meet them. &quot;Hey guys,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;Enjoy your vacation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so,&quot; said Rex as he and the <i>Syntixisaurus</i> girls got out of the bus, &quot;Anything new happen around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s been talk about what we&#39;ll be doing for October,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;I don&#39;t know what Dinosaur City is doing for Halloween, but I know what Lyre is doing. The Renaissance Fair is going to be a part of Spookyville.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Rex, &quot;I would have thought they&#39;d do the Fair earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there were some schedule conflicts, not to mention this being an unusually hot autumn right now. But I think they can work together. I hear they&#39;ll be having an animatronic dragon that will... Heather, is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Heather has spend a few weeks away from her mate, which was a bit frustrating. Even more so since Tyra took every opportunity she could to have sex with Rex. That alone would have been enough to build up quite an itch in Heather. But Heather was looking Jeremy over, how he was a little bulkier than she had lost saw him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy, my granny and her new hubby won&#39;t need help unpacking,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, pardon?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just taking my luggage back inside,&quot; said Heather, &quot;And then I am going to review everything that Mr. M. has been teaching you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Heather-&quot; started Jeremy, but Heather was already pushing Jeremy back to their house. She shoved him through the front door and slammed it shut behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she says I&#39;m shameless,&quot; said Tyra, shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she hasn&#39;t been alone with him for quite a while,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither have we,&quot; said Tyra suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were together last night,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and now you&#39;re going to carry me over the threshold and into our bedroom,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
Rex sighed before picking up his wife. &quot;You&#39;re insatiable,&quot; he said before kissing her on the snout.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you love that about me,&quot; said Tyra as he carried her in.</p>
