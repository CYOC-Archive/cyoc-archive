<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After getting a larger meal that morning than usual and heading out with the jacket on to see how things were now that he was a big, stocky jock, it seemed Eric had his answer about what he was gonna do between going on a diet and learning to appreciate his new build. People gave him space, treated him with much more respect now, and yeah, even though he was kinda fat still, the girls gave him looks due to all the muscle he had going on. And seeing as this was just the start of the weekend, Eric had a lot of time to really appreciate all that the jacket gave him.<br />
<br />
The jocks around town seemed to not regard him as a punching bag or someone to simply look past, and responded to him like he was one of their own. In no small part because of how he was dressed now. And that was really giving Eric quite a thrill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man,&quot; said Derek, one of the Juniors on the football team, &quot;Haven&#39;t seen you around before. You on the team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not currently,&quot; Eric responded, and grinned, &quot;I was thinking about applying to get on the team. You think I got the build for it?&quot; He followed that up by flexing his arm, which, even with the jacket on, produced a very sizable bulge under the sleeve. Derek and the other jocks with him whistled and said a few admiring things about his arm size, and Eric did admit the feeling of being admired rather than scorned was like energy straight to his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, bro. Definitely. You up to hit the gym later at 20 Fitness? Me and the dudes are gonna be hitting chest and arms. Seems like that and legs are your thing.&quot; Derek said, seeming pretty eager to hang out.<br />
<br />
Eric thought about it and nodded quickly, not even doubting the decision, &quot;Yeah, sure man, sounds pretty sweet. I&#39;ll head down there.&quot; 20 Fitness was where all the jocks at the school worked out, so getting invited to workout there was a pretty high honor, he guessed. Eric supposed it was natural he&#39;d start hanging out with this crowd. After all, he wasn&#39;t the short little fat guy any more. He was tall, strong and all man now.<br />
<br />
As the jocks left to keep going on their way, Eric wondered how he could&#39;ve ever doubted how good this was for him.<br />
<br />
In fact as he walked around wearing it over a shirt that was feeling really pretty snug, Eric started to wonder what might happen next. Could the jacket keep going on him and make him even bigger somehow? Make him even stronger? He was honestly of two minds about this. On the one hand he felt like he could really do without adding more fat to his build. He was already a huge, stocky linebacker type. On the other hand, if he kept getting bigger he was gonna be able to keep distinguishing himself. And would taking a bit of fat with that really be so bad?<br />
<br />
And there was his hunger again. Eric did admit that one possible downside to having this much beef on his bod was probably the sheer appetite. Well, there were plenty of cafes around here he could get quick and on the cheap. And so he went off to try and find somewhere with food that&#39;d keep him full for a while.<br />
<br />
Eric first of all headed over to a cafe and upon being seated noted that the waiter, a cute and petite girl, really seemed to be checking him out. Or maybe she somehow recognized him, and wondered how poor little short Eric had suddenly become this riveting, muscular hunk? At first Eric would not have thought about trying to ask somebody out. Chances were they&#39;d laugh at the idea. But now, now he had presence. As Eric looked at the drinks and food available, he picked out what he wanted.<br />
<br />
As the girl came back over, Eric said, &quot;Okay, I think I&#39;d like to have four of the turkey, bacon and salad sandwiches, and an ice coffee mocha.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took down his order and then looked at him rather more boldly, &quot;So, are you new around here? I think I&#39;d remember seeing you around town. You on a sports team?&quot;<br />
<br />
Figuring he could go ahead and say so, he nodded, &quot;I&#39;m gonna be joining the football team. I guess you could say I&#39;m new in town. Really looking forward to getting on there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think anyone would look past you for that,&quot; she said and then wrote something down on a piece of paper, handing that over to Eric as she went off to fulfill his order. He looked down at the piece of paper, which contained her phone number. He felt like shouting with glee - no girl had ever apropos of being asked given him her number...but as he sat there Eric started to feel odd. It was like a gurgling feeling in his stomach.<br />
<br />
A weird feel all through him as he sat there, trying to stay still. Realizing what he was wearing and the effects it had on him, Eric excused himself to go to the restroom. As soon as he was inside, Eric took off the jacket to get a look at himself...</p>
