<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The motel had the smell and sound of one thing, and a good part of William&#39;s mind wanted nothing more than to not be there. It smelled like sex and his black tipped triangular ears could hear others having sex in other rooms. It made part of him wonder if ALL were-beasts had a high libido and they simply went about it in different ways. Not that Yvette really cared. She lay there beneath him and with a wide grin as her face pushed forward into her pointed fox-like muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on big boy,&quot; Yvette smiled, &quot;take me and claim me as yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t mine,&quot; William answered slowly, &quot;This is... is... this is only to complete my transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that he thrust his fully erect member into her, making her impressive breasts bounce slightly with the impact. And despite his claim, the vixen continued to smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll... ohhhhhhhhhmmmmm... change when you cum in me!&quot; Yvette declared, defiant that her schemes could be undone.<br />
<br />
William didn&#39;t answer but frowned as he thrust into her, though beyond holding her down, he didn&#39;t do much more. A part of him desired her to complete his transformation, but that was really about it and about all that he let out. Regardless, though, she was tight and her vagina had a strong grip on his penis as he thrust into her. Each thrust sending her bosom bouncing up and down. The sight of that alone aroused him further, if that was possible, but he did his best to keep his focus away from Yvette and on what he had to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on...&quot; Yvette moaned beneath him, &quot;Aren&#39;t I good to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She then reached up and gently rubbed his now much more muscular chest and then along the sides of his body. Her hands didn&#39;t stop until they reached the base of his brush like tail. The sensation of her hands there almost made him cum then and there, though he didn&#39;t as his knot hadn&#39;t penetrated her yet. That gave him a mental note that werebeasts with tails had an erogenous zone at the base of their tail, which was probably the result of the tail being an extra limb. It created a sensitive area where nerves were closer to the skin, and a question went through his mind if Martha as a werecat would have a similar erogenous zone at the base of her tail in her werecat form.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... does... feel... goooooood,&quot; William moaned, trying to remember that he only wanted her to complete his transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then use your instincts,&quot; Yvette smirked to him, &quot;use your skill as a werefox and help me cum... and then you&#39;ll cum too. That&#39;s what we both want.&quot;<br />
<br />
William brought his hands up and carefully caressed her breasts for a moment and heard her moan as a result. As he then crouched low to actually suck and nibble at her teat-like nipples, he heard Yvette moan even harder and he also felt his knot began to press into Yvette&#39;s lower lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhh... ohhhh yeeeeeesssssss!&quot; Yvette moaned, &quot;harder! Fuck me harder! You know you want it!&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued to thrust into her, and he could now feel his knot gain more and more penetration, and then finally his knot achieved penetration and William and Yvette both gave a series of yips announcing their near simultaneous orgasm. As he began to come down from it though, William found two things. One was that he was stuck in Yvette. Her vagina had a firm grip on the narrow piece of his penis that was behind his knot. The other was a series of flashes and memories, and even desires. And they were all of Martha. Martha and him when they first met, when he pursued her because of her wide hips, a C cup chest, beautiful brown hair and a cute face. Martha and him over some of their dates when he learned they shared some similar likes, his work as a college professor and Martha&#39;s as a elementary school teacher. Martha and him at their wedding, her belly pushing slightly forward with Nate then developing in her womb. Martha with Nate in her arms as an infant. Martha with a young Nate beside her and Eric developing in her womb. <br />
<br />
And then Martha forgiving him for what he&#39;d done wrong. That last thought made him lower his ears, even with the physical pleasure he had just felt. He had truly loved Martha, but  had taken advantage of her and never seemed to realize it. He either let himself get drunk and then having an affair with a student or he had too easily gave in to temptation when Martha had been busy with something other than him, and yet Martha had been far more faithful to him the he had to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong big boy?&quot; Yvette asked to him, &quot;Realize that I&#39;m better than that cat-lover?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take that back,&quot; William snarled at her, baring his teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Yvette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha has stayed by me through ALL my mistakes and all the stupid shit I&#39;ve done,&quot; William answered, &quot;most women would have divorced me after first learning that I&#39;d been unfaithful to her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She probably wasn&#39;t good,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;her mind wanted pussy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her sexuality is NOT the issue here,&quot; William answered, and tried to pull himself free, but they were still tied together. Though, thankfully his mind did seem fully together. His transformation was complete, &quot;I may have dated her because I found her sexy... and I may have cheated on her because I wanted sex at a time she didn&#39;t... but I did marry her for love. I do love her... and I did hope that coming here would be a new start for us and I could put my mistakes behind me and start over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you&#39;re both cheating on each other,&quot; Yvette pointed out, &quot;unless you&#39;ve divorced...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave her permission to be with the Twists when she wants,&quot; William snarled, he barely noticed an angry red glow in his eyes which hid his slit like pupils, &quot;because she probably deserves it... I pulled stupid stuff in the past and yet she stood by me... And that was surely more from love than lust... and that seems to be all you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette blinked for a moment, and then remembered werefox&#39;s nature. While werefoxes were known for their extremely sexy males and females and were the most open about their very active sexual lives, when a male werefox had a bonded mate, that male became very loyal to that mate. She&#39;d never figured that William&#39;s past relationship would matter, as he had cheated on Martha in the past and from what she had observed in her efforts to spy on the Anderson family, Martha seemed to be at least sexually curious with their werecat neighbors. She had figured that their marriage had been essentially a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot; when Nate was conceived and they had only stayed together out of some decision to look like a normal family. Thus, when William changed, he would bond to her and she would get a mate that would protect and love her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bonded with that cat-lover?&quot; Yvette gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I loved her long before I came to Moon Lake,&quot; William answered, &quot;my stupidity has nothing to do with that...&quot;<br />
<br />
William kept his eyes on Yvette as she looked at him with shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;And even IF I didn&#39;t love Martha... what makes you think I would love you?&quot; William demanded, &quot;YOU made the moves on me, and I rejected them politely. You attacked and tried to rape me, infecting me in the process and thus FORCED this... Where in all of that is anything beyond lust?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She won&#39;t love you,&quot; Yvette threatened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure she will,&quot; William answered, &quot;because when my knot goes down... I&#39;m going home. And I will be her faithful mate in all things... which I should have been even before I came here. It may take me a while to convince Martha... and probably longer to get on the Twist&#39;s good side... but I&#39;ll do it. Because... now... now I will be faithful to the mate that I love.&quot;<br />
<br />
In an odd way, he wanted to thank her as the completion of his transformation seemed to help him fully realize just how wrong he had been in the past and how important Martha truly was to him, but he didn&#39;t want to give Yvette the satisfaction of knowing that her ideas for getting a mate had helped him.</p>
