<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(author&#39;s note: I know today&#39;s Thanksgiving and I should&#39;ve added it to my story. however, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to add it in.) <br />
<br />
Kira&#39;s day had been mostly uneventful. like yesterday her changes had only affected some of her daily life. this time however she found herself eating more meat and lunch than before. gym class was also better. She had improved just enough to where people wouldn&#39;t think she was using drugs to improve her performance.  <br />
<br />
after going home she got her purse and walked to the bus stop. she had only turned 16 2 months ago so she still had to wait 4 months to take the driving test. on the bus, Kira smelled a whole lot of new smells. at school, she could smell something but it was hard to discern what. now in a half-full bus, she could figure out what it was.  <br />
<br />
She was smelling humans. She couldn&#39;t tell much but she knew it was those around her. After getting off the bus she headed to the mall. once inside she went straight for her favorite clothing store. she then proceeded to buy several duplicates of her nighttime clothes.  <br />
<br />
she could&#39;ve just slept in the nude but she didn&#39;t like the idea. after paying for her clothes she left. she was moderately surprised at how light her arms felt while carrying the bags. she couldn&#39;t help but feel better about this. apart from her beast form, this had no drawbacks.  <br />
<br />
soon after she was passing the food court she heard her cell phone ring. sitting in one of the many chairs in the area. &quot;hello?&quot; Kira asked. soon she heard the voice her her best friend on the other end. &quot;Hey Kira where are you? I thought we were going to find that cave?&quot; Sarah asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;oh sorry, Sarah I totally forgot. um, I&#39;m at the mall,&quot; she said a little nervous. while she was starting to accept what had happened she was worried her friend wouldn&#39;t. this was worse than if people found out she was a closet tomboy.  <br />
<br />
She could be hunted down like witches in Salem if they saw her beast form. so she told some of the truth. &quot;sorry I couldn&#39;t find it again. I followed the same path I took but it was like the cave never existed,&quot; she explained. again she made no mention of the voice and her changes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;well that&#39;s disappointing I was hoping to find a totem like great grandpa. Anyway, let&#39;s just hang out tomorrow. goodbye,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;goodbye see you then&quot; they hung up. Kira had just gotten home and put her stuff away when her mom arrived.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
after some talking and dinner Kira went on her nightly routine. thankfully tonight she didn&#39;t have to shift to her beast form like last night. again it probably would have been less expensive to sleep in the nude but she just couldn&#39;t do it. after putting on her nighttime clothes she went to bed. like the previous nights the totem&#39;s eyes glowed once Kira was in a deep enough sleep.  <br />
<br />
This time however the glow was dimmer than before. Kira&#39;s sleeping form however was glowing brighter than before. a barely noticeable crack was now on the totem&#39;s left eye...  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
 waking up she heard her bed creak louder. sighing she assessed the damage. her nails now resembled claws. she guessed soon they would become retractable. her hands had grown and the pads were now fully formed on them.  <br />
<br />
pale yellow fur now completely covered her body. going to the mirror she saw the rest. her face had pushed out more into a muzzle. her teeth looked like small fangs now. sticking out her tongue she now saw it was like sandpaper.  <br />
<br />
her eyelashes were thinner and her eyebrows thicker. her ears now even larger and higher. her hair had grown larger and more wild. a thick beard now encircled her neck. She recognized this as similar to a lion&#39;s mane.  <br />
<br />
barely an inch away was the dirty blond forest on her chest. it was hard to discern whether she still had breasts beneath her now torn crop top. lifting an arm showed an equally dense forest under her arms. the dirty blond fur could now be seen sticking out even when she had her arms down. her hourglass figure was now filled out with muscle giving a somewhat rectangular shape to it.  <br />
<br />
from her current height, she wagered she was 6&#39;4&quot;. the exact height her dad was before he passed. something told her she was not done growing.her bush was now so massive a thick that it covered her belly button. a lion&#39;s tail now above her muscular ass.  <br />
<br />
her jean shorts now ripping apart. her zipper now broken wide open showing her panties and a noticeable bulge. her ankles were now raised higher than her heels raised them. &quot;well at least I&#39;m not a wild lion&quot; he chuckled slightly. his voice now sounded like a man and woman mixed.  <br />
<br />
for some reason he found himself liking this form more today. perhaps it was because it looked more like his favorite animal. it could also be he felt he no longer had to hide being a tomboy in this form. however, the most likely thing he felt was accurate was the changes were affecting him mentally as well. he could easily move his tail like he had always had it.  <br />
<br />
it saddened him when he had to change to his human form. Once Kira was back in her human form she noticed how she was using masculine pronouns while a lion man. She then felt her now ruined clothes fall to the floor. &quot;I&#39;ve got to find a better solution if this keeps up,&quot; she said as she eyed the totem. she then noticed a crack on its left eye.  <br />
<br />
several smaller cracks now littered it. could this thing be giving her its power? just a few days ago she had wanted to get rid of this thing. now however she felt saddened by it breaking. &quot;do not fear... my duty is to guide... I will be your instinct&quot; the voice spoke.  <br />
<br />
now however it sounded like an echo of her lion-man voice. at this point, she decided not to question it. as such she got dressed and headed for school. the figure in the forest smiled and laughed as it saw her go. it was genuinely happy that she had accepted the gift. it then vanished back where it came from.</p>
