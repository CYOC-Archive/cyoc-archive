<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake&#39;s next 24 hours were not as kind to him as his last 24 hours. Katie did not take his last-minute cancellation very well. She decided to go out after he bailed on their plans and &quot;just so happened&quot; to run into a recent ex of hers at a bar. From all the photos and posts, they seemed to hit it off, &quot;just like old times.&quot; She was obviously trying to provoke Jake, but for some reason he seemed more curious than he was jealous or angry. And, if he were completely honest, a small part of him was turned on by the thought of Katie in the arms of a taller, more muscular ex-boyfriend. He probably even had a bigger--<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; he thought, &quot;there&#39;s no way that can be true any more. As soon as I get that watch back from Alison, I can... I can...&quot; It was getting harder and harder for him to remember what that watch could do. He knew he felt bigger when he had it. Or at least more confident, like he was bigger. Maybe that&#39;s all he needed: some confidence. He decided to stop by a book store and get some self-help books on the way to work in the morning.<br />
<br />
The book store was not his best move. The sales clerk who helped him find the self-help section kept looking at him like she knew his little secret. Even her suggestions sounded like she was just teasing him, as she offered one that helped guys who felt &quot;small&quot; in &quot;big&quot; groups or how to &quot;grow&quot; your potential. Worse, she dragged out each suggestion as if she knew he was in a hurry and wanted nothing more than to make him late, which she succeeded at. He left the book store 15 minutes late to work and with a raging boner that he couldn&#39;t explain. Luckily, it was small enough that concealing it was frighteningly easy. Hell, he&#39;d gotten so used to his small size that it seemed even easier to hide it than just yesterday.<br />
<br />
He started his work day with a long scolding two days in a row. While whatever his boss was saying was important, he couldn&#39;t seem to focus on her words. His mind kept drifting to the watch and to Alison. He knew he needed that watch back, but he couldn&#39;t quite remember why. It wasn&#39;t an heirloom, was it? It&#39;s not like his grandpa had a favorite digital watch that he passed down to him. Nobody has heirloom digital watches.<br />
<br />
He also wanted to really prove himself to Alison. Clear up her misunderstanding. He wasn&#39;t two inches. He was so much bigger than that. Practically double. It was weird: he remembered always being concerned about his size, but somehow he only recently realized just how much smaller than average he was. It&#39;s probably why he and Katie hadn&#39;t really done anything yet; he knew she was a size queen, and he couldn&#39;t figure out a way to save their relationship if she found out she was dating a guy with such a small dick. If those videos from last night were any indication, Katie was expecting a lot more from him than he could give...<br />
<br />
Luckily for Jake, it seemed like he wasn&#39;t the only one in the office having trouble focusing today. Most of the guys in the office seemed distracted for one reason or another. Lunch passed by like a hazy dream, and the rest of the work day crawled by. As his mind started to wander back to the videos of Katie, Alison popped her head into his cubicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heya, stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, h-hey, Alison. Listen, I&#39;ve got a lot of wo--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shush, it&#39;s mostly busy work, besides if it were really important you&#39;d have shown up on time this morning. I guess big-dick studs like you can just show up whenever you want though, huh? Strutting around with your two in--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh!&quot; Jake worriedly pulled Alison further into his cubicle, hoping to prevent his neighboring coworkers from hearing whatever embarrassing thing she was going to say. He knew he didn&#39;t want her to tell everyone in the office about his tiny dick, but for some reason the thought of her doing that caused the little guy to stir to life again. Unfortunately for Jake, he pulled her a little too hard, throwing her body into his, and they both crashed into his chair with Alison now sitting in his lap. So much for being low-key. &quot;What? What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Alison said, clearly upset at his tone, &quot;I just wanted to return this to you, but now I think I will keep it.&quot; She dangled the watch in front of his face, and as she did, the little display went from dull grey to suddenly reading out in bright green digits: &quot;8.00&quot;<br />
<br />
The watch! Jake reached out for the watch, and as he did memories of his follies with the settings came back to him. He could fix this! He could fix his tiny cock with that! Somehow... How? If he could just get that watch back, he could remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no, Mr. Grumpy. I think I will hold onto this for a while longer now. Maybe when you prove to me that your little inchworm can grow into an anaconda you can have it back. Besides, I think I am doing you a favor. This watch is probably half the reason you&#39;re late so often: it&#39;s broken!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Broken?!&quot; Jake squeaked out, heartbroken. How did she know what it did? How did it break already? &quot;What did you do to it?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no no, don&#39;t blame this on me: this thing has been broken since you gave it to me. I keep trying to set the proper time on it, but it keeps jumping all around the place after I set it. While I&#39;ve been in the office, it&#39;s displayed 10:32, 19:05, 16:01, 15:33, and a whole bunch of other numbers. I think the closest it&#39;s gotten was about noon. I&#39;ve reprogrammed the time over and over again, but the readouts just keep changing. Sometimes it tries to tell me I have to wait 24 hours to change the time  again! Weird!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Uh! Well, it&#39;s a special user setting. Let me just see it for a--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See! There it is again! I just changed it back to 16: 20 before I walked over here, and now it&#39;s reading 8:00!&quot; Alison craned her head down over the watch and started clicking the &quot;^&quot; arrow. For a brief moment, Jake felt an explainable leap of joy as Alison clicked up and up and up on the watch. He could feel his confidence growing within him, and with his confidence, his--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Alison said, distracted from her mission to readjust the &quot;time&quot; again as she wiggled her firm bubble-butt around on his lap. &quot;Seems like somebody woke up.&quot; As Alison was grinding against Jake&#39;s erection, a small voice screamed out in the back of his mind in horror as he realize that his whole cock could flip up in a little tent in his pants and be swallowed between Alison&#39;s asscheeks without any real effort. In fact, despite the fact that they were just a few pieces of fabric away from actual sex, the only oddity anyone in the office would note was that Alison was sitting on his lap. Jake&#39;s little dick jumped at the idea of him unzipping and having covert sex in front of his whole office and nobody would be able to tell. Then, a cruel voice popped up in his mind and said: &quot;Alison wouldn&#39;t be able to tell, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
The excitement of having almost-sex at work and the thought of Alison riding his tiny cock was enough to send Jake near the edge in less than a minute. Just as he was about to cum, Alison dropped the watch, and as it tumbled out of the cubicle space, it registered a new &quot;time&quot;. A moment later, Mike from the next cubicle over bent down and picked up the watch. He switched his empty coffee mug to his left hand and held out the watch with his right hand. Jake and Alison froze, too scared to move and admit that they were caught. Mike hardly noticed them.<br />
<br />
&quot;22:86? That&#39;s not even a real time.&quot; Mike said. Jake couldn&#39;t explain it, but he suddenly felt shorter than his 5&#39;8&quot; cubicle neighbor, despite towering over him at 6&#39;1&quot;. Mike moved the watch around for a second as if trying from different heights and angles would change the time on the watch. Moments like these were why Jake sometimes believed that his boss only kept Mike around as a fuck toy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there we go. If I hold it like this, it reads 8:00. That&#39;s a little better,&quot; Mike said, pointing the watch more-or-less at Jake. Jake didn&#39;t know why, but he didn&#39;t like Mike telling everyone in the office that his watch read 8:00. Mike clicked away on the dials, and then eventually pressed the &quot;accept&quot; button. <br />
<br />
Just as he hit the button, Jake had a moment of clarity. He remembered what it really was. It wasn&#39;t a watch reading out 8:00. It was a magical cock-adjuster that read out his 8.00cm dicklette. Once upon a time for almost a whole afternoon it was 8 inches, but he had to mess with a good thing and switch everything to metric units.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. I fixed it, sorta. It was a bitch to get right, so I just rounded up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rounded up to what?&quot; Jake asked, half-terrified and half-excited. There was an ounce of hope inside. Maybe he rounded up to 17:00. That&#39;s about 6 and a half inches. It wouldn&#39;t be a monster cock, but that&#39;s bigger than yesterday and big enough to convince Alison that it can definitely grow. Jake&#39;s heart was pounding. Alison, feeling these changes, slowly shifted back on Jake, resting more of her body delicately on his. While comforting, all his attention was focused on Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, It&#39;s basically quitting time, so I moved it up to 5:00pm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake breathed a heavy sigh of relief. 17:00 could really get him somewhere. It wasn&#39;t ideal, and he&#39;d have to wait another 24 hours (which Katie would not enjoy) but he could recover from this. He felt a familiar little tingle and smiled. Jake caught the watch with one hand as Mike tossed it to him as he continued walking to fill up his empty coffee mug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jake said as he placed his hands on Alison&#39;s ass and slowly moved her off him. She turned around to face him, and then leaned in to give him a short, sweet kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, big guy.&quot; The excitement of getting caught seemed to push Alison into overdrive. Jake decided to use this to his advantage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna see how big?&quot; Jake asked as he pulled her down to her knees, eye-level with his zipper. Alison gave him a wicked smile and unbuckled his belt. She bit her lip as she pulled down the zipper slowly. Each set of teeth clicked apart one-by-one second-by-second. Jake could feel his cock straining against the fabric, demanding to be set free. Six-and-a-half was more than double what she saw on him yesterday. After today, he might even be able to convince her that it could double again. Maybe a whole foot was too much. He read somewhere that most women could only...<br />
<br />
Alison reached into Jake&#39;s boxers, fishing for that little dick she felt a few minutes ago. She let out a small gasp of surprise as her hand wrapped around something much different than what she was expecting. <br />
<br />
Jake had his eyes closed, waiting to feel her lips around his average-for-now dick. A moment passed, and all he felt was the cool air blowing over the tip of his dick poking out of her grip.<br />
<br />
Jake opened his eyes, and gasped as he saw before him a penis that wasn&#39;t an average, healthy 17:00 penis, but an early-to rise 5:00 am cocktail weenie.</p>
