<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam was very glad to finally get back to the suite. He had been embarrassed when Angus had taken his hand and given it a kiss as if Sam was a Victorian Lady. The worst thing was that he found his very female body reacting to the man’s attentions. He just hoped that Angus had not noticed that Sam’s nipples had become erect. <br />
<br />
Sam was glad to finally take off the stiletto shoes that Jordan had given him to wear. Walking in them was easy enough but after several hours his feet were starting to hurt. <br />
<br />
He lay down on the bed, looked at the ceiling and pondered the evening. Jordan was right. Angus was fawning over the body Sam currently possessed. Angus seemed a nice guy though, someone that a male Sam would have admired, even if he was a total over achiever.<br />
 <br />
Sam heard the shared toilet flush outside, Jordan was finished and he needed to go. He momentarily forgot what body he was in, lowering his skirt and panties only to find he had nothing to aim with. Reluctantly he turned and sat down. <br />
<br />
As he washed his hands he once more looked at his reflection. Jordan had applied glossy red lipstick to him when they were in the restaurant rest room. It was a much more vibrant colour than she had put on him before dinner. His lips certainly looked very kissable. No wonder Angus was fawning. Sam found himself blowing seductive kisses at his reflection. That reflection was sexy<br />
<br />
Jordan handed him a glass of whiskey when he emerged. “Thought you might need this. You did well. He’s smitten with you. I think this contract is in the bag”<br />
<br />
Sam accepted the glass. “You&#39;re still not forgiven. However I do agree with you. He does seem smitten with me”<br />
<br />
“Sure is. He basically ignored me. To be honest if he wasn’t such a hunk I’d be offended”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the dress. It was really embarrassing what happened to your pants. I hope they can get the stain out”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about the slacks, they will clean up. But it’s a skirt, not a dress you are wearing and it does look good on you. I mean everything looks good on you. I did a great job on that body”<br />
<br />
“Mmmmm. Yep I&#39;m sexy even if I do say so myself. You never did explain how I got to have such big breasts&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was easy actually. I read that on the internet. If you touch the medallion to previously unworn clothing the medallion will adapt your body to fit that clothing. I just touched the medallion to an unworn 32D bra and hey presto!  I made that body tall by touching it to some long legged jeans and slim by using a size 6 dress. You just have to be careful that the clothes your wear haven&#39;t been previously worn&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you have tried a few other bodies with this medallion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it&#39;s rather addictive actually&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever made yourself a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I spent a night as the swimmer you were on our other trip. I never felt comfortable though. I should try it again but this time keep in contact with the medallion as I change. You seemed comfortable tonight. You certainly had no trouble walking in those heels&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess there is something in that. By the end of the evening I wasn’t thinking about been a woman, wearing a dr…skirt and having breasts. This body doesn’t feel foreign to me anymore. I mean it is...... But  I feel comfortable in it somehow”<br />
<br />
“That’s good. See why I suggested we needed to go out. Hopefully you will be comfortable giving your presentation tomorrow”<br />
<br />
“I think I will be. I was actually just thinking about our pitch for tomorrow. I think you are right that Angus is a pushover, but do you know anything about the chief financial officer who is going to be there as well?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know who else would be at the meeting. How about I drag out my laptop and we do a little research”<br />
……<br />
An hour later the two were happy that knew the basics about Cheryl Montgomery, the CFO of Sanguine industries.<br />
She was a 55 year old black woman who was also on the board of the same homeless peoples charity that Angus sat on. She was married but with no children and had started out as the secretary of Angus’s uncle the CEO. The fact that Sam was a tall irresistible blonde wasn’t likely to impress her. They would just have to show this woman how effective and easy to use their management software was and what good value it would be for the business. That was something Jordan would hopefully do in her presentation.<br />
<br />
They called it a night and went to their respective beds, Sam wearing pale blue satin pyjamas that Jordan had packed. <br />
<br />
Once in bed Sam finally had a chance to explore his new body in private and made the most of that opportunity. It was ‘Interesting’ to locate and stimulate ‘his’ clitoris. He quickly learnt that with long fingernails he had to be careful not to scratch. He momentarily wondered if Jordan had a vibrator he could borrow but on second thoughts knew he would be too embarrassed to ask. <br />
<br />
It was disconcerting when his mind started picturing Angus semi naked as he masturbated. That wasn’t enough to make him stop though. It actually made his juices flow and he only stopped after his whole body reacted to his first female orgasm. It was hard to get to sleep after that, particularly as his usual sleeping position was uncomfortable when your chest sported large breasts.</p>
