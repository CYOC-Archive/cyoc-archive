<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Animalia seemingly wasn&#39;t too concerned about the coronavirus, other than locations are who are reliant on tourism, this was because Animalians had more robust immune systems due to the virus. In fact, when a sample of coronavirus was exposed to the Animalia virus, the virus acted as normal white blood cells when they encounter normal viruses. What some thought all of the hype about it was those who generate all kinds of fake stories, seemingly bolstered by semi-realistic facts, just for clicks.<br />
<br />
But there was still plenty going on in Animalia that was keeping it from being boring, mainly from the newest members of the rich and &quot;super-rich&quot; parts of society. While most of the interest was from celebrity newsmongers who were eventually shut out by the PR-MD, there was the occasional one that did get past, but these were under supervision to make sure that the rules the PR-MD put in place were followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;While I can&#39;t tell you anything about Nicole and her mother due to doctor-patient confidentiality,&quot; said Dr. Jones to one reporter, &quot;There is something I can talk about. I took one look at a week in Nicole&#39;s schedule planner when she first converted and I wondered why she hadn&#39;t already buckled from stress. Flute lessons before school; gymnastics after school; museums and horseback riding on the weekend; and then there was homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Another thing that was going on was minor coverage of all the rich and &quot;super-rich&quot; members of society coming to Animalia. What was making news was the fact that said new members were selling all their old manors and belongings. While there were those who were using such evidence for all kinds of fake claims either for or against Animalia, the truth quickly and clearly showed many of their claims false.<br />
<br />
Simon, now &quot;Sim&quot;, after his conversion was now the largest and tallest of the Belgian blue bull Animalians. He was able to showcase why many of the newest members of Animalia were selling their old mansions and belongings by ripping a door off its hinges with seemingly no effort. While there were those who claimed skepticism of the event, there was plenty of evidence to show that it wasn&#39;t a prop door.<br />
<br />
In many cases, the collectibles from said mansions were often sold off to other &quot;collectors&quot;, while some unusual ones were sold to Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not. But in the case of the tackiest ones that nobody in their right mind wanted, these were either burned with fire or destroyed with pea- or bean-sized pieces of plastic explosives intended to destroy such things with a minimum amount of collateral damage, while well within a blasting range. While some were unhappy about this kind of destruction, this was only used on art pieces that were neither important in either art or history and were tacky enough to justify destroying them as &quot;making the world a better place.&quot;.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
One really unusual member of the upper classes was Margaret Cox, or &quot;Maggie&quot;. What made her unusual was the large amount of occultist &quot;collectibles&quot;, many of which were sold to Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not for how unusual they were, not just the fact that she was British. What was also unusual about her was the fact that she was seemingly both a tarot card fortune teller and a spirit medium (or so she claimed). While the &#39;spirit medium&#39; was a little unbelievable, her skill at tarot card reading was undeniable, which got her into Miss Vivian&#39;s &quot;coven&quot;.<br />
<br />
But probably what made her stand out more was the fact that she had gotten a cobra conversion with Polymelia. It was something to see a four-armed cobra, especially one that was extremely skilled in tarot card reading and had a thick, British accent.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Occasionally, there was a case of a viral video starring Animalians hitting more than a million views and more than 100000 likes. One such video was when Tomi and Aida were &quot;moving in&quot; to the Burrows. At first a little upset that there wasn&#39;t an available apartment for them, Tomi was surprised that the primary material of the Burrows was tufa rock. Afterward, after she discovered tufa&#39;s property of being soft and easy to carve, Tomi was able to begin without too much trouble. But what probably made it popular on social media was the fact that, when she began burrowing, she said something similar to &#39;Big girl coming through.&#39;. Not only did that make the video popular, it also made several guys, from their comments, nervous.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Another new thing was the first Science Fiction erotica at the Meat Market starring &quot;Fiona&quot; (her stage name), who was one of the rich girls who joined Animalia recently. While Fiona hadn&#39;t expected to get accepted by Miss Fiona, that didn&#39;t mean that she wasn&#39;t a partial nymphomaniac at times, even before becoming an Animalian. While she was a little unused to this, the fact that the male mouse was a former bodybuilder and porn star who had been at the Meat Market long before she was, and not only that, but he was one that she &quot;enjoyed&quot; watching videos of before bed (not that she admitted that aloud) made her decide to stick this out and fulfil a private fantasy of her own.<br />
<br />
In her first show, she was a mad scientist that had &quot;borrowed&quot; some data on a WWII-era super soldier program, refined and fine-tuned it with modern (science fiction style) technology, and successfully created a clone &quot;super-stud&quot;. She had turned away to take notes on her creation when it broke out of her custom-made growth tank, ripped apart her lab outfit and proceeded to enjoy her. While some parts of it were considered cliché or cheesy, it was considered different enough to keep people coming into the Meat Market.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The jawbreaker for Evelyn&#39;s third punishment wasn&#39;t quite ready yet, so it was decided to do a bit of a prequel to help her warm up a bit more to Animalia. Evelyn was expecting another drop-through-the-floor prank, but instead she was introduced to Iphis, Ianthe, Ty and Lily; as well as Medusa and Medea. They had formed an informal club called the Multiheaded club, and this enabled them to both greet new snakes with polycephaly, as well as help out with the Anaconda family&#39;s children. While they were significantly calmer with Medusa and Medea, they were significantly more curious with Evelyn, which was a little startling for Evelyn at first, because she never had anything to go by for this.</p>
