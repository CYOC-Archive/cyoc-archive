<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What is it you are calling yourself now? 'Queeny the clown with a trumpet up her bottom?'&quot; The King smirked, <br />
&quot;Yes. You are the talk of the town. No, the entire West/Molossia Kingdom! Oh how I would have loved to have <br />
seen you debase yourself so thoroughly. Perhaps when your daughter and her friend, Morgana, and their assorted <br />
lackeys have been put in their place you can give King's Court a private performance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it would be my pleasure to perform at your leisure, my Lord and husband,&quot; Queeny bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it would please you, you despicable trollop. You are not to call yourself my wife, nor Queen of this <br />
realm, again, nor call I your husband. The only men you are worthy of calling husband are the pig farmers and <br />
toilet plumbers. Soon are marriage will be annulled and I can marry a Queen worthy of me. Your new station <br />
will be that of court jester,&quot; The King said spitefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm but a worm.&quot; Said Queeny as she continued to smile and bow low. I could see from the way she furrowed her <br />
brow that, though the prospect of being humiliated in such a way did excite her, she was torn, remorseful that <br />
she had fallen for the King's plan and brought herself, her family and the Kingdom so low.<br />
<br />
The grabbed Ariadne, who was now waiting patiently in front of her master, by the jaw and pulled her face up <br />
to look at him and said, &quot;I suppose I should thank you for what you did to Queen Rachel there. You saved me <br />
the trouble of getting rid of her myself and I never could have found such a wonderful way to take her out of <br />
the picture. Well done, slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ariadne just looked away and meekly said, &quot;Thank you, Lord.&quot; Though whether by choice or compulsion it was <br />
hard to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
Morgana looked on, enraged by the way her daughter was being treated. The telltale glowing of both her hands <br />
was enough to know she was ready to fight but wasn't willing to make the first move. We didn't know who the <br />
Kings elite champions were or what powers they might wield. <br />
<br />
<br />
Before us, in the center of the room stood a tall and lithe warrior clad head to toe in silver armor. They <br />
held a shield that reflected light like a mirror in one hand and a curved blade almost as long as the warrior <br />
was tall.<br />
<br />
To the left of the Silver Knight was an lady elf enchantress. At least they were dressed like a lady in a leaf <br />
green skirt with a thigh high split and matching top that didn't fall low enough to cover her bellybutton. <br />
Still, elves are so androgynous you never can tell whether a fully clothed elf is male or female by looking at <br />
them.<br />
<br />
The third champion, on farthest left, was a very short fellow in a blue hat that obscured their face entirely. <br />
There long blue gown hid the rest of their body from sight aside from one hand that firmly held onto a golden <br />
staff.<br />
<br />
A pure white dressed mage or cleric stood behind the Silver Knight. Above their vest was a crescent moon <br />
hanging from a chain around his neck. He carried no weapon but his muscular arms looked powerful enough break <br />
any of us in two and his stern face said that he would.<br />
<br />
The fifth champion was the strangest. A tiny, red glowing pixie, no bigger than my hand, that held a wand <br />
clearly sized for norma... more commonly sized individuals, I remembered how our gnome friend was quite <br />
sensitive about her size. She flitted around quickly on her buzzing wings around the heads of the Green <br />
Enchantress and Blue midget.<br />
<br />
Lastly, to the right of the Silver warrior there was hulking brute of a man wearing little but a brown loin <br />
cloth and black wide-brimmed, round topped hat. His protruding lower jaw, oddly flattened nose and jagged <br />
teeth hinted at him being a half-orc or at least having a somewhat orc-y heritage. He wore a dozen, crude <br />
necklaces, made from animal parts, bones or teeth, I imagined but on closer inspection one seemed to be made <br />
of pearls and another may have been marble. He carried an expensive looking saber and a simple wooden shield. <br />
He was a walking contradiction.<br />
<br />
The 6 foes stood menacingly before us and, in unison, took a single step towards us (aside from the pixie who <br />
kind of buzzed directly at us a short distance, she wasn't very menacing either come to think of it.)<br />
<br />
Maedel stood firm with her sword in one hand and a recently lost dragon tooth in the other.<br />
<br />
Arn's diaper crinkled as she changed sword stance causing a smirk from the Green Elf. Andrew was a master of <br />
many styles of sword fighting and Arn looked to be about to use some derivative of fencing.<br />
<br />
As our foes took another step closer, I instinctively took a step back. My hands trembled and I wished I had <br />
thought to bring a weapon with me. They raised their feet to take another step and were met by the Gnomes <br />
battlecry as she leapt toward them, &quot;My name ith Dili Dililah Frumpyjump and Oi have come to bwing justice to <br />
King Connor of Molossia and Oi am annoyed no-one asked me moi name!&quot;<br />
<br />
She brought up her buzzing sword and the Half-Orc took it in his broad shoulder. Blood spilt as the gnome, <br />
Dili, was batted away by the wooden shield. Dili swung her shield as she was knocked back, its buzzing jigsaw <br />
teeth cut neatly through the wooden shield leaving the Half Orc with a half shield.<br />
<br />
The white cleric raised his hands and the half orcs bloody wounded began to sew itself shut.<br />
<br />
The Blue mage and Red pixie let rip with thunderous bolts at Maedel and Arn. They dove to the sides and ran <br />
round the edge of the room hoping to take the group from behind or get to the King and finish this. As the y <br />
did the enchantress put her hands together and a protective bubble popped into place around the dais where the <br />
throne, Connie and Ariandne stood.<br />
<br />
The Red Pixie shot across the room after Arn, her wand swinging as she grasped into in both hands beneath her. <br />
She flipped it up to face Arn and a bolt shot from it but was parried by Arn's short sword, bouncing up into <br />
the rafters hitting a crow and turning it into a cat that went straight on to menace the other birds up in the <br />
rafters.<br />
<br />
The Silver Knight came at Morgana, stomping armor clanging on the stone floor and sword at his side ready to <br />
swing. I thought she'd zap him, his armor would fall to the floor and a chicken would emerge from the fallen <br />
helmet but it wasn't to be. Instead she turned to me and launched a swirling pink bolt of magic!</p>
