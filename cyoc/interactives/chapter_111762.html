<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anton carried his new wife into their honeymoon suite bridal style. That was hardly a challenge for him considering his incredibly large muscles, even if his bride was just as muscular. He gently laid Marlysa down on the bed. She was so beautiful in her wedding dress, not that it covered a lot. It basically covered the torso, but it left a lot of skin exposed. Her neckline was so low, her nipples could have slipped out if it went any further. There were also gaps that showed her abs, the sides of her waist, a good portion of her back, and a slit that allowed her tail freedom. It did trail down to her ankles, but being open at the front showed them for anyone to see. Then again, Anton wasn&#39;t much better since he was only wearing shorts, cuffs, and a bow tie. Frankly, they looked more like they were at a swimsuit competition rather than their own wedding.<br />
<br />
But Anton didn&#39;t care. This wedding may have been a lot different from his first one with Joyce, but he was just as happy. It was actually a bit of a relief to not have to wear a tuxedo that would have been too tight despite the tailoring. Anton removed his cuffs and bow tie and said, &quot;Well, we&#39;re finally married. Seems like it took much longer than a few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It helped a lot that so many people were helping out,&quot; said Marlysa as she took off her bridal veil and started pulling off her stockings, &quot;A lot of people wanted to make it a spectacle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It certainly was,&quot; said Anton, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever gonna forget it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m going to make sure you don&#39;t forget tonight,&quot; purred Marlysa as she hugged him from behind, squishing her large breasts against Anton&#39;s broad back.<br />
<br />
Anton reached over his shoulder and clasped Marlysa&#39;s. &quot;Now that we&#39;re married, I don&#39;t have any problem with giving you children. But you are ready for this, right?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; said Marlysa, &quot;I never wanted anything more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if we ruin your figure? What if you won&#39;t be able to compete in the IAC?&quot; asked Anton.<br />
<br />
Marlysa laughed and said, &quot;Anton, I&#39;m a lizard. I don&#39;t carry my young inside me for months. I lay eggs and wait for them to hatch. And even if I have eggs for a few weeks, I can easily get back in shape afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anton was a little bit hesitant about the prospect of procreation. He could have had children with Joyce, but he always worried if he could have been a good father. He and Joyce had wanted to wait a few years, but then they found out that Joyce had a medical problem that kept her from carrying an infant to full term. They could have adopted, but Anton was even more doubtful about his ability to be a father to someone who wasn&#39;t his own blood. Then Joyce died from that hornet sting and Anton thought he&#39;d end up spending his last lonely years with a pet iguana.<br />
<br />
But then the Animalia virus changed Marlysa, transforming her into a woman who had deeper feelings for him that he ever thought was possible. Then she gave him the gift of not only being the same race as her, but giving him a new lease on life. He was back in the bodybuilding game, even if he still coached at the school. But Anton liked teaching. He liked being able to pass on what he knew to the next generation.<br />
<br />
Anton then turned to Marlysa and started kissing her. Lizard lips might not be build to kiss as smoothly as humans&#39;, but they were able to make out for quite some time. Then Marlysa pulled Anton&#39;s hand to her neckline and hooked his fingers around her dress. Anton gave Marlysa a look that silently asked permission and she nodded. He slowly pulled down, exposing his bride&#39;s bare flesh. When he finished, he took one good look at her. She was a perfect Amazon in size, muscles, and curves. Large breasts that had no business being on a reptile stood proudly on her chest, her green nipples fully erect. Her tail was curled slightly around her shapely ass as the end wagged. Anton hadn&#39;t felt this much a desire for a woman since his wedding night with Joyce.<br />
<br />
Then he picked up Marlysa&#39;s hand and pulled it to the hem of his shorts. She didn&#39;t need any more incentive and quickly pulled them down. Being an iguana, his penis didn&#39;t spring out as soon as his underwear was down. Instead, it rose out of his cloaca as soon the shorts were free. It stood out rather prominently, being a bright red and over half a foot long. It was sometimes a little disconcerting for Anton to not see his balls where they ought to be, but his testicles were still there, just internalized. His rather compact configuration actually allowed him to wear tighter shorts than before.<br />
<br />
Anton climbed onto the bed on top of Marlysa. The two of them kissed more and fondled. Anton squeezed her large breasts and tickled her nipples. Marlysa slid a hand up and down his erection while she used her other hand to spread open her vagina. Anton allowed her to guide him down until his head was resting just between her lips. Then with a quick thrust, he plunged the rest of the way in. Marlysa moaned as Anton entered her. This was hardly the first time they&#39;ve had sex, but her heat was making it more intense than before.<br />
<br />
Anton thrust harder into Marlysa, his muscles getting a new workout. Marlysa moaned louder as he pounded into her. She started massaging her breasts that seemed to be burning with warmth. Her moaning suddenly went up a few pitches as she felt a tingling in her nipples. Despite not being a mammal, her mammaries were just as capable of producing milk and now small rivulets were started to flow from them. Anton leaned down and suckled from both of her nipples, making her moan even louder.<br />
<br />
In contrast with Marlysa acting more human in the throes of mating, Anton seemed to be acting more like an iguana. He kept making hissing sounds as his dewlap expanded out. He was momentarily possessed by his iguana instincts to fill the female beneath him up with eggs. He pounded faster than he had before. If his balls were still external, they&#39;d be whacking against Marlysa&#39;s ass in a way that would have been painful. But his internal balls started to swell and clench as they got read to deliver the big load. Finally, Marlysa let out a scream as her vagina contracted. Anton&#39;s internal system took it as their cue and started sending out its payload. Anton&#39;s sperm gushed out of his cock and deep into Marlysa, coating her womb.<br />
<br />
After a minute, the two mated lizards started to recover. Anton&#39;s mind expanded back to thinking more complex thoughts, such as the great affection he felt. He kissed her softly and said, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; whispered Marlysa as she kissed him back.<br />
<br />
Anton&#39;s hand rubbed against Marlysa&#39;s abs. &quot;You think it worked?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only one way to make sure,&quot; said Marlysa coyly before she started rubbing her breasts against Anton&#39;s huge chest. There was not going to be much sleeping in the honeymoon suite tonight.</p>
