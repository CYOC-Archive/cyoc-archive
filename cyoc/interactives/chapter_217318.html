<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Holding the rune in his hand, Duke now activated it, watching as a portal now opened in the Harris&#39;s backyard. Before any of them could enter, they watched as four figures exited, two of which immediately drew Connor and Sparks attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat paused in confusion, watching as her friends now lunged towards a young girl and the blind man. It was only with Dukes help that she was able to keep the pair from attacking. &quot;Connor, Spark, stop,&quot; Nat exclaimed as Spark and Connor looked to attack. She had never seen the pair so angry, the couple letting loose with a string of profanities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go,&quot; Spark yelled. &quot;That psycho bitch has to pay!&quot; Nat raised an eyebrow, glancing towards the quartet of vampires. Confused, she looked between Spark and a teenage girl wearing a Victorian funeral gown complete with pillbox hat and veil. &quot;Who the girl dressed for a funeral?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No the kid,&quot; Spark answered. &quot;She was the one that almost killed Connors dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat balked, her eyes going wide as her vision settled on the 8 year old vampire girl. Vaguely she recalled seeing her and the blind swordsman the first time she had visited the vampire nation. What she didn&#39;t know was that she was responsible for Jacob Morelands injuries. Nat now understood why Connor and Spark seemed so angry. They wanted revenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother if you could please keep your children in check,&quot; Wyatt sighed, only increasing Dpark and Connors vitriol. Duke scowled, still trying to keep Connor from attacking as stared daggers at his brother. &quot;Can you blame them Wyatt,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;After what that little monster Ann did to Jacob Moreland. Why did you bring three members of the Five?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Five,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elite vampire soldiers,&quot; Connor growled. &quot;Ann and the blind guy Ken. They&#39;re the reason my dad is missing an arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s jaw dropped as she gazed at the pair. She recalled Duke telling her how dangerous they were, but she had no idea they were the ones responsible for Kacob Morelands injuries.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve brought them for protection brother,&quot; Wyatt smirked. &quot;After all, considering how we left things the last time I was here I didn&#39;t think we would be welcomed.&quot; Wyatt now glanced over at Spark and Connor, noting the anger in their faces. &quot;Looks like I was right. Didn&#39;t realize Caleb had a little brother and sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Connors girlfriend you dick,&quot; Spark yelled. &quot;And in case you forgot. I&#39;m Caleb&#39;s partner.&quot; Spark now shrank into fairy form,  Wyatt&#39;s eyes going wide in surprise as the tiny green nude flipped him off. &quot;Huh didn&#39;t realize Caleb&#39;s partner was disguising herself as a teenage girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say your peace and leave Wyatt,&quot; Duke exclaimed. &quot;I think you&#39;ve caused enough problems around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Wyatt replied, turning to face Nat and her friends before he continued. &quot;I heard about the rogue hunter and became intrigued. Which is why I asked the remaining members of the Five to accompany me here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The remaining members,&quot; Duke asked. &quot;But I thought Kyra was a member as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was but things have changed,&quot; Wyatt stated. &quot;After giving birth to our children, we realized we couldn&#39;t have the Queen of the Vampires risking her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does Kane fit into this,&quot; Rei asked. Wyatt smirked as he now glanced towards Duke. &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask my brother.&quot; Nat and the others paused, looking to Duke as a sorrowful expression formed. &quot;Duke?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The lsst time I spoke with Wyatt he expressed an interest in Kane,&quot; he sighed. &quot;He wants to turn him. Make him the newest member of the Five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t hold any ill will towards my brother Nat,&quot; Wyatt smirked. &quot;The only reason he agreed to that was to keep you safe.&quot; Nat paled, looking between Duke and Wyatt. &quot;What do you mean safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come now Natalia,&quot; Wyatt grinned. &quot;When I discovered their was another dhamphir did you think I wouldn&#39;t investigate your parentage? I needed to know so that they could be dealt with appropriately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat felt as if she was going to pass out, was the Lord of the vampires trying to take her parents? As the teen swooned, she could see her friends now step beside her, ready to defend Nat with their lives. &quot;You&#39;re not touching Nat or her family,&quot; Rei said sternly.<br />
<br />
Wyatt chuckled, admiring the teens devotion to their friends. &quot;Your friends obviously care about you Nat,&quot; he grinned. &quot;But, you have nothing to fear. I decided to not pry into your family history because of Duke. Apparently my brother is quite protective of you. He seems to view you as a kind of kid sister.&quot; Nat blinked, glancing up at Duke as the dhamphir blushed slightly. &quot;Dhamphirs got to stick together am I right,&quot; he blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;In return for leaving your family alone,&quot; Wyatt continued. &quot;I asked that when Kane be kept alive so that he could be brought before me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Wyatt,&quot; Lancelot stated. Wyatt paused, watching as the vampiric knight now bowed before him. &quot;Lord Wyatt my name is Lancelot,&quot; he said solemnly. &quot;Years ago I served your father Miro before failing him. Before your arrival I asked that we bring Kane before you for trial.&quot; Wyatt raised an eyebrow, carefully studying Lancelot before turning to Ken and Cassandra. &quot;Ken and Cassandra say you are one of the finest warriors they know,&quot; he said. &quot;They also state that my fathers punishment of you may have been, a bit harsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I failed my master,&quot; Lancelot stated. &quot;I deserved Miro&#39;s anger.&quot; Cassandra now stepped forward, the teen lifting her veil before cupping Lancelots chin. The auburn haired girl in her funeral dress now carefully studying the ancient knight. &quot;I am aware of your failures Lancelot,&quot; she stated. &quot;But, after so many years I think you&#39;ve atoned for your mistakes. Besides, it&#39;d be a shame to leave such a handsome vampire in the dungeon. You may not be as handsome as daddy, but you&#39;re close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lancelot,&quot; Wyatt said. &quot;I trust Cassandra completely. If she is willing to vouch for you, then I am willing to have you serve. Please, take your place at my side as the fourth member of the Five.&quot; Lancelots bowed, thanking his new master as he now stood shoulder to shoulder with the other vampires. &quot;Now that just leaves Mr. Kane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt and the other vampires now gazed hungrily at the unconscious body of Ezekiel Kane. &quot;Cassandra, Ken, Ann, would you do the honors?&quot; Cassandra and Ken nodded, their fangs glistening in the moonlight as Ann stomped her foot once. A maniacal look firming of her face as she quickky approached Kane. &quot;Oh and Ann,&quot; Wyatt said quickly. &quot;Leave him in one piece.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat and the others winced as the three elite vampires now sank their teeth into Kanes body. Hungrily the trio began to feed, Nat and her friends stomachs turning as they saw the life quickly drain from Kanes body. In only moments, the trio finished, leaving only the bloodless husk of Ezekiel Kane.<br />
<br />
Nat winced, her stomach churning as she gazed at Kanes dead body. As despicable as he was, she wasn&#39;t sure if he deserved this fate. Before she could say anything though, she gasped as Kane began to twitch. She gasped as Kane opened his eyes, the body slowly moving, its motions Jerry as if he was trying to get used to his body. Unsteadily Kane now stood, his eyes appearing vacant, his body trying to balance as he turned to Wyatt. &quot;Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; Wyatt smiled. &quot;It appears Ezekiel Kane is one of us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a vampire now,&quot; Rei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;His body yes,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;His soul on the other hand sits in hell. What you are looking at is a vampire spirit inhabiting the dead husk of Ezekiel Kane. When word spreads that we have turned a hunter, the influence of the Vampire Nation will increase 10 fold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat and the others said nothing as Wyatt and the others now helped guide the new vampire through the portal. &quot;Wyatt,&quot; Duke called. &quot;Just remember, the wizards and their friends are off limits including them.&quot; Wyatt nodded, looking over Nat and her friends as he now vanished with his newest prize into the portal.<br />
<br />
******************************<br />
<br />
Unseen by Nat and the others, a solitary figure in an SUV had watched what had taken place. Although the spell concealing the fight with Ezekiel Kane had been cast, the woman had ways penetrating that magic. Lowering the enchanted binoculars she had been useing, she now picked up her cellphone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beloved,&quot; she said, pausing as the voice on the other end spoke. &quot;Yes beloved it appears Mr. Kane has failed in his mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman now brushed her auburn haired behind her pointed ears, relaying everything she had witnessed. This group of teenagers was much different than the ones they had dealt with during the war. &quot;Regrettably the Harris children remain unharmed,&quot; she said. &quot;Yes, the next generation of wizards appears to have yet another guardian. What is our next move Fukushu?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Return home Abolith,&quot; Fukushu replied over the phone. &quot;Kane may have ultimately failed yet we have time on our side. Some day will shall have our vengeance against these wizards.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abigail Knight aka Abolith simply nodded, hanging up her phone as she now departed the scene. Their hired assassin may have failed but the pair had gained valuable information.</p>
