<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie sighed, smiling as she gazed around the camp ground, Katie had come through. The college age woman had done what her inter dimensionally displaced mother had asked, bringing not only her friends but Gloria’s as well. What was even more important were the children that had arrived with their parents.<br />
<br />
As Kellie watched the groups intermingle with one another she had carefully watched as the children’s parents carefully took the sleeping children inside the various cabins. Kellie saw Kumi follow her doppelgänger and her husband inside one cabin as they went to put Tommy somewhere comfortable. Lisa too now took a moment to bring a sleeping Lynne inside. Luck appeared to be on Kellies side today as Samantha, Claudia  and Katie followed with a sleeping Morgan, Kari and Tricia in tow.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Kellie Thought. “All I’ll need to do is talk with Kumiko and Cole later so I can place charms on Tommy and his sister.” As Kellie now began to approach the cabin she could see her Mika race towards her. “Hey Kellie Wait up,” she called. Kellie paused, smiling as her friend now caught up with her. “Hey Mika why the rush,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Mika took a deep breath as she now came to a stop. “Sorry,” she breathed. “Just wanted to catch up with you. Are you heading inside?” Kellie nodded as she now stared at the cabin, watching as Lisa, Katie, and Samantha closed the door to the small cabin leaving the sleeping infants alone. “Yeah just wanted to take a peak at my grand daughter,” Kellie smiled. “Oh cool can I come,” Mika asked. Kellie shrugged, beckoning the teen to follow.<br />
<br />
As they entered the cabin Kellie and Mika noticed the three infants sleeping inside a small play pen in a shaded area of the cabin. As Kellie approached she could only smile at the sleeping girls. “Aren’t they adorable,” Kellie sighed. Mika nodded, reaching out a hand tentatively to brush a stray hair from Kari’s eyes. “Yeah they are,” she said. Kellie now took a deep breath as she began to concentrate on the charm of protection she would need to place on the three infants.<br />
<br />
“Kellie Wait,” Mika said quickly. “Before you do anything, there’s a couple of people I want you to meet.” Kellie paused, giving her friend an odd look, before nodding. Mika gave her friend a reassuring smile as she now began to concentrate. Kellie watched as Mika’s features began to change. Slowly but surely Mika’s face began to push out, her mouth slowly forming into a muzzle as jade green fur began to cover her body. Shocked Kellie could see Mika’s body grow, while her teenage curves began to improve, giving the girl a more womanly contour. Finally a fox tail emerged from behind Mika, slowly swishing back and forth. In only a moment Mika has transformed herself from a teenage girl to an anthro Fox.<br />
<br />
“Nice spell Mika,” Kellie said proudly as she gazed at her friend. “Your really starting to get the hang of this.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Kellie,” Mika said warmly. “But there’s a reason for this. I want to introduce you to someone I’ve come to know over the last couple of months. Actually, it’s more like two someone’s.” Kellie paused as Mika motioned towards the other side of the cabin. As Kellie gazed at the area she could see a mist slowly swirl before two adult nine tail Kitsunes appeared.<br />
<br />
“Kitsunes,” Kellie gasped. As she raised her hand to prepare a spell, she felt Mika grasp her hand. “Kellie Wait!”<br />
<br />
“Mika What are you doing,” Kellie exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“Kellie Listen,” Mika said. “These aren’t the Kitsune that attacked you. They’re not even the Kitsune that attacked in the other timeline. Theyre the ones Kumi and I have been meeting on our diplomatic trips.”<br />
<br />
“Well who are they then,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
Mika smiled, bowing to the adult Kitsunes before beckoning Kellie forward. “Kellie I would like to introduce you to Tatsu and Shizen. They’re Karis parents.”<br />
<br />
Kellies jaw dropped as the Golden Kitsune now approached is fire red wife by his side. “Daughter of Merlin,” Tatsu said slowly. “Mika has spoken of you quite admirably. You and your fathers reputation is one of honor.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you sir,” Kellie stammered, still shocked to see two adult Kitsune in the cabin. It was Mika who now spoke, giving Kellie an elbow to the side to knock her from her daze. “Your supposed to bow,” Mika chuckled. Kellie apologized quickly, bowing before the two Kitsune, who in turn gave Kellie a bow of respect.<br />
<br />
“My apologies Tatsu,” Mika said solemnly. “My friends are not as familiar with our customs.”<br />
<br />
“Mika dear it is quite alright,” Shizen said warmly. “Our appearance today is not meant to be a formal one. We have come simply to see our daughter Hikari.”<br />
<br />
Kellie felt herself go pale as she watched the two Kitsune approach the sleeping infants. Were the two Kitsune here to take Kari back? Kellie could tell that unlike the other Kitsune, these two were much stronger than anything she had ever faced. If anything, she would say that their powers seemed almost...<br />
<br />
“Divine,” Mika said softly, snapping Kellie out of her stupor. “You sense their powers? Their power is incredible because quite simply, it’s of divine nature.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Kellie said softly. Taking a deep breath Kellie now angrily gazed at her friend. “Mika What do they want,” she hissed. “Please tell me they’re not here to take Kari.”<br />
<br />
“You need not worry yourself Kellie,” Tatsu said, his voice powerful yet soothing. “We have been watching things transpire in very much the same way that your father has. We are aware of his concerns and we agree with him.”<br />
<br />
“So you haven’t come to take Kari back,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
Tatsu said nothing, a small frown now etching itself across his muzzle. “Unfortunately that will not be possible,” Shizen said sadly as she placed a hand on Tatsu’s massive shoulders. “The magic used by not only Lilith but by our son Fukushu as well have rendered our daughter half mortal. She will not be able to rejoin our clan.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean by half mortal?”<br />
<br />
Shizen now sadly gazed down at the tiny Japanese infant, smiling as she saw two black fox ears and a tail appear on the girl. “Lilith spell returning Hikari’s youth also rejuvenated her mind,” Shizen said. “The woman that was our daughter is no more.”<br />
<br />
“I never should of accepted that demons peace offering,” Tatsu growled.<br />
<br />
“Tatsu my husband,” Shizen said softly. “We are not near to make war. We can Ill afford a battle with Lilith. Besides, Kellie has seen to it that Lilith should prose no more threats to our clans.”<br />
<br />
“I did,” Kellie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Kind of,” Mika giggled. “You see when you aged down Lilith and Circe you kind of rewrote their histories. As long as you exist and are on good terms with the Kitsune she won’t attack them.”<br />
<br />
“Okay um your welcome I think,” Kellie said cautiously, still unsure of how she had helped. “But you said Hikari was half mortal? What else happened?”<br />
<br />
“Our son,” Tatsu said bitterly. “Fukushu. He turned our daughter into this when she tried to protect her adoptive family.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded, remembering how a rogue Kitsune had attacked Claudia and Mika. “Okay so how did that make Kari half mortal?”<br />
<br />
“Fukushu took our daughters immortality,” Shizen said sadly. “Now Hikari shall age like any mortal. She may be a Kitsune however she has the life span of a mortal now.”<br />
<br />
“So have you come to take her home,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“No,” Tatsu said softly. “No, we have seen how the Harris and Tozawa family care for our daughter even though she is not their own. Our daughter will be loved and cared for in their care. We simply wish to visit from time to time.”<br />
<br />
“Kellie,” Mika said. “Tatsu and Shizen have told me they want to have the other Mika and Claudia raise her as their own daughter. They know that she will be well taken care of. All they want in return is to be able to watch her grow. They are going to need your help though.”<br />
<br />
“What do you need me to do?”<br />
<br />
“Kellie,” Shizen said softly. “The other Claudia and Mika have not had the greatest experience when dealing with our kind. My husband and I will need you to introduce us so as not to alarm them.”<br />
<br />
“Tatsu and Shizen have already seen that the other Mika and Claudia are kind of shoot first and ask questions later,” Mika said sheepishly. “We’d rather not start a fight.” Kellie sighed, nodding in agreement. She would help in the introductions of Tatsu and Shizen. She now hoped that this meeting between the parents would go smoothly.</p>
