<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claws thinks for a while, he then says, “you know, the thought about walking like a human does feel interesting”.<br />
<br />
“So… you’d… you’d allow me to transform you into a human,” Jay asks.<br />
<br />
“Not a human, no,” Claws says.<br />
<br />
“An anthro?”<br />
<br />
“Yup”.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “cool, you’ll look so amazing,” he says.<br />
<br />
“We’ll see,” Claws says, “so, how shall this work?”<br />
<br />
“Just climb down from me and just sit on the carpet, I’ll need to scan you,” Jay says.<br />
<br />
Once Claws has climbed down from Jay the 12-year-old scans the reptile and begins typing into his phone, “what exactly are you going to do, and will it hurt?”<br />
<br />
“No, it won’t hurt,” Jay says, “I set the transformation to feel pleasurable. I’ll also alter you… penis… so instead of two you’ll have one, which will have the appearance of a canine’s. I’ve set your human age to be 13, and that you’ll age as a human. Would you like to have a different scale color? Maybe instead of green, I could make your scales a nice blue, and your underscales I’d make white”.<br />
<br />
Claws tilts his head, thinking about it, he then nods his head, “sounds all good to me,” he says, “how long will I be an anthro?”<br />
<br />
“I thought, for now, two days,” Jay says, “and if you like it I could, if you wanted it, make it permanent”.<br />
<br />
“Hm… alright, we’ll see,” Claws says, “two days should be good enough for me to decide”.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “so, you okay with the alterations?”<br />
<br />
“Yup, having only one cock does sound nice,” Claws says, “also I do like the sound of the coloring”.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “glad to hear that,” he says, “oh, and I thought to make you warmblooded and be able to feel emotions like sadness, happiness, joy… you know, like a human”.<br />
<br />
Claws nods, “alright”.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “great, everything is set, you ready?”<br />
<br />
“I guess so,” Claws says.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles and confirms his input.<br />
<br />
Claws shivers when a tingling runs through his body, “what’s that tingling?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s just an indication that the change is about to happen,” Jay says, “at least that’s what the manual said”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, though I don’t feel any different,” Claws replies.<br />
<br />
“I think it takes a while,” Jay says, “we’ll have to wait and see, I don’t even know what the first difference will be, it could be noticeable or subtle”.<br />
<br />
Just as Jay had said this, Claws feels a strange sensation as if something is pulling at his body, his body lengthening and growing, “okay, this feels weird,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay watches in amazement as his pet lizard slowly begins to grow, suddenly a loud cracking and popping noise, followed by a moan from Claws, echoes through the room, “eesh… that sounded painful”.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, but it wasn’t, it kinda felt good,” Claws says, his voice sounding higher than before, causing the lizard to tilt his head, “hu? What’s up with my voice?”<br />
<br />
“Well, 13-year-olds still have pretty high voices, like me,” Jay explains, as he watches Claws back legs and feet take on a more human appearance, as does his front legs and feet, looking more like arms and hands.<br />
<br />
Claws then feels a warmth spread through his body, and as he looks up at Jay, the transforming lizard feels a sudden strong connection to the 12-year-old, “wow, these human emotions,” he says, “they sure are overwhelming,” the tone of his voice, before being cold and emotionless, now sounds much friendlier and warmer.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “I’m sure they do,” he says, “you’ll get used to them”.<br />
<br />
Claws nods, he then begins to moan again as his body continues to morph into a more human-like appearance. The lizard, while his muzzle shrinks and his face taking on a more human child-like appearance, suddenly looks down as he feels his cocks… or rather COCK… emerge from his slit. Claws gasps and looks up at Jay, then he actually grins, “I must say,” he says, “I do LOVE my new cock! It looks so much cooler”.<br />
<br />
Jay blushes, his eyes widen when Claws moves revealing his cock to the 12-year-old, “wh-why are you showing it to me,” Jay asks, his voice a mixture of surprise, shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
Claws tilts his head, “what’s the big deal,” he asks, then grins, “you’ve seen your cock hundreds of times, so seeing a cock shouldn’t make you feel so uncomfortable”.<br />
<br />
“It… it’s…,” Jay tries, but then sighs, “I dunno… it just makes me feel weird, okay?”<br />
<br />
Claws grins, ‘maybe Jay likes what he sees and is just to afraid to say it,’ he thinks to himself, ‘he’s acting like a female would when she’s in heat, which is weird, I mean… he’s a human male, do humans go into heat too? But why would a male enter heat? It doesn’t make any sense, but… the way he is acting surely resembles when females enter heat, I need to investigate this, just to be sure’.<br />
<br />
“The… the transformation should be over by now,” Jay mumbles, unaware of what his pet is thinking, “try… try standing and walking,” he then says, turning his head away, not wanting to see the lizard’s cock any longer.<br />
<br />
‘He sure looks cute when he is so shy,’ Claws thinks to himself, smiling, ‘just like a female looks’. Claws’ scales have by now changed color from green to a nice light blue, his under scales changed from yellow to a bright white color. The former feral lizard slowly gets to his feet, wobbling a little since he’s not used to standing on two legs, “whoa… this sure feels weird,” he says, slowly taking a careful step, then two, then three… soon Claws is walking perfectly on two legs around the room, “not as difficult as I thought,” he says, before stopping in front of Jay’s full length mirror, grinning, his cock still out of its slit, his long tail swishing happily behind him, as he checks himself out, “damn, I really do look cool,” he says, “hehe… cool and kinda scary. But I LOVE it!”<br />
<br />
Jay looks at Claws, “s-so I assume you’re feeling great?”<br />
<br />
Claws grins wider, turning to Jay, “I feel amazing,” he says, “sure, I’ll need some time to get used to this body, but I already like it, finally I am on eye level with you, and it feels so nice not to be stared down upon”.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, still blushing a little, “I… I’m glad,” he says, he then suddenly facepalms himself, “I forgot to activate the reality alteration!”<br />
<br />
Claws tilts his head, “what would that have caused?”<br />
<br />
Jay sighs, “it would have caused everyone, except you and me, to think you have always been an anthro lizard”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, so if I were to go outside as this…,” Claws says, turning back to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jay nods, “people would panic,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, yeah” Claws says, still looking at his reflection, before turning back to Jay, “so… what now?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I could see if I can still alter it,” Jay says, taking out his phone.<br />
<br />
“And,” Claws asks, tilting his head, as he watches Jay look down at his phone.<br />
<br />
Jay looks up at Claws, “I am able to alter the reality,” he says, “but…”.<br />
<br />
“But what,” Claws asks.<br />
<br />
Jay grins, “I’ll alter the reality for everyone, except for you, me and… Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Why not include Jeff,” Claws asks, Jay’s grin only widens, at first Claws feels confused, but then he grins when he understands, “ooooh… this’ll be fun,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay alters the reality, so that only Claws, himself and Jeff know the truth, the 12-year-old then grins at his former pet, “then let’s go and have some fun, Claws”.<br />
<br />
Claws grins, the 13-year-old lizard-boy licks his lips, turning to look at a comic of Jay’s which is a “Spider-Man” comic with the image of “The Lizard” on the cover, “watch out Jeff,” he says, “here comes “The Lizard”!”<br />
<br />
Jay giggles, “hehe, you do kinda resemble “The Lizard” from the comic,” he says, “except you are not green!”<br />
<br />
Claws grins, “I LOVE my new scale coloring, it looks so much cooler,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “I’m happy you like your new appearance,” he says, “now, let’s go and have some fun!”<br />
<br />
The two sneak out of Jay’s room and over to Jeff’s, “ready,” Jay whispers, looking at Claws.<br />
<br />
Claws grins, “ready, Jay,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay opens the door to Jeff’s room and the two enter, spotting Jeff sitting at his laptop with his back turned to them, both grin at each other, before Jay speaks up, “yo, Jeff!”<br />
<br />
“Jay,” Jeff says, turning around, “how many ti… WHAT THE FUCK,” he yells as he spots the lizard-boy standing beside Jay, the creature grinning, showing its pointy teeth. The shock causes Jeff to seemingly forget he is sitting on his chair, and as the teen “jumps” he immediately crashes to the ground with a loud thumb and an “oof”.<br />
<br />
Both Jay and Claws burst into laughter, “I think we got him good, eh, Jay?”<br />
<br />
Jay grins, “yup, we certainly did… Claws!”<br />
<br />
Jeff, still lying on the floor stares at the two, “wait… what… Claws? Your pet lizard?”<br />
<br />
Claws grins, “the very same,” he says, “well… a little altered… but yeah… it’s me!”<br />
<br />
“H-how… wait…,” Jeff turns to Jay, “Jay… you… you haven’t!”<br />
<br />
Jay grins, “sorry bro,” he says, “but I might have copied your amazing program onto my phone, which created an independent app. So, yeah… I actually have!”<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly sits up, still staring at the two, he then shakes his head and chuckles, “well… at least you haven’t decided to use IT on me,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jay rubs the back of his head, “the… idea did pop into my head,” he admits, “but… even if we don’t really get along, I just couldn’t bring it over myself to do something to you. You may be an ass, but you’re still my brother!”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighs, “I know I’ve not been the best big brother in the world, and I’m sorry I treat you so mean,” he says, he then smiles, “maybe… we could bond over the… program and your app? Have some fun, just us three?”<br />
<br />
Jay smiles, “yeah, I’d like that,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff gets to his feet, walking up to the two, he then gives his little brother a hug while staring at Claws, “so unbelievable,” he says, “how are you feeling, Claws?”<br />
<br />
Claws grins, “superb,” he says, chuckling, “I really love my new and improved appearance!”<br />
<br />
“He, I can tell,” Jeff says, “man… you really did get me good!”<br />
<br />
Claws giggles, “hehe, sorry, we just had to,” he says, “by the way, I have to thank you, Jeff! Because of you and your program, which Jay has copied onto his phone, I wouldn’t be what I am, so… thanks!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “my pleasure, I guess,” he says, he then stops hugging Jay, “so, what would you guys want to do?”</p>
