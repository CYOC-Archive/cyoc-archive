<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the short walk between the bus stop and her home, Yui tried her best to push that video and that strange woman to the back of her mind. The young woman tried to remind herself that it was only natural for the thought of her to stick out - it wasn&#39;t every day that she watched some hot woman in a bikini dancing around on her phone screen. By tomorrow, she figured, thoughts of her would surely fade. That odd sensation of warmth she&#39;d felt, and thought to perhaps be arousal, was probably just embarassment at having been watching something so sexual right on the bus, even if her headphones had kept the everyone from hearing the sounds.<br />
<br />
Thus she headed back inside the house she currently called home without much worry that her sexuality had undergone some sudden and dramatic shift. Once she stepped inside, in fact, her thoughts were rather focused on the scents wafting over to the door from the kitchen. Freshly-cooked spaghetti, meatballs, boiled carrots, and steamed broccoli - her roommate&#39;s usual Friday night feast. Yui&#39;s backpack and headphones were quickly tossed aside as she marched through the living and over to where those wonderful aromas originated from.<br />
<br />
She could&#39;ve done a lot worse, as far as roommates went, than the girl currently humming as she served up dinner. Josephine Goldberg - or Joey, as she insisted on being called - had been nothing but supportive to Yui over the past two years, helping her a great deal in adjusting to being out on her own for the first time. It helped that she was a few years older than Yui, and with that, a smidge wiser; that stint in the army she&#39;d gone through right out of high school may have screwed up her back, but it had at least made her a bit less of a thundering idiot, as she liked to say. It had certainly done her body good, as was evident in how fit and lean she was.<br />
<br />
That Yui had spent several moments focusing on that fitness was not something she considered once the older woman looked up and greeted her. &quot;Hey. I think I finally got the cooking time on the noodles juuuust right.&quot; She had to squint slightly to see the plate in front of her, heat from the rising dishes having fogged up her glasses, as one hand came up to brush some dyed-violet hair out of her face. &quot;How was class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too long, but that&#39;s normal,&quot; Yui joked as she grabbed a stool and leaned her elbows on the countertop. &quot;You&#39;re not cooking on the other side of jail bars, so I guess you didn&#39;t punch that receptionist after all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey groaned. &quot;Came damn close, believe you me. You better be grateful I like cooking for you more than I hate the staff at the VA.&quot; With a sigh she pushed a plate loaded with the full delicious meal across the counter to Yui, along with a knife and fork. She quickly started on her own meal without even leaving her current spot - quite frankly, the layer of dust on the dining room table was evidence of how rarely they actually used the thing. &quot;Anything exciting in class?&quot;<br />
<br />
In between bites of meatball, Yui shook her head. &quot;Nope. Boring as ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell is it that your classes can be dull as fuck most days, and then other days you get the shit with the salmon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you please not bring up the salmon when I&#39;m eating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can your life have something happen in it, so I don&#39;t have to keep going back to the salmon.&quot;<br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes, pondering what else she could share, before finally deciding there was no harm in mentioning what had been, at least, the most unusual part of the day. &quot;Well... I got a weird email on the way home.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of Joey&#39;s eyebrows raised very slightly. &quot;Is this gonna be the story of how you gave someone in Russia your credit card information?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yui scoffed. &quot;No, it was just like... this weird ad, or spam thing I guess, and when I opened it, this... this weird video played.&quot; Her free hand reached back to scratch behind her neck. &quot;It had this... this woman... dancing... half-naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Joey was definitely getting intrigued. She looked up, mouth held open for a moment, before shutting it and taking in a deep breath through her nostrils. &quot;And you... watched it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I mean... I don&#39;t know, it was just... kinda... kinda hard to look away from.&quot; She mulled it over while chewing on some carrot. &quot;You just kinda... you don&#39;t expect to see that sort of thing in your inbox, I guess... so I was kinda too in shock to turn it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; She blinked rapidly. &quot;Shocked. Right. No other explanation possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yui sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying your gay, just that, sometimes, a girl your age... you get... curious, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that! Absolutely nothing wrong with that at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the sooner I get curious, the sooner I swear off icky boy penis and embrace the power of the pussy, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the pussy is a very powerful thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a roll of her eyes, she grabbed her plate and slid off the stool. &quot;Thanks for dinner. I&#39;m gonna go eat in my room, where nobody questions my sexuality just because I watched a spam video.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you gotta tell yourself to sleep at night, man,&quot; Joey said with a shrug as she headed off to her own room, dinner in hand. Yui gave her another roll of the eyes as they parted ways; her roommate had been a great friend, but lord love a duck, she could be grating sometimes. Though that was still probably worth it, considering she could actually manage to pay her half of the rent rather reliably. <br />
<br />
Soon she had the door shut behind herself and was able to plop down inside her room, taking a seat at her desk and firing up her laptop. The decorations were still a bit sparse, consisting of little more than some personal knick-knacks and old soccer trophies, but this place had nonetheless become a cozy home over the past couple of years. The desk, especially, had become a place she was intimately familiar with, from late-night internet browsing to cramming for tests.<br />
<br />
Once the laptop was turned on, she quickly fell into her natural rythym, opening up a web browser and checking her email before anything else. As the routine kicked in, her mind nearly went into autopilot, only to be kicked back into focus by the sender listed for the newest email in her inbox. She knew it instantly as the same one that had sent the video from before - and this one had an attachment. Her brow furrowed, as she hovered over the &#39;delete&#39; icon... but hesitated.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d deleted the last email in a hurry, and in that rush, she hadn&#39;t had the chance to actually look into the sender any further. Maybe it would be okay to just... open this one up, just for a quick second. Just so she could check the sender, and make absolutely sure they were blocked. Yeah. That was fine. She took a deep breath, quickly clicking to open the email and rushing to copy the sender address. In her haste, however, her mouse instead landed on the attachment, clicking it twice to open the file.<br />
<br />
As before, a buzzing noise quickly emitted from her laptop&#39;s speakers, followed by distant voices speaking quietly, their words not quite intelligible. Her eyes struggled to work through the harshness of the screen&#39;s light, leaving her unable to focus on much of anything save a single female figure in the middle of the screen. It was, she knew immediately, the same woman who had been dancing in the last video, her bikini replaced by lacy red bra and underwear. <br />
<br />
She was laying on something, rather than dancing, and instead of fast, exciting energy, her movements had a soothing slowness to them. Gently her hand moved across her slender, smooth body, tracing over every inch of her silky skin and impressive curves. The hand Yui had brought up to turn off the laptop had stopped, and slowly retreated, resting firmly against her thigh. Her attention simply couldn&#39;t be drawn away from the woman, especially not once she began to let out quiet, soft moans.<br />
<br />
Even once the video seemed to stop, Yui found herself unable to move much, or focus on much of anything. The first thing she could really think about was her forehead - it was slightly slick with sweat, her arm also proving to be covered in moisture when she brought it up to wipe her forehead. Next was the more alarming fact that she was having trouble breathing, as if her lungs were being constricted - it wasn&#39;t a vise-like grip, but it was still worrying. Quickly she took off her shirt, tossing it aside and stepp over to the mirror next to her dresser.<br />
<br />
In her reflection she could get a hint as to what was troubling her. Her chest... she was absolutely certain that her breasts shouldn&#39;t have been spilling out that much. Confusion reigned as she quickly removed her bra, relief coming instantly once that restriction was gone. That... that couldn&#39;t be right. Maybe she had somehow ended up with one that was too small, or it had shrunk in the wash? But... no, then she would&#39;ve noticed a problem putting it on this morning. Staring in befuddlement, she placed her hands on her hips, and suddenly realized that this part of her too felt a bit constricted.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t really believe it as she slipped off her pants and underwear, leaving her to stare at her nude reflection. She was... well... curvier, for lack of a better word, than she remembered being this morning. It was slight, but it was there, just enough for some difference to be perceived. Yui&#39;s first thought was that she must have simply been mistaken, but... she was certain that those clothes had fit nicely earlier. No, no, she couldn&#39;t have just put on those kinds of pounds in a day, even if she had sort of cheated in another slice of pizza. This had to be psychological, right?<br />
<br />
Right, right, it had to be just a mind thing. To affirm as much to herself, she reached up and grasped one breast - and instantly, found herself moaning at how nice that felt. Suddenly something within Yui reminded her that she hadn&#39;t pleasured herself in quite a while - maybe that was all this was. The staring at the videos, the thinking her chest and hips had enlarged, maybe it was just some pent-up sexual frustration. Maybe a little quiality time her in the privacy of her room could sort all of this strangeness out. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. She bit her lip, squeezing her breast again - god, it felt nice. Surely it wouldn&#39;t hurt to see to herself in any case...</p>
