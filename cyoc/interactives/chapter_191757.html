<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;All right, then.  Let&#39;s see the damage,&quot; responded Jesse in his classic understated way.  Kaylin secretly flipped his erection up under the elastic of his shorts to hide his throbbing boner.  Then, taking a deep breath and tossing the blanket onto the couch behind him, he stood up in front of his friends to reveal the rabbity changes to his lanky teenage frame.  <br />
<br />
There was a lot to look at, yet it wasn&#39;t the sight of Kaylin&#39;s altered body that first struck his two best buds, but rather it was the sour odor of nervous boy sweat intermingled with his strong yet sweet lapine scent that immediately hit their sensitive nostrils.  Sam&#39;s bear nose was full of it and for a moment it made his head swim and his cock stir in its partial sheath; there was just something enticing about the balance between boy and rabbit that reminded him of his own unique bearish musk, and which spoke to how the both of them were poised of the cusp of becoming something far more beastly than human.  Sam glanced over toward Jesse and could see that it was hitting him too.  His eyes were dilated and he was taking deep breaths, almost as if to inhale as much of Kaylin&#39;s scent as he could manage.  Sam also noticed that the lump in the back of Jesse&#39;s jeans was bigger than ever, the seam struggling to hold in whatever was fighting to burst out into the warm basement air.<br />
<br />
Turning back to Kaylin, Sam had to agree that his gamer buddy was definitely well on his way to rabbithood.  His ears had traveled halfway up the sides of his head and were at least twelve inches from pointed tip to base.  There was a soft golden fuzz that covered much of them but their insides were pink and furless and Sam noticed the tiny interior blood vessels outlined in the overhead light.  He remembered back to Bio class that one of the reasons rabbits had such big ears was to help dissipate the heat from their bodies, and Sam figured Kaylin&#39;s new appendages were probably doing exactly that.  <br />
<br />
Getting ever more curious, Sam reached out and ran his fingers up the long fuzzy edge of his friend&#39;s ear.  Kalylin closed his eyes, nose twitching slightly, letting Sam touch his heavily altered body.  As Sam&#39;s fingers rubbed up the edge of Kaylin&#39;s ear all the way up to his sensitive eartip, it started to tingle and he suddenly flinched.  Sam&#39;s eyes widened as he watched Kaylin&#39;s rabbit ears slowly sprout another half an inch.  &quot;Mmmf.  That feels weird.  They&#39;re getting longer up there too, aren&#39;t they?  I can feel it,&quot; Kaylin said looking right at Sam.  &quot;Yeah, they are,&quot; agreed Sam, finally pulling his clawed hand away.  &quot;I guess if I&#39;m going to be a bunny I want the biggest ears I can get, huh?&quot; Kaylin replied with a dry laugh.  <br />
<br />
Looking at Kaylin&#39;s face, it didn&#39;t appear to have changed much.  Sam noticed Kaylin&#39;s nose seemed to be moving a bit -almost twitching- on its own but for the most part everything looked fairly human.  That stopped, however, once Sam&#39;s gaze reached Kaylin&#39;s chest.  Kaylin was wearing shorts paired with an old tank-top.  It seemed obvious that Kaylin had been counting on the blanket to hide the alterations to his physique as the tank top itself didn&#39;t disguise much.<br />
<br />
Like Sam, Kaylin was just hitting puberty and before his transformation didn&#39;t have much body hair to his name.  Things had changed quite a bit, however, as Kaylin was now sporting a puff of creamy white chest fur that spilled over the loose collar of his tank top.  Sam could also see butterscotch colored fur peaking out from underneath Kaylin&#39;s underarms, the virus having accelerated his hair growth in that area almost as if were some form of animal-driven puberty.  Sam figured that Kaylin&#39;s armpit fur would soon blend into the rest of his body once he sprouted the remainder of his rabbit pelt but for the moment, it stood out prominently.  <br />
<br />
Kaylin gave a casual scratch to his bellybutton area, telegraphing to Sam that his friend probably had quite the furry treasure trail down there.  Jesse noticed it too.  &quot;So, you going to take off that tank top and show off your new fuzz or what?&quot;  Kaylin hesitated.  His boner had gone down enough but he wasn&#39;t sure if he was ready to show off his belly fur too.  &quot;Ugh, okay.  I guess I am turning into quite a Chewbacca.  Here goes nothing,&quot; he said, removing the tank top.<br />
<br />
As Jesse and Sam had guessed, Kaylin had indeed sprouted some fine animal fur on his belly.  It started with a few short white hairs just above his belly button but as it neared his beltline the patchy fur bloomed into a silky strip of white down.  Looking at it, Sam was certain that Kaylin must have quite the mess of thick musky pubic fur underneath his shorts.  Heck, maybe his best bud had also grown the strange cocoon of skin and fur around his dick that Sam had recently started to develop.  This was, of course, a question for much later when the two of them were alone.  Kaylin then did a full 180 degree turn to show off his back, which had a thin highway of butterscotch fur starting out near his butt crack and running up his spine until it petered out near toward his neck.  Altogether, it was clear that Kaylin was far from human but the virus still had some work to do before he would be sporting a full rabbit pelt.<br />
<br />
But it was Kaylin&#39;s lower half that was unquestionably the &#39;main attraction&#39; of the teen&#39;s transformed body.  Kaylin ran JV cross country for the boys&#39; high school and so had always had runners&#39; legs.  However, the virus had given the teen incredibly muscular thighs that rivaled those of many body builders and which were straining the hems of his shorts to the breaking point.  Looking at them, Sam realized that Kaylin&#39;s body was becoming that of a prey animal -built for running, hopping, and fleeing.  Also, Kaylin&#39;s legs were hairy -far hairier than any boy&#39;s his age should be.  As Sam&#39;s glance traveled down, he saw that the teen&#39;s leghair thickened even moreso slightly below his knees until it became an unmistakable coat of butterscotch fur.  Kaylin even had tufts of fur on the back of his lower legs which, trailing downward toward his heels, grew in length and gave the backs of his calves a handsome feathering.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Sam was able to take in the full scope of the changes to Kaylin&#39;s feet.  They were huge and animalistic, clearly signalling the direction that the rest of the teen rabbitboy-to-be&#39;s transformation would be taking.  Sam could see Kaylin&#39;s furry stompers were at least twice as long as his friend&#39;s old human feet, and grew much wider as they expanded out toward Kaylin&#39;s toes.  And what toes they were!  Kaylin no longer had five puny pink human toes at the end of each foot but rather three bulbous bunny toes (for a total of six!) each capped by a curved brown claw.  <br />
<br />
It occurred to Sam that Kaylin would need to throw away his prized sneaker collection because his buddy would never be wearing shoes again.  His furry footpaws were just too big.  No matter where he went for the rest of his life his bunnified friend would need to go barepawed, Kaylin&#39;s big furry stompers immediately betraying his species to anyone at a mere glance.  &quot;Whelp, I may have the ears of Jar Jar Binks but nobody in the Lucas universe comes close to having feet like these,&quot; Kaylin said, proudly wiggling his six fuzzy toes and embracing his growing rabbithood.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jesse, it&#39;s your turn buddy.  Is that a banana in the back of your pants or are you just happy to see us?&quot; Kaylin said jokingly, pointing to the squirming lump in the seat of Jesse&#39;s pants.  &quot;How about you show us what you&#39;re turning into?&quot;</p>
