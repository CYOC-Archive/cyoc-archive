<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing the pink color of the liquid in the vial with the image of a woman on it, a wicked grin formed. Pouring the contents of the vial into the beer bottle, Mark discovered that it only filled about half the bottle. Refilling the vial by placing it back in the box, he poured another vial of pink liquid into the beer bottle, filling it. Removing the label, Mark headed back into the living room and handed Greg the bottle.<br />
	<br />
Walking back into the room and handing Greg the bottle, Mark sat down next to him on the couch next to him opening his legs wide so his new cock had plenty of room. Obviously intimidated, Greg moved as far over on the couch as he could and started to drink his ‘beer’. <br />
	<br />
Chugging down his beer Mark ask, “Want another?” Getting up, he grinned seeing Greg quickly chug his own drink and hand Mark the empty bottle. Going over to the case of vials, Mark again poured a vial of the pink liquid in Greg’s beer, but he decided to add some of the blue liquid from the male vial to his beer.<br />
	<br />
Suddenly hearing a high pitched cry come from where Greg was sitting on the couch, Mark turned around to see a very different Greg. Where once had been Mary’s good looking, athletic boyfriend, now Mark saw someone who would be either thought a masculine girl or an effeminate guy. And Greg was becoming more effeminate as Mark watched. Breast began to grow, hips widen and Greg was becoming smaller and daintier.<br />
	<br />
“Dude, what happened to you?” Mark asked feigning ignorance and surprise.<br />
	<br />
“I don’t know!” Greg tried in a high pitched feminine voice. “I was just sitting here when I noticed that everything was looking slightly larger, my clothes were getting larger and was feeling this weight on my chest. I went to scratch myself and found my cock and balls gone and I have two breast and I think a vagina.”<br />
	<br />
“Wow!” Mark replied handing Greg the beer which had the pink liquid mixed in. “How the hell did you turn into a woman? Not that I’m complaining.”<br />
	<br />
“What do you mean?” Greg asked beginning to drink the beer.<br />
	<br />
Taking a swig from his own bottle, Mark said, “Well, your hot dude.” <br />
	<br />
Seeing the blush spread across Greg cheeks not only caused Mark to grin, but also made his cock stiffen. <br />
	<br />
As Greg continued to drink his beer, Mark watched as his breast pushed out, hips widen and hair fall further down her back. Greg’s face softened, acquiring a round shape with delicate features. Pouty lips developed under a nose that was now a button, and this sat between two green eyes with lashes that lengthened under thin eyebrows.<br />
	<br />
What Mark did not see was the changes that his beer was having on him. The robe he was wearing was already having trouble not ripping to shreds, but as he drank, his body slowly grew larger, passing the seven foot mark and widening his already vast shoulders and back. His cock, while not getting thicker, grew longer reaching past the twelve inch mark and his balls, if he had not gotten taller, would have hung passed his knees.<br />
	<br />
A sudden ripping sound caused Greg to look up at Mark and find the robe he had been wearing coming apart at the seams. Watching as the robe rode higher uncovering Marks massive tool, Greg left something stirring in her new nether regions. A hunger started to grow as she felt a dampness start to form and her new breast stiffen. This caused her to start crying, being scared of what was happening to her body.<br />
	<br />
Not paying attention to what was happening to his robe, Mark sat down next to Greg, pulling her into his extensive chest with a paw like hand. Letting her cry against his granite like pectorals, Mark tilted her head up and said, “I need to tell you something.”<br />
	<br />
Before Mark could continue, Greg leaned forward and gently placed her plump lips against his. Pulling away, she said, “Tell me later.” Rapping her arms around his neck, she pulled his face towards her for another deep hungry kiss.<br />
	<br />
Succumbing to his new anatomy, Mark lifted Greg off the couch allowing most of the male clothes she was wearing from the waist down fall to the floor. Only the boxers and t-shirt in which Greg had arrived remained. Carrying her into Mary’s bedroom, Mark let Greg slip out of the shirt while he watched a wet spot form on the boxers.<br />
	<br />
While Mark had been carrying Greg into the bedroom, he had continued to grow and rip apart the robe he wore. By the time Mark had placed Greg on the bed, all that was left of the garment was some cloth around his waist which only covered a very small portion of his genitals. As Greg slipped out of her boxers to reveal her beautifully hairless vagina, Mark undid the sash allowing the last of his covering to fall.<br />
	<br />
Pulling Mark toward the bed with his rock hard cock, Greg began to pleasure Mark and with each passing moment felt his cock growing. Laying down, she invited Mark to climb on top of her. This showed how much each had changed in size for Greg’s female form was dwarfed by Mark’s male one. This only caused Greg to pull him closer. <br />
	<br />
Slowly, Mark started to push his virgin cock into Greg’s maiden vagina. The sudden pain followed by instant pleasure caused Greg to gasp in surprise and wrap her legs around Mark’s narrow waist. Back arching convulsively as Mark’s massive phallus impaled her, pulling out and then pushing further in, Greg and Mark’s only thoughts were of the divine pleasure that was running through their bodies causing their brains to shut down. Pushing deeper and deeper into her hungry pussy as Greg’s calves pulled, Mark took her head in his giant hands and turned her face so he could gaze into her eyes. <br />
	<br />
Strong brow furrowing with concentration, Mark lined his manhood up to unload his rampaging sperm into her waiting womb. Unable to stop themselves because of the primeval urges that now controlled them, Mark and Greg climaxed together each time more intensely than the time before.<br />
	<br />
In her abdominal region, Greg felt a small popping sensation, like a tiny explosion had occurred near her stomach. Clitoris flaming, Greg’s world exploded as a deluge of endorphins and hormones filled her body and Mark’s giant cock spread her cervix.<br />
	<br />
Rapping her arms around his neck, Greg pulled Mark towards her for a kiss which allowed them to explore each others mouths. The hunger she felt in his kiss was equivalent to a hunter’s, and suddenly she sensed the first convulsing of Mark’s climaxing phallus. World erupting, her cervix swallowed the head of Mark’s penis, tightly securing the head to make sure the seed stayed inside her womb.<br />
	<br />
As waves of orgasms swept through their bodies, the two’s awareness only included the heavenly point where Greg’s womanhood and Mark’s manhood became one. Greg was unable to keep track of the number of times that her cervix convulsed, and Mark did not even try count the number of times his new testicles prepared the launching portion of his cock and burst forth white hot semen to coat the interior of the waiting womb.<br />
	<br />
Mere seconds passed before Mark’s storming sperm found the anticipating eggs that had been released by Greg’s new ovaries. Even before the two could slow down, the eggs bloomed with new life. Rolling around on the bed, Greg’s legs never unlocked their grip from around Mark’s waist, and as the two came to a stop, her body still would not release her coming children’s father. <br />
	<br />
Laying on top of Mark, Greg continued to enjoy the ripples of pleasure which flowed through her body. Both completely spent, the two fell asleep, Greg with her legs still lock around Mark while lying on his chest, and Mark’s penis still buried deep in her pussy with his massive arms holding her small soft body against his giant hard one.</p>
