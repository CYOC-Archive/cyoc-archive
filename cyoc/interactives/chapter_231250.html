<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle had rolled the thought over in his mind, Jen had said that if he touched multiple people he would copy all of their legs, not just the first he touched, he decided that since the next day he would get a fresh set, he would try something strange. His three friends were Jarred, a tall lanky, goth kid, Alex, a slightly shorter skateboarder, and Tim, who was about Kyle&#39;s height. Since he didn&#39;t want to end up with their legs at the end, he wanted to try and get all three at once. While weird, it would be temporary after all, he had a nagging thought though, what if the way she worded the curse also forced him to keep what he had? Kyle shuddered at the thought of the freak he could become, hoping it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br />
<br />
They met in the park, a new statue, one that was a copy of the Venus de Milo, save for it was twelve feet tall, sat in it&#39;s new home in the center of the fountain they were meeting at. Kyle felt a pang of desire to go over an touch it, but he resisted, he was here to get his friends out of the way, if he wanted he could come back later for her. The came in at roughly the same time, and talked for a while, Kyle kept his distance for his plan. They had a ritual, not unlike the football players did, putting their hands together as they stood in a circle then breaking. Kyle planned for his to be the first hand in the circle, hoping that would work. <br />
<br />
He was getting antsy, the heels he was stuck with bothered him, but then they got in their positions, he managed to be the first and much to his delight his plan worked, first he felt his motherly legs shrink, and his feet go flat in a copy of Tim&#39;s shoes, then nothing happened for a moment. &quot;Shit, this is going to be harder than I thought, now I&#39;m going to have to...&quot; Kyle was cut off mid thought by feeling the alien feeling of a pair of hips and legs bump behind the pair he already had, Jarred&#39;s boots making a clunk as the landed behind him, and he visibly saw Alex legs grow out from his torso, naked at first not that anyone saw, he got a quick glance at what Alex was packing as the pants he had on were cloned onto his new forward legs, and the tennis shoes clad his new feet. Kyle could hardly contain himself, his plan worked, and he had just taken down three people off of his do not want list. <br />
<br />
They spent the rest of the day hanging around the park until it got a little darker, the weird feeling of having six feet was throwing Kyle off, but he put on a good act, fortunately for him they had come in facing the same direction, sprouting from his waist. He was surely a strange sight, not that anyone noticed. Finally he and his friends said goodbye and he made his way home, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking of what to do with all three of these legs when he got home. <br />
<br />
Kyle made it home and found that his mom had gone out for the evening and that he would have the house to himself, it was Sunday, but a holiday tomorrow so he wouldn&#39;t have school, and Kyle walked back to his room, closed his door and stripped all three of his legs. He had been horny from the second he got them, much more than usual, but having three cocks did give it more edge. He lay on the bed, barely wasting a second he grabbed the copy of Jarred&#39;s cock and aimed it into Tim&#39;s ass, he wasn&#39;t hesitant about doing the same with Alex ass as well, and he started grinding. Kyle should have felt guilty, or at least a little dirty, but all he could think of was fucking himself, he grabbed Alex cock and stopped. <br />
<br />
&quot;DAMN! Alex is huge.&quot; He looked down and saw in his hands a mighty eight inch cock, this sent him over the edge and he started really pounding himself and stroking his new cock. After an hour of cumming repeatedly he finally had enough an lay there panting. &quot;If I end up with a girl&#39;s legs, I&#39;ll have to remember to try and fuck Alex.&quot; He thought, not being the slightest bit shaken by this thought, he got up, washed himself and spent the rest of the night playing games. Tomorrow he would go for his final target, Miss Menedaz, his overweight neighbor who love giving him cheek kisses, he definately didn&#39;t want to, but it was now or maybe forever if he didn&#39;t.</p>
