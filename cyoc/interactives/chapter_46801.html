<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon looks at the transformed rick and calls out tentatively &quot;dad&quot; the wolf stops and finally looks Brandon right in the eye Brandon lets out a breath he had no idea he held as he met his dad’s lupine eyes that clearly showed recognition of his son. rick then began to cough slightly then Brandon heard a harsh croaking voice that trembled and sounded uncertain as if the through from which uttered it had not spoken in a long time &quot;b Brandon we need to talk would you like to sit so we can&quot; his dad said and gestured to the couch Brandon was nervous to say the least but sat next to his dad. &quot;dad what happened to you?&quot; he asked his dad let out a deep sigh i guess i should have told you but I am a lycan or a werewolf if you prefer and what you are seeing is my transformed state is it clear so far” Brandon “I think so but why have I never seen you transform before” Dad “well long ago a lycan discovered a potion that turns the wolf gene off and since you know what I am and since it is time I guess I should tell you am not your step father but you biological farther” Brandon just stared as if he was a lunatic “How” dad “well your mother and I met just before you were born and ever since we have had a on again off again relationship but when you where little she decided that I should be a part of your life ”Douse she know you’re a werewolf yes I told her just before she left” bran “she is not coming back is she” dad “no Brandon she is not coming back to live with us but she has not abounded you” bran “ that’s a relive hey wait a minute if you’re a were wolf douse that mean I am one to or do I have to be bitten” dad laughing “ that biting thing is not true unless it is a mating bite and yes you will become one and if memory serves your first transformation will be tonight” “oh and I just forgot one thing that I think you should know all werewolf’s are male and how to say this gay” Brandon just shocked says “then how was it you liked mom” dad “you know the potion that turns the gene off well the it also for most turns us straight” “and I think I should also mention we are also practically immune to all sickness and silver has no effect on us anything else you want to know” bran a tad bit embarrassed “uuhhmm would there be any taboos I should worry about” dad “ well no not really just about anything is acceptable except for rape we do not tolerate rapist’ his voice became slightly heated at that “other than that well cant go and cause any permanent injury to your partner other than that your permitted to do just about anything no human taboos here” bran “thanks dad that helped a lot but can I ask do we form packs you know with betas and alphas and the rest” dad “ well that all depend on the individuals involved but generally we just prefer one partner for life and funny you should mention alphas and betas they do have a little to do with us” ban “and that would be” dad “I’m getting to it well those terms tend to apply more to sex than anything with alphas being the tops while betas are the bottoms it’s also general you spot in the relationship when with our own kind” bran “is this a inherited trait” dad “no depend on the individual themselves not on the parents” bran “dad so which one are you” dad looking down and tracing his paw on his leg “well son to tell you the truth I happen to be a beta” Brandon just stares at him then laughs but suddenly he doubles over in pain “awww’ dad worried goes to his sons side “son are you alright” bran just groans in pain as it grows rich begins looking for something to help his son when he spots the clock it reads 12am midnight rick then sighs in relive he picks his son up in his strong furry arms and takes him over to a wall were he just holds his son “shhh its al right its just your first morph” bran “it hurts dad I feel like I’m dying” rick “ I know the first always hurts just relax and let it happen” bran “I’ll try he whispers” rick “I am going to rip your clothes off it will be easier that way” Brandon only nodes rick then proceeds to rip of all his clothing a throw them in a pile a ways a way Brandon presses his naked human flesh to his father’s hairy hide rick just coon’s to his son as he watches his transformation his muscles just balloon under ricks arms as his son grows big and muscular like a body builder  he hears the snap and crack of bones as they grow and rearrange his moth begins to lengthen in to a mussel his nail lengthen and sharpen to claws as he gains more paw like hands then his fur begins to grow and cover him like a blanket he watches wolfen ears top his sons head he then hears a whimper from his son as he feels something press into his sheath he looks down realizing its his tail he moves to give it some room after this was done Brandon just slumped against his dad and dozed lightly  rick knowing how hard the first is just let him an hour or two later Brandon began to stir rick asked “are you ok” when his son was fully awake bran “yeah I feel so much better think we can stand” rick just nodded when they were both standing it turned out Brandon was even tall er than his 7’3 dad standing about 7’8 and was far more muscular  rick looked over his sons Adonis like body until his eyes rested on his sheath and his eyebrows raised in surprise for it was huge easily bigger than his own large sheath and softball sized orbs seem perfectly suited to his body then rick felt something rather rare for him he felt his inner beast stir and say somewhat submissively in his head “alpha” true he was a beta but there were few alphas that caused his beast to stir let alone say that one lone word meanwhile Brandon was looking his own dads fairly muscular body on his own and found it quite attractive with his recent transformation he lost most of his inhibitions so said “so dad do I happen to be a beta or an alpha?” this startled rick out of his lustful daze and responded “you are undoubtedly an alpha for any betas inner beast will say so” Brandon took note of the inner beast comment but had other things on his mind ‘dad I have to say this I find myself greatly attracted to you” rick simply stated “as do I” Brandon walked up to his dad and embraced him and asked ‘will you be my beta” rick with love and lust in his eyes replied “Yesss” Brandon then asked “what do you want to do dad” his dad paused for a moment because he had not had sex with another of his kind since before Brandon had been born or another human male then said with heat evident in his voice      <br />
