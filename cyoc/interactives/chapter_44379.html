<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He rubbed his eyes &quot;Dozed off, still here?&quot; He stood up, untucking his uniform. The building itself was kept cool so him wearing his uniform wasn’t hot, but it was uncomfortable. He began to unbutton his shirt, he wore a white thin t-shirt underneath it all. Thin enough you could see the peach colored skin and a bit more beneath it. He was sweating a bit. He hung his jacket and hat on the coat hanger and messed his cropped hair so it didn’t look like he had hat hair. I had turned my head to watch he. I couldn't help but admire what all the work he had done in the gym. He was a big, muscular-looking guy. I had vague thoughts about what he might look beneath those uniform pants. Airing out his chest and pits as he paced a bit, bored himself, &quot;Ahh, I stink&quot; he tried to be or at least sound friendly. He seemed to know I was watching. He wasn’t sure of what I was thinking, though, but he did like feeling my eyes on him. He had mental images of him pinning me to the wall or me and him in a fighting situation where he would be all big and tough and, of course, win. Even though he had seemed rough when he was pushing me in and out of the car, I got the feeling that it was mostly an act.<br />
<br />
	He scratched his belly button, leaning against the wall, &quot;So how old are you?&quot; He was always curious about the age of the criminal. Were they just a kid or a hardened criminal... in my case I wasn’t even a criminal, really. He could probably let me walk today, have me on house arrest, but it was usually required to mess with the guy first by keeping them in lock up. &quot;Twenty-one.&quot; I said, though I looked to be eighteen. I wasn't lying though. I said, my eyes on the hand playing with his belly button. &quot;Ah,&quot; my eyes widened when Drew’s hand slid down the front of his pants and adjusted himself right there, right in front of me! Just like that...  I thought 'he has to know that I‘m watching,' &quot;So why drugs?&quot;  he asked. I looked away, afraid of being caught. &quot;I needed money.&quot; I said, sounding stiffer with a new kind of fear. &quot;Mm... you know you could just get a job..&quot; He grinned still fondling his sac, obviously he didn’t know what he was doing, in his mind this was normal. He was always able to let loose a bit this late at work. I saw it, though, in the corner of my eye, as I tried not to look. &quot;Heh, yeah... around here?&quot; I shook my head, knowing that there were few jobs available and even fewer people that would hire someone from my neighborhood. &quot;So move.&quot; Though he didn’t know my situation, he already knew the basics about me. If he really wanted to, he could have found out my age, even my birthday sooner, without asking. He took his hand out of his pants, leaving a bit of a bulge. He wondered if he should go to the gym and work it off. He knew he shouldn’t have touched himself as he would usually get a stiffy. I looked over at him, wondering if he knew how difficult it was to move when you had almost no money and couldn't leave your only home. Of course, looking at Drew, I saw his very large bulge, much larger than I remembered, so I knew he was hard.<br />
<br />
	&quot;So ... what kind of drugs..&quot; He walked into the storage room coming back with the bag of 'treats.' When he returned from the side, it was even more obvious that he was hard. <br />
<br />
	&quot;I... don't know. I just grabbed anything I could and ran.&quot; I said, not saying anything about the fight and escape from Darnell.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Uh huh... so technically you’re just guilty of stealing his drugs&quot; He laughed at the irony holding the bag. &quot;Doesn’t look like any type of drugs I recognize…&quot;<br />
<br />
	I shrug, &quot;Yeah... I guess... I just figured I could sell 'em, I didn't care what they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ever try drugs?&quot; He grinned holding the bag to his side. <br />
<br />
	I shake my head, &quot;No, never.&quot; I say honestly. I had managed to keep myself clean in a dirty area, a feat in itself.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Good, good for you. I’ve dabbled in supplement steroids in high school. Nothing serious, I suppose.&quot; I confessed. &quot;You’re looking at my crotch a lot.&quot; Drew blurted out. <br />
<br />
	 I blinked and looked away. &quot;Well... it's bigger than the rest of you.&quot; I say, trying to tease him.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ya think?&quot; He grinned, he liked this, where it was going... He stepped closer, to my surprise, about a foot from the bars. &quot;Bigger than yours even?&quot; He chuckled scratching his chest. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Huh?&quot; I look over at him in surprise. I didn't know what was going on with him, but something told me that Drew wouldn't try to hurt me or anything.<br />
	<br />
	&quot;Come here and grab it... Tell me if it’s bigger,&quot; He said in a firm tone. He was sweating quite a bit, nervous as hell. He could get in serious trouble for even talking like this to an inmate.<br />
<br />
 	I stood up nervously, not sure what was going on. We were alone, though... so I slowly walked over in front of him, looking at his face a bit before staring at the thick bulge. Drew stepped closer as his bulge pushed through the bars. His pants’ fabric was light enough I could see a decent outline of my shaft. &quot;Feel it.&quot; He wanted me to touch him, he was having such a rush by just asking. However, he felt like his heart would explode at any minute. He kept picturing Dave walking through the door. Though the cells didn’t have a clear view of the entrance, he was still scared. But remained firm and dominant. I nodded slowly and stepped even closer to the bars, putting my palm against his shaft which was pointing straight up. My fingers down, I began to slowly stroke it as if something came over me. Rubbing it with my palm, I look up at Drew. &quot;You're... really long...&quot; &quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; He grinned at me as I groped him through the bars. He felt a great deal of power but at the same time he felt like he was going to pass out. He reached behind him. To my surprise, he grabbed the bag of the ‘treats;’ pulling out a blue pill. Which he thought had to be a Vike (Relax/Mellow Pill). Even though it was unlabeled, he still popped it in his mouth and dropped the bag on the floor while he summoned up enough saliva to swallow. I kept rubbing, wondering what would happen when Drew’s partner came in later and saw the cum stain on his uniform pants.<br />
<br />
	He moaned, &quot;Oh yeah that’s the stuff!&quot; He grinned putting his arm through the bar pulling me closer with his large hand on the center of my back. Within minutes, he felt something, he felt... good... The shock and surprise made me move my hand, but then I realized I was just as hard when I felt my cock against his through our pants. He moaned as our lips met through the bars. I were dumbfounded. &quot;You do this and keep quiet about it, kid, and you won’t have a record. Nothing is final right yet.&quot; He promised, honestly he hadn’t even submitted the files, saying I did anything at all. And he would let me go with ease and tell the department he had handled it. They, of course, would believe him easily. I nodded, but as I leaned forward through the bars this time, I moaned quietly as we kissed.</p>
