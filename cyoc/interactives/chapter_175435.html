<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kristen smiled watching her new girlfriend start to dribble cum out of her cocktongue as her eyes seemed to roll back into her head from the pleasure. However her cocktongue didn&#39;t change shape or twitch even an inch, the thing just stayed flacid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, looks like I totes forgot to make you get hard Jenny. I so like totes have the perfect way to like, fix this. Come here for a sec&quot; said Kristen pulling Jen&#39;s head over to her mouth. From there she worked her mouth around Jen&#39;s cocktongue allowing for the semen to flow directly into her stomach as the girls began to make out again. <br />
<br />
Slowly, Jen was growing more and more aroused, and in part, her cocktongue was getting longer and harder until it pushed Kristen away from her, much to her own disappointment. She knew exactly how she could fix this though. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tramphhorm or &#39;are&quot; she mumbled through her cocktongue. She then held up her hands into a &quot;T&quot; shape to signal which to choose. Kristen understood and replied &quot;tramphorm&quot; while still sucking on Jen&#39;s cocktongue, however she didn&#39;t want to inconvenience the curse, so she slipped off of it and said &quot;Jen calm&quot;, causing jen to stop her slow orgasm and for her cock to retract back to its flacid state. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I want you to transform where you&#39;re able to fit my entire cocktongue into your mouth and down your throat safely. Where while you are sucking on my cocktongue, you do not need to breath. And will be perfectly fine with any amount of my cum you consume no matter what.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kristen felt her throat muscles completely relax as her esophagus was now able to be widened to an extreme amount. With her still braindead looking stare, she returned the curse back to Jen, but made sure that she took both. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, your cocktongue is like, amazing. So much so that I think you would be like so totes hotter if like, your arms were giant cocks too. Except you could like, move them around and like do normal arm and hand things with them. Oh, and like, I really want your cocktongue to like, be horsecock shaped. That would be like, so awesome to suck on. Ooh, I just thought of something like completely amazing. I want you to like, grow a 2 foot long cock for a tail, and have it function mostly like a dog&#39;s tail. But starts oozing cum when you are like, extremely happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare, you like, have to curse me again, and make me like, able to speak normally if I want to. Like, this is totes hot and all, but it is like, a total chore to say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen felt her ass cheeks spread a part a bit near the small of her back as a 2 foot long, 3 inches in diameter cock pushed itself out of her spine. It turned completely errect, which made it curl upwards a bit amd began oozing cum while wagging back amd forth, flinging her cum all over the stall. Her hands balled up into fists as they turned into the glands of her new cockarms. Lastly her cocktongue&#39;s gland pushed forward and flattened out a bit, as the entire thing became a horsecock in shape. <br />
<br />
She was now beside herself as to what to do now. Everything felt just so good to touch now. Just rubbing her cockarms together sent massive shivers throughout her entire body. She hugged Kristen, which also felt amazing as she slid her cockarms into her armpits as she squeezed her arms down her sides, and began fucking them as she reintroduced her cocktongue into Kristen&#39;s mouth. Jen&#39;s cocktail was wagging so hard it was a total blur as her cum was being splattered everywhere. <br />
<br />
Before Jen could really slip her cocktongue down Kristen&#39;s throat, she managed to push it out and give her a command. &quot;Jenny, sit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen released Kristen and squatted down, just like a dog would. Except her cockarms were foulded down to her sides making her appear as if she was begging like a dog, instead of sitting like one, with precum slowly trickling out of her cockarms too. <br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t know if she was panting simply because she wanted to or because the curse was making her act more dog like. Honestly she didn&#39;t care. She was being a good girl and waiting for Kristen to praise her. In reality, she was simply getting carried away in her own fantasies. Nothing was forcing her to behave like this except for her own pevertedness. <br />
<br />
Kristen had said that Jen was hers now, but that wasn&#39;t part of the curse and was simply a figure of speech. Kristen just meant that they were now an official couple. That they were now girlfriends in a rather extremely unorthodox, lesbian relationship. But hey, if Jen misinterpreted that as she was now her pet, then Kristen wasn&#39;t going to correct her, at least for now that is. She rached down and began to pet Jen on her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl. Come on now, lets get back to class.&quot; Kristen didn&#39;t bother putting her shoes back on and began walking out of the bathroom on her tiptoes as if it was completely normal for her to do so. She neither felt pain or discomfort in doing so and to her surprise, was able to keep her balance, even when she stopped moving and bent down to pick up their scattered clothes, putting her own on, and placing Jen&#39;s inside her bag. She didn&#39;t know exactly when Jen had stripped, but that didn&#39;t matter anymore. No one would think it strange of her to be naked anyways. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, follow.&quot; She commanded, and Jen did just that. She stood up and walked out of the bathroom behind her, completely naked from head to toe like the good obedient pet she thought she was supposed to be.</p>
