<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, Eve?” the priest asked politely.<br />
<br />
“I... I do, of course,” answered Eve with a smile. <br />
<br />
It was her experiences as an amateur actress in all those old high school theatrical productions she'd been <br />
involved in as a teen that saved her at this critical juncture. The show must go on! Despite the sudden flood <br />
of new memories and the firm knowledge that she was someone else – the best man, actually! – Eve was still <br />
able to maintain her composure and perfectly play the role of the blushing young bride.<br />
<br />
Indeed, Eve still was the blushing young bride. She still retained her own identity and all her memories of <br />
growing up as a little girl, then meeting Paul and falling in love, and winding up here at the altar on this <br />
special day. She just knew now, in addition to everything else, that she was really Timothy Sherman... and <br />
that twenty-four years ago, Paul's stupid magic spell had really worked, giving Tim this whole new life. Eve <br />
remembered becoming trapped in that old woman's life and then... dying! She had actually died and... and... <br />
had she gone to heaven? Then she must have somehow been reborn as Eve Jones. The recollection of having <br />
actually died was particularly painful. She couldn't bring herself to dwell on that, but she knew it had <br />
really taken place. But the bit about the afterlife – had that really happened? That part seemed fuzzy and <br />
almost dreamlike. <br />
<br />
Still, she had memories of concrete certainty of having been Timothy Sherman for fifteen years. Then somehow <br />
she died, and became reincarnated as Eve Jones for the next twenty-four years. <br />
<br />
But if Tim had been reincarnated as her... then who was the best man standing on the other side of Paul?<br />
<br />
The rest of the ceremony went off flawlessly. Only the most meticulously penetrating observant would have <br />
caught the occasional odd glances from the bride towards the best man. Eve knew that had been her body for <br />
fifteen years. It was so much older now. And who was inside it? It had to be the old woman whose life Eve had <br />
been living when she died. But she was a 'he' then... although a he living the life of a she... it was all so <br />
confusing, but Eve knew it had really happened. <br />
<br />
However, Eve also knew she was now Eve Jones. And this was her wedding day! So, a bit reluctantly, Eve decided <br />
to file away this sudden epiphany for rational analysis at a later date. She simply went back to being Eve <br />
Jones and enjoyed her wedding ceremony, the reception and dinner that followed, and the dance which followed <br />
that late into the night. <br />
<br />
It was just an hour or so before dawn by the time Eve and Paul bid farewell to their wedding guests and <br />
retired to their hotel suite. The happy couple, exhausted by the day's events (and more than a little <br />
inebriated from the copious amounts of champagne they'd consumed), made the mutual decision to consummate <br />
their marriage later, after some much needed sleep.<br />
<br />
Paul simply stripped to his underwear, collapsed heavily on the bed, and almost instantly began snoring. <br />
<br />
Eve however carefully removed her wedding attire and then stood naked in front of the bathroom room for a good <br />
long while. She was a beautiful young woman. Not just physically, but deep down inside. Yes, she had been a <br />
boy named Tim for fifteen years. But she had been Eve for that plus nine years. There was more “Eve” in her <br />
now than “Tim.” <br />
<br />
Her mind raced back to a Philosophy of Feminism class she'd taken in college. A quote from Simone de Beauvoir.<br />
<br />
“One is not born a woman, but becomes one,” Eve whispered softly to her reflection in the mirror. <br />
<br />
But there was still the matter of Truth. Eve had once been Tim – Paul's best friend. Surely Paul had the right <br />
to know that. And then there was the matter of the current Tim. Evidently, some poor old woman had been ripped <br />
away from her life and magically brainwashed into becoming Tim Sherman. That seemed all wrong. Whoever or <br />
whatever the new “Tim” was, didn't he/she have the right to know the truth about all this? And perhaps, even <br />
after all these years, Paul still had the spellbook – the means to... to do what? Eve didn't particularly want <br />
to give up her happy life and become either version of Tim... the current middle-aged one or the adolescent <br />
version she remembered being. But things were still all mixed up. Something needed to be corrected, even if <br />
Eve couldn't put her finger on exactly what it was. <br />
<br />
What else was it Simone de Beauvoir had said?<br />
<br />
“I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for Truth,” said Eve. “and Truth <br />
rewarded me.”<br />
<br />
Paul had to know the truth. And then together, the two of them would tell “Tim” the truth.<br />
<br />
Quite probably, Paul no longer had the spellbook after all these years. Certainly, Eve had never caught a <br />
glimpse of it amongst Paul's many, cluttered belongings. So likely, it was a moot point whether or not <br />
anything could be “done” about their situation. But Eve's rock-solid moral compass demanded she share the <br />
truth with Paul first thing in the morning.<br />
<br />
How does Paul react the next day?</p>
