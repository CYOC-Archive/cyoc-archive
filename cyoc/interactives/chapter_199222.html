<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Halven continued to sprint through the Dark Forest. Not daring to look back, not daring to hesitate for a moment. He had to leave, had to get to the kingdom and warn them of these werebeasts. They were building an army after all. Converting travellers and warriors into their ranks. Kurt and Brixton had fallen, and who knows how many others were converted that had knowledge of the kingdom. If they continued to grow, then the humans stood no chance.<br />
<br />
Halvens chest becomes tighter as he pushes past his limits. Unsure of how long he has travelled now, how many minutes? Maybe an hour? He tries not to think of it. Tries to work through the fatigue as his feet start to burn. Breaths rapid as he can&#39;t hold out anymore, finally falling to his knees and taking a moments rest. The last remaining Hunter looking around, seeing the same forest, no signs of exit before him. Had he even made progress in this cursed place?<br />
<br />
Only a few more moments passed before the human heard movement around him. The werebeasts had followed him, and quicker than he thought. Halven had to run, he had to help the kingdom. His arms pushing against the ground in one desperate attempt to get on his feet and leave. But it all doing nothing, he could not muster the strength to get up. Only able to watch as a group of werelions stepped out of the greenery.<br />
<br />
He could not count how many, just knowing it was far too many of the beasts for him to take. Not that he could fight right now anyway, he was at their mercy. The athletic anthropomorphic lions circling the prone human. All male and with full manes, though a difference seen in size and fur colour. While they all had a uniform runners build, some were taller and some shorter. For low 6ft to high 7. Some white furred, others yellowed, others orange.<br />
<br />
But there was one clear similarity between every lion here. Their barbed cock erect and pulsing, dripping cat spunk onto the forests floor. One of the larger lion&#39;s taking the opportunity to walk over to Halven, lowering himself to the same level as the kneeling human.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a strong will. The pack will make good use of you.&quot;<br />
Halven wanted to defy them still, but he knew the reality of it all. His friends were already werebeasts, and now he would succumb to the same fate as them. There&#39;s no point in resisting, all he hopes is that he enjoys whatever life awaits him.<br />
&quot;Just make it quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few chuckles escaped the crowd as Halven felt a clawed hand grip the top of his head. The lion forcing his gaze, the two staring at one another for a moment before the werebeast brings the human into a kiss. Halven hesitant for only a moment before he feels the curse enter him and take hold. Eagerly kissing back the werelion as his mind thinks of only the pleasures that awaits. Of becoming a sexy werelion like the rest. Of returning to the pack and serving the alpha. Of extending their forces so they might one day conquer the kingdom.<br />
<br />
The werelion breaks the kiss, but continues to hold the hunters head. A cocky grin now present from the beast, the rest of the pack seeming just as amused.<br />
&quot;You still want it to be quick?&quot;<br />
Halven&#39;s mind has opened, desiring as much pleasure as possible as he defiantly shouts.<br />
&quot;No! Please I need to be initiated. I need to feel my new brothers!&quot;<br />
<br />
The leader stands as Halven tosses aside whatever gear he still has on his person. The other lions now surrounding the human. Drawing closer, lowering themselves for better access of his body. The first lion now having his barbed cock right before the desperate hunters face, bringing it closer alongside the movements of his group <br />
&quot;We want to feel you as well, my new brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The lion roars as everything suddenly begins. Halven opening his mouth as the cock passes his lips. Each barb impacting his opening on entry, brining a wave of pleasure with it before making the same impact on his tongue. The Hunter looking up to the toned body and smug grin of the lionman as he pulls his dick out and grants the same pleasure. Treating the human with a first taste of his future.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the rest of the pack begins to feel their new brother. Feeling any part of him they can. Nuzzling arms, chest, legs, cock. Pressing their fur against him, covering him in their feline scent. The procedure making him feel so sensitive, so strange. The curse spreading throughout him as black hair turns to black fur. Body quickly coated in his own warm covering.<br />
<br />
The leader of this group continues to thrust into the turning man, though once he spots the growth of fur his tactics change. Giving one more firm thrust then keeping his dick inside the man. Halven now pressed against the lions pubic fur... And in heaven. Smelling the wild and virile scent of this golden lion. It stinks of the forest, of the lions, of the alpha... Yes, the alpha. Halven is sure that the alpha has fucked this lion more than a few times. Maybe he&#39;ll be just as lucky to be fucked by their master. To feel his canine cock and ragged fur.<br />
<br />
Lost in pure bliss, his body grows in size. Growing to six and a half feet, as his already toned body gets a bit more definement. Showing off his arms, legs, and chest that were molded by the forests he runs through. Tail poking out and swaying absent-mindedly. Head extending into the visage of a lion. Dark furs growing into a mane as his features become wild and mouth fang filled. Ready to infect humans. Ready to have sex with his fellows.<br />
<br />
His new group leader rewards the convert with a flood of cream. Halven drinking the delicious juices as his own still human cock shoots it&#39;s last human load. Retreating inside the man&#39;s new sheath, before returning as a proud lion pole. His family finally giving him space as Halven takes a moment to smell the air and explore his new senses. Before standing with the rest of the pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;The alpha will want to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Halven grins. Looking forward to seeing his old friends Brixton and Kurt, alongside being of use to his Alpha and rewarding humanity with the gift of becoming a werebeast.</p>
