<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Andrew and Chris are finished cleaning themselves up, they take Andrew&#39;s car and drive down to the beach. When they get there, they see a lot of possibilities waiting to happen. There&#39;s are two young boys playing in the ocean, there&#39;s a family of four laying out in the sun, there&#39;s a group of guys and girls playing beach volleyball. But what caught Chris&#39; attention first was the young woman with her son building a sandcastle.<br />
Chris takes the device and types in the display, &quot;The woman with her son I&#39;m looking at will turn into a pair of strong, masculine men who are at the beach on a date.&quot;<br />
Chris waits until they set down their stuff behind the two before he hits enter so he can get the best view. Once he hits enter, he notably sees changes in the boy first. The boy is starting to get taller and within minutes he grows to be a little over 6&#39; tall. The mother while less drastic, also grows a few inches until she is around the same height as well. At this point he remembered that he didn&#39;t set them to be unaware, so the boy and the mother are in silent shock right now looking at each other&#39;s bodies. As the changes continue, the boy starts to get more muscular, filling out the tight swimshorts he has on at the moment, allowing you to see the slowly growing bulge being stretched out within. He starts feeling himself up as his pecs grow larger, groping and squeezing them with the large soccer ball sized biceps. He then starts to feel his stomach get lumpier and rubs his hand over them as the new six pack forms on his body.<br />
On the other hand, the mother is getting much more masculine in the process. As her muscles grows, she quickly notices that her boobs are dwindling into her chest, and as she reaches to grab them, she is now met with a solid set of pecs. Now that her bikini top is useless, she takes it off and gets a better view of her defined chest and rock hard abs. Then, she notices that her hips are starting to shrink as the muscles on her legs grow and change the look of her lower body. Where once was a small and petite set of legs was now a bulging set of strong thighs and calves. Eventually, her feet began to grow as well, almost doubling in size to match to her legs. Finally, her arms grow to be as large as her son&#39;s, which are rippling with well worked muscle. In a short instance, her and her son jump as that feel their asses expanding underneath them. With their now large, manly hands, they grab their butts. The mother notices how hard and how much smaller it feels, while the son realizes how much bigger and bulbous his round ass is now that it has grown.<br />
Suddenly, the mother bends back in pleasure as a small lump begins to poke out of her bikini bottom. Slowly, the lump grows until it is a penis about 8 inches long, with a set of egg sized balls below. As the son watched this, he started to feel tingly as his dick grew longer in his shorts, pushing against the already tight front of his pants. <br />
Just as the two thought their transformation was over, they started to feel another tingling through their bodies. The boy&#39;s head first started to grow as his chin became more define and his face gained a longer adult look. Then a bulge started to form in his throat and he groaned as it pushed awkwardly and notice how deep and bellowy his manly voice was now. As for the mother, her formerly dainty feature became more rigid and define as her chin jutted out further and more sharply than before. Like the son, she also gained an Adam&#39;s apple in her neck.<br />
Now, all that remained was to give them a more manly feature. At the same time, they noticed that their skin was getting itchier. It started at their feet as small hairs started poking out of the top of their large feet. Slowly it travelled up their legs and coated their calves and muscular thighs with a thick coating of hair. The hair continue to spread across their asses and onto their crotches where they both now had a large bush surrounding their also large cocks. Continuing upward, the hair grew up from their crotches and spread across their stomachs and coated their pecs with a thick layer of coarse hair. Both of them lifted their hands up to feel the hair and ran their fingers through it, noticing the weird sensation of having hair on their chests. The hair the spread over their arms and grew out into large tufts in their armpits, poking slightly out from underneath. Then as a final touch, they each gained a thick beard covering their jaws, making them look even manlier than before.<br />
As the changes began to end, both of them started feeling up their bodies in shock of their sudden changes. However Chris made them think it was normal and suddenly the idea of them being a little boy and a woman became strange. Now they were two lovers on the beach who came down on a date. Chris watched as the two began to turn to each other and kiss as they also groped each other&#39;s new bodies, with one sneakily sticking his hand down the other&#39;s pants, and began to settle into their new lives as hairy, muscular, gay boyfriend&#39;s. <br />
Chris and Andrew looked and we&#39;re happy with their product and began searching for new people to play with.</p>
