<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Before I tell you what I have planned,” Jane says, “do you have to scan someone, or is there an option, like a search function, where you type in someone’s name without having to scan them?”<br />
<br />
“I honestly don’t know,” Ben admits, “I haven’t had the program for that long and I still haven’t figured everything out yet. The only things I did was transforming my old toy into my dream car and myself into a 10-year-old, but other than that…”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Jane says, “why don’t you check and see if the app has a search function?”<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “I’ll do that now,” he says, he then opens the app once again and starts searching, after a few minutes a smile appears on his face, “I think I found something, it says here “Target search”. So, who would you like me to search for?”<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “I want you to first search for my mother, her name is Janet Thomas”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods and types in the name, it doesn’t take long for Jane’s mom to appear, even a picture of the searched person appears, “is this her,” Ben asks, showing Jane.<br />
<br />
“Yup, that’s her,” Jane says, “now, save her file, then search for my dad, his name is Cedrik Thomas”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods and soon Jane’s dad is also found, “alright, we got your parents,” Ben says, “who’s next,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
Over the next hour Ben searches and saves the files of every boy Jane had had a relationship with, in the end he had added 10 people to the file list. Ben lets out a whistle, “you really dated a lot of boys,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jane frowns and nods, “and every single one was a psychopath,” she says.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry, baby,” Ben says, he then smiles, “but now you have me”.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles back, “yeah, and you are 100% the right one. I just love everything about you, hun”.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “I can say the same about you,” he says, “I really hope we aren’t rushing it, I mean, it feels right, I feel that we belong together”.<br />
<br />
Jane takes Ben’s hand, “it IS and we BELONG together,” she says, “I have no doubt in my mind!”<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “so, what do you want me to do?”<br />
<br />
Jane grins, “I want you to simply erase all of them, my parents and exes, from existence and make everyone think that they had passed in a serve car accident and their ashes had been scattered into the ocean,” she says, “then I want you to alter the reality to make me be the owner of MY mansion, that I inherited it along with a large sum of money from my parents after they had passed away in the car accident five years ago”.<br />
<br />
Ben frowns, “that’s pretty dark,” he says, “who would have cared for you?”<br />
<br />
“A nanny, who’s contract run out when I turned 16 because I was old enough to care for myself,” Jane says.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Ben says, “what about your exes”.<br />
<br />
Jane scoffs and snorts, “who cares,” she asks, “they don’t deserve a “reason” for their non-existence!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, babe,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
After he had confirmed what Jane wanted, both feel the atmosphere around them tingle, “is it done,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “yes, it’s done,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles wide, “I feel a large weight being lifted from my shoulders,” she says.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “anything else, baby?”<br />
<br />
Jane smiles at him, “yes, I want you to move in with me!”<br />
<br />
Ben’s eyes widen, he then smiles, “I… I’d love to,” he says, “I just hope I fit into your crowed of people”.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “just us the app to make yourself rich,” she says.<br />
<br />
Ben thinks for a while, he then smiles, “I think I have a perfect idea,” he says, “I’ll just rewrite my history, that I dropped out of school at age 14 and created a successful business that made me a billionaire”.<br />
<br />
Jane grins, “I like that idea,” she says, “what kind of business?”<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “a tech company, that manufactures high end vehicles and aircraft for the public, military, government and space,” he says, “and that my company specializes in the creation of “smart”-vehicles”.<br />
<br />
“You mean vehicles with AI,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “correct, and this app will help me with that”.<br />
<br />
Jane grins, “and what about your family,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing a little reality alteration can’t fix,” he says, “I shall do that right now,” and with that Ben starts to rewrite his life, not only making himself a successful business man and billionaire at a young age, he also causes everyone to forget about Jeff, causing his parents and everyone that knows him, to think he had always been a single child. Ben mentally smirks, ‘the longer Jeff stays a car, the more he’ll start to think he had always been a car,’ he thinks to himself, ‘no need to alter him, hehe… he’ll be altering himself!’<br />
<br />
After setting up the change to his life and confirming it, Ben and Jane once again feel the atmosphere tingle.<br />
<br />
Ben suddenly lets out a groan, clutching his head, “babe… what wrong,” Jane asks with concern.<br />
<br />
“Whoa… that felt weird,” Ben mumbles, blinking a little, “my… my mind has just been bombarded with new memories”.<br />
<br />
“Like what,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben turns to Jane, a huge grin on his face, “I know how I built my business, where my business is, my private and business bank accounts, my wealth… there is even a homepage of my company, I even know that my company is selling all the products world wide,” he says, his grin widening, “70 percent of every AI-vehicle and aircraft, used by the public and government, has been manufactured by my company!”<br />
<br />
“Amazing,” Jane says, grinning herself, “do you also have employees?”<br />
<br />
Ben nods, his grin widening, “I do, the app has done an amazing job,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “the app made both our lives so much more interesting and better,” she says.<br />
<br />
“And happier,” Ben adds, kissing Jane on the lips.<br />
<br />
As they kiss, Ben’s phone suddenly rings, the display showing an unknown number, “hu? Who could that be at this hour,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
“Only one way to find out,” Ben says, he then answers the call, “yes? This is Ben Davis, who is this?”<br />
<br />
“Mister Davis,” a man’s voice is heard, “sorry to bother you at this hour. This is the president of the United States”.<br />
<br />
Ben’s eyes widen and he looks at Jane with disbelief, “it’s the president,” he mouths, Jane lets out a gasp, covering her mouth with her hand.<br />
<br />
“S-sir, I… what can I do for you,” Ben asks, his voice nervous.<br />
<br />
“No need to be nervous, mister Davis,” the president, who’s name is Han Wong, a democrat from Asian decent, born in the US, “I’m sorry for calling you at such a late hour, but I just stumbled upon your website, and I must say: I like what I am seeing and reading here. I have a project where I could use someone with your expertise, so, I’d like to invite you to the White House to discuss things further”.<br />
<br />
Ben is speechless, “s-sir, this… this is a lot to take in,” he finally says, “could… could you give me a day to consider, please?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, you have my number,” president Wong says, “just call me when you’ve decided”.<br />
<br />
“I will, sir,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“I’ll talk to you soon then, enjoy the rest of your evening,” Mister Wong says.<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks, sir,” Ben says, “you too,” he then ends the call and just stares at his phone.<br />
<br />
“Ben,” Jane asks, “baby, you alright?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… I’m fine,” Ben says, “it… I just didn’t expect… this!”<br />
<br />
Jane lies a hand on his shoulder and smiles, “I’m proud of you, baby”.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “all I did was alter my life and reality,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jane grins, “for the better,” she says, “things can only get better from this point forward!”<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “yeah, and I can’t be happier,” he says, the two hug each other, “what do you say we get out of here,” Ben then asks.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles and nods, “let’s head home to OUR mansion,” she says.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles wide, “yeah, let’s,” he says, the two get to their feet and walk back to Ben’s “car”, soon they are on their way, Ben grinning to himself all the way, yes, his life defiantly has taken a 360° turn for the better, he is sure of that: he has the hottest and richest girl as his girlfriend, he is an successful businessman and billionaire, he’s living in a mansion, all this and more, Ben feels, is what he deserves.<br />
<br />
When they arrive at the mansion, Ben simply parks the car in a free parking place in the large garage of the mansion, “I’ll need to change the garage door codes in the car’s system to be able to remotely open and close them,” he says as they step out, “I also need to change the home security codes in the car, since this is now my new home”.<br />
<br />
“Your car is able to open and close the garage, and activate and deactivate the house’s security system,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, smiling, “yep, the car has a secret compartment where there are three buttons, blue for the garage, green to deactivate the house’s security and red to activate it”.<br />
<br />
“That sure is useful,” Jane says, “but, can that until tomorrow? I have… something else planned to end the night,” she says, moving a hand down to cub Ben’s bulge, grinning up at the 16-year-old, “if you get my drift!”<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “oh, I certainly do,” he says, and the two walk into the mansion, leaving the “car” alone in the dark garage, but Jeff doesn’t mind, the former teen, oblivious to his fate and to what Ben had done to the reality, is just happy that his twin brother has finally found the right girl, with that thought, Jeff falls “asleep” as his brother… his owner… locks the “car”, sending Jeff into sleep-mode.</p>
