<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nicole paused and took a deep breath.  “You see, Joe and I are twins.  I’m not sure if that was apparent to <br />
you or not, because not everyone seems to see that.  But that’s not important.  We’re twins, but…we’re also a <br />
bit…closer than that.”<br />
<br />
Edward darted his eyes back and forth between us.  He appeared confused at first.  Then I realized he wasn’t <br />
confused.  Instead he appeared afraid, or at least wary of what he just heard.  “Ya mean you’re lovers?” he <br />
asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” said Nicole.  “I can’t explain it all now, but it’s the truth, and we feel you would have to be <br />
comfortable with that in order to work for us.  So I have to ask, right now, is that something you can live <br />
with?”<br />
<br />
Edward opened his mouth, but no words emerged.  He closed his mouth and looked at each of us again.  Finally <br />
he said, “I can’t say I’ve ever considered something like that.  Just not something I ever pondered.  But I <br />
gotta tell ya, I’m not some nosy busy body.  I’ve always felt people’s lives are their own business.  You <br />
folks were kind enough to let me into your home, which is much more than most people woulda done.  Something <br />
tells me you’re both decent people.  And you’re willing to give me a job.  So I gotta say that, no, I don’t <br />
think that would bother me.  I’d be happy to work for ya no matter what.”<br />
<br />
Nicole smiled and stood up.  She walked over to Edward, who rose out of his chair as she approached.  “Edward, <br />
you’re hired!” she said as she extended her hand.  He shook it as a smile crept onto his face.  I walked over <br />
and shook his hand as well.  “Let’s go upstairs and get you situated,” she said.  Again she took him by the <br />
arm and led him up the staircase.  I followed close behind them.<br />
<br />
I had realized that some of the rooms on the second floor that I couldn’t identify were intended to be <br />
servant’s quarters.  I didn’t go into them far enough to notice the bathrooms, and they did not have beds in <br />
them on our first inspection.  After we had wished the house to be in livable condition, they appeared.<br />
<br />
As we walked up the stairs, I wished for one of the rooms to be fully prepared and have a full wardrobe ready.  <br />
Edward asked, “So is this a live-in type position?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” said Nicole.  “Now we won’t expect you to be working all the time, but we definitely want you to <br />
consider this your home now.”<br />
<br />
“I expect that will be the easy part of the job,” he said.  Nicole and I laughed, followed by Edward once he <br />
realized we were not laughing at him.<br />
<br />
Nicole led him to the room that would be his.  “This is your room,” she said.  “Obviously you can see <br />
everything it has to offer.”  Other than the bed, which was king-sized, the room had a television, a desk, a <br />
large dresser, a walk-in closet and a couple of shelving units that were empty.  It appeared they were meant <br />
to store books or movies.  “The bathroom is through here,” she said as she led the way.  The bathroom wasn’t <br />
quite as nice as the bathrooms on the third floor, but it was still nicer than most any bathroom I’d ever <br />
seen.<br />
<br />
“This is really too much,” said Edward.<br />
<br />
“Nonsense,” said Nicole.  “You’re a human being, you deserve to be comfortable.  Now we’re still getting <br />
situated ourselves, so we don’t expect you to do anything today.  We just want you to relax and get used to <br />
the surroundings.  Feel free to explore the house and grounds.  The kitchen is downstairs, just take anything <br />
you want.”<br />
<br />
“You’re really too kind,” said Edward.<br />
<br />
“Edward, it’s the least we can do,” I said.  “We’re not going to treat you like a second-class person or <br />
anything.  There’s nothing special about us.  We’ve had our own hard times, nothing like what you had, but <br />
we’ve been incredibly lucky and we want to help others as much as we can.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” he said.<br />
<br />
“There’s only one real rule of the house,” I said.  “We keep all of the doors open so that the atmosphere is <br />
open.  If any doors are closed, it basically means ‘Do Not Disturb.’  At the very least it means knock first.  <br />
And the same goes for you.  Just close your door if you don’t want to be disturbed.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll leave you to it,” Nicole said.<br />
<br />
“I just want to say how much I appreciate this chance,” he said.  “I sure I hope I don’t disappoint ya.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” I said.  “Just take your time and get used to it all, OK?”<br />
<br />
“OK,” he said.  “Uh…I guess you could close the door on your way out.  I’d like to take a bath and whatnot.”<br />
<br />
“No problem,” said Nicole.  “Everything you need is in the bathroom or in here.”  We walked out and closed the <br />
door.  Then we both ran up the stairs to the third floor as quickly and quietly as we could.  “Do you think we <br />
need to keep an eye on him?” she asked me.<br />
<br />
“No,” I said.  “What a terrible thing to do to this man.”<br />
<br />
“We have to test the ring, though,” she said.<br />
<br />
“We already did,” I said.  “By wishing him to the door.”<br />
<br />
“I want you to make another wish,” she said.  “For our protection.”<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She replied, “He told us he’s OK with our doing what we’re doing.  But suppose he tells someone?  Even if it’s <br />
accidental, we need to make sure it doesn’t happen.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “I wish that Edward would not remember that we are lovers anytime he leaves the property of the <br />
mansion, or if someone from outside the property is on the property.  That should cover it.”<br />
<br />
“You could have just wished him to forget what we are doing,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Well you’re the one who brought it up in the first place!” I protested.<br />
<br />
Nicole’s expression turned sour.  “Let’s go to my room,” she said.  “I want to test something a little <br />
different.”</p>
