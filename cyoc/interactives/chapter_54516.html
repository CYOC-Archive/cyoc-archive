<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'm Sarah by the way,&quot; the pink-haired girl said as she led the group into the building.  &quot;Your friend Mike had quite the effect on us before he left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean dropped the unconscious Josh on the sofa in the common room of the dorm.  Josh bounced once and remained still.  The two high-school girls huddled together near one wall and eyed the rest of the people in the room.  Dean standing tall and proud had apparently been elected the leader.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see what he did to you,&quot; Dean said to Sarah before looking at the others.  &quot;Huh.  He seems to have been following a theme with you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seated in the large room were a few members of the Girls-Dorm.  They were watching TV, doing homework or just talking amongst themselves.  Aside from Sarah, the white haired cat-girl there a broad spectrum of creatures.  Sitting together at a table covered in text-books were a girl with a single, short horn emerging from her forehead with long, silver hair and a matching pony tail; one with two wire-like antennae emerging from green hair who sported delicate fairy-wings; and one that seemed normal with long reddish hair who seemed to be sitting cross-legged until Dean noticed she was a mermaid.<br />
<br />
Laying on the couch there was girl with silver toned skin who wore a light-blue plastic skull cap.  She turned to look at the new comers and Dean saw she was supposed to be a robot.  Her skin was shiny silver with dark lines draw in places to make it look like she was jointed mechanically.  As he looked closely, though, he could see that it was just a trick of the colouring and it was skin, not metal that covered her.  On her belly another plastic panel was placed and over time it seemed to fade from one colour to another.  Her face that was normally toned, hung open when she saw Jen and Naomi.<br />
<br />
All of the girls sported huge, round, fake breasts with large nipples.  Whatever Mike was into, it seemed that he felt every girl needed huge breasts.  What was more, all of them were topless.  Dean thought that Naomi would not stand out too much in this place.  He was wrong, however.  Every pair of eyes turned to look at the new pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Sarah exclaimed.  &quot;I didn't notice you outside, but damn, that Mike guy must have done a number on you girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a murmuring about the room.  The robot-girl jumped out of the seat and walked forward to get a better view.  &quot;Just what are you supposed to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, a fairy-ballerina-princess?&quot; Naomi said meekly.  She had wanted to get attention but somehow, this was not the kind she had wanted.  &quot;And this was not the work of Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you covered in?&quot; the unicorn-girl called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Latex-rubber,&quot; Naomi said.  Her own breasts which had been growing steadily for the past forty minutes were much larger than the other girls.  She sporting utility-ball sized breasts for the second time that night.<br />
<br />
Sarah had moved closer to Dean while the other boarders gathered around Naomi and Jen.  They seemed completely taken by their stories and were eager to tell their own.  Sarah on the other hand found Dean more interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite strong to be able to lift that guy on your own,&quot; she said getting close.  &quot;You must be very strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; Dean muttered.  He was normally used to high-school girls hitting on him.  They would usually giggle and smile from a distance.  This Sarah was different.  The fact that she was much older than Dean and that she was already more naked than any other girl he had seen made him feel uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you dress so well,&quot; Sarah complemented.  She reached out to feel his sweater.  &quot;Is this fine, pre-shrunk, wool?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's magic.  My clothes change to whatever a girl wants me to wear.&quot;  Dean kicked himself mentally for saying so blatantly.<br />
<br />
Sarah stepped even closer and her large breast bumped into Dean's shoulder.  &quot;Oops.  Sorry.  I'm still getting used to these things.  I only got them tonight,&quot; she said smiling.  Sarah inched back but she kept one breast close to Dean so that when either of them moved a little it would press up against his arm.  Dean found it distracting.<br />
<br />
Sarah whispered something and Dean felt his clothing shift.  Looking down he found he was now wearing a fine blue and green kilt.  He looked at Sarah with a cocked eye-brow in question and she smiled even wider.  &quot;I always liked a man in a kilt.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Dean tried to think of a response he suddenly found himself shirtless and wearing a cow-boy hat.  He heard Sarah gasp and giggle to herself.  &quot;You know, a friend of mine told me about clothing fetishes tonight.  I didn't really believe her but I think I am starting to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help playing.  It must be the cat in me,&quot; Sarah said almost laughing.  &quot;Or the beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<br />
&quot;So he asks me why I don't like watching TV and I don't have a really good answer.  So he makes me look like a robot and says that now I have to watch four hours of TV each day to keep me human.  The plus side is that it counts as double-sleep time so I will have more free time.  I still spend the other four hours as a robot but that's not so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen just could not get the silly robot to stop talking.  Try as she might to but in the girl still did not seem to get the hint that Jen did not care.  If Mike was not around then they should just move on, Jen thought.  Eventually she had enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I don't care what Mike did to you.  You get a nice pair of tits out of it.  So why don't you go back to watching TV and get them out of my face.&quot;  Jen was sick of being only four feet tall.  When she had her other body she was a statuesque-blond.  Now every pair of tits in the room was at eye-poking height.  The robot turned and mechanically made her way back to the couch.  Apparently while she looked like a robot she also had to obey instructions like one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, calm down,&quot; Naomi snapped.  &quot;We will find Mike soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Naomi, but I just want to leave.  Can't we just go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not until Josh wakes up.  He's the only one that knows about Mike.  For now just enjoy these crazy girls.  Hey, look!  A goth-angel.&quot;  Naomi pointed at a girl that breezed through the room.  Her mini-black wings and glowing red horns drew the eye.  Her standard issue hooters were obscured by a dark puff of smoke that trailed away after her as she walked.<br />
<br />
Jen just pouted.  It was no fun when she was just one more hottie in the crowd.</p>
