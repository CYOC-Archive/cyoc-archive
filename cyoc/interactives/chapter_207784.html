<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Axel and his father ate a delicious dinner of steaks and his dad helped him make twice-baked potatoes. <br />
<br />
The teenage wolfman was excited to help out in the kitchen. His dad, a hulking wolfman, could eat a lot, so he had to devote all his attention to the grill. They sat down and ate, but for some reason his dad made salad too. Gross.<br />
<br />
The salad his dad forced him to eat was actually pretty good-though he wondered why his father had taken out his phone while he was scolding him for being picky. Eating healthy was what all good wolves did if they wanted to grow big and muscular, like their dads. He even got a bowl of ice cream sprinkled with protein powder after his evening workout!<br />
<br />
After dinner and post-workout, they watched a movie together about a man trapped in a skyscraper. <br />
<br />
Mr. Huff demanded Axel sit next to him, which was kinda weird. Then the older wolf pulled out his phone and typed something and Axel snuggled up against his father. The older wolf pulled him tight to his chest. Axel loved the soft rise and fall of his father’s muscular chest and the warmth of his fur. They only had each other, after all. The movie was really good, but it was later at night when it ended. He was exhausted when he finally climbed into bed. <br />
<br />
Axel woke up to Mr. Huff shaking him roughly. He rubbed his bleary eyes and glanced at his clock. 5 AM. No wonder he was so tired!<br />
<br />
“Get up. We’re going on a morning run.” Mr. Huff sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five minutes, dad!&quot; Axel complained.<br />
<br />
His father pulled out his phone, and a few seconds later, Axel suddenly felt weirdly energized. He rolled out of bed, drank a glass of water, then met his father outside. They ran silently together in the dark, and Axel started lagging behind, exhausted. Mr. Huff got exasperated and pulled out his phone. Axel somehow got a second wind and found himself enjoying the experience. The cool air against his fur, the energy suffusing his lithe form, it was like he was born for it. Together, they ran for two miles, then came back and took their showers.<br />
<br />
“You can expect this every weekday morning.” Mr. Huff glowered when they were in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Okay, dad!” Axel grinned, wagging his tail as he made his father breakfast.<br />
<br />
“What?” Mr. Huff look confused.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for letting me run with you, I really enjoyed it!” Axel brought a big plate of eggs and ham and toast to his father. “Here’s breakfast. Over easy, like you wanted.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Mr. Huff sputtered. “I thought you’d hate running with me.”<br />
<br />
“Why would I hate running with you?” Axel chuckled and held up a stein. &quot;Coffee in here.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff went silent and busied himself with his meal. Axel knew he enjoyed it because his tail was wagging slowly. Every once in a while he’d shoot a glance over at Axel. Axel smiled happily and dug into his own plate.<br />
<br />
“I want you on the football team.” Mr. Huff spoke up suddenly.<br />
<br />
“You mean Coach Higgens will let me?” Axel said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“What?” Mr. Huff’s tail drooped when he saw the excitement in his son’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Coach Higgens runs the team. Doesn’t let anyone on he doesn’t approve of.” Axel said. “Didn’t you know?”<br />
<br />
“Right.” Mr. Huff murmured, stroking his muzzle. “Mr. Higgens. Do I make you good enough? Then what’s the point of making you work out if you just get it all handed to you? Hmmm…”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s too late to sign up now. They started playing back in August.” Axel shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll talk to Mr. Higgens later.&quot; Mr Huff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so excited? You hated football.&quot; Mr Huff growled sullenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I wanna be just like you. Weren&#39;t you a star player?&quot; Axel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Who am I to you, Axel?&quot; Mr. Huff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad.&quot; Axel replied promptly.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looked put off. &quot;Did the name change do that...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what, dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your mom.&quot; Mr. Huff snapped his fingers. &quot;Don&#39;t you miss her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel&#39;s tail lowered, and Mr. Huff savored his anguish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss her every day, dad. But at least I still have you.&quot; Axel said solemnly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Err...&quot; Mr. Huff blinked, horror welling in his gut. &quot;Your mother&#39;s first name was...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah,&quot; Axel furrowed his brow. &quot;Are you okay? You&#39;ve been acting weird the last few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;But she died in an accident 13 years ago! How could it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, right after she gave birth to me.&quot; Axel nodded. <br />
<br />
The wolf stood up abruptly and paced the kitchen, looking incredibly agitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Axel asked.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff shook his head and looked at the clock. &quot;Shit. Get your backpack, it&#39;s time for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
They drove to school. His dad was busy fiddling with his phone at every stoplight, reading something. He looked really distracted. They pulled up to the school in his father&#39;s designated parking spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, son.&quot; Mr. Huff licked his lips as though tasting the word. &quot;Go to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to join the football team!&quot; Axel giggled happily to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;No giggling!&quot; Mr Huff snapped. &quot;I&#39;ll...figure out a punishment for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dad.&quot; Axel rolled his eyes. &quot;But football team. How do you think I&#39;ll do?&quot;<br />
<br />
“I expect you’ll be a great disappointment.” Mr. Huff growled, though his tail wagged and Axel knew he didn’t mean it.<br />
<br />
“At least I’ll be great.” Axel smirked.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff chuckled then seemed to catch himself and cleared his throat. “Yeah, yeah, get to class, smartass.”<br />
<br />
Axel walked away and then yelped when his father swatted him.<br />
<br />
“Move with a purpose!” His dad barked.<br />
<br />
Axel grinned, rubbing his furry rump, and ran to class. He made it just as the first bell rang. Class was boring and he couldn’t wait to go to gym so he could ask Coach Higgens if he could join the team.</p>
