<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the privileges of being president of Moon Lake College is access to certain sealed records of Moon Lake.  For academic purposes, of course.  So it was with Dean Myers in his home office surrounded by his papers of various kinds.  In his hands were the files of certain wereraccoon.  Despite it being the twenty-first century, Moon Lake still maintained paper records.  While it would have been easier and faster to put these records in a digital format, the town considered it too great of a risk for the population.  All it would take is a single hack, and the secret of Moon Lake would be out like a cat out of a bag.  Thus, the town stuck with paper records as to keep track of who was what.<br />
<br />
So it was that Dean Myers was looking through Alice Decrux&#39;s file, trying to learn what was bothering him about her.  What he learned is that she was a natural born wereraccoon, born in the late 1930&#39;s.  Graduated from high school, moved away, and opened up her own shop.  Then, starting in the 1970&#39;s, she started legal proceedings against certain men for child support.  According to the town records, she&#39;d born several cubs, about 15 years apart, all to different men.  She would then sue for child support for that cub, which the courts would grant her.  Dean would notice a pattern, though, is that all of the men that sired her cubs were normals turned wereraccoons.  This was something that Dean found a bit odd.<br />
<br />
Looking deeper into the files, he discovered something that really made his blood run cold.  She was charged with a Statute 1A* violation twice.  Once in 1982 and again in 2008.  While she wasn&#39;t convicted, her defense was that it was all an accident, and the prosecution could never prove intent.  Thus, in both cases, she was found not guilty of violating Statute 1A.  Once was an accident, but twice is a coincidence.  Three times, though, and it&#39;d be a pattern.<br />
<br />
Once Dean was finished reading the reports, he uttered a low growl.  Even though it wasn&#39;t really his fault, he couldn&#39;t help but feel that he could have prevented Yvette Smith from scratching William Anderson**.  If this really was Ms. Decrux&#39;s game, Dean knew he had to stop her.  He wasn&#39;t about to let Mr. Jenkins face the same fate as Mr. Anderson.  Not while he was around.  He sat back in his chair, the light on his desk being the only thing lighting the room.  He pondered his next move.  Should he contact the wereraccoon rep on the council?  Or should he directly confront Ms. Decrux himself?<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Alice Decrux was still fuming.  She was spying on the Jenkin&#39;s house for hours, even after Virginia and Trevor left.  So far, her efforts to seduce Harold haven&#39;t worked.  It was hard to say if Virginia was winning him over, but Alice knew she couldn&#39;t take any chances.  Once she changed Harold into a wereraccoon, he&#39;d be hers, and he&#39;d be her next &quot;sugar daddy&quot;.  The problem is that he wasn&#39;t falling for it, and it was frustrating her to no end.  Most of the time, the men she seduced were lonely single men, flattered than an attractive woman like her was giving him the time of day.  In the 50 some-odd years she&#39;d be doing this, it wasn&#39;t this hard.  Only twice had she resort to more...physical methods to being them to her way.  Fortunately, she did it in a way that it looked like an accident.  Climb up high somewhere, &quot;fall&quot;, and one simple swipe of her claws.  She wondered if she&#39;d have to do the same with Mr. Jenkins.<br />
<br />
But, no, that was a risky move and a last resort at that.  There were other things that she could try first.  She leaned back and took a breath, refreshing herself on what she knew about men.  First, they need support.  Someone to watch the home for them while they went off to work.  Usually, although in this time and age, this was less certain.  The other thing she knew about men is that they love to feel needed.  Maybe instead of directly trying to play on his baser instincts, maybe she could look like some sort of woman who needs help.  Maybe an odd job here and there, and maybe something that could really play on his provider instincts.<br />
<br />
She gave a grin to herself as she worked the plan out.  Yes, appear that she needed him, bring him closer like that.  A bit of flattery, praise, and flirting, and he&#39;d be putty in her hands.  The only trouble is that daughter of his and her neighbor who seemed to be visiting him as often as she was.  Is there a way to rub both of them out of the picture?  Well, one thing at a time.  Just focus on him and get him to see her in a different light.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
*Statute 1A: Knowing and willfully changing a normal against his or her will results in a minimum 50 year prison term.<br />
