<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon and Kim hadn&#39;t really noticed much of a change while they fucking. Perhaps Simon had a little less energy than when they started. 4 years didn&#39;t add much asides from maybe a few worry lines around his eyes. But he was at least able to finish one last round of sex with Kim before she was no longer his wife.<br />
<br />
Kim gave a contented sigh before leaning against Simon, &quot;Ready for round 2?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I&#39;d like that, we do need to get moving on,&quot; said Simon, &quot;Amy will be here any minute.&quot; He found himself a bit surprised at that. Amy had been John&#39;s girlfriend, well, while he was still old enough. He couldn&#39;t think of why she&#39;d be here until he recalled she was now their kids&#39; babysitter. Leaving himself at half-awareness can catch him by surprise at times, though that was part of the thrill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right, her,&quot; said Amy before getting out of bed and starting to get dressed. Simon took the time to appreciate her naked form before getting out of bed and getting dressed himself. He had a feeling something was going to change relationship with Kim, but he wasn&#39;t sure what yet.<br />
<br />
Kim wore a nice green dress while Simon put a polo and jeans. By the time they went down stairs, Amy was already waiting for them. Simon noticed that Amy was definitely older, looking 25 now. The extra years of maturity did a lot of good for her. Her red top revealed that her stomach was toned as she still found time in her busy schedule to go for long walks and hit the gym. Her jean shorts revealed that her legs were quite supple from all that walking as well. Amy smiled at them and said, &quot;Simon, Kim, you look nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you,&quot; said Simon appreciatively. He could see why John thought she was so attractive. It was a pity Simon didn&#39;t have time to focus on her when he was going through his own swap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really appropriate to wear around the kids?&quot; asked Kim a little icily.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re just kids,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but they&#39;re at an impressionable age now,&quot; said Kim, &quot;Nichole will want to start dressing like you and Johnny will start fantasizing about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Johnny will start fantasizing about her anyways,&quot; said Simon, &quot;You know what little boys are like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim glared at him, &quot;And you want to encourage that?&quot; Of course, most of her hostility came from jealous possessiveness. She didn&#39;t like their children being watched over by a woman only 5 years younger than her. A sexy, beautiful woman at that. Kim hadn&#39;t been bothered when Amy was young and her children were toddlers. But puberty treated Amy well asides from the height department. Kim was confident in her own sexy body, but she didn&#39;t trust Simon not to ogle her, 9 year age gap be damned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Nichole&#39;s getting older and she won&#39;t need me for much longer,&quot; said Amy, &quot;I just want to spend a little more time with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Everything will be fine,&quot; said Simon, patting Kim&#39;s hand. However, the motion jostled Kim&#39;s suddenly-looser wedding ring off her finger. &quot;Oops,&quot; said Simon as the ring bounced across the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it,&quot; said Amy, reaching down and picking up the ring. Just then, Simon felt a charge in the air as both women seemed to zone out. He soon realized that a big change was coming so he backed away so he could look at them properly. In a trance, Amy slipped the wedding ring onto her own finger. Her top started stretching down, covering her stomach before going past her jean shorts which soon disappeared. Her casual shoes became high heels as her top became a fancy red dress. 5 years of maturity was added to her, namely in the form of larger breasts and a rounder rear as a result of having two children. Her stomach lost some of its tone, but it wasn&#39;t saggy. Extra makeup and jewelry appeared on her, finishing her change into a mature woman of 30 ready to go out on a date.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s changes were the exact opposite. Her high heels became casual shoes as her dress went up. It slid up over her pelvis, which were now wearing jean shorts before settling just above her naval as it came a more casual green top. Her body became fresher as she lost 5 years, along with the stubborn baby weight. She wasn&#39;t as toned as Amy was as while Kim did watch her figure, she wasn&#39;t as athletic. Her makeup and jewelry disappeared as she settled into the the casual role of a 25-year old babysitter.<br />
<br />
Amy was the first to come out of her trance, &quot;You...know...Nichole really looks up to you. I think she&#39;ll be upset when you stop babysitting her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s mind restarted, forgetting the familial connection she had with the Johnsons. &quot;She&#39;s a great kid,&quot; said Kim, &quot;She makes wish I had a daughter like her. Well, maybe in a few years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be a great mother someday,&quot; said Amy before turning to Simon, &quot;Ready to go, dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon was rather surprised that Amy was now his wife, but he wasn&#39;t complaining. His only real regret was not spending time with her when they were younger. Though his new memories told him that had spent a lot of time together when they were younger, in spite of the 4 year gap between them. He might have knocked her up with Nichole a little too early, but they were still a happy couple. And Simon was curious about what the Chronivac was up to. &quot;Uh, I just remembered something,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; He quickly hurried up the stairs. He wasn&#39;t worried about leaving the two of them alone. Amy didn&#39;t have to feel jealous around Kim, not for much longer anyways.<br />
