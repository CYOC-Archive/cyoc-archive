<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felicia was heading to find the vaccine, but Barry stopped her before she left. "Felicia," said Barry, "watch your back." "Don't worry," she replied. "It's just, no one wants to lose you again. Oh, before I forget, take these." Barry handed her the silver bullet clips. "Barry, I can't take those. You need them. Besides, I got this." She showed him the katana she brought along. "I thought your ancestors retired that blade three centuries ago," said Barry. "They did," said Felicia, "but I decided to bring it out of retirement. Watch the girl for me." "I will. Take care of yourself." Felicia headed out to find the vaccine. She made her way to the laboratory located in the B1 Basement of the mansion. Suddenly, she got a radio call. "Felicia, it's Barry. Do you copy?" "Yeah. What's up?" "There's something I forgot to tell you. About two hours ago, we lost contact with Gunther and Annie" "Where were they?" "They were in the lab. Everything seemed fine until the communication was cut." "They probably busted there radios trying to fight some of those creatures." "Hopefully. Worst case scenario, they've become infected. Where are you?" "In the lab. I see no one here. Wait a minute. Something doesn't smell right." "If you find them and they're fine, get 'em back her. If they're infected, you know what to do." "Roger that. How's the girl?" "She's stable for now. I'd say she's got an hour until she changes "I better hurry then. Felicia out." She continued to search the lab until she came across a beaker reading, "Z-Virus Vaccine." She grabbed two syringes and filled them with the vaccine. One for Michelle and another one just in case the other syringe was destroyed. On her way out, she heard something behind her. She shifted to human form in case those were her missing comrads. Turning around, she saw Gunther and Annie. "Am I glad I found you guys," she said, "Barry and the others are waiting for us in the infirmary." All they did was give Felicia a little grin. "What are you smilling for?" "You naive agent," said Annie, "You have no idea what is happening around you do you?" "What do you mean?" "It's simple," replied Gunther, "We've been under Umbrella's payroll for sometime now. It was our mission to make sure you all were eliminated. I didn't expect you and your team to make it this far." "You traitorous bitches!" yelled Felicia. "Now, we must finish the job," said Annie, "We'll make sure you don't get the girl the vaccine. We could study her and the virus' effects in order to make it even more powerful." "You think you can kill me just like that? You guys are pathetic." "Are we? About an hour ago, we each injected ourselves with the virus. It should be taking effect right about now." They began to transform. Felicia was not sure what they were becoming but she knew it was bad. The two rogue agents continued to transform. Annie was transforming into some sort of harpy. Gunther, on the other hand, was changing into some sort of lion. Knowing she was in trouble, Felicia shifted to her hybrid form. "Well what do we have here?" said Annie, "Looks like a member of S.T.A.R.S Omega Team has already become one of us." "Dream on Annie," yelled Felicia, drawing her blade, "I'll never be one of you!" She rushed to attack them both. They were still transforming, making them easy targets. Before they could do anything, she slashed Gunther in the throat and Annie in the stomach. Leaving the lab, she got a radio call. "This is Chris. Felicia, where are you" "I'm leaving the lab. I found the vaccine." "Great. Listen, Barry had me set C4 charges all around the Mansion. The timer is set for 15 minutes. Hurry back." "You got it, I'm heading back now." She rushed back as fast as she could. In no time, she had arrived at the infirmary. Barry was the first to greet her. "So what of Annie and Gunther?" he asked. "It's sort of complicated," she responded, "They were working for Umbrella the whole time. They tried to kill me and take the girl before she could be cured." "You got the vaccine?" "Yeah. Let's just hope it works." Felicia pulled out the syringe and tried to inject Michelle with it. But before she could, a knife came from out of no where and shattered the syringe. Felicia turned around only to see Annie. "Is that Annie," asked Chris. "Yeah, that's her," replied Felicia. Chris and Barry pointed their guns at Annie but, before they could do anything she said, "Fools! Felicia was planning to inject the girl with another doseage of the virus. She injected Gunther. I had to kill him because of her." Her body was hidden in the shadows so they couldn't see what she'd become. Barry pointed his gun at Felicia. "What are you doing? Don't tell me you believe her." "I don't know what to believe anymore." "Barry listen to me. You know me. I would never do anything like that." Barry fired a shot, but not at Felicia. The bullet hit Annie right in the leg. The silver from the bullet made Annie cry out in pain. But before they could do anything, Michelle began to transform. "The girl!" yelled Chris. Felicia ran back to her and pulled out the other syringe and injected Michelle with it. But her change did not stop. They all watched and Annie laughed as she said, "The virus has run it's course. You're too late!"</p>
