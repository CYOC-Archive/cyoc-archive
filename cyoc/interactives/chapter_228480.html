<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff walked down the hallway towards the living room, he could feel a strange sense of excitement bubbling up within him. His heart pounded in his chest like a drum as he approached the door and gently pushed it open.  Inside, he found his father sitting on the couch, looking at him with confusion etched on his face.  “Jeff, what&#39;s going on?”  he asked, his voice filled with concern.  Jeff couldn&#39;t help but smile as he looked at his father. “ Just sit back and relax, Dad”  he said, his voice filled with anticipation.  “You&#39;re about to become the woman of my dreams.”   As the words left his lips, Jeff could see the confusion in his father&#39;s eyes turn to fear. But before he could say anything else, the transformation began.  His father&#39;s body began to convulse, his muscles twitching and spasming as they began to grow and reshape themselves. His skin darkened, taking on a rich, earthy hue as his features began to change. His jawline became more defined, his cheekbones higher and more prominent. His eyes changed from a dull blue to a vibrant brown, their gaze becoming more intense and captivating.  His body hair disappeared from his chest and face but where it remained it thickened and grew darker, tastefully covering his now muscular body in a thick layer of black fur, it was clear Sarah was an au natural girl. His chest flattened and broadened, becoming a wall of solid muscle that rippled.<br />
<br />
His once slender arms bulged, the muscles rippling beneath the skin as they expanded and hardened into powerful biceps and triceps. His hands, once soft and delicate, became large and calloused, the fingers thickening and the nails growing longer and sharper. His legs followed suit, the muscles in his thighs and calves expanding until they were as thick as tree trunks, <br />
covered in a dense layer of dark hair. His waist thickened, the muscles in his abdomen hardening into a solid six-pack that was more akin to a 20 year old female bodybuilder&#39;s than a middle-aged man&#39;s. His hips widened, giving him an hourglass figure that was both powerful and feminine. His buttocks tightened and lifted, becoming firm and round. His father&#39;s clothes strained against his changing form, the fabric stretching and tearing as his body continued to grow. His shirt ripped open, revealing a smooth broad chest. His pants split at the seams, unable to contain the muscular thighs and calves that now filled them. As he watched his father&#39;s transformation, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of awe. He had never seen anything so beautiful, so powerful. He could hardly believe that this was his father – or rather, his dream girlfriend. Sarah, he breathed out, his voice filled with wonder. His father – now Sarah – looked up at him with wide eyes. She was panting heavily, her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath. Her hair had grown long and thick, falling down her back in a wild cascade of black curls. “ Jeff?” she asked, her voice deep and husky. “What… what happened?”  “ You&#39;re my dream girl now” Jeff said with a grin. “And you&#39;re perfect.” Sarah looked down at herself, her eyes wide with shock. But then she looked back up at Jeff and smiled – a genuine smile that lit up her face and made her eyes sparkle. I guess I am, she said, her voice filled with a newfound confidence. And I think I like it. Jeff couldn&#39;t help but smile back at her. This was better than he could have ever imagined. Sarah took Jeff by the arm and leading him to the master bedroom saying “Jeff I need you to give my vagina some attention.” <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes roamed over Sarah&#39;s newly transformed body, his gaze lingering on the furry juncture between her muscular thighs. He could see the soft folds of her womanhood, glistening with arousal. Her labia were plump and inviting, a deep shade of pink that contrasted beautifully with her hairydark skin. The scent of her arousal was intoxicating, a heady mix of musk and sweetness that made his mouth water.   He leaned in, his tongue darting out to taste her. She was sweet and tangy, a flavor that was uniquely hers. He traced the contours of her folds with his tongue, exploring every crevice and dip. He could feel her shudder beneath him, her hands gripping his hair as he delved deeper.  Her clit was hard and swollen, peeking out prominently from its hood. He flicked it with his tongue, eliciting a gasp from Sarah. <br />
<br />
He continued to tease it, alternating between light licks and hard sucks that had her writhing beneath him.  He could feel her getting wetter, her juices coating his lips and chin. He reveled in the taste of her, savoring every drop. His fingers joined his mouth, slipping inside her to stroke her inner walls. She was hot and tight around him, her muscles clenching around his fingers in a rhythm that matched the fluttering of her heart.  Jeff continued to eat Sarah out with fervor, driven by the sounds of pleasure she was making. Her deep moans filled the room, growing louder with each stroke of his tongue and thrust of his fingers. He could feel her nearing climax, her body tensing up as she rode the waves of pleasure he was giving her.  Finally, with one last lick to her clit and a curl of his fingers inside her, Sarah came undone beneath him. Her body arched off the bed as she climaxed, her cries of pleasure echoing through the room. Jeff continued to lap at her, drawing out her orgasm until she was spent and panting beneath him.  He pulled back, his lips glistening with her juices. He looked up at Sarah, his eyes meeting hers. She was flushed and glowing, a satisfied smile on her face. He couldn&#39;t help but return the smile, knowing that he had given her pleasure. Hopping off the bed Sarah hummed a chipper tune and strutted into the walk-in closet. <br />
<br />
Jeff sat at the kitchen table on his laptop with his program installed as Sarah strutted into the room, Jeff could hardly believe his eyes. She was wearing a t-shirt with the arms ripped off, cargo shorts, a backwards cap, and sneakers. Her muscles were even more pronounced now, bulging beneath her tight shirt and shorts. She looked like closer to a powerlifter, all muscle and power.  “Yo, bro!”  she called out, striking a pose that showed off her impressive biceps.  “That was some good shit earlier! But now I gotta hit the showers and get ready for some late-night reps with the boys!” Jeff watched in disbelief as Sarah grabbed a leftover rotisserie chicken from the fridge and started tearing into it with her hands. She chugged milk straight from the carton, not caring about the mess she was making. He quickly turned back to his computer, pulling up Sarah&#39;s profile on the Chronivac program. He watched in horror as her IQ gradually ticked down, while her confidence gradually ticking upward and her politeness levels also decreased. He tried to reverse the changes, but a pop-up message appeared on the screen: &#39;Character change finalizing.&#39; No…no! Jeff muttered, frantically clicking on the &#39;undo&#39; button. But it was too late. The changes had been locked in and the program wasn’t responding. Sarah finished off her chicken and milk, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. She let out a loud belch before turning to Jeff with a grin. “Man, that was fuckin’ good!” she said, flexing her muscles again.  “Now I&#39;m ready to pump some iron!”  Jeff could only stare in shock as Sarah left the room to get ready, leaving him alone with his thoughts.</p>
