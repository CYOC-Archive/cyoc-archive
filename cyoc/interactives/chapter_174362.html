<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt toyed with various notions, until he came up with an interesting idea. When he was at the gym, he would always glance at the guys walking around after their showers, with a towel wrapped tightly around their midsection. <br />
<br />
He imputed the settings into the chronovac, setting his new form as an unmarked white towel, to be located for use at his local gym. He sat back in his chair for a moment, with butterflies in his stomach. Hesitantly, he clicked “go.” <br />
<br />
He immediately started to feel a very pleasant warm sensation, which started in his crotch and moved all thought his body. Matt got up, and walked over to his full length mirror. He was feeling very warm now, the feeling was incredibly pleasurable. Almost without thinking he began to peel off his clothes, throwing them across the room. Standing naked, he watched himself start to change.<br />
<br />
His hair had started to recede into his head, and as Matt watched, all the light hairs on his body began to sink into his warm skin. Absentmindedly Matt started to rub his dick, sending more waves of pleasure through his body. His ass began to feel slightly numb, and as he turned around he felt his hole slowly seal up, and his cheeks began to deflate slightly. He looked down, and saw his toenails sinking into the flesh of his toes, which were merging together and retracting into his feet. He held his hands up. The fingernails were gone too, and his fingers had begun to sink into his hands. Looking up at his face, he gasped as his ears were pulling into his head and his mouth started to seal. In any other circumstance, Matt would have been horrified to see this, but for some reason as he lost his features, he felt only a growing warmth and pleasure. <br />
<br />
His nose began to seal next. Matt closed his eyes, and found that he couldn’t open them any more. But this was fine, because his other senses were growing. Matt laid down on the floor as his feet and hands retracted into his legs and arms. He pondered whether he should be afraid, but decided against it. This felt too nice. And the thought of being able to wrap his body around one of the guys at the gym was too enticing. Matt found that even as his sight had disappeared, he no longer needed it. He could feel the fibres of his carpet with a greater ability than he had had before. He was starting to be able to taste the dryness of it through his back. He was now able to taste, touch and smell through his entire body. He could taste the sweat his body was emitting as the warmth continued, feeling it soak into the carpet.<br />
<br />
Matt was unable to see what happened next, but he felt it as his entire body began to stretch out from all sides. His back was slowly ungulating across the carpet, thinning as it stretched, losing its human shape. He could feel every part of his body sinking as if being gently pulled towards the ground. His cock, which he had been rubbing with his atrophied hands, and later his arms, gently bent and followed the rest of his body. It touched the carpet, and then began to stretch and grow along with the rest of his body as it slowly lost dimension. This new sensation amped the pleasure up to a new degree. Matt came, gently expelling semen onto the carpet that his body then slowly rolled over. <br />
<br />
The width of Matt’s body had decreased by half, no longer resembling a human, but was still flesh. This began to change. Matt began to lighten, as the furthest extremities of his body began to shift into cotton. The cotton slowly made its way towards the centre of his body. Matt was now a mass of flesh, undulating in pleasure, in an island of cotton. The semen he had excreted began to soak into his cotton body. Matt could taste the salty sweetness, absorbing it greedily. His body continued to stretch outwards, as the cotton finally reached the centre of his body (his former chest). It sunk into the cotton fabric that had spread itself over the carpeted floor of Matt’s room.<br />
<br />
The warmth had stopped, replaced by an emptiness. Matt felt cold, but since he was no longer alive, this didn’t bother him so much as it made him realize he needed the warmth of a body to feel whole. As an object, he needed to be used to feel complete. The large mass of light cotton fabric began to shudder, and constrict on itself. As it did, waves of pleasure again shot through Matt’s body, as his individual fibres grew and gently swept across the rough carpet. Shrinking into the size of an average cotton towel, Matt didn’t realize that his room was fading, twitching out from existence. It was replaced by the locker room at the gym. <br />
<br />
Matt was draped along one of the benches, tasting the wood that over time had absorbed the sweat and fluids from the bodies of the men who worked out there. The air smelled of body odour and sweat, which was tantalizing to Matt. He wanted more than anything to be used himself, and to fulfill the function of the towel he had become. He didn’t have to wait long.</p>
