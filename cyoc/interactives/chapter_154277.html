<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday was a rather quiet day for Eric. There was still a lot of background noise that related to concerns over the this proposed reveal, but much of that remained fairly quiet or at least away from his notice. Nothing of that nature seemed to come into play at the breakfast table as he enjoyed good breakfast with the Stovalls, though it was rather obvious that his eyes were focused more on Julie. Her long blond hair with its slight curls framed her face perfectly, her blue eyes sparkled like perfect blue gemstones, and with his own weremer eyes, Eric could see the glowing aura around her, that showed her to be his &quot;one true love.&quot; It was something that simply made him smile. It was something that couldn&#39;t be missed by Martin and Melissa Stovall. The knowing glances to each other from Julie&#39;s parents was either missed or ignored by the younger two.<br />
<br />
From there, much of the two moved on some of the other plans for the day. They weren&#39;t too intensive, as the pair had finished much of their homework and while there were plenty of things that teenage minds could drift to, there was some intent to stay out of trouble and not create any real scene that might draw attention. Particularly with the knowledge that the whole reveal issue in the background would have its own problems that would likely draw some negative attention on him and Julie, even if they played no role in it. There were some things that Eric remembered from events in Minnesota that showed that kind of thing, and thus with a fairly quiet day... Eric was largely content to leave things at that and the settled into watching one of Julie&#39;s DVDs in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more fantasy than science fiction,&quot; Julie said in warning as she hit the close button on the DVD player, &quot;Just for warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What it is really doesn&#39;t matter... so long as it&#39;s with you,&quot; Eric smiled to her and was delighted to see her smile back.<br />
<br />
She collected the DVD remote and moved to sit beside him on the couch. The two calmly scooted together as the DVD&#39;s ads started, leading to Julie raising one arm and clicking down on the &quot;menu&quot; button with her thumb. She heard her father&#39;s phone ring in his office, and assumed that would probably be more of the same from the previous day and privately sighed, before hitting the &quot;enter&quot; button to play the movie, and at least for a little while put some of the things related to the reveal behind them.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;There... finished,&quot; Nate sighed as he set down the notepad that he&#39;d been writing on, while the sounds of the week&#39;s NFL game on Fox was on in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see?&quot; Alex asked from the spot beside Nate on the floor with his back resting against the couch behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Nate nodded and passed the notepad over to his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
With the day being quiet and his parents working together with Martha&#39;s education material she&#39;d need to brush up on to retake the Praxis for Washington State, Nate had ultimately spent the day with Alex. This included watching through the NFL games on Sunday, as it was something that Alex and his father enjoyed, but it gave Nate the time to look a few things over and brainstorm on some ideas, largely thinking over ideas that his parents had given him... to teach and write. It wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad plan and the latter could work out with regard to the period between school years for the former. He pivoted and handed the notepad on which he&#39;d been writing some ideas down on to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mostly just some initial ideas that I&#39;ve been thinking over,&quot; Nate commented as he passed the notepad over, &quot;nothing set in stone or detailed at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded and looked over a few things. There wasn&#39;t to much in the way of detail, as Nate had said but it did sort of touch on a few things that Alex recognized. The listed names and locations were different from what had happened in reality, but Alex could see some clear similarities to things that had actually happened. A family moving to a remote and largely uninhabited area to escape from internal and external pressures that came with city life only to find that the new town presented new challenges and new opportunities.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of these ideas kinda remind me of what you and your family went through coming here,&quot; Alex commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes real life presents good ideas,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;I mean... everyone likes new beginnings. And that&#39;s sorta what we had. Becoming weres helped accelerate the healing in my mom and dad&#39;s relationship... gave me the chance to experience things I&#39;d only daydreamed about, and actually helped Eric open up. There were obvious challenges to overcome... but that made for a good story as the &quot;new start&quot; was reached.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be putting too many details in this story would you?&quot; Mr. Ramsey asked from the couch as he looked down to the two High School Juniors, &quot;Given things... that might not be a good idea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mostly just loose ideas right now,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;nothing that directly relates to weres of the reveal. And even if it does... it would be more as fantasy than anything else and would paint weres in a good light.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand the sentiment,&quot; Mr. Ramsey spoke, &quot;but if this reveal goes forward... fantasy and weres will go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though if the reaction is positive... it going away might not be a bad thing,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;I mean... part of what&#39;s fed some of the folklore and Hollywood narratives in recent years with regard to were behavior have been with weres trying to keep things so unbelievable and often contradicting things that no one would believe we&#39;re real... but if the reveal happens and people believe it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hollywood would be the first source,&quot; Mr. Ramsey gave a frustrated sigh, &quot;right now... all the more reason NOT to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate decided not to comment on it. To a certain extent he agreed, but for the moment he was more nervous than anything else on the issue. Thus he didn&#39;t want to get too deep into the issue and risk some other problems that might come from getting too involved on things. As he accepted the notepad back from Alex, he glanced over to the television and noted that the game had ended and Fox was moving over to their post game coverage. He gave a sigh and looked over to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should be getting back,&quot; Nate said slowly, &quot;it is a school night and my folks will be expecting me for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Alex said with a nod, &quot;at least we got a quiet day together to see the best team in the league.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the Vikings weren&#39;t on...&quot; Nate countered, hoping for a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep laughing, handsome,&quot; Alex teased back, &quot;you&#39;ll need it when practices resume for the Thanksgiving Day game.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s starting to get a bit late...&quot; Eric said with a small sigh as the credits on the movie that he and Julie had been watching moved upward across the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could always stay...&quot; Julie offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents will expect me to be back... it is a school night, tonight,&quot; Eric reminded her.<br />
<br />
The two slowly stood up and nodded as the recognized that truth. They walked back through the living room and through the door to the kitchen and then back out to backyard/pool area and the cabana that was beside it. While Washington State, even in the mountains was a bit warmer than Minnesota was, Eric could feel some drop in the temperatures and that winter was arriving. It wasn&#39;t freezing yet, but it was definitely cooler than it was before Halloween. He made for a quick dash to the cabana, where Eric found his backpack, jacket and some of the other amenities that he&#39;d carried with him the previous Friday at the start of the weekend. The area was clean, as the pair had made sure to clean it up when they got up for breakfast, but Eric had left his bag and things in the small area when they went in for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are starting to get cooler,&quot; Eric noted as he be bent over to pick up his book back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;ll mean staying inside when the snow flies and the cabana will be locked up to keep it clean,&quot; Julie nodded, &quot;though... I wish you could stay...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too... but we&#39;ll still have school and right now with everything else that&#39;s going on, the last thing either of our parents need to worry about whether or not we&#39;re following curfews and dinner time rules,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;and it won&#39;t be too long before we get through high school and then college... get married...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then happily ever after,&quot; Julie smiled with a wistful tone in her voice.<br />
<br />
The two smiled at that, as Eric thought on the prophecy dreams he&#39;d had, with him and Julie happily together with two children of their own. It was one of those things that was odd to his scientific mind regarding all the things that made Moon Lake special, but at the same time it also had some assurance to him that he and Julie would be okay and that they would be happy. It might mean waiting and it might mean hurdling some things given what was presently going on in the background. But as the two shared a romantic kiss before Eric departed to return home, both shared some sense of personal optimism for the future.</p>
