<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac looked at the coin on Eric’s nightstand and hastily picked it up. “I wish me and Eric were back in our old bodies.”<br />
<br />
The coin didn’t do anything, Eric’s second-to-last wish still in effect. Isaac let out an annoyed sigh. He knew what was going to happen but still wanted to attempt it just in case it worked. But it didn’t and now he was on the road back to middle school.<br />
<br />
“Well, I might as well get ready,” Isaac told himself as he rummaged through Eric’s closet and dresser for something to wear. He picked a plain blue shirt and some khaki shorts to wear, along with an old pair of tennis shoes. They would’ve originally appeared incredibly small to Isaac but in his new perspective they looked like a perfect fit.<br />
<br />
Isaac took off Eric’s pajama shirt first, revealing a smooth lanky chest and stomach that contained a small layer of baby fat. Then he pulled down his pants and was met with two thin hairless legs and a narrow waist, a pair of white briefs as his undergarments.<br />
<br />
Isaac’s face flashed red as he observed his underdeveloped body in shame. It was rather different that his own. No body hair, no muscle, nothing that showed signs of maturity that his own adult figure had. Isaac attempted to flex his biceps and frowned as nothing protruded from his arms, a clear lack of muscle mass. This was definitely a boy’s body, not a man’s.<br />
<br />
Isaac glanced at the white briefs he now wore and wondered what laid beneath them. He grabbed the waistband of the underwear before stopping himself. Should he even look? It felt wrong to examine his son’s body without permission, yet, he would have to see it sooner or later either during a trip to the bathroom or to take a shower. It was probably better to get it over with now.<br />
<br />
Isaac pulled the briefs down as he viewed his new member, the small thin dick hanging sadly. It was barely two inches and was devoid of any pubic hair, the entire area as smooth as the rest of his adolescent body. Isaac touched his scrotum and noticed how odd his balls felt. It seemed that Eric had barely even begun puberty, his balls hadn’t dropped and were still left in their prepubescent state not to mention how underdeveloped his whole body was, no signs of puberty to be seen.<br />
<br />
Isaac put his underwear back in place as he changed quickly, embarrassed at his pathetic young body. Once he finished, he brushed his teeth and brushed his hair. Or at least attempted to as his hair was impossible to brush, consisting of blonde locks of curly hair that refused to get into place like his old hair would. Observing his reflection, Isaac noticed how much different Eric looked compared to him. He had pale skin, clear blue eyes, and curly blonde hair. Traits inherited from his late wife. Isaac’s original body on the other hand followed the tall, dark, and handsome archetype with tanned skin, dark brown eyes, and straight black hair. A complete contrast to Eric’s.<br />
<br />
After he felt he was about done, Isaac grabbed Eric’s backpack from under the bed and made his way down the stairs and to the front door. Eric was already there waiting for him, dressed in a suit and holding the car keys in his left hand. Isaac looked at his old body in amazement. He never realized how tight his suits were, the fabric straining as they constrained the muscles on his old body. Was that how he looked at the office? No wonder he was always getting so many stares. Instead of feeling embarrassed, Isaac felt proud. As a bodybuilder, Isaac took deep pride in displaying his muscles. However, it also made being stuck in Eric’s body even more humiliating, the weak body barely having any muscle mass.<br />
<br />
“We better hurry, don’t want to be late for school,” Eric gave Isaac a wink before opening the front door and making his way to the car. Isaac only followed in annoyance, apprehensively watching Eric adjust himself in the drivers seat as he sat in the passenger seat.<br />
<br />
“So… Dad. You’re Isiash, right?”<br />
<br />
Eric looked at Isaac with a confused expression. “Of course! Who else would I be?”<br />
<br />
“Just checking,” Isaac said with a sigh of relief. He assumed that when Eric had made his most recent wish that the coin had caused Eric into believing he was Isaac, fully copying Isaac’s personality. Seeing Eric acting and talking as he usually would confirmed Isaac’s assumptions, making him feel more relieved that a duplicate of himself would be heading to his job and not Eric himself. Eric then backed out of the driveway and made his way on to the road, heading in the direction of Eric’s school. After a few minutes they were parked in front of a middle school, countless kids entering the building.<br />
<br />
“Have a good day at school, son!” Eric said as Isaac exited the car, giving him a thumbs up. Isaac gave a weak smile in response as Eric drove away, heading to Isaac’s old workplace and old job as an accountant.<br />
<br />
Isaac could do nothing else but watch Eric leave and accept his new role as a middle schooler. He started to make his way to the school building, worried about being late for his son’s first class.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I’m in fucking middle school again,” Isaac grumbled to himself as he walked through the school doors and browsed the halls, attempting to find his homeroom. He dug inside Eric’s backpack and found a sheet of paper that listed Eric’s class schedule. Each class had their respective subject, teacher, and room number stated, but it didn’t help Isaac much. He was still having a hard time finding the proper classroom since it was his first time navigating this school.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I should’ve went to parent teacher night,” Isaac though as stopped walking and examined the class schedule again. The early bell then rang, letting all students know only five minutes remained until the tardy bell rung. Isaac couldn’t care less. He was more preoccupied in finding his homeroom than getting a tardy slip.<br />
<br />
“Outta the way, shrimp!” A tall boy pushed Isaac to the side as he walked into the classroom Isaac was currently standing in front of, annoyed that he had been blocking the entrance.<br />
<br />
“Asshole!” Issac thought to himself before noticing how tall the kids around him appeared to be as they raced through the halls. Eric stood at a height of five feet even, not having hit his growth spurt yet, and was rather short for a 7th grader. It didn’t help that Eric had a late birthday and was younger than his peers, his adolescent body further inhibited by the fact that he was a late bloomer.<br />
<br />
Isaac himself had been older than the majority of his classmates and an early bloomer. He was already tall by the time he had left elementary school, towering over most of his classmates for his entire school life. This made it relatively easy to not be susceptible to bullying. However, it appeared that Eric’s body wouldn’t have the same luck, his shorter stature making him an easier target to bullies.<br />
<br />
Eventually Isaac found his homeroom and made his way to an empty desk, the tardy bell ringing as soon as he sat down. “Cutting it close, aren’t you Eric?” the teacher said. He was a man in his early thirties and wore a serious look on his face. It seemed that he wasn’t the biggest fan of Eric. Isaac only let out an annoyed groan internally, he was stuck in middle school in the underdeveloped body of his son, it was going to be a long day.</p>
