<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael Lee woke up at around 5:30 AM. He was a senior at Otter Falls High school. He was Varsity Football and he had decent grades; all around, a<br />
  pretty good guy. He was sort of the all American male stereotype, famous back in the 1950s. Though he was a bit of a bully, he couldn’t help it really; peer<br />
  pressure and all that. He mainly did this when he was around the rest of his buddies. He got away with a lot of it too, thanks to his being such a<br />
  phenomenal player and decent student. <br />
  Michael was home alone his parents were rich and busy people who had ostensibly moved to this tiny town to keep Michael away form bad influences in<br />
  reality they had moved so they could pay fewer taxes. They worked in the city and mostly came home only a few days a week. Michael had essentially<br />
  since the age of ten taken care of himself; though his parents had hired a ‘nanny’ to watch him for the days they knew they would be completely absent.<br />
  Leaving a ten year old alone was irresponsible and illegal. At sixteen, they judged he was capable of being on his own and dropped the ‘nanny’. After<br />
  that, the neighbor, Mr. Schroeder agreed to look in on Michael from time to time. Mike liked the older retired man, when he had a problem Mr. Schroeder<br />
  was always a sympathetic ear and he often appealed to Michael’s better nature when it came to his being a bully. He was like a grandfather and Michael<br />
  respected him. His parents didn’t ignore him really it was more they were just excessively busy. <br />
  Michael went over to the back door and let his large Rottweiler Bix out. Bix had been his dog since he was a puppy. He had gotten him five years ago and<br />
  had cared for the dog very well. He had gotten him on a bet with his Dad that he could to be responsible. He had won that one too.<br />
  Bix ran around the fenced back yard and Michael took the time to pour the dog his breakfast and a large bowl of water form the tap. Then he let Bix back<br />
  inside. Petting the dog on the head he went over and got a glass of water for himself he was still thirsty after last night’s pizza. He took a big gulp and<br />
  then sputtered.<br />
  “Bix!” He said and the dog looked up at him surprised. Then after seeing that Michael was not paying attention to him he went back to eating. Michael<br />
  meanwhile tried spitting out dog hair. Somehow the glass had dog hair in it and he had swallowed some with his water. That dog had a shedding problem<br />
  but he never seemed to run out of hair. Michael knew he would have to sweep the house before his parents came home, but they wouldn’t be back for<br />
  another two days.<br />
  Michael went back to making breakfast for himself. Out of necessity he had learned to cook and he was pretty good at it. He could even make a pretty<br />
  good roast, it was simple enough to put the roast in foil with some spices and vegetables and pop it in the oven for a couple of hours. His father didn’t<br />
  want to hear such things. His father believed in a hyper masculine ideal for his son and he didn’t want Michael acting ‘fruity’ in anyway.<br />
  Little did his father know that Michael was gay. Michael hadn’t slept with anyone and hadn’t come out to anyone, but he knew he was. This<br />
  was another reason for the bullying, to make sure no one suspected. He thought it would be best if he kept that secret form his homophobic friends and<br />
  his dad and possibly his mom. Right now he never wanted to come out. <br />
  But back to more important matters; he set out food on the counter and was busily cooking when he felt slightly odd; a little itchy and a brief wave of<br />
  dizziness and nausea that made him wonder if he was coming down with the flu. He passed it by in his brain and started, making some scrambled eggs.<br />
  Little did Michael know that the water he had just drunk was connected to a pipeline that was connected to the filtering and purification plant that drew<br />
  from the river.<br />
  It was a state of the art purification system, it used oxygen to kill off bacteria, charcoal filtration to improve taste and reverse osmosis filters to remove<br />
  micro particulates and bacteria. The water was treated with only enough chlorine to meet state and federal standards because the town wanted to have<br />
  ‘pure natural’ water. The chlorine ensured that most viruses would not be transmitted. The animorph virus was not ‘most viruses’. It would take the<br />
  chlorination levels of a swimming pool to kill it off in water. Michael had no idea that he was now infected with the virus. Not all the pipes in town were<br />
  infected, but a good number of them were.<br />
  Michael shook off the odd feeling and, indeed, it seemed to have passed on it’s own. He went to the door as in any second he knew it would…*DING<br />
  DONG* ...ring. <br />
  Michael opened the door to his smiling friend Isaac Ferris. Isaac was a bit smaller then Michael with black flowing full bodied hair. He was a charming guy<br />
  who broke the hearts of a lot of women as he walked by and some men. Michael had entertained a crush for Isaac for awhile, heck it was how he knew he<br />
  was gay. Well, that and that time he tired to sleep with his girl friend Linda. But he knew Isaac was straight and they were just friends. Isaac stepped<br />
  inside and immediately asked. “So what’s for grub?” <br />
  Michael had let it slip that he could cook and after the obligatory mockery and jokes they had tried his food and discovered he was good at it. Isaac had<br />
  discovered that Michael was better a better cook than his own mother; Isaac said she had once burned cold cereal, a comic exaggeration, but not too far<br />
  from the truth. Isaac always made excuses to be at Michael’s when Michael was cooking.<br />
  “What no, ‘Good morning, Mike.’?” said Michael sarcastically. He didn’t mind he took his friend’s informality as a compliment.<br />
  “Food, then pleasantries.” said Isaac.<br />
  “Right this way greedy gut!” said Michael.<br />
  As they walked in Bix bounded into the room and immediately started humping Isaac’s leg.<br />
  “BIX! BAD DOG!” said Michael grabbing the dog’s collar and leading the horny mutt, over to a study room where Bix’s bed was and locked him in. Bix<br />
  was horny from the virus with which, unknowingly, Michael had also been infected. <br />
  “Sorry about that man.” said Michael apologetically.<br />
  “No worries buddy. I’ll take it as a weird compliment.” said Isaac coming into the kitchen. “Again I ask, what’s for eats.”<br />
  “Nothing fancy, just some scrambled eggs and toast.” said Michael as he finished doling out the eggs.<br />
  “Hey these eggs are great,” Said Isaac happily as he began chowing down, “by the way, nice look with the beard. You have no idea how jealous I am of<br />
  an eighteen year old guy who can grow a beard after going without shaving for one day.”<br />
  Michael was perplexed by this; he had just shaved this morning. He felt his cheeks and chin and went to the bathroom to check it out; perhaps he’d just<br />
  thought he’d shaved this morning. When he got to the bathroom he saw a nice growth of stubble, about three days worth for Michael. That was so<br />
  weird; his dad didn’t grown hair that fast! He knew he had shaved yesterday. He checked his razor, just to be sure, and it still had fresh traces of shaving<br />
  cream and a few whiskers from this morning. “What’s going on!” he thought and ran his hand over his beard again. <br />
  Isaac called out as he was coming down the hall, “Hey Mike, is there something wrong?” Just then, Michael was beginning to feel a little warm and his<br />
  cock was starting to get his attention.</p>
