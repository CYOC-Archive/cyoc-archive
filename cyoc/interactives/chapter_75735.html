<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The 18 year old Jake picked up the dark grey, almost black, hoodie that lay strewn across one of the many piles of clothes that adorned the stores <br />
shelves. With his hoodie in hand, Jake walked briskly into one of the Change Rooms, locking the door behind him. The room was surprisingly large <br />
for a fitting room, a large walled mirror adorning the back wall, a red chair sitting in the corner to the left. Jake slipped his arms through the <br />
sleeves of the hoodie and flung it around his back.<br />
<br />
Jake could see from his reflection that his clothes didn't suit the dark colour of the hoodie, not to mention that the sleeves and body were too <br />
long, not so long that he would yet pass up on the free piece of clothing, but significantly so. He could clearly see that his t-shirt didn't match the <br />
hoodie, he also felt an unusual urge to try it on shirtless, something he would never normally do. &quot;Whats the harm?&quot; he thought to himself. He <br />
removed his top and slipped the hoodie back on to his thin, shirtless body.<br />
<br />
Jake's skin started to tingle slightly where the hoodie brushed against it, he put it to the back of his mind, passing it off as being left over washing <br />
powder or some kind of dust that could be washed out of the fabric. Quite suddenly, Jake felt uncomfortable. He tried to remove his arm from the <br />
sleeve but it wouldn't budge, as if it were stuck to him with an invisible glue. He tugged at it harder and harder to no avail.<br />
<br />
Only seconds later he felt a rush of heat run through the hoodie and into his body. He breathed heavily as the heat gushed through his blood to <br />
every part of his body. Pacing around the room did nothing to quell it, even the air against his exposed chest did nothing. The heat soon began to <br />
be followed by strange sensations throughout his body; the DNA in his cells being filled with energy, rearranging, changing him into a completely <br />
different man.<br />
<br />
Jake grunted as his scalp felt as if it were electrified, he watched in the mirror with an expression of intense fear on his face as the hair on his <br />
head began receding into his scalp. He frantically grabbed at it with his hands in a futile attempt to stop it shortening, &quot;No, no, no!&quot; he yelled. The <br />
hair shrank back, leaving him with a very short cut no longer than 1/4 inch long. The hair on his chest was struck with the same sensation, Jake <br />
watched as the hair completely receded away, leaving his chest bare.<br />
<br />
Trembling in fear he watched as his already light skin tone became even lighter tone all over. He groaned in pain as his spine stretched out <br />
slightly longer, the bones in his legs cracking and growing longer as well, his arms mirroring this as they lengthened to suit his new height. With <br />
his 5'11&quot; frame now a solid 6'1&quot;, the growth stopped and the energy moved elsewhere.<br />
<br />
He continued to tremble, grunting as his hands began to ache and heat up. He held up his open palms to his face, watching in fear and pain as his <br />
average hands cracked and expanded, growing longer and wider. His slender fingers growing longer and thicker, his knuckles strengthening and <br />
his nails reshaping, his palms also expanded out wider and longer; leaving him with a set of large, well-shaped hands.<br />
<br />
Jake's eyes were stretched wide in horror as he watched and felt the changes occurring to his body. Heat filled his forearms as he felt muscles shift <br />
and grow under the hoodie's sleeves. He could feel power being pumped into them, his forearms expanding with muscle. He flexed involuntarily <br />
as his upper arms were wracked with sudden agony and heat, instantly dulling to an ache as his biceps and triceps exploded with new muscle and <br />
strength. He could see the sleeves of the hoodie being filled out by his growing arms. His shoulders were no exception, cracking and creaking, <br />
growing larger, wider and stronger. His felt the power creep up his back as it cramped, his lats flaring and pulsing with newfound strength. His <br />
weak arms had become strong and lean, well-defined and athletic.<br />
<br />
He gasped as a short burst of pain ran through his abdomen, more bones reforming in preparation for changes to come; his rib cage expanding <br />
slightly, his collar bone and shoulders thickening. A sensation of pushing and pulling formed in his chest. He watched in the mirror as abs began <br />
to appear on his previously thin, flat stomach. With each cramp the muscles became thicker and more visible, leaving him with a tight, lean six-<br />
pack. His pecs began to follow suit, muscle pushing out of the once bony frame, two light, but well defined pecs making themselves visible.<br />
<br />
His neck tightened as it too strengthened and thickened ever so slightly. The strange power moved downwards. His legs cramped as his thighs <br />
began to swell and expand, the new tightness and power of the muscle growing within them overwhelming him, almost causing him to lose his <br />
balance. He grabbed his thighs with his new big hands, desperately trying to stop the changes somehow. His long, thick fingers were being <br />
pushed apart as the muscle in his thighs expanded against his wishes. The legs of his shorts were now tight against his thick legs. His ass also <br />
strengthened and rounded, becoming firm and tight, pressing erotically against his tight shorts. His calves rapidly followed as they grew thicker <br />
and larger, giving him strong, energetic legs. The now too-tight khaki shorts that adorned his legs reformed, loosening and lightening as they <br />
grew down his legs to his ankles; morphing into a black pair of tracksuit pants, white stripes formed down the side as a logo emblazoned itself <br />
above them.<br />
<br />
The intense heat flew down through Jake's legs into his feet. He clenched his jaw as he felt his feet ache and burn, the toes on his perfectly <br />
average size 10 feet popping and cracking as the bones began growing longer and thicker, his soles doing the same. In only moments his toes <br />
were pressing against the ends of his shoes, but the growth did not cease, the pressure becoming more intense. His feet were growing longer, <br />
wider and thicker, suddenly the pressure began to ease; his shoes began reshaping as they too began growing longer and wider, changing style. <br />
His once normal feet continued their expansion, his toes becoming long and thick to match the growing and expanding soles as his shoes <br />
morphed into big white Nike trainers. His new enormous size 16 feet felt at home in the new shoes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the energy rushed into Jake's face. He clenched his teeth tight as his felt his jaw bone grow thicker and squarer. His cheekbones changed <br />
shape, clicking and popping, making his face slightly wider, rounder and more defined. His nose shifted and changed shape, rounding at the tip <br />
slightly, becoming a bit wider. His eyes suddenly stung, he shut them tightly as they changed colour from blue to a bright green. He clutched at <br />
his throat as he felt his vocal chords thicken and change shape, his adams apple becoming more prominent. His completely smooth, hairless face <br />
felt as if it were being pricked by pins as recently shaven stubble formed across his jaw. Looking in the mirror Jake saw the reflection of a <br />
stranger, an incredibly attractive, rugged stranger. He couldn't believe that it was him. Jake could tell he was a now a few years older, in his early <br />
twenties. &quot;What's happening to me?!&quot; he managed to moan quietly, noticing his voice was now much deeper.<br />
<br />
Jake immediately knew what was next, &quot;Please no!&quot; he hoarsely tried to yell. He pulled his new trackies to his knees anticipating the next part. His <br />
crotch filled with heat, his testicles burning as he felt and watched them expand and grow, larger and larger. He felt them tingle and quiver as <br />
they began rapidly producing new man-milk and hormones. Suddenly, his cock stood to attention, becoming harder than he had ever felt it <br />
before, jutting up towards his lean stomach. His typical 6 incher stood at full mast, throbbing and screaming for release. The twitching member <br />
began to ache, &quot;No, help, stop it, pl---&quot; Jake tried to yell, managing only a hoarse whisper. His aching cock began lengthening and thickening with <br />
each heartbeat. Every pulse of blood to his cock causing it to inch further and further out. The shaft thickened and expanded, veins growing and <br />
snaking their way across the growing pole. The head flared out larger and larger, his foreskin aching as the enormous bulb stretched it. Jake <br />
watched on terrified as an invisible force pulled the foreskin back, the skin slowly slipped behind the enormous mushroom head. &quot;Fuck, what's it <br />
doing to do?!&quot; he yelled in his mind, giving up on any attempt to speak. Then in a flash of pain he gasped, shutting his eyes tight, slowly opening <br />
them to see a gargantuan 11 inch circumcised cock; his foreskin gone, revealing the enormous throbbing head.<br />
<br />
The heat that had ran through his body now washed away almost instantly, a slight tingle remaining, moving into his head. Jake shut his eyes once <br />
more as he felt his mind fog. New thoughts and personality filled his brain. Then, it was over.<br />
<br />
Jake slowly opened his eyes, looking directly in the mirror ahead of him. The old Jake was no more. He smirked with a cheeky grin, admiring his <br />
new sexy, chav body. He moved his large hands onto his enormous cut cock. He wrapped his long fingers around his thick shaft and pumped up <br />
and down furiously, his exposed head incredibly sensitive to his touch. Panting and grunting in pleasure he yelled out as he blasted an enormous <br />
load of thick cream all over the mirror. His lean chest tensed up, along with the rest of his new body, his long toes curled in his shoes; the orgasm <br />
continuing on and on; more and more cum, the final remnants of his old self, spewing out of his enormous cock. &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; he yelled in his new <br />
deep north London accent. Finally the pleasure ceased.<br />
<br />
One of the new thoughts in the back of his head seemed to be 'louder' than the others, telling him that because the hoodie had changed him, he <br />
now had the ability to change others. He thought silently for a moment, &quot;How?...&quot; he felt his balls churn, filling with his brand new seed, then he <br />
realised - &quot;That's how!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jake smirked and walked out of the room, deciding to...</p>
