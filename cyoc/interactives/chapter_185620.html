<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…and I think, cause you are his sister and have to bear him every day, you should be the one that gets her revenge first.<br />
<br />
„Oh, thanks sis, I appreciate it. – Kyle? Kiss my feet.”<br />
<br />
And with that Kyle dove to the ground and begun passionately and delighted to kiss his sister’s feet as if she just saved his life, or being a goddess that brought him eternal light.<br />
<br />
“Wow, he does it. But why is he looking so joyfully while doing it?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know. I would also prefer if it felt more like a punishment for him. I made him automatically do everything I command but I didn’t wanted him do to behave like a robot; as if his body was remote controlled. I want that he does these things lively, with passion, like he means it. So I said that he will do these things because as soon as I order him it will become his own desire to do so.” Megan looked inquiring at Jennifer whether she had a better idea. But then she spoke further “Speaking of which. I don’t wanted it to get boring or to feel remorse when I punish him, so I decided to alter myself to have no pity or compassion towards Kyle when I mistreat him. Maybe I should do something like this to you too, but I didn’t need the curse for that.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I think that would be a good idea. Oh and, could you please give me my own legs back?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course, sorry, I totally forgot about them, you know, because of his silly spell sense no difference, or know which legs the people are supposed to have.”<br />
<br />
*Snap*<br />
<br />
And with that Jennifer finally got her own legs back and now also could punish Kyle for hours and feel absolutely no regret. ‘Just like this little fucker never felt when he humiliated me’ Jennifer thought. While all of this Kyle was still devotedly kissing his sisters bare feet.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt absolutely no pity for him, instead, now that she thought about it, she had a brilliant idea how to solve their problem.<br />
<br />
“Megan! I’ve got it. Why don’t we alter your brothers personality in a bit more, let’s say, <em>alternative </em> way?”<br />
<br />
“Do tell!”<br />
<br />
“We could give him something like a split personality, with the difference that sometimes both are present at the same time. You could say like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But with the alteration that his Hyde-personality is one that is absolutely devoted to you and submissively carries out every order you give him. He will serve you in a subservient, humble but passionate way. As soon as you give him a command Mr. Hyde takes over and controls Kyles body but with Kyle still being aware of everything, he can think like the old Kyle did, but is unable to move against his bodies behavior.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh, that is a wonderful idea. But I think I will improve it in one, maybe two things. He will also behave like this if you give him an order, and something special in addition.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Megan, that is so nice of you. And what would that be?”<br />
<br />
“No worry sis, I love to do that for my friends, and for the other adjustment, just wait a few moments, but believe me it will be fun. So, now to you Kyle. Stop kissing for now and… –“<br />
<br />
*Snap*<br />
<br />
Kyle stood up and as he was on his feet again it seemed to him like an airwave just went through him. However, afterwards he couldn’t tell any difference. He hadn’t heard what Jennifer and his sister were talking about, because he was too focused on worshipping his sister’s feet the way they deserved to be treated, well at least it felt like this at that particular moment.<br />
<br />
Both girls were now grinning at him in anticipation, when Megan broke the stalemate at first, Kyle got an unpleasant feeling inside about what would come next.<br />
<br />
With another snap they all in a blink of an eye stood in the living room. Megan strut cross the room to section with some open space and with a casual snap summoned a red, cozy armchair with noble adornments, making it look like a throne. She sat down with a grin and lifted her right, bare foot.<br />
<br />
“Kyle, lick my feet clean from the dust.”<br />
<br />
Kyle looked at her, but nothing happened. It seemed like she took the curse away from him and he was free to choose again if he wanted to obey or not. Of course she still expected him to obey, her demanding but happy expression let no doubt about that, but this was gross, he would never do that. So he just shook his head. <br />
<br />
Contrary to his assumption, she was not upset by this. She smiled as if she had anticipated his response and undeterred spoke again.<br />
<br />
“How ‘bout you Jack? Would you be so kindly?”<br />
<br />
Before Kyle could turn his head to look who that Jack would be his legs already moved toward his sister and bend down to the knees just in front of his sister.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly a deep voice resounded in his head, laughing. ‘What who is there?’ “Don’t you heard what your marvelous sister said?! I am Jack, the better part of you, moron.” The voice had a little ounce of a devious, mean thug, very self-confident and assertive. The one thing though that was out of character was his near obsession towards his sister, in regard to her he was subservient and devoted. The fact that ‘Jack’ appeared out of nowhere and was easily capable of controlling his body scared Kyle the most. It was as if he was kicked out of the driver seat. However he could still experience everything like being on the passenger seat. He saw everything, he heard everything even felt everything his body experienced. But what mostly disgusted him was that he also smelled and tasted everything.<br />
<br />
While Kyles inner monologue, or more dialog since a few seconds, Jack had already moved their body closer to Megan’s feet and began to lick his sisters soles with smitten eagerness. Kyle could feel all the dust that was stuck at her soles and now was on his tongue after the first licks. He felt the urge to spit out but couldn’t do so, since Jack would never be that disrespectful towards any of his sisters orders, it seemed.<br />
<br />
“Come on Kyle, just enjoy it like I do.” Jacks voice again appeared and giving Kyle the nasty feeling that Jack also was capable of hearing his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Of course I can hear your thoughts Kyle, we share not only this body but also this mind, moron. And I must say that is a well-trained body you have here. A bit more training and it will be perfect to serve all of our sister’s needs.”<br />
‘No this has to stop, it must be temporarily… PLEASE! I can’t live like this!’ <br />
“But why not Kyle, look just how much we like it.”<br />
Then all of a sudden Kyle could her his own voice, but not inside his head, it was his mouth that gave out these words and Kyle hadn’t anything to do with that.<br />
<br />
“Your feet taste so amazing Megan, thank you so much for letting me worship you. I love my new place Princess Megan.”<br />
<br />
“Princess Megan? Hmm, I do like that. So you’re welcome <em>Kyle</em>.” she giggled when she poke his name.<br />
<br />
‘No! Stop that, I don’t wanna do that, it’s YOU!’<br />
<br />
But he was interrupted in his thoughts by his sister’s voice, but from the outside, fortunately.<br />
“And what is with you Kyle? Do you enjoy your new tasks?” his sister snickered.<br />
<br />
For a moment it was still, Kyle wasn’t sure what to do now. Was he able to speak? He gave it a try.<br />
<br />
“Megan? What have you done to me?-” but that was all he could say since his body movement interrupted him, going on giving his sister’s soles long, submissive licks.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, don’t like to hear that. But you will get used to it. – One day or another. But also maybe don’t.” she laughed, Jennifer joining her amusement.<br />
<br />
“But that isn’t-” *lick* (again interrupted) “-fair! I mean what did I do to- *lick* deserve this?”<br />
<br />
“Oh you know damn well about all the things you did. The little ones and the really evil, big schemes you did on me and Jennifer, and probably on many other girls as well. So you could say that finally the day of settlement had come. And I must say I really like how things had turned out. How ‘bout you <em>Jack</em>?”<br />
<br />
And with that Kyles ability to speak was gone again. But Jack went on for him “Oh I love it. It’s just what we deserve and I want to add that I would like to stay like this forever. Thank you so much Princess Megan for making us like this.”<br />
<br />
“Your welcome. Now I think you could go on with the other foot, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Princess. Whatever you like.”<br />
<br />
And with that the same procedure was done at her left foot. All Kyle could do was oblige and inwardly curse himself for his bad situation. That was not what he expected when he got the curse again earlier this evening, what already seemed to be far away from his new reality.<br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes more of cleaning his sister’s foot he was dismissed with a short “Enough, Kyle.”<br />
He stood up, but not until long. With a further snap, near to Megan’s ‘throne’, a new armchair had appeared. It was blue, despite of that looked all the same, and faced in his direction when he turned his head 90° to the right. After just a few seconds Jennifer had took place on it and was happily grinning at him.<br />
<br />
“Shall I let you command him or am I am allowed to order him as well?” Jennifer gazed at Megan.<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course, feel free to command him yourself. He is now your slave as well.”<br />
<br />
That word nearly made his stomach turn over. He never felt that helplessly any time before. In a few hours he was degraded to a lowly slave at his sister’s and her new friend Jennifer’s feet, literally!<br />
<br />
 “So Kyle, would you be so kind to take off my converse for me and give me a nice foot rub?”<br />
<br />
He was free to speak, even as it probably would only last for a few seconds, but he wasn’t ready to give in. “No Jennifer I would not. And I can’t believe that you are so cruel and let me do that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Kyle, you forget that you are addressing my feelings of guilt that no longer exists in regard to you. But I already thought that this would be hard for you. So I think I just ask someone else to do it. <em>Jack?</em>Would you be so nice and give me an enjoyable foot rub?”<br />
<br />
“Oh I would love to.” And again Kyles body fell to his knees.<br />
<br />
“You see moron? This is how it’s done. And I have to say. You are really missing out a lot of fun here. It’s WONDERFUL to obey these two girls, they are gorgeous and so loveable. Can’t believe that you let this opportunity go.” Jack laughed in his thoughts, but doubtlessly meant every word about Jennifer and Megan to be true. He would do anything for them. And that’s what Kyles body from now on would do. Proven by the fact that not 10 Inch further from his face his hands were already holding Jennifer’s right foot and attentively massaging every spot, only focusing on giving her pleasure. <br />
<br />
And Kyle was in the first row, unable to leave his seat or close his eyes from the movie. The most scary horror movie he had ever seen. And it only had begun.</p>
