<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Editor&#39;s Note: Michelle&#39;s POV<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You slowly followed after Head Sister Julie as she made her way over to the stairs that would take you out of the underground cavern that Frank and Julie had had carved out underneath their home. Selene and Michael followed closely behind you with Elizabeth behind them. Behind them were Jake and Emily, and all of you made up what would be Selene&#39;s sisterhood, assuming that Florencia somehow keeps her sisterhood and isn&#39;t killed in the next meeting. The moment was heavily focused on the possibility that you were pregnant, which was Julie&#39;s suspicion based on how fast you were adapting to being a siren and how much siren magic you were producing. It left you rather nervous as you felt you weren&#39;t ready to be a mother. Even with the fact that you had somehow created your male self out of nothing and were entirely the siren that Head Sister Florencia turned you into, you still remembered being male and being Michael and Selene&#39;s husband. As you began to climb the stairs those thoughts played into something that Selene had said earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to kick me out of the house?&quot; you asked to Selene, your voice nervous, &quot;Me and Elizabeth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle... you part of my sisterhood... if you wish to stay, I can&#39;t make you leave... unless you break the rules and case trouble,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;and even with that... as I said before... you and Michael are one and the same. You were one being when we married and when we conceived our daughter. You were one being when Florencia turned you into Michelle. You only pulled something no transformed siren has ever done but split herself between her human and siren identity... you&#39;re both still you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said you had men that Elizabeth and I would love and you wanted me to stay away from Michael,&quot; you answered, &quot;do you not want me around all the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Michelle... I was joking when I said that bit about knowing men you&#39;d love,&quot; Selene assured you, &quot;I&#39;d have to have been cheating on you to have any knowledge of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;d want me with you?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Selene answered and their her tone actually took on one that was rather seductive, &quot;and remember, Michelle... we&#39;re sirens. While our normal way of feeding means we&#39;re going to be attracted to men... our societies are generally all female. I mean... so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re also sexually attracted to females,&quot; you finished.<br />
<br />
And Selene moved close up behind you and you felt her hand grab your butt which made you squeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re very sexy, Michelle,&quot; Selene commented, &quot;in this... you not only restored the man I love but gave me something that gives me an even bigger gift... the man I married AND the siren version of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced over your shoulder to see Selene look over her shoulder to Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Emily... I don&#39;t know what Head Sister Julie has explained to you about all the ins and outs of being a siren, but this is all quite NORMAL for mermaids,&quot; Selene spoke, &quot;and within our sisterhoods... we&#39;re not typically known for one lover. Though this is also because typically sirens typically live in communal groups that are very close and traditionally haven&#39;t interacted with humans beyond feeding. So... don&#39;t be ashamed if you find yourself attracted to Michelle, Elizabeth, or myself. That is perfectly normal for sirens... and don&#39;t worry, if you don&#39;t WANT that attention, no mermaid would force it on a member of her sisterhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Council Member Sally explained to to me,&quot; Emily said slowly, &quot;you all... ARE beautiful... but I think I&#39;ll stick with Jake for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selene nodded and returned her attention to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about Michael...?&quot; you asked, &quot;You said we&#39;d have words if you caught me having sex with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve never thought you to be narcissistic in that you&#39;d be attracted to yourself and that you&#39;d want some freedom to date if you wanted to,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;if you find a man that you fall in love with... I won&#39;t stop you from loving him if that is your choice, Michelle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I love you, Selene,&quot; you said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could run basic DNA tests on both Michael and Michelle,&quot; Julie offered, &quot;they&#39;ll take longer than the pregnancy test for Michelle and will have to go into the hospital... but they could determine how close they actually are genetically?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t we be the same, being the same person?&quot; Michael wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of personality... you both probably are,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;but tell me, Michael, do any of your female ancestors have breasts as big as Michelle does or hips as wide as Michelle does?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no... though I can&#39;t tell you how big they were... but as Michelle... I figured I was at least a D cup if not a Double D cup...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I am bigger than mom,&quot; you commented, &quot;I don&#39;t know how you&#39;ll explain me to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can always be my sister,&quot; Selene offered, &quot;which you are...&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a weak smile to Selene and then looked back Julie as your small parade began to climb the stairs, &quot;but what does my bust line and its relation to my mother&#39;s bust line have to do with my genetics?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when siren magic is used to transform someone... particularly a human male... that their genetic structure changes as a result, and that can be striking,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;While you and Michael may have similar personalities and identical memories... but you may not be genetically related to each other...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to be having sex with my male form...&quot; you commented, &quot;I&#39;d just like to stay with Selene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can,&quot; Selene assured you.<br />
<br />
That did assure your mind that you wouldn&#39;t lose Selene, though the situation would now make for the oddest marriage ever. Selene had married a man, Michael. You were decidedly female, but knowing that Selene still loved you, even with your restoring Michael, made you feel better. Though it still didn&#39;t mean you felt ready to be a mother. Though that didn&#39;t stop the mission that were being lead on. Once you were lead up the stairs, Head Sister Julie lead you into a small interior room in the house. It wasn&#39;t too far from the stairs that lead to cavern grotto underneath. In the room, you could see all sorts of medical equipment and a computer, though the model was a year or two older than the ones you&#39;d seen when you&#39;d taken Selene for her appointments.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d you get all this?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly buying off older equipment when the hospital decides to upgrade to newer technology,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;everything still works accurately... but it doesn&#39;t go into a computer as quickly as some of the newer sources do... and since many in my sisterhood haven&#39;t found men to marry yet... they will still have to feed and thus have the need to be prepared for a pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Head Sister Julie then ushered you into one chair and tied a piece of surgical tubing around one arm, so to make sure she&#39;d get the blood she needed for these scientific tests. One of which was a test for a hormone that would indicate pregnancy. You looked away from Julie as she cleaned the inside of your elbow and prepared the needle to draw blood. Your eyes settled on Selene and Michael who had followed closely and gave you a confident smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine, Michelle, we&#39;ll be there for you,&quot; Michael told you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, brother,&quot; you said back to him.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take too long for Julie to collect all the blood she needed from you and as she finished she untied the surgical tubing around your arm, and let it free.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there we go,&quot; Julie said, &quot;I can put the blood in for the pregnancy test here and now... but the results won&#39;t be ready until tomorrow morning, I can then take the DNA tests into the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you said to Julie as Michael took your place in the chair and you approached Selene and glanced over to Emily and Jake. You felt you knew Jake fairly well, and found him to be a good friend but you didn&#39;t know Emily quite as well. &quot;And once she has all the blood from Michael... perhaps it would be best we fully and properly introduce ourselves to Emily...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot;  Selene nodded, &quot;a good idea.&quot;</p>
