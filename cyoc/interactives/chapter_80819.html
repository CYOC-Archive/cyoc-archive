<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Jacob Adams sat alone in his office, reading over the test results that he just come in this morning <br />
from the lab. He had a steaming cup of coffee on his desk, the fifth he'd had since yesterday. He had been <br />
working non-stop for hours after the police had busted the operation of Dr. Changes and it was becoming more <br />
and more difficult just to keep himself awake. They had been completely overwhelmed by the intake and had even <br />
requested help from other nearby hospitals to assist.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem was that he simple had no idea just what the hell they were dealing with, nothing in all <br />
his years of medical practice had come even close to what these patients were suffering from. He'd seen <br />
nothing like it, people who were half-fish, half-horse, half-lion... he had no words for it. Only now were <br />
they finally starting to understand just what had happened and he was able to allow his staff some time to <br />
breath. <br />
<br />
Based on the information the police had retrieved from Changes' operations and from what the mad doctor had <br />
revealed himself, these people had been altered on a genetic level. Since that was completely out of his <br />
hands, he now focused on assessing the health of well-being of the patients, which was still a challenge in of <br />
itself. With such an altered biology, it was no longer clear what their condition was. A number of tests had <br />
been performed on the patients and it was at least comforting to know that none of them were suffering from <br />
any ailments. <br />
<br />
There were, however, a fair number who were dangerously malnourished and underweight, a testament to the poor <br />
conditions that Changes had left them in. Until he knew exactly what kind of food they would need, all were to <br />
be given IV fluid until further notice. He estimated that maybe three to five might need more serious <br />
treatment, but he would have a better idea once he checked them this morning.<br />
<br />
Of course, with all of this going on, his job was difficult enough, but he also had to constantly dodge the <br />
press who were hungry to talk with him and the patients. Despite the best efforts of the police, he still <br />
found himself often cornered by one or two determined reporter demanding answers that he just couldn't give <br />
them. He had only been working with the patients for less than 24 hours, but these damn reporters expected him <br />
to be an expert almost immediately. The only place he could find peace and quite was right here in his office, <br />
and even that was under the threat of being overrun. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, did the lab find anything?&quot; Doctor Emily Wells asked as she entered his office, noting the folders on his <br />
desk. She too had a cup of coffee with her, along with the morning newspaper. <br />
<br />
Dr. Adams leaned back and rubbed his face, letting out a loud yawn. &quot;Nope, nothing. They are all free of <br />
infection, so we can at least thank the maker for that. But, between you and me, I have no idea where to go <br />
from here,&quot; he told her, taking a quick drink of coffee. &quot;I've literally never seen anything like this, hell I <br />
never thought anything like this was even possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, there's nothing that can be done about their, eh, 'condition'?&quot; She took a seat down next to his desk and <br />
grabbed the top folder off his desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is nothing WE can do about it, but maybe someone will find something among Changes' belongings,&quot; <br />
Adams stood up and stretched a little, ready to get on his feet again after sitting at his desk for the past <br />
few hours. &quot;At this point, all we can do is make sure they're as healthy as we can get them, which is easier <br />
said than done.&quot; He took one last drink of coffee before scooping up the pile of folders. &quot;Come on, I could <br />
use some help, I've got maybe a dozen or so to check up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adams and Wells left his office and made their way down to the emergency wing, where most of the patients were <br />
being housed for the time being until their conditions improved. The hospital was mostly quiet at the moment, <br />
once word reached them that there was nothing they could do about the patients' physiological changes, he <br />
dismissed most of his staff to finally go home and get some sleep. Right now only a skeleton crew remained to <br />
keep basic operations going. Adams himself had refused to go home, despite the long hours he had put in. He <br />
couldn't put his finger on it, but there was something that kept him motivated to make sure these people made <br />
in through, considering all they had been through already.<br />
<br />
Passing through the lobby, they noticed that, in addition to the few media personnel that had remained on the <br />
premises all through the night, there were now a small group of civilians holding signs, most demanding that <br />
the patients not be allowed to leave. It wasn't exactly that surprising, Adams had figured that once people <br />
learned about what had happened and had seen these people, they'd be frightened and demand that they be locked <br />
up or something. What was uprising is just how fast that they had begun to organize; it hadn't even been 24-<br />
hours and already they were outside the hospital, waving their signs around.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think they will be a problem?&quot; Wells asked as the two of them entered the emergency wing. <br />
<br />
&quot;At this point, I just don't care. Let them protest out there, as long as they don't interfere with our work, <br />
I'll tolerate them,&quot; Adams replied before stopping at the first room. &quot;Alright, our first patient is an adult <br />
male, of undetermined age, who seems to have been given the genes of a Great Horned Owl. When he came in <br />
yesterday, he was not responsive at all and was just barely conscious, so we were unable to get any <br />
information about who he is or where he's from and he came in with no form of identification,&quot; Adams explained <br />
as he opened up his file and handed Wells the rest of the folders. &quot;Hopefully we can get some information out <br />
of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adams gently knocked on the door, but after waiting a minute with no response, he opened up and entered with <br />
Wells. Sprawled out on the hospital bed was basically a human-sized bird, there was barely anything to <br />
indicate this had, in fact once been a person. Wells was a little reluctant to get close, despite already <br />
seeing a few already, she was still a little freaked out at their sight. It was hard to believe it was a <br />
living thing and not some cheap costume or something. Adams was so tired that he just didn't seem to care <br />
anymore and was more than willing to approach and even touch them. &quot;Young man, are you awake?&quot; Adams asked as <br />
he walked over to the side of the bed. <br />
<br />
Ron, for his part, finally stirred, though he was still fairly drowsy. He turned onto his back and opened his <br />
eyes, nodding at the doctor. &quot;Yeah... ugh... but I feel horrible,&quot; Ron remarked as he moved and tried to sit <br />
up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well if is of any comfort to hear, you have no infections,&quot; Adams remarked with a slight shrug. &quot;But <br />
I'm sure that's the least of your worries. As for your, condition, well, there isn't anything we can do about <br />
it. Whatever Dr. Changes did to you, it affected you on a cellular level, manipulating your very DNA. That is <br />
far beyond the scope of what we are able to fix.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, one of my fellow experiments, a woman named Leona, told about it. Some kind of gene-altering serum we <br />
were injected with, something like that. I don't really remember everything she told me,&quot; Ron replied and let <br />
out a sigh, which ended up sounding like a hoot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonetheless, we will do all in our ability to make sure you have a full recovery. When you were brought in <br />
you were severally underweight and malnourished, that's why we hooked an IV up to your arm. Now, while we have <br />
the chance, we do need to get some information from you, first off your full name,&quot; Adams replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course, my name is Ron Isaac Evans. Oh, could I please have some water, I'm quite thirsty,&quot; he <br />
remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Dr. Wells, you mind?&quot; Adams motioned for her to get him something to drink. She nodded and left <br />
the room. &quot;Alright, oh and let me introduced myself, I'm Dr. Jacob Adams, I'm the senior doctor here and have <br />
been overseeing the care of you and your fellow victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, well then let me extend my thanks, I know if can't be easy to work around people that look... well <br />
that look like this,&quot; Ron replied, tugging on some of the feathers on his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I know it's not your fault you are suffering from this condition. Anyway, to be honest, what's going <br />
on here, it's something big. As insane as Dr. Changes is, he's certainly accomplished something here and who <br />
knows just what the aftermath of all of this will be. I can't help but be a little glad to be in the middle of <br />
all this, but I digress. Now, do you have any family for friends we can get into contact with? We hope to have <br />
you out fairly soon, and I can't imagine you have anywhere to go after being locked up for as long as you <br />
have,&quot; Adams remarked.</p>
