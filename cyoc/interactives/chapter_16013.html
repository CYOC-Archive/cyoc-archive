<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had been thinking about what he could use his powers for the next day.  He wanted to try something really... big.  Not for himself mind you.  He wanted to make a big wish, but he was at a loss.  He lay on his bed thinking, when Dustin wandered in.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Hey Ty, looks like we don't have class tomorrow.&quot;  He said, waving a flyer.  &quot;One of the guys from the wrestling team just dropped off this ad saying that there's going to be a huge match tomorrow at school.&quot;  Ty looked up and grabbed the paper, looking it over.  On one side was Mark, the captain of the school wrestling team.  He was 6'1&quot;, 180 pounds, broad shouldered and muscular... he was also a prick.  On the other side was Derek, the captain of Midwich High School's team. 6'1, 180 pounds as well... and just as built.  Ty had met him before, he was just as much of a prick.  Ty could have fun with this...  He thought a few moments and made his wish.  It was very specific.  He wished that whenever one of these two wrestlers would get put in a hold, they would start to get fatter. 5 pounds a second should do it.  He then wished that the wrestlers would find the change exceedingly erotic, yet completely normal, and that the crowd found this normal too, until the match ended.  Ty told his plan to Dustin, both had a good chuckle before going to bed.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
  The next day at school was packed, students from both schools crammed into the gym to watch the action.  Ty wished himself and Dustin into the front seats.  In a few minutes, the wrestlers approached from their locker rooms, both clad in the singlet of their school colors.  Mark wore green and Yellow, Derek wore red and white.  The lycra showed off every line of their bodies.  They could've been body doubles.  The wrestlers took their positions, and the crowd went silent.  The ref started the match, and Derek came in with a grapple.  Ty then wished that the ref wouldn't stop a hold for any reason... unless it were fatal anyway.  He held onto Mark like he was going to dissappear, and Ty's wish went into action.  Mark's flat stomach slowly began to curve down as he wriggled against Derek.  Mark reversed against his attacker, and grabbed Derek, placing his hands under his arms and behind his head.  Derek felt the smooth fleshy curve of Marks stomach fit into the arch of his back, and then began to feel his own belly begin to curve out.  Mark managed to hold him for a full 7 seconds, just as long as he had held mark.  <br />
<br />
  Ty had been counting the weight changes in his mind.  They were both up to 215 now.  Derek could feel his dick being crushed in his cup, his erection was so hard.  As they took their positions he noticed that Mark had an erection too, but wasn't wearing a cup.  He casually slipped his hand up the lef of his singlet and removed the uncomfortable contraption.  Ty looked back and forth.  Not only were they the same weight and height, the both looked like they had the same size dick!  These guys were meant for one another.  The next assault started, this time Mark quickly getting the upper hand.  Derek was caught by the ankles, and his body began to expand once again.  Dereks once slim body was pumping up as Mark held him.  The school supplied singlet was obviously cheap, as the stitching on the sides of the abdomen began to pop.  Mark held the other guy for a full 10 seconds on this one.  The slight curve of Dereks stomach had become a full blown arch, and the defined lines of his quads and biceps had become soft and jiggly.  Ty tallied up the weight, Derek was now 265.<br />
<br />
  As fat as he'd become, he still had his agility.  Derek quickly threw mark down and got his arms wrapped around him.  Mark wiggled, trying to get his way out of the hold.  His stomach began to inflate, his face plumped up, his quads smoothed out and his ass swelled.  His singlet began to rip at the gut as well.  These guys were in a dead heat, as Mark escaped the hold in 10 seconds as well.  Both the 265 pound wrestlers were beginning to look more like Sumo Wrestlers.  Derek lunged forth again, grasping the tubby Mark.  He began to swell once more.  Mark could feel Dereks big belly and big cock rubbing his back as he swelled in the fat Jocks grasp.  His singlet ripped up to the armpits. and the seat ripped down his ass crack all the way to his crotch.  His big belly pulled the rip up to his chest, and the legs gave way as well.  The torn material fell, allowing Marks erection to bob toward the floor, and his belly to jiggle as it bounced due to gravity.  Now he was naked, 315 pounds, and horny.  He reversed Derek, and grabbed him by the waist.<br />
<br />
  Derek began to inflate, the crowd cheered.  His already ample fat began to multiply.  His own singlet began to tear.  He couldn't get out of this one... it was too hard to maneuver this way.  His singlet popped right off, just as Marks had, and he was there before the crowd, Naked, fat and expanding.  Then, as Mark adjusted his stance, they felt something out of the ordinary.  Marks hard cock slipped right into Dereks fat ass crack.  Ty looked on in puzlement as Mark began to expand as well. The 315 pound behemoths were technically both holding each other.  Marks huge belly swelled down over Dereks back, and Dereks belly slowly sagged to the floor. 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350.  The ref wasn't stopping this, and the crowd was cheering... Ty had wished that they found this completely normal.  Dereks swelling ass and Marks fattening groin were slowly pushing the inflating wrestlers apart.  But not quickly, they were both exceeding 450 now.  Derek had given up on reversing the hold, and was stroking his cock as it slowly sank into his own, growing fat.<br />
<br />
  Dustin and Ty watched as the two monster jocks inched closer and closer to immobility.  500 pounds came and went.  The jocks didn't even resemble their former selves.  Their old, squared features were replaced with soft, growing curves.  600 pounds....  Dustin nudged Ty &quot;When will it stop?&quot;  Ty thought a moment.  &quot;When the ref calls it a tie.&quot;  Ty made a wish to make the ref respond to the situation when he saw fit.  The wrestlers went on grappling, expanding for 20 more seconds. His whistle blew the second they wrestlers reached 700 pounds.  Mark and Derek fell to each side, panting, looking at their bodies.  Proud of what they had become, the ref announced the game as a tie, and the audience finally realized what had happened.  They had witnessed two senior students gain almost 700 pounds, and technically engage in sex.  They began to murmur to one another.  Derek and Mark slowly came to the realization that they had gotten fatter during the match, and that that wasn't a normal part of wrestling.  They were obese!</p>
