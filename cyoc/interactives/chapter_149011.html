<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">10 year old Thomas had what to most would be a normal life. He had a loving family, a dozen or so close friends and a decent IQ. But even with all that he felt something was still missing. His Dad had something to do with that. His father, Frank was a perfect man in the eyes of his son. He was nothing but nice to the boy and that was what nagged at him. He always measured himself up to his father and came up short. He wanted to be just like him and fast. &quot;Sigh... I want to be an adult soon...&quot; Thomas said to himself. He was alone in the living room. His mother had taken his sister to see a movie with her friends. As for the object of his desire, Frank was upstairs in his bedroom, having gotten a call from work. It was the perfect moment for something big to happen without anyone knowing and it all started with a ring. <br />
<br />
Thomas looked at his pocket where his phone had beeped to indicate he had a message waiting. &quot;Wonder who it is?&quot; he thought as he took out his phone. But when he looked, there were no text messages at all. &quot;That&#39;s strange...&quot; Thomas figured he must have heard wrong and started to put the phone away when something caught his eye. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; he stared at his apps and found one he never saw before. &quot;The Wish Granting App?&quot; That was what it said. Confused, Thomas opened it and got a message. &quot;Thank you for clicking on the Wish Granting App, Mr Thomas Smith. We aim to grant people any wish they so desire. At a price of $5.99 a month, just type your many desires into the app and have them granted in no time flat. We allow one free wish as a starter, so if you feel unsatisfied, you may delete the app free of charge. We hope you enjoy our services.&quot; &quot;What the heck?&quot; Thomas was weirded out. An app that could grant wishes? There was no way something like that could exist. &quot;This is silly.&quot; Thomas made to delete the app. After all, not only could science do no such thing, having an app you didn&#39;t download could destroy his cell phone. His parents told him that repeatedly. But he hesitated. After all, there was one thing he wanted right away and that was enough to give him pause. &quot;There&#39;s no way this is real...&quot; Thomas said with a chuckle. He opened up the app again and pressed enter. Up on the screen now was a place to type in. Above it a simple question. &quot;What do you wish for?&quot; Thomas paused once again. &quot;This is a joke. No way can I can my wishes come true,&quot; Thomas thought to himself as he typed in his wish. &quot;I wish I could be an adult, just like my dad.&quot; Thomas looked at the screen once more and pressed enter.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, the screen changed once again. &quot;Thank you for trying out our Wish Granting services. Your wish shall be granted in 10 seconds.&quot; And also on it a timer that was counting down from ten. &quot;So this is it huh?&quot; Thomas was still not taking it seriously, but he did feel a little tense as he stared at the timer as it went past five to four to three... 2... 1... and zero! Everything was silent as Thomas sat still. A few more seconds passed, but nothing was happening. &quot;I knew it. There was no way this would work. Thomas went back to the main menu and deleted the app. And that was when it happened. &quot;Agh! Gah!&quot; Thomas doubled over in pain. His whole body felt like it was on fire. He tried to right himself up, but could only fall back onto the couch. &quot;Agh! It hurts! Help!!&quot; Thomas tried to scream out to his dad, but he could barely get the words out. Unable to do anything but lay there, he started to convulse. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; Thomas could only let out pained grunts as the shaking continued. Unable to control his body any longer, he soiled himself. With tears running down his eyes, he could only think to himself. &quot;Daddy...&quot; Just when all hope seemed lost, a light shaped ball came out of his mouth. &quot;What is that...?&quot; was all Thomas could think as he lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, upstairs, Frank Smith was talking to one of his work colleagues about a project they were working on. &quot;Yeah... That&#39;s right... No. Tell Mike we need twenty, not ten... That&#39;s right... Thanks Nick... Yeah... I&#39;ll see you tomorrow morning then... Bye.... Phew!&quot; Frank let out a deep breath. Work for him was always exhausting, but this project was straining him thin. &quot;Sometimes, I wish I could get away from it all,&quot; he said to himself. He paid it no mind though. He had to set an example for his son so he could grow into a fine young man. &quot;Speaking of which, I better go back to him.&quot; Frank and Thomas had been watching TV together, when he got the call from work. He was about to get up, when his phone rang again with a text message. &quot;Jesus, what is it this time?!&quot; Thinking it was from Butch, he opened his phone only to be met with a number he didn&#39;t recognize. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Frank opened the message, only to be met with a weirder sight. The message said, &quot;Hello, Mr Frank Smith. Your son, Thomas has made a wish to be an adult just like you. We wanted to warn you that this will involve participation on your part. So please prepare yourself --- Wish Granting App.&quot; &quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Frank was bewildered. How did this unknown messenger know his son&#39;s name? Why was it saying it was granting his wishes? &quot;Is this spam? Wonder if I should...&quot; But before he could finish his sentence, he felt strange. &quot;Ah... Oh... Woah!&quot; Frank dropped his phone and fell to his knees. He could feel his body heating up. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?! Agh!&quot; Before he could even get his bearings, a searing pain rushed throughout his body. He fell down and started to convulse. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; Unable to speak, he returned to nothing but his thoughts. &quot;My body! I can&#39;t control it! Shit!&quot; Frank continued to have a seizure as his body shook up and down. He could feel a wet spot in his pants. &quot;Jesus Christ! I just fucking wet myself!&quot; Frank thought he was going to die, as a white ball of light pushed out of his mouth and with it his consciousness started to fade. &quot;Dammit...&quot; was all he thought as he blacked out completely.</p>
