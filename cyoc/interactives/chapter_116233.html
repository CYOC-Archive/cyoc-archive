<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since last summer, Megan has been jealous of her best friend. While she worked her body hard with cheerleading and gymnastics to get her fit form, Jenny hit the puberty lottery and has it naturally. Over one summer, her ass completely filled out, her hips widened, her boobs exploded to DDs and she kept her beautiful youthful face and super tiny waist and toned tummy. But since she dresses so modestly, the whole school, including Megan, though she just got fat. Some even thought she was pregnant. Megan didn&#39;t even know until one day Jenny came over to her pool after school. Megan tried to show up her friend by wearing tiny tops and super small shorts, but nothing could make her feel prettier than Giant Jugs Jenny. But now she could change that. Jen will finally say she&#39;s the pretty one. Megan can win.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
I flip around and sit on a bench with my new magic book to think, kind of enjoying how the cold plastic feels on my bare ass. First I scribble in &quot;Whoever writes this sentence is the only person who can use this book forever.&quot; The ink shimmers into gold again and I knows the magic is done. I looks to my friend and hold the book open to her. &quot;Look Jennifer. Now it&#39;s my book and my ass looks fantastic. What do you have to say about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want you to be careful, Megan.&quot; Jesus doesn&#39;t this girl have a jealous bone in her body. Well she&#39;s dressed like a 90s good girl with her white turtleneck under her pink plaid button-up dress, white stockings, gold charm necklace, black Mary Jane&#39;s, and pale pink headband to hold back her thick brown hair. I stand up and walk over to her behind. Even in her square shaped frock, I can still see her incredible figure underneath. I compare my ass to hers and dammit, they&#39;re the same size. Well time to pick something else. I face my friend closely, eyeing her chest. Shit, her breasts are almost ready to bust through the tightly-pulled fabric. Jen blushes. &quot;I know this dress is pretty immodest. I have been meaning to go get a bigger size, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Immodest? It&#39;s not your dress it&#39;s your boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;ve developed a bit over the summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;A bit?&#39; You have the biggest boobs in school! And you don&#39;t even know how to use them. Here.&quot;<br />
<br />
I scribble down &quot;I wish I had size FF breasts&quot; into the book. &quot;I&#39;ll show you what real breasts can do.&quot; The ink shimmers gold. I take off my tee shirt and throw it across the floor, leaving me only in my thin blue tank top. My breasts barely qualify as an A so I can get away with no bra. But not for long. My nipples start to tingle, nothing I haven&#39;t felt before on a cold day. I look down and watch as they stand erect an inch out of my chest. Suddenly something warm starts slowly pouring into my chest. As the feeling grows, my small bumps start to thicken and grow meaty. For the first time I actually have underboob. &quot;Look it happening! Get ready to be second best, Jenny&quot; I gawk once they reach a B. But Jen only watches me with worried eyes. Whatever, she&#39;ll see once I&#39;m done.<br />
<br />
They keep growing, blowing up like water balloons. My heart beats fast with the pleasure of that gooey warm feeling in chest. I squish one in hand and it sends waves of pleasure through my body. &quot;I can&#39;t even fit my hand around it anymore. What do you have to say about that, Giant Jugs Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that happens.&quot; God I&#39;m still not big enough. My skin stretches very tightly across my chest to match the growth and they swing as I move around. This is incredible! They keep growing and growing even when I can&#39;t see my toes anymore. &quot;Oh my god this feels so frickin amazing, Jenny.&quot; I start to moan and feel ny motor start to run. The pumping slows down, but its still filling me up. My mams are filling out so well that my tank top is struggling hold it all in and I feel a breeze on my stomach. I grab Jenny&#39;s hand and the book and go over to a mirror, my breasts sloshing and bounding around as I run. &quot;Holy shit I&#39;m huge!&quot; My elastic top has been stretched so far that it can&#39;t even cover my underboob.<br />
<br />
The warmth in my bust cools down and the goo drips to a halt. But my goal has been reached. I am, at least, 2 cup sizes bigger than Jen and there&#39;s nothing she can say now. &quot;What do you have to say now, Jen? Feeling inadequate?&quot; I shake my heft around waiting for her to grovel.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you&#39;re happy.&quot; Jen says, as proper as ever. &quot;We should probably find you a good bra though, come on.&quot; She starts walking into a department store. &quot;What?!&quot; I storm over to her. &quot;But I&#39;m bigger than you now. Doesn&#39;t that mean something?&quot; Jenny shrugs. &quot;Argh! Are you kidding me? Let me show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I open the book and start writing, which is kind of hard now with these melons in my way. &quot;I wish that Jenny was topless.&quot; The ink turns gold and Jenny&#39;s dress starts unbuttoning itself. &quot;Come on, please Megan. Don&#39;t do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I need to show you that I&#39;m bigger than you.&quot; The magic stops halfway down her dress and lifts the turtleneck off her shoulders. My smile fades when I see the binding holding herself back. Damn how big did she get in the last month? Is she really so big that no bra can hold her? The magic unwraps her a few strips from her body before the sheer built up power of her mighty bosom breaks out. I can&#39;t even speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you not to.&quot; Jenny says trying to cover herself up with her arms to no avail. She&#39;s even bigger than me. &quot;W-what size?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What size!&quot; Jen hangs her head. &quot;I last measured last Tuesday at 42GG. But I think it&#39;s slowing down.&quot; She tries to button her dress back up, but can&#39;t get the top six buttons, leaving her with a very large amount of cleavage.<br />
<br />
Furious almost to the point of tears, I open the book. First, I write &quot;I wish I could move the book and pen with my mind.&quot; Instantly they start to float next to us, ready for me to write. &quot;I wish I had three of Jennifer&#39;s cup sizes.&quot; With a loud pop, my chest balloons out while her&#39;s shrink enough to let her button two more. My tank top gives up and rip straight down the middle, leaving me completelt naked in the middle of the mall with only the straps hanging off my shoulder. &quot;Ha! Now I AM bigger than you! What now?&quot; Jenny turns around to pick up her turtleneck, her big booty shaking as she walks. &quot;Whatever makes you feel better Megan.&quot; Dammit, I forgot about her ass. &quot;I wish my ass absorbed three pant sizes from Jenny.&quot; The pen writes it down and the ink turns gold. With a another pop, my ass blows up like a blimp while her&#39;s recedes a little into the silhouette of her dress. &quot;Now I am definitely the biggest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cool, Jennifer replies &quot;Size isn&#39;t everything.&quot; I growl and make another wish. The ink turns gold and my tank top melts off my shoulders and stretches across my body. It solidifies as a dark blue embroidered bustier that hangs off my shoulders and a matching dark blue pencil skirt and black heels. The bustier leaves a good portion of my midriff exposed and looks delicate, all while somehow holding up my beach balls. Magic. The skirt also holds under all of my ass, giving me the best silhouette. Magic. I refocus on my face in mirror as the magic also does my hair and makeup, blowing out my long blonde hair and giving me a sexy cat eye and deep red lip.<br />
<br />
I look hot.<br />
<br />
I stroll over to Jennifer, who is tying her turtleneck around her waist. I take a spin to give her a good 360° view and rest one hand on her shoulder. &quot;Now I&#39;m the sexiest. Probably the hottest that has ever been. Now what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for making me smaller. Its really going to help my family out when I need to buy clothes.&quot; I cross my arms over my chest to pout. &quot;You really don&#39;t care do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you feel good about yourself and you&#39;you&#39;re not hurting anyone....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP IT! Quit being so perfect you make me so mad! What am I going to do to make you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
I pace for a bit before finally picking a suitable charge. &quot;I know.&quot; The pen clicks ready to scribe my next wish as Jennifer waits in fear.</p>
