<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For about an hour, Jeff stood there on all fours, legs naturally locked in position while he slept for an afternoon nap. His mind was lost to the world. <br />
<br />
When he finally began to wake up again, feeling somewhat refreshed from his strange nightmare of turning himself into a donkey, he stretched his legs, yawned with an extended &quot;haawww,&quot; and wanted to raise a fist to wipe the sleep from his eyes. But something was wrong. He wasn&#39;t moving. At least, not in the way he had expected. He discovered he was standing, not lying down. Standing....on all fours! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww,&quot; he gaped in an animalistic fashion. Unable to speak!<br />
<br />
He craned his long neck to look back along his thick flank. Gray fur-covered hide over a barrel-shaped body ending in four legs with hooves underneath him and a rounded rump that sorta looked like the shape of a loaf of bread way in the back. The rump, he could only imagine, ending in a big black puckered hole. He saw glimpses of his tail whip in and out of his vision in agitation.<br />
<br />
He stood there, observing his strange new body sorta disconnected from reality, thinking incredulously...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey? Im...a...fucking...DONKEY!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought, as it began to hit home what his new life would be like, both terrified and excited him at the same time. It turned into the physical reaction of his new big, black, penis dropping out of its sheath and growing long and hard. His second erection as this male donkey!<br />
<br />
He also felt hungry. With no real opportunity to grasp his erection, Jeff felt compelled to just pick up the habits of the body he exchanged with. He started grazing. <br />
<br />
At first, he tried resisting putting mouth to earth. Afterall, that&#39;s what hands are for. But he didn&#39;t have hands. He could no longer grasp anything and would be forced to eat with his mouth like a God damn barnyard animal with no manner. Which is exactly what he was now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I&#39;m just a donkey now, I guess,&quot; he thought, as he tried ignoring the erection that just bumped up a notch with his latest thought. Mentally shrugging his shoulders, he could no longer resist the growing urge to begin....grazing....on grass....with his dirty, unwashed, blackish-yellow blocky teeth....<br />
<br />
Cringing with the thoughts of chewing up grass to a thick, green paste between the foreign teeth of a dirty obnoxious farm animal, and experiencing swallowing it, he began eating anyway. The donkey&#39;s body needed the nourishment. The first few bites were agonizingly disgusting. He mentally wanted to puke, but his donkey organs wouldn&#39;t allow for it. He quickly lost more and more control, as the residual instincts took over. Eventually, Jeff BECAME just the mindless beast he took over as. The grazing seemed to dull his human intellect, as it sort of &quot;gave up,&quot; mostly out of boredom. His second erection went away during this time. <br />
<br />
After several hours of mindlessly munching on grass, Jeff&#39;s body finally began to feel satiated. His mind sorta &quot;woke up,&quot; with the realization of what he had been doing for the better part of the day. The shadows were growing longer, as the light from the sun had shifted lower in the sky. <br />
<br />
The advancing daylight made Jeff feel a bit depressed. He literally did nothing all day long, and now evening was fast approaching. But how could he do anything? He was stuck as a donkey on a farm. He only had hooves. He began to miss his hands. But that was the price he had to pay in permanantly switching bodies with a donkey. He wanted to feel the frustrations of the limitations of this body. This is exactly what Jeff wanted. To miss useful hands. For them to feel &quot;cramped&quot; as a couple of blockey hooves. And boy, did his &quot;hands&#39;&quot; feel cramped now! <br />
<br />
Jeff tried mentally to remove those blocks and release his fingers. But of course, it would be impossible! It was beginning to feel...almost like being forced to wear steel-toed boots for more than an entire day now, and wanting desperately to take them off so you could freely move your toes. Only he felt this growing crampiness with his non-existant hands and fingers. His hooves were like being forced to wear impossible-to-remove boots on four feet. <br />
<br />
He continued to try and &quot;wiggle&quot; his &quot;fingers&quot; out of their traps with growing desperation. He tried yelling out for help, but was greeted with his body&#39;s donkey vocalization instead:<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaww!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t speak!&quot; Jeff thought with both fear and pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww hheee hhhaaw!&quot; Jeff brayed some more. &quot;I&#39;m a fucking donkey! Well and truly stuck as this beast!,&quot; he thought as he began stomping his hooves on the ground while braying out, trying to proclaim his donkeyhood in words he can never speak. <br />
<br />
His erection came back with a vengeance. His cock grew straight out, stiff as a pole. The thoughts he was now stuck as this beast, and what his first day was like, with many more just like it to come. Jeff will never have hands or a voice ever again. <br />
<br />
His cock strained as he reached his crescendo. Screaming into the empty and careless wind, &quot;heeee hhhaaww hheee hhhaaww hhhee hhhaawww!&quot; Stomping his hooves that will keep his hands locked away forever. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEEEEEEE HHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW!!!!!&quot; His big black cocktail exploded as before. His brain went haywire over the intense release. He automatically tried gripping the earth with his fingerless hooves. Several waves hit his entire being, as a gallon of donkey seed was released at his front two feet, he still thinks of as hands. <br />
<br />
The intensity began to subside, as Jeff slowly came back to his other senses. Yup. Still here as a fucking donkey. Still on all fours. Now with his underside and front legs covered in fresh spunk that naturally isn&#39;t even his. <br />
<br />
As before, his habit from when he was still human; was to wash up, get changed, play video games, etc, after a good jerkoff session of imagining becoming a donkey on a full-time bases. His desire to be stuck as a donkey would fade away as he went about his normal daily routines once he satiated himself. <br />
<br />
Once his jerkoff session was complete and he came down from his high, for a moment, Jeff thought he was human and was about to go wash up and go about his normal human life. When he opened his giant brown eyes and thumped his right forehoof on the ground, the reality of his situation came crashing down around him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaw,&quot; he said, unable to mutter even the simplest of words. &quot;I&#39;m still...a donkey...&quot; He thought. He was trapped on all fours. With this disgusting body. He couldn&#39;t even wipe off the residual jizz from his white belly fur. The idea of being stuck like this excited him some more, in a terrifying sort of way. But he was already spent. He couldn&#39;t jackoff again. At least, not until his huge wobbly balls filled back up. He could feel them tingling back there, even as he stood there pondering his fate. <br />
<br />
The long shadows of his big broad tall ears he is now permantly stuck with caught his attention. It made his stomach drop, to know those ridiculous things were attached to his head. Jeff brayed at his shadow. He knew his position would turn him on, and be the cause of the greatest ejaculations ever experienced. But those experiences would be quick, and few and far between. In the meantime, while his testicles would be regenerating more seed, he would be stuck as a God damn donkey, only able to do donkey shit all day every day. All of this, just for a few moments of ecstacy each day. <br />
<br />
Earlier, his &quot;trapped hands inside boots&quot; thing was the source of his excitement. But he STILL felt like his hands were trapped! How much he would love to unfurl his fingers and stretch them out! Earlier it was his source of sexual excitement. Now, it was just extremely annoying and inconvenient. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want my hands back, dammit!&quot; Jeff thought, as he thumped his forelegs off the ground. &quot;Heee hhhaaww!&quot; The bray was further humiliation and restriction on his physical abilities to him. <br />
<br />
Mentally, everytime Jeff tried &quot;moving&quot; his fingers, it would cause him a little bit more stress and inches him closer to panic. It was ecoming a phobia to him, much like being buried alive. He NEEDED to be able to &quot;stretch&quot; his &quot;fingers.&quot; But such an activity would be denied him. Forever. He was stuck &quot;wearing&quot; what felt like to him, steel toed boots on feet that replaced his hands. <br />
<br />
Add to the fact he is forever stuck on all fours, can never speak again, and stuck with humiliating big long and wide donkey ears to the top sides of his donkey skull. He felt a rising panic, which only the momentary bliss of masturbation could relieve. But such relief would only come for a brief period of time, once a day. His balls needed the better part of a day o regenerate. <br />
<br />
All Jeff could do, was mentally try and keep himself from panicking. He just had to live with his new situation. He had to keep himself from trying to waggle his fingers. He had to imagine that his ears fit his new station in life, and that he just looked like an ordinary donkey. So anyone looking at him, would just see a donkey rather than Jeff&#39;s face with donkey ears. He had to get used to the fact that he no longer had a voice, other than that of the ragged bray of a jackass. <br />
<br />
His stomach rumbled. Grass. The smell of fresh grass caught his attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not again,&quot; he mentally sighed. &quot;I&#39;m getting sick of eating grass...&quot; Another thing he had to get used to; a very limited diet. He wanted to eat a hoagie or a pizza or something. But he&#39;s stuck only eating grass. And hay. Jeff couldn&#39;t resist the needs of his body, and he began to graze again. As before, at the start if the session, Jeff&#39;s mentality was just sort of along for the ride, protesting periodically whenever his head dipped for more sustenance. As before, Jeff slowly went into a trance-like state to the point that all that was left of him, was nothing but a mindless old donkey. <br />
<br />
He spent the rest of this second day like that, in his nightmarish furry hoof-clad four-legged prison, just grazing until the long shadows started fading as the day light waned into evening. Satiated from two more hours of grazing on field grass, Jeff &quot;came-to&quot; again with dawning realization that, once again, he had accomplished nothing of note. The day had slipped by, and he was still stuck as a fucking donkey. This was when he started to become depressed, as his realization of just how long &quot;eternity&quot; was going to be in his unnatural state. All he could do, was let out a mournful bray that he intended to be a sigh. &quot;Haaawww.&quot; The half-unexpected noise just made him dip his long face in shame.</p>
