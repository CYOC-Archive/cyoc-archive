<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Princess Eve and her new husband stride out of the throne room and are quickly surrounded by castle guards. The head guard salutes to Lord Richard, who salutes back, and they begin to escort the new couple through the castle. Eve follows her husband&#39;s lead and remains happily on his arm. But as the guards lead them through the castle that she grew up in, Eve notices that they are going the wrong way. &quot;Richard? I do believe that the reception ball is going to be in the Grand Ballroom. We&#39;re walking the wrong way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard clears his thought and lowers his head to closer to hers and whispers, &quot;Dear wife, we are not going to the reception. Not yet. We have one last thing we must do first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I trust you then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Princess.&quot; Richard bows his head slightly before returning to his regal posture amongst his lesser guards. Eve is confused, her father had spared no expense on the ball planned for after her wedding. Hundreds of guests will be attending. Where are they going?<br />
<br />
When realizes where they are being led, Eve second guesses her husband&#39;s nobility. Blushing, she whispers to the knight, &quot;I had hoped we could enjoy the festivities before heading to your chambers.&quot; The guards make the last left turn into the officer&#39;s wing, a section of the castle where high ranking men of Erotos&#39;s militaries could be quartered. As the Captain of the Erotoan Knights, Richard also has that privilege. But instead of turning around and heading to the party, Richard instructs the guards to leave them. Each guard salutes and quickly make themselves scarce.<br />
<br />
Now alone with only Eve, a sudden weariness takes over the Knight. He runs a hand through his golden hair. &quot;Forgive me Princess for being so forward. But I must insist.&quot; He takes her wrist, much more impatiently than Eve thought him to be capable of, and rushes down the hall of rooms until they reach the very last one. Each door they passed had a symbol at the top of the door representing the military service of the occupying officer, be it an anchor, sabre, cannon, or the like. This door has the crest of the Erotoan Knights on it. His room.<br />
<br />
Richard places his hand on the doorknob and Eve is surprised by a white flash of light suddenly emanating from around the door frame. She turns to him to question his strange trick but is doubly shocked to see his eyes glowing white.<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess, do not be afraid. But come with me, quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
He holds his hand out to her but she hesitates. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the captain of your father&#39;s knights and your husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what trick is this? What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He visibly flinches at her query. &quot;I... I am blessed. But come with me and I can explain more.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Princess thinks about her options, chooses the only one that could give her answers, and takes his hand. With an impressively strong tug, Richard pulls her into the room with him. Once Eve stops spinning, she notices the panoramic view from his windows, which should not be possible from the ground floor. &quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard helps her remove her remove her royal cape. &quot;We are in my quarters, our quarters. I had prepared it the best I could for your arrival.&quot; It is quite a luxurious space but with plenty of gleaming swords, spears, and other weapons out on display. Mannequins line one wall with various sets of armor and chain mail, as would befit a royal knight. He walks up to a free mannequin and begins to remove pieces of his armor. In his haste, he begins to struggle with some of the straps. Eve walks closer and begins to aide him. &quot;The room is fine. But it is odd. We should still be on the main floor of the palace, yet,&quot; she looks out one of the windows, &quot;I can see all the way to the ports in the town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because we are at the top of the castle&#39;s tallest tower now. I had a court wizard help build this place for myself years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are so young.&quot;<br />
<br />
The large chest and shoulder plates of his armor have been removed and placed on the mannequin. Richard begins to remove the legs pieces himself. &quot;I have served Erotos for many years. More years than I can remember. Your father was a young man, younger than you Princess, when we first met.&quot; He removes his legs guards, and lets them fall to the stone floor. The knight takes care to remove his belt with his sheathed sword and places it in its place of honor on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Younger than me? I don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will.&quot; Richard lifts his arms up to remove the heavy chain mail and tunic beneath and tosses them onto the floor as if they were nothing but cotton. Now shirtless, Eve is exposed to her first man. He is strong; arms and chest rippling with toned muscle from years, no, decades of combat. He is incredibly attractive to the young woman, but a detail puzzles her. &quot;You bear no scars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have healed.&quot; He turns to the Princess and approaches her, regaining that anxious energy from before he unarmed himself. Only in his trousers and leather boots, Richard approaches Eve and takes her delicate chin in his hand. She freezes in place and doesn&#39;t say a word, remembering that she was told by the other maidens to let her new husband have her. As he begins to kiss her though, she becomes much more invested in her position as wife and lets him happily. His strong arms pull her body close to his and she finally gets to feel the strength of his powerful core warm her. Eve does not seem to notice that her mate&#39;s eyes have begun to glow white again as he pulls her more towards the bed.<br />
<br />
Though she does not understand everything that is happening, Richard seems a man possessed. His hands suddenly seem to be all over her body at once as he gets her on her back on the bed. His body continues to grow warmer and warmer and the white light coming from his eyes is growing brighter, but Eve cannot look away. At some point, he must have lifted up the skirts of her dress. At some point, he must have laid down on her and entered. At some point, large white wings made of pure white light flare out from his back. The Princess has her arms wrapped around her lover&#39;s back to hold on as he thrusts into her but she cannot feel where those giant wings connect to his body. She has never seen anything so magnificent but cannot spare the breath to ask as her new husband is earnestly making love to her.<br />
<br />
As he brings her closer and closer to her first climax, Eve can feel something inside of her heating up. Looking directly into Richard&#39;s burning white eyes, she can feel a radiant energy connecting to that building warmth inside. From Richard&#39;s perspective, he can feel his powers flowing into his new bride. Her long brown hair is slowly lightening into golden blonde, like his. Her eyes flicker to fully white to project her new divine essence. He can feel the warmth of her soul beginning to take flame, and it excites him. So as she cries out and grasps onto him tighter in climax, and her own wings of light spread out from her back, he soon follows. The two angelic beings both emit an intense white aura that streaks out of the windows of their bed chamber, emitting from the top of the tower like a lighthouse.</p>
