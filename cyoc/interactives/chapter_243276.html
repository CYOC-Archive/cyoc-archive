<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan went on her personal office elevator and begun her usual walk routine around the building to make sure that every employee in the building was doing fine. Even if Susan saw herself as the alpha of the pack. She was obligated by her own nature to take care of her growing cubs. She made sure that she was the last one to leave the building as a good leader should. On Susan’s usual check-up routine she came across a man sitting in the cafeteria area all by himself. He was dressed in all black suit sipping coffee from a white cup like as if he owned the place. His sitting position’s pose looked strong and it beamed confidence.<br />
<br />
Susan had never seen this particular man before and by his looks and fashion sense he looked like an outsider like Thea. Susan glanced at the man and noticed how the black dress pants, black jacket, white dress shirt under it and his rectangle black rimmed eyeglasses weren’t just a fashion choice. They were a statement what his values represented. The greased up short black hair and the clean five o’clock with a goatee shave made his pale white colored skin look like an ink drawing on a white colored background. The white and gray aura around his black suit stimulated Susan’s eyes to look at him in a way that she hadn’t looked anyone before. Susan was the alpha of this office, and the man in front of her was contesting that, with his confidence and power pose.<br />
<br />
Susan approached the well dressed man from the side and when he made eye contact with Susan. Susan felt that he was judging her like a judge in a courtroom. She knew she hadn’t done anything wrong, but still, his eyes made Susan feel that she had done something irredeemable. Susan knew right away by looking at him that this individual meant trouble for her. The man didn’t say a word which forced Susan to introduce herself first to him. Susan felt offended that she had to do that. It had been a long time since Susan had to be the one to take the initiative for someone else. Usually Susan was the one who reacted to everybody around her as everybody else wanted to talk with her and not the other way around. The man lifted his eyeglasses from his nose and took his time to give any type of reaction to Susan’s introduction. <br />
<br />
The man placed the white coffee cup he held in his hand on to the table, lowered the eyeglasses back on his eyes and without standing up gave Susan a gentle greeting by nodding his head once. Susan asked from the man if she was able to join her and followed the question by asking from the man why he was drinking coffee at the cafeteria all by himself at this hour. There was no one at the cafeteria working or serving coffee to customers, so that meant that the man must have made the coffee all by himself. Susan looked at the man and the man said nothing. The man didn’t show signs of guilt that he had used Susan’s resources without her knowing about it. The coffee inside his cup was hers and he was consuming it without her permission. This made Susan seethe in anger. Who did this man thought he was. <br />
<br />
The man stared at Susan and she felt how his golden eyes behind the eyeglasses pierced Susan’s body and scanned her curves like if she was a well made clay sculpture in a museum. The eyes were penetrating Susan whole body but something stopped it. A familiar pulling sensation or what she could feel as a massive amount of growing warmth in her balls gave Susan more courage to fight against the intense stare. Susan felt that what ever was inside her balls was protecting her. The penetrating feeling stopped when the mysterious man lifted his cup from the table and took another sip from it before saying to Susan that he was waiting for the CEO of this company.<br />
<br />
Susan introduced herself once more, but emphasized the fact that she was the most important and biggest person in this company, and that there wasn’t anybody in higher position than she was. The man put his white gloved hand in front of his mouth and looked away. Susan felt frustrated. It was clear to Susan that the man wasn’t believing what Susan had told him.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. I’ve never seen a CEO of a company dressed such a, how should I put this, in such a casual manner. I beg my pardon if I rustled your jimmies but I thought you were nothing more than this building’s personal yoga instructor.” The man chuckled.<br />
<br />
Susan’s patience was running thin. The man had insulted her underhandedly and he had mocked Susan, who didn’t see any reason to follow a dress code in her own company. Susan was the dress code that everybody else followed. The crop top and yoga pants were considered to be the official dress code for Glendale&#39;s white collars and everybody knew this. She couldn’t believe how much this man was pushing Susan’s buttons by acting so smug and confident in front of her. But Susan calmed herself down as she knew that anyone who didn&#39;t live in Glendale would had come into the same conclusion as the man in front of her.  Susan had forgotten how the outside world functioned differently from Glendale. Based on what the man wore he could have been a CEO of a big company or a multi-millionaire who had more money than Susan could imagine. Susan gritted her teeth and kept her cool. She knew that the man was testing her. He wanted to see if Susan would lost her cool around him. Why would he make a deal with someone who couldn’t handle an insignificant and backhanded insult. Susan knew better that being calm and ignoring his comments was the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
“But now that I know who you are and what you value. Let me properly introduce myself. My name is Diavola Vil Ned Isguiz and I’ve come to your lovely Sultry Smiths to find you, Susan Smith. My last client and good friend Ophelia Jones told me that you’ve been the last person who visited her house. Is that correct?” The man explained to Susan.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I visited her. Was there something wrong with the free samples I gave her?” Susan pried from Mr. Isguiz.<br />
<br />
“Not at all, Miss Smith, not a all. Quite the opposite. My issue lies on the problem that my client used to contact me daily and from the day you visited them these important calls I had with her stopped. So I did what any reasonable ‘person’ would do and I investigated what had happened to my dear Ophelia and found that she couldn’t even remember me.” Isguiz said.<br />
<br />
“She didn’t remember you? Okay? How’s that an issue and why does it involve me?” Susan asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I can see now where the root of the problem lies Miss Smith. What an unfortunate tragedy this is indeed. My trusted client, pummeled, beaten and consumed like a fine meal. She is but an empty husk of her former self. That is why I came to visit you when my dear beloved Ophelia told me your name, but alas, I believe I’ve found my answer the moment I laid my eyes on you and there’s nothing I can do to save my beloved client.” Isguiz woe and swept his eyes with a white handkerchief.<br />
<br />
“I’m not quite following what you are talking about. Is Ophelia in danger? What do you mean when you say that &#39;you can’t do anything to save her?’ ” Susan said while she raised her eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I am deeply sorry Miss Susan that I cannot tell you more than what I’ve told you as it would break the unspoken code I swore to keep inside me. All I can tell you is that my brethren&#39;s cocoon is growing rapidly and their invisible tendrils are touching everything around it. Once said cocoon has consumed and stolen enough agency from others around it. They are ready to put their plan on second gear and fuse themselves with their host. In the worst case scenario the whole Glendale is doomed to live under it’s new ruler.” Isguiz explained to Susan when he stood up from his chair.<br />
<br />
“Cocoon? Agency? Unspoken code? And a ruler as in king? Are you some sort of poet or a religious person? I have no clue what you are saying.” Susan looked at the man while she felt a tingling in her balls.<br />
<br />
“Miss Smith, all I can do now is to wish you good luck on journey and if you ever get into a trouble.” The man coughed and pulled a black colored business card with red glossy and cursive text from his breast pocket and placed it on the table on it’s name side. “Here’s my personal calling card. It has my ‘number’ on it’s backside. Call me when the things don’t go the way you wanted.”<br />
<br />
When Susan tried to read the glossy red text on paper she couldn’t understand what she was reading. Susan lifted her head and noticed that the man had disappeared. Susan look behind her and felt odd how quietly the guy had left her eyesight. Susan sighed and placed the card she had just received between in his breasts for safekeeping. She then continued her check-up routine hoping that she wouldn’t come across with similar strange people that she just met.<br />
<br />
Susan stood up from her seat and went straight to her red convertible car at the parking lot under the building. On her way there the man’s words echoed inside her making Susan go through feelings she hadn’t felt in months. When was the last time when she felt like this. The man had made Susan so upset that she couldn’t insert the key properly to ignition switch. Once she got outside of the office building and begun her drive back home. Susan could feel how the insults were still haunting her and those meaningless words had poked a big button sized hole in her ego. Susan balls churned in response to her anger which made her negative emotions fizzle. Susan felt calm again and slowly forgot that she had even spoken with a man.<br />
<br />
On the next red lights Susan remembered how much of a hassle it was to drive from work back to home. Susan drove her convertible next to a free parking space on the street and made a call to the front desk with her company’s phone. Susan wasn’t too far away from the office building and there had to be someone in there who could act as her driver for the day. Susan let the phone ring for a long time until someone picked up the phone. She expected it to be the front desk worker Elizabeth but the voice and the way they spoke to Susan sounded different to how Elizabeth normally talked. Susan felt unsure who she was speaking with. The voice sounded fuzzy and static like if they were using a cheap microphone to speak with Susan. Susan politely asked from the voice who was at the other end of the line and voice said to her…</p>
