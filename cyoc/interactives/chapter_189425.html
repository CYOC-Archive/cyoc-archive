<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are Darren a father and bodybuilder who weighs 365 pounds, whose muscles bulged everywhere and who needed custom-made clothing. You also have a thick beard, and a very deep voice. You are shopping with your son, Conner, who at 10 years old was already quite well-built, standing 5&#39;4&quot; and weighing 140 pounds. The boy&#39;s muscles were very defined, especially his chest and arms, and he and you were looking for some shirts to fit him after his recent growth spurt. You were also looking to buy a belt for Conner, as you had a custom-fit belt that you really liked, but the price tag was a bit much for your budget. Your bodybuilding career had caused Conner&#39;s mom, your ex wife to divorce you recently, and so you were hoping this sudden growth spurt on Conner would allow him and you to get closer and enjoy your passion bodybuilding.<br />
<br />
A notifications alerts your phone and you see a new app has been installed. The app claims that it generates a random sentence about someone or place that is targeted and you can change one word in the sentence to make it a reality. <br />
You look over and see the muscular teen hunk shopping for stringer shirts. You point the phone at him and have the app target him. It generates a sentence: <br />
&quot;Alex is a teen hunk shopping for new shirts.&quot;<br />
You change the word &quot;shirts&quot; to &quot;underwear&quot; and the notification reads: <br />
&quot;Alex is a teen hunk shopping for new underwear.&quot;<br />
You glance up and are amazed to see that Alex is now looking at underwear to buy instead of shirts. He sees you looking at him and quickly averts his eyes, embarrassed. You quickly turn back to your phone and have the app target him again.<br />
&quot;Alex is a teen hunk who is embarrassed Darren saw him shopping for new underwear.&quot;<br />
You change the word embarrassed to &quot;excited&quot; and the notification changes to: <br />
&quot;Alex is a teen hunk who is excited Darren saw him shopping for new underwear.&quot;<br />
Shit. What did you just do? You look back up and sure enough, you see that Alex has now changed his focus to you. You also notice that Conner has wandered off and is looking at some pants.You target the teen hunk again and the app generates a new sentence. &quot;Alex is a teen hunk is excited Darren is noticing him.&quot; Feeling mischievous and also curious you decide to see how far you can change the teenager. <br />
<br />
You change the word excited to &quot;horny&quot; and the notification reads: <br />
&quot;Alex is a teen hunk who is horny Darren is noticing him.&quot;<br />
Huh. Well that&#39;s new. You didn&#39;t expect that. Wait, did you just fuck yourself over by changing the sentence to &quot;horny Darren is noticing him&quot; Fuck. You realize how attractive the teen hunk is now. You look back up to see that Alex has now noticed you and is walking over in your direction. Shit. You turn back around to your phone and have the app target him again.<br />
&quot;Alex is a horny teen hunk who is walking over to Darren.&quot;<br />
Fuck. You turn back around to watch Alex approach you with a smile on his face. <br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; he says, extending his hand out to you.<br />
Shit. He&#39;s so handsome, yet he knows you&#39;re older. <br />
You shake his hand and he says, &quot;I&#39;m Darren, and you&#39;re...?&quot;<br />
&quot;Alex. I&#39;m Alex.&quot;<br />
You fumble with your phone, the app generates a new sentence. &quot;Alex is a horny teen who is nervous about meeting Darren the sexy gay dad.&quot;<br />
In your confused state you quickly change the word &quot;meeting&quot; to &quot;chasing&quot; with out thinking of the consequences and the notification reads: <br />
&quot;Alex is a horny teen who is chasing after Darren the sexy gay dad.&quot; <br />
You notice a strong desire coming Alex&#39;s eyes as he looks at you.<br />
&quot;Me too. How long have you been lifting?&quot;<br />
&quot;Six months.&quot; He says.<br />
&quot;How long have you been... well, you know?&quot; You ask, trailing off.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always been attracted to guys.&quot;<br />
You nod your head. &quot;Me too.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have a nice build, you know?&quot;<br />
You frown. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
He smiles. &quot;You have a nice face underneath all that muscle.&quot;<br />
You blush. &quot;Uh..thanks.&quot;<br />
&quot;I like your beard.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
He continues to smile, and you feel your face warm up. This smile is starting to make you feel uneasy.<br />
You look over at your son Conner and tell Alex, &quot;That is my son over there, I am way to old for you....&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s young,&quot; Alex says.<br />
&quot;Exactly. I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m trying to take advantage of you or anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re not,&quot; Alex replies.<br />
&quot;You do?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
You continue to look over at Conner. He&#39;s still browsing through the clothes. You look back at Alex and feel your face flush a dark shade of red. You try to think of something to change the subject. &quot;So, are you good at lifting weights?&quot; you suddenly ask.<br />
&quot;I can deadlift 200 pounds,&quot; Alex boasts.<br />
&quot;Impressive!&quot; You say. Your hands quickly fumble with the app on the phone, it targets your son Conner. The sentence it generates says: <br />
&quot;Conner is a young bodybuilder shopping for new clothes.&quot; Not realizing you targeted Conner instead of Alex you change the word &quot;young&quot; to &quot;college&quot; and the notification changes to: <br />
&quot;Conner is a college bodybuilder shopping for new clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; you mumble under your breath as you just read the new sentence. You quickly glance up to see that Conner no longer is 10 years old but now looks like a college age bodybuilder, maybe even a few years older than the teen hunk Alex in front of you.<br />
You quickly look back down at your phone and have the app target Alex and yourself again.<br />
It generates the sentence: &quot;Darren the sexy bodybuilding dad is talking to Alex the teen hunk.&quot;<br />
You change the word &quot;talking to&quot; to &quot;flirting&quot; and the notification reads:<br />
&quot;Darren the sexy bodybuilding dad is flirting to Alex the teen hunk.&quot;<br />
Reality changes again, as you realize you have been flirting with Alex this whole time. You&#39;re a middle-aged man, who&#39;s been hitting on a high schooler.<br />
You blush, as you continue to eye-fuck him. He&#39;s got a nice body. You think to yourself. He&#39;s got a nice personality. He&#39;s respectful. He&#39;s a great conversationalist. He&#39;s a pretty decent looking guy.<br />
But he&#39;s a high schooler. How the hell are you supposed to take this kid seriously?<br />
You sigh, as you realize that you are in fact, attracted to him.<br />
Fuck it, you think to yourself. He&#39;s young and you&#39;re old.You target just Alex this time with the strange app. It generates a new sentence, &quot;This 17 year old teen hunk named Alex is flirting with a sexy 40 year old gay bodybuilder named Darren.&quot;<br />
You change 17 to 18 and the notification flashes &quot;This 18 year old teen hunk named Alex is now flirting with a sexy 40 year old gay bodybuilder named Darren.&quot;<br />
With that Alex is now legal age, you decide to get closer to him. He&#39;s attractive. You&#39;re attracted to him. It&#39;s time to try to make this relationship work.<br />
You ask Alex if he would like to feel your muscles.<br />
&quot;Uh...sure,&quot; he replies nervously.<br />
You look around, making eye contact with a few people. Nobody is giving you any funny looks, so you quickly start to feel Alex&#39;s muscles with your hands. You feel his strength immediately. He&#39;s a little on the smaller side, but you tell yourself it&#39;s just his age, he still has a lot of growing to do.<br />
Alex reaches for your massive muscular pecs. He grips them tightly.<br />
&quot;Man,&quot; he says, &quot;These are some of the best arms I&#39;ve felt in a really long time.&quot;<br />
You grin from ear to ear. &quot;You like?&quot; you ask, knowing damn well he&#39;s going to buy that line.<br />
&quot;I love,&quot; he smiles, &quot;A guy with a great personality and lots of energy.&quot;<br />
You grin again. &quot;You like how I can lift really heavy weights?&quot;<br />
&quot;I love how you&#39;re so muscular and big and manly looking,&quot; he says, &quot;but in a nice way.&quot;<br />
You feel your face get hot. Alex looks down at your crotch.<br />
You use your phone to generate a new sentence about Alex but target the whole store: &quot;All the people in this store are bodybuilders.&quot;</p>
