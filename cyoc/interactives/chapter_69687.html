<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week passed in a blur that left me more confused than ever. I had no idea who I was and where my place in the world was. My mind was still convinced that I was a Chihuahua bitch, which was really confusing because I appeared human, walked like a human and had the appearance of a human child.<br />
<br />
Squatting down to pee, the only way I was actually comfortable actually doing my business, I gazed down at the medallion that had at one time been attached to my collar, which had disappeared about four days ago. Having only this left to tie me to my previous life, I wonder what it was that changed me and if this odd thing in my paw had any connection to the life I had been suddenly thrust into.<br />
<br />
Finished, I stand and am about to start searching the nearby trash bins when suddenly a door opens a voice called, &quot;I knew somebody was going through the trash. Just never expected it to be a child,&quot; and lunging at me, the person stumbled over one of the trash bins.<br />
<br />
Backing away, I turn tail and run down the alley, the person who had come through the door chasing after. Turning a corner, finding myself in another alleyway, I here the person scream, &quot;Get back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I ran up the alley, I looked back to see how close the person chasing me was and promptly run into several trashcans. As both the bins and I spill over, I feel a tingling sensation go up my arm as I also feel the medallion slip from my fingers. Crying out a yelping noise, I lunge for the amulet as the person catches up and grabbing the back of the shirt I am wearing, screams out, &quot;You little pest. You've upset my garbage cans for the last time,&quot; and than began to drag me back toward the first set of trash bins that had been upset.<br />
<br />
Squirming, attempting to get free, letting out several high-pitched barks and growls, I have eyes for only retrieving the medallion. As I struggle, I am aware of the tingling sensation going through my body and dimly, I come to realise that I am changing again.<br />
<br />
And as the person who caught me dragged me around the corner, I whimpered one final time as I came to understand that my change this time was into the opposite sex, to which I thought, &quot;Well. At least I am one step closer to what I am supposed to be,&quot; missing more than ever my owner and the option to go about on four legs instead of two.<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;It's pretty,&quot; Jeff's sister exclaimed in response to her brother's comment.<br />
<br />
Watching his sister turn the amulet she had found a couple blocks back, Jeff sighed and didn't say anything, knowing it was rather pointless and that Angela wouldn't listen.<br />
<br />
Instead, he turned his mind to other issues. The most pressing was his mom's dire warning that when he got home from school today, he would be punished suitably for his actions. Actions, Jeff believed, he shouldn't be punished for. <br />
<br />
Like looking up a girl's dress because she had invited him to and at the age of ten and just becoming curious about girls, he agreed. Only to be caught by his mother and than have to listen as she bullied the girl into saying that Jeff had been the one to think of such a thing and that the girl was completely innocent in the whole matter, which Jeff had thought was bull-spit and had wished the girl had spoken up.<br />
<br />
Or how he had recently woken up and really needed to go to the bathroom and heading for the bathroom, he found his sister, who was four years younger than him, sitting naked on the toilet with the door wide open.<br />
<br />
And when his mother had come upstairs after Angela had begun to raise a ruckus, somehow putting her pyjamas back on in the process, she had taken Jeff's sister's side of the argument after Angela had calmly lied and said that Jeff had been trying to peek in on her while she was using the potty.<br />
<br />
Than there was the incident yesterday when Jeff had found Angela's doll lying in his room. Upset that his sister couldn't stay out of his room, he'd lost his temper and taking the doll, he twisted its head off, took it down the hall to Angela's room and was just about to toss it in when he spied Angela playing with her other dolls. And the moment she saw Jeff holding the head and body of one of her dolls, she had begun to throw a fit, twisting the heads off of several other dolls as she did so.<br />
<br />
When their mother had come to investigate, naturally she took Angela's side and hauling Jeff back to his room, she hissed out, &quot;You're in big trouble, mister. You're grounded, to start with. And as soon as I have some time to think, you can certainly expect a bigger punishment.&quot; Something she had threatened to deliver on as soon as he came home from school a day later.<br />
<br />
Sighing, wondering what else his mother had in store for him as punishment, he cast a surreptitious glance at Angela and thought, &quot;Spoiled brat,&quot; as he decided that this was real crummy was for the summer holiday to begin.<br />
<br />
Home, his mother immediately told Angela to go play, to which she did without complaint, but came back a couple seconds later, asking about another bed in her room.<br />
<br />
Gazing at Jeff, their mother simply stated, &quot;You'll find out soon enough. Now. Go play,&quot; as she Angela disappeared to her room, their mother grasped Jeff by the arm and stating, &quot;Young man, you are going to learn the importance of treating girl's with the proper respect,&quot; as she dragged him upstairs.<br />
<br />
In the upstairs bathroom, she closed the door and began running the bath water. Looking at Jeff, she simply said, &quot;Strip,&quot; cutting him off as he was about to say something.<br />
<br />
Figuring now was not the time to argue, Jeff complied. Afterward, he was told to get in the tub, now filled with the bubble bath Angela used when taking a bath. When he did so, his mother began to scrub him with shampoo and body wash Angela used, all the while muttering under her breath.<br />
<br />
After he had been cleaned, he was told to get out and smelling like his sister, Jeff stood there, shivering as his mother dried him off. Telling him, &quot;You will do as I say, do you understand,&quot; she reached over to the sink and picking up a bottle next to a pile of clothes Jeff just noticed, she began to rub the some of the contents all over him as Jeff merely nodded, wondering what it was his mother was planning.<br />
<br />
When she was satisfied with how much she had rubbed whatever it was she was rubbing on him, Jeff watched as she set the bottle on the sink and reached for the pile of clothes. Suddenly realising that they were clothes for a little girl, Jeff listened in silently horror as his mother told, &quot;For the next three days you shall dress, act and be treated like a girl. To be more specific, a girl of five years old. You will be Angela's little sister and anything she wants to do with you, whether it be dress-up pretend or playing in the kiddie pool, you will do it. If you refuse, you will be expected to be Angela's little sister for longer. Do you understand, young lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
Realising what his mother had just called him, Jeff nodded as his mother handed him a pair of yellow underwear with pink ducks on it. Pulling it on, he stopped as his mother made a tutting noise and barely hearing her, he listened as she said, &quot;Little girl's do not have that unsightly bulge. Tuck it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff, horrified and near tears, complied as his mother handed him a pair of purplish-white tights and pulling them on, he stared down in mute horror at how flat the front of the tights looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step,&quot; his mother said and looking, he saw that she was holding a dress.<br />
<br />
Doing as she commanded, Jeff thought and wished that he could either die or sink into the floor as his mother zipped up the back of the dress, which Jeff noted was white, but had a floral print on the lower part of the dress and the part of the dress that looked like suspenders going over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look very pretty,&quot; his mother said as she fastened a ribbon to his hair and than stood him before the mirror.<br />
<br />
Gazing at his reflection, Jeff didn't know which was worse. The fact that his mother had actually dressed him as a girl or the fact that he looked a little like Angela. And than his mother said, &quot;And now we practice some of the basics, such as walking and holding yourself,&quot; as she turned him away from the mirror and led him out of the bathroom and downstairs to the living room.</p>
