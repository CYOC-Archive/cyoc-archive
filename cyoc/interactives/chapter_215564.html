<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean was alway a fan of punk rock music and thought about trying a new style now since was too afraid to back when he younger. With this machine he could go full punk while still remaining feminine with the chance to change back at anytime he wanted. So through the use of the multiple settings that Sean found he was able to craft the perfect woman in his mind while also adding a few add-ons to help boost the experience. Once everything was done Sean quickly got the full body mirror his roommate Jay owes and removed his clothes until he was nude to get the best possible view of his transformation. He then quickly returned to the Chronivac where he hit enter on the program he had ready.<br />
<br />
The first change Sean felt was in his groin, his balls built a pressure where they began dig there way through to their new position turning into ovaries as they went the tunnels they carved becoming the framework for the fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina cana. The empty scrotum then started to morph to the surface of the new slit Sean had forming the labia of his new gender, at the same time his penis shrunk into a nub that turned into a clitrois. As Sean’s new female reproductive system finished forming something in “his” mind felt strange Sean could no longer refer to “himself” in masculine terms she found herself only able to see herself as feminine. At first Sean found this a bit disconcerting but considering everything else that was happening she decided to put that aside for now. Next change was Sean’s hips as they popped into a wider stance more fitting to her new sex this lead to increase in size of her ass forming a nice large tone rear causing her thighs to gain mass leading to her calves and feet becoming slimmer and longer. By the time transformation was moving above her hips she had a stunning pair of muscular, long, feminine legs which Sean thought look badass. As Sean was admiring her new legs she suddenly lost her breathe as her ribs, shoulders and waist were all squeezing into a new strong compact shape causing her organs to rearrange a bit hence the lost of breathe. After that small scare Sean found herself standing at a now more diminished 5’9” but her more muscular frame was more than worthy trade off as she felt far more stronger and powerful than in her male form which was easily seen in the muscle tone that was in her torso now which then continued to grow into her arms as they turned into a pair of slim, hard appendages with firm and thin hands. Sean was very impressed with her stature so far but felt something was missing until a burgeoning sensation was building in her pecs which Sean knew exactly what that meant and her missing feature. Sean brought her hands to her chest as her breast tissue started to develop massaging them as they grew, playing with her nipples as the areolae expanded in size and the nerves grew more sensitive. Once they stopped growing Sean had a nice set of firm, pert D-cup sized breasts which finished the final touches of her new womanly torso which may not have had been the ideal hourglass shape most people strive for but for her it was strong, sexy, tough and a whole lot more practical than those toothpicks on runways. It was at this point Sean realized she truly was a woman now her mind may have started referring itself as female in the beginning but it was hard to believe that with a flat chest, narrow hips and wide shoulders but now the only male part of her left was her head which she thought was not long for this world as she felt her Adam’s apple sink into her throat leaving  only a smooth neck. The first change to her head was to her jaw as what could count for facial hair vanish which then lead to a restructure of her skull all the most prominent masculine features all the rough hard edges smoothing out into more rounded edges, the large nose and brow shrinking into smaller shapes and eyes changing from a dull brown to a brilliant emerald green while also appearing more round and larger in the new face. Once the change finished Sean saw one kick ass face staring at her although most of Sean’s previous face was erased some elements still remained in a lessen fashion giving her a more stern and butch face with constant serious demeanor or resting bitch face as it was called, what she liked most was her new haircut. Instead of the bland short brown mop she used to have she now sported a magnificent long hair faux Mohawk the end of which just licked the top of her back it was dyed a beautiful Neon green and blue the braid of the Mohawk forming a cross pattern with it’s colors. Soon after all natural portions of her body finished transforming she started feeling stinging pricks over certain parts of her body where they stung a chrome piercing was left after the pricks stopped she took a count of her new jewelry finding a nice naval ring, piercings through both nipples, a tongue stud, a septum ring, a pair of piercings through her left eyebrow and several types of earrings all of which Sean thought were cool as hell. After admiring her chrome for a second she then felt a stinging all across her skin as color ink started absorbing into detailed tattoos. The first one to complete itself was a spiral of barb wire along her left calf, next a beautiful purple rose with the words “Punk Metal Love“ on the petals on right upper thigh, then on her right forearm a dark colored viper wrapped around from wrist to elbow, on her opposite forearm the word warrior listed in multiple different languages, once her limb tats finished a new series of body art formed on her torso starting with a Polynesian style shark on her right side, paralleling the right a spectacular image of a screaming female wraith and to finish the set a giant fiery Phoenix sprawled across her back with the wings reaching into her arms the head drawn on the back of her neck. Sean loved ever design displayed on her skin.<br />
<br />
As Sean examine her body new memories started to sprout in her mind an identity that belong to the body she now inhabit. Then a name came to her one she typed into the Chronivac one that didn’t feel like her’s but now feels like it couldn’t be anything else, her name is Ember Strauss. She is a 20 year old bisexual lead guitarist/singer of her own band the Steel Banshees, an all female punk rock group that was showing lots of local success. Ember could remember it all while still retaining her memories of Sean. After posing in front of the mirror for a while Ember decided to find some clothes to see the full extent of her new style finding the discarded clothes having turned into her new garb. First to come was a matching black bra and panty set which expertly put on, next Ember got the pair of black tight leather pants with a chain belt which she easily slip on, then she found a pair of spike military boots that use to be Sean’s sneakers, she then placed on a frayed white crop top with her band logo on the front that exposed her naval, after that she found a pair of leather spiked bracelets that for comfortable on her wrists which matched perfectly with a torn denim vest with all her favorite band pins that Ember soon found to put on completing her wardrobe for the day. As Ember slide into her vest she had entered the bathroom where she found the last element to finish her punk rock style, her make-up. Starting with her hands she added a cool pitch black nail polish to her fingernails, then went to add the same color lipstick and maybe went a little heavy with the eye shadow and eyeliner finally completing Ember Strauss. <br />
<br />
Once Ember felt she had finished she left the bathroom to notice a few changes to her apartment she belonging that use to be Sean changing to fit her punk lifestyle, posters of her favorite bands on the walls, flyers for her band appearances and most importantly her pride and joy a beautiful electric guitar which she uses to help write all her music. At that moment she decided to try and finish a piece she been working on for the last year to be the next leading single for her band’s first tour. After a few hours of song writing Ember was just about to finish her masterpiece when the front door slammed open and her roommates Jay and Dan came barreling in causing Ember to lose her train of thought. “Oh look the bitch is here” Jay said, “Oh what is the uncivilized harlot doing now” replied Dan. Back when Sean was a guy he found Jay and Dean online for his roommate ad but failed to do a full check not knowing the true Jay and Dan until it was too late. Jay was a gym rat who thought he was God’s gift to women he would hit on any girl with a heartbeat which exactly happened to Ember until she beat him in arm wrestling contest at a bar in front of his gym buds and if their was one thing Jay loved more than sleeping around it was his pride, now nether one can stand the other. Dan was a rich kid that cut off the tabloids caught him doing one too many prostitutes, he thought himself a high culture socialite when in reality he was just a spoiled brat, he and Ember disliked each other immediately he thought her a uncouth troublemaker and she thought him an elitist asshole. “What do you shit heads want” Ember asked “I thought you were suppose to be gone for the entire day”. Jay answered with a sly nod “The bar just doesn’t know when people are just having a good time”. More like they hit on too many women and were asked to leave but not before the bouncer intervene if the bruise on Jay’s jaw has anything to say thought Ember to which she retorted with “Well can you at least keep quiet I’m trying to finish my new song”. Dan chuckle a little before saying “Like you could call that noise music”. At that notion Ember retreated back to her room with her guitar, sheet music and the Chronivac, once in her bedroom she thought how she could teach her roommates a lesson then looked at the machine that gave her this life.</p>
