<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha felt quite lucky as she and Frances drove home, with Lila Carpenter following behind in her car. Lila was more than willing to help with Agent Green&#39;s transformation so that he could be with his wife in every way, and that proved to be good news for all involved. It made Samantha&#39;s work easier and would keep Agent Green alive, since the werecat strain of the were-virus, be it the true werecats that were all female or male werecats, had a bad habit of killing any normal of the opposite gender. If Marci Green WAS a werecat, being gay or bi would be the least of Theodore Green&#39;s problems if they went ahead with anything on their own. As Town Chancellor, with responsibilities to welcome new residents and wherever possible ease their transition into were society, Samantha had to make sure that things like that didn&#39;t happen. Thankfully, Lila was willing to help, and took care of the first hurdle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you&#39;ve also told the Greens about the taxi company to take?&quot; Frances asked her Samantha pulled into the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they know which to go to and to have them come straight here,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;The big thing is to make sure that the guest room is ready and things are relatively quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we send Ben to Kenya&#39;s?&quot; Frances asked with a semi-suspicious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he wants to,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;You know Ben. If he doesn&#39;t want to go, he IS mature enough not to cause trouble. Shoot... how many times have WE enjoyed each other&#39;s company when he was home and he didn&#39;t come into our bedroom. We&#39;ll just need to talk with him about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just checking,&quot; Frances said with a small smile as she turned to see Lila come up to park on the street, &quot;And at least with this way we won&#39;t be having to deal with any more bits of unwanted excitement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;tonight would be a night that love conquers all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two have something special planned?&quot; came a voice from behind them.<br />
<br />
They turned to see Martha slowly approaching and looking rather curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was just bringing out some garbage from the kitchen and I saw you and wanted to say hi, and as I came over...&quot; Martha began, &quot;I saw you had a guest and got curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who is this?&quot; Lila asked as she approached and with a tone of interest that Martha did detect.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is our neighbor, Martha Anderson,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;Martha, this is Lila Carpenter. She works with me at City Hall and we&#39;re arranging something special for a man so that he can be with his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... pleased to meet you,&quot; Martha held out a hand.<br />
<br />
Lila took it and shook it eagerly, &quot;Anderson...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My family moved here before the school year started,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;My husband was jumped by the rogue and Samantha and Frances were more than willing give me my welcome to were society.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lila nodded as she remembered the incident in which a college professor had been jumped by a werefox student in the college parking lot. Though if became a werecat, that had to mean that this woman was already bi, which on some level interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like they did a very good job,&quot; Lila answered as she looked Martha down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she did turn out quite well,&quot; Frances said with a smile, &quot;and has turned out to be a great pride mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we are busy and have a fair amount to do,&quot; Samantha said to Martha, &quot;as much as we&#39;d love for some fun... or even just to hang out, we have some work to do to get ready for the arrival of of the man we&#39;re supposed to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who knows... perhaps we&#39;ll run into each other somewhere else in town,&quot; Lila said to Martha, her tone clearly indicating some interest in brown haired werecat, giving Martha some indication Lila was at least bi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but I don&#39;t want to keep you,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and Samantha, Frances... if you need anything brought over... give me a call. I&#39;ll bring it right over.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Martha turned to head back to the Anderson house and return to getting dinner. She felt quite pleased with the attention Lila delivered to her, though more for Kat&#39;s sake than her own. Getting access to her cream might fun, and even more so if she would be okay with William being there with both of them, but Martha also knew that Kat was single a weretiger, like Lila. And from what Martha had found out so far, Kat hadn&#39;t had much lasting luck with regard to romance. Many of the smaller weres, according to Kat, seemed to fear she would hurt them because of her larger size. Martha knew that wouldn&#39;t apply in every case, particularly as Kat had been quite gentle and tender with her, but proving that to others could be difficult. If Lila was at least bi and single, which Martha suspected based on the attention that Lila had given her and the fact that the Twists were using her to transform someone into a weretiger, there might be some opportunity to set Kat up with Lila.<br />
<br />
&quot;A good neighbor you have,&quot; Lila said to Samantha and Frances as she watched Martha head back to the Anderson house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she is,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;but we have work we need to get done...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Samantha lead the way while Frances and Lila were quick to follow. They entered the house to find Ben waiting for them in the living room. It appeared as though he was just hanging up his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, moms,&quot; Ben answered as he heard them enter and then glanced to see Lila following along behind, &quot;Discussing next year&#39;s budget already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Samantha shook her head, &quot;A person is on his way here who is looking to be become a were and looking join were society to join his wife, and has chosen to be a weretiger, but Lila is the only weretiger willing to do the transformation. And since she doesn&#39;t have the room to do the transformation where she lives and has a thing against hotels, we will allow her to use our guest room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to go out and spend the night with Kenya,&quot; Frances picked up, &quot;that&#39;ll be fine with us... so long as you remember that you have school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben gave something of a smile and headed to his room. The three adult women stood quietly for a few moments before Ben appeared again, this time with his backpack. It looked a bit more stuffed full than it had before Samantha and Frances returned home, but they didn&#39;t know that. He then began to make his way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your way should be clear,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;Just be careful of Lila&#39;s car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben nodded and headed out. Frances saw him pull out his cellphone as he headed out. Lila followed him for a moment or two and then turned back to Samantha and Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... who&#39;s Kenya?&quot; Lila asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A college student who moved here during the summer to be with her Uncle and Aunt,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and has seemed rather nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re letting her rob the cradle?&quot; Lila teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben is hardly a little kid anymore, Lila,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and it won&#39;t be too long before he&#39;s a legal adult. And she has been respectful to us and has treated Ben right so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As such we have nothing we feel we need to fear,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;if something does go wrong... we expect Ben to act with the maturity he&#39;s shown over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lila then chuckled and nodded. The Twist family had come to its fair share of social functions at City Hall that Lila had been able to get some glimpses of Ben Twist as he grew up from time to time. She thought he had turned out quite well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully he turns out well,&quot; Lila spoke, &quot;In the meantime, while I&#39;m waiting for the guest of honor... do you have place I can set my purse down?&quot;</p>
