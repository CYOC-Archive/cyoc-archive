<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry for being away. Besides writer’s block, I’ve had enough to deal with, elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
Apologies – but I want to sidestep Rachael. Epona has the whole of Earth to choose suitable horses and humans from, to balance out the sexes in the new colony. What if she chose some people from another culture entirely? People who are desperate to escape their lives more than Rachael…?<br/>
<br/>
This may or may not be my last chapter for this story. At least for now... But I want to thank the other writers who worked on it - both before and during my participation! It&#39;s been hard work - but satisfying, too.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Extract from Lucy’s diary:<br />
<br />
It’s now the beginning of Skiraphorion. The equivalent of mid-June. The mustangs who became centaurs on the fifth night since the first humans and horses arrived here, have now formed their partnerships and mated – becoming fully centaur in mind and spirit. Thunder’s sister, Fatima, paired up with Francisco; Hazel with Kismet, Anna with Kyle, that Jamaican-ethnic flirt – Bonita – snagged Shadowfax for her own, and Magnolia fully embraced mare-hood after her mating with Cinnamon. That just leaves Spirit, after there was some jockeying between a few of the stallions to secure a mare. But our goddess helped out by channelling my ex-horse, Lightning, telling us that she’d managed to open a portal and send through two more humans and their horse.<br />
<br />
But there were some different this time. Although the humans had agreed to be transported to our new world by Epona – it had been a quick decision in a moment of crisis, we were told. Also, the god mischievous Fate had intervened and sent the three arrivals to a village on the nearby coast. He wanted us to travel further from Chiron’s Grove than we had before. Also, the new trio were all female. Epona told us, in church, that one of the arrivals would need to be turned into a male, in order to restore the even balance between the sexes. And…they did not speak English – though Epona informed us that she would use her magic so that the latest arrivals would start to understand English after they had slept their first night in their new world. In time for a scout party to find and greet them, before taking them back to Chiron’s Grove.<br />
<br />
Luke and Snow had been looking forward to the prospect of racing along a beach for some time. And I liked the idea too. So I asked Ben if he would like a trip to the coast. <br />
<br />
“Definitely. So long as it’s with you, Luce,” he told me, smiling. “But what about Cindy and Tim?”<br />
<br />
“How about they both come with us?” I put to him, smiling. “Luke and Snow have also noticed the friendship between those kids. And it would be good for them to explore their new world. And after all, this is a designated weekend – so they won’t miss school if we’re back soon.”<br />
<br />
So, after our goddess had delivered us the news, the six of us quickly had breakfast and prepared ourselves as a scout party. Spirit asked to join us – as he was keen to see the new female arrivals for himself, given his single status. And we happily brought him along.<br />
<br />
It took some time to track the new arrivals down in one of the coast villages – a village that bore the sign of Hylonome’s Haven. Then we had to coax the two women down from the rooftop of the bungalow that they had climbed onto, after we had found their horse. Luckily, Epona’s magic had already got to work upon them, and they were starting to understand the English language, to their surprise. Gulpari and Zainab turned out to be a pair of Afghan ladies, aged in their twenties. They feared that we were demons at first – but the respect that we treated them and their white Qatgani-bred horse, Qudsia, softened their resistance to us. They weren’t pleased to discover that Luke, Ben and I were originally humans from the USA, though – given how the mistakes of our recent administrations, on both sides of the political divide, had led to the Taliban seizing power again in their country. Only for their regime to break their promises, and then go onto robbing the women of their rights to education, and generally treating them as third-rate citizens. And it got so bad that Gupari and Zainab had tried to escape their country with their horse – with the Taliban hunting them down, after the women had broken into a shop overnight, to top up their supplies. Whilst hiding in an abandoned building, our goddess had opened up a portal and spoken to the ladies in their language – offering them a permanent haven for them and their horse. Fearing death if their pursuers caught them – Gupari and Zainab had accepted. Then they found themselves teleported to Hylonome’s Haven, along with their steed.<br />
<br />
“Most of the people in your county… They don’t know about what we have to suffer. They don’t care!”  Zainab scoffed. “They only see what they want to see in the world – and they don’t look very far!”<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately, you have a point there,” I sighed. “But our nationalities from birth…? They don’t matter anyone. We are centaurs now – not humans.”<br />
<br />
“We are one united colony – regardless of whether we are human-born, or horse-born,” Spirit agreed. “I was a horse until recently. And soon, both of you will join our herd also. It is inevitable.” He patted Qudsia affectionately, and smiled at her. “And your beautiful horse will become a centaur also.”<br />
<br />
Qudsia snorted and turned her attention to him, inhaling Spirit’s scent. Her tail twitched, showing potential interest in him…<br />
<br />
“What? We will become…like you? Cent-taurs?” Gulpari squeaked. “The radiant lady said something of this – but I did not believe her…”<br />
<br />
“It is true. And I was the first to be transformed out of our colony,” Snow told them, smiling reassuringly. And so, between us, we told the two humans what their fate would be. Including that one of their trio would need to become male, so that the colony would be evenly-split between male and female. At this point, Gulpari and Zainab shared a wide-eyed look at each other. But they didn’t panic or protest.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay! Both Cindy and I love being centaurs!” Tim piped up. “So do the rest of us foals. And the adults seem to like it.”<br />
<br />
“We’re faster and stronger than we were as humans,” Cindy agreed. “Our senses are so keen! This world is fresh, green, and peaceful. I no longer mind leaving Earth behind. There’s so many problems back there.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I no longer wanna be a racing driver or a computer games designer!” Tim added. “I wanna be the fastest sprinter in our class! And I know that Jeremy – one of the other colts – he wants to be the best hedge jumper of all of us.”<br />
<br />
“And I want to be an explorer of our new world!” Cindy beamed. “There’s so much to discover.”<br />
<br />
Ben and I shared a proud smile over Cindy. And we could see Luke and Snow looked fondly at Tim.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the pair of Muslim ladies assented to join us on the return journey to Chiron’s Grove – to give them the best chance of survival, as part of our expanding colony. But before we headed back, Luke and Snow spend some time exploring and racing each other along the coastline cliffs and sandy beach, under the sunny sky. They took Tim and Cindy with them for the experience too. Whilst they did so, we found out from Gupari and Zainab that aside from living on the supplies they had on them when they had travelled to our world, the ladies had used the fishing nets in the village to catch some fish in the village stream, before cooking them over their makeshift fire.<br />
<br />
Ben nodded with approval. “We should fish from our own village stream with these nets, after we get back home. But only take a sensible number of fish. We mustn’t over-farm anything.” <br />
<br />
When Luke, Snow, Tim, and Cindy headed back to Hylonome’s Haven, to take over watch over the new arrivals from us – Ben and I decided to wander off and soak up the spray as well, as we cantered, then sprinted along the beach. After that, we found a spot at the end of the sandy strip that was shielded from view by a clump of rocks. I caught sight of Ben’s furred sheath twitching and I grinned, before stepping closer and taking his hand.<br />
<br />
“Lucy, I…,” Ben breathed, blushing. My took a moment to brush my hair as it moved in the sea-breeze – using the moment to calm himself. “Um, I want to.... Right now. You’re the one that I want. The one I need…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes. Indeed… You have my permission, Ben,” I told him. “This place is perfect for us to mate. Our first time was by the village stream. Now we can experience lovemaking besides the sea…”<br />
<br />
Ben smiled, and took my hands in his as we faced each other. “I am so lucky to have you as my mare, Lucy. My lovely Lipizzaner. You are beautiful, caring, and so thoughtful.”<br />
<br />
“And you are too, Ben… Well, handsome – rather than beautiful… B-but just like me on the other points,” I started to stutter. “And you’re the one that I want. The one I need. Always…”<br />
<br />
Ben smiled and silenced me by cupping my face and kissing me on the lips. Slowly. Lovingly. His eyes smouldered with desire. He had once been a shy young man. Now he was a confident centaur stallion. But he is never cocky. <br />
<br />
We started our dance of love, our hands and lips exploring each other. After we had removed our tunics and shirts, Ben paused to remove the scrunchie that was holding my blonde-brown hair in a pony tail. Now my long tresses draped over my shoulders and my mane – the ends of two strands tickling my areolas. Ben rubbed his fingers lightly around the edge of my exposed breasts, before bent down to kiss and lick my areolas – making me gasp with pleasure, even as my hands explored his abs and other toned muscles underneath his human skin before moving onto lovingly brushing his mane and brown equine fur. Together, we teased each other’s sensitive spots – our necks, the small of our backs, then me moving onto holding and rubbing his furry sack, making Ben whinny with delight. In turn, Ben tickled my equine udder and finally moved to arouse my privates – making me neigh out loud as his fingers, then tongue, flicked my clitoris.<br />
<br />
I panted, grinning. I knew that my entrance was now clearly moist to his eyes. I twitched my tail – my seventh limb – to one side as I braced my hands against a pillar of rock. “Go ahead, my stud,” I teased Ben, turning my head to flash him one of my winning smiles.<br />
<br />
He grinned back. Ben gave a snort like the horse he physically half was as he positioned himself and coiled his muscles. Then, I saw him rear up upon his back legs and slam down upon my equine croup and loin. Now facing forwards again, I held myself firm under his weight as Ben pushed himself forward – his forehooves locking around my equine chest from both left and right. The malehood of my Trakehner centaur soon found its target and slid into my quivering vagina, making me whinny with pleasure.<br />
<br />
We both love it when we bring out the animal in each other. It turns Ben on. It excites and turns me on. And that inner animal for the two of us is a horse. Of course. <br />
<br />
Having practiced a few times since our first mating, we soon rediscovered our joint rhythm as Ben thrusted and I counter-thrusted in time. With his hands squeezing my breasts once more, Ben bent forward to kiss my mane and neck – making me snicker and moan as I reached back with one arm, to cup his neck and brush his mane again. Gradually, our tempo increased. My vaginal muscles squeezed hard to extract as much of Ben’s gift – his centaur sperm - as possible, as he inched himself in further. The flattened tip of his phallus reaching my cervix, making me giddy with delight.<br />
<br />
“You’re warm. You feel so good, Lucy…,” Ben gasped, finding his voice again after we’d been going at it for a while.<br />
<br />
“You feel so good too, Ben, I’m…getting there,” I panted. “Keep it coming! Oooh… Oooh. Oooh!” And as we both managed to climax together, our human cries turned into neighs and whinnies of delight…<br />
<br />
Minutes later, after uncoupling ourselves and recovering, we both took a dip in the churning waves of the sea. Just far out enough for it to wash our equine parts and spray our upper bodies. Then it was back to the beach, to redress ourselves and hold hands as we squatted down on our hooves and looked out upon the ocean, soaking in the sounds of the waves and gulls, and feel the sunshine, sea spray and gentle breeze. Feeling the sand underneath our shooed hooves. I leaned my head against Ben’s. I now had my scrunchie safely in a pocket of my tunic, letting my damp hair slowly dry out.<br />
<br />
“This is perfect, Luce. Thank you. I won’t forget this. Ever,” Ben told me, his arm now around my shoulder as his lips formed a wide smile.<br />
<br />
“Nor will I, Ben. Thank you.” I beamed back at him. After a minute, I sighed and broke skin contact with my wonderful mate. “Well… We better get our new guests back to Chiron’s Grove before they transform. I guess it’ll be the horse that becomes a stallion…”<br />
<br />
Ben had a twinkle in his eye. “I won’t be so sure, Luce. When it was just us pair watching over Gupari and Zainab – and you headed off to keep guard over Gupari when she needed to relieve herself… Well, I asked Zainab about her life. She told me that both her and Gupari have fled from their overbearing families. And that Gupari is the only person she cares about – besides looking after their horse, Qudsia. Then Zainab asked me what it was like to be a male centaur…”<br />
<br />
I gave Ben a scrutinising look, thinking as I spoke again. “Those ladies didn’t panic or protest when we told them that one of their party would become male. In fact, they are both dressed as Afghan men that I’ve seen on the TV news. Not as the women who I’ve also seen…”<br />
<br />
He nodded. “Exactly. I wonder if Gupari and Zainab are in love with each other…” He trailed off as a sensation struck him. I felt it too, a whisper in my mind from our goddess – and I squeezed Ben’s hand, letting him know I was sharing in the moment too.<br />
<br />
“Epona just confirmed it for us both… That is part of the reason she chose them, out of all the people and horses she could’ve picked across the world,” I gushed. “Gupari is secretly Zainab’s bisexual lover – and Zainab is a lesbian, who’s now wondering if she can become male!” <br />
<br />
“Leaving Qudsia and Spirit to become another couple, if they are both willing and up for it…! Looks like our colony is going to achieve a perfect balance once again,” Ben laughed out loud. “Let’s get back to the others, Lucy.”<br />
<br />
“You know that Snow and Luke will see your spent balls…,” I muttered, my lips fluttering. “Probably Tim too. Maybe Cindy.”<br />
<br />
Ben shrugged. “Can’t be helped, when we love each other so much, Lucy!”<br />
<br />
And so, with us both taking in the perfect scenery one last time, Ben and I rose and trotted back to our adopted daughter and the rest of our party – ready to head back home. To rejoin our friends and our thriving colony.</p>
