<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They all gathered at the longhouse for the evening meal, Sara and Jack saving spots for their late arrival friends. After a few minutes, the group entered the longhouse, long after the rest had entered. While the side dishes were already on the table, taunting the students, none would eat until all were present and the main entrees were brought out. <br />
&quot;So what happened after I left,&quot; asked Sara excitedly as Vect sat down across from her.<br />
He seemed far away, deep in thought.<br />
&quot;Most of the others got their animal part, me and 4 others didn&#39;t,&quot; said Lelu sadly.<br />
&quot;And Gratz explained how we can prepare for our &#39;merging day&#39; as he put it.  Clearing your head, meditation, that kind of stuff,&quot; continued Beverly as she knelt down, not having to use a chair as her horse part was tall enough for her to reach the table laying down. <br />
&quot;Hey tell em what your spirit is,&quot; smiled Carl.<br />
Beverly narrowed her eyes at him and ground her teeth slightly in agitation, &quot;I swear I&#39;m going to trample you.&quot; She sighed looking down, &quot;I got a unicorn&#39;s horn. Carl seems to think it&#39;s funny.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on, it is funny! A tomboy like you getting, what might as well be the most girly magical creature in the world,&quot; he held up his taloned hands to defend himself from Beverly&#39;s punch, still laughing the whole time.<br />
&quot;And what did you get Carl,&quot; asked Jack.<br />
Carl shrugged, &quot;Gratz called it a... Peryton feather? Yeah that sounds right. No idea what that is though.&quot;<br />
Lelu started smiling, as did Vect slightly. <br />
&quot;And what about you Vect? What was in that bag?&quot;<br />
Vect looked up, &quot;a red dragon heart.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, I definitely know what that is. Yeah no wonder you are a bit nervous,&quot; said Jack.<br />
Vector shook his head, &quot;that&#39;s not entirely it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what?&quot;<br />
&quot;The other 8 that got chosen were....&quot; Beverly listed off 7 others that were chosen and their spirit.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s only 7, what about number 8,&quot; asked Jack.<br />
&quot;The last one was Salazar Ortega.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok now it makes sense,&quot; said Jack as he looked over at the giant sitting on the other side of the longhouse. His light brown skin covered in scars from past fights. He may have been a first year at the BTC but he had spent the previous 6 years training at the other fighters classes. He only came here looking for a proper challenge, this was probably why he had been bullying the others, trying to get a rise out of them. Vect had seemed to catch his eye when he started to surpass some of the students and novice teachers.<br />
&quot;His spirit is a green dragon heart, I know he is going to want to fight me after the joining,&quot; said Vect.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s still a week off at least. Plenty of time to prepare. Anything else happen,&quot; asked Sara, trying to change the subject. <br />
&quot;Gratz, said that the more powerful druids can shift form into their spirit&#39;s original form. I guess Bev won&#39;t change too much,&quot; said Carl.<br />
&quot;Oh you&#39;ll get your&#39;s Carl. Karen&#39;s a bitch,&quot; simmered Beverly.<br />
&quot;Ok ok I&#39;ll stop. Main dish is being brought out now anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feast proceeded as usual. Afterwards, Jack pulled Lelu aside. &quot;Hey Jack what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Lelu, think you are an incredible person.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pretty amazing yourself,&quot; replied Lelu, glancing at Jack&#39;s well muscled chest for a second.<br />
&quot;And I wanted to give you something special. I made this for you,&quot; Jack handed her the package he had behind his back. <br />
She slowly undid the knot and unfolded the wrapping, nearly dropping it when she saw the bracers. &quot;Jack thank you! These are beautiful! Help me get them on please.&quot;<br />
After donning the bracers, Lelu ran through her hand to hand drills, throwing a few experimental punches and kicks followed by open palmed strikes. After trying out some hand motions for some higher level spells she walked back to Jack and threw her arms around his neck, careful not to skewer him on the spikes, and planted a kiss full on his lips. Stunned for a moment, Jack wrapped his own hands around her waist as they kissed. After a few minutes, Lelu pulled away. She walked away from Jack, swaying her hips seductively as she did, turned and beckoned him to follow. Jack followed her to the bathhouse. As they entered Jack shut the door and turned to see Lelu dropping her deer skin vest to the ground,  and turn to Jack. No one would be coming into the bathhouse after dinner as everyone bathed before dinner as a rule. While the camp seemed primitive on the outside, inside the buildings were more modern like the bathhouse with its mosaic lined pool they used for a public bath, runes lined the edge to cleanse the water of and dirt and grime. Jack&#39;s member was pressing hard against the cloth loincloth under his fur skirt. &quot;You might want to take those off,&quot; suggested Jack motioning to the bracers.<br />
Lelu quickly took them off and set them on her vest, turning to see Jack drop his skirt. She ran to him and lept up into his arms, wrapping her arms around his neck, and legs around his waist kissing him passionately. Jack&#39;s member rubber her through his loincloth as she ground against him. Their clothes were discarded quickly as Jack groped her firm breasts, and she rubbed his swollen sack. <br />
She led him by the hand into the water never breaking eye contact. Jack sat on one of the steps, chest above the water, and Lelu lowered herself down onto him slowly, breathing in sharply as the head spread her lips wider. She lifted off him slightly then lowered again, sliding further down than before, her thick muscled legs picking up the pace slowly.<br />
Jack latched on to one of her breasts and began to suck on it, using his tounge to tease the nipple, his hands grabbing her butt and helping lift her up.  One more lift and then she had managed to put his entire 8 inch length inside her. After that she began rocking back and forth, stirring the water as she did. She was getting close and if the expression Jack was making was a hint, so was he. &quot;Get ready. On the count of 3 I&#39;ll pull out ok?&quot; Jack nodded, gritting his teeth. &quot;Ok. One.&quot; Jack&#39;s cock was throbbing so much. &quot;Two.&quot; Lelu&#39;s breathing had reached a point nearing hyperventilating. &quot;Three.&quot; Lelu used her thick muscled to pull off Jack just as he let his cum errupt out of him. Lelu nearly lost her footing as she climaxed. They lay in each other&#39;s arms out side the pool for the next hour. &quot;We should do this more often,&quot; said Lelu as she dressed.<br />
&quot;Agreed. Is this yours?&quot;</p>
