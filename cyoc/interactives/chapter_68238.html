<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean was helpless as the caretaker looked him over. His smooth round body felt just like his normal skin <br />
would, though all his features were simply printed on as if tattooed on the skin ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let's get this down to size&quot; the Caretaker said with a grin as he fumbled under the table before pulling <br />
up what looked like a bike pump. Dean could only look straight ahead, his eye's having no ability to move as <br />
he watched as the pump's pin push into and through his skin with a slight hiss and a stitch of pain.<br />
<br />
The Caretaker slowly pulled up on the handle of the pump and Dean found a sucking sensation coming from within <br />
him. The ball begun to get smaller, though not deflating but shrinking! Dean watched as his surroundings got <br />
bigger as the skin ball's features started to change. While the ball got smaller, it's features did not. To <br />
Dean it felt like he was being crushed on all sides, though his shocked expression never changed. More and <br />
more his face, palms, feet bottoms, and cock took up more surface area.<br />
<br />
The Caretaker smiled happily as he watched the Dean ball get down to a much more usable size; about the size <br />
of a basket ball. Across the front of it was a lifesize rendition of Dean's dick and sac proudly displayed for <br />
all to see. On either side of the skin ball were the palms of his hands, the bottom showed the soles of his <br />
feet, and the back of the ball showed off his nice round printed on ass. It look almost as if Dean had been <br />
crushed into some type of plastic sphere, his body crumpled up like play-doh on the inside. But running your <br />
hand of the Dean ball you wouldn't feel plastic at all but Dean's smooth supple skin without any kind of <br />
wrinkle or bump.<br />
<br />
As the Caretaker lifted him up Adam and Sam found their way to the room. He turned to the two and smiled <br />
&quot;You're just in time to test your friend&quot; he said coyly as he tossed the ball to Adam.<br />
<br />
Adam caught the ball and looked puzzled at the Caretaker. Looking down at the strange texture of the ball he <br />
and Adam begun to turn it around. Dean wished they'd stop, he skin now extra sensitive as a ball their feeling <br />
hands driving him wild though no release would come to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...this thing looks like Dean&quot; Sam muttered to Adam before it finally dawned on them. It was Dean! Adam <br />
looked up at the Caretaker as he pressed the ball to his crotch, both in shock and also to hide his <br />
embarrassing hard-on he was sporting at the idea of Dean being a ball. Dean could only stare straight ahead as <br />
he felt Adam/s tented pants push against his smooth face.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how did you do this to him?&quot; Adam asked, a blush spreading across his cheeks. The Caretaker smiled as he <br />
approached the two. He gently lifted Dean from Adam's hands and set him aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like you wouldn't mind being in the same predicament as your friend hmm?&quot; He said, nodding to both <br />
of them. Adam and Sam looked at each other for a few seconds before Sam nodded slowly. Adam couldn't believe <br />
it and felt relief as he too admitted to finding the idea of being reduced to a simple sphere erotic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well how about you two strip down and we'll get you all set up like your friend Dean here hmm? We'll start <br />
with him first!&quot; The Caretaker said as he pointed to Sam. Both stripped down fast and clumsy, both their dicks <br />
hard as rocks as the Caretaker approached Sam. Taking the the same pump he had used on Dean he gently pushed <br />
it into Sam's naval, the slight pain of it going in making Sam wince slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we want some varieties in our skin balls, so don't expect to look like the other ball&quot; The Caretaker said <br />
as he gently pulled up the pump handle. At once Sam started to shiver and moan as he leaned against the wall. <br />
The more the pump handle rose Sam started to wrinkle, deflating as he sagged to the ground. He mumbled <br />
incoherently as Adam watched his friend being reduced so much. Sam's head slowly sucked down into his neck, <br />
which was sucking down into his chest, his limp empty limbs also pulling into him as he got smaller. Even his <br />
cock and sac were pulled into the empty sac of skin he was rapidly becoming. When the Caretaker was happy with <br />
the size the deflated heap of skin was, he started to pump the handle downward.<br />
<br />
Dean faced the wrong way, unable to do anything but listen to what was happening as a new skin ball was slowly <br />
taking form. This one also had a printed, almost tattoo look of features on it but it was different than the <br />
Dean ball. Adam watched wide eyed as the ball inflated more until it was tight and the same size as Dean. On <br />
the front of the ball was a complete rendition of Sam's chest and abs that took up almost the entire surface <br />
of the ball, the back side of it had only minute details of the indentation of what was a rendition of his <br />
spine and shoulder bones. Everything else was simply not there.<br />
<br />
The Caretaker reached down and lifted the Sam ball, removing the pin from it, the hole from the pump instantly <br />
sealing itself closed as if it never existed. Sam could feel the hands feeling over his smooth skin surface. <br />
It was driving him wild but he could do nothing about it, with out anyway to see or move or talk, all the <br />
sounds coming to him muffled though still audible. The Caretaker again reached under the table and brought out <br />
what looked like a large mag-light flash light. He flick it on and started going up and down around the Same <br />
ball, the light part of flash light pressed flush to it's skin. As the flash light traveled around Adam <br />
watched as the areas it was pressed to darkened to a nice, even tan leaving the ball looking as if whoever it <br />
had been spent quite a few days at the beach.<br />
<br />
The Caretaker smiled as he sat the new ball beside the other one. Dean couldn't believe the ball he was <br />
looking at was Sam. It was even more reduced to a simple sphere than he was! The Caretaker pressed the pin <br />
into Adam before he could get any second ideas. Again the pump handle was pulled up and Adam's body shivered <br />
in pleasure. His knees wobbled and collapsed on themselves as he wrinkled and emptied. His limbs and head were <br />
pulled into his chest but even his chest and stomach started to curl in on themselves. When Adam was reduced <br />
to a heap like Sam he grinned.<br />
<br />
Reaching down he felt around till he felt Adam's deflated dick. Start to rub and pleasure it he begun to push <br />
down on the pump handle. Slowly a new ball begun to inflate. As it did Adam felt the Caretaker jack him off <br />
faster and faster. Just as his cock and sac were about to be pulled into simply being a printed on rendition <br />
he cam. The Caretaker removed his hand as he smiled and lifted the ball. The front of this one came out <br />
perfect. It showed the top of what were Adam's thighs and his sac. The underside of his rock-hard cock was <br />
visible and it was organising, thick white strands of seed part of the pattern. The Caretaker turned the ball <br />
over, the backside simply Adam's tight ass as he chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You all came out perfect&quot; he said softly...</p>
