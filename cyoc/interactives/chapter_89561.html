<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You whirled around to a lone man there, and he was clearly a man. He was fairly tall, broad-shouldered, though not really muscular. In fact, even with his broad shoulders, he looked rather frail. His skin hung tight to his skull and created a rather gaunt appearance. His eyes also seemed to be sunken into his face, and to further give his face a rather skull like appearance, it looked as though he&#39;d shaved his head. You beat your wings and moved back so that you were closer to Tulipelle and that Sandra was between this man and you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you...?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who am I?&quot; the man gave a chuckle, &quot;I am a savior! A hero!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hero?!&quot; Sandra snorted, &quot;You&#39;re upsetting the balance and ruined my day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like your day mattered compared to my mission,&quot; the man answered, and you thought you heard Sandra almost growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;This portal is unstable,&quot; Tulipelle spoke, &quot;and the barriers between Gaia and Earth are breaking down...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man only smiled and nodded. He wasn&#39;t denying anything and seemed to be playing everything he was doing as a good thing. You weren&#39;t smart enough with magic to really know the full dangers of this yet, but based on what Queen Rafflesianna&#39;s enchantresses had said, what Tulipelle had said, and what Sandra had said, you knew enough that things could be dangerous if they continued. But something about this man was rather creepy, and it wasn&#39;t just what he said. It was also in what he wore. Sandra being a witch was a surprise, but she generally seemed to be much the same as you remembered her being, and the clothing she was wearing, while black in color, was fairly normal. This guy was decked out in what you were sure came out of something like World of Warcraft or some other fantasy game.<br />
<br />
He wore a long purple robe with a gold metal belt. The robe had padded shoulder guards made him look like he was wearing some specialized and pointed body armor. Its sleeves were wide and spacious and hung loose over his arms. He could have a whole bunch of things hidden in his sleeves and we wouldn&#39;t know it until after he pulled out his weapon. He also had a heavy gold chain around his neck which had a large ruby hanging from it. It was all crazy, though you didn&#39;t want to admit that because much of what you thought of as &quot;normal&quot; couldn&#39;t be justified given the wings on your back and the fact that you were most decidedly a girl now was more than enough to know that your old definitions of &quot;normal&quot; no longer mattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And will bring about the world that is desired!&quot; the man, whom you assumed was a warlock of some kind, spoke, &quot;one world!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to be,&quot; Tulipelle answered, holding her wand defensively, almost as if it was a sword, &quot;Our magic isn&#39;t supposed to run wild in the human world... just as human magic isn&#39;t supposed run wild in ours...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said anything about it running wild?&quot; the warlock answered, &quot;all of this is controlled!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with chaos magic it isn&#39;t!&quot; Sandra argued, &quot;It&#39;s very nature at least implies a lack of control...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man raised a hand and lightning suddenly erupted from his fingers and hit Sandra in the chest. Her book was sent flying off to a side and she was sent flying backward. She gave a scream of pain as she flew through the air and hit a far wall of the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra!&quot; you called in surprise and horror.<br />
<br />
She shook her head slowly and let her eyes open, and at first her frown and narrowed eyes looked very much like Sandra wanted to kick the guy&#39;s butt. After a few moments, her eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Iris, look out!&quot; she called to you.<br />
<br />
You looked over your shoulder and saw the warlock turning his hand, which seemed to still be smoking after shocking Sandra. Terrified, you tried to fly up and get protection from Tulipelle. You had magic, but you were still adjusting and learning. It was doubtful you could cast any spells. The warlock didn&#39;t send lightning at you. Instead what seemed to come out of hand was a sort of net, made out of strands of black bands of energy, which spread out wide and caught both you and Tulipelle in it. Its weight was enough to take both of you to the ground at Sandra&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaos magic works when applies the right amount of power,&quot; the warlock said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;At what cost? I bet your own magic&#39;s been eating at you thanks to using chaos magic!&quot; Sandra spoke in warning, sounding calm but still firm.<br />
<br />
&quot;But once the world&#39;s merge... none of us will have to hide... belief in magic will be restored, and the world will make me a king for doing it,&quot; the warlock spoke calmly, &quot;and I have the power to do it... and wouldn&#39;t you want that... to be able to be who and what you are without fear of someone running away screaming...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans believed in Fairies in the middle ages...&quot; Tulipelle spoke in warning, &quot;that belief was not one that treated fairies well... Dark fairies trying to use dark magic kidnapped children at times for their purposes and humans attributed that to all fairies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And witch hunters decimated multiple covens, killing good witches/warlocks and bad witches/warlocks,&quot; Sandra added, &quot;Mostly in the assumption that all we practice is &quot;black magic&quot; which isn&#39;t true...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will change that,&quot; the warlock smiled, &quot;I have the power to change that. There will be one world and that world will respect me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re insane,&quot; you accused as you sat in the net that you and Tulipelle were trapped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they say,&quot; the warlock answered with the laugh, &quot;that doesn&#39;t make them right.&quot;</p>
