<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, is it always this exciting around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now turned, a befuddled look on his face as he gazed at Nat. The dhamphir sporting a sly grin as she eyeballed the teen. &quot;Um yeah kinda,&quot; he replied, drawing a small chuckle from the woman. &quot;The more things change the more they stay the same,&quot; she sighed. Darren simply raised an eyebrow, now curious about Nat. &quot;I&#39;m guessing this kinda thing is routine then,&quot; he said. &quot;You know for a spy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually working for the CIA was kind of quiet,&quot; she said. &quot;High school and college was a completely different story. That and when I worked for S.P.E.A.R.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S.P.E.A.R?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strategic Paranormal Enforcement and Rescue,&quot; Nat stated. &quot;Its a small agency within the government that monitors supernatural activity. I spent alot of years working there as Director. We monitored the various supernatural races that I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of. Lately, they&#39;ve been helping refugees settle on Apollo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now balked, if Nat knew about the supernatural, maybe she had knowledge on the Normal? &quot;Wait does that mean you know about the Normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry not really,&quot; Nat sighed. &quot;They&#39;re really good at keeping their secrets and I&#39;ve been out of the loop for too long. I do know they used to go by the One Humanity but that was decades ago now. What I do know is that we had some evidence they were the ones responsible for the genocide of several magical races. That&#39;s why we moved the survivors to Apollo secretly to keep then safe. No one, knows about them and we want to keep it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Darren said softly. &quot;Still, anything you know would be helpful. I&#39;ve...had several run ins with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;re lucky to be alive kid,&quot; Nat muttered. &quot;And I&#39;m being serious about that. They&#39;re leader simply goes by the Boss. No one knows his name but we think  it&#39;s a generational title passed down by the previous leader. I&#39;ve read the field reports, seen the photos, and talked with the survivors. Those guys are the most efficient killers I&#39;ve ever seen. They would leave only a handful of survivors when they were done, so little that it essentially wiped those races off the map. Take my advice, be careful when dealing with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren simply nodded, studying Nat carefully as she spoke. Obviously the dhamphir had been spooked by her limited dealings with the Normal but the information she did have aligned with what he knew. Thanking Nat the group now turned to explore the town, only to find Fukushu blocking their path. &quot;Can I help you,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
Fukushu furrowed his brow, carefully studying the woman before him. &quot;You say that Akira trained you,&quot; he stated. &quot;Taught you the ways of our warriors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that correct,&quot; Nat replied. &quot;Is that a problem?&quot; Fukushu furrowed his brow, folding his arms across his chest. &quot;It is a surprise that&#39;s all,&quot; he said. &quot;Our people rarely teach outsiders our ways. Stranger still how I was unaware of this fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both know Akira wasn&#39;t exactly a social butterfly,&quot; Nat smirked. &quot;He&#39;s pretty good at keeping secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And protecting those he cares about,&quot; Fukushu added. &quot;I&#39;ve heard of you Natalia MacGregor yet, we never met. Akira was quite adept at keeping you safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably for the best,&quot; Nat replied sternly. &quot;Because I&#39;ve heard about you too. I know all about what you did to the wizards in my hometown. I knew them, you could say I admired them. Even if they just saw me as their children&#39;s babysitter.&quot;<br />
<br />
A half smile now cracked across the kitsunes face. Darren unsure what Fukushu was thinking. There was tension between the pair that much was certain. Fukushu now gazed at the group, turning as he now called to the others. &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren, Nat, and his friends now followed the nine tail as he led then towards the palace. As they walked,  the teen could see numerous kitsune offering him a polite wave or warm smile as they passed. Darren was still adjusting to being a celebrity amongst the supernatural, returning their waves but feeling just a bit awkward in doing so. As they approached the palace, Darren was surprised as they now turned left.<br />
<br />
Darren had never been to this part of town. Studying the area, Darren could see that this appeared to be where the kitaune militia resided. The teen could see small barracks housing kitsune ranging from teenage two tails to more stern and grizzled looking seven tails. Right now Darren noted militaristic kitsune dressed in uniform training, exercising, or going about their duties. As they passed, Darren noted these kitsune pause in their activities, bowing as he and Fukushu now passed by. &quot;What is this,&quot; Hannah asked, the teenage Soul Drive cocking her robotic monkey head in curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of our training bases for the kitsune army,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;I helped in establishing it centuries ago after spending sometime in the human world. I realized if our armies were to remain relevant we needed to adapt. Over the centuries I introduced several reforms to make our people the most highly trained and fearsome army in all the realms.&quot; As the group continued, Darren could see a wall with two large wooden doors, as Fukushu now pushed the heavy doors open, Darren beheld a rather interesting sight.<br />
<br />
Before the group they could now see what appeared to be a small arena. Darren noted a small grandstand on one side covered by a wooden awning with a small observation deck above that. The arena itself was a rather large square about 80 feet in diameter. Finally on the other side,  Darren noted several wooden weapon racks all sporting various training weights and equipment. As the group descended a stone staircase, Fukushu beckoned the others towards the grandstand as he guided Nat towards the arena.<br />
<br />
As Nat and Fukushu now stood in the middle of the square, he studied the woman carefully. &quot;I trained your master in this very arena,&quot; he stated. &quot;If you are his best student then I wish to see what my pupil has taught you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat smirked, rolling up the sleeves of her blouse as she assumed a defensive stance. &quot;So you want to fight,&quot; Nat asked. Fukushu smirked, assuming a stance of his own as he sized up his competition. &quot;I&#39;m just curious how much Akira has taught you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now watched anxiously as the two fighters approached one another. During his own training with both Fukushu and Akira he had felt himself pushed to his limits. Although still a novice, he was interested in how a more seasoned fighter would do. From what he had seen so far, Fukushu&#39;s skill was frightening.<br />
<br />
The fight started in a straight forward manner, Darren watching as the duo exchanged a series of punches and kicks. Each attack was successfully blocked and countered, neither opponent able to land a blow so far. Fukushu smirked, appreciating the obvious time Nat had put into honing her skills. Akira had obviously taught her well, yet he wanted to see just how skilled she was.<br />
<br />
Another series of attacks put Nat on the defensive, the dhamphirs speed and strength tested by the nine tailed kitsune. Now though, Fukushu decided to press the attack. With just a thought his tails now lashed out, Fukushu surprised at first as the dhamphir deflected successfully. Soon enough though he was able to ensnare the womans ankle, knocking her to the floor.<br />
<br />
Leaping back to her feet, Nat wiped her mouth as she now grinned at the nine tailed kitsune. &quot;Didn&#39;t realize you wanted to bring our powers into this,&quot; she grinned. &quot;I thought you wanted to test my skills?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I am sure Akira has told you our abilities are more than just what we know,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;In battle you must use all of your natural abilities to defeat your foe.&quot; Nat chuckled, once more assuming a defensive stance as she stared down Fukushu. &quot;Okay your funeral.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now watched as Nat&#39;s features began to shift.  The dhamphirs eyes taking on a pinkish hue as her muscles seemed to swell under her clothing. The womans face shifting, becoming feral in appearance as a set of fangs appeared. Fukushu smirked, readying himself for the attack.<br />
<br />
As Nat moved to attack, both Darren and Fukushu were surprised by what they saw. The dhamphir moved faster than either thought possible, almost appearing to teleport as she looked to strike. Fukushu blocked the initial attacks, his eyes going wide on his vulpine face. As he now countered, both were shocked as the blow past through her. Somehow Nat had transformed into mist instantly, appearing behind Fukushu as she swept his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAD!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu shook his head, clearing it as he found himself sprawled upon the mat. He had heard of vampires assuming corporeal form but it was a skill few had. Obviously Nat appeared to mastered this transformation to be able to perform it so quickly. Glancing into the stands, the kitsune now noted the look of concern on his son&#39;s face. The black and red kit appearing nervous as his father lay on the mat. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he called, leaping back to his feet as he now gazed at his grinning opponent. &quot;Impressive, I&#39;ve known few vampires that have mastered that technique.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you said,&quot; Nat grinned. &quot;You need to embrace your abilities. Akira always told me, my powers don&#39;t make me a monster. It&#39;s how I use them that defines me.&quot; Fukushu nodded, standing before the dhamphir woman with a small smirk. With a flick of one of his tails, he watched Nat assume a defensive pose, only for the tail to appear behind her from a portal that instantly popped into existence and sweep her legs. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat frowned dusting herself off as Fukushu reached down to help her up. A small smile on her face as Fukushu assisted her to her feet. &quot;Neat trick,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Never saw Akira do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I taught him everything he knows,&quot; Fukushu grinned. &quot;Not everything I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
As thr pair now bowed to one another, Darren couldn&#39;t help but appreciate their skill.</p>
