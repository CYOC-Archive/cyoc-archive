<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan was given Jen&#39;s old room when she was still a human maid. And after a tour of the house, and being introduced to Jen, she had decided to call it a day, so she could begin early in the morning. Jen, who was left alone in her closet, realized that before she could &quot;upgrade&quot; Susan, there was one important thing left for her to take care of. All of her spare body parts and internal organs, along with various pieces of vaccuum and power washer were still scattered around her room. This wasn&#39;t good. <br />
<br />
She figured that the pieces of the leftover appliances could just be tossed away. But her organs and various body parts were something she had to make sure didn&#39;t get lost or disposed of, or she would never be able to get her body back. A simple solution was quickly thought of though. She could just put them all into a bag, which would hang off of her, similar to how the appliances had bags for their loose parts. <br />
<br />
To fix this, she first pulled of her ears, reattaching them to her shoulders. She then unhooked her small hoop earings that she had been wearing, and pushed them into her earlobes on thsir sides, making a ring similar to how some people gauged their ears, except hers was entirely made of skin with a very thin gold band along the inside, keeping the shape. Grappbing the loose parts bags from the vacuum and power washer, she emptied their contents, and placed all of her own parts inside them. She luckily managed to filled them both up while still being able to close them. Lastly, she clipped them onto her literal ear rings. They were not 100% full, so she tossed in some of the loose attachments for the other appliances as well. <br />
<br />
Now that that was taken care of, she rolled her way over to Susan&#39;s bedroom. Susan had always been an incredibly heavy sleeper. So she knew no matter what she did to her, she likely wouldn&#39;t wake up. As she rolled up to her bed, she paused a moment when she saw the jewelry box on the nightstand, curious, she opened it and found it full of various piercings. One however caught her attention. It was a 1 inch in diameter golden navel ring. She had always wanted to get her belly button pierced. Grabbing the ring, Jen went to put it on. But first, removed her belly button. With her bellybutton in her hand, she pushed it out, making her innie now an outie. She returned her bellybutton and slipped the piercing into place. She gave it a gental tug, and to her surprise, her entire torso from just above her intake hose to under her boobs pulled off, like it was ment to be removable. She realized that it was in fact meant to be removable so that she could empty her womb when she was full. Putting her lower front panel (as she guessed it now was considered to be) back on, she continued to approach Susan. <br />
<br />
Gently, she pucked her former friend up and dragged her to the adjacent bathroom. First she pulled off the toilet from the wall, setting it down next to Susan. She the removed Susan&#39;s arms and legs, as well as her clothing, pussy, ass, and clit. <br />
<br />
First, Jen placed the now limbless Susan onto the pipe in the floor, shoving it up her asshole. She also fed the intake up her ass too.  Next Jen took her pussy and stretched it across the toilet bowl&#39;s opening. The insides becomming vaginal walls, and her cervix became the drain. Her womb she guessed had become the internal water tank. Pulling the pussy bowl off of the toilet, she reattached it to Susan. Now Jen put her clit onto the nozzle of the bidet, making a small hole appear on its top. <br />
<br />
Likeing her work so far, Jen then grabbed Susan&#39;s thighs. She placed them in a way that they surrounded her pussy creating the toilet seat. She then took the flush lever, and  used it to replaced Susans nose, with it pointing downwards by default. <br />
<br />
Moving on to the next part, Jen removed Susan&#39;s hands from her arms,  and replaced them with the toilet brush, and paper roll holder. She then stuck the arms onto Susan&#39;s hips. Finally she took what remained of her legs (basically her calfs and feet) and stuck them upside down ontop of her now lower shoulders, with her left foot on her right shoulder and vice versa, making a pair of foot shaped armrests. <br />
<br />
After doing a few minor adjustments, like making sure Susan&#39;s breasts are pushed forward creating a comfortable back rest, and that her head tilts slightly back, so her handle isnt in the way of her users, Jen was satisfied with her work. All that was left was to being the unused water reservoir to the trash. <br />
<br />
The next morning, Susan awoke to her new body, however she didn&#39;t think it was any different than before. She still had her brush, her flush lever, her clit nozzle. Her bowl was filled up a few inches from her permanently wet pussy like always. Yep she was still a toilet girl. She had flet like doing just a small bit of morning cleaning of herself, but before she could start, Martha entered the room. <br />
<br />
Moving over to Susan, Martha sleepily pulled down her panties, and took a seat on Susan&#39;s thighs. Susan&#39;s quietly enjoyed the pressure on her seat. She loved being used. Every moment was pure bliss for her. From the pressure on her seat, to Martha leaning back on her boob shaped back cushions, to the feeling of her pee steadily flowing down, collecting into the cum pool she always had in her pussy. However she was waiting for the next 2 actions. The cleaning of Martha and then the flush. <br />
<br />
Noting Martha had finished peeing, Susan extended her clit out. She then preceded to squirted all over Martha&#39;s pussy, with the feeling being literally orgasmic. After a few seconds, she stopped and retracted her clit. Reaching down with her left arm, she gently wiped Martha&#39;s pussy dry with her special toilet paper attachment. Once she was dry, Martha got up and flicked Susan&#39;s flush lever. This caused her womb to contract rapidly pushing out every drop of water she stored inside of it. The water (which is now her cum) emptied out into her pussy bowl through her urethra, before flowing down into her cervix and finally out her asshole. All the while Susan was screaming in orgasmic pleasure. Lastly, just before Martha left, Susan called out to her. &quot;Have a wonderful day Mistress, and once again, thank you for allowing me to help you relieve yourself. I will always be willing to help you in that reguard, so please do not hesitate to use me again.&quot; It was part of her contract to say these lines after every use, reguardless of who was actually using her.<br />
<br />
Jen had heard it all from inside her closet, which shared the same wall Susan was mounted on. She loved what she did, and couldn&#39;t wait to do it to the new replacement maid tonight. But who, and eventually what, will they be, she wondered?</p>
