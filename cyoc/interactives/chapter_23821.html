<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody and Ty were walking down the street where Ty’s house was located, when they passed in front of a large two story house, which had a large van parked in the driveway.<br />
<br />
“Look, Ty! That’s where Yoshi lives!” Cody pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Well… Not for long! Look, they’re moving!”<br />
<br />
Ty and Cody stood in front of the house and watched, as Yoshi and his father slowly carried the heavy sofa out of the house, via the front door.<br />
<br />
Yoshi, and his sister and parents originally came from Okinawa, Japan, and they were living in the Orlando area for awhile, where Ty lived. But, his dad was being transferred to Seattle, where he got a job working for a large computer software company, and they were busy packing their stuff and loading furniture into the large U-Haul van, so they could drive to California that night.<br />
<br />
Ty felt sad that Yoshi was leaving, since he was always nice to Ty. However, neither Yoshi nor his parents were very tall, and Ty pondered what to do. He felt the need to reward Yoshi for his two years of kindness which he had always shown Ty and Dustin at school, and it seemed like this was Ty’s golden opportunity to make an impact.<br />
<br />
“Hi Yoshi!” Cody and Ty called out to their Japanese friend. <br />
<br />
Yoshi came over to greet them, and he was followed by his father, named Matsu Yamamoto.<br />
<br />
“Hi, Mr. Yamamoto! I’m Ty… and this is Cody. I live down the street, in that house over there…” Ty said, while he pointed to his house, which was three blocks away, on that same street. “I see you’re moving today?”<br />
<br />
“Greetings, Ty-san and Cody-san!” Mr. Yamamoto said. “yes, we’re trying to get everything packed and loaded on the truck, but it’s a lot of work and we’re just the two of us!”<br />
<br />
Cody and Ty turned to face each other, and they both had wide grins on their faces. Then, Cody pulled Ty towards him, just as Yoshi and his dad walked back into the house.<br />
<br />
Cody whispered something in Ty’s ear, and Ty nodded after he heard what Cody had to say.<br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes and concentrated on the Japanese family, and he wished for Yoshi and his dad to come out and stand before him. Suddenly, both of them popped up out of nowhere, and were standing right before Cody and Ty, side by side! But, neither could say anything, because they were frozen!<br />
<br />
“You know something? Most Japanese people I know aren’t the tallest people around. I’ve never met a Japanese kid, who was bigger than his father…” Cody pointed out to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’ve met some tall Japanese guys before, but Yoshi isn’t one of them!” Ty laughed, as he stared at his Japanese classmate. <br />
<br />
“Let’s help him out!” Cody suggested.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t much of a challenge to Ty. Yoshi was only 5’3” and his father was just 5’6” tall. So, there wasn’t much difference.<br />
<br />
“Let’s make Yoshi big and strong!” Ty chuckled, as he stared at the two frozen men.<br />
<br />
“Make him… make him bigger than his dad! And… much stronger!” Cody added.<br />
<br />
“Well, if it’s going to be a dramatic change like that, then I’ll need to make it so that nobody will find it strange that Yoshi has become so big, and everyone will find it to be very normal!” Ty replied. “So, here goes!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the short, skinny Japanese boy started to grow. Since he was only wearing shorts and no shirt or shoes, Cody and Ty were able to observe his growth to the greatest detail.<br />
<br />
Yoshi first started to grow taller and taller. His arms grew longer, as well as his legs, pushing his waist further from the ground. His legs grew thicker as well, and his torso also stretch out while his body widened slightly. His neck even grew longer, and his shoulders widened as he continued to grow. Finally, his hands and feet were enlarged, and Ty made sure that they were a little on the big side, intentionally!<br />
<br />
When Yoshi reached a height of about 6 feet tall, Ty allowed the growth to stop, because he didn’t want him to be that much bigger than his dad. However, he was big enough, and he towered over his dad by at least 6 inches.<br />
<br />
“Awesome!” Cody cheered. “Now, add the muscle!”<br />
<br />
“Roger that, mate!” Ty chuckled in reply. He stared at the tall, Japanese boy, while he made his second wish in silence.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Yoshi’s tall but skinny frame began to fill out rapidly. His arms began to bulge as biceps, triceps, and forearms began to inflate with impressive muscles. His legs grew even thicker, as layers of muscle started to form over the front and sides of his legs, widening them as muscle grew under the long veins. His flat stomach began to show abdominal muscles, which began to rise up from the skinny torso, which seemed to grow like fresh bread, which was baking in the oven. Yoshi’s torso was now ripped with rock-solid muscle, as his body widened even more. <br />
<br />
His shoulders grew wider again, as mighty lats formed underneath, in order to provide support and to give the defined V-form, which all bodybuilders craved. Yoshio was looking very impressive already! But, Ty wasn’t quite finished changing him yet.<br />
<br />
Finally, Ty decided to give Yoshi the finishing touches that would give him that bodybuilder-look and size, with the added physical strength as a big bonus. Yoshi’s legs inflated like balloons, and he grew astounding calves, like those of professional soccer players. Lastly, Yoshi’s pectorals grew into large spheres of muscle, allowing his upper-body strength to be increased many times over.<br />
<br />
“They’re moving to California, so I got to make sure that he’ll make a big impression when he heads for the beaches!” Ty grinned, as he watched the final changes as they took place.<br />
<br />
“Awesome! I guess you’re done, now?” Cody wondered.<br />
<br />
“One more thing…” Ty said, with his eyes closed. “I don’t want his father to freak out, when he realizes how big I made his son…”<br />
<br />
Ty made one last wish, so that everyone would accept Yoshi as a kid, who spent a lot of time working out in the gym. <br />
<br />
“I want to make sure that it’ll be easy for him to add to his muscles, whenever he starts to go to a gym to work out. His muscles will grow very easily!”<br />
<br />
When Ty opened his eyes, he quickly snapped his fingers, which allowed Yoshi and his dad to move once again.<br />
<br />
“We’d better get the dining table, dad!” Yoshi cheered.<br />
<br />
“I’m coming, son… I need to take a short break…”<br />
<br />
Yoshi’s dad was panting from exhaustion, and Ty noticed that. But, Yoshi now had so much more energy than before, so he turned around and walked into the house by himself. Moments later, the big, Japanese boy came walking out of the house, while carrying the entire dining table on his back, and barely straining in the process.<br />
<br />
“Watch out, son! That’s much too heavy for you! You can’t carry that all by yourself! You’ll hurt your back!” his dad said to him, with a touch of concern.<br />
<br />
“No sweat, dad! That’s what I got these huge muscles for, see?” Yoshi replied.<br />
<br />
He then set the dining table on the front lawn, so that he could walk up to his father, who now had to look up to his taller, bigger, and muscular son.<br />
<br />
“Look, dad! I’m strong!” Yoshi grinned, as he made a fist with his right hand, and then flexed his arm. A large ball of muscle, almost the size of a brick, rose up from the top of his thick arm.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Hercules… Let’s finish loading up the truck!” his dad ordered.<br />
<br />
“Sure, dad…”<br />
<br />
Cody and Ty just watches, as the realized how easy it had now become, for their Japanese classmate to load the truck with all the remaining boxes and furniture. It was a snap for Yoshi, who happily used his increased size and his huge muscles, to impress his dad with one strength feat after the other. The boy almost single-handedly loaded all the furniture in the truck all by himself!<br />
<br />
When Cody and Ty saw that they were no longer needed, they said their goodbyes to Yoshi, before they continued to stroll down the street. Both boys were glad to see how their power had helped a good friend, and they were wondering what they could do next, where they could go, and who they could help and grow a little.<br />
<br />
“I know, Ty!” Cody cheered. “Let’s go to…”</p>
