<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the fateful day, a week and a half later, police escorts arrived to make sure that Elle and steve went to their local regeneration clinic. Both were nervous, both held onto each others hands. They knew that they probably would never see each other the way they currently look again. It was a short cab ride, maybe 5 or 10 minutes, but it was a part of town that they never visit... the farmlands, rich with all its grain and cattle roaming the fields. Some looked happy, some stayed alone, but steve only wondered how many of them were once human, and how many of them value their old lives. He knew that if he survived 10 years, the act was supposed to have a provision promising return from the program, but he also knew that many wont survive 10 years. After all, he's only going to be assigned the position of a bull used for meet. <br />
<br />
They turned through the letters they were given, with the brochures and information on each of the regeneration clinic's practices. Neither of them really gave it much look, both were too preoccupied with saying their farewells to their family, who promised to visit them every week. <br />
<br />
Elle opened the pamphlet, looking for her breeding cow's job. The thought of bull semen in her delicate vagina sent shudders down her spine. She's spent this long being a virgin, for what? To lose it to some pathetic animal. She almost cried as she read the description of her tasks... forceful penetration weekly, birthing process, the lifespan of the average cow, and the swelling of her teats... it was as if someone gave her a cancer sentence.<br />
<br />
steve opened to his page, and faced an even worse fate. Though he was a bull and was obviously going to be used for breeding, once he reaches a ripe age, he will be evaluated monthly for slaughter and meat use. steve was not a virgin, but his girlfriend left him upon hearing that he'd be fucking other animals... not that he really had a say in the matter, for everything he's heard from people who managed to &quot;Graduate&quot; The program pointed to the animal instincts being too strong to fight. But the fact that he faced death was the hardest part... He figured he had at least a few more years to enjoy life, though... as shitty as life might be.<br />
<br />
Then both of them opened their regeneration letters, and began to read. Their eyes paused at the &quot;Who will my regeneration breeding partiner be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Answer, from the pamphlet: &quot;We try to make the transition process as easy as possible. Animals breed selectively, based on smell and pheremonal sensory expression. A bull may breed with one, two, five, even ten different cows, but a female cow will usually have one male dominate her. More often than not, they chose those with familiar scents. Cows are placed in grazing fields with one bull, who will eventually mate with each of those cows over the course of a month. This is to ensure proper regeneration of America's farmlands&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they looked at their assignments.. They were both assigned to E-15. They knew what that meant... One bull, several cow. They locked eyes, but refused to talk about the matter. Elle's mind tortured her, realizing that not only would she be losing her virginity, but she might be losing it... to her brother!<br />
<br />
They arrived at the regeneration clinic, where they were both put in a line, pamphelets similar to those that they had just red strewn about the place on different information racks. Some children had good fates, as seen by the dog tags they wore... some were going to be hounds, some were going to be stallions. Others, though, made steve only cringe. For instance, one black boy in the corner was set to become a caterpillar on a silk farm. Another small group of 6 people were set to become the queen and primary drones of a honeybee colony... the only problem? The queen was male. Still others were turkey, some were geese, although the boys destined to become breeder chickens, Elle reckoned, had it about as bad as it gets.<br />
<br />
After a while, Elle and steve's names came up. They were both escorted into holding room B, a rather empty room with a large door in back, probably leading into a cattle field. A doctor walked up to them and nodded once, &quot;Alright, welcome to the regeneration farm unit 122B, and we hope your stay is enjoyable. We are held under PETAs standards for fair treatment of animals, and you will be given the basic provisions of life. We believe happy animals are efficient animals, and we hope everything works out for the best&quot; He smiled.<br />
<br />
steve and Elle didn't say a word, only looked to each other and sighed. They hugged for a moment, before two bodyguards broke them up.  steve was restrained in a corner, as Elle was up first. The doctor, still unnamed, instructed Elle to take off her clothes. When she wouldn't comply, two of the bodyguards forcefully took them off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; Elle screamed. &quot;Let me at least have my dignity!&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor laughed, &quot;Dear, you're going to have to let go of that. You're not going to be human anymore, dignity doesn't matter&quot;<br />
<br />
And Elle, naked, was forced to halfway lie on the table, while her feet hung down and touched the floor. The doctor walked up to Elle and inserted a small liquid tubule in her vagina, tight as it was, which dissolved rather quickly. The doctor then walked up to Steve and injected him in several places with a rather large gauge needle. He then began to explain, &quot;The reason we do it this way, in teams, is because your transformation into a breeder cow will trigger the testosterone-linked transformation of him into a bull. Many pheremones are released during the process, and you'll both find that it's much easier to comply than resist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Comply with what...&quot; steve whispered, and then a dark shadow came over his mind as he realized what he'd have to comply with.... Elle actually looked... kind of cute. &lt;No.... No, they're not going to make me...&gt; he thought.<br />
<br />
Elle's transformations began rapidly. Her feet and hands turned to hoofs as her fingers slowly narrowed. She looked at them and screamed, as her face elongated and took on the classic appearance of a cow. She lost her speech capabilities rather quickly, as was expected and engineered that way, because a speaking subject may turn off the transforming bull. Elle's chest began to shrink, as her mammary glands moved to her stomach, extending into a large hump, filled with teats and milk. She looked down in horror, as her spine began to readjust, and her body filled with black and white fur. Her vagina got bigger, much bigger, and a tail popped out above her ass. She resembled some sort of human-cow without the ability to speak now, and she also felt warm down in her pelvis. The warmth spread throughout her body, as her muscles grew, and she tried desperately to escape her bindings. She looked over to steve, who was beginning his own change...<br />
<br />
Steve, seeing his sister like this, was first enraged! The testosterone surged throughout his body, but this only accelerated his changes. The first thing to change was his penis, liked likewise with testosterone. It shot out of his pants, which the bodyguards likewise took off. It was nearly a full foot. His ribcage expanded and a tail popped out quickly. The more anger he had, the faster his changes took place... his nose narrowed, his eyes zoned in, his internal organs shifted, and his hands turned to hooves. And then he saw it.... his sister... The sister that he had taken care of all his life.... and her open, inviting vagina... &lt;No... This is sick.. but I cant stop it... I need it... Oh my god, what am I doing&gt; He thought as he walked towards her, a look of desperation in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Elle looked at Steve, and before she could even stop herself, she moved her tail to the side, exposing her wet vagina. Her changes were still taking place, and her internal organs shifted as well. steve fell to all fours, but then jumped back up with his two front legs, putting them on either side of Elle's arms. He hardened quickly, and as both were almost finished transformation, he pumped in, letting his hard penis explore his sister's vagina. &lt;NO!&gt; both of them yelled inside, but then... &lt;yes... YES!&gt; they thought, pumping away. Elle was horrified at what she was doing, yet couldnt stop herself. &lt;This.. is what... it feels like... oh my god... my brother.. oh my god, this is amazing...sick.. no... yes.... AAaaaaaaaa&gt;....&quot;MOoo!!!!&quot; Elle let out, in orgasm.<br />
<br />
After the transformation was over, both were let out to graze in the fields. Elle looked disgusted with herself, and tried to stay away from Steve. Steve was also disgusted with himself, but tried to stay closer to Elle, to protect her from any of the other cows. How the heck would they adapt to life like this...</p>
