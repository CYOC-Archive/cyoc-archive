<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Bloody hell!&quot; Mono gasped as she sprung from her laptop&#39;s webcam like a laser light show. &quot;I didn&#39;t think any of this &#39;Curse&#39; was IRL!&quot; <br />
<br />
Looking down at herself, Mono&#39;s neon pink cheeks flushed a few tones deeper as her view was obscured by a rather well-endowed pair of bright-light breasts tipped with neon nipples. She twisted this way and that, getting a decent look at her newfound form, her newly full lips curling into a smile at what she saw. Truth be told, as terrifying as it was to be completely changed inside and out, Mono would be lying if she said this wasn&#39;t the hottest thing that had ever happened to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Her,&quot; Mono thought aloud, her smile beaming all the brighter as she rolled the crisp British accent around on her tongue. &quot;I can&#39;t think of myself as &#39;he&#39; anymore. Why is that so... Electrifying?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tentatively, Mono reached up to touch her newfound curves, only for her hands to pass right through her bosom. Furrowing her brow, Mono experimentally poked one breast, watching and feeling her finger phasing through the rest of her the way two flashlight beams would intersect. <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose one can&#39;t expect light to touch light,&quot; she noted. &quot;Particle-wave theory and all that. But maybe I can facilitate something else...&quot; <br />
<br />
Her features splitting into a mischievous grin, Mono about-faced and dove towards her laptop&#39;s webcam, hitchhiking down the information highway to a certain website. Dodging singing rainbow toaster pastry cats, uni-cycling frogs, and more terrifying Italian food that she imagined existed, Mono at last ducked under a large black warning screen and slid across the silvery home page. Throwing open the door set into the side labeled ‘New Updates,’ Mono climbed down the string of options, careful where she placed her high-heeled feet (she could touch things in cyberspace, it seemed). Finding what she was looking for, Mono licked her lips. Wert, Flora the Second, or whatever she was going by these days thankfully looked to be logged in, and Mono was quite looking forward to meeting face-to-photon. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Flora the Second, or Fl0r@ as she was coming to think of herself, leaned back in what was once her computer chair. The charging cable connecting her to the computer gently pulsed with zips and zaps of power, sending her neon mane flashing like a dance club strobe light and her eyes shimmering like a disco ball. The cybernetics stitched across and within Fl0r@&#39;s wetware sparked in time to the pulses of ecstatic pleasure, building a pressure that never quite reached the climax, and likely wouldn&#39;t, Fl0r@ imagined, until she was fully charged. For once, she was glad the process took a bit longer than may have been strictly convenient. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cheerio!&quot; announced a feminine soprano from Fl0r@&#39;s computer speakers before a flash from her webcam nearly blinded her. Once the Fl0r@&#39;s optics stopped glitching from the flash, she blinked a few times to see a glowing pink woman cast from her computer like a slide from a projector. When Fl0r@ waved her arm in front of the beam, the pink woman briefly vanished until Fl0r@ let the light shine unobstructed once more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; chuckled the woman, who could only have been Mono, based on how Fl0r@ recalled describing her. &quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s something British people actually say, but I couldn&#39;t resist the chance to say it in a newly genuine British accent. Pleased to meet you, Flora the Second. Are you still going by that, by the way?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mono extended her hand for a shake, only for it to phase through Fl0r@&#39;s cybernetics. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, sorry about that,&quot; Mono said. &quot;Anyway, I hope you don&#39;t mind the unexpected upload, but I thought I&#39;d pay you a visit to see where the thread takes things next. And, as for my part of the continuation...&quot; <br />
<br />
With a flick of her wrist, Mono plucked a pair of glasses from the ether and mimed placing them on the bridge of her nose, her model briefly stuttering as it updated to include the spectacles. Crossing her legs and hovering in a sitting position, Mono mimed typing away on a keyboard. Glancing over at her computer, Fl0r@ saw Mono’s next post adding itself to the thread, including the fact that she was reading it. <br />
<br />
Nearby, Flora the First finally gave up trying to sleep amidst strobe light manes and digital chatter and rose from her bed. She’d seen Mono appear through her cyberpunk counterpart, but the link between them had strained with their differentiation, though not for long. <br />
<br />
“Mine doppelganger, why doth thou trouble thyself with phantasmal interlopers?” demanded Flora the First. “Particularly when thy more regal self seeks her slumber?” <br />
<br />
Before Fl0r@ had a chance to answer, she felt herself rising to her hind hooves, compelled by some force she imagined must be the continuing Curse of the Storyteller. Flora the First likewise acquired a confused expression before walking forward, clasping hands with her other self, then standing shoulder to shoulder, pressing up against herselves. <br />
<br />
“Having two selves seems like a bit much to keep track of,” Mono said. “I thought maybe we could upload all the data to the same file.” <br />
<br />
>INITIALIZING FLORA/FLORA INTEGRATION.exe flashed across Fl0r@’s optics. <br />
<br />
The line where one Flora began and the other ended blurred. Fl0r@ and Flora the First merged up to the shoulder, cybernetics fusing with silvery flesh, shredded jean jacket melting into elaborate dress. When their necks crashed into one, the line snapped together down their middles, slight breasts combining with hefty synthetic gel polycarbons to swell all the larger, then larger, larger, and larger still. <br />
<br />
>DIGI-DOUBLE-D’S + REGAL RACK = iDUNN’S APPLES <br />
<br />
The electric blue casings acquired a shining golden hue, separating from the soft technorganic flesh beneath to create an armored breastplate. It snapped itself around the Flora’s sides and dug into her shoulders, her new bosom quite heavy, each breast easily larger than the single head they’d soon share. <br />
<br />
>UPGRADING WETWARE/HARDWARE TO GODLY GEAR <br />
<br />
This golden trend shimmered along their cybernetic arms, phasing into their regal counterpart to create an interlocking mesh of celestial clockwork, runic sigils engraving themselves in glowing lights along the sides. <br />
<br />
>ACTIVATING N(H)ORSE-NET TECH.exe <br />
<br />
Rather than continue merging, Flora the First’s slender lower body stretched out and expanded, bulging with flesh and growing skeletal structure reinforced by the finest of dwarven mystical metallurgy. New, purely equine-shaped legs of more cosmic gears and ethereal pistons wove themselves down from the Flora’s growing lower centaur-like form, gracing a technorganic equine body with mechanical motion. <br />
<br />
Their tail flicked longer, braiding itself with more rune-embedded charms as it shifted into a dark coal hue. Their tail also covered Fl0r@’s charging port, shifted all the way back and enlarged a significant degree, requiring a USB (Unearthly Sex Blast) to rejuvinate her internal dual core divine drivers. <br />
<br />
From the coal-black of the tail spread a tawny, warm-chestnut hue along the Flora’s entire technorganic body, sparing only the growing silvery protrusions rising from their lower half’s back. The mechanical appendages stretched and built themselves, further divine clockwork crafting synthetic wings, twin miniature jet engines forming at their cores. <br />
<br />
>FLORA-1 + FLORA-2 = VERSION 3.0  <br />
<br />
At last, the Flora’s heads pressed into one another, natural eyes merging with cyber optics to create technorganic crystals of the brightest leafy green. Their manes interwove before bursting out as a shining cascade of nearly liquid gold. Their singular face joined the warm cocoa coloration of the rest of their body. Their horns snapped into a single elongated sword engraved with runes, and their minds splashing against one another, two oceans crashing into one. <br />
<br />
No longer two disparate Floras, the singularizing Flora found her regal ruler and future rebel personas assimilating themselves, a goddess of old and new, the brilliance of technology and science becoming one with ancient mysticism and the charm of magic. She looked down at herself, at her massive goddess-sized breasts, her techno-centauroid lower portions, and finally, felt magical energy crackle along her hind charging port. A rumble revved in her core, the need to charge returning with a vengeance; apparently a dwarf-tech enhanced goddess needed more power than a partially robotic unicorn. More than that, though, the new entity found herself full of energy, a knowing wisdom from thousands of years of divine history flooding her hard drives, and a regal yet playful persona overpowering all else. <br />
<br />
“How do you feel, Frey@?” Mono asked.</p>
