<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The park was pretty big and was usually packed with kids. It had a lake to go swimming, a play area for kids and a large forest. <br />
<br />
Joe saw Jennie waiting for him by the entrance. She looked really beautiful Joe thought. She was dressed in a tight t shirt and shorts, both of which were struggling to contain her body. She had her hair tied back in a bun, leaving a few strands of black hair lying over her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Joe,&quot; she said cheerily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jennie,&quot; he replied. &quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, feel a bit strange but nothing major.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, I feel the same, almost like I&#39;m shrinking,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;what are you talking about?&quot; Jennie asked smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;look,&quot; Joe said grabbing his shirt. &quot;my clothes are getting baggy and stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They must have stretched or something. So what do you wanna do first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I brought lunch,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
They set up a picnic under a tree, next to the lake, watching people swim. They both ate a sandwich and drank a soda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wanna go swimming?&quot; Jennie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot; what are we gonna wear?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just wear your underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennie headed behind a tree to get changed and came back a few minutes later dressed in a bikini. Joe was dressed in a pair of boxer shorts that might as well have been swim shorts due to how big they were. <br />
<br />
Jennie ran off into the lake and made a large splash, Joe ran after her and jumped in as well.<br />
<br />
They swam for a few hours and had a great time until Jennie dragged Joe out of the lake to get changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to be home by four,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennie started to get changed as did Joe when he noticed her shirt on the floor.<br />
<br />
He walked round the tree to where she was changing to hand it to her to find her standing there stark naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;s, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennie shrieked and covered herself at first but then her shock changed to a smirk and she moved her arms to out them on her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said in a sultry voice, &quot;You&#39;re just a peeping Tom aren&#39;t you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was amazed that she was allowing him to see her. He had seen her naked before, during his spying sessions. But she looked different, almost bigger.<br />
<br />
<br />
She pulled him over to her and pulled his shorts down, she took his throbbing member in her hands and put it in her mouth and went back and forth with her head for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;shame really,  I thought you&#39;d be bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe looked ashamed at that and bowed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m joking, you&#39;re perfect. Five inches is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five! Joe thought. That wasn&#39;t right, he had measured himself before and he had been eight inches, had he shrunk in other places as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back to mine and shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Joe said annoyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jennies house was almost the same as Joe&#39;s, as was her family. Just her, her mom and her sister Mona. Mona was the opposite of Jennie in terms  of personality. Jennie was fun and sporty, Mona was more introverted. But the differences stopped there, other than Mona&#39;s glasses they were identical.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m home mom,&quot; Jennie called. &quot;I brought Joe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay honey, is he staying for dinner.&quot; Jennies mom called<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m fine miss Blake.&quot; Joe called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come one Joe,&quot; Jennie said to him &quot;I need a shower, and you do too.&quot; She said smelling him.<br />
<br />
They were about to shower together when Jennie&#39;s mom stopped them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in my house young man. Oh, Jennie, your new shampoo came.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Blake handed Jennie a yellow bottle of shampoo with a bright red label on it that read Super gro.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, ordered shampoo?,&quot; Joe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jennie replied, &quot; its supposed to make my hair longer&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Joe said pretending to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, in fact I ordered two,&quot; she said going to her room to find the box. &quot;I bought this one, but I don&#39;t need it.&quot; She said grabbing a bottle that read, hair killer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;its supposed to remove body hair, essentially &#39;shrinking the cells&#39; but I don&#39;t have any hair other than on my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;wow,aren&#39;t you lucky.&quot; Joe said as he took the bottle. He needed a new shower gel. He noted that it was the same company that made his moms plant formula.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, well, I&#39;m taking a shower, talk to Mona or my mom or something for a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe did just that he spoke to Miss Blake, she and Joe&#39;s mom had been friends since elementary school, which was why they lived right next to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, your turn.&quot; Jennie said as she poked her head through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Joe room a short shower and tried his new shower gel, rubbing it deep into his skin. He then took a standard bottle of shampoo and rubbed it deep in his blonde hair.<br />
<br />
He dried himself and found the towel had tons of tiny hairs all over it. he checked his leg. Smooth.<br />
<br />
He chuckled, that stuff really works.<br />
<br />
He got changed and went home where his mom was just finishing dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mom,&quot; Joe said. From the living room<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything exciting happen when I was out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t fit many of my clothes anymore, your sister is having to wear the clothes you wear now, and..... You look smaller?&quot; She said looking at him through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t you&#39;re just bigger,&quot; Joe said not wanting to admit she was probably right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe stood up and turned to his...mom?<br />
<br />
Nicole was dressed in a merely a maternity bra and sweatpants, her red hair was cascading down to her back and she didn&#39;t have any glasses on.<br />
But it was her figure that was amazing him. She was thin and toned, her skin looked better too, not as pale.<br />
<br />
 His mom was...<br />
<br />
She was...<br />
<br />
Hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, I&#39;m growing. Now come here.&quot; She said pointing to an old block on the wall where they used to measure Joe as a kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets check your height, the doctor wants a daily report.&quot;<br />
<br />
She positioned Joe at the block. And put her hand above his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey,&quot; she started sternly, &quot;Stand up straight this is serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Nicole said a bit shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That cant be right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? How tall am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your as tall as your sister was yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, wait how tall is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey, baby. You&#39;re only 5&#39;2&quot;. Your sister&#39;s taller than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How tall is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;your sister&#39;s 5&#39;8&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how tall are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, that&#39;s a good question actually.&quot; She said &quot; Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy came down the stairs dressed in Joes old  T shirt. And shorts.<br />
<br />
She looked like she was 17. She was curvaceous and had almost the same figure as Jennie.<br />
<br />
She saw Joe and immediately burst out laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, how are you Joey,&quot; she said giggling. Joe, barely came up to Amy&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy stop teasing your brother and come help me.&quot; Nicole said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Mom.&quot; She said in a deeper voice than Joe remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you measure me?&quot; Nicole said innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;okay,&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole stood against the wall whilst any put her hand above Nicole&#39;s head to measure her. She had to stand on tip toes to do it and had to tell Nicole to move because she couldn&#39;t see the measurement. (Nicole&#39;s head was in the way).<br />
<br />
6&#39;5&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might have to borrow Joe&#39;s clothes as well. And me and you, Amy. Are going shopping tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Joe asked innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie, you can wear Amy&#39;s old clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; he said there was no other option.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know guys,&quot; Nicole said scratching her head. &quot;Lets see what tomorrow brings.&quot;</p>
