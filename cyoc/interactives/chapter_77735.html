<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Nate got into his car and drove away, the words that Victoria said reverberated in his mind and he thought to himself <i>’curses… 
pffbbt… like that shit is even real!’</i> However, as he started to drive, pulling out of the underground garage, something in the back of his mind 
stirred, which stayed small and not a noticeable conscious thought. Nathan, as his parents originally named him, wondered what kind of beast he 
would have become if such things like curses and transformations were even real. In his mind, Nate thought that it would be cool if she made him 
a werewolf since transformations were built in and he could lead a somewhat normal life. If it were true, that he would change when he was 
aroused, that could become problematic considering he was still young and became aroused rather easily. It didn’t help that he lived on an ocean 
front property right off the beach where he had a prime view of a nude beach for gay men only. The only things that would be in his favor was the 
facts that he lived alone and he was safe in his own home. If anything did happen, Nate figured his would be the best place for it.</br>
<br>Immediately as Nate pulled out onto the main road, he saw a very attractive muscle bound guy stopping for a rest from his evening run at 
the intersection. Nate drove slowly, hoping that the green light would turn red to give him a moment to gawk and admire this man’s body. With 
great luck the light turned red right as he approached the intersection. Suddenly, as if they were in a very typical porno, the guy pulled off his 
sweat soaked shirt from the heat of the California air and time seemed to slow down to a fraction of its’ normal speed. Nate’s jaw dropped as his 
facial muscles went slacked from watching the muscle bear’s wet shirt cling to his skin as his muscles bulged and flexed as he struggled to free 
himself from the confining and heat trapping cloth. Slowly, as if on cue, Nate could feel his crotch tighten as he started to pitch his tent. Slowly, as 
he became aroused watching the muscular, tanned and furry chest become exposed for the whole world to see, Nate could begin to feel 
something new and foreign rise up along with it. However, before anything else could happen, time resumed its’ normal speed as the red light 
turned green. While Nate knew he could sit there and gawk, it would be too noticeable and Nate really didn’t want to be looked at like a pervert. 
Having no choice, Nate pressed down on the gas pedal and accelerated through the intersection sighing. Ultimately, Nate knew that there could be 
plenty of eye candy back at home on the beach. As Nate drove along he began to notice sights, sounds and smells like he never had before. To 
him it felt like a bubble of pressure popped inside of his cranium and everything became clear instantly. Thinking it was strange; Nate thought 
about how it could all be possible and ultimately played it off like it was nothing and drew nearer and nearer to his house. As Nate pulled up to 
another intersection and had to stop because of a red light, Nate was finally able to stop and take a moment to process everything while taking in 
everything that was really happening to him at the moment. Nate was amazed at how much everything was improved in a split second; his vision 
so enhanced that he could see down the road about three times further and everything looked clearer than the most high definition image he had 
ever seen on television; his hearing had improved so much that he could hear a conversation between another hot guy and what was presumably 
his girlfriend on the other side of the street from where he was; and the smells… oh the smells… he could smell what could best be described as 
the scent of the couple and what he recognized as the scent of his own arousal, which aroused him even further. Immediately dirty thoughts 
started to enter his mind about what he would let the muscle bear with the girl do to him in total submission. With that thought, Nate shuddered 
as he felt his arousal increase even further and then noticed that the light had turned green again.</br>
<br>Slowly as Nate drove closer and closer to his home, things became more and more uncomfortable. The smell of his own personal arousal was 
bringing about the change Nate didn’t even believe in and it was driving him more and more wild with lust. Slowly Nate felt as though his clothes 
were getting tighter and tighter on him; the fabric pressing against his skin, constricting his movements while his body produced more and more 
heat making his forehead bead with sweat that clung to his brow and threatened to fall off and land in his eyes, impairing his vision and his ability 
to drive. While Nate drove, he remained completely unaware of any of the physical changes that had already happened to him, unable to really pay 
any sort of attention to it all. Finally, off into the distance, he could see the driveway to his house and he was ready to be home, wanting to get 
those damned clothes off of him and be free for a while… if not indefinitely while being in his home. As Nate drove he could feel his pants tighten 
and grow ever more uncomfortable for the same reason as he thought the rest of his clothes grew uncomfortable. Nate thought that his clothes 
were shrinking around him, but instead his lithe muscles had grown to what a very athletic man would have while his cock and balls also grew to 
sizes Nate had only seen in pornos. Nate was very much aware of his own erection, which was painfully evident to him, but not any thing more 
than that. Finally, as Nate was near the end of his evening journey, he pulled up to the driveway of his home, clicked the button to open his 
attached garage and waited a moment for the door to open all the way before he drove into the garage. While he waited, he rolled up the windows 
and the smell of his own arousal began to build and build to the point where he was bathing and basking in it. As Nate drove up and into the 
garage, a wry and wolfish smile formed on his face as he slowly put the car in the garage for the night. Nate’s mind was becoming more and more 
wolfish by the second while he was becoming lost to the lust. Nate’s mind started to become twisted and dark since at his core, Nate was aligned 
toward evil instead of good. With the car off and the garage door closed, Nate grinned as he thought about getting naked and just lounging in his 
car, but decided instead just to sit there and enjoy what was happening to him at the moment. As Nate sat there, slowly becoming more wolfish as 
his arousal drove his change on, Nate felt a weird tugging sensation in his ears and his teeth while he felt even tighter in his own clothes. Curious 
to find out what this tugging sensation was all about, Nate dropped the driver’s sun visor down and lifted the plastic cover off of the visor that 
had a built-in light up mirror and peered at himself closely. As Nate saw his own reflection, his eyes went wide with astonishment and excitement. 
In the mirror he could see that his ears had shifted to pointed ovals and when he moved his lips out of the way, he saw that his top and bottom 
bicuspids were longer, thicker and sharper looking. Instantaneously Nate knew that the curse that Victoria uttered a little while ago was taking 
hold and he was becoming a beast… a werewolf in fact! Nate couldn’t believe what was happening, but he felt a strong desire to be complete, to 
be the werewolf she made him into.</br>
<br>Hurriedly and with purpose, Nate literally jumped out of the car and ran through the house with blazing speed to his room and into his 
personal bathroom, shutting the door behind him to let his own arousal build, driving his change more and more. Now that he could and being 
tired of feeling trapped, feeling confined and restricted by his clothing, Nate walked in front of the full body mirror in his bathroom and took note 
of everything that was different about him. It was at this moment that he realized his clothes hadn’t shrunk… it was his body that grew! Nate 
quickly disrobed with a giant smile on his face that was just beginning to spout a nice, thick and dark shadow, revealing all of the changes to his 
body so far. Nate grinned with a lusty grin at his own reflection, seeing all of his muscles bigger and more defined, looking as though he had the 
body of a football quarterback. Not huge, but definitely not small, being packed with power and force. Nate also loved how his body hair had 
increased to the point where he looked like the muscle bear he first saw when he drove away from Victoria’s. Nate’s arms and legs were covered in 
thick, dense and dark brown hairs that made him look incredibly manly. Curious about his tightened pelvic region, Nate finally pulled off his 
extremely tight boxer briefs. Immediately as they fell to the floor, the scent of his own arousal and musk intensified a hundred fold, filling the 
room with his own smell, bringing his mind back into that familiar territory of being somewhat high and incredibly lusty. Nate grinned lustfully 
seeing his own cock and balls being much bigger than they ever had been. His very erect and throbbing cock stood straight out at what Nate 
thought was seven inches and as thick as can of beer, while his balls were now the size of softballs, sloshing and swimming in semen that was 
just ready to enter the world. Now completely free with his body able to expand and grow as much as it wanted to, Nate stood there and waited 
for the changes happen to his body. As he stood there, with nothing happening, Nate’s darker and sinister wolfish mind started thinking about 
ways that he could speed up the process and then it hit him. Nate moved quickly into the large, four person shower that was encased in water and 
airtight glass. Many, many times Nate took a hot and steamy shower where the steam became so thick it was like smoke and Nate could barely see 
through it… if at all. Nate knew being in there, with a smaller space to fill with no ways for his own scent to escape, it wouldn’t take long before 
he was completely a werewolf. What Nate didn’t know was that when everything was said and done, he would be dark, sinister and demonic to his 
core with only thoughts of: lust, building his pack and total domination over the weak and pathetic humans who would be either his to shape into 
more pack members or be a subservient sub-species to the more perfect werewolves of the world.</br>
<br>Nate grinned as his newer wolfish self took over while he opened the door to the shower stall, stepped in and closed the door behind him 
sealing his fate to what Victoria made for him. However, what neither him or Victoria knew was what she unleashed with her curse. As Nate stood 
there in the shower stall, he kept his eyes glued to the same full body mirror that was parallel to the shower stall and watched, waiting for further 
changes to take place. Nate felt charged and invigorated by it all and couldn’t wait to see what the final results were. As the scent began filling the 
small glass enclosure, Nate’s eyes widened as he began to feel the changes take hold of him and watched his body begin to shift. Slowly Nate’s 
muscles grew outward, gaining size and becoming huge slabs of beef. Nate’s heart began to race as his muscles got to a size that the most avid 
power-lifters could be jealous of. Slowly, but surely, Nate’s body hair increased even more, making him look like how Bo Dixon looked and he felt 
incredibly sexy. Still watching, keeping his eyes on himself, Nate grinned as his cock bobbed with every seriously powerful beat of his heart, 
feeling as though it would pound its’ way right out of his chest. He could feel the still cool air envelop his hot and pre slicked cock while the 
temperature continued to increase from his own body heat. As Nate stood there, his human mind hazing over and being completely replaced by 
that of his new werewolf mind, Nate grinned from pointed ear to pointed ear as he began to feel that familiar tugging sensation in his ears and 
mouth.</br>
<br>Nate knew that the full transformation was about to take place and he couldn’t wait to see what he would become. Nate began yearning for 
his body to change, for him to shed his humanity and become the creature he had secretly wanted to be for quite some time. Slowly, a warm 
tingling sensation built up all over his body and Nate knew he was close to getting his wish. Slowly, Nate felt his ears stretch more to points, still 
appearing slightly human but more wolfish. At the same time, Nate felt an odd sliding sensation in his mouth while a cool, iron-tasting fluid filled 
his mouth and he swallowed the fluid, savoring the taste as if it was the most delectable beverage. As the thick fluid washed down, Nate ran his 
tongue over his teeth and felt that they had lengthened and thickened even more to resemble wolfish fangs. Nate grinned and pulled back his lips, 
exposing his pearly whites and saw exactly what he thought. His teeth were much longer, more deadly and definitely much more menacing than 
anything he had or seen in the past. Happy with what was happening to him and what had happened thus far, Nate tilted his head back and 
howled a human howl which quickly turned into the sound of a true wolf’s howl and reverberated in the glass enclosure making the glass panes 
shake slightly from the strong vibrations. Nate grinned and started to behave differently as he felt himself become lost to what he was becoming. 
Nate was eager for the full change and before he knew it, Nate would have exactly that. As Nate’s new self continued to emerge slowly, he could 
feel even more things change inside of him, as if his body was preparing for what was bound to come next. Nate could feel his tendons and 
ligaments lengthen, thicken and allow for the new configuration of his body. Even though the process was slow and felt like his entire body was on 
fire, Nate loved every minute of it and couldn’t wait to see the final product. Then, as if on cue, Nate took in a huge whiff of his scent as his heart 
beat even harder, feeling adrenaline and endorphins being pumped into his body, as if the brain was preparing the vessel for the change while it 
riled him up something fierce. Suddenly Nate could feel his hands and feet ache as he grunted, sounding more animalistic all the while. Nate 
grinned as he watched his hands and feet grow, lengthening and thickening all the while as they developed into paws. As the skin and muscles 
grew thicker and puffier, the pads of his feet and hands thickened, becoming rough while soft and darkened to being nearly black. Then, without 
warning, a wave of blissful pain shot through his body, forcing Nate to arch his back, feeling the bones cracking and popping while thickening to 
support his wolfish side. Nate moaned and howled as his torso thickened while his legs snapped, breaking in three places as he took a digitigrade 
stance, stumbling slightly while placing his hand paws on the glass for support. Nate moaned, grunted and growled even more while he lost 
himself to the nature of the wolf as he stared at his hands as his fingernails began to lengthen rapidly, getting harder, becoming pitch black like 
obsidian as they grew and curled into deadly claws. Seeing this new development, Nate grinned widely and watched his teeth changing right 
before his eyes as well. His teeth grew longer, sharper, pointier and definitely much more deadly. His bicuspids were long, thick and sharp wolf 
fangs as his other teeth were more fitting of a wolf to tear into the toughest of flesh easily and make short work. Nate moaned and growled, 
losing himself further to the wolf as his medium brown body hair grew out rapidly all over Nate’s body and thickening to the point where it was 
fur. Intently, Nate forced his eyes open, wanting to watch everything that happened to him and noticed that his eyes were different… more feral, 
more animalistic and a beautiful honey yellow and chocolate brown mix. Then, suddenly, an overwhelming amount of blissful pain filled Nate’s 
cranium as the bones started to crack, shift and change as his face began pushing out into a wolf muzzle with his teeth immediately realigning 
while his ears pulled toward the top of his head as they stretched and formed into perfect triangular wolf ears while his nose was forced to be 
flatter and at the end of his new muzzle, growing dark black and moist. At the same time, Nate could feel his tongue change, flattening and 
widening as it changed. New and more powerful scents filled the air, driving Nate wild with lust, grasping his nicely sized human cock in his paw 
and began to stroke. As Nate slowly stroked his cock, wanting to build up an incredible load to match how he was truly feeling, Nate watched as 
his cock began growing in both length and girth while his balls swelled in size at the very same time. Nate grinned now fully wolf-like as his cock 
grew in his paw to a length of seven and a half inches and five inches in width while his balls swelled to the size of large grapefruits brimming 
with potent werewolf seed. As Nate stood there, lost in lust, stroking his cock, he felt a large amount of pressure at the base of his spine that 
began to push forward. Slowly, the pressure grew and extended as an eight inch tail made itself present, growing rapidly as fur flowed upward as 
if it was running water. Being driven mad with lust and his wolfish mind completely dominating his human side, Nate began stroking his cock even 
more, but slow and with methodic purpose. As his lust and horniness hit an all-time high, Nate started to thrust into his paw, grunting and 
growling, wanting his load out. Quickly, his pace built up to the point where he was fucking his paw feverishly and furiously. Then, without 
warning, he passed the point of no return, throwing his head back and howled as his thick and ropey white cum splashed and splattered on the 
glass as it went everywhere from Nate continuing to buck while his sexual high slowly came down.</br>
<br>As Nate slowly came down, panting hard and furiously, he realized everything that happened and grinned deviously. He loved the beast he 
had become and he could feel even closer to his chaotic evil alignment. Leaving the cum on the glass, as if to mark his territory and to be a nearly 
instantaneous trigger to force him to change, Nate walked out of the shower enclosure and flexed for himself in the mirror. Nate was incredibly 
happy with the way things turned out and he couldn’t wait for the next phase. He was uncertain if he would increase his pack, become demonic in 
appearance to match how Nate truly felt, or increase his pack and become his true self at the same time. However, as he stood there thinking 
about making more werewolves, demonic werewolves at that, Nate began to grin wickedly as thoughts came across his mind of the best people he 
could turn to really develop his pack. There was Butch, the football team’s defensive coordinator, who used to be a defensive lineman back in his 
day before he got injured and forced him out of going pro. Then there was Rick, the school principal who was average in build, but had a ton of 
connections to turn several of the students or their fathers into werewolves. Then there was his best friend and werewolf enthusiast Dustin who 
had an awesome body from being one of the team’s current defensive lineman and might be the best person to share this with and devise a 
strategy for increasing the pack. All three were great options and there were plenty of directions that things could go.</br></p>
