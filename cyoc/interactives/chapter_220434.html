<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the university Erick noticed that things were very strange, a lot of people spastically the men walked hunched over, they were poorly dressed as if they didn&#39;t know how to do it. And from time to time they act like they are lost in thought.<br />
<br />
His day was weird at best. In classes, the male teachers could barely explain the basics of the subject, while the students paid no attention to them, in fact everyone accepted he and the female population were here more out of habit than out of interest. <br />
<br />
At lunch time it became more crowded than normal, many boys were fighting over food to the point that if you were distracted they would steal it.<br />
<br />
Erick couldn&#39;t stand the chaos so he decided to leave the place. As he went out through the corridors, he could not help but see several strange things, several male students and staff were hunched over and many were not wearing shirts, in fact, when he was able to recognize one of the smartest students on campus Roger, he was thin and hairless and someone he was always well dressed. So it was a shock to see him shirtless, his messy appearance and looking at his cell phone stupidly.<br />
<br />
Tempted by curiosity, he went over to see if he was alright. But as he got closer he saw Allan crossing the hall but he wasn&#39;t the same guy he saw in the morning. Like most he was shirtless but it wasn&#39;t the only difference. He was a little bigger than before, and much hairier as well. His jaw was more pronounced and his brows came together in the middle. He was barefoot, and his toe seemed longer, his leg was ultra hairy, like the rest of his body, his posture seemed very primitive. The stubble of him on his face was bigger than in the morning. I notice that he had his cell phone in hand. He started to smell something in the air, he saw a girl run away and then he went to chase her.<br />
Shaking off his surprise, he remembered that Roger was close to him, when he laid eyes on him his jaw almost dropped to the ground. Because in front of him Roger now looks like Allan. He saw how he turned his head as if he were looking for something, but whatever he was looking for he did not find it, without warning he threw himself to the ground and began to do push-ups, in a matter of seconds he could catch the smell of sweat and testosterone filled the air. Erick couldn&#39;t be attracted by the smell.<br />
<br />
He suddenly heard a “Pisssh”. When he caught the source, he noticed that it came from a girl who was hiding in the drinking fountains. When he went to her he was taken by a surprise hug. &quot;Thank god a normal boy, I need your help.&quot; She said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on and why do you need my help?&quot; answered Eric<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why that happens. This morning when we got to the university my boyfriend read that he had an email from the faculty when I asked him what it was he told me it was a bunch of words without any order, but suddenly he started acting strange like more fool. When we break up I notice all the guys acting weird. When it was lunch time and I met him I noticed that he had changed like that guy over there.&quot; He said pointing to Roger.<br />
“And he was not the only one, all the men were like them. All obsessed with eating, exercising and sex. And it seems that the more they see the message or do the above, their changes accelerate#. Suddenly I hear a loud “HOOOHAAA” coming from the hallway. &quot;And that&#39;s the other thing my boyfriend wants sex and I don&#39;t want it, I need help.&quot; They heard the same howl again but closer. &quot;HOOOHAAA&quot;. “Or he didn&#39;t find me I have to run. And she ran off, then out of sight as she turned the corner of the hallway. Suddenly, a boy passed by her, just as changed as Allan and Roger, but it seems that with a greater change. His arms were longer and protruded from his frame, he noticed that a layer of hair covered his arms and chest and part of his hunched back. His spine had also grown and curved to support his muscular torso. His huge pecs were covered in veins and his stomach was an extremely muscular paunch. His legs also increased slightly, but his pelvis had widened and his legs had spread out to the sides.<br />
<br />
As he walked past him he recognized him as Bill and boy was he athletic though he wasn&#39;t half as eclectic as the beast that just passed.<br />
He suddenly saw how Roger stopped from his planks, he was all sweaty, he smelled something in the air and saw a backpack thrown away, he went to check it only to later let out a cry of joy for finding a stopper with bananas. While he ate he was looking at his cell phone that for some reason was still unlocked. Suddenly Erick&#39;s eyes widened from seeing Eric&#39;s body change more and end up like Bill. During the entire change Roger only let out moans of pleasure.<br />
<br />
In shock he backed away and then ran into a door, upon entering he discovered that he was in one of the teacher break rooms and it was empty of people. Then he heard a commotion coming from the window, when he got closer he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. The entire campus was filled with changed men like Roger and Bill. Some were eating, some were exercising with what they could, some were chasing the girls, and some were even fucking each other outdoors.<br />
<br />
Erick suddenly knew what was happening. &quot;The Chronoviac that must be, but how?&quot; He suddenly remembered what the girl said. “my boyfriend read that he had an email from the faculty.&quot;<br />
And that was when he found out. Erick, in order to have extra money, works part-time as an assistant in the school resources department, so he has the contacts of all the men in the faculty, whether they are teachers or students. The list of women is held by another assistant. &quot;That&#39;s the chronoviac I use my email contact list and somehow I send an email that starts the caveman program to everyone who sees it.&quot;<br />
Once he detected the problem he couldn&#39;t help but let out a sigh, he just had to go home and fix everything. He decided to try to leave the place, peeking through the door to check if everything was clear, he couldn&#39;t help but swallow because Roger was still there, but now he was masturbating. Roger had a face of pure delight as some drool dripped off him. He had a pair of testicles the size of tennis balls next to a cock that was more than twice as big and long as average that constantly spurted spurts and spurts of yellowish cum that smelled very powerful and intoxicating. Erick felt his cock get very hard and painful.<br />
He decided to return to the room. He leaned against the door as he thought “I could go home and put an end to this” but then he thought as he stared at his crotch “Or I could…”.<br />
Inspecting the room further he discovered that there was a refrigerator when he opened it he saw that it was full of food possibly the lunch of various teachers took it out and put it on the floor. Then he saw a projector, when he inspected it he noticed that it was a model with a bluetooth system. He didn&#39;t think about it anymore, he activated the projector and then linked it with his cell phone. On the living room wall there was an image of his cell phone screen, then he opened his email and there, as I imagine, is the email that the cronoviac sent. When he was going to open it his finger stopped for a second, he thought if it was worth it but his doubts died when he heard the loud moans of pleasure coming from the hallway.<br />
The email was rows and rows of words without any order. Erick stared at her for several seconds and thought it wouldn&#39;t work but then he got tired of reading all those lines and suddenly he feels strange “uh huh”. He started to feel hungry and horny as he grew a stubble and slouched a bit. Unconsciously he began to take off his shirt, pants and shoes because it was starting to bother him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost naked, it is observed that his body became bigger than before, and much hairier as well. Her jaw was more pronounced and her eyebrows met in the middle. His nose flared, then she caught the scent of something on the ground, immediately grabbed it and ate. His toe seemed longer, her leg was ultra hairy, like the rest of her body. His posture became more primitive. His stubble turned into a regular shaggy beard.<br />
Erick looked up at the ceiling and noticed a pipe, without warning he jumped up and started doing pull-ups like crazy. It was a stronger urge now, second only to eating and having sex. While exercising he looked at his mail again and his changes progressed further. A layer of hair covered his arms and chest and part of his back. His muscles swelled and grew with each pullup. His spine had also grown and curved to support his muscular torso. His huge pecs, arms and shoulders were covered in vein and his stomach was an extremely muscular paunch. His legs also increased slightly, but his pelvis had widened and his legs had spread out to the sides. His cock twitched in his boxers and he decided to let go.<br />
. His unevolved and extremely muscular body quivered with each breath. His arms were longer and stuck out of his frame. Sweat and testosterone filled the air. His cock jerked back into his boxers, one large hand ripping them off revealing a huge erect cock that was easily more than twice the girth and length of what it had been before. His testicles throbbed and bulged like tennis balls.<br />
Without needing to touch her, he began to cum, shooting streams of seed. At first it was white in color but later it turned yellowish. His scent was strong and musky, a stream fell into her mouth and she couldn&#39;t help but let out a howl of pleasure &quot;HOOOOAAAHH&quot; With one last powerful shock her jaw spread further, her forehead arched her muscles bulged more and her last thoughts of humanity vanished</p>
