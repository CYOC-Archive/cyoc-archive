<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer thought a lot that night. On one hand, she had the chance to get her human life back. A chance which likely would not ever come again. But on the other, she realized that she had gotten fairly use to her current life, and that going back to her old life almost certainly wouldn&#39;t be possible. She has missed too much. Also many of who were once her friend had either been punnished by Ty, or moved on with their lives. <br />
<br />
She has spent years being treated as a dog. And to her surprise, she had actually started to enjoy her current life as the years went by. She was able to see so many new and exciting places. Plus, it was not as if Ty treated her badly. On the contrary, he treated her far better than how most other owners treated their pets. Lately, Ty always would giver her attention, even letting her sleep in her own bed that he had bought just for her. It was not even a dog bed, but a normal one. She even had her own room. A few months ago, Ty started to change her food from plane dry dog food, to whatever he made that day. <br />
<br />
If she didn&#39;t look the way she did, and was basically fully human, she would be actually very well off. Ty never asked for rent, or to help with chores. Not that she could ever pay or do them as a dog anyways, but he never even showed any signs of annoyance at her for being an added expense. Though Jennifer reasoned that was because he ultimately made her his dog, so he naturally is responsible anyways. <br />
<br />
By now, it was the middle of night. Jennifer, unable to sleep, decided she needed to have a short walk to help her think. After jumping down off her bed, she began walking to her door. All the doors in the house had a custom doggy door in them which automatically opened when she got near thanks to a special chip in her collar. Last year Ty changed the house into a private estate with a fairly large mansion and a massive, fenced in yard. He said it was to keep the annoying neighbors from always bothering him. <br />
<br />
As she began her walk, not even a minute in, she was suddenly interrupted by hearing her name called. She turned and saw Didi walking up to her. Didi was special, as she was the only other peraon who knew about Jennifer&#39;s circumstances, that she was not really a dog. But unfortunately, Didi was not as lucky. Ty had completely erased what was once Dustin, her former identity, from existance. As far as she knew, she has always been Didi, and reguardless of what people said, she could not be convinced that it was not the truth. Not that anyone would anyways with Ty altering reality, but he had added that part just in case he overlooked sonething. <br />
<br />
It was only after the first year living together, that Ty allowed Didi to understand what Jennifer was saying. The two of them had actually gotten quite close too. Jennifer knew she would miss her if she were to leave. Didi was her only friend at the moment. The only one who she could talk to besides Ty. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; asked Didi. &quot;Can&#39;t sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thinking, and felt like a walk could help&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it about Ty&#39;s question?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Jennifer said, feeling a bit anxious that she had yet to come to a decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not ask him simply for what you want? You may not have realise this, but he would honestly listen to your request if you asked, as long as it isn&#39;t too unreasonable. He actually recently started to feel really regretful over how long he has kept you as our dog. And while he doesn&#39;t regret making you our dog, he understands that he took it a bit too far with you. So just ask him to change you however you want. Why not use this chance to make your life how you want it? Im sure it will work out. But whatever you choose, I hope we can still be friends after everything gets settled.&quot; Didi said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was shocked. Could she really ask Ty to change her into anything? Or even something else all together? &quot;I will give it some thought. Oh, and of course we will still be friends, I hope at least we will be able to be anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Didi bent down and hugged Jennifer. After a few seconds she got up and headed back inside. Jennifer decided to head back to bed after a few more minutes. And after another hour or so of thought, had come up with her request, and had fallen asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning, as Jennifer was walking out of her room, she noticed Ty and Didi were in the kitchen. Didi was cooking while naked and having sex with Ty. When Ty noticed Jennifer was up, he quickly finished his morning session with Didi and asked her about her decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what did you decide? Stay as our dog, where I finish your transformation. Or would you rather go back to being human, leaving here and never speaking about what happened here?&quot; Asked Ty.<br />
<br />
Gathering up her courage, Jennifer answered &quot;Actually, would it be alright if I suggested something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit taken aback, Ty hesitated for a moment, and after half a minute, he spoke. &quot;That&#39;s unexpected. I honestly thought you would have jumped at the chance for your human life back. But sure, what do you suggest? Keep in mind that I have no plans on sharing my ability or undoing everything I have done.&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit excited that he actually was open to suggestions, Jennifer quickly asked &quot;would it be ok if ...&quot;</p>
