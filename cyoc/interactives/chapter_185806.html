<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Brody, Ethan, let&#39;s go! We got here right on time!&quot; Clara Lambert got out of the car, the very picture of stepford suburbian motherhood. Her smile seemed half honest on the best of days, her trim and appealing body just a bit too alike all the other mothers in the neighborhood. Her blond hair was arranged in the very same flowing cut that many of the others had, and she dressed in a blouse and jeans. It was not often that she got to take her children out to the zoo, but when she heard about what precisely this zoo ah, specialized in, she knew she had to go through with this.<br />
<br />
Her husband Max had divorced her about a year ago - due to professional differences, and the way he wanted to live not exactly meshing with how she did. But in the process she ended up with the kids, and what kids they were. Brody Lambert, the high school quarterback, was something of an egotist, his short cut blond hair, light icy blue eyes and attractive, masculine features gave him a leg up with the local girls which he happily used with impunity. Varsity made him a minor local celebrity, and he enjoyed that in every way. Today, he came to the zoo in a green tank top and shorts, eagerly showing his physique.<br />
<br />
The younger brother, Ethan, was somewhat surprisingly a nerd who also enjoyed gymnastics. While he didn&#39;t show it off as regularly as his brother, owing to his clothes trending more toward long sleeves and billowing looks, and his face having a more boyish, slightly chubby look to it, under it all Ethan was muscled to a great degree - almost more toned than his elder brother. Almost. His dirty blond hair was styled in a curly look, his darker blue eyes hidden a bit behind blocky glasses. His shirt today had a logo on it, and his pants were large and covered up his legs, not giving any hint of the strength lurking inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...There better be some hot zookeeper chicks...&quot; Brody murmured to himself. He was taking a day off of his usual prowling for this. Not to mention possibly missing out on the gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom do we really gotta---&quot; Ethan himself had already done his workout that day, and had been looking forward to some gaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! It&#39;s lovely out, you two! We&#39;re not just gonna sit at home and do nothing.&quot; Clara had not intended to have two children, she would&#39;ve been happy with just Brody. And honestly with how they were, they exhausted her. She had been hoping that Max could take them and let her just...unwind. But no. He was deemed too irresponsible for children - so here she was, living the lifestyle of a single mom. In the middle of the ass end of suburbia - where nothing ever happened.<br />
<br />
So when she heard of this zoo, and got the sales pitch for what allegedly happened there according to some rather...seedy websites, she decided to check it out in a fit of pique. She wondered honestly if anything was going to happen.<br />
<br />
As they checked their tickets in, Clara leading the way, she saw what looked like a massive array of biomes set up in various areas for various different animal groupings to live in. There was also what she had had her eye on when she looked at that website - the &quot;animal care worker&quot; positions that people could &quot;join and learn from&quot;. Supposedly, according to that website, the people who signed up to these things would become one of these animals - usually an endangered or threatened species to help with breeding issues. Of course however the changed people could not stay that way forever.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d be changed back after a year - and then be offered another year if they wanted. She didn&#39;t know how these two would react to this new job they&#39;d be undertaking. Supposedly it&#39;d also take some time - over the course of about 10 visits to the zoo, the people in the job would slowly transform into their new form.<br />
<br />
And Clara was just selfish enough and just drunk enough that night to go through with a plan for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look you two! I think this place offers community service hours!&quot; Clara pointed out the animal care service. <br />
<br />
And Brody visibly rolled his eyes at the sight. Tell the truth he had not been looking forward to that part of graduation. Football season was over, and he was hoping to just coast by. He hated the idea, and wondered what kind of loon came up with the requirement. &quot;Can&#39;t I just choose my own---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah mom, come on! This looks so lame!&quot; Ethan crossed his arms, clearly not fond of the idea either.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re closing in on the deadline, Brody,&quot; Clara responded, &quot;And I know you well enough, Ethan, to know you&#39;d leave it to the absolute last minute. Come on! It&#39;ll be fun!&quot; For me at least, Clara thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Brody hoped, desperately now, that at least the program SHOULD have some cute zookeeper chicks to keep him entertained, and he followed his mother in, Ethan shortly behind. And for once, Brody was not let down. Three amazingly athletic, busty women about a few years older than Brody were standing around discussing, though when their eyes went on the suburban family, Brody swore he felt his dick give an interested pulse. One was an African American beauty with dyed red hair that caught Brody&#39;s eye, another was a tall, busty blond, and another was a light skinned brunette that also had Ethan swooning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, are you three here for the show? We&#39;re going to be starting in forty five minutes, so...you&#39;re welcome to wait if you&#39;d like---&quot; The African American woman started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, these are my sons. They need their high school community service hours. I recall hearing there were always openings in the animal care---?&quot; Clara started, suppressing a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes! Right.&quot; The blond nodded, and said, &quot;I&#39;m Lucy, this is Mira, and Danielle,&quot; she gestured respectively to the black woman and the brunette. Ethan for his part repeated Danielle&#39;s name under his breath, very obviously interested in her already.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this should cover their community service needs quickly. We&#39;ll sign some forms and hand em over,&quot; Lucy said, looking over the two, &quot;Just let me know what kind of animals you&#39;d like to work with, boys. We mostly work with endangered or threatened species, though there are some rather more farm style animals available...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brody rolled his eyes, but Ethan tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, &quot;Dude, get over it. Hot chicks.&quot; He didn&#39;t know if the three zookeepers could hear him, and honestly, Ethan didn&#39;t care. He also decided to go with whatever Brody chose - that way they could deal with whatever happened together.<br />
<br />
A piece of paper with a list was handed off to the two of them. Brody supposed he should pick whatever was least lame. Breathing, he went ahead and chose...</p>
