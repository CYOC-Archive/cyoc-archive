<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Prince Arthur is a 12-year-old boy with blond short-cut blond hair and blue eyes, he also has an athletic body. He is the youngest son of King Charles IV, the King of Great Britain, he has a 16-year-old brother Prince Theodore and a 20-year-old sister Princess Ann. Arthur is a mischievous brat, who demands anything, and if he does not get what he wants, he retaliates, not caring who he harms mentally and/or physically.<br />
<br />
One day, it is a nice warm spring afternoon on a Monday, Arthur is walking home from school. Normally he gets picked up by a Chauffeur sent by his dad, for security reasons, but being such a stuck up brat, Arthur simply chooses to ignore the dangerous he puts himself in by deciding to walk home. “I am old enough to look after myself,” the young Prince tends to say, when confronted by his parents why he, again, walked home by himself. This day is no exception, as Arthur calmly walks along the street in Down Town of London City. When he passes a store, which lies on his route home, he notices something that catches his eyes. He stops and turns towards the window of the Store, the Store sells electronics such as TVs, Microwaves, Mobile Phones and the likes. What caught Arthur&#39;s attention was a sign that read, “do you wish to be able to get what you want, without needing to worry about legal consequences? Are you someone who has to have the power over anyone and anything, but no one does as you want? Then why not try “The Chronivac”, the device that can grant your every wish!” Below the sign Arthur sees what seems to be a Mobile Phone which looks just like a Samsung Galaxy A52. After reading the sign and seeing the Device, it only takes Arthur a second to decide, the boy heads into the Store and a few Minutes later exits the building with a paper bag, a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
When arriving home, Arthur heads straight for his room, once inside, he locks his door and jumps on his huge bed. He takes out the package with the Device and tears it open, taking the Device out of its packaging, and turns it on. Once the Device is booted up, the young Prince is greeted by a message:<br />
<br />
“Welcome and thank you for purchasing our Device! We are a group of scientists, who try to make the World a better place, by creating new devices which would make the lives of so many people much more easier,” the message starts, “what you are holding is the newest version of our creation known as “The Chronivac”. The Chronivac started of as a bulky and heavy box, which looked similar to an old PC, with only a very few options available. Over the years, and thanks to all the people who have bought and tested the Device and to the Data we collected, we were able to created a much better device. A device which is not only easier to handle, but which also contains so many new options and ways to make lives much more enjoyable.”<br />
<br />
Arthur reads the message with growing interest... and inpatients, “oh come on,” he whines, “tells me already what this thing is supposedly able to do!”<br />
<br />
The message continues, “now you might be wanting to know, what this Device is able to do.”<br />
<br />
Arthur rolls his eyes, as if saying, “oh, you think?”<br />
<br />
The boy continues to read, “this Device has lots of possibilities. It is able to not only change a Target&#39;s Age or Gender, but also change the Target&#39;s Race and appearance, it even can change and alter the Reality.” The message then lists a few examples, which fill the young Prince with excitement, a smirk appearing on the boy&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
After the list of examples, there is a warning message, which Arthur ignores completely, and simply scrolls all the way down to the end and selects “continue”. The Screen then changes and shows a empty black background in the middle with “Scanned Files” as a headline. On the left side of the Screen is a bar with the Headline “Options”, below which there are tabs labeled “Age”, “Gender”, “Animal”, “Inanimate”, “Race”, and many more.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Arthur says with a nod, “looks simple enough. Now, as I have understood, to be able to change someone or something, I would need to scan it, him or her.” Arthur thinks for a while, he then decides to scan himself, “if this thing really can change my appearance, I&#39;ll do something small first before moving to something extreme.” The young Prince then selects “Scan” and the camera turns on, he turns the camera to face him and a message tells him to move to a suitable distance. Arthur gets up from his bed and walks over to his desk, he takes a stack of books and places them on the desk, he then leans the “Phone” against the books and presses the “Scan” button.<br />
<br />
“Please move to a suitable distance for the Scan to start,” the message reads, “when the Word “scanning” stops blinking red and changes to green, while continuing to blink, please stand still while the device scans.”<br />
<br />
Arthur does as told, once at a suitable distance, in which his whole body is seen on the screen, the blinking red word “scanning” changes green and Arthur stands completely still, his arms by his sides and his legs slightly apart. It only takes less than a minute for the scanning to complete, after which the Device gives off a “ping” sound and automatically returns to the start screen. The boy walks over and takes the device, he then walks over to his bed and sits on the edge. When looking at the screen, Arthur notices a file had appeared which has his name below it. Arthur opens his file and his eyes widen when he sees the stats:<br />
<br />

Age: 12<br />
Gender: male<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Hair style and color: blond, short cut<br />
Eye color: blue<br />
Body: athletic<br />
Penis: 2&#39;&#39; flaccid; 4&#39;&#39; erect<br />
Parents: King Charles IV; Queen Consort<br />
Siblings: Prince Theodore Windsor 16; Princess Ann Windsor 20<br />
Wearing: British School Uniform<br />

Crush: Jessica Blanchet 11-year-old<br />
Desires: wants to have power over all<br />
IQ: 125<br />
Libido: low<br />
Awareness: on<br />
<br />
Arthur blushes when he notices the device knowing how “big” he is down below, “man, this thing knows everything,” he says. After his embarrassment subsides, Arthur thinks of what to change about himself, “hm... I always was curious of what it would feel like to have a tail,” he says to himself, “I wonder if there is an option in the “Animal” tab which only would let me grow a tail, I don&#39;t want to end up stuck as a mouse or dog if something should go wrong.”<br />
<br />
The Prince opens the tab, he sees folders labeled “feral”, “anthro”, “ears”, “muzzles”, “paws” and lastly “tails”. Smiling to himself, Arthur opens the folder and his eyes widen, “whoa, so many tails to choose from,” he says in amazement. As he scrolls through the various kinds of tails, his eyes land on a folder labeled “Dragon”. Imagining himself having a strong and prehensile tail fills the young boy with excitement, so he opens the folder. He is happy with the options laid out, he can not only choose if he wants fur or scales, but also what color he would like and also choose to have either spikes, fur or nothing on the tail. After a while of thinking, Arthur decides he wants his tail to have royal-blue scales on top and white scales beneath, he also chooses to have band of blond fur running down the center of the tail to the tip. After selecting the tail&#39;s “design”, the boy is next presented with the option of how long he wished to have his tail, “permanent”, “Minutes”, “Days”, “Weeks”, “Years” or “Hours”. Arthur decides to first have the tail for an Hour, “if I enjoy it, I&#39;ll make it permanent,” he says to himself. He is then asked if he&#39;d want the change to be painful or pleasurable, “hm... I am not fond of pain,” he mumbles, “so I&#39;ll go with pleasurable.” After selecting this, Arthur is asked if he&#39;d wish to alter the reality, so that everyone, except him, would assume he&#39;d always had a tail, “nah... I won&#39;t be needing that if my Tail is gone in an Hour anyway,” he says, “I&#39;ll select that option when I decide to have a tail permanently.” Arthur checks one last time over his selections, then with a satisfied nod, he confirms them.<br />
<br />
After confirming the change, Arthur feels a tingling run through his body, like pins and needles, then he feels a strange sensation right above his bum. It feels as if a hand is pulling at his tailbone, the boy lets out a discomfort groan as he feels his pants press against something growing from his back. Arthur quickly gets to his feet and pulls his pants, including his black boxer briefs, off, letting out a sigh of relief. Once the pants and briefs are discarded, the boy is overcome by a pleasurable sensation, which causes the boy to start moaning softly, his penis starting to erect. Arthur continues to feel the Tail growing from him, becoming longer, stronger and thicker and the pleasurable feeling only intensifies, causing Arthur to fall onto his hands and knees.<br />
<br />
The young boy is panting and moaning, a smile on his face as he feels his growing Tail swish behind him. At first it is a numbing sensation, the same when his arm or leg “fall asleep”, but soon he starts to feel the tail more as new nerves start to connect with his system and brain, giving him the knowledge how to use a tail. Arthur giggles when he feels a tickling sensation on his new limb, assuming the scales and fur are appearing, the sensation of growing subsides and soon the other sensations also subside.<br />
<br />
Arthur does not turn around for a while, he waits until the afterglow of the pleasurable feeling subsides. He then slowly turns his head, while staying on all fours, and his smile turns into a huge grin. Behind him, he sees a long and thick Dragon&#39;s Tail, covered in blue and white scales and a band of blond fur, which runs from the base to the tip of his new Tail. The Tail is at least a meter in length and at least 50 centimeters in diameter, slimming when getting closer to the tip.<br />
<br />
The Prince gets to his feet, he wobbles a few times, not used to having such an huge body part, before steadying. Arthur tries to take a few steps, his Tail swishes behind him, keeping him steady, and walks over to his full length mirror. He grins when he sees his tail, “hehe, it looks so cool,” he says, “it actually suits me.” After checking out his Tail, Arthur heads to his bed and sits down, leaning back against the headboard. The boy brings his new Tail around and lies it on his lap, he then runs a hand along the Tail and is surprised to feel how sensitive it seems to be, which causes the boy to moan and bite his lower lip, his penis twitching as it starts to become erect. Knowing he would only have the Tail for an Hour, Arthur tries to decide what to do. He looks at his watch, “I still have at least three to four hours until dinner,” he says to himself, he then looks at the device, laying next to him, “should I change more? Should I try and change something else? Should I wait until after dinner, before doing anything else,” he mutters to himself, “decisions, decisions... .”</p>
