<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shortly after sunrise the following morning, you addressed your now-reverted followers. They looked at you with adoration, for you were true divinity in their midst, and at your wives with a mix of envy and awe, as the trio of she-wolves were the only ones (save for you, of course) who hadn&#39;t reverted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night was glorious,&quot; you said to them. &quot;But the true glory will come as my gift is spread across the world. This is the dawning of our empire, and you are the first warriors.&quot; You saw confusion on the faces of a couple of the new males-the ones who&#39;d been turned by Lucia and Lira. &quot;For those who are not aware, I am Fenrir, the great wolf, and I will save mankind through the merging of man and beast into one perfect form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like in Norse mythology?&quot; one of the men asked. He was a college-aged guy, relatively fit. &quot;I thought you were just a wolf. Like, a big wolf. And you&#39;re the bad guy, if I remember right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Delia had been sitting at your feet, resting her head in your lap. But at this comment, she snarled, springing to her feet and darting to the crowd of followers, grabbing him by the throat. He slapped ineffectively at her muscled forearm, his eyes bugging out. She turned her head to look at you, waiting on permission to kill him for his insolence and blasphemy. <br />
<br />
Alice, the white wolf, let out a gasp. &quot;My lord..show mercy,&quot; she said. &quot;He chose his words poorly, nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Delia, my beloved,&quot; you said, &quot;we will show mercy today. This morning should be a time of celebration.&quot; Delia&#39;s grip loosened, and the man coughed and gasped for air. His eyes were wide with fear, and he started to step backward, clearly debating running from the temple and compound. &quot;Come here, boy,&quot; you said, your tone making it clear to your followers that while you were showing mercy, you were displeased, nonetheless.<br />
<br />
He timidly approached the elevated dais where your throne was positioned.  &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry..&quot; he said, his eyes fearfully darting between you and Delia who stood to his left, staring him down and clearly was looking for an excuse to kill him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re one of the freshly turned, and so I am willing to acknowledge this is a strange new world you find yourself in,&quot; you said to him. You could slightly sympathize; less than one day earlier you&#39;d simply been a man as well. &quot;However, in the future, do NOT refer to the stories about my existence as mythology. It&#39;s insulting. And most of what you&#39;ve read is little more than propaganda, written by followers of Odin, designed to slander my name and glorify their own. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded timidly. &quot;Uhh..yeah. Yeah. I do.&quot; He shifted his weight uncomfortably from foot to foot. <br />
<br />
Delia snarled, still not satisfied. &quot;Is that how you address a god?&quot; she said angrily. She lashed out, kicking the back of one of his legs and forcing him to a kneeling position. He whimpered, covering his head and waiting for another blow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; he said with fear in his quivering voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;My lord,&quot; Alice whispered more insistently to you. You surveyed the followers and saw fear on most of their faces. Whether it was fear of you or fear of Delia, you couldn&#39;t tell. Either way, a healthy amount of fear wasn&#39;t a bad thing. You were starting to remember how things were millennia ago, and how it helped keep things in check. Still, you knew that this wasn&#39;t the time for bloodshed, at least not yet, not amongst your followers, at the very least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Delia, come here, my beloved,&quot; you said softly. You smiled at her; her rage was on your behalf, you weren&#39;t upset with her in the slightest. She climbed the three steps up your dais and sat back down at your feet, laying her head in your lap once more, sighing as you stroked her fur affectionately. Alice relaxed a bit as well, nuzzling you gratefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen carefully, boy,&quot; you said, your tone mildly contemptful. It was deliberate, a signal to the rest of the followers that this new one wasn&#39;t owed respect or rank; he had transgressed, and would be punished, though he could earn back his place amongst the first-turned by proving loyalty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you think you know of me or whatever you have read, you know NOTHING.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded nervously, barely daring to look at you. &quot;Y-yes..yes my..my lord.&quot; Good. He WAS learning, albeit slowly.<br />
<br />
You addressed the throng again. &quot;All of you, hear my words. You know me, and now you will know my wives.&quot; This was a formality, but an important one. This solidified their rank and station among your first pack. You gestured to Rebecca. &quot;She is my voice. In my absence, you will take her words as my own. To disobey her is to disobey me.&quot;  You gestured to Alice. &quot;She is my conscience and my mercy. To find yourself in opposition to her is to find death.&quot; You gestured to Delia. &quot;And she is my passion. She is both my battle fury and my wild gift. Take care which side you provoke.&quot;<br />
<br />
The throng nodded, and your wives all beamed with pride. This was the culmination of years of loyalty. Of faith tested, then finally rewarded against all odds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; you said to them. &quot;You probably have never given much thought to the fact the moon is always full both here and in the city.&quot; The followers blinked, and even the kneeling fool seemed to blink in confusion, as though he himself had just realized that indeed, that WAS odd. &quot;It is old magic, remnants of the age where I was at the height of my power. This was the seat of my empire, an empire cut short, when the heavens themselves moved to my will. It is still mostly unnoticed by the rest of the world, and it is where the empire will be reborn as we prepare our first strike at the world. But for now, we must gather strength, and there is strength in numbers. Return to your homes and your jobs and your lives. Tonight, however, when the moon rises and the change is upon you, bring anyone in your home, young or old, into the pack, and then bring them here. Now go, and know that you are part of something far greater.&quot;<br />
<br />
They nodded, not quite in unison, but in comprehension of your command, turning and heading to their homes, and you noticed that the five the trio had brought back followed with them, pairing off with the cult members who they&#39;d mated with earlier. The timid man had found himself in the company of a surprisingly attractive blonde, who, much to your amusement, seemed rather annoyed with him. Good; the subtle signals you&#39;d sent clearly had been received.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you&#39;d let me kill him,&quot; Delia said, growling a bit.<br />
<br />
You let out a soft chuckle and scratched behind her ears. &quot;There will be time for blood in the days to follow, love. I promise you that.&quot;</p>
