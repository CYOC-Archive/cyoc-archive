<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mel dropped back into the chair as she broke out into a cold sweat. She expected pain, or discomfort, instead it felt good. Too good. She gasped as a shudder passed through her entire body. She felt an odd sensation from between her legs, she felt something taut and straining along with an unexpected tingling she had never felt before. She lowered her gaze and gasped softly.<br />
<br />
Sticking out from between her legs was a few inches of hard shaft, with it growing longer as she watched. She reached down and felt below the shaft, feeling only unbroken, wrinkled skin where her slit used to be, at least until a sharp but short pain made her gasp, the extra skin popping outwards as a pair of small testicles filled the waiting scrotum.<br />
<br />
Another wave of pleasure passed through her as he limbs and torso stretched, adding several inches of height to her once short frame. Even her hands a feet were stretching a widening, growing larger as her digits thickened, losing their feminine slenderness and the paint on her nails cracking and flacking away as her nails widened along with her fingers. She shifted in her seat from her shoulders spreading apart as her torso widened, widened but flattened, her nipples becoming smaller as her breasts seemed to melt away.<br />
<br />
Her chest didn&#39;t remain flat for long as it once more plumped outwards, though in a quite different shape, square slabs of muscle replacing what has one been soft, round breasts. Her arms and legs, longer but still slender, began to pack on muscle as well, her skin stretching taut displaying the hardened muscle beneath, even her abs tightened up, now clearly visible on her stomach.<br />
<br />
Even as the muscles continued to grow, they lost some of their definition as she grew the slightest hint of a gut, a little bit of fat padding her thick muscles that made her arms, thighs, and chest bulge.<br />
<br />
Her scalp tingled as her hair began to recede, lifting from brushing her shoulders, up past the tops of her ears until it was only an inch at the longest. Her face itched, making her reach up to feel stubble growing in along her jaw under her fingers. She winced slightly as the itching spread from there down her body. Her chest broke out in short brown hairs, covering her meaty pectorals and growing in a wave down her stomach. Her pubic bush grew wild as her cock finally seemed to stop growing in at what she guessed to be a rather impressive length and thickness, with a heavy set of balls to match. Finer hairs grew on her thighs and upper arms, before once more becoming thick on her forearms and lower legs, even her ass tingled and itched for a moment.<br />
<br />
he strange feelings left and Mel bounded out of her chair, her feet making much heavier thuds on the wooden floors of Skyler&#39;s apartment than she was used to making. But she went right to his bathroom, coming to a halt in front of the mirror to look at herself. There was still something of her in her face, the shape of her eyes, the arch of her brows, though those were now much thicker. Her nose was a similar shape, though larger. Though her face had lost all its femininity and roundness, and was now all hard angles, he jaw thick and square, under a short beard that was still brownish-red though heavily speckled with gray, especially on her chin and mustache. Her short hair was like was salted with gray, though gladly she noticed her hairline seemed to be holding and there was no sign of baldness. Her face did sport some wrinkles and creases, and she probably would have said the man in front of her was in his late forties.<br />
<br />
She ran her hands over her face and down her torso, the feeling of brushing her own body hair and odd sensation but one she admittedly didn&#39;t dislike. Overall, she seemed to have the look of a man who was an athlete or body builder in his early years, and still kept up his routine but didn&#39;t shy away from beers and pizza. Despite the slight gut, she could still feel the hardened muscle underneath when she flexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck. If Charlie doesn&#39;t let you pound his ass you can have mine.&quot; A voice said from the bathroom door, and Mel turned to look at Skyler who was almost drooling over her new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny.&quot; Mel said, her voice deep and gruff. She coughed, made a few throat clearing noises. &quot;Is that.. me? Wow.&quot; It resonated in the tile bathroom, deep and masculine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious.&quot; Skyler said. &quot;Those pills aren&#39;t cheap, it&#39;d be a nice way to thank me.&quot; He very unsubtly adjusted himself in his pants as he backed away to let Mel out of the bathroom. &quot;Okay, for your profile, I went with Mal, short for Malcolm. Seeing you I can enter a few more details. That&#39;s an eight incher if I&#39;ve ever seen one. Not as hung as Jason, but more than enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mal? Really?&quot; Mel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to keep it easy to remember. And try to think of yourself as a guy, the pill and hormones should make it easier, but you might slip up if you don&#39;t keep in character.&quot; He stepped up a bit closer to Mel, or Mal, using his own height to judge. &quot;6&#39;2&quot; I&#39;d bet, and for build we&#39;re putting muscle bear. Turns out you are a type of DILF he likes, I was worried you&#39;d end up more..&quot; He held his hand out in front of his stomach to demonstrate. &quot;But no, the little bit you&#39;ve got just gives off more dad vibes. Go stand over there, we need a profile pic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal moved to where Skyler indicated and stood there, making his friend frown. &quot;Show off a little, flex, pose, something.&quot; Mal rolled his eyes but did as instructed, lifting one arm into a flex. There was a camera noise from the phone. &quot;Perfect.&quot; Skyler turned the phone around to show him. The shot was focused on his torso, showing off his meaty, furry chest and stomach. He had cut it off right before the top of his dick, there was no question he was nude in that photo. It only showed off the lower half of his bearded face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Shouldn&#39;t you get more of.. me?&quot; Mal said, motioning to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, no one on these apps cares about that, and the only things they might care about more we can&#39;t show in profile pics.&quot; Skyler motioned to some clothing folded up on a chair that he must have placed there before coming to see Mal in the bathroom. &quot;It should fit. Might be tight, though, you&#39;re bulkier than I am on those pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have clothing just for that?&quot; Mal asked, picking up the sweat pants and tugging them on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, the pills last ten hours and sometimes we liked to go out. If you go on a date I might even be able to dress you up.&quot; Skyler tapped the phone screen a few more times. &quot;Muscle bear looking for clean cut younger guy to chat with, share pics, and potential casual hook ups.&quot; He continued to mutter, adding a few details that might more strongly indicate Charlie as Mal pulled on the tee that indeed was a little snug, but showed off his body nicely. &quot;And posted. So, how do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavy.&quot; Mal replied as he dropped down into the chair with a bit more oomph than he was used to. &quot;Actually, it feels kind of good. Though this cock is distracting. How do you deal with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Practice.&quot; Skyler said with a smile as Mal&#39;s phone let off a ding. &quot;Ooo.. your first bite&quot; He looked at the screen and grinned. &quot;Oh, he&#39;s cute. You should message him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal reached out a grabbed the phone, turning it over to look at the screen showing the profile of a 20-something bronze skinned surfer-type with bright blond hair. &quot;No, this is only for catching Charlie. Maybe I should message him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyler shook his head. &quot;Give it a day or two first, then reach out if he doesn&#39;t find you. I set your home as here and that app works off location, so you should enter his feed pretty quick.&quot; Sure enough, Mal could see Charlie&#39;s profile on his screen already as potential matches. It had a fake name, and didn&#39;t show his face, but he knew his husband&#39;s body, and the lean athletic torso with the light dusting of blond hair was definitely his. &quot;You know, they make shots to make this permanent now. Maybe you two will figure out you like it more this way.&quot; Skyler said teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doubtful.&quot; Mal said. His phone dinged again, and he ignored that one, too. That 19 year old red-headed twunk was definitely not Charlie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could always practice with some of those guys, you know. It might help, you need to come off the right way.&quot; Skyler noted as the phone dinged with another message from the surfer, this one attached with a pic of him smiling and squeezing his own pectoral. He was cute, Mal had to admit, and settled in to message with him a bit with Skyler providing tips. He felt awkward lifting the front of his shirt and tucking it under his chin to take another pic of his furry torso to send, but the eager reaction he got back made him chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, guess you&#39;re staying here tonight. You got another nine hours on that pill. We could settle in and watch a movie, or.. maybe go out and hit a bar..&quot; Skyler suggested with a grin. &quot;I got a pair of jeans that should show off that ass of yours nicely.&quot;</p>
