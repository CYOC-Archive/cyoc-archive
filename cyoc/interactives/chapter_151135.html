<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he was standing there pondering while waiting for his eyes to adjust, Jeff became aware of the intense smell again. He looked around standing in the upstairs hall. Everything is a hell of a mess! If he can see how much of a mess it is with his poor donkey eyesight, he could only imagine just how bad it actually was. With his enhanced sense of smell, he could tell it was horrendous. <br />
<br />
The thought of him lying in his own donkey bodily fluids quickly convinced him he needed a shower. And now! Besides, at least that way, he could begin to get some sort of headstart on cleaning up this mess before his parents got home. Assuming he could figure out how to repair his door frame and door all on his own before they got here in the 30 hours or so he had between turning back into a kid, and when his parents would arrive from their weekend outting. <br />
<br />
With mind made up, he sauntered over to his parents&#39; bedroom door. They had long, wide handles, one to each door facing eachother, that you had to pull down to push open from outside the bedroom. To Jeff, his parents&#39; bedroom doors always felt &quot;heavy&quot; to his scrawny little body. The doors themselves were heavy to begin with, but they had a strip thingy at the bottom that would also sort of drag across the thick carpet. It was meant to reduce any draft that would blow into their room from the front door at the base of the stair case, below and facing the room. <br />
<br />
But to Jeff the giant donkey jack, this would actually be a task that would be EASIER with this particular body! He put his jaw down on one of  the doors, and with very little effort at all, pushed it wide open. He pushed it so forcefully, not realizing his own new strength, that it actually SWUNG open despite the weight of the door and the friction on the carpet. Luckily, it stopped just before banging on the wall, creating yet more damage to the house. <br />
<br />
He then went to open the second door on his left. Same thing. Also luckily the doors would not swing shut again due to the physics of these particular doors. So he didn&#39;t have to juggle two doors at once, and he didn&#39;t have to worry about how he would manage to open them from the inside since they would need to be pulled.  Something he would have trouble doing with his current body. So he just simply wandered into their bedroom.<br />
<br />
Now, as a kid, he always loved the smell of his mother&#39;s perfume which seemed to permanently hang in the air in this room. As a donkey, it was a sharp, harsh chemical smell. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to breathe, with how horrible it was. But then, he had the idea that if his mother&#39;s perfume was pleasantly faint as a human kid and it was this badly strong as a donkey, maybe the smell in the house to a human wasn&#39;t as bad as he thought. He then figured that it must be the same difference as the difference between his sharp color-filled human eyesight to his poorl gray-filled donkey eyesight. So having to get the smell out once he turns back, may not be as bad as he thought. <br />
<br />
Shrugging his shoulders, if only mentally for he had trouble doing so physically as his arms were constantly being used as legs at the moment, he wandered towards his parents&#39; bathroom inside and to the right of the bedroom in order to get started. On the way there, he caught a glimpse of his dad&#39;s giant digital bedside clock. His dad always slept on the right side of the bed, closer to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s convenient,&quot; Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t see the numbers from his position. He had to move closer. Even though he was getting closer to the clock, the numbers were not appearing in his vision. The clock had an orange backlight with the numbers being black. To his colorless equine sight, it was just a grayish glow with faint blurry blackness where numbers should be in sharp contrast to the orange backlit glow.<br />
<br />
He got up real close, to see if he could make it out. Nope. Still blurry. He instinctively wanted to rub his eyes with his hands like you do when it is all watery and/or itchy that blurs your eyesight. But with legs that would refuse to bend up that high in that direction and unpliable hooves on the ends of those legs, it was physically impossible. <br />
<br />
He started feeling the panic begin to rise within him again. He pushed it back down with the thought that his condition was only temporary. But then the thought of: <br />
<br />
&quot;what if it wasn&#39;t temporary, and I&#39;m stuck like this forever?&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt the fear he would have of such a scenario from the safety of the knowledge that it wasn&#39;t permanant. But the thought forced his giant black floppy digit out of its leathery black home for at least the 6th time. This time, he WANTED to pleasure himself. <br />
<br />
He decided to do so in the bathroom, as the tiles would be much easier to clean than his parents&#39; nice carpet. And that&#39;s another thing to take note of: the lack of feeling the nice soft carpeting on his bare feet. He had always loved to go to his mom in her bedroom for many reasons. And one of those reasons was the nice, silky soft feel of the thick warm carpet on his smooth barefeet. But as a donkey, he doesn&#39;t get any of that pleasure through his stiff, hard, shiny hooves. <br />
<br />
Speaking of stiff and hard, the thoughts of his highly undesirable limited debasement was always making him hard and horny. He&#39;s a human with human thoughts and emotions inhabiting a big hairy smelly old donkey, unable to do normal human things. All the outside world would see of him is just a lowly old donkey. Not a person.<br />
<br />
Quickly making his way to the bathroom, he was able to easily open the extra wide door. He saw himself as a large dark blurry figure in the full sized mirror across the way upon opening the door. Mostly pitch black in here as well, with the exception of the small amount of gray light that was able to wend it&#39;s way from the hallway ceiling light.<br />
<br />
Now he has yet another light switch to contend with. &quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhaaaaeww,&quot; he exclaimed in his never-ending frustration. <br />
<br />
He walked fully into the bathroom and turned 180 degrees back towards the bedroom, hard hooves deeply clopping on the hard times surface of the floor. Moving forward and poking his nose out there the light switch should be, he managed to nail it with relative ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!&quot; he meant to say outloud. &quot;Haw!&quot; he actually said. His practice is beginning to make perfect. <br />
<br />
Now, to get a good look at himself. His parents had a really nice, really large bathroom. There was a large, wide alcove next to the vanity with full-body mirror on each of the three walls in the alcove. His mom would frequently use it to check herself out from multiple angles when going out for some dinner party or another. <br />
<br />
Curiousity got the better of Jeff. He wanted to take a look at what he actually looked like from different angles all at once. The mirror on the far wall facing the bathroom door, still showed a blurry gray shape. But he could make out the shape as being unmistakeably donkyish. There were the two really tall blurry thin triangles at the top of a blurry round head. The rest of his body extending out behind those basic shapes, was just a blurry blob. <br />
<br />
Heart beginning to race as he finally gets to face the music of his supposed humiliating appearance, he proceeded forward towards the alcove. He had to pass by the vanity, and got an excellent look at his head. What he saw looking back at him, was the large dark dull animalistic eyeballs attached to the face of an unmistable donkey head with hugely pointed ears extending more than a foot above its head. There was the long snout and muscular jaw line attached to a large neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhaaaaww!?&quot; he brayed out his question in wonderment if that was really what he looked like. He opened his mouth. The creature opened it&#39;s mouth. He saw huge blocky teeth justting out from it&#39;s dark upper lips in profile. Turning his head a bit further to the right (but not fully head-on where his large blind spot is located), in order to get the best possible look, he opened his mouth wider, making his thick black rubbery lips dance in the most hilariously silly manner. He could FEEL his own lips dance up like that! <br />
<br />
He bent his head downward. The creature did the same. He point his snout towards the ceiling. It copied him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That IS me! And I&#39;ve been calling that, my own reflection, &#39;it&#39; and &#39;creature&#39;! I&#39;m even looking at myself as a damn dull-minded silly donkey! That&#39;s all that any other human on the planet would think of me if they saw me at this moment. Even mom and dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reality of the situation began to really hit home upon seeing his own reflection. <br />
<br />
He then wanted to pleasure himself with that thought. But first, he had to humiliate himself to himself by checking out his entire body. His dick was properly pointed straight out for this occasion. And so, he wandered over to the alcove with the three mirrors to get a complete load of what he had done to himself for the next 11.5 hours with the chronivac.<br />
<br />
 (It was now 12:30 AM, but he did not know this. He was still confused as to what time it is.)</p>
