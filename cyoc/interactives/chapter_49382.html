<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Only when her parents answered &quot;transform&quot; to Bart's question did Kaylee rise up to her feet and moved to stand by Jensen. She didn't entirely like the fact that he had Jenny in his lap, but then her motives for sitting there were far more sexual then anything else. But,for the moment, her master was enjoying the transformation of her parents, so she contented herself to placing one paw-like hand on Jensen's shoulder and the other on her hip.<br />
<br />
Mark and Karen Perkins, meanwhile, nervously tried to back away. Their entire bodies were itching, which they guessed meant that their own fur was starting to grow. As with Kyle before them, their only thought was to escape, but the only avenue for that would require running past two adult wolf creatures and now two wolf pups that seemed to adore the ones that had robbed them of their humanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a monster!&quot; Mark growled at Jensen, missing the growling edge that his voice had taken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Join the club,&quot; Jensen shot back with a smirk.<br />
<br />
At that, Mark nervously looked down at himself and then at his wife. Reddish brown fur was growing rapidly all over them, and what looked like claws were growing from their fingernails. Mark could also feel his shoes constricting his feet, telling him that they were starting to lengthen. He wanted to fight, but for the moment the pain of the growing wolf feet in the constricting shoes was enough to stop him.<br />
<br />
Both he and Karen were soon pulling their shoes off, if only to kill the pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've got to fight this, fight him,&quot; Mark vowed once he got his shoes off, &quot;make him pay for what he's done to our son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't,&quot; Karen found herself whimpering, &quot;Kyle doesn't even want to be Kyle anymore... and we're already too far gone to be who we were...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark couldn't believe that his wife had given up so quickly. Despite everything that had happened, Mark wanted to fight for his freedom. When Karen spoke, he noticed what looked like the beginnings of wolf fangs growing in her mouth. They were rapidly becoming more and more wolf-like. As he realized this, Mark did get some sense of where Karen's defeatism was coming from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee, I believe you should help them out,&quot; Jensen spoke as he watched the two people change in front of him, his mate, and his transformed parents, &quot;They're looking rather uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, master,&quot; Kaylee nodded and moved forward, with Bart following curiously, clutching her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, don't you dare!&quot; Mark threatened as he tried to scoot away as Kaylee came closer, but suddenly realizing that his voice was getting higher.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Kaylee, &quot;dad&quot;,&quot; Kaylee spoke as she swung her hands down and cut through Mark's clothing, but doing &quot;him&quot; no harm, &quot;just as you will soon be Marcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you will be Kevin,&quot; Kaylee spoke to her mother as she removed her mother's clothing.<br />
<br />
Karen only whimpered as she was stripped naked by her own transformed offspring. Looking down, she only whimpered more. Her face was starting push out into a muzzle, and her breasts were gone and far more masculine looking chest was starting to develop. Further down, her hips were narrowing, and her clitoris looked like it was beginning change, enlarging to become the penis that wolf-boy, Bart, had cursed her to grow. She whimpered further as she felt her ovaries move inside her, sensing what they were becoming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry... Kevin,&quot; Jensen commented, &quot;in time you'll enjoy being a different gender. Kaylee and I aren't complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Monster!&quot; Mark growled again, sounding much more feminine and younger as well.<br />
<br />
Jensen only smiled as Kaylee returned to his side. Kaylee's parents had fully grown their muzzles, and their ears had moved to the tops of their heads. Both of them were also beginning to change genders and to regress slightly. Kaylee's father wasn't growing breasts, but his testicles had been pulled inside him and his penis was shrinking.<br />
<br />
Kaylee's mother was growing what was the beginnings of a penis and was developing some muscle mass. Jensen watched as the two transforming people turned and hugged. Probably for support. As they turned, Jensen noticed the tails starting to grow out behind them.<br />
<br />
Things were continuing to change physically for the Perkins. As Karen's penis formed and became covered in a furry sheath, Mark's vagina finished forming, cementing their new genders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will always love you,&quot; Marcy spoke weakly as she felt her body now beginning to rapidly shrink in size.<br />
<br />
She even saw it in Kevin. The two reddish brown wolves were now starting to regress in age. They would soon be physically seven years old. Kevin hugged his former &quot;husband&quot; tightly. He was scared, and knew that nearly all was lost. They had lost their humanity and now their genders. Only their age and their minds had left to be lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;So cute!&quot; Kaylee smiled, unable to contain herself as her parents continued shrink down and take on the appearance of wolf-pups.<br />
<br />
Jensen glanced over and shook his head. Kaylee seemed genuinely happy for her parents. Not that Jensen didn't like it though, he did like having his pack expand, but Jensen felt the greatest pleasure was in taking the Perkins' humanity from them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to like them?&quot; Jenny asked from Jensen's lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;they are part of the pack now and you and Bart's playmates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Jenny and Bart looked a little disgruntled at that, although, it seemed to be the look of an older sibling that was being told it had to like a younger sibling... but then, Marcy and Kevin looked like seven year olds in comparison to Bart and Jenny, who are nine year old pups.<br />
<br />
As Marcy and Kevin finished changing, Jensen set Jenny down. The female pup was quick to take Kaylee's hand as Jensen moved forward to test the coming mental changes.</p>
