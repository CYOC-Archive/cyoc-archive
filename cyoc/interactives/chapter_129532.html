<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler looked at the minotaur that was his best friend and finally sighed.  &quot;OK.  I&#39;ll try it.  But if I don&#39;t like it, you can make me normal, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad nodded.  &quot;Completely normal.  The Circe Camp folks would actually do it, but yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler looked up at Jared.  &quot;Come with me and watch, OK?  I stayed with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The huge bovine nodded and grunted.  The two of them started walking.  Tyler noted his parents made no move to follow.  It seemed they did not want to watch their only son become a beast.  The same might have been true for Jared&#39;s parents, but they seemed delighted when they saw the finished product.  &quot;Oh, Jared!  You&#39;re amazing!&quot;  His mother gushed.  &quot;If Tyler turns out half so well, I&#39;ll be thrilled.&quot;  Jared&#39;s father pointed to the corral, where one of their Clydesdale mares was snuffling the air and watching.  A wooden crate was nearby.  &quot;Go on in.  Part of the spell is mutual desire.  The mare will cooperate with you, help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler realized he was still naked and had not even thought about it.  Something had changed in his head, for sure.  Still, there was no point in delaying.  He had already mounted a donkey.  Given a choice, he&#39;d rather be a champion Clyde stallion.  <br />
<br />
Jared followed him to the gate, and then stood waiting, joined by his parents.  As soon as Tyler entered the corral, the mare snuffled the air and whinnied invitation.  Tyler shivered, already feeling the need, her scent teasing his nostrils.  He felt his donkey cock engorge, and his heavy black testicles pulsed.  The lust did not have the same strength as it had with the donkey, at least at first.  But as he got closer, two things happened.  His cock started to get even larger, and the mare&#39;s scent got stronger.  Tyler realized he was going from jackass to Clyde stallion, and both his and the mare&#39;s interest magnified.<br />
<br />
He was shaking with need now, and stumbled as he got up on the wooden crate.  The mare trotted around him, and then stopped to back up to the crate.  Her black cunt clenched and unclenched, &#39;winking&#39; at him at she lifted her tail up and squatted slightly.  Taking a deep breath, Tyler shifted, pointing his massive flare at the slick opening and braced himself as he thrust forward and the mare shifted back.<br />
<br />
Fucking the jenny had seemed intense, but now Tyler knew the magic had been saving him for this.  As soon as he entered the mare, his mind exploded.  Pleasure, desire, need, a sense of absolute purpose.  He cried out as his massive testicles throbbed and jerked, and then all too soon a jet of semen filled the mare.   For a moment, Tyler felt slightly cheated - Jared had mounted a dozen cows.  Then he felt himself stiffen again, recharged somehow.  The mare was ready for him, and he thrust back inside her.  He was vaguely aware of kicking the crate off tot he side, the solid earth under numbing feet, a growing sense of mass and strength.  But more than anything else, he was overwhelmed by a sense of accomplishment.  Nothing was more important that mating, passing his seed to a female.  Each eruption from his cock was the most important thing he had ever done in his life.  <br />
<br />
He came aware in the corral, panting, covered with sweat, the firm strength of Jared holding him against his side.  The minotaur had a strong animal smell that was somehow comforting at a primal level - friend, brother, companion.  He felt total trust for this bovine monster, and understood that the feelings were shared.   He had ended up a little taller than Jared, and examined himself.  Golden brown with thick white feathering, he looked like a Budweiser stallion reared up on its hind legs.  A trough reflected his magnificent equine head, and he felt a surge of pride.  He was the herd stallion, the best.<br />
<br />
The mare was being led away from the corral by Jared&#39;s father, semen running from her cunt in a steady stream.  Jared gave a deep chuckle.  &quot;I did many.  All yours in one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler struggled to reply.  He&#39;d thought that Jared&#39;s speech was affected by the bovine muzzle, but it was much more than that.  Or much less.  As in less words in his head, and a struggle to connect meanings.  Less intelligence?  That bothered him, but it made sense.  Mostly animal body, mostly animal brain.  He still remembered being human, but the magic had installed everything he needed to be a stallion as the first priority.  Jared must be bull first, human second.  <br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s parents nodded in satisfaction.  &quot;OK, Tyler.  Go clean up the stalls and then take it easy the rest of the night.  Jared, you head back to the cattle and do whatever your Master tells you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both former boys nodded to each other and started  their separate ways.  It was Tyler who caught himself as he entered the stable.  Cleaning up was not a problem - he knew exactly what to do.  It was that he felt almost compelled to obey.  He wanted to please the Masters.  Jared&#39;s parents.  The realization hit hard.  He and Jared were like trained animals, beasts on two legs.  Regardless of their claims, their parents had made them less than human, and were treating them as such.  It did not diminish the total sense of accomplishment that still hung heavy over his thoughts, but he understood that the base animal instinct had come at the cost of free will and intelligence.</p>
