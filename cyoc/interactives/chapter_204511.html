<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You do smell&quot; Harri gave Harpinder a quick peck, &quot;My smelly man.&quot; He smiled. Harri wanted to keep his new boyfriend transformed as long as he could, but he knew he would have to let the man take off his turban and clean up eventually. &quot;Go take a shower and I&#39;ll take our clothes to the laundry room.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing sex and you&#39;re doing the laundry? You&#39;re the best Babe! If I eat you out again tonight, can I get you to wash the dishes too?&quot; Harpinder joked. He unraveled his turban and tossed the rainbow fabric into their shared hamper. Then Harpinder&#39;s face became expressionless, like he was in a trance. He untied the magical black patka and set it on top of his dresser, letting his long black hair fall down. He then wrapped a towel around his naked waist and made his way to the dorm&#39;s communal showers. Harri loved watching Harpinder&#39;s muscles bulge as he walked away, even if his movements were a bit robotic in this state.<br />
<br />
<br />
Harri thought, (Harvey&#39;s notes said the only time he can take his patka off is to shower and sleep. That trance must stop him from throwing it away.) Harri inspected the cloth, even picking it up to feel it in his hands. Somehow it was still perfectly clean (It feels like normal fabric to me. All of that magic is coming from this little thing? Well, I better put it back in case it does something to me.) He placed the patka back on the dresser where Harpinder left it and carried their hamper to the laundry room. (Look at me, all domestic. Doing laundry for a boyfriend.) Harri giggled to himself. What was truly a relationship that only existed since last night, it now felt like they had been together for months. <br />
<br />
<br />
The differences between the two were noticable in the clothes Harri was tossing into the washing machine. Harri had bright colored turbans that he paired with equally vibrant button ups and pants. Harpinder instead wore mostly black turbans with dark athletic clothing. However, the two understood each other. Grabbing the rainbow turban from the hamper, Harri thought of the color he added to Harpinder&#39;s life. Allowing him to be sensitive and embrace his feminine side. In return, Harpinder showed Harri how to unleash his primal desires. Harri could still smell the dried sweat on his beard from last night. Looking at all of their clothes, there were so many fabrics that could possibly change Harpinder next. Then he pulled out his cum stained turban from last night. (I wonder what would happen if I put one of my turbans on him, especially one covered in my cum) Harri giggled again (maybe an experiment for another time) he threw the it in the wash with the rest and pressed start. (I&#39;m too excited to get back home! I&#39;ll just do a quick cycle this time.) Minutes later, the machine chimed and Harri transferred their clothes to the dryer. &quot;Hm? What happened to...&quot; He grabbed the rainbow turban, except it wasn&#39;t a turban anymore. &quot;It&#39;s a pride flag again? Does that mean Harpinder- no, Harvey has changed back?&quot; Looking at the rest of the wash, Harvey&#39;s clothes had reverted, confirming Harri&#39;s thoughts.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
Harpinder was soothed by the warm water showering on his head. It washed away the fog from his brain, releasing him from both his trance and the mental changes. &quot;Huh? Oh, it&#39;s shower time again. That stupid trance gets so disorienting.&quot; Harvey applied body wash to his massive pecs. (Wait, meaty pecs?) He thought before looking down at his muscle bound body. &quot;Holy-! I&#39;m huge!&quot; He exclaimed into the echoing showers. (And hairy... Hey! It&#39;s not just my muscles that grew. Little Harvey ain&#39;t so little) he laughed to himself. (Fuck, this is a man&#39;s body. This change isn&#39;t so bad) he flexed and posed, loving the strength he felt in his constricting muscles. (When did I change? It must have been after my date with Rupi. Man, if she saw me like this instead of that nerd, we would have done more than just kiss. What did I do last night then?) Harvey pondered for a moment before the memories of last night crashed against his mind like a wave. He felt weak in the knees despite his thick legs. Leaning one hand hand on the tile wall for support, the other hand covering his gagging mouth. It was all he could do to stop himself vomiting. (I licked my room mate&#39;s ass!? What the hell is wrong with me!) Harvey stood like that in the shower for what dragged on for minutes. His body slowly changed back into its slim white form. Once he regained his composure, he was extra thorough with washing his body, especially his face and dick. He needed to wash away Harri&#39;s touch. Finished with his almost hour long shower, Harvey fell back into a trance and headed back.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Harri was disappointed to see that their dorm was back to normal, though that was to be expected once Harvey changed back. (Where is Harvey anyway? He can&#39;t be showering this long.) As if on cue, Harvey in his tranced state walked in. It was funny for Harri to see Harvey with such long brown hair flowing down. The guy used to take so much care of having the perfect gelled hair style. Though the long hair made sense with with having to wear a patka. Harvey tied the black cloth on himself and awoke from his trance. &quot;Good morning, Roomie&quot; Harri greeted, &quot;You came just in time for fresh clothes.&quot; He pointed at their now separate, smaller hampers. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks&quot; Harvey walked to his hamper with his head facing away in shame. He wasn&#39;t able to look at Harri anymore without the images of the previous night.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; Harvey sternly replied with a tight grip on the towel around his waist, &quot;It&#39;s just... do you mind waiting outside while I change?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? It&#39;s just us guy&#39;s here, Harv. When did you get so shy?&quot; Harri joked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Harvey still had his back facing Harri, but Harri didn&#39;t&#39;t need to see Harvey&#39;s expression to hear the irritation in his voice, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be naked around you, Harri.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, as if I&#39;d be interested in looking at you&quot; Harri joked again. (There&#39;s definitely something wrong with Harvey) Harri thought. (I don&#39;t know what I did to make him upset. Oh well, I know how to make him happy to see me again. As long as he&#39;s looking away, this next step should be easy.) Harri grabbed the pride flag from his hamper and threw it into Harvey&#39;s head. <br />
<br />
<br />
(Oh no! I&#39;m changing again already?) Harvey instantly recognized the feeling of changing. Once again he grew into the 6&#39;3&quot; muscular version of Harpinder. He and Harri watched as their apartment changed with the new reality in real time. Their bed frames slid together to support their shared mattress. A photo of them kissing was framed on top of their shared dresser. Harpinder&#39;s smart watch was charging next to his bracelets on the desk where he and Harri of sat and studied together. Harpinder&#39;s laptop was opened on one of his marketing assignments, where he chose to do a case study on marketing to LGBTQ youth. Harri&#39;s laptop was on his screen saver which held even more photos of the happy couple.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, I&#39;m so happy you wanted to wear my gift again&quot; Harri smiled innocently, as if he hadn&#39;t forced the rainbow fabric onto Harpinder. &quot;I&#39;m glad I was able to wash it before you got back.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Harpinder looked down at his perfect six pack stacked above his towel. (Damn, I&#39;m in the same form as this morning! Which means I&#39;m wearing that pride turban again.) &quot;Yeah, sure, it&#39;s a fun gift&quot; Harpinder rolled his eyes. &quot;But maybe you can help me change into something else?&quot; He suggested, hoping Harri would help him remove the turban.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to help you change&quot; Harri grinned and ripped the towel off of Harpinder, leaving the bigger man completely naked except for his turban!<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Harri!&quot; Harpinder exclaimed, mortified, covering his crotch with his hands as quick as he could.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s shy this morning&quot; Harri teased. &quot;Catch!&quot; He tossed a muscle shirt, athletic shorts, and kachera underwear, which Harpinder caught with both hands. With Harpinder&#39;s hands occupied, Harri took the opportunity to grip the strong punjabi&#39;s uncut cock.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh~!&quot; Harpinder&#39;s head shot back in elation, moaning to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There, doesn&#39;t that feel better than hiding it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
(No!) He wanted to shout! But only a soft &quot;yeees&quot; escaped his thick lips. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We can have some fun before you get dressed. Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?&quot; Harri&#39;s tender touch continued to plump Harpinder&#39;s dick in its dark sheath.<br />
<br />
<br />
(No!) &quot;Oh Waheguru! Yes Harri&quot; he sang. (I usually have more control when I&#39;m aware of my changes! Why is this happening!? It&#39;s like I&#39;m talking with my dick instead of my brain)<br />
<br />
<br />
Harri let go of Harpinder&#39;s shaft, &quot;How about a kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Harpinder spat!<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what?&quot; Harri recoiled at his boyfriend&#39;s sudden anger. <br />
<br />
<br />
Harpinder finally got his voice back, but he still wasn&#39;t happy about what he said. For some reason it pained him to see Harri so hurt. He calmed down and sighed, &quot;I mean, you&#39;re still covered in sweat from last night. You should shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, haha, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; Harri smiled again, &quot;well you stay excited and I&#39;ll be back soon&quot; he playfully poked Harpinder&#39;s hairy pec before grabbing a towel and heading to the showers.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great...&quot; Harpinder faked a smile. (I need to get away from Harri. But if I go out in public, who knows what this body will make me do? Still, if I stay in this dorm, Harri will want to have fun with me when he gets back. I could go to class, but I have religious studies and international business today, and I want to avoid members of the Sikh Student Coalition like Gurpreet and Mandeep. Since I&#39;m transformed, it might be a good time to meet with Gursewak and see if we can learn more. We could ask Satvinder for more of his expertise on transformation media too. Then again, it wasn&#39;t much help last time. Should I try to meet with Rupi instead? I bet she would love this hot Punjabi body. But if I&#39;m gay in this reality, will I even still be attracted to her? Uhg, all of these plans have major drawbacks! What should I do?)</p>
