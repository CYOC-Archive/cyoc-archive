<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach looked at Jennifer quizzically. &quot;Transform?&quot; he half-said, half-asked, wondering what she was playing at. Jennifer grinned happily at him. The effects of the curse had kicked in on her and made her look forward to doing this, even though deep down she knew it was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; she said brightly. &quot;Well, you need to give milk, so I think rather than a cow, you should transform into a cow centaur. You'll stay yourself from the waist up, and become a functional, lactating dairy cow from the waist down. A Holstein, I think, I read somewhere that they give the most milk. And lets make it so that your milk will transform people who drink it into cow centaurs as well, just like you.&quot; She paused and thought, then continued &quot;Wait, on second thought, your milk will change those who drink it into cow centaurs, alright, but their milk won't have any transforming effect. We don't want the whole world changing, do we? And, whenever you try to say the word transform you'll moo instead.&quot; <br />
<br />
She stopped talking and looked at Zach, who was staring at her in bemused wonder. Shaking her head, she felt the influence of her curse wane as she had met the conditions. &quot;Oh, God, Zach. I'm sorry, the curse made me do it!&quot; He looked back at her for a moment, wondering what she meant, but abruptly felt his body start to tingle oddly.<br />
<br />
The change was rapid. Accompanied by ripping cloth, his lower body below the waist expanded hugely, extra legs grew, black and white fur sprouted, a tail shot out, and finally as he stood on his four new cloven hooves, an enormous heavy udder dropped into place between his hind legs.<br />
<br />
Jennifer gazed at him in horror and disbelief. &quot;Oh my God&quot;, she breathed once more, her hands over her mouth. Zach was looking down at his new body in amazed terror, twisting around at the waist to look behind himself at the cow body stretching away to the rear. Experimentally taking a step forward he winced at the clatter of his hooves on the tile floor. His udder bounced and swung, and he bent to the side and stared at it in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell have you DONE to me?&quot; he cried out, awkwardly and slowly walking towards her. She held out her hands to him helplessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry! I couldn't stop myself, the curse wouldn't let me. Damn that Kyle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle? Kyle Perkins? He's responsible for this? I'll kill the little bastard.&quot; Zach was getting better at moving around, but the sound of his hooves and the swinging of his huge udder underneath him was getting annoying. Jennifer nodded, and explained what had happened the day before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the only way to change back is to pass the curse to someone else, and have them give it back to you&quot;, she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK, then, MOOOOooooo! or dare&quot;, he said, surprised at the cowlike noise he involuntarily made. He tried again. &quot;MOOOOOoooOOo or dare?&quot; Jennifer looked upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won't work&quot;, she sobbed. &quot;Remember? You can't say that word, you can only moo. And the curse won't work unless you can say transform. I couldn't help it, the dare made me say all those things and now I think you're stuck like this.&quot; Zach looked at her, appalled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I'm going to be half-cow forever? I can't stay like this! How am I going to do anything? I can't play football, I can't even get into my car, I must weigh half a ton. And what am I going to eat?&quot; He shifted his hindquarters uncomfortably. There was an unfamiliar sensation back there, concentrated around his udder.<br />
<br />
Jennifer slumped into an armchair. &quot;I don't know what to do. Kyle forced me to change you into something that gave cow's milk, and this is what you ended up with. I have to take a bucket of milk to him tomorrow morning, or else he'll do something to me, I think there's still a condition active on the curse he gave me.&quot; Zach looked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give milk?&quot; He shifted his hind legs again, his udder was really feeling uncomfortable. it suddenly struck him why. &quot;Oh, shit. That's why I feel like this, I need to be milked. I can't believe it.&quot; They both stared at his large dangling udder, and he shook his hindquarters from side to side experimentally. The massive bag of flesh swung heavily from side to side, bouncing up and down a little. It was obviously full.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stood up, and retrieved a gallon-sized plastic bucket from the kitchen along with a couple of towels. &quot;Well, I guess I'd better get on with it&quot;, she sighed. &quot;You're like this because of me, I should do the work. I just hope I can figure out how.&quot; Sitting crosslegged on the floor near his udder, she placed the bucket under the large mammary and grabbed a couple of huge nipples one in each hand. <br />
<br />
Zach jumped at the sensation. &quot;Fuck. Your hands are cold!&quot; She smiled slightly at him, and experimentally pulled one nipple. Zach squeaked at the odd feeling. It was quite nice and incredibly odd at the same time.<br />
<br />
After some effort, and looking up milking cows on the internet, she finally figured out how to make it work. Milking him took quite a long time, and filled the bucket half a dozen times. She dumped most of the milk down the sink, only keeping the last one. &quot;Well, that should be enough&quot;, she exclaimed, wiping her hands on a towel. &quot;It'll keep until tomorrow, I'll put it in the fridge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach was standing beside the computer desk in the corner of the living room, where they'd moved while looking up the procedure for milking cows. He'd been reading about cows, the care and feeding of, and had come across something that made him gasp. &quot;Oh, hell&quot;, he moaned. She looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;, she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know that dairy cows need to be milked at least twice a day?&quot; he said dismally. &quot;I'm going to have to go through this twice a day for the rest of my life! I can't live like this!&quot; She jumped up and ran around to his forward end, reaching up and putting her arms around his neck. It was a reach, as he was nearly seven feet tall as a cow centaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be here for you. It's my fault, and you'll need me.&quot; He leaned down and kissed her on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not your fault, it's Kyle's. And I'm going to get him for it.&quot; She nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have our chance tomorrow morning. I'll give him the milk and then once I'm free of him, he's all yours.&quot;</p>
