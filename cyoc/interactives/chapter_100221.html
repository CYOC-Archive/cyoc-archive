<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the Stovalls prepared to leave their house to go out to eat, Martin Stovall said, &quot;Now remember, while this is a celebration, we have to keep the reason just between the three of us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay dad,&quot; agreed his daughter Julie, while getting into the back seat and putting on her seat belt. &quot;Mom, before bedtime, can we talk some more about... what is going to happen?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure sweetie,&quot; agreed Melissa Stovall. &quot;Any time. It&#39;s a big step in any lady&#39;s life and we want you to be as prepared as possible.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks mom,&quot; said Julie. Then, as the family car began to pull out of the driveway, she had a sudden revelation. <i>Seven HOURS? Why did I say that? Guess I&#39;m starting to lose it around Eric as much as he is around me. Whenever we&#39;re supposed to get intimate and induct him into were-mer society, I hope it&#39;s soon.</i><br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Okay. Chicken&#39;s on. Potatoes are done. Why don&#39;t you take a quick shower while we handle the rest of things in here?&quot; suggested Samantha Twist to her son Ben.<br />
&quot;Okay. I suggested to Kenya to be here around 6:30, although it would probably be closer to 7 before we actually eat,&quot; he said, looking at the wall clock that said it was only 5:55. &quot;I&#39;ll be back soon, and thank you,&quot; Ben added, giving both Samantha and Frances a quick peck on the cheek before leaving.<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Samantha asked her wife when they were alone.<br />
&quot;This Kenya must be someone special, at least to Ben, for him to go all out like this,&quot; observed Frances.<br />
&quot;I got that. But the only Kenya I can recall was part of a family of werepanthers I welcomed, who moved here from the East Coast over the summer. I think their ancestors were originally from Africa, or someplace in that part of the world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Would it bother you if our son had an inter species, let alone an interracial relationship?&quot; asked Frances, looking directly at Samantha.<br />
&quot;No. What I would be concerned about is the fact that the Kenya I&#39;m thinking of is in college,&quot; revealed Samantha.<br />
&quot;Even if we&#39;re talking about the same Kenya, does an age difference matter between weres?&quot; asked her wife, as she started grabbing plates to set the table.<br />
&quot;Ben&#39;s 16. The Kenya I&#39;m thinking of is 20-something. If they are the same person, how should I feel about it, let alone, how do you feel about it?&quot;<br />
Frances stood there, looking at Samantha, wondering what she did think about that. Then Frances gave Samantha the only answer she had.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to ask me that question after I&#39;ve met her.&quot;<br />
<br />
NEXT DOOR...<br />
After being dropped off by Ben, Alex Ramsey followed his boyfriend Nate Anderson into his house. In typical 16 year old teenager fashion, they raided the fridge for a snack, then went upstairs to Nate&#39;s room and started tackling their homework.<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t we get homework in one of the easy subjects, like art or gym?&quot; asked Alex, frustrated over how his science assignment was turning out.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong handsome?&quot; asked Nate, using his pet name for Alex as he left his desk to sit on the bed next to his beau.<br />
Alex began reading from the worksheet. &quot;Why was Pluto downgraded to dwarf planet status after decades of being considered otherwise?&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric was complaining about that when it happened,&quot; recalled Nate, &quot;but you&#39;ll have to come up with a better worded answer than &#39;a bunch of eggheads got together and changed the planetary consideration standards&#39;.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sometimes I can just breeze through an assignment or a subject. Other times...&quot; complained Alex, as he leaned back against Nate&#39;s mattress.<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; asked Nate, as he carefully and quietly started collecting Alex&#39;s stuff and setting it in his desk chair.<br />
&quot;The things I love, like cooking, I just want to learn all I can. The other things, I just want to be over and done with them as soon as possible,&quot; admitted Alex, staring at the ceiling.<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;re all like that to some extent,&quot; agreed Nate, as he laid on the bed next to his boyfriend. &quot;But if I&#39;ve learned anything from having teachers for parents and a brianiac for a younger brother, it&#39;s that you need a good education if you want to succeed in life.&quot;<br />
&quot;I agree with that. Maybe what I need right now is a study break,&quot; realized Alex, as he turned his head to kiss Nate.<br />
&quot;I can help with that handsome,&quot; said Nate, as he moved to lay on top of his lover&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Soon both boys were topless as Nate started working his way down Alex&#39;s waist, kissing a trail to his belt buckle. A slight pause to open his pants and pull everything down below Alex&#39;s knees, and soon Nate had his boyfriend&#39;s cock deep in his mouth as he sucked on the shaft and lovingly caressed Ramsey&#39;s balls.<br />
&quot;Oh Nate! You keep that up stud and I&#39;m gonna start going furry on you,&quot; announced Alex, as he pulled Nate off his cock to kiss him.<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s get naked and do this right,&quot; said Nate with a smile.<br />
<br />
In less time than it takes to tell, both totally bare teenagers were soon laying across Nate&#39;s full size bed as they assumed a sixty-nine position, each orally making love to the other&#39;s shaft.<br />
Fur began to spread across their bodies as their were libidos kicked in, releasing their inner werewolves, eager to sate their sexual hunger for each other.<br />
Nate got curious and paused to sniff Alex&#39;s hind quarters with his heightened lupine senses. The combined aroma of werewolf musk, testosterone, and lupine pheromones was a heady mixture that inflamed his passions even further, driving him to make Alex&#39;s red rocket explode in his muzzle before Nate&#39;s own shaft came within Alex&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Hornier now than he was before, Alex needed no encouragement to reposition himself on all fours. Anxious for what was about to happen, Alex eagerly raised his tail as Nate drove his now much longer lupine cock deep into his boyfriend&#39;s werewolf anus, pleasurably pounding away long after both of them had experienced several mutual orgasms together.<br />
Spent, with his red rocket still buried well within his boyfriend, Nate laid on top of Alex and put his furry arms around his beau, playfully nuzzling his lover&#39;s furry neck and ears as Alex said, &quot;Soon as I&#39;m rested, it&#39;s my turn next.&quot;<br />
Nate&#39;s only response to that was a low growl of pleasure as he moved his hips just enough to remind Alex where he was at the moment.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The boys had been home since about 4:15.<br />
Homework had been set aside for passion a little after 5.<br />
Now as it approached 6 that evening, the Anderson family car was pulling into the driveway as Eric Anderson was walking past the Twists&#39; house, waving at his folks as they got out of their automobile.</p>
