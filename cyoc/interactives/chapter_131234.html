<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While certain elements of the Spring Fair&#39;s focus on Medieval European history was not particularly intriguing to the Five Elements, they did have to admit that the people of Lyre and Animalia had been kind to them, which was something they hadn&#39;t seen in quite a long time. They also noticed on how confident all the Animalians were as they moved about the arena. They walked in total faith and security that no one would threaten them, and from what the Elements could see, no one did. They were also quite impressed with Animalia&#39;s three Sauropods who came in while they made their run through the booths that made up the fair.<br />
<br />
Andrew, Luke, and Marjorie were polite as any other Animalian had been to them, but they also towered over everyone at the fair. Luke and Marjorie, being Diplodocus Dinotopians, also had to be wary of their tails to make sure they didn&#39;t accidentally smack anything with them. Though, what really captivated much of the attention of the Elements was the musculature and other features on them, particularly on Andrew and Luke. It came as a big surprise that those desirous thoughts even came to them, given the abuse they&#39;d gone through, especially with the realization that even Shuixing, the largest of the Elements, was too small to fit the two Sauropod Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the meeting was polite and Tuxing was able to keep some composure over her sisters to let them move along. That, however, did take them out of the main arena area. As they came out into one of the hallways they looked around to see that they also extended into the rest of the building as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what else is here?&quot; Huoxing wondered to Ping as they looked up and down the entryway they were near. It wasn&#39;t the main entryway and there were a couple of building maps that were set up, but since they were written in English there was some level of translation that they would need Ping for to read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the rest of this building is devoted to fitness and exercise,&quot; Ping answered, &quot;They have gyms, pools, and other facilities that help Animalians relax and stay in shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pools,&quot; Tuxing and Shuixing said together with somewhat bright eyes. The two then looked to each other for a few moments before Tuxing spoke, &quot;We shall need to acquire swimsuits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing eagerly nodded while the others looked to Ping who looked on with amusement. Eventually she did speak again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Parts of the second level also include office areas for various combat sports leagues in Animalia, which are totally free to join,&quot; Ping spoke in a calm and explaining tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they show Martial Arts expeditions?&quot; Jinxing wondered. They all looked good, and she personally felt that she and Tuxing would be quite graceful and that would reinforce many of the lessons they&#39;d had before they were captured by the cult, and of course with their greater strength and added natural weapons as Animalians, there were some ideas that floated around the back of her head in that regard. They weren&#39;t exactly masters and the fact that many of the Martial Arts teachers in Animalia were Japanese was different, but that didn&#39;t mean that the Snow Leopard Animalian didn&#39;t have an idea or two.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do,&quot; Ping nodded, &quot;though that is done in a combined coordination between the local dojos/training halls to help teach self discipline and with the UFC for the use of the arena.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UFC?&quot; Muxing asked, grateful that spelling that out didn&#39;t result in her hissing too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;It stands for Ultimate Fight Championship,&quot; Ping answered, &quot;It&#39;s a mixed Martial Arts combat sports league based out of Las Vegas that has branched out to include Animalia, UFC-A and the Dinotopians and Cenozoic Animalians in the Mesozoic Fight Club... though much of that is in direct combat... though as a sport more than unleashing rage and anger on someone. If you wish to sign up... I think they would be fine with you participating in the actual Martial Arts expeditions, but any participation in combat sports would be prohibited until Animalia is certain that you aren&#39;t still suffering from any mental stresses from your captivity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental stressssssesssss?&quot; Muxing hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Animalia Virus heals a lot, but not everything,&quot; Ping answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will be fine with participating in displays of martial arts skills,&quot; Tuxing spoke calmly and with some measure of authority in her voice. She knew that Shuixing at times felt uncomfortable in relation to her appearance and that Muxing wanted to essentially make the people that had held them prisoner pay for what they did, but while Tuxing had no ambition on being the five&#39;s leader, she had found that the others often deferred to her, even Shuixing who had gained a lot of confidence in seeing how strong she&#39;d become. &quot;There is no need to lose self discipline.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others eventually nodded and Ping lead them to a nearby flight of stairs, which looked like they were literally carved out of stone and were heavily reinforced. None of the Elements had any experience with architecture, but they were impressed with the quality of the work as they made their way up. Muxing had a little difficulty as she was getting used to movement without legs and that sometimes that did create some issues, but even she managed. She eventually managed to make her way onto the railing and found she could use the handrail as a ramp, which had been getting easier as she got more used to her serpentine body.<br />
<br />
They made their way up onto the second level and followed Ping as she made her way toward some of the UFC-A offices where they were soon met by seeing a Styracosaurus Dinotopian, Brett Horne, coming up from another set of stairs  from the main entrance area with a small group of males following him, most were lizards, but one appeared to be a turtle and another appeared to be a shark, Amos, Buford, Esteban, and Larry. Anton was also with them, but he&#39;d come along more as a guide than one actually signing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;UFC-A will have some paperwork for you all to sign before getting into anything more,&quot; Brett spoke, &quot;and there will be some sorts of &quot;training&quot; videos to go through as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;ll stick with teachin&#39;?&quot; Amos asked over his shoulder to Anton.<br />
<br />
Anton nodded and then noted Elements approaching slowly. He didn&#39;t recognize them, but he did notice the mixed curiosity that the five had as they looked around the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, Amos,&quot; Anton answered, &quot;As I said before, it&#39;s fun. Though, I think you might have some others...&quot;<br />
<br />
Anton then gestured to the elements who approached with Ping as their guide. They ultimately approached Brett and it was Tuxing, through Ping, who spoke first.<br />
<br />
&quot;You represent the UFC-A?&quot; Tuxing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brett said slowly, &quot;and once they have enough members... a competitor for the Mesozoic Fight Club...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be tough with all those horns!&quot; Huoxing commented cutting him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, only my nose horn is really functional as a weapon,&quot; Brett gave a chuckle, &quot;the horns on my frill might make it difficult for the Tyrannosaur relatives to get at the back of my neck... but a lot of the frill is actually rather open to save on weight. As such, only the nose horn is really anchored well enough to use in a charge or to &quot;fence&quot; with. Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Tuxing spoke, &quot;I am Tuxing, these are my sisters, Huoxing, Jinxing, Shuixing, and Muxing. We have some interest in working with some of the local... dojos... with regard to martial arts demonstrations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Show skill and discipline?&quot; Brett asked after Ping gave the translation, guessing that they had limited knowledge of English.<br />
<br />
Tuxing nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll actually be a different set of papers from these guys who are looking to compete with each other and others for the standard UFC-A matches,&quot; Brett answered as he shook Tuxing&#39;s paw, &quot;Do you know the dojo or school you&#39;ll be with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are staying in an area that has a lot of Animalians that either came from China or were humans that had come from China,&quot; Tuxing spoke, &quot;So a lot of our training will be in various Chinese disciplines... though some of the names in Animalia are still very new...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett chuckled and nodded, &quot;They gave me a book to keep track of all the various schools in that regard. Come in... I&#39;m afraid my office won&#39;t have enough chairs for everyone to sit...&quot; He then paused to look over to Amos, Esteban, Larry, and Buford, &quot;...but I&#39;m sure you four will be perfect gentlemen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four males chuckled and Anton gave a small wave as Ping lead the Elements into Brett&#39;s office. It was a slightly different meeting from what he expected with Animalia and Lyre&#39;s Easter break coming up, but he did see it as an over all picture of things going well. And while the Elements would have plenty of work to improve their English skills and help Muxing avoid hissing out words, there was the hope that things would continue to go well. With his work done, Anton decided to head back down to the lobby where he&#39;d get a veggie drink before getting ready to walk home.</p>
