<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty leered at Andrea, his boner prominent. All these new straight thoughts were hard to sort out. Without looking up from her breasts, he said &quot;Well come on then, will you go out with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, no,&quot; she said. &quot;You're like, way too young for me AND you're a perv.&quot; She laughed at him and his huge boner and walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Andrew said. &quot;You just got rejected. Why you gotta show me that thing? Cover yourself up.&quot; He threw a pillow at Ty. &quot;Why are you macking on my sister anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty didn't realize it, but he still had the increased courage to say and do what he really wanted to. &quot;Because she's hot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, she's my SISTER. Stop talking like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty was pretty embarrassed. &quot;Man, I'm sorry. I wish you knew how she made me feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them felt momentarily light headed. Andrea walked by the room again, glared at Ty and muttered &quot;Gross perv.&quot; Ty looked away, but when he looked at Andrew again, he realized Andrew was still staring after Andrea, lost in a trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew shook his head and turned red. &quot;No-nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you've been acting like this for a while. What's your problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOTHING man.&quot; Andrew had a huge boner and he rushed to hide it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now who's gross man?&quot; Ty tossed the pillow back at him, both of them sporting huge boners. It was pretty awkward for two straight teenaged boys to be getting hard in each other's presence. Andrew had been acting weird and not talking to him much. They had been best friends and he wanted to know what was up. He was starting to get pissed. &quot;I wish you just had the guts to tell me what was wrong, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew's eyes brimmed over with tears and he immediately began telling him everything. How recently, he'd been having strange feelings for his sister. Dreams where he'd do things with her, and wake up and have, well, you know. Ty was horrified, but he tried not to be too judgemental.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... she's your sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I don't know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not even that hot. She looks kinda like you, only with breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made Andrew laugh. &quot;Maybe I'm just too horny lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed too. &quot;Seriously man. If I gotta think about a brother and sister getting it on, I wish they were WAY hotter than you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality shifted again. Ty blinked twice and when he looked up Andrew was wiping the tears from his intense blue eyes, looking forlorn. He was easily one of the best looking guys in school, with a tight muscular body, sandy blonde hair, and a face by turns cherubic and by turns dangerous. He and his sister were too of the most popular kids in school, and he only let Ty hang around because he liked the hero worship. Ty immediately began to be filled with feelings of jealousy for Andrew. He wanted to be just like him when he got older, but he felt like he never would, with his genetics.<br />
<br />
Andrea walked in the room. &quot;You know, Andrew, why do you hang out with that perv anyway?&quot; She looked at her brother strangely and stood in front of him with her hands on her hips. With her voluptuous curves and long blonde hair, Andrea was easily hotter than any girl at school.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's cool. Leave him alone, Andrea.&quot; Andrew blushed and hid behind the pillow again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, man.&quot; She licked her lips and put her hand on his shoulder. &quot;Just don't hang out with him too much, I worry about you.&quot; She turned around and walked out, her hot ass swaying back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Don't you get it, dude?&quot; Even his voice and speech patterns were changed. He sounded sexier now. More confident, even in this moment of breakdown.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's the hottest girl in school, man. I don't blame you.&quot; Ty had noticed something though. Andrea had undoubtedly been flirting with Andrew. The jealousy surged again. Of course she was flirting with him. They were the hottest kids in school. Why wouldn't they desire them. Ty silently wished that he was as hot and popular--no, hotter and more popular than Andrew, the most popular and hottest guy in the junior year. Then Andrea would want him.<br />
<br />
Reality shifted again. Andrea walked--more like glided into the room, poured into her clothing. Ty stood up to greet his girlfriend. She couldn't get enough of his hot body, hard from years of football and wrestling. She looked up into his endless green eyes and ran her hand through his shaggy black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, you're so hot. I never get over it.&quot; She kissed him deeply, and he smiled. &quot;I'll be back in a bit.&quot; She sauntered out, jangling her car keys.<br />
<br />
Ty sat back down. He's been dating Andrea for two years and Andrew's revelation was new to him. &quot;Sorry you had to see that man, especially after you admitted that to me. I'm gonna help you work through this though. We're buds. I'll stand by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew cracked a lopsided grin. &quot;Thanks man. Glad you have my back. Too bad I wasn't born gay, right? Then I wouldn't be so fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled, but inside his morals were in turmoil. He silently added, &quot;I wish you HAD been born gay... then we'd be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality shifted. Ty was still sitting on the bed with Andrew, but he was a little farther away, keeping a distance. He'd always had his suspicions, but it was weird to hear it out loud. &quot;Sorry man,&quot; He said. &quot;I'm gonna help you work through this though. We're buds. I'll stand by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew cracked a lopsided grin through his tears. &quot;Thanks man. Glad you have my back.&quot; Andrew had been in love with Ty since they met two years ago, but lately it had been pure torture to be around him. Finally Ty had confronted him and said &quot;I wish you had the guts to tell me what was wrong&quot; and he finally told him he was gay and in love with him. Of course, he'd been rejected, but at least he'd finally put it out in the open.<br />
<br />
&quot;But no more of that love you shit man, okay? We're football buds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew blushed. &quot;Yeah man, I'm sorry. I'll get over it.&quot; But he was still feeling strangely confident. &quot;Just not any other gay football players who are as hot as you, you know? It'll be hard to find another guy who wants me back. Man, I wish you were gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wish I could help you with that--&quot; Ty said, disgusted by the idea, but before he could catch himself the words were out of his mouth. Reality shifted. <br />
<br />
Andrew placed his hand on Ty's thigh. New/old feelings surged through him. He couldn't muster the strength to push Andrew away, but he still resisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, please stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can tell me, man. I told you. I wish you had more courage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blushed, and shook his head. &quot;I wish I did too, but--&quot; and everything changed. He looked up at Andrew with a new grin, and leaned in and kissed him by surprise. The surprise was momentary, and in seconds they had taken each other's shirts off and were exploring one another's jock bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're so hot. I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too. I've wanted this for so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
They couldn't keep their hands off of one another. They rolled around on the floor, fighting for domination. Ty wanted to get inside of Andrew so bad. &quot;God, I want you so bad.&quot; Ty said seductively, pausing before Andrew's lips. &quot;I wish you'd let me be the dominant one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something changed within Andrew. Suddenly he felt nothing but love and devotion for Ty. He would do everything Ty wanted him to. Ty was bigger, stronger, smarter. In mere moments they were fucking, Andrew nearly frantic to get Ty inside of him.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like hours, they lay on Andrew's bed, exhausted, but in love. They heard the door open.<br />
<br />
Andrew whispered &quot;What are you going to do about your girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Hang on.&quot; Ty said, and finally made a conscious wish.<br />
<br />
There was the sound of two female voices giggling as they snuck past Andrew's door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my sister brought some girl home from the club.&quot; Andrew said. His parents were surprised that both children had turned out gay, but had long since learned to accept it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares?&quot; Ty said, and kissed Andrew on the lips. In moments, they were at it again.</p>
