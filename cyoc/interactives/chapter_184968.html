<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward had not wanted to come to the game in the first place, but he felt he should attend at least one football game during his time in high school. It doesn&#39;t help that it&#39;s humid as hell outside, and the mosquitos are eating his arms and neck up. As his classmate and the team&#39;s wide receiver, James, runs into the end zone and scores Concord High its fifth touchdown, he unenthusiastically joins his fellow students in applause. A few seconds later, the timer buzzes to signal halftime. As the applause dies down and the teams retreat to the locker rooms, he checks his watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eight o&#39;clock...&quot; He thinks to himself, &quot;Should probably leave soon.&quot; The only reason Edward came to this game is that he has to leave early anyway for a party his friends are throwing here in Lincoln. Looking around him, Edward barely recognizes any of his fellow students. In high school, he&#39;s in all advanced courses, which keeps him almost entirely separate from the remainder of the student body. This party he&#39;s attending is only for the children of Concord&#39;s social elite, and he had to wear his clothes for the party to the game due to the time crunch: A crisp white button-down with the sleeves rolled up just below his elbows, a navy waistcoat matched with a dapper tie, matching navy slacks, and a pair of brown leather Oxford shoes. He feels entirely out of place, but also had a lurking sense of superiority over the people around him. Turning to leave, he&#39;s stopped by the game&#39;s announcer tapping on the microphone and beginning to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening Lincoln and Concord High! It is now time for the halftime kick, where one student of either Lincoln or Concord will get a chance to win a $500 Target gift-card!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five-hundred dollars,&quot; Edward thought to himself, &quot;Chump change.&quot; Beginning to move past the student next to him to leave, the announcer continues. &quot;And the lucky student to attempt the field kick from the 30 yard-line is... Edward Fleetwood!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking he misheard, Edward pauses. The students around him begin to whisper, &quot;Who&#39;s that,&quot; &quot;Wait, I think he was in my chemistry class,&quot; and finally &quot;Oh, there he is! That blond guy!&quot; A couple students point at Edward as he stands confused and the vice principal of the school comes beside him. &quot;You can follow me!&quot; The Vice Principal takes his hand and leads him down to the football field.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have to put your name down to be chosen for this?&quot; Edward asks as he steps onto the football field.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir. And your name was on there, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... No?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re already here so give it a try,&quot; the Vice Principal says as she plops Edward down on a metal bench and hands him a pair of white Nike football cleats. &quot;Here, put these on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling the immense pressure of the stadium full of people and the imposing Vice Principal looming over him, he reluctantly unties his Oxfords and sets them off to the side. He quickly slips his dress-sock clad feet into the cleats and stands. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go!&quot; The Vice Principal leads him to the thirty yard-line, where a football player Edward doesn&#39;t recognize is standing with a football, and the Coach is standing next to him with his hands behind his back.<br />
<br />
The announcer&#39;s voice booms over the speakers as Edward reaches the line. &quot;Let&#39;s make some noise for Edward as he attempts to make this 30-yard kick!&quot; The stadium erupts into cheering as the football player kneels and positions the football for the kick. Edward steps back and takes a breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it would be a cool story if I made this,&quot; Edward thinks to himself. Brushing his clammy hands on his slacks, he begins running toward the ball. Planting one cleated foot next to the ball, he transfers all his power into the leg drawn back, and lurches it forward toward the waiting ball. Hitting the ball just right, Edward catches himself as he watches the football propel toward the uprights. The crowd watches with bated breath, and as the ball narrowly clears the crossbar of the goal, the students are the first to erupt into cheers. Standing in shock, Edward is clapped on the back by the Coach and given a high-five by the football player.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me,&quot; the Coach says as he waves to the crowd and turns Edward to walk toward the locker room with the football player in tow. &quot;Congrats to Concord High student, Edward Fleetwood, for winning the $500 Target gift card, generously supplied by your local Target store!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But my shoes are over there!&quot; Edward says to the Coach while pointing back towards the bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about those.&quot; Confused, Edward continues walking with the Coach. Reaching the locker rooms, Edward smells the musk of the sweaty jocks before the door even opens.<br />
<br />
&quot;The card&#39;s in here, it&#39;ll just be a minute.&quot; The Coach swings the door open, and Edward is greeted by the sight of the Concord High football team sitting in a U-shaped formation along the walls of the locker room. They&#39;re a sweaty bunch of guys, with wet hair and glistening muscles. The jocks study the skinny prep as he stands awkwardly waiting for the gift card. The Coach walks to a side room and opens the door, standing in the doorway, he turns his head back to the team and says, &quot;You should all know how this works. We&#39;re doing this one the old-fashioned way. Begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two of the jocks closest to Edward jump from their seats and grab Edward. &quot;What are you doing?! Let go of me!&quot; Edward struggles against the two, but they easily overpower him and force him to sit on the bench. Cocking his head to the side, Edward notices that he&#39;s seated in front of a locker full of football equipment. One of the jocks gets to work roughly loosening the tie, quickly sliding it off. After tossing the tie to the side, he begins unbuttoning Edward&#39;s waistcoat and button-down, while yet another jock is yanking the cleats off. With all the buttons undone, the jock forces the shirt off Edward and throws it in the corner.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the bench shirtless and with his face blushing, Edward begins, &quot;Hey! What do you think you&#39;re doing? My parents are going to know of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping in front of Edward, the football player that held the ball as Edward kicked it starts to talk, &quot;You&#39;re going to be my replacement. My name&#39;s Sam, and I&#39;m the team&#39;s kicker. I&#39;m graduating this year, and I wanted to have a part in choosing my successor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Edward laughs, &quot;I&#39;m graduating this year, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for much longer,&quot; Sam says as he nods to the jocks on either side of Edward as the jock that had been working on his cleats and socks finally yanks Edward&#39;s slacks clean off his legs. Now only in his underwear, Edward sits in embarrassment and confusion at what Sam just said as the jocks continue. A jock reaches into the locker behind Edward and grabs a white tank top and jockstrap from inside. The jock easily throws the tank over Edward and commands the skinny prep to put his arms through. Looking around the room and seeing the ripped jocks looking at him threateningly, he obeys and puts his skinny arms through the tank top. The jock hands him the jockstrap and gestures at his crotch. &quot;Are-are you serious?&quot; Staring at him in silence, Edward gets the message from the jock. He stands up and pulls his underwear down and off. He steps into the jockstrap and pulls the straps up his legs. He positions his soft, 3-inch dick into the pouch and sits back down. &quot;Excellent,&quot; says Sam as another jock pulls a pair of shoulder pads and a jersey out of the locker. The jock deftly throws the crimson jersey over the shoulder pads and adjusts it. Satisfied, he lifts the shoulder pads over Edward, guides the pads past Edward&#39;s head, and places them onto his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lift your arms up,&quot; the jock orders him. Edward obeys, and the jock takes the straps of the pads and tightens them across Edward&#39;s body. Shaking the pads to ensure that they&#39;re tight enough, the jock steps back and the next jock steps up and pulls a pair of padded football pants from the locker. &quot;Stand up,&quot; the jock says. Once again obliging, Edward stands and steps into the pants. He bends down and pulls the pants over his legs, happy to not be in just the jockstrap anymore. Looking at the jocks in the locker room, he copies them by tucking his jersey in and tightening the belt around his waist. &quot;A quick learner, it seems. That&#39;s good,&quot; Sam says as he tosses the football cleats back to Edward. &quot;Put those back on, and these, too.&quot; He quickly tosses a pair of white Nike ankle socks to Edward and walks over to where the Coach is standing. Under the watchful eyes of the rest of the jocks, Edward slips the socks on and then the cleats, making sure to tie the laces tight against his feet. Sitting up from tying his cleats, Edward feels a burning sensation all over his body.<br />
<br />
Turning back toward him and away from the Coach, Sam says, &quot;Looks like it&#39;s beginning. Hold him still.&quot; The two jocks that have been standing beside him sit down and lock arms with Edward, ensuring he doesn&#39;t try to run away. The burning worsens, and Edward feels his shoulder pads get tighter as his chest expands. &quot;What&#39;s happening to meEe?!&quot; On that last word, Edward&#39;s voice jumped up and then bottomed out, giving him a new, deeper voice. Shocked he continues, &quot;What did you do?!&quot; The burning continues as Edward develops a prominent six-pack under his football jersey.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re making you one of us. And younger—welcome back to the beginning of your junior year!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Why- AGH!&quot; Edward screams out in pain as his legs crack and grow. His cleats get further from his body as his legs grow to give him a height of 6&#39;2. His calves burn furiously and morph into the diamond shape that so many of his fellow jocks have. His thighs muscle up to back up the power of his kick. Although not important for his role as a kicker, his arms are next: His biceps grow tremendously, and the veins bulge against his tan skin. His deltoids and forearms follow suit, giving him the trademark jock look. Lastly, his dick begins to dully throb as it lengthens, settling at a strong eight-inches. His balls churn as his seed is turned into jock seed, and he feels the instant need to jerk off. As he rubs a burly hand over his dick&#39;s tip through the pants, the burning finally subsides, and Edward slumps down on the bench, exhausted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost done,&quot; Sam says as he takes a helmet and mouthguard from Coach. &quot;You&#39;re a jock to anyone just looking at you, but you&#39;re not a jock in that mind of your&#39;s, are you?&quot; Sam was right. Edward had no idea how to play football, how to actually make a field goal without pure luck, or even how to act like a jock. He simply shook his head as his muscular chest went up and down with shaky breaths. &quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Sam says as he sets the mouthguard and helmet down on the ground. &quot;We&#39;ll fix that.&quot; He undoes the belt of his football pants and pulls his erect 7-incher out from his precum-stained jockstrap. Picking the crimson helmet back up, he begins stroking his dick and moaning loudly. Within a few seconds, he cums into the helmet and hands it off to the jock next to him who had already whipped his dick out. The helmet gets passed around the football team, with each jock unloading his jock seed into it. Eventually, the helmet is passed back to Sam—full of the team&#39;s ejaculate. The padding in the helmet had absorbed a substantial amount, but most of it laid in a pool in the helmet. Taking the mouthguard, Sam puts it in his mouth. Looking at Edward as he takes it out covered in his spit, he attaches it to the face cage of the helmet and steps in front of Edward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the team, Edward.&quot; He flips the helmet right-way up and pushes it onto Edward&#39;s head. Edward immediately feels the lukewarm cum start to pour out over his head, but before he can make any sound, Sam forces the crimson, spit-soaked mouthguard into Edward&#39;s mouth. Swallowing the excess spit, Edward feels his Adam&#39;s apple push stronger against his throat and his mind dulling. His preppy personality is soon replaced by that of a jock, allowing him to fit in with his new friends, the football team. His memories begin to change, too, all memory of his senior year is erased as he reverts back to a junior. Instead of being pampered all his life, his father, who came from nothing, wanted him to know the struggle of real work. He made Edward spend his summers growing up doing manual labor with contractors he hired for his company&#39;s projects. This change altered Edward&#39;s personality, making him much more down-to-earth and eradicating his superiority complex. Although his family is rich, Edward never got involved with the teenagers of the ultra-rich, instead making friends with those he played football and basketball with in high school starting his freshman year. Soaked with cum, his hair begins to grow, ending up in a long flow that Edward would push back. As Edward finishes his transformation, the memories of everyone else are changed to match the new Edward. Seeing that the transformation is done, the Coach walks over to Edward and lifts the helmet off his head. He takes a rag and dries the helmet and mouthguard off, then places them back in his gym bag. He takes a wet towel and wipes a dazed Edward&#39;s face and hair free of cum, then returns to the side room as the football team awakens from their memory changes.<br />
<br />
Back-up kicker Edward sits on the bench chatting with Sam as he runs his hands through his sweat-soaked hair and ties it up in a loose man-bun. He joins his teammates in standing as Coach clears his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You men ready to finish this game strong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; Edward joins the team with his new jock voice. &quot;And you, Edward,&quot; Coach says while looking at the new jock, &quot;Are gonna start this half.&quot; Sam excitedly claps his hand on Edward&#39;s shoulder pads. &quot;Thank you, Coach,&quot; Edward says as he smiles with a signature jock smirk. Reaching behind him with his muscular arm, he grabs the helmet resting in the locker and pulls it on his head. The other jocks join in and make their way to the second half.</p>
