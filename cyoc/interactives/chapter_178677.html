<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke got into the office fifteen minute late. Mr. Wilkins, his boss, well his boss&#39; boss gave him a look from the doorway of his office, then looked at the clock. He expected something of a glare, but the boss just grinned and slipped back inside his corner office. Weird. He went to his cubicle and stopped. Something seemed off. Then he spotted his name plate, it didn&#39;t read Luke Miller anymore, but Luke Marino. He knew the bracelet tweaked perceptions and memories, and adjusted his clothes, why should he be surprised other things changed.<br />
<br />
As he settled down at his desk he pulled out his wallet. All his cards had his new name, and his driver&#39;s license even had a photo of the current him with new height and weight. Weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone got laid last night.&quot; Came a teasing female voice though in a light whisper. He looked up to see Valerie standing in the entrance to his cubicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Luke straightened his tie and slicked back his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your clothes are rumpled and you&#39;re wearing the same tie as yesterday. Same clothes, too. You never wear the same tie two days in a row.&quot; Valerie knew him way too well. &quot;Spill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I met a guy at the gym. We hit it off.&quot; Luke admitted as he tried not to blush thinking about it, or to get hard again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a pic?&quot; Luke rolled his eyes at her request.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but it&#39;s.. he&#39;s..&quot; Luke faltered but she waved for him to show her anyway, so he pulled up the nude on his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof. Makes me wish I was into guys. Dennis will be heartbroken.&quot; She giggled as she handed the phone back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dennis?&quot; Luke asked, definitely sounding unsure.<br />
<br />
&quot;How have you not noticed he&#39;s got a total crush on you?&quot; Valerie laughed a little but Luke just wondered. He guessed he could shift sexuality as a physical trait then, at least to some degree. Or Dennis was bi to start with and his new body gave him different wants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marino!&quot; Came a call from the direction of the Wilkins&#39; office, it took a moment and a smack on the shoulder from Valerie to remind him that was him. He popped up over the wall of the computer and saw his boss beckoning him towards the office. Maybe we was going to get an ass chewing for being late. He sighed and quickly made his way tot he office, a whispered wish for luck from Valerie as he headed in there.<br />
<br />
He walked into the office, looking at his boss who was leaning against the front of his desk, arms crossed over his chest. &quot;Take a seat.&quot; He motioned not to one of the chairs in front of his desk but to the couch. As Luke did his boss closed and locked the office door, then flicked shut the blinds that covered the window that gave him a view into the office proper. &quot;How long have you been with us now, Marino?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six months.&quot; Luke asked, feeling a little trepidation. His boss was an intimidating man, more so when Luke had been in his old body, scrawnier, but even now Mr. Wilkins acted like he was in full control. It didn&#39;t help that he had a definite DILF air about him. In his late fifties, he had salt and pepper hair, neatly trimmed beard, and a body that was muscular, but softened somewhat by age and a love of good food. His pecs stuck out as far as his gut though, making him appear tough rather than soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six months, and today was the only day you&#39;ve been late.&quot; Wilkins leaned back against his desk again, watching Luke. &quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t really care, as long as you get your work done and keep me happy, I understand things happen.&quot; He knew he had paled at first, but then sighed in relief. &quot;I just like to touch base with everyone once they&#39;ve been here a while, to see what their plans are, get a feel for them. Do you like working here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Luke answered feeling a bit more relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Travis speaks highly of you.&quot; Travis was the first name of Luke&#39;s actual boss, who worked directly for Wilkins. &quot;Says you have drive. Do you? Are you intending to stay with us? Move up the company ladder?&quot; Luke nodded and Wilkins continued. &quot;I like to take promising candidates under my wing. Have them work for a while as my executive assistants. Travis did this for a year before taking his current job, and my last one just got promoted to the New York office. I find myself in need of a new one, but I need someone who will follow orders, but can think for themselves. Travis thinks you have the qualities I&#39;m looking for. Position comes with a twenty thousand dollar raise, the desk right outside my office, and ten extra days of vacation. You just have to do as I ask, are you willing to do so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d, uh, like to think so, sir.&quot; Luke was watching Wilkins carefully, picking his words carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip.&quot; Wilkins said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said strip. Take off your clothes.&quot; Luke was a little stunned, he knew this was only partially to do with his work ethic now. Which he knew was good, but obviously Wilkins had certain tastes. Idly, he touched the bracelet before standing, he was curious about where this was going. So he did as asked and began to unbutton his shirt as he stepped out of his shoes. He shrugged out of his shirt and under shirt, he could feel those steely gray eyes on him.<br />
<br />
Wilkins simply watched, arms over his chest, impassive. Next, Luke&#39;s pants came off and he set those aside on the couch with the rest of his clothes. &quot;Boxers, too.&quot; Wilkins said, and Luke nodded his assent, adding those to the pile as he stood in front of the man, naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Travis was right.&quot; Wilkins began to unbutton his own shirt, he wore no undershirt, instead exposing meaty pecs and a solid gut covered in curly hair salt and peppered gray and black like his beard. &quot;I expect my assistants to help me with everything. My wife, bless her heart, I love her, but she also knows my predilections. She allows this as long as I don&#39;t keep a lover for more than a year or so, as long as I&#39;m discreet, and I&#39;ve found the business world full of hot young studs willing to do anything to move up. I like it even more when they enjoy it.&quot; Wilkins said with a smile directed downwards between Luke&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s cock was betraying him. Wilkins was quite handsome, even if he was old enough to be his father. Wilkins opened the front of his pants, his own half-engorged cock spilling out. Luke had him on length, easy, but the older man had one of the thickest cocks he&#39;d seen, with a foreskin riding halfway up the partially exposed glans, the tip red and glistening. Luke had never seen a cock uncut before, not in the flesh. He wondered how it felt. &quot;Show me what you can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke gulped softly, then walked over and knelt in front of his boss. It had been a while since he gave a blow job, even if he had gotten one only that morning. He opened his mouth and took the cock between his lips. The thickness of it once fully erect had his jaw open all the way. He wanted his cock to be this thick. So while he sucked off his boss, he took advantage of the situation. One hand held the cock for him while the other went down to his own member. His hand wrapped around his shaft, he could feel it swelling, pushing his fingers apart as his cock swelled to match Wilkins&#39; girth with the length he swiped from Dennis. His tongue explored around the shaft, teasing the spots he could remember Gio hitting this morning. Though the foreskin gave his tongue something else to explore. He copied that too, feeling skin growing up the end of his shaft, though hard as he was it didn&#39;t cover his head at the moment, still, it felt wonderful as he stroked his cock, the skin sliding back and forth.<br />
<br />
Wilkins put his hand on Luke&#39;s head, guiding him as he began to thrust in and out of Luke&#39;s mouth, salty pre dribbled across his tongue. Wilkins fucked his mouth for what felt like almost ten minutes. Luke came, spilling his own seed from his even more enhanced cock across the office carpet, but Wilkins was still going. He was actually worried he might be doing something wrong and then he felt the cock pulse in his mouth, a flood of warm, salty seed sliding down his throat almost making him cough, but he would have had to fight Wilkins&#39; grip to pull his head off his superior&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Once the stream ended, he was allowed to back off, gasping softly. He stood slowly, his legs a bit weak, then he felt Wilkins&#39; mouth on his, tasting his own seed in Luke&#39;s mouth. &quot;That was very good. I&#39;ll want to try that ass of yours someday, but I think that was a successful interview.&quot; He reached down and fondled Luke&#39;s balls, giving the now even larger cock a single flop. &quot;I heard the rumor you were packing, it doesn&#39;t do you credit.&quot; Wilkins pulled up his pants as if it was the most natural thing in the world, pulling some wipes out of his desk and pushing them towards Luke. &quot;You might want to clean yourself up, and your spill.&quot; He looked down at the carpet with a smile. &quot;Nice to know this old man can still make young men bust a nut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke cleaned up his mouth, and his cum from the carpet as Wilkins sat in his chair, buttoning up his shirt. Once the mess was taken care off, Luke started dressing, Wilkins didn&#39;t stop him. He took one wondering glance at his impressive tool before tucking it away. He had a passing thought of stuffing Gio full with the thing this weekend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have the HR paperwork sent to your email. Get it back by end of business today and get your projects passed on to Dennis. You start Monday.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Luke nodded as he tucked his shirt into his pants and straightened his tie. He gave his hair a check with his hand to make sure it was in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;And buy yourself some thongs.&quot; Wilkins looked at Luke&#39;s crotch. &quot;Ones with very large pouches. Its the only underwear I want to see you in from now on.&quot; What had he gotten himself into. Wilkins dismissed him with a wave to the door and he returned to his desk, most of the eyes in the office following him. He felt like they knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that about? You were in there a while.&quot; Valerie asked as he took his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interview. He needs a new assistant. I think it went well.&quot; It was all he could tell his friend as he sat there, trying to collect his thoughts.</p>
