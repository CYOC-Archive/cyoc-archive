<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin headed off to his second hour class, weightlifing. He was sure he'd have a good time showing off. At first he lifted his normal weight amounts, but he slowly increased the number of weights, and wished himself able to wish any amount of weight he wanted, as many reps as he wanted. He walked over to Tom, the strongest kid in the class, and regional weighlifting champion, and said, &quot;Hey Tom, I bet I can lift more than you can.&quot; Tom eyed his competition and said, &quot;Wanna put some money on that?&quot; Dustin was by no means small, but Tom was sure he would win. Dustin said, &quot;Sure, you win, I'll give you 50 bucks.&quot; Tom nodded, bets on weightlifting were usually not that high, &quot;And if you win?&quot; Dustin smirked, &quot;Oh nothing, just respect.&quot; Tom laughed a bit as he thought it was a win-win situation. Dustin said, &quot;You go first, lift your max.&quot; Tom put 200 pounds on a bar-bell and layed down, he did two reps, and racked the bar, sweating a little. Dustin added two 25 pound weights to the bar and layed down, doing 20 reps before putting the bar back on the rack. He had barely broken a sweat. Tom looked shocked, and thought that there must be some kind of mistake, he said, &quot;Let me see that, and he tried to lift the bar. He managed to do one rep before his strength gave out, and his spotter helped him rack it. He was sweating profusely. Tom was a bit freaked out, but insisted that Dustin had cheated somehow. Dustin would have been mad, but the fact was, he had cheated... But he was still gonna get some payback. When the class went to the showers and started to undress. He wished for Tom's dick to shrink to that of a 10 year olds. Dustin finally got his underwear off and went into the shower, getting alot of jealous looks at his own monster that Ty had given him the other day. When Tom finally made it in, he still hadnt noticed, a bunch of people around him giggled, and he said, &quot;What's so funny?&quot; A kid laughingly said, &quot;Well, for a champion weight-lifter, you arent very well endowed where it counts.&quot; Tom glared at him, but couldnt help but look down. He noticed that his once above-average unit, was now only about the size of a baby carrot. He glared around and noticed that Dustin was the only one not suprised. He said, &quot;You did this to me, somehow, didnt you?&quot; Dustin smiled at him and whispered in his ear, &quot;Yeah, and remember that, cause I could do much worse.&quot; Tom gritted his teeth and said, &quot;Yeah right, you are just taking credit for my late blooming, unable to accept what Dustin said.&quot; Dustin decided to show him what he meant. He wished for everyone but him and Tom to hurry up and finish. As the last of the other kids walked out, Dustin said to him, &quot;Dont believe me? Try this.&quot; Dustin mentally wished for a pair of female breasts to appear on Tom and grow one cup size every three seconds until Tom says, &quot;Dustin is god.&quot; Tom suddenly felt a pressure and saw two small cones forming on his chest, he backed up into the corner of the shower and said, &quot;NO! IT CANT BE!&quot; Dustin laughed and waited till they were about F cups, while Tom was crying in the corner he said, &quot;They will keep growing till you say Dustin is god.&quot; Tom shook his head, and said, &quot;NO! I'LL NEVER SAY THAT, THIS IS JUST A DREAM.&quot; They continued growing, passing over porn-star levels and becoming so huge that Tom couldn't stand up anymore, he slid down the wall and let them rest on him as he layed down, but soon the pressure made it hard for him to breath. Dustin wished for them to start squirting milk, and thick white fluid began to flow down Tom's chest and into the floor drain. Tom finally gave up as he found the weight made him unable to move, and said, &quot;DUSTIN IS GOD! PLEASE HELP ME!&quot; Dustin smirked and said, &quot;Remember that.&quot; Then he wished for the breasts to go down to B-Cups and stop squirting milk. Tom thought they were going away, as his gigantic tits rapidly diminished, but they slowed down a bit early, and were still there when they stopped shrinking. He looked at Dustin and said, &quot;What? You can't leave me like this!&quot; Dustin smiled and replied, &quot;I could put you back how you were a second ago?&quot; Tom shook his head and started to cry. Dustin continued, &quot;You can cover these up if you are careful, dont worry, they will go away in a week, but if you tell anyone how you got them, they will grow back to the huge size they just were, and stay there.&quot; Dustin left the showers and got dressed. Tom waited till everyone was gone and then ran out and put on a t-shirt and a baggy sweater to cover them up. Meanwhile, in Ty's Algebra class, Ty had spent the whole hour staring at Mrs. Jones, the teacher, she was the prettiest teacher in the school, but always wore a business suit that hid all her features, so he wished her clothes to be invisible to him, revealing a very shapely body that made him pretty horny. She didnt seem to notice him looking at her the way he was, but when class ended, she asked him to stay after class. Everyone filed out except him, and she walked up to him and said, &quot;Ty, I noticed the way you were looking at me, but I assure you, none of your fantasies will happen if I have anything to say about it, so dont let them interfere with your schoolwork.&quot; Ty wished for her to never think anything he did around her was strange or out of the norm, so when she finished her speech, he kissed her, and copped a quick feel on her breast. She continued as if nothing had happened, &quot;Now, get to third hour.&quot; Ty headed off to his Biology class.</p>
