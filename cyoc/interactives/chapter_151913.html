<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate came to the decision to select the deer hunt. He liked the idea of forming his own pack, but he would have to be careful to select people who would want to be werewolves and enjoy it, but also not turn into homicidal monsters. They needed to keep a low profile if they didn&#39;t want to be locked away in government facility for the rest of their natural born lives. He also had a genuine concern that if he bit anyone else they would be doomed to the same painful transformation night after night so he needed to get rid of that. But, maybe he could even find one that would be his werewolf boyfriend. That thought really excited him.   <br />
<br />
The idea of hunting a human intrigued him and it never said anything about it having to be an innocent person. While the idea of becoming a vigilante werewolf of sorts intrigued him, he was also hesitant to open that door at least not until he had a better handle on his new powers. So, for the time being it was going to have to be the deer hunt again for the next night, and then the three nights of the next full moon for a while after that. He let out a sigh and figured he&#39;d manage. <br />
<br />
He tossed the torn clothes on his bedroom floor and went across the hall to the bathroom. He started the shower and waited for it to get warm. As he waited, he checked himself out in the mirror and was shocked at the sight of himself. His hair was dirty and matted. He had dried blood smeared around his mouth. He was filthy head to toe, but beneath that he noticed a surprising amount of muscle definition where there that not been any the night before. His pecs and abs were clearly defined and he had some fantastic biceps too. He began to flex in front of the mirror. He decided his new found lycanthropy definitely agreed with him, even if the actual change was excruciating. <br />
<br />
The shower felt magnificent as he washed away all the dirt and grime. He stepped out feeling amazing. As he dried off, he began strategizing for that night. It was the waning full moon and he was sure he would transform again. He remembered an old backpack in the closet and pulled it out. He decided he&#39;d bring that with and stash his clothes and sneakers in there to keep them safe and have them ready the following morning. His family wouldn&#39;t get home until the next day, Sunday, so he still had another day to work out how he was going to live going forward with his newfound werewolfdom. <br />
<br />
He suddenly remembered that his father had installed security cameras by all the doors of the house. He quickly got dressed and ran downstairs to the office and logged into the family computer. His father had showed him how the system worked so he had no problem pulling up the feed from the previous night. He watched with excitement as the video played out. His transformation played out in front of him as he watched his usual, chubby self morph into a muscular, hairy beast. Unfortunately there wasn&#39;t any sound, but Nate didn&#39;t need any. Any normal person would be horrified but all he could feel was excitement. He couldn&#39;t wait to transform again. He saved the file to a jump drive and then deleted it from the computer.<br />
<br />
He placed the jump drive in his sock drawer, safely hidden under several layers of socks, sure to remain undisturbed. He then began to pace the house, waiting for nightfall and his inevitable transition into a beast of the night. <br />
<br />
Night arrived soon enough and Nate slung the bookbag over his shoulder as he made his way into the woods again. He followed his prints in the snow back to his cave. His hideout. His den. He sat down on a large tree log just outside the cave, setting his bag at the entrance as he watched the sun go down. He was a good half mile from the house, so he could probably scream and howl all he wanted and no one would hear. <br />
<br />
It was a couple hours after night fall that the transformation started. He felt the familiar pains in his gut and began pulling off his clothes. He folded them quickly and stuck them in the bag, zipping it shut. He checked the clock on his phone, 9:30pm. He then slipped that into the bag pocket as well. He pulled off his shoes and tossed them in the cave along with the bag. He took a deep breath and stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;m ready,&quot; he whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
He began to feel itchy all over as his fur began to grow in. The familiar pains of his claws growing in, ripping out his thin fingernails in the process soon followed. It hurt, but Nate derived an odd sense of joy from it. He relented to the change this time and it progressed much faster. His ears grew to points, his teeth to sharp fangs. His feet grew and stretched to digitigrade paws and his face grew out into a lupine snout. He let out a loud howl. The wolf was back and Nate couldn&#39;t be more thrilled. He let his wolf instincts overcome him and took over as the primal urges drove him into the woods. He gave over to his animal side willingly as he darted between the trees, exhilarated by the power he felt within himself as the wolf. He was loving every minute of it as he slowed, creeping through the forest, taking in the scents of the forest. <br />
<br />
The wolf followed the scent as his silently made his way through the forest and it was only a matter of time before he came across the deer, bedded down for the night. The deer barely had time to react before Nate had pounced on it and once again made a quick kill and began his feast. There was a primal freedom to this that excited him. All sense of social decorum or humanity gone, just the pure beast out in the front. After finishing, the wolf made his way back to his den. <br />
<br />
He awoke to the sounds of the forest as he slowly sat up. He reached over to his bookbag and pulled out his phone. He was shocked to see the time: 10:15am. He quickly pulled on his clothes and darted out of the cave, running home the whole way. His mind was racing. He hadn&#39;t meant to sleep so late. He darted across the lawn to the back patio. He silently prayed his parents weren&#39;t home yet as he opened the patio door and slipped inside, feeling a distinct feeling of deja vu as he did. He sighed a sense of relief that he only had to deal with this three nights out of the year.</p>
