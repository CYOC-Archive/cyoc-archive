<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After school that day, Colton was walking down the hall towards the front entrance of the school. As the students had been dismissed, there was throngs of people in the halls. Everyone was opening and closing their lockers, grabbing what they needed for homework and leaving what they could behind. <br />
<br />
Most people parted to the sides of the hall for Colton. Not only due to his size, but his reputation as well. He was known to push the smaller boys to the side, and roughly at that. The girls usually swooned or snapped their eyes back as they passed to catch sight of his gloriously taut ass. <br />
<br />
Today was no different, Colton believed, until he rounded a corner and nearly collided with a much smaller person. Looking down at the frightened form, Colton recognized the red hair, glasses, and green eyes from earlier. It was the boy that his team mates had roughed up, playfully. Colton flashed him a deadly look, causing the smaller boy to flinch, and spin on his heel.<br />
<br />
The nerd dashed into a door that was still swinging shut from the last person to exit it. Colton was of a mind to leave it, wanting to get behind the wheel of his car and take off for whatever fun he could make on a Friday night. Instead, something about chasing the frightened nerd seemed like a good idea, like it would be great fun.<br />
<br />
Colton pushes the door open, not aware that the stick in his pocket was warming up, thrumming with energy. <br />
<br />
Inside, the nerdy boy was backed up against a window. It was a first floor classroom, but the windows faced towards the woods bordering the school. No one was outside on that part of the school grounds. Colton let the door shut, before he drew the shade on the doors small window.<br />
<br />
“Well, hello there!” Colton laugher. His southern drawl the vocal equivalent of a fine caramel. Soft, sweet and luxurious, he was able to charm a girls pants off with his decadent bass. “Why are you running, little man?”<br />
<br />
“Please... leave me alone!” The kid yelped. “I’ll scream!”<br />
<br />
“Scream about what? I’m not doing anything. We are just talking, my guy.” Colton soothed.<br />
<br />
As he talked the boy into a state of docility, he stepped closer and closer, yet slow enough to not startle his prey. Finally, he was inches in front of the smaller boy.<br />
<br />
“Well, well, well, what do we have here?” Colton whispered, a venomous threatening question. He was leaning over the boy, when the small hands of the nerd pushed against his abdomen. <br />
<br />
In a sudden and defensive move, Colton grabbed the stick from inside his pocket. The nerd looked terrified, until his eyes fell on the stick. It could have been something Colton hit him with, but it was a delicate instrument, thin and frail enough that a strike like that might snap it in two.<br />
<br />
Instead, the smaller boy fell into an awed state, transfixed by the strange stick being held by the all-American football boy before him. Colton, similarly, felt his predatory mood melt away into a sudden understanding. This stick was meant to be held by two people...<br />
<br />
Without a word, Colton held one end of the stick with his right hand. The strange guard wrapped around his wrist, and his fingers traced the coursing river engraving. As he looked at his large hand grasp the stick, he noticed that he held the stick in a gesture for the freshman to also take hold.<br />
<br />
The other boy mirrored Colton, grabbing hold of the opposite handle. His fingers traced the river, and the guard wrapped his smaller, bonier  wrist. Then, with green eyes wide, he looked into Coltons own blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Once their eyes locked, the world around them became a blur. A great dizziness overtook them both, and only by some mystical means did the two not drop to the floor. It was as if the world around them was spinning.<br />
<br />
As the blurring ended, Colton was feeling ready to heave. He pulled on the stick, wanting to take it back from the young kid, when a popping sound erupted. Staring at the stick, the two ends had come apart! In anger, Colton looked across to shove the nerd for breaking his stick. What he noticed though, gave him great pause.<br />
<br />
Looming over him, quite suddenly, was an impossible sight. All 6 feet 2 inches of “American grown good ol boy”, Coltons own body stood as stiff as a tower. He was utterly perplexed, this was impossible.<br />
<br />
As the impostor took stock of his own situation, Colton had an even more drastic realization. He cast his eyes down. Hoodie, tshirt, and basic jeans... doc martens and mismatched socks...? This was not his wardrobe. And from the dainty hands, and the nails that looked chewed on, this wasn’t his body.<br />
<br />
Frantic, Colton spun around to the window. It was hard to see with the sunlight falling the way it did, but he could see just well enough. The face was not his face, though the surprised and dread was all his.<br />
<br />
He turned back to the doppelgänger with anxiety. Sure enough, Coltons former body was grinning evilly down at him.</p>
