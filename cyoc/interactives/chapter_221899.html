<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasper really thought about leaving and escaping from that Carnelian dragon. However, he was lost there. Where would he go? How could he live as a dragon? He was new at this! He needed help and he couldn&#39;t be picky about it! But... But the help that Carnelian could offer involved him becoming his mate! Him, a royal prince, to end up as a female dragon! If only he could be a male dragon! A male! But no, Anya had taken her sweet revenge in making him a girl! How vile! How degrading! His macho mind reeled at the mere thought. And to make things worse, his mind was starting to think like a dragon girl! If he didn&#39;t do something soon, he would lose himself completely and become a dragon breeder just good for laying eggs! His days as a great prince and future ruler of a kingdom would be gone for good! He&#39;d have the hots for a male dragon! Ugh! But if he left, then the other dragon might get angry and hurt him to boot. Yet maybe telling the truth was simpler. And who knew? This red dragon might help him with magic or something. He could even help him get revenge on Anya. A revenge he planned on making very, very slow and painful. Moreover, he had just been mounted by a dragon! How could he face himself and other people in his kingdom? He&#39;d be the laughingstock of the entire land! For the entirety of his life! His reign was over before it could even begin! Jasper felt dirty and completely humiliated. He had been seized and mounted like a female! Him! It wasn&#39;t supposed to happen! HE was the one to have torrid intercourse with females! Human females! What if he was now pregnant? If he was alone in being a dragon, it would be already difficult. With eggs and babies, it would be nigh impossible. Because of Anya, and because of this Carnelian, he was stuck for the moment. This stupid dragon who had mounted him without his consent! Naturally, it did not cross Jasper&#39;s mind that he had done just as vile things as a prince. Such self-criticism was beyond him and would become so permanently very soon. He eyed Carnelian with a dark look. Yet as he lingered on the red dragon&#39;s body, Jasper couldn&#39;t help but notice how strong he was. How red and shiny his scales were. How sharp his teeth were. His handsomeness escaped by waves from him. And his look. So caring and tender... He would make a very responsible and attentive mate and sire. His words had proven as much. His hoard was sure to be large. And he would spoil her. He found her so, so beautiful... And she&#39;d make him proud, making sure she was a good mother and be decked in finery for the pleasure of his eyes. His passion had been quite...arousing. Jasper thought about how his womb had clenched around his penis, desperately seeking his pleasure, its own and above all the strong gametes that promised the strongest and cutest babies. Yes, Rose Quartz was a jewel in the eyes of Carnelian and she&#39;d make him little gems to adore in turn. They&#39;d all cuddle and snuggle and bathe and play and it would be so fluffy...<br />
Jasper shook himself. No! Why was he thinking those stupid girly thoughts!?!? He was going to become a silly female dragon for good, with absolutely no brains. <br />
&quot;Is something the matter, my dear?&quot; said Carnelian with a most charming smile.<br />
Jasper had to refrain from kissing the handsome dragon right here and there. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a dragon! I&#39;m a human guy! I was transformed by accident! And I&#39;m losing my mind! I&#39;m starting to think like a dragon who loves you! Please help me!&quot;<br />
Carnelian was taken aback. This was not what he had suspected. He had mated with a former human male! Revolting! Yet... Transformation or no, the result was rather excellent. Downright enchanting, even. And as a male dragon, females were rare to come by. Should he be picky? No, of course. Human male or not, this was a beautiful female he wanted to have near him. Besides... Did she, or he, say he was started to think like a female dragon increasingly? That would explain what she had said before. Her personality was slowly altering itself, with new desires, tastes and memories. So soon, he&#39;d have the real deal. In fact, he could even mould her even more into the perfect mate she already looked like. He&#39;d make her girly and silly. That would be excellent! A bit of hypnosis might help too. So feigning concern, he asked Rose Quartz what had occurred and she told her about being a prince and about a magical amulet. Interesting. If he could find that Anya, Carnelian thought, well, he could get more gorgeous females. Who cared if they were humans previously? He could get them tailor-made, probably! A dream come true! So he pretended to have magic in his cave to return Jasper to his former appearance, to which the pink dragon looked happy and relieved. A cave too small to raise hatchlings, but big enough to keep his darling Rose Quartz for a while. Instead of magic, the pink dragon would get a chain and plenty of time to see her mind change for good. And good lessons and mesmerizing stares and words from Carnelian, of course. And once everything with his enchanting Rose Quartz settled, he would look for this Anya human who possessed interesting magic.</p>
