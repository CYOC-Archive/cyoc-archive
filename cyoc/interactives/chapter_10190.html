<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire was a gorgeous twenty two year old business tycoon. She ran an entire global corporation, with only a few aids for consulting purposes. Her orders filtered down and shaped an entire economy, larger than some countries! She was an extremely powerful and competent woman, who had been trained since an early age to run her empire with a strong hand.<br />
<br />
She was strikingly beautiful, exquisitely elegant and possessed an incredible intellect. Her hair was dyed a dark red, like a good wine. She had green eyes with flecks of gold and a perfect complexion. Standing 5’10 she was often as tall, if not taller than her consultants, clients or rivals. Her figure was lean and toned, but she had the body of a stripper. Her legs were long and supple, her ass like a firm peach and her breasts a succulent 36D. With looks came an analytical mind and an IQ of over 140. Unfortunately, at the same time as being all this, she was also a real bitch.<br />
<br />
So it was that when she found school children had been using her private changing room at the leisure centre she owned, Claire reacted in a decisive way. She had all of them thrown out and banned from ever entering again. ‘I do not want stupid little teenagers messing up my room! They can go elsewhere and enjoy the public facilities! They have not earned the right to change in luxury! When they have made anywhere near as much money as I, and been successful, they can experience such things.’ That was how she put it. A few of the girls were thrown out wearing only their sports gear and their uniforms had been left in the changing room. Claire had threatened them with charges of trespassing if they didn’t leave immediately. Now the area was entirely empty. Save for a shadowy presence.<br />
<br />
Claire, now sure everyone was gone and the room was private once more, started to take her kit off. She threw her expensive trainers on the floor and slipped out of her socks, then pulled her jogging trousers down to reveal her shapely legs. With a swift tug, her sweater was off and then she undid her bra and released her large and large nippled breasts. She slipped her silk panties off and threw them on the pile of clothes, then stepped into her private shower. As she soaped her perfect body in the shower, the shadowy presence got to work. <br />
<br />
Within a second, her expensive sporting gear was vaporized. The shadowy presence hovered above the only clothes left in the room, a school uniform worn by one of the evicted girls. It was a traditional English uniform of a pleated grey skirt, white blouse and a blue sweater. A red and blue striped tie sat beside the crumpled uniform, with a pair of ankle socks and black school shoes. The shadowy presence sensed out the owner of the uniform as the new basis for Claire. He found the girl was sixteen years old, 5’2 and of a below average IQ. She rated somewhere around ninety, making her the slowest in the class. Ideal. With a blast of power, the shadowy presence endowed the clothes with the ability to warp human forms and minds…then it was gone, back to the medallion.<br />
<br />
Claire opened the shower door and swept her slightly wet hair away from her face. She looked around and saw her clothes were missing! Her expensive gear, stolen! Probably by one of the stupid little teenage girls who had been here before. She saw the uniform the next moment and thought, perhaps, there was a chance her expensive gear had been jumbled up with it. She walked over and lifted the blue sweater. Immediately, she felt different. Her centre of gravity and perspective shifted. She shrank down six inches in height, yet her figure adapted to this. She was shorter, but just as lean and her breasts were the same size, though on her shorter frame they appeared even larger, if anything. All of a sudden, just as she was grasping her height reduction…her mind quivered. At first, it was just a few memories going missing. Business meetings were forgotten and sales figures washed away. Then things got more serious. Her great knowledge fell away; literature, art and classical music…gone. Her fluent French, German and Spanish was replaced with the odd word, hard to understand. Maths and English became something she had trouble explaining. Her complex mind became vastly less so. She lost years worth of experiences and learning…and her IQ dropped like a stone from the sky.<br />
<br />
Claire couldn’t believe it. She couldn’t fathom what had happened, at all. She remembered being taller, smarter and older. She remembered also that she was naked and quickly grabbed the uniform. She couldn’t stay here! Nobody would believe it was her now. She was way shorter and couldn’t even spell the name of her old company, let alone claim to run it. What could she do?<br />
<br />
After a few moments, she decided to get dressed in the uniform she was holding. If she got outside, she wouldn’t be at such risk. Claire frantically rifled through the pile she held and found no underwear. Obviously, the girl had worn her bra and panties for sports…which meant Claire had none. Still, a uniform was better than nothing. She pulled on the skirt, then her little ankle socks and shoes. She put the blouse on, buttoned it up and found that her chest was very prominent. Her nipples were clearly visible through the fabric. She did her tie up then and put her sweater on. Searching her memories of the girls who left, she adjusted her tie in the cool way and rolled her sleeves up. She looked like a busty sixteen year old school girl now. Oh, great!</p>
