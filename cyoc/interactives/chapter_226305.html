<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-----------------------<br />
Jeff groggily got up the next morning, moaning as he felt something in between his pecs. His eyes fluttered opened and his gaze was met with two mountains that jut out of his chest and a ridiculously thick one-eyed snake peeked his head just over the crest.<br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot; Jeff moaned, his hands wrapping around his shaft, his arms heavy and bloated with muscle.<br />
&quot;What have I done?&quot; the teen wondered as he began to pleasure his morning wood. Jeff gasped as he felt something strange, it wasn&#39;t just his shaft that was sensitive... The 17 year old could feel his nipples brushing up against the fabric of his shirt, sending a tingle down his spine.<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Jeff called out, &quot;Dad!&quot; The teen was almost breathless with arousal and surprise. It took a moment, but eventually the man answered his call.<br />
&quot;Yes, Jeffery?&quot; Derek said, his hairy, burly physique filling the door frame. The huge man&#39;s eyes go wide as he looks at his son, his own son, who was bigger than him! Derek had to lean over a little just to look into his son&#39;s eyes. &quot;Whoa there, big guy. How can I help?&quot;<br />
&quot;Dad, it&#39;s too sensitive,&quot; Jeff moaned. &quot;What do I do?&quot;<br />
Derek chuckled, &quot;You&#39;ve gotten pretty far along, my boy.&quot; He reached over and placed his hand on the thick pillar of man meat. The huge man groaned, feeling the heat of his son&#39;s cock through his hand.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good you&#39;re asking for help, son. You&#39;re growing and your body&#39;s changing. Just like any teenager, you&#39;ll need to learn how to take care of yourself, so you don&#39;t get overwhelmed.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, I just need to keep jerking it?&quot; Jeff asked. His dad&#39;s hand felt good on his cock, but the sensitivity was overpowering.<br />
&quot;Just like that, son,&quot; Derek grunted, his eyes glazing over. &quot;I remember when I was your age, I was about as big as you. Elias too. We had to take turns helping each other out.&quot;<br />
Jeff gasped, his body wracked with pleasure as he watched his father stroke his cock. &quot;Dad, I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, son,&quot; Derek said, his voice barely more than a growl. &quot;You&#39;re growing. You&#39;ve got a lot of seed in you. Let it all out.&quot;<br />
Jeff gasped as his father stroked his cock faster. The huge teen moaned and gasped, his body wracked with pleasure. With a grunt, Jeff came, his cock erupting like a volcano, his seed pouring out in thick, creamy ropes. The huge teen gasped as he came down from his orgasm, his muscles twitching and his senses in overdrive.<br />
&quot;Good job, son,&quot; Derek said, his voice strained. &quot;I&#39;ll let you rest up. Your body needs time to adjust to your new size.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, Dad,&quot; Jeff said, his voice trembling.<br />
Derek turned and left, his own cock rock hard and leaking through his shorts. He went downstairs to find Elias cooking breakfast.<br />
&quot;I heard Jeff,&quot; Elias said, his voice husky. &quot;I&#39;m glad you were able to help him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Derek said, his own voice strained.<br />
&quot;What do you think about his size?&quot; Elias asked, his hand sliding into Derek&#39;s shorts.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s definitely bigger than the two of us,&quot; Derek said, his voice strained. &quot;But his cousine, Dave, is about the same size.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dave is coming over later today, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Elias asked, his voice husky.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Derek growled, his cock throbbing in Elias&#39; hand.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that he might be even bigger than Jeff,&quot; Elias said.<br />
&quot;Who is bigger than me?&quot; a voice called from the stairs. Jeff stood at the top of the steps, his giant cock still rock hard and hanging between his thighs.<br />
&quot;Oh, Jeffery,&quot; Derek said, his voice strained. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
&quot;I feel great,&quot; Jeff said, his cock bobbing as he walked down the stairs. &quot;I think I&#39;m even bigger than before.&quot;<br />
&quot;You certainly are,&quot; Elias said, his voice husky. &quot;You&#39;re definitely bigger than either of us now.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, I&#39;m bigger than Dave, then?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;We will see. They are coming today for a lunch&quot; Derek said.<br />
&quot;Well, we should get some breakfast,&quot; Elias said. He pulled out some plates and started serving the food. He put tons of food on Jeff&#39;s plate. Young muscle god ate as twice as much as Elias and Derek, whose plates were overflowing as well. When they finished, Derek cleaned up the dishes and went to go get ready for work.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still hungry,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Can you make me a shake, please?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Elias said. He went to the kitchen and got the blender ready. He poured in some protein powder, some milk, and some ice. He started it up and blended it up into a smooth shake.<br />
&quot;Here you go,&quot; Elias said, handing Jeff the drink. Jeff took the glass and drank it all in a few gulps.<br />
&quot;Mmm, that was good, but it is not my favorite cup. It may be suits your size, not mine&quot; <br />
&quot;But is your favorite cup&quot; Elias said.<br />
&quot;It used to be my favorite when I was six, dad. It is just 1 gallon. Where is my real one?&quot;<br />
&quot;OK, I do another one in old cauldron&quot; said Elias<br />
&quot;I want that&quot; Jeff said.<br />
Elias got out the blender and started making another shake in old copper cauldron, which volume was 20 gallons. Jeff waited patiently while Elias made the shake. When he was done, he asked Jeff to take it becuase for Elias it was too heavy to hand it. Jeff grabbed the cauldron and brought it to his lips, drinking the shake down in big gulps. After a few minutes, he drained the whole thing, leaving it empty.<br />
&quot;Thank you, Dad,&quot; Jeff said. His stomach felt full, but he knew that wasn&#39;t going to last long.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Elias said. &quot;Now you are going to the gym, right? Day session.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I need to get bigger,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
Jeff went downstairs to the basement gym. It was big enough for a 5-man workout. There was a bench press, a squat rack, a couple of free weights, and a squat machine. All of them were designed for a really big guys, each plate in machines were 50 lbs and plates for bars started from 25 lbs up to 500 lbs. Jeff went over to the squat rack and started doing squats with the bar and some heavy weights. After a few sets, he started adding more and more weight until he was lifting a ton. His muscles were bulging, and his body was sweating. He kept going, pumping iron, building muscle.<br />
After a few hours his father called him to come up and be ready for a lunch. His cousine is coming.<br />
&quot;Okay dad&quot; he said and he put the weight bar down and walked up to the house. He was really hungry, and he could smell the food that his dad was cooking.<br />
&quot;I am very hungry.&quot;<br />
The doorbell rang, and Jeff got up to answer it. He opened the door and did not understand what he saw. It was like someone put a black screen near their door. Than this black screen said with deep bass voice<br />
&quot;Hey cuz, nice to see you. What&#39;s up? Do you mind to let me in? Your door is a bit smaller than I remember and it is hard to squizze when you are staying here&quot; Dave smiled.<br />
&quot;Uhm, hi Dave. Yeah, come in.&quot; Jeff was a bit startled by his cousin&#39;s massive size. He could not believe that Dave was this big.<br />
&quot;Thanks man. Your dad&#39;s cooking, right? I can smell it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, he is. So, how have you been? How are things with you and your parents?&quot;<br />
&quot;Great. Mom and Dad are really happy with my growth. They say I&#39;m becoming a fine young man.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Jeff was trying to understand what shoud he do. He should be the hugest, but now when Jeff was looking at his cousine, Dave, he understood that the other guy is bigger.<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;s it going with you? How are things at home?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhm, yeah, I am doing great. Please, go to the dining hall I&#39;ll be a minute&quot;<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot;<br />
Jeff closed the door and went to his room. His mind was spinning, how his cousine could be this big? Why his dads didn&#39;t tell him? He was getting angry. He opened Chronivac. He was thinking, and then he realized why. &quot;The genes of his grandgrandpa, who was even bigger than Dave went to Dave&#39;s family and not to his own, but ... it can be managed&quot; Jeff thought. He adjust new changes with his ancestors and push the button. The machine began to work. <br />
&quot;Jeff! We are waiting for you&quot; Alias shouted from the 1st floor.<br />
&quot;Okay, dad. I am comming&quot; he responded and went down.<br />
&quot;Hey, Jeff&quot; Dave said. &quot;I was looking at your weights in the gym, and they are awesome&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, Dave. You can use them whenever you are comming here&quot;<br />
&quot;Cool. Thanks, man.&quot;<br />
Two big men were sitting at the table and waiting for food. Elias was bringing it from the kitchen.<br />
&quot;Wow, this smells great, Elias.&quot;<br />
When they started eating, Jeff was able to see that amount of food on his plate was increasing. And his plate and his dad&#39;s plate were increasing in size. But Dave&#39;s plate was getting smaller. Elias and Dave were not noticing anything, they were discussing Dave&#39;s family. Jeff saw that his Dad becoming more and more bigger, his frame was bulging and muscles were becoming stronger. It was not happening only to Elias, but to Jeff as well.<br />
&quot;Hey, Jeff, are you alright?&quot; Elias asked. &quot;You are not eating much.&quot;<br />
Jeff was able to look Dave into the eyes.<br />
&quot;I am good, thanks.&quot; they were the same size right now. Jeff was happy. <br />
He started to work with the shovel he called spoon. He could not stop eating. He was hungry, he had a hole in his stomach and food was filling it up. It was like he was in the bottomless pit. And plate was still increasing its size, the food amount stopped to do the same, because Jeff ate with the same speed it should increased. He felt that his hand started experiencing friction with his lats, but he have to finish eating. Jeff spent a few minutes to finished his lunch. Now the ceiling was much closer to his view, than before. He looked at Dave and was surprised. He was shorter than Jeff&#39;s nipples. Still with huge muscles but much smaller than him. Elias was a bit bigger than Dave too.<br />
&quot;Thanks for the meal, Elias&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;You are welcome, son.&quot; <br />
&quot;What is your size, Dave?&quot;<br />
&quot;6&#39;6&quot;, 350 pounds.&quot;<br />
&quot;Cool, dude. That is not bad.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, thanks, cuz. I am really proud of my growth. And what about you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, I have never measured myself.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it, then. Stay still&quot; said Dave and took a tape measurer.<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
He started from the bottom, when he was standing right next to Jeff&#39;s leg.<br />
&quot;Oh, my, that is 2&#39;6&quot;<br />
Then he moved his hand up and was trying to reach the top.<br />
&quot;Holy cow, that is 8&#39;8&quot;. Jeff, you are a giant!&quot;<br />
Jeff laughed.<br />
&quot;Daad, where is a scale?&quot;<br />
&quot;In the bathroom, dear&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
Jeff went to the bathroom and put his feet on the scale. It took a moment for the scale to process his weight.<br />
&quot;642 pounds.&quot; Dave read it for Jeff, becuase his pecs were too big to look at the screen.<br />
&quot;I wish one day I will be that big.&quot;<br />
Jeff was thinking what can he do. Than he realized. He asked Dave went down to home gym and warm up waitning to him. Jeff went to the his room. Millions of years of human evolution made him this big. What would happend if he use his own genes to grow ancient humans? How would it look?<br />
Jeff putted a command to the machine and left. Chronivac began working, changing the human history.<br />
