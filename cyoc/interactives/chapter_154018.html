<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The room of teenagers and Fido turned to the front entrance to see Sofya’s father standing there silently. He stood there quietly, staring at them with a stoic expression on his face. He took off his black trenchant and hat and proceeded to close the door behind him. Eyeing over the other boys, Sofya’s father started to internally rage. His daughter was, once again, whoring herself to every boy in the neighborhood. He wished she’d close her legs for once, or at the very least, stick to fucking one man at a time, and not in a common area of the house. <br />
<br />
The teenage boys gulped as they looked at her father with embarrassment on their faces. Daniel continued to cry over his bite marks, while Duane showed concern over the profuse bleeding still coming out of his former friend’s arm wounds. Sofya was embarrassed at her nude state. She didn’t think her father would be home until late in the evening. <br />
<br />
“Why is he home so soon?” Sofya thought to herself. <br />
<br />
“Sofya…” her father called to her coldly.<br />
<br />
“Daddy…” she replied. <br />
<br />
“What is going on here? Who are these boys and why are you naked?”<br />
<br />
“Uh...”<br />
<br />
Sofya thought for a moment as she stared at the other boys. She was shocked that they weren’t already trying to get dressed. It was as if they were frozen in fear. <br />
<br />
“These are some boys from school who came over to hang out today. We were just about to order dinner and chill for a while. And I thought you weren’t supposed to be home until later tonight. Why are you home so soon?”<br />
<br />
“Change of plans. Sofya…..”<br />
<br />
Her father stared at her calmly, but she knew behind his cool demeanor, he’d mean business when he spoke up again. <br />
<br />
“What have I told you about having boys over alone in the house by yourself?”<br />
<br />
“Daddy, it’s not that big of a deal. I’m 17 years old. I’m almost an adult and….”<br />
<br />
“But you’re not an adult” her father replied coldly. “And I want these boys out of my house, now.”<br />
<br />
The boys hesitated as they looked at him nervously. <br />
<br />
“Now!” he boomed. <br />
<br />
The teenage boys yelped as they tried to gather their things. When they collected their clothes and other items, they didn’t even think to get re-dressed as they ran out of the house butt naked. While the other boys scurried off, Sofya’s father stared carefully at Daniel and Duane. They still remained in his house, as Daniel continued to bleed, while Duane watched the arm bleeding profusely.<br />
<br />
“What happened to this boy?” Sofya’s father asked calmly. <br />
<br />
“The dog I told you about must have bitten his arm” she replied. “The wound is looking really bad. I think we should call a doctor.”<br />
<br />
“Young man” her father called to Daniel.<br />
<br />
Daniel looked up at Sofya’s father, sobbing uncontrollably, as Duane tried to get the bleeding to stop.<br />
<br />
“You should go to an emergency room right this second. If you don’t seek medical attention for that wound of yours soon, you might end up losing function of your arm permanently.”<br />
<br />
Daniel nodded, sobbing as he ran out of the house. Duane ran behind him.<br />
<br />
“But wait…” her father called to him before Daniel could fully exit his house. <br />
<br />
Daniel turned up to look at Sofya’s father, in too much pain to be afraid of the intimidating man before him. Duane turned to look at him as well.<br />
<br />
“If the doctor asks where you got the bite from, lie….”<br />
<br />
“But sir….” Daniel replied nervously.<br />
<br />
“Lie!” Sofya’s father yelled. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go, Daniel” Duane said, as he dragged him to the street, hearing his former friend screaming in agony. <br />
<br />
After he closed the door, Sofya’s father looked to her curiously. <br />
<br />
“That dog seems like he’s a bit of trouble” her father said to break the silence that fell upon them. <br />
<br />
“One of my classmates, not one of those boys, asked me to watch him for a while. He’s a stray dog, so he might have rabies. I think we should call the pound. Maybe keeping him here isn’t such a good idea after all.”<br />
<br />
Fido whined loudly.<br />
<br />
“Don’t” her father replied.<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father had made a determination when he read the message from his daughter of finding a stray dog on the loose. He was after the Ruggeri ring and deduced that, based on its mysterious appearance and the inability to find its current owner, the dog was a boy who had been affected by the ring’s magical curse. If that were the case, then he wanted to keep the dog, whose body possessed this boy’s being, in his peripheral at all times. The biting may have made this goal more challenging to execute, but it could be used as an excuse later to euthanize it when he found what he had been looking for in this town and had no need for the dog any longer. <br />
<br />
“The law says that you get two chances in regards to dog bites” he continued. “If the dog bites someone else, then we’ll send it to the pound to euthanize.”<br />
<br />
Fido whined loudly as he laid down on the floor. <br />
<br />
“But in the meantime” her father went on “we’ll keep him here and hope that its rightful owner eventually comes by to claim him. Of course, Sofya, based on his bad behavior, it’s always possible that he was abandoned…and for good reason, it seems.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father glared at Fido, as he could hear him whining loudly at the scolding. <br />
<br />
“Ok Daddy” Sofya replied quietly. “I was going to order dinner soon. Did you want me to get you something?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t bother” he replied. “I went grocery shopping and I want to cook dinner tonight. Is Beef Stroganoff ok with you?”<br />
<br />
“Sure….” she replied cautiously. <br />
<br />
“And I bought the dog food you asked for” he added.<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father held up a bag of dog food, as Fido whined quietly at the sight. <br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself. “Not another dinner of dog food. Yuck!”<br />
<br />
“Now go upstairs” Sofya’s father commanded her “and get yourself and the dog cleaned up.”<br />
<br />
“Yes daddy” she replied, feeling absolutely miserable and embarrassed. <br />
<br />
Sofya motioned to Fido. <br />
<br />
“Come on, boy” she called to Fido. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as he got up from the floor and followed a naked Sofya upstairs to the bathroom. Sofya’s father processed the mess that was made in the living room. He was fuming over the fact that Sofya had whored herself to six boys at once.<br />
<br />
“However” he thought to himself “she isn’t totally inept.”<br />
<br />
The fact that she got her hands on the dog, who may be the victim of the Ruggeri ring’s curse, was a positive and much needed development. It narrowed down the search for the ring. While the person who is cursed was in his possession, it might attract the person who placed the curse on them into his house. The person may seek out the dog and it would bring this person right to his door step. If that were to occur, they would be on his domain. He’d have all of the advantage, having bugged his house with many magical booby traps and other assorted spells. Little did Sofya’s father know that someone else, the possessor of the ring, did some bugging of their own. <br />
<br />
