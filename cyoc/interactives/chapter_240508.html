<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How’s it looking, Doc Eugene?” Sadie asked, “Got any idea why Montana aint’ eatin’?”<br />
<br />
The 29-year-old large-animal veterinarian circled around the pregnant paint mare, palpating her stomach while running his other hand along her boney haunches. He turned to the 23-year-old farm girl, eyes unconsciously drifting down to her impressive breasts for a moment before awkwardly jerking upwards to look her in the face.<br />
<br />
“Ahem – Ma’am.” He cleared his throat. “I’m just running through my diagnostics here. You say she hasn’t been eating?”<br />
<br />
“That’s right.” Sadie stroked the mare’s side. “She’s gonna be a mama at two and a half. I didn’t mean for her to get pregnant when she was so young, but one of our stallions ran through the fence to get to her one night about eight months ago now!”<br />
<br />
“Her first time with a foal, huh?” Eugene mumbled, wiping the sweat off his brow as he readjusted his glasses. He leaned back towards the mare, digging his hand into the side of the mare swollen baby bump eliciting an uncomfortable snort from the horse. “First times can be tough, huh, little miss?”<br />
<br />
Montana grumbled out a frustrated whicker as if she were agreeing, her wobbly, boney legs teetering back and forth as the thin vet continued to prod against her belly. She was awfully pregnant for sure, that giant tummy stretched taut by her womb was the only thing that was fat and plump on her. Her hip bones stuck conspicuously out of her croup with only a thin layer of piebald hide covering them. Her rib cage was visible just in front of her huge belly and she seemed far too lethargic for such a young horse.<br />
<br />
“Find anything yet, Doc?” she asked, worry growing on her face as she watched the mare anxious tottering this way and that as Eugene examined her.<br />
<br />
“Just checking for blockages in her intestines… Colic in a pregnant girl like her would be difficult treat and would be pretty certain to kill her. You say she’s been like this for a while?”<br />
<br />
“Yessir.” Sadie gulped, sweating a little as she feared her precious mare may not pull through this. “I’d say she’s been eating less and less the whole month. She ain’t grazing and she hardly touches any oats I try to feed her.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you know what they say: ‘You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make ‘em drink’. The same goes for oats.” The vet commented, running his hand along her rear squishing his hand against her think flanks. “There’s nothing obviously wrong with her so far. I hate to say it, but sometimes it’s just that they lose the will to eat. You can try to induce hunger but again, it’s not a sure thing.”<br />
<br />
“She just… doesn’t want to eat!?” the girl stared on at the mare, perplexed. “Come on, that’s not the answer I’m lookin’ for! I tried damn near everything already to get food in her… Come on, doc, I’d be shattered if I just let Montana here wither away. I’ve been taking care of her ever since her mama gave birth to her.”<br />
<br />
“It’s unthinkable, I know.” Eugene huffed. “But with a mare her age, any number of things could go wrong while pregnant. It’s not so much their body, but their mental state too. They don’t know how to feel or what to do and all the stresses just keeps them from doing much of anything! It’s not your fault, these sorta things just happen.”<br />
<br />
Worry began evolving into fear of Sadie’s face, realizing there was a whole host of problems that was causing a quiet panic in her tired mama mare. Of course Montana was frightened, it was so obvious! The mare had been growing stiff and unperceptive, startling and scaring really easy. Sadie’s mind reeled thinking of the remaining things that she didn’t try to help, the girl biting her lower lip as she stared over at the vet, thinking of one last idea.<br />
<br />
“So… you’re saying it’s just her mentals?” Sadie clarified, really trying to make sure about what she was about to do. “If she like… I dunno, knew pregnancy through and through like you do, she could calm down, eat, and have her foal just fine?”<br />
<br />
“Well.” Euguene let out an amused huff as he pulled a latex glove out of his pocket. His gloved fingers then began to circle around Montana’s tail hole, gently trying press his ring and index digits inside to see if there were any blockages in her rectum. “It’s awfully presumptuous of me to say I’d make a better mama than her, but I do know more about what’s going on inside her than she does. I’ve seen hundreds of pregnant mares before, so I probably do know a thing or two more than she does about pregnancy; at least from the outside, that is!”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, alright.” Sadie’s voice hushed faint as she slowly stepped out of the stall and fetched something from the nearby supply closet. It was something called a ‘Chronovac’, some weird doodad her grandpa came across long ago and told her to only use when she really needed it. It was pretty hefty and sort of had the dimensions of a portable camera you’d see on a movie set, but it had all sorts of nobs and switches that’d change all sorts of options on the screen attached to it.  She wasn’t exactly sure what it did, but according to gramps, it could do darn near everything, so it had to be able to save Montana… somehow.<br />
<br />
“Alright… Montana’s not ready to be a mama for the first time… she needs help.” Sadie muttered to herself as she flicked the device on, using a switch to navigate options.<br />
<br />
There were all sorts of things so could do… but what would be the Panacea that’d save her horse? She could change Montana’s demeanor; she could make her happy and hungry and all sorts of things… but who knows if that’d actually make her eat?<br />
<br />
She could make her fat and fill her tummy with those oats herself but… what if she really did have a colic? If she tried to digest all that it’d kill her.<br />
<br />
Sadie stepped back towards the stall, getting a look at the veterinarian slinking his gloved hand up the horse’s anus, the mare jittering in place with her tail held high as the doctor tried to find any other issues inside her digestive tract.<br />
<br />
Gosh. He really seemed to know everything about pregnancy in horses. Maybe if she could just… borrow him for a while, let him go deeper inside Montana’s life to make sure he knew about her problems and address them, then her mare would live for sure.<br />
<br />
Sadie began to sweat, her ample pair of breasts jiggling in her Hickory Farms T-shirt as she fiddled with the options, making sure everything was set to her liking. She pressed a trigger button on the Chronovac’s handle, figuring if she’d point it at Eugene, it’d take effect. But the most difficult part of all was… how could she possibly explain this to him?<br />
<br />
“D-Dr. Eugene… I…” Sadie studdered, gaze turned towards the ground as she tried to quickly inform him about what she just did.<br />
<br />
“Hold your horses.” The vet cut her off, busy with the horse’s rectal exam. “I’ve got my hand up a mare’s ass. Just need to focus so I’m not in it for long.”<br />
<br />
He pushed his hand up to the wrist, feeling that tight ring of tail hole flex around him, anal goo lubing up his arm as he pushed in little by little.<br />
<br />
It was strange. Montana didn’t share that ambient barnyard-stink that was emanating around the stable, that is to say, her ass didn’t smell like shit. She seemed astonishing clean on the outside, and he couldn’t feel anything at all inside either – neither a blockage nor poop. Maybe since she wasn’t eating, she wasn’t pooping, but that was preposterous, not even a thorough washing with an enema could leave a horse this clean inside.<br />
<br />
“D-doctor!” Sadie balled her hands into nervous fists, as she tried to get Eugene’s attention. “I think I really need to tell you about something, I used this thing over here to change-”<br />
<br />
“Not now!” The vet shot back, his voice suddenly blaringly agitated as he felt that anal rung clamp extra tight around his forearm, locking him inside like a Chinese finger trap.<br />
<br />
Despite Montana looking so weak, her ass had a death grip on his hand, the mare taking a shaky step backwards to let Eugene’s arm sink up passed the elbow inside of her. Her anus seemed to get bigger… her ass did too! Those boney protrusions of hip and leg joints defining her malnourished body seemed to abruptly sink under a carpet of expanding fat, Eugene’s shoulder mashing against that flaring ring of horse sphincter as Montana ardently forced herself back against the man.<br />
<br />
Sadie was at a loss for words. The Chronovac was doing exactly what she programmed it to do, but in such a lewd way! She watched helplessly as Montana snort haughtily, her anus undulating wider and wider with fitful bursts of muscles and flesh as reality itself seemed to warp in a singularity centered on her ass. Eugene’s head got drenched it anal lube as it suddenly slipped right inside her!<br />
<br />
“Augh! I’m sorry, just don’t struggle!” Sadie cried out to the vet, watching his legs flail around as the mare man-eating ass slipped over his other shoulder and swallowed his other arm. A hot sauna of horse sweat dripping from Montana’s hide began to fill that air as the pregnant mare snort out smokey puffs of steam from her nostrils. She pushed back with everything she had, the man’s belly slipping inside her anus that had stretched to the size of an innertube in a matter of seconds!<br />
<br />
Inside, Eugene felt like a bug suddenly snatched up by a venus flytrap out of nowhere. At one moment he was out in the light of day, the next he was inside the mare he was supposed to be caring for! Just as he suspected from the outside, her undulating pinkish innards were clean, a slick mucosal lining of anal lube painting the walls of Montana’s intestines as smooth muscles deep inside the mare forced him in deeper through peristaltic motion. He tried to fight it, punching and gripping and biting at her walls, but he just couldn’t seem to make her even flinch! He was going deeper inside her whether he liked it or not.<br />
<br />
Montana’s inside where unbearably hot, the vet sweating like a roasting pig as the wriggling walls of horse intestines slowly kneaded across his body, gently tugging off his shirt and pants, stripping him of cloths. The sounds of the outside, the sounds of Sadie screaming for him were almost completely drowned out by the sloppy, squelching sound of lube splashing and slurping all around him. Each and every errant twitch of her muscles squeezed against the intruding man, the mare’s powerful engine of a heart made Montana’s inner confines shudder as it beat. The incessant drum-like tattoo of her heat grew more intense as the vet’s feet disappeared inside, leaving the man completely subordinate to the whims of the mare’s body as he lay submerged inside her butt.<br />
<br />
His fighting grew weak as breathing grew harder, the tightening intestinal track forcing wind from his lungs as that clean-tasting slime of anal goo slopped inside his huffing maw to replace it. It was all making him feel dizzy. Even though he was only inside for a minute, the slow movement of time made it feel like hours. Eugene curled up into a fetal ball, the man saying his prayers, ready to accept his end until he somehow slipped into a fleshy cavity that seemed… a little more spacious.<br />
<br />
Breathing was nigh impossible still, so little oxygen reaching the naked man’s lungs from deep inside the horse that he’d still be dead for sure. Yet despite the lack of oxygen, it oddly felt okay now that he wasn’t so restricted. The horse’s balmy warmth radiated from all around him as slick, satin-like walls massaged every inch of his bare skin. Eugene thought about how there were certainly worse ways to go as he drifted off into unconsciousness, the mare’s body heat washing over him as in his last moments, he felt some sort of thing slither along his belly, a searing hot sensation emanating from his naval as horse flesh fused to his.<br />
<br />
Light.<br />
<br />
Eugene’s huge eye’s blinked as he suddenly saw himself looking out through a window in the horse’s stall, spotting Sadie out of his other eye standing beside him, stroking his… belly?<br />
<br />
Something was wrong – terribly, desperately wrong! As the vet fought to regain his bearings, he found that his body wasn’t anything like he remembered it being. His well-trained, dexterous fingers felt sparce, the feeling in his hand reduced to one long barbell of a finger as he tried lifting it, only to hear a heavy hoof tap on the ground in response.<br />
<br />
He started to panic. Sensations seemed distorted, Eugene feeling stretched out and bloated as if ever feature of his hot, muscular, and massive body didn’t belong to him! As he trembled on all fours, a long, he felt a ponytail draped over his butt, the vet even able to control it as he swat the air frantically behind him. As the mare that Eugene found himself inhabiting clattered back on four untrained legs, the horse almost tripped over herself as Eugene felt her gigantic pregnant belly sway, her foal inside kicking.<br />
<br />
Sadie was dumb with awe as she had just witnessed Montana change in a matter of moments. Her eye colored shifted from brown into baby blues like the vet’s. The color of her mane and tail shifted into Eugene’s rugged brown as the mare’s belly fattened up even more, the arm tattoo of some sort of Japanese Kanji word that Eugene had suddenly branding into Montana’s foreleg as the vet’s glasses magically materialized on the mare’s face out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Just like she’d told the Chronovac to, the vet was now inhabiting Montana’s body. Her horse’s consciousness had been gently pushed inside in her own body, augmenting Eugene’s brain with horse instincts as he took control of her pregnant form for her. Now the only quest was… was Eugene okay with it?<br />
<br />
“H-hey, girl! Err… Eu-gene!” Sadie called out, trying to grab the vet by the halter as she whinnied a terrified cry, the horse’s eyes darting this way and that, dilating wide as she found out she couldn’t speak anymore! “Just calm down! I can explain! I can explain why you’re her now!”<br />
<br />
Eugene could understand her, but didn’t have presence of mind to listen! Every synaptic nerve firing within the confines of her brain were ravished by the new sensations plaguing her body. Each and every errant twitch of her glistening pussy lips felt orgasmic. Each time she squashed her voluptuous horse thighs together; she could feel her fatty mare udders tortuously writhe in bliss beneath her. It was too much! Sensation upon sensation washed over the vet’s analytic mind as she fought to make sense of it all. Deep in her body, Eugene sensed her own curled up human form buried deep inside the recesses of her intestines, inside a fleshy cove in her duodenum. Her body took care of it, flooding equine nourishment into the smaller body to keep her human form alive in its stasis.<br />
<br />
Eugene clenched, the mare screeching loud with panicked whinnies as she struggled to free herself from the confines of her mare body! She mashed whatever muscles she had back there to squeeze him out like a tube of toothpaste, the mare sensing her human body move out and stir as she thrashed around and pushed for dear life! She felt like she was constipated, like she were giving birth to the worst bowel movement anyone had ever experienced. As Sadie tried in vain to calm her down, she fought harder and harder as she felt her anus start to expand, her own human head crowing from her ass until it finally plopped out onto a bed of hay like a newborn foal.<br />
<br />
“GAH!” Eugene the human splayed open from his fetal position, spitting out the mare’s anal goo that had been drenching the insides of his maw. Despite his befuddlement, he seemed relieved to be out of the ordeal. It was the contrary feeling that both Sadie and Montana seemed to be expressing.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Eugene, sir! I need to tell you what just happened!” Sadie quickly shouted at the vet, walking over to Eugene as he laid back naked in the hay.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… what the hell…?” He slurred out deliriously, letting the feeling of fresh air pass over him as he entered to state of mind to listen.<br />
<br />
“I have this device thing her that made this happen! It’s the Chrono-whatcha-ma-call-it that did it!” The girl tried to get an explanation all out at once, fumbling over her words as she talked at a race-car pace. “I-I thought you were the only one that could help Montana get better, so I thought if you could get inside her and help her work through all this, it’d go smoothly! I sorta… programmed you to go through the back door so you could join her as… well… her! I made it so you’d be a horse with her and to let you take the reins over her body so you could control things and keep her from stressing.”<br />
<br />
Eugene gazed off into the corner of the room with an incredulous 100-yard-star, only partially grasping what he was hearing, unsure if any of that made any sense.<br />
<br />
“You were safe inside Montana, I swear! She was gonna feed your body like she’d feed a foal as you’d lead her about in her head! I’m sorry I didn’t tell you beforehand, but I wasn’t sure it’d work either! I just wanted to save her; I just wanted you to help her!”<br />
<br />
Again, the words made sense, but the vet could hardly make any sense of them. He turned into a horse? It was ludicrous, but… he did remember it. How it felt to be so big and sturdy, what it felt like to have hooves, udders and… be a girl. He’d be lying if he didn’t admit in all his years of helping out pregnant mares that he’d never once wondered what it was like…<br />
<br />
“And it wasn’t supposed to be chaos either, I made rules to the whole thing.” Sadie clarified, “You enter through the animal’s backdoor and hook up to ‘em. Inside ‘em you’ll basically live just like you were her. Your human body won’t age while inside her, and I made it so only those who witness the whole thing would know what happened. Once you were in her, as far as the rest of the world knew, Eugene never existed, and you were always the mare. Not even your mama ever would ever know that you were born a human!”<br />
<br />
The vet’s gaze rose to hers if his eyes said what his exhausted voice couldn’t. “Do I… still exist?”<br />
<br />
“You exist again now that you’re out of her! Everyone knows Dr. Eugene again, it’s all okay!” Sadie explained quickly, trying to alleviate all his fears. “I’m so sorry I scared ya. I just needed to get help for Montana – I don’t know what I’d do if I lose her. And, hey – she wasn’t scared at all either. In fact, I think she’d liked the company inside her. She liked it when you went in too.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t…” the vet panted, looking up at the mare as she starred into his face with an odd, animalistic satisfaction in those big brown eyes of hers. “…know what to say.”<br />
<br />
“W-well.” Sadie stammered. “Can you say, ‘yes’? I know this is probably the weirdest treatment you’ve ever gave to a horse, but I want you to try again. I promise there’s no harm in it, plus I’ll take extra good care of you like I do with all my other animals. So… please? Just until the foal is born, then you can just push yourself out like you just did.”<br />
<br />
Doing something like this willingly was unthinkable, but he couldn’t say no to a pretty girl like her. He couldn’t believe he was about to do this…<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
One month later, Sadie was happily tending to her paint mare, Montana, the horse sporting Eugene’s brown mane and tail as well as that silly pair of glasses balanced on her long nose. She caried a bucket into the stall filled with warm, soapy water, wetting a sponge inside as she began washing the mare’s white and brown piebald belly, making her clean and soft like she’d liked.<br />
<br />
Montana scoured up a mouthful of oats from a nearby bucket, her figure having taken a 180 degree turn from that near skeleton of a horse she was a month ago to a plump, happy, pregnant mare.<br />
<br />
“Someone’s having a good day, huh?” Sadie cooed in a high pitch voice as if she were talking to a pet. “Gotten a lot to eat huh? Grazing all day and a whole bucket of oats, you’re quite the little piggy, miss!”<br />
<br />
Sadie giddily worked her fingers into Montana’s plump side, feeling that plush layer of fat underneath that soft horse hide squish lusciously underneath the pressure. Hell, she’d probably gotten too fat now! The mare’s pregnant belly had grown so wide it had become a bit of an ordeal to fetch her out of her stall now. The farm girl smiled as she felt a bump press out beneath that taut horse hide, then again and again! Her foal was kicking. The baby baking inside her was excited and healthy, growing ripe in its mama as it awaited its birth in two months or so.<br />
<br />
Montana kept scoffing up oats like the animal she was. Early on a month back she seemed super embarrassed when Sadie would talk to her like a baby, but now she seemed to love it, the former vet taken to grazing, socializing, and even giving out pony rides like a bona fide horse! The farm girl’s hand trailed down Montana’s belly to the her plump pink udders, snickering as she started to tease her horse even more.<br />
<br />
“These are getting bigger too – If I’d of known any better, I’d think you’re part cow too – not just part human!” Sadie giggled as she ducked underneath Montana, stroking and tugging those rubber-like nubs of horse udders. “I bet you love ‘em this big though, huh?”<br />
<br />
Sadie wrapped her hand around one and pulled, Montana whickering as she threw her head out of her bucket, Eugene’s mind inside losing all inhibitions as Sadie’s teasing drenched her brain in feral bliss. Her tail hiked up with every tug on her equine mammaries, little dribbles of cream beginning to ooze out as Sadie lips huffed a puff of hot air onto the sensitive horse teat.<br />
<br />
“You were born to be a mama, huh? A real broodmare - just can’t wait to have a foal sucking on these tiddies, I bet!”<br />
<br />
Eugene’s lust-addled mind responded with another shrill whinny, her puffy, pink pussy starting to soak with need as steaming-hot mare juices dribbled down her ass, wetting her udder with her feral femineity as Sadie tended to her. To make matters worse, Sadie’s mouth suddenly latched around a teat, her lips nipping and slurping on the milky udder as Montana’s body thrashed and shivered, her hooves clopping in place as she kept whinnying like the horse she was – like the horse she never knew she’d wanted to be just a month ago!<br />
<br />
She was taken care of as an animal, her giant belly weighed down with a healthy foal. Her pregnancy forced horse-hormones throughout her system that made her high on the feeling of motherhood. Sensing her curled up human form inside her, she wondered if he’d be alright staying in there forever… wondering if she’d ever have the heart to push him out after her first foal had been born.<br />
<br />
She wanted more. More horse babies. More horse milk. More horse sex. Anything that’d make her feel less Eugene and more Montana – she wanted that!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Unknown to Sadie, that change she made to reality with the Chronovac didn’t just apply to Eugene, but the entire world. Animals both male and female were now able to absorb a human inside through their ‘backdoor’, in fact, most animals would even love doing it. The Chronovac distorted reality to the point that even an animal as small as a mouse could paradoxically harbor a full-grown human inside. That animal would adopt some of their human’s defining features, tattoos, jewelry, hairstyles appearing once the human was pulled inside. While inside, no one will know the human ever existed.<br />
<br />
Some people would find out about this tear in reality. Some would keep it a secret while others would make it a business. Some would use it as a vacation, while others would use it as torture.<br />
<br />
People were going discover the ‘backdoor change’ very soon, the only question was, how would they use it?</p>
