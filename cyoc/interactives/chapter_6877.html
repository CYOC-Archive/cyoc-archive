<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ricki saw the changes first.  “Look at his nails!” she exclaimed.  <br />
<br />
“Oh my God,” Tabitha muttered.<br />
<br />
She had every reason to be flabbergasted.  Her son’s fingernails were growing long and were being painted pink by some unseen force.  Brendon looked at his nails and said, “Oh shit.”  His voice already sounded higher.  He somehow knew what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
Ricki knew, too.  “Don’t fight it,” she warned.  “It will only make it worse.”  Brendon’s very short, blonde hair began to grow wildly down his shoulders.  It stopped growing halfway down his back, now curly, full, and very much beautiful.  His toenails changed to pink in color to match his fingernails.<br />
<br />
The changes continued next in his face.  His nose narrowed as his cheeks rounded.  He grabbed at his face, feeling a decent amount of pain from the changes.  Every few seconds he removed his hands, only to replace them at his face again.  Each time he did so, Tabitha and Ricki saw something different in his face.  First, his lips were full and deeply red.  Then his cheeks were completely feminine.  The color of his eyes softened to a sky blue, while his eyelashes were longer.  In a matter of seconds, Brendon’s face had completely disappeared, replaced by a female face, one that was very attractive at that.<br />
<br />
Ricki felt herself getting turned on by his changes.  She felt her nipples stiffen as she watched her stepson’s his grow wide and waist thin, just as hers had done only an hour or so ago.  His stomach and shoulders flattened and narrowed as his ass became round.  It appeared that he was developing a figure that would be just as curvy and voluptuous as Ricki’s.  <br />
<br />
Ricki looked over at Tabitha.  Her eyes were transfixed on what was happening to her son.  She couldn’t believe her eyes.  If she still had some doubt that Ricki was in fact Rick, they were going away just as quickly as Brendon was changing.  But Ricki noticed something else about her wife.  Her nipples were very apparent, sticking out through her shirt.  Rick had always tried to get Tabitha to admit she had a thing for other women, from back before they were married.  That was because Tabitha used to say she was “very wild” as a teenager and young adult.  But she never admitted to Rick that she had any such feelings.  Ricki smiled as it was now obvious that she did.<br />
<br />
Brendon’s nipples and areolas started to stretch outward.  His breasts grew out soon after.  Just like Ricki’s, they stopped growing at D cups.  They were perfect in every possible way.  Brendon seemed to now be enjoying his change, for he started to play with his new breasts as they grew.  By this time his legs and arms had already thinned, but they kept the same slight muscle tone that Brendon’s arms and legs had possessed.  All of his body hair, besides his pubic hair and the hair on his head, had also retracted into his skin.  <br />
<br />
His penis started to shrink now.  His testicles separated and formed the lips of his pussy, allowing his penis to transform into his new clitoris easier.  Brendon was definitely enjoying his change now, as he began to rub his penis, feeling intense pleasure as he did.  He kept his hand on it even as it sucked up into his pussy.  He kept rubbing it, his fingers inside his slit, until he had his first female orgasm.  Ricki and Tabitha were absolutely amazed.  Perhaps he had taken Ricki’s advice a little too seriously.  <br />
<br />
Brendon opened his eyes, realizing what he had just done.  But he did not seem to care, as he jumped off the bed and stood in front of his mirror.  He gasped sharply at the sight before him.  Then he smiled wide as he ran his hands all up and down his body.  His hands seemed particularly interested in his breasts and ass.  He turned back to look at Ricki and Tabitha and asked, “What do you think?”</p>
