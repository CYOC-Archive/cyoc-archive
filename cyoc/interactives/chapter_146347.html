<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben day at his desk diligently doing homework. He was alone in his dorm, his roommate Kyle had gone out. <br />
<br />
Ben stared out of the window. What a rainy afternoon it was. His power flickered and went out. <br />
<br />
Great, he thought. <br />
<br />
Ben lived in one of the worst dorms on campus. Rumor was that none of the electricians liked each other when constructing this dorm, and that they had intentionally decided to thwart each other. <br />
<br />
Ben grabbed his homework and left the dark room for the bottom floor. In a large centralized area, this dorm had various couches, game tables, and activities to do. This floor had power, and Ben sat off at a corner table to finish his homework. <br />
<br />
As more and more people piled into the room, someone had run in from the rain. Ben saw his roommate Kyle soaking wet in the doorway, but with a wild grin on it. He too had spotted Kyle, and practically bounded over. <br />
<br />
“Hey Ben!” he said out of breath. He had a strange circle imprinted on his hand, but it was barely noticeable. “How about this rain huh?” <br />
<br />
“Kyle,” Ben said sarcastically. “We live in one of the rainiest parts of the country. It rains here more often than most places.”<br />
<br />
Kyle looked puzzled. “No...drought?”<br />
<br />
Ben snorted. There hadn’t been a drought here in...in ever probably. <br />
<br />
Kyle’s puzzlement turned to giddiness. He sat down on the couch next to him and pulled out a short piece of paper, as if checking some notes, and continued. <br />
<br />
“Have you noticed anything different lately?” Kyle asked. <br />
<br />
“Power’s out,” Ben said. He sighed. If this rain kept up, he wouldn’t be able to see his girlfriend Hannah for dinner. <br />
<br />
“Nothing?” Kyle said as he squirmed on the couch. His clothes were dripping water everywhere. “I just thought that since all the guys on this campus are permanently naked, you would have seen.”<br />
<br />
Ben looked around at the other guys. No, nothing that he explicitly noticed. Ben was a bit of a neat freak. He was growing annoyed with Kyle’s wet skin drenching the couch with water. The cold water seeped over and his his bare ass, and he stood up and wiped a bit up before sitting down. <br />
<br />
Kyle gulped for some reason. Ben looked at him and immediately noticed his hard-on and gave him a disgusted look. <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong with it?” Kyle asked innocently. “No one minds seeing someone else’s hard-on. Besides, you get hard-ons looking at all these naked men.”<br />
<br />
It was true, Ben thought. He didn’t know why he’d gotten angry. He sighed at his own cock. It was a bit of an unexplainable condition. He checked his watch. Damn, three hours until his date. <br />
<br />
“What’s this thing I’m supposed to have noticed,” Ben said turning to face Kyle. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Kyle said. It was as if he was gasping or struggling to get out the words. His dick was twitching. “You know how we are the most attractive two men who will ever exist?”<br />
<br />
A bit of an overstatement, but yes, the two of them were supernaturally attractive. They could literally turn a straight man gay and a gay woman straight. It was somewhat of a problem, having a bunch of guys ooh and ahh over your body, but it was something when the ladies come up. <br />
<br />
Ben looked at the crowd of people again. Nearly everyone was staring at them. This as usual though. He reached for the pencil and his arm slightly flexed. About two of the guys (real short, skinny) grabbed their waistlines and ran off. Even Kyle seemed to have trouble containing himself. At least his beauty had no effect on Ben. <br />
<br />
“I’ll cut to the chase Ben,” Kyle said. “One time when we were asleep, the college put a secret serum in the water supply.”<br />
<br />
Intriguing. <br />
<br />
“That serum has been beefing all the guys up,” he said. “And I think only you and I are able to notice.”<br />
<br />
The guys around the room, some still staring, were indeed more muscular than normal. Interesting. <br />
<br />
“So you know how there are two of you?” Kyle continued. <br />
<br />
Both bodies nodded in unison. Ben had one of his bodies grab the homework so that he could try and get it done before he left for his date. The other one attentively listened to a shivering Kyle. <br />
<br />
“And that all of the guys have twin bodies just like you, and only you or I have ever noticed that the do?” he continued. Ben modded. That’s how it had always been. Kyles two bod suddenly stared at each other longingly, and each briefly started to feel over each other for some reason. <br />
<br />
Ben was a bit weirded out, so he politely coughed, and one of them turned around to look at him. <br />
<br />
“Right,” he continued from both bodies. “I am certain that they must have used a bit of your dna in the process.”<br />
<br />
Ben was shocked. “How were they able to do that?”<br />
<br />
“I was looking at the security footage,” Kyle said. “And everyone here already had two bodies before you came here for this semester.”<br />
<br />
That was true. Ben has found it funny that he had entered a college with a bunch of buff two bodied people. <br />
<br />
“So I did some searching,” Kyle said. “They took your DNA from your last boyfriend. He was secretly an FBI agent.”<br />
<br />
That hurt Ben. He had trusted Eric. Eric has taken his dna for the experiment. Well now he had Hank. Hank was wonderful, even if he had two bodies because of an experiment. But I guess only Kyle and him really knew that. <br />
<br />
“It’s really odd that the dna they took only made people have an extra body rather than extra arms like each of your bodies have,” Kyle said in unison. <br />
<br />
Geez, he should really learn how to just use one mouth. Ben scratches his head with one upper arm arm and an itch on his other body with a lower hand. Ben looked up at the time. 15 minutes until the date with Hank. He stood both bodies up with ease, waved bye to Kyle (who had both of his mouths open for some reason) and left the building for the restaurant, trudging through the rain all the way.</p>
