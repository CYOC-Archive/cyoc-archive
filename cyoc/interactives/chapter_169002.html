<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Like a lightswitch being flipped, just like that Alec was wide awake. He felt energy coursing through his body. The stronger smells and sounds invading his senses told him he was still a Nekomata. At least now he knew that the possession didn&#39;t wear off if he fell asleep in a different body. Whether that was good or bad remained to be seen.<br />
He could hear Vivian breathing, she was still asleep. For a change he was the first to wake. <br />
He tried to move, but was still tied up. A rustle behind them caused his ears to perk up. A strange sensation. It was just the wind though. He found he could move his ears if he focused on them, moving them slightly to the direction of the sounds around them.<br />
The nekomata&#39;s ears were much more sensitive than his own. He could hear the birds, the wind rustling the leaves and at some point he was sure he heard a fish jump out of the water. The Nekomata&#39;s eyes were also much sharper than his own, even in this early dawn he could see perfectly.<br />
He took a deep breath, it felt a bit strange. The Nekomata&#39;s smaller catlike nose made the air flow differently, yet at the same time it was impressively sensitive as well. He could smell Vivian, a smell that he found oddly repulsive. Like this body wanted her away. He took another deep breath and noticed another smell.<br />
He smiled, and felt his sharp teeth slide out into the open. He could smell himself, or actually his old body. A smell that held an odd attraction on him, he felt an urge to investigate his own body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alec?&quot; <br />
He focused his ears on Vivian. &quot;Yes.&quot; Her sultry voice sounded alien to his ears.<br />
&quot;Good, so you&#39;re still her.&quot; He felt Vivian remove the restrains from his wrists.<br />
He rolled around and sat crouched on all fours. He looked down in surprise, this felt almost too natural for him.<br />
Vivian meanwhile inspected his real body. &quot;Oh dear.&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Alec stood on all fours and felt his hairs stand on end. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re still alive.&quot; Vivian turned to face him. &quot;Just pulling your paw.&quot; She looked different again. Her lips had fattened up considerably, each becoming as thick as a finger. Her now fat lips were curled in a teasing smile.<br />
Tension left his body and he sat back down. &quot;Not funny.&quot; He tried to sound angry, yet it came out closer like a sultry pout.<br />
Vivian was obviously struggling to surpress a another smile at the pouting kitty before her. She stood up to face him. He noted that her nipples were poking the fabric of her bra constructions. Her nose had started to turn up a little and she looked shorter still. <br />
&quot;Yeah I know. I&#39;m running out of time.&quot; She said in response to his stare. <br />
&quot;How do you feel? Can you even continue? Can you fight?&quot; Alec asked worriedly.<br />
&quot;Hot, but otherwise okay. I won&#39;t bother you with the details.&quot; She got up to her full length. She&#39;d lost another few inches, he estimated that compared to his old body, her head would only reach up to his chest now. <br />
Her large breasts however remained and looked comically oversized on her smaller frame with her lowest breasts reaching below her crotch. &quot;And don&#39;t worry about me fighting, I&#39;ve been fighting most of my life.&quot; She said as she adjusted her bras again.<br />
&quot;So what do you think of our options?&quot;<br />
Alec looked at his hand paws. He could feel the claws inside her stubby fingers and focused on them. Slowly they slid out. The jet black nails looked sharp enough to cut through anything. He was worried about Vivian&#39;s performance. They weren&#39;t there yet and her changes seemed to get more severe.<br />
&quot;Maybe we should try your idea of me fighting as a Nekotama. If we can bring my body along.&quot; <br />
&quot;It’s called a Nekomata. If we want to try that, maybe you should at least try running around for a bit. You said you couldn&#39;t fly as a harpy because you never learned how. So try and get acquianted with this body.&quot; She looked at Alec&#39;s own body. &quot;I&#39;m also a little worried about your own body though. It&#39;s alive, but it&#39;s like it&#39;s asleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re afraid we can&#39;t keep it safe?&quot; He purred.<br />
&quot;No, I think we can manage that. No, I&#39;m worried because I don&#39;t know if your body needs to eat or drink right now. A human body can go a long time without food, especially if it&#39;s not doing anything. But drinking might be a different story.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe I should retake it for a moment, eat and drink and then retake this?&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s an option. But I&#39;d like to limit the stress on the Nekomata. I you keep switching and taking, it might deliver undue stress.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but you seem awfully considerate about the feelings of catwoman who just tried to kill us.”<br />
Vivian shrugged causing her six large tits to jiggle and jump. &quot;I&#39;m an adventurer because I love this world. She was just doing what her instincts told her, there&#39;s no real malice in that. Or maybe I&#39;m just a cat person.&quot;<br />
Alec doubted that there was no real malice involved. Even now, whenever the wind blew past Vivian, he could smell her and a feeling of dislike crept into his mind. He wasn&#39;t going to tell her that though, that would just add more worries which they didn&#39;t need right now.<br />
&quot;Now, go test out that body while I clean up and find a way to bring your body along. You should be plenty strong to carry it, but we still need to make it easy enough to carry&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec looked at the Nekomata’s body. He was still in crouching position and honestly it felt like the most natural thing in the world. He wondered if he could walk on two feet. Slowly he stood up, it was a bit wobbly at first. But he soon found a balance in the thin catlike legs. He took a few steps. <br />
It&#39;s not as clumsy as the Harpy was, yet it didn&#39;t feel quite right either. He looked at his tails behind him and swung them, almost knocking himself of balance. <br />
The Nekomata yesterday struck at them while she was on all fours. He got back down on all fours. While his human mind told him it was awkward, for his catlike body it felt like the most natural thing in the world.<br />
He took a few careful steps. He felt light as a feather. He exploded in a sprint. His paws barely seemed to touch the ground. With each tap he felt his body burst forward at high speeds. He tried to use his tail and turn around, but lost his grip and rolled over the ground, skidding to a halt on his back near the lake. <br />
&quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
Vivian had evidently been watching while she cleaned up. &quot;Yes, just trying stuff out. Don&#39;t mind me.&quot;<br />
He got back up on all fours again and took it a little slower this time. He quickly found that trying to actively control the tail just threw him off balance. He determined it was better to not think about it, like walking and let nature do it&#39;s thing. He took another sprint and this time nailed the sharp turns he had in mind. He zoomed through the campsite. <br />
The wind through his fur, he heard and saw everything. He felt more alive than ever. Amazingly, he found her large breasts barely moving at all while he ran. Much different from his experiences as the Harpy and of the human girls he&#39;d been they barely moved.<br />
He bolted to a tree. He&#39;d seen cats to do that, he was going to run up it. Faster and faster he sprinted and jumped up, extending the sharp nails as flew through the air. He slammed hard into the tree. Leaves fluttered down and he felt his padded hands and feet sting. But to his excitement, he was still hanging on the side of the tree.<br />
&quot;Do be careful, there are no firemen in this area.&quot;<br />
&quot;No no, I meant to do that. I can do this.&quot; His sultry voice excitedly responded. <br />
He pulled a claw loose and placed it higher. Slowly he stalked up the large tree and climbed on a branche. He proudly looked out over the lake from his high vantage point. He felt invincible, then he looked down and gulped. This was a lot higher than he had anticipated. <br />
Vivian walked towards the tree clapping her hands. &quot;Impressive.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; He looked back at the way he came. How the hell was he getting down?<br />
He slowly walked backwards, his nails out and climbed down ass first, hugging the tree.<br />
&quot;By god, you&#39;re the most awkward pussy I&#39;ve ever seen climb out of a tree.&quot;<br />
He stalked to Vivian and crouched next to her, his long tails curling around his base. &quot;I&#39;d like to see you try that.&quot; <br />
Vivian half extended a hand before pulling it back awkwardly. &quot;Damn, I&#39;d give money to do that. You were faster than a speeding arrow. So what do you think?&quot; <br />
&quot;Do Nekomata&#39;s walk upright much?&quot; <br />
&quot;They can, but you don&#39;t see it often. But I think you already had that figured out.&quot;<br />
&quot;So how do I carry my own body then?&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll use you as a donkey and tie you to your back.&quot; She seemed to consider what she&#39;d just said. &quot;Now there&#39;s one of the most awkward sentences I&#39;ve ever said.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, so let&#39;s try that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She put her arms around Alec&#39;s body and watching her 6 tits squish against it made him wish he was him right now. &quot;How much do you weigh, you&#39;re very light.&quot;<br />
Alec stretched his back in preparation of his cargo. &quot;Haha.&quot; he replied as sarcastic as his sultry feline voice could muster. <br />
She dumped Alec&#39;s body on his back. <br />
&quot;Oh, I am very light.&quot;<br />
&quot;Told you.&quot; <br />
He just glared in response.<br />
Carefully she tied a rope around his Nekomata and normal body, tying them together. Once done she gave Alec a pat between the ears. His ears immediately perked up, that felt good. &quot;That&#39;s a good kitty. Now, can you move and tell me how it feels?&quot;<br />
Alec took a few steps. Either this body was extremely strong, or he really didn&#39;t weigh much. He felt the body on top shift slightly as he moved, but it seemed secure. <br />
&quot;I think this may work.&quot; He purred happily.<br />
<br />
Soon after they were on the road. For once Alec felt that he wasn&#39;t the one that slowed them down, this despite his supposedly heavy load. In fact he quickly found he had to slow down so Vivian could keep up as he darted ahead of her, even after she&#39;d also given her pack to him. <br />
&quot;So, is your curse speeding up?&quot; he asked once he let himself walk next to her.<br />
&quot;Maybe. I&#39;m no expert on magic, maybe it&#39;s just catching up to the counter measures. I&#39;d rather not find out.&quot; <br />
At one point they spotted a hare foraging. Vivian had removed his load and tried to let him hunt it. He came close, but the hare proved more nimble and escaped. <br />
<br />
Slowly the lakeside they followed transitioned into swamp area, but they kept walking until finally they reached a partially submerged grassland. Alec put a paw into the water and shivered. This body did not like this. He put his paw down and hesitated, the water reached up to his ankles.<br />
&quot;Any problems?&quot; Vivian asked as she stepped into the water. <br />
&quot;The water and soil don&#39;t feel great.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not unexpected I guess. They live in the mountains. Think you can manage?&quot;<br />
He nodded and put his other paws in, shivering as he did so.<br />
At the end of the grassland loomed the swamp. <br />
Large gnarly trees with huge roots and branches stood before them. Dark brown and green leaves grew high into the sky. Long lines of brown reeds were scattered throughout the wetlands.<br />
The humidity in the air was oppressive as were the bugs buzzing around their heads. Alec smelled lots of new smells, some sharp, some dull and some seemed to make his stomach growl.<br />
&quot;We rest here. Tomorrow, we enter the swamp and finish this.&quot; Vivian said, she sounded winded to Alec. <br />
She pointed to a patch of dry land. There were still remains of a previous camp on it. &quot;That&#39;s our stop.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re going to be okay?&quot; Alec&#39;s ears twitched as a musquito flew by his sensitive ears.<br />
&quot;Stop worrying about me and start thinking about how you&#39;re going to help in this body.&quot; She snapped the musquito out of the air. <br />
Alec made his way to the dry patch and felt relieved as his paws felt more solid ground. <br />
&quot;I thought you had a plan.&quot; Alec stood ready as Vivian undid the ropes. She dropped the packs on the dry land with a slightly soggy thud. She then carefully removed Alec&#39;s old body.<br />
&quot;I do have a plan, but in case you haven&#39;t noticed there&#39;s stuff happening to me and if my plan fails then having a back up seems like a good idea wouldn&#39;t you think?&quot; She sat down in the grass. &quot;God, my back is killing me.&quot;<br />
He briefly considered taking over her body, he was curious how she felt. But now was definetely not the time for that. &quot;So what is your plan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Basically, we go in. You distract her, I shoot her.&quot;<br />
A feeling of great unease welled up inside Alec, there were so many problems with her &#39;plan&#39;. First and foremost though. &quot;That&#39;s not a plan! Also, shoot her? With what, the breeze? You don&#39;t have a bow!&quot;<br />
Vivian held up her hands showing her archery guards. She tapped the insides of her wrists together. The gem on the inside seemed to come alive, a soft humming filled the air as the vines that decorated it lit up and coiled off the braces and into the air. The writhed and twisted until a small bow was formed. &quot;With this.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s awesome.&quot; he purred. The bow was remarkebly short for a bow, but perfect for her current length and probably good for in a forest. <br />
&quot;Hey wait a minute, you&#39;re not carrying any arrows.&quot;<br />
She made a drawing motion, moving her hand from the her wrist down. The vines on her gloves sprang to life again and coiled around eachother and into her hand forming a solid green arrow.<br />
&quot;So what do those things cost and what can I do to get some?&quot;<br />
&quot;About a small country and nothing. These are family heirlooms, there&#39;s apparently some Elven ancestry in my family.&quot; The bow and arrow turned brown and withered on her arm before falling away into dust. &quot;I can shoot her, if we get the chance. We just have to sneak up. I also considered you could take her body and then I shoot her while you hold her still.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do that! I to..&quot; <br />
She cut him off, &quot;I know. We didn&#39;t use it earlier on the Nekomata, so we&#39;re not doing it here either. You told me you need to repossess your own body and I imagine that repossessing something might be difficult if I kill her with you in her. It was my original plan though, but maybe we can keep it as plan Z.&quot; She smiled wryly. &quot;You don&#39;t mind taking an arrow for me do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;This is no time to joke!&quot;<br />
&quot;Then start planning.&quot;<br />
<br />
At dinner Vivian put some raw meat before Alec. <br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; It smelled good though.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a predator, they don&#39;t cook. You can try some of mine if you want to be certain.&quot; She offered a piece of cooked meat in her hands.<br />
He took the bit. Tasteless, dry. He forced himself to swallow. It was disgusting.<br />
He eyed the slab of meat before him. His human mind kept telling him not to do this, but he tore a piece from the raw meat with his sharp teeth. The taste was infinitely better. Moist and tender, he could taste the juices flowing down his throat.<br />
&quot;See.&quot; Vivian sat down with her plate. As she ate he noticed Vivian seemed to be eating differently, she made careful movements not to brush her swollen lips.<br />
Later in the evening Alec lay under the blanket trying to catch some sleep. But he was also trying to think up different plans, unfortunately he&#39;d never been in a magical swamp as a cat woman before so he had no idea what to expect. <br />
All the practice sessions with Vivian weren&#39;t going to help him now if he went in as a Nekomata. But he was much faster and stronger than in his human body, so maybe this could work out. The thought of stalking the witch made him excited. He felt his blood pumping through his body.<br />
He shuddered, was he really going to take another life? He wondered what the witch looked like. Maybe she was covered in warts, or maybe she was a hot babe. Could he kill a hot babe? For that matter, could he kill?<br />
He obviously never killed in his previous life. He felt a cold shiver just thinking about it. Could he do it? She would just revive, so it wasn&#39;t really a permanent killing. Yet somehow that didn&#39;t make him feel better.<br />
Things were quiet and for a moment he just listened to Vivian&#39;s breathing and the animals slithering around the swamp. Her breathing was a nice and rhythmic sound. In...out...in...out. He heard her clothes rustle as she change position.<br />
In..out..in..out. Her breathing seemed to speed up though. In.out.in.out. He lay motionlessly. She was breathing faster still. Did she just moan? He smelled the air. A familiar smell mixed into the smells from the swamp.<br />
Was she masturbating? <br />
He listened closer. Her breathing was fast and shallow. He heard her clothes rustle. He wanted to see this, but could he turn around without her knowing he was awake. Actually, what would happen if she did? Images of him making out with those fat lips, while his fingers probed her vagina and she did the same to him flashed through his mind.<br />
He felt his own pussy heat up and moisten. <br />
He heard more shuffling and another stifled moan escaped.<br />
Fuck it, he had to see this. He slowly turned with his eyes closed. The breathing and rustling stopped briefly. He pulled his blanket closer to his face and sighed, pretending to be in deep sleep. Silence followed, nothing to be heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmmmm.&quot; He heard the fast short breaths resume and opened an eye as narrowly as he could. His cat&#39;s eyes allowed him to see Vivian nearly as clear as day. She was on all fours, her heavy breasts rubbing the ground below her as her hand worked her pussy.<br />
He slowly opened his other eye, was she sucking on something. His legs and vagina clenched. Maybe he should &#39;wake up&#39; and join her? His body didn&#39;t really seem to want to do that, even if he thought it was hot. He felt a shiver run through his body, his paw was stroking his mound between his legs. When did he start that? It was warm to the touch, less sensitive than Vivian or Amber though. But it still felt so good.<br />
He slipped a padded finger in, he shivered and gasped. He stayed silent, Vivian&#39;s breathing continued. Her moans had gotten louder. Alec brought his hand further between his furry legs and slipped his finger in his moist slit. He rubbed and massaged. Until he felt the pressure building. His breathing sped up, he could feel it.<br />
He rubbed harder and faster, while still looking at Vivian working her own pussy. He imagined himself fucking her from behind, he could feel her sucking his dick with those fat lips. His body tensed up and released. Shivering silently he came and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Vivian woke him up the following morning, her hand on his shoulder he could feel a heavy breast resting on his arm. &quot;Time to kill a witch.&quot;<br />
He turned. She&#39;d changed further again. She seemed shorter once more. Her nose has changed back into a pigs snout. Thick large nipples were clearly visible through the fabric of her clothes.<br />
He shot up. &quot;Okay, you don&#39;t look like you have much time left.&quot;<br />
Vivian got up to her full length. Her breasts had remained the same size, but looked bigger still on her dimutive frame. She was just above belly button height now. Alec sat crouched and looked at her. &quot;Are you sure you can do this?&quot;<br />
She snorted and tilted her head as he eyes looked at his crotch briefly, before looking up. &quot;Yes.&quot; She replied as she struggled to tie her bra on tighter.<br />
Could she smell what he&#39;d done yesterday?<br />
She turned to pick up her stuff, a small pigstail had finished growing just at the end of her spine.</p>
