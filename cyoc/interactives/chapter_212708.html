<br />
Chad squashed another mosquito. As the day grew hotter the mosquitos only seemed to be getting more intense. Chad grumbled. Not only was he changing, but he also had to endure these interminable mosquitos. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! I almost forgot. The tauropaste!&quot; Turning from Chad, he scampered over to the piece of bark he&#39;d made the paste on.<br />
<br />
Picking it up, he rushed over to Chad. &quot;This&#39;ll stop those mosquitos!&quot; His voice was colored with apparent pride. <br />
<br />
Rob recalled his recent lesson with the Tribe&#39;s medicine man. He was apprenticed to succeed him when the time came, but he had a lot to learn. Tauropaste was a simple herbal concoction that was often seen as the perfect lesson to teach beginners the art of healing. A quick mind, Rob had quickly grasped the technique. Today, he finally had a chance to apply his new skill. <br />
<br />
Rob paused. That wasn&#39;t right. Shaking his head, he tried to clear the memory away...but it just lingered. He *knew* he never learned that, yet the memory was just as vivid as his memories of last weeks ball game against the Tigers. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay dude?&quot; Chad asked, his voice cracking higher midsentence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yea...I&#39;m find dude. This shitty jungle...its just fucking with me bro...&quot; Even that sentence felt weird. The bro-like vocabulary his own, yet almost not his own...unnatural to a jungle boy.<br />
<br />
Chad was unsure what was happening in the mind of the visibly dazed Rob. A buzzing filled his ears. Another damn mosquito. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! Rob! Snap out of it...the paste!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...yea..sorry I was distracted....your mosquito problem...&quot;  Without thinking rob dipped his hands into the paste, . His teacher had taught him the correct method of applying the ointment. Gentle circular strokes against the skin were necessary to coax the leafy oils into the oil-resistant skin. Too much rubbing, however, would disturb the chemistry of the oils, breaking their mosquito repelling bonds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Give me your arm, I&#39;ll rub it in &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude. Don&#39;t be fucking gay. I may look like a kid, but I&#39;m a fucking adult. I can do it myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No...just...trust me, there&#39;s a trick to applying this stuff. It&#39;s, uh, hard to explain...&quot; Rob once again tried to juggle the competing throughts and knowledge in his mind. &quot;I don&#39;t know why I know...but I just know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad looked into Rob&#39;s eyes, confused and slightly worried by the words of his changing friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad relented, holding out his arm. <br />
<br />
As Rob began to knead the paste into his skin he felt a brief moment of tension, unused to both such an intimate touch from another man...er boy rather... but also his friend being so gentle. It was completely unlike the bulldozer-of-the-gridiron Rob he knew. <br />
<br />
As the rubbing continued, that tension melted into comfort. He shivered slightly and couldn&#39;t help but start to melt into Rob&#39;s practiced, massaging hands. <br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be a good medicine man someday...&quot; He thought idly. <br />
<br />
As Rob spread the paste over his friend, neither noticed as Chad&#39;s form shortened ever so slightly, and his midrif just barely pinch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to do your back now&quot; Rob whispered into Chad&#39;s ear. A slight tingle passed down his spine in anticipation. <br />
<br />
Both boys lost themselves into the massage as Rob worked Chads Back. Sitting cross-legged, Chad was completely at ease. There was, however, something odd. He was feeling a bit...off. He shifted his legs slightly, as part of his subconscious sensed something different in the lower half of his body. <br />
<br />
Without a word, Rob parted Chad&#39;s long hair and began to rub the paste into his neck. As he worked, part of him realized something wrong about chads hair. &quot;Was it always this long?&quot; He thought <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now for your chest&quot; Rob said, as he plopped down in front of Chad. The two face to face. <br />
<br />
Tenderly, Rob pressed his hands against Chad&#39;s stomach, causing the other boy to shiver. The stomach was much more tender than his back. <br />
Every now and then, the two would find themselves locking eyes and sharing a small grin. Both felt a slight heat in their faces.  Chad was enjoying this, and Rob was enjoying Chad&#39;s enjoyment. Chad shifted his legs again, pressing them together slightly. He felt a mellow pleasure as he did.<br />
<br />
Soon, Rob worked up to Chad&#39;s chest. As he kneaded the flesh, he couldn&#39;t help but note Chad had ever so slightly more fat there than normal. His chest was.... slightly fuller. The heat in Rob&#39;s face grew slightly as he too squirmed his legs, pressing them together slightly in uncertain energy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm&quot; Chad moaned slightly, not noticing the pitch of his voice had raised once more. Leaning his head back, he closed his eyes and enjoyed the feel as his long hair cascaded down his back. For some reason Rob&#39;s hands on his chest just felt amazing. Small firecrackers of sensation burst from them, traveling down his spine and oddly....between his legs. He lightly squeezed his legs together again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Done&quot; Rob said, sitting back. <br />
<br />
Chad opened his eyes. And the two shared a long stare. Rob smirked slightly; uncertain emotions mixed with a sense of pride at his work. Silence filled the air as mosquitos buzzed about, newly deterred. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very good at that&quot; Chad said, breaking the silence <br />
<br />
Rob blushed slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. You have the perfect body to try my new skills on&quot; he said, staring into Chad&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Rob gently rested his hand on Chads. Silence once again filled the air.<br />
<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
&quot;THE FUCK?!&quot;</p>
