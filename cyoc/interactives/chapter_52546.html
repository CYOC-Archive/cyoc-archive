<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felix began stripping his clothes off, hanging them on the hooks of the dressing room. He even stripped off his boxers, since he was all alone in the room. Though he didn't like staring at a model-like figure with a small penis. He let out a low sigh. Probably thinking about all the effort he put into himself to compensate for his small manhood. He pulled up the swim briefs and stretched them out to where they should be if it were on the right man. Then he let go... But the swim briefs didn't fall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gravity must be taking a small break...&quot; Felix joked, figuring it was an elaborate trick or something. In all his 20 years of living, he had never seen such a wacky trick.<br />
<br />
Felix tried to pull down the swim briefs, but they just stayed there, which really made him panic. As he struggled to pull them down, he started feeling hot around where the swim briefs were (or should be) covering. Felix just wanted it all to stop, though the prickly warmth he felt down there was strangely euphoric. His waist and glutes had begun expanding to fit the Speedo in the blink of an eye. Before he could even draw another breath, the sensation spread south, gliding over his legs and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh fuh-uh-ck!&quot; Felix moaned, getting frustrated. In his mind he was beyond scared, but the pleasuring sensation wouldn't let him yell for help.<br />
<br />
As the sensation fully enveloped his legs, they began feeling weak and unstable. Felix had to lean against the mirror in order to stop himself from falling. He watched as his toned legs began getting meatier. His feet followed suit and began growing larger to support these muscular tree trunks he now called his legs. He was not extremely disproportionate, which made him worry even more. Though his anxiety was dulled as the warmth began moving upward, spreading over his entire torso.<br />
<br />
First up was his abdomen, which grew longer, making his perfect six pack stretch a bit. Then each separate ab muscle began growing larger in all directions, filling out all the awkward space left behind from the length increase. His pecs began swelling to enormous proportions, something he had only seen on the beefiest of men. Now his body was so heavy that he could no longer lean against the wall with his puny arms. He pulled back, surprised that he could stand. He looked himself over in the mirror, seeing the massive and impressive gains. He then locked in on his arms, noticing the sensation was moving up his shoulders<br />
<br />
Felix watched his arms and hands pulsate as the warmth spread over them. His hands inflated to cartoonish proportions before thinning down into hands appropriate for a man his size. As for his arms, they just kept pulsating - growing in size with each wave. They grew thicker, harder, longer - just like the rest of his body. Finally... The sensation moved down south. This Speedo was his size, for the most part. However, there was one thing left. When the warmth reached it's final destination, Felix couldn't control himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-my d-aaaaaaah.&quot; Felix yelled, his voice being a few pitches lower than before, his face flushing red. His cock began swelling to fit the front of the Speedo. It was flaccid, but it slowly lengthened, the sensation making Felix back up against the wall before slowly sliding down. 4 inches... 5 inches... 6 inches... 7 inches... Flaccid. After that, a swelling of his testicles occurred to match his equipment. His testicles grew to the size of lemons, making them able to produce enough testosterone for his new body and an unfathomable amount of sperm for Felix's sexual needs. After that, the warmth spread out all over before fading away. Felix felt like the entire experience was like a constant orgasm that kept intensifying... It was amazing, and he was a bit disappointed that it all stopped, yet he was glad he had control over himself now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was... Insane!&quot; Felix exclaimed, pushing his hair back. &quot;I can't believe this... At all... But... Why do I feel so tired...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix yawned, trying to keep his eyes open. He wanted to stay awake and deal with whatever just happened, but his new body wouldn't let him. Instead of fighting it, he let his eyes drift shut for just a few moments before snapping back awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck! Where am I?&quot; Felix asked himself as he shot up to his feet. &quot;Oh right... The dressing room. Damn, I should have had more coffee! I almost passed out.<br />
<br />
He took a look in the mirror, and he acted as if he had always been that way. What looked back was a confident man that stood at 6'4&quot; tall and weighed about 300 pounds in solid muscle. Not a single follicle of body-hair or ounce of fat was visible on this man's stunning visage. It was Felix; the epitome of clean-shaven virility, well, more like the God of Virility thanks to his impressive stature. Though he was still the same Felix on the inside, just with a slightly adjusted memory. For example, the whole reason for getting the Speedo was to get over his crippling shyness and image-complex. He didn't have any issue showing off, but when he received compliments, he'd go from macho-man to shy-guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey buddy, you left your clothes out here!&quot; A man said, knocking on the changing room's door. He stepped back, allowing room for Felix to walk out. &quot;Oh wow, you look more amazing than I thought you would... In that Speedo, I mean!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-heh, thanks?&quot; Felix awkwardly replied as he took the duffel bag. &quot;You sure picked out a winner for me. It's pretty hard to find one that fits me because of the front part... Er, I forgot why I came here, though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You came here for a pair of swim briefs and clothes. At least, that's what you told me.&quot; The man stated with a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. You said all you had were dinky rags for clothes because they got contaminated with bad fungus spores or something. You only have a few pairs of wearable clothes in your duffel bag. Your shoes and socks are in the bag, but your sandals are over there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn, you're right! I guess I'll be stopping by here later.&quot; Felix said, as he went to put the sandals on his feet. &quot;But first, I want to hit the beach before eleven o'clock so I can get a good spot. What's the price for this Speedo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you look so good in it, I think I'll just give it away. But the rest of the clothes you want will have to be bought with cash.&quot; The man said, giving Felix a pat on the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you say so, I'm not going to argue.&quot; He hurriedly replied, finding his face grow a bit warm. &quot;Thanks for the Speedo then, see ya later!&quot;</p>
