<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With each push of your hips you become more and more lost in your senses.  The feel of Kate&#39;s smooth flesh against yours, the smell of her sweat, the sound of her whimpers and moans, the sight of her lost in her own bliss, the gentle caress of the goddess&#39;s hands as she teases your animal features, and above all, the feel of Kate&#39;s enhanced vagina as you thrust into it.  It offers the perfect amount of resistance with each push, and she flexes it to squeeze your cock in appreciation as you pull it back.  Any considerations of the consequences are cast aside as you pump harder and faster.  The pleasure wells up within you and you can&#39;t take it anymore.  Your whole body is hot, and you can both feel and hear your heartbeat in your ears.  You can&#39;t hold in the moans as you breath heavily, and as you buck your hips, you and Kate let loose the primal verbalizations of your passion in unison.  You feel yourself pass the point of no return, and a pressure builds in your crotch.  With a final thrust, you unload with yell.  Kate&#39;s whole body tenses up against you, echoing your shout of elation as she shudders in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
You collapse into each other&#39;s embrace as the rapture of your orgasm passes over both of you.  Lascivia&#39;s hands retreat to rest in her lap or shrink back into her torso, and she watches in silent anticipation.  Your pelvises continue twitching and spasming intermittently as the aftershocks take you both.  However, you don&#39;t feel the pleasure waning into the afterglow that you expect.  Instead, it seems to concentrate into a intense tingling sensation in your crotch.  You lift yourself and glance down in curiosity to see both Kate&#39;s and your genitals deform and sink into each other, creating a flesh-colored, latex bridge between you.  You try to pull back in shock, but find yourself only just able to sit up onto your knees with your calves beneath you.  Your rubbery flesh resists any attempts to retreat further.<br />
<br />
The tingling spreads slowly throughout your body before centering in your head, arms and legs.  It continues concentrating into your face, then just your trunk, ears, hands, and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I feel weird,&quot; Kate says in a dreamy tone, as she runs her left hoof along the edge of her ear.  You notice her nose begin to swell.  She continues examining her ear as it begins to do likewise.  Your hands start to feel numb.  You hold them out to examine them, palms up, not seeing any obvious cause for the sensation.  You try to close and open them experimentally, and they feel sluggish and stiff, taking much longer to move than you expect.  As you inspect your hands, your palms begin to look like they&#39;re bulging out.  You peer closer and notice that your fingers also seem to be shrinking down into your hands.  You get a vague hint of a worry at the back of your mind that something is wrong, but the cloud of arousal still hanging over your brain makes it hard to focus clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...?  What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot;  you hear Kate exclaim.  You look back to her face to see her looking cross-eyed at her nose as it expands out from her face.  She lifts her other hoof up to prod at it.  It appears different than you remember, the color not quite as pure white as it used to be, blending closer to the color of the rest of her skin.  The shape is off as well, with five nubs extending from it, about at the points where you would expect...<br />
<br />
You look back at your hands.  They&#39;re distinctly paler.  Your drugged brain begins to piece together what&#39;s happening, and you reach up to your trunk to find empty air where you expect the tip to be.  As you focus on it, you feel it sliding up your torso as it withdraws back into your face.  You tilt your head from side to side, shocked by the absence of your earlobes brushing your shoulders as you&#39;ve started to become accustomed to.  You turn to your side and look down at your right foot to find a pale lump a the base of your ankle with a few bumps extending from the end.  You look back up to  Kate in curiosity.<br />
<br />
She gazes down in morbid fascination as a slightly pudgy hand runs up and down the length of her trunk while its expansion begins to slow.  She shudders in what seems to be a mixture of disturbance and pleasure as her new proboscis becomes more and more sensitive, surely intensified by the overwhelming tingles that still course through the pair of you.  Her mouth opens and closes as if to say something, but no words come out.<br />
<br />
You look down yourself.  In the middle of your face sits a very human nose, though not quite the shape you remember.  You reach your right hand up to touch it, and are startled by the white latex hoof that enters your vision instead.  You quickly pull the other up to inspect them both, astonished at the alien sight on the end of your wrists.  You try to flex your fingers to no avail.  All fine motors seem to have been lost from your new mitts.  You squeeze them together, feeling the latex in each slightly deform from the pressure.  You rub them against each other, producing rubbery squeaks, and the explosion of sensations makes you gasp.  These are way more sensitive than the transformed features that you just previously possessed.  Perhaps it&#39;s because they&#39;re entirely latex, where you old bits were mostly still flesh?<br />
<br />
You reach a hoof back up to your ears.  They&#39;re less dexterous than hands, so you can only make a rough approximation.  But as far as you can tell, your ears are now more or less normal-sized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; You ask Kate as you look back to see how she&#39;s faring.   She looks down in silence at her hands as she opens and closes them in fascination.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess so,&quot; she answers.  The tension in your crotch subsides and your mind begins to clear.  You move to stand up and offer a hoof out to her to help her up with you.  She takes it and hauls herself to her feet, before she moves her hands back to feeling along the width of her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human, tell me honestly: do I look like a freak?&quot; Kate asks while looking to the ground, audibly choking back tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that&#39;s not my real name?&quot; You almost ask, before offering encouragement.  &quot;It&#39;s not that bad.  Really.  On <i>you,</i> it all just looks kind of cute, honestly,&quot; you say reassuringly.  As you keep looking at her, you realize you aren&#39;t even lying, really.  Even with the bizarre features, her feminine beauty still shines through, and she looks more exotic than grotesque.<br />
<br />
She presses her lips together into a not-quite-smile and says, &quot;Even if you don&#39;t mean it, I really appreciate it,&quot; her tear-glossed eyes looking up to meet yours.  Before you can assure her, another voice interrupts you.<br />
<br />
&quot;My my, wasn&#39;t that quite the treat,&quot; Lascivia cooed as she stood up and strode closer to look down at you in approval.  &quot;The way you just seized one another and took exactly what you wanted, climaxing in unison, offering your essence up to each other in gratitude.  You&#39;re getting me all hot and bothered,&quot; she giggled, reaching her arms out to pat each of your heads in praise.  &quot;Well, I suppose you earned these back.&quot;  Her arms move lower, stretching subtly to reach both of your crotches.  Her hand deforms into liquid latex, completely encompassing your nethers once more.  The sensations are sharp and erogenous as she works once again to change you.  It&#39;s only a few seconds before her limbs move back, and you peer down to find your normal, flesh and blood genitalia residing on you again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I considering reversing you, you know?&quot; she purred.  &quot;Letting you experience each other&#39;s most intimate parts, exploring a whole new world of sensation.  But I supposed you&#39;re already getting to walk a mile in each others&#39; shoes, so to say.  So for now, I&#39;ll leave you with a single boon of empathy.  If we had more time, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s so much more fun we could have together.  But for now, I&#39;m all worked up and desire a fresh outlet for my lust, and I believe I sense a new toy nearby.  They&#39;re in for quite the treat,&quot;  said with a sultry laugh.  Her movements suddenly shifted from their lithe, seductive ease to being quick and direct as she readied and lowered herself.  She took a pose somewhere between a sprinter toeing the line and a predator about to pounce on its prey.  She turned back towards you to meet your eyes one last time and said, &quot;Try to be careful out there.  I hope to be seeing you soon, in some form or another,&quot; laughing and blowing you a kiss.  Her eyes then opened wide as she turned and seemed to focus on something off in the distance.  Her face split into a wide grin, and she suddenly bounded off into the shadows with absolutely inhuman speed.<br />
<br />
You and Kate watched her back as it disappeared into the thicket, leaving the two of you naked in stunned silence broken only by the buzzing streetlamp beaming above.  After taking a few moments to gather yourselves, the quiet was broken by Kate declaring, &quot;I can&#39;t go on like this; I&#39;m at my limit.  It has to be almost 3 a.m.  I need to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, but where?  We&#39;re still in the middle of hostile territory, and we&#39;re now completely exposed to the elements.  Even if we find a good hiding spot to sleep, we can&#39;t be sure that one of those things won&#39;t sense us like she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Kate answered, &quot;now that we&#39;re on the path, I think I know where we are.  I jog through this forest every evening, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, we can&#39;t be more than a half mile from my apartment.  If we&#39;re careful, I think we can make it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you weigh your options until...</p>
