<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John couldn&#39;t believe how good he felt. Not only did his body feel amazing, but he could see the occasional glance shoot towards him. Confidence that he hadn&#39;t had in years flowed through him. He had only gone to the hardware store to pick up a spark plug, but ended up walking around a little more than usual. All because of that little device.<br />
<br />
It was strange feeling  that much power in his fingertips, yet a bit exhilarating as well. He almost wanted to change more. With the Chronivac in his hands, he hovered his fingers over the keypad, wondering what he might want to change. There were so many possibilities, that it was just too hard to think of any. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need some help, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
John nearly jumped as he&#39;d been approached by an older employee. He was a bit surprised as usually went he went to a hard ware store like this, it would take him forever to even see someone working there. But to actually be approached, that was almost a tale of legend that he&#39;d have to pass on to the other guys. &quot;Actually,&quot; John smiled. &quot;I think you can.&quot; He pulled out the device and opened up the screen, looking at it as though it was some kind of list. &quot;Just give me one second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time,&quot; the employee said. Hank, as the nametag said, was an older man. Most likely in his late 50&#39;s or early 60&#39;s. His white hair was sparse on top of his head, while his body had gained all sorts of fat over the years. Obviously there came a point where working out and keeping abs was important, but this man probably never really cared. However, that didn&#39;t mean he was slacking. Years and years of hard manual labor had still given him a strong undercoat, but at the same time, an unhealthy diet of fast food and soda never let him see any of the real benefits from it. Most people would just call him fat. Not noticing just how much muscle and strength was built in those massive hands and strong forearms. <br />
<br />
However, with the Chronivac, he&#39;d be able to make it so other people could see that as well. And then test out a few other features as well. Part of John was really curious as to just how powerful this thing could actually be. Judging on what it did to him, it had to be pretty amazing. But he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what other people would think. No one noticed his transformation, so would they notice someone else&#39;s? He quickly typed in, &#39;Hank is a young upstarting bodybuilder with all the strength he&#39;d built over the years. However, this time he focuses on being healthy as well.&#39; John was about to hit enter when a more devious thought entered into his mind. He played with it for a second but then went through with typing it in. &#39;Shirts are optional at his workplace.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; John looked up from his phone, a bit worried. However, Hank didn&#39;t seem any different. Not in personality wise. Just that he scratched at his hair. The thinning white remains started to grow out, turning brown as they did so. &quot;I&#39;m looking for a spark plug. Just can&#39;t seem to find the right aisle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s aisle 12,&quot; Hank said. The rasp in his voice from age wasn&#39;t as noticeable. Nor were the wrinkles around his eyes or face. His skin was slowly starting to smooth over, looking less ragged and a bit more vibrant. &quot;Right this way.&quot; He started walking towards the end of the aisle. Each step filled with just a bit more confidence. But at the same time with his belly pulling back into him, each step was far less of a waddle. His muscular legs filled his blue jeans, easily showing off their strength. The tough denim molded around the muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... How long have you worked here?&quot; John asked. He wanted to make a bit of small talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been...&quot; Hank cut himself off. He was about to answer, but then confusion struck him. He&#39;d tilted his head slightly as the answer he was about to give didn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;d been almost twenty-five years since he started. But based off the his face, he barely looked to be forty. And then that would have meant he started when he was fifteen. Hank shook his head trying to figure out the right answer as the two realities intertwined. With each passing second there seemed to be another year gone, making his original answer all the more ridiculous.<br />
<br />
He pulled at the collar of his shirt. His thick neck filling the large shirt completely while his large burly arms did the same. Thick veins bulged from his arms, pumping blood through them. Any fat on them seemed to disappear as strong muscle quickly replaced what had been there. It was getting harder think of him as anything but strong. &quot;It&#39;s been a while,&quot; Hank finally said. Confidence still filled his voice, yet it wasn&#39;t nearly as old sounding. <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; John smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here are the spark plugs, Coach. Which kind did you need?&quot; Hank asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; John tilted his head at the sudden change in formality. Hank barely looked to be 25. His face was young but with a strong jaw covered in deep brown trimmed beard. It only accentuated his masculine face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s ones for your car, lawn mower, or whatever. But depending on the machine, you need to get the right one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; John tried to play it off. Memories of Hank in the locker room started to fill his mind. But he&#39;d never known this guy before today. Now it almost felt like they had some kind of report. He could remember Hank talking about wanting to go into bodybuilding. Wanting to get as big and strong as possible. And based off what he looked like that wasn&#39;t too far off. Hank&#39;s body filled his clothes, almost to bursting. His massive muscles easily seen, despite being covered. &quot;Lawn mower,&quot; John finally said.<br />
<br />
Hank leaned over. His shirt stretched around his arms, while his perfect round butt stuck out. &quot;Lawn mower... Lawn mower... Lawn mower...&quot; he said over and over again, before picking up the right one and handing it to John. &quot;Here you go,&quot; he smiled. Then one of his hands tugged at his collar. It looked like it was almost strangling him. He tried to play it off, but there was a clear discomfort on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy question, but doesn&#39;t this store not require you to wear a shirt? You know, only if you don&#39;t want to?&quot; John asked. <br />
<br />
A wry smile filled the young man&#39;s face. &quot;It does. But a lot of the guys get a little jealous whenever I do... So, I kind of just grin and bear it you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... Guess so,&quot; John smiled back. &quot;But I don&#39;t think you should really worry about it.&quot; He pulled out the Chronivac again. &#39;No one Hank works with is jealous. They&#39;re just inspired by his dedication and try to emulate it instead.&#39; John turned back and gave the other man a wave. &quot;Thanks for the help bud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank was already removing the shirt he was wearing. A bit of sweat was running down his body. The bright lights bounced off it, giving him a noticeable shine. &quot;No problem coach,&quot; Hank waved back.<br />
<br />
John walked to the front counter and started checking out. He was surprised to see just how many of the male employees were taking the optional shirt rule to heart. But more surprising was just how many of them looked far more fit than usual. Some of them still had bellies covered in fur, but their arms, chest and legs were clearly more built instead of looking fat.</p>
