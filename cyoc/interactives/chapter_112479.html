<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A boy named Kyle walked into the so called magic shop and started digging around. There wasn&#39;t many people in the shop at the time, the only people were him the woman at the register and another older woman looking at some of the items.<br />
<br />
The item were very weird, some said they could change you into animals, some said they would give you a wish and so on. Kyle wasn&#39;t that interested until he saw an item that said &quot;Age Progesion&quot;. It was very interesting so Kyle bought it just for the fun of it because it was very cheap and he didn&#39;t expect it to work.<br />
<br />
Kyle got home and he was home alone because his dad had gone on a trip and his mum was at work for another four hours. Kyle went straight to his room and opened the box that the age Progesion device was in. He took the device out and it was a cube with a load of buttons on top but luckily there was a piece of paper at the bottom of the box with instructions. There was a dial with numbers on it that went from 01-99, the instructions said that the number you put the dial to, that is age age you will become. Once that was done, all you had to do was press the yellow button and you would become that age. To go back to normal all you had to do was press the red button.<br />
<br />
Before he set the though he thought to himself that if it REALLY works then he would rip his clothes so he took of all his clothes until he was only in his boxers.<br />
<br />
Kyle was thirteen so he decided to set the machine to twenty-eight and he pressed the yellow button. Nothing happened at first but then the machine shot a yellow wave of energy a kyles forehead. After that he started feeling funny, he realised that his legs were getting bigger and more muscular, then they felt a bit tingly as they got coved in hair. His feet also felt much bigger aswel. Then his ass got bigger and sexy aswel. After that he knew it was coming, his defining masculine trait. His penis slowly grew larger and larger until Kyle had a huge bulge in his boxers. His testicals followed suit as they to got larger too. Then, all around his genitals, he grew more pubic hair. He was already starting to feel really manly. His boxer were feeling tighter than normal though but he could put up with it for now. Next kyles stomach stretched out some with his chest making him even taller. Then his chest got bigger and broader which felt amazing. His arm next start to grow starting with his shoulders gets broader and then the rest of his arm getting longer and muscular. His hands also grew to a very manly size. Then just as he got with his legs, his chest and arms started to feel tingly as hair grew on them. Chest hair grew to a large amount that any woman would die be with a man with that quantity, not to little and not too much. He didn&#39;t grow too much hair on his arms but he wasn&#39;t that bothered about it. Then for the last thing, his face altered to give of a more masculine, adult like look. Kyle thought that was all but he got one more tingly sensation in his face. He slowly grew out a thick, sexy, luxurious full beard.<br />
<br />
The machine then beeped which he assumed, meant that the transformation was complete. Kyle was marvelled at his new body. He rubbed his chest hair and it felt so nice and relaxing, and he did the same with his leg hair. (Remember, Kyle is a thirteen year old that has never experienced this kind of thing before). Then he moved to his beard which felt just as nice and soothing. <br />
<br />
He realised then he haven&#39;t seen his penis yet. He pulled down his boxers, since they were to tight to just stretch open, and once again his new body had marvelled him as he looked down at his huge penis and testicals. <br />
<br />
His new body was perfect.<br />
<br />
Part 2 coming soon, it will be &quot;from a boy to a man part 2&quot;</p>
