<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff sighed, rubbing his eyes as he made his way back to Chemistry. The entire situation with Alicia was still a work in progress. Although she had gone from a pregnant teenager to a pregnant woman, their were still issues that needed to be worked out. She deserved someone, that much Jeff knew. Whether it would be him or not was up for debate. <br />
<br />
Reentering class, Jeff now took his seat, a dull expression on his face as he listened to Mrs. Kowalski. Before Jeff had gotten the Chronovac, Mrs. Kowalski had been one of the better members of the teaching staff. At 56, she was also one of the younger teachers at the school, which wasn&#39;t saying much considering the median age of Jeffs teachers was over 60. Now though, Jeff found it difficult to get through class. He wanted to talk with someone. Carefully taking out his phone, Jeff now scanned Mrs. Kowalski.<br />
<br />
Name: Jillian Kowalski <br />
Age: 56<br />
Mental Age: 56<br />
Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: 140lbs <br />
Build: Medium<br />
Gender: female<br />
<br />
Jeff rubbed his chin, Mrs. Kowalski had always been a very level headed woman. Always willing to listen to her students. Maybe she could help Jeff out with his problems. Jeff now punched in the changes to Mrs. Kowalski, studying her stats carefully.<br />
<br />
Name: Jillian Kowalski <br />
Age: 16<br />
Mental Age: 16<br />
Relationships: Jeff Davis (close friend, lab partner)<br />
Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: Auto<br />
Alter reality: Auto <br />
Alter clothing: Auto<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, it seemed like he and Jillian would be able to talk. Hopefully she could help him figure out what he wanted to do. Taking a breath, Jeff now activated the Chronovac as he now watched the changes to Mrs. Kowalski.<br />
<br />
Jillian Kowalski, was an attractive looking woman, sporting a medium build with C cup breasts and shoulder length dirty blonde hair. Jeff noted lines around the corner of her mouth and eyes as well as some greys intermingled amongst her hair making it appear dull. Dressed in business slacks with flats and a short sleeved blouse, Jeff thought that for a woman in her 50s she was in pretty good shape.<br />
<br />
Now though, time was reversing itself. Jeff noting the lines around her eyes and mouth vanishing, her skin tone beginning to even. By the time she reached 40, Jeff noticed the greys had mostly vanished, her face unlined and her hazel eyes seeming a bit brighter. The loss of over a decade of age making her appear more energetic. <br />
<br />
Jillian clothing though remained unchanged as she traveled back through her 30s. Jeff watching her skin smoothing as the grey vanished. Jillian hair appeared to lengthen slightly, brushing past her shoulders. The now 30 year old paused in her lesson, tying her hair back as she continued. Jeff nodded in approval of his now 30 year old teacher. Jillian seemed to project an aura of warmth, her voice gentle if somewhat nervous. It appeared she was uncomfortable with public speaking but had gained enough confidence to teach her lessons admirably.<br />
<br />
That confidence was slowly being stripped away as she descended through her 20s. Jeff watching as Jillian&#39;s clothing now shifted, becoming more professional in appearance. Gazing at the woman, Jeff was struck by her appearance, dressed in freshly pressed business slacks and a plain looking blouse, she looked as if she would be more comfortable in a board room as opposed to a classroom. Jillian&#39;s body language also began to shift, she sounded more nervous, her posture stiff as if she was petrified of making a mistake. Oddly enough it struck Jeff as adorable, the now 25 year old appearing quite awkward in her demeanor.<br />
<br />
For Jeff he couldn&#39;t quite understand why. Jillian was quite pretty, possessing perky C cup breasts, slight curves, and a flat stomach. The young woman&#39;s face had a certain softness to it, being slightly round with large hazel eyes. It seemed though she was uncomfortable with her appearance, her blouse a little large and obscuring her breasts. <br />
<br />
Now Jillian had hit her student teaching days, the young woman nervously glancing around the classroom. It appeared she was almost painfully shy, brushing stray strands of dirty blond hair from her face. Those days though passed quickly, Jillian once more returning to college. Now dressed in a Hoodie and jeans, she gave the students a shy smile as she now moved away from the teachers desk.<br />
<br />
Jeff now watched Jillian skip back through college, the girls face rounding slightly, her breasts losing some of their fullness. As she reached her teens Jeff gazed at an awkwardly cute girl with long dirty blonde hair. Jillian now tied it into a ponytail as she began to walk towards Jeff.<br />
<br />
Each step now brought her closer to Jeffs age, the girls figure slimming, her breasts losing a cup size, and her clothing changing once again. By the time she sat down next to Jeff, she was a cute 16 year old girl dressed in a baggy long sleeved     t-shirt, jeans, and canvas sneakers. Sitting down, she blinked at Jeff before offering him a shy smile. &quot;Hey Jeff,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Did you finish the assignment from last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, his memories cementing as he looked at Jillian. Jillian was a cute girl, friendly but shy. The girls confidence was shaky at best, she always felt a tad awkward, which Jeff couldn&#39;t quite understand. Possessing a round and cute face with long dirty blonde hair and perky B cup breasts, Jeff felt any guy would be lucky to date her. Unfortunately for Jillian, she wasn&#39;t very confident, yet she was an incredibly friendly and intelligent person. Jeff remembering that if Jillian was your friend, she was quite warm and willing to let down her defenses. Fortunately for Jeff the two were on good terms. &quot;Yeah I finished it,&quot; he said. &quot;Did have a little trouble on question four.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you to call me if you had a question ya goof,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Here let me take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff obliged, handing his homework to Jillian who now glanced over his work. &quot;Thanks Jillian,&quot; he smiled. Jillian now looked to Jeff, a shy smile cracking across her face. &quot;Hey no problem,&quot; she said happily. &quot;What are friends for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded in agreement, happy to have a friend he could talk with.</p>
