<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The birth of Animalia had provided for many things that made them attractive to Humans, at least when it came to conversion. At times the high libido of Animalians had also provided for the success of places like the Meat Market, though the strip club retained a full “look don’t touch” policy, and Ms. Fabina had retained that policy as she managed the club. If people wanted to work there or convert to work there, she had no problem with that, as it fit in with a great many of the things that often came with Animalia. It was all normal for the community of anthropomorphic animals.<br />
<br />
However, there were times when attraction to Animalia took things in odd ways as Ms. Fabina was to find out a week or so before Halloween. She was in her office looking over some of the paperwork that covered things that ranged from the plans for the Meat Market’s participation in “Spookyville” and some of the other elements of adult entertainment that the Meat Market helped finance the production of. It wasn’t the best part of the business, but it was necessary and Ms. Fabina wasn’t going to put it off. However, a knock on her office door brought her out of her thoughts for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Ms. Fabina… could you come out for a minute, please?” came the request from the person on the other side of the door, and was likely one of those assigned to man the club’s bar for the night when they opened.<br />
<br />
Ms. Fabina came out to the door and noted some of the work that was going on to make sure the club was open for business. This was all something fairly normal and to be expected while waiting for the opening time. However the bartender who had called her made a motion with his head that drew Ms. Fabina’s attention to the other side of the bar and just inside from the entry area. It was a small group of blond haired women, though Ms. Fabina couldn’t be sure if it was a natural or dyed blond. All three all seemed to be looking over what looked like papers. Ms. Fabina then turned to the bartender.<br />
<br />
“You do realize we are presently closed?” Ms. Fabina spoke firmly with focused eyes.<br />
<br />
“I know, ma’am,” the bartender apologized, “they came in following after one of the girls who has an early show. I tried to tell them we weren’t open yet, but I don’t think they’re here to see a show and I’m not sure they understand that we aren’t open, yet.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Fabina raised an eyebrow as she looked to the bartender and the Great Pyrenees Animalian found herself puzzled at the answer, “they don’t know?”<br />
<br />
“They said they were here to see you,” the bartender answered, “and said something about work or conversion… I’m not sure which… or maybe both.”<br />
<br />
“That makes little sense,” Ms. Fabina said slowly.<br />
<br />
By now the conversation with the bartender had attracted the attention of the three blonds, who stood up, collected their folders and papers, and practically bounced down the bar to where they were practically across from Ms. Fabina. Each came with a fairly wide grin and bright eyes, which looked like they were overjoyed to see her, which only puzzled Ms. Fabina a bit, as she had no clue who any of these three were. It added to the mystery and really didn’t answer any of the questions that she had about them, though she had been drawn out now. She gave a sigh and decided to see on if she could make better sense of them than her bartender.<br />
<br />
“Hey! You’re Ms. Fabina, right?” the first asked<br />
<br />
“I am,” Ms. Fabina said slowly as she looked to the three and noted their smiles grew brighter.<br />
<br />
“Great!” the first cheered, “I’m Trixie.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Dixie,” said the second.<br />
<br />
“And I’m Vixi,” said the third, “and we’re, like, here for a job.”<br />
<br />
“A job?” Ms. Fabina asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Trixie added, “this is a strip club, right?”<br />
<br />
“And people pay for fun?” Dixie added.<br />
<br />
“The Meat Market is a strip club, yes,” Ms. Fabina spoke, “but not a brothel. Workers here are not to have sex with customers. We can branch out into other forms of adult entertainment, but that is entirely with workers on staff who have agreed to the act.”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Vixi smiled, “we’d, like, totally sign up for all of that.”<br />
<br />
That sounded fairly normal, and to a degree, Ms. Fabina had no explicit reason to not hire the three if they really wanted to work. For while the Meat Market had no reason not to hire Humans that wanted to work for the club, there was no rule that said they couldn’t or shouldn’t. The thing that had driven things at the Meat Market had been more about the high libido Animalians had and the fact that even the Humans at Lyre weren’t above gawking at nude or near nude Animalians. She figured that if they wanted to participate in some of the other adult entertainment shows that were put up at times, it could be arranged with an Animalian that wasn’t too big, as so long as these three didn’t get pregnant they wouldn’t be messing with Animalia’s edicts.<br />
<br />
Though the short sentences and the frequent use of the word “like” seemed a bit odd to Ms. Fabina. Hardly anyone she knew ever engaged in anything like that, and that included the Animalians she knew in Lyre and Animalia. These three women seemed to check every box for a stereotypical “bimbo,” and either didn’t notice or were doing it deliberately. And while Human libido’s had a fairly broad range, with some being on par with most Animalians, Ms. Fabina had never met Humans that would fall into the “bimbo” category before, including those that had worked in the adult entertainment industry.<br />
<br />
“May I ask the reason for your interest?” Ms. Fabina asked carefully.<br />
<br />
“Because it’d be fun,” Dixie smiled.<br />
<br />
“And Animalian boys are so totally hot,” Vixi added.<br />
<br />
“I could really go for a good bounce, I bet it’d feel good,” Trixie added, “though… girl Animalians are also hot. I could go with them too… just because they’re hot.”<br />
<br />
“It’d be real fun, to get, like,” Dixie then mused, “like a whole group of them together and with us… it’d be fun.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Ms. Fabina said slowly, “I’m sure I can find an application for the three of you to fill out and we can handle things from there. For the moment the dancing schedule is full, so you may also have to wait with regard to that… and I would need to go over references. All that sort of thing before any sort of hiring can be done.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the three blonds said with almost completely blank looks, “but we have applications.”<br />
<br />
They then produced sets of papers that were fairly standard print-out forms, but they were acceptable under Nevada’s state law and under the base rules for the Meat Market. Ms. Fabina flipped through them and noted that all three were under changed names, as their birth names were under the line for aliases and with Trixie’s full name being Trixie Dix. Dixie’s full name being Dixie Luv and Vixi’s full name Vixi Funn. It only added to the bimbo vibe that the three gave off, but that wasn’t entirely a reason not to hire them, and it appeared that the three had worked at various strip clubs and related industries before<br />
<br />
“I’ll have to go over these in detail,” Ms. Fabina said slowly, “and check your references. How long will you be in town?”<br />
<br />
“You can’t, like, do that today?” Trixie asked.<br />
<br />
“No, and that’s all part of business,” Ms. Fabina asked.<br />
<br />
There were a few frowns from the three, but they didn’t hold it for long and they didn’t answer the question, either. Though, Ms. Fabina did note an apartment in Lyre and three different cellphone numbers, so it wouldn’t be like they would be running away any time soon. So for the moment, she decided to play things coolly and continue with what would be fairly standard with regard to other assorted business that would relate to possible applicants. <br />
<br />
“I will get back to you regarding interviews and decisions,” Ms. Fabina spoke, “though, I should also let you know that if you are to perform in any films that the Meat Market produces, some things will be fairly limited. Particularly with regard to male Animalians. Some… some can be quite big and I am not one to put workers through anything that would give them physical pain.”<br />
<br />
“But wouldn’t working here allow for conversion?” Dixie asked, “I mean… lots of people have started work here after becoming Animalians.”<br />
<br />
“One would think you’d want applicants to convert,” Vixi added.<br />
<br />
“And we’d want to,” Trixie commented, “we’d be totally hot as Animalians.”<br />
<br />
“We would have converted earlier,” Vixi added, “but previous employers didn’t want us to convert. Said something about agitating the health of the guests or clients…”<br />
<br />
“So, we said “screw them” and came here,” Trixie nodded, “where you’d handle our conversions.”<br />
<br />
“Horizon handles the conversion of Humans to Animalians,” Ms. Fabina commented, “and most conversions that would be with another Animalian… at present… would only be done if the Animalian and Human involved are already involved with each other romantically. You will need to go to Horizon and fill out their forms if you wish to become Animalians, yourselves.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t handle that here?” Trixie blinked.<br />
<br />
<br />
“No,” Ms. Fabina answered, “we may sponsor those who wish to join if we have reason to, and that can help with some of the financial costs for you… BUT we would need a good reason for that before doing anything of that nature first.”<br />
<br />
“And what would they require?” Dixie asked.<br />
<br />
“Standard information on your age, personality, along with presenting some indication that you fully understand the base instincts, or potential instincts of the animal who’s from you’d wish to take on as an Animalian,” Ms. Fabina answered, “to try and prevent incidents like what happened with Heather Wilcox’s first appearance in Lyre/Animalia.”<br />
<br />
“Instincts?” Vixi asked.<br />
<br />
“The animal’s behavior,” Ms. Fabina spoke, getting the mental sense that these three not only talked like bimbos and might even been one of those Humans with a high enough libido to qualify as “bimbos,” but had also seriously dumbed themselves down. They weren’t necessarily unattractive physically, and she was sure that there would be a fair number of clubs that would happily employ them just for their looks, but that wasn’t going to work with regard to conversions. “Such as what an herbivore does to find food, how they may fight for mates and how they may respond to certain predators. Or how predators hunt and what animals they would prefer to target. And what they may tolerate in their territory. Things like that.”<br />
<br />
“Could we get a study session?” Trixie asked, which only made Ms. Fabina sigh, as this also seemed like they hadn’t thought anything through and a part of her wondered if they’d be able to present credible information to be able to pass the requirements that Horizon had for conversions.</p>
