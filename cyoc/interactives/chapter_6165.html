<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the interview began the pony seemed well focused on my questions. I saw from his actions a mind throughly enthralled in his sensual form. Even as he laid and then stood before me he kept his erection.<br />
<br />
He had confirmed most of Ely's version of the story when from the farmhouse came the sound of two gun shots. Both the pony and I looked up and turned to see Mrs. Ranskin running from the rear door of the house. My Policeman friend was keeping her distracted for sure. <br />
<br />
The Lady ran for the smokehouse and went inside. I watched as this young Policeman who's name I did not know came stumbling the the rear door of the house. His dark form stood almost hunched over and looking like he was out of breath from the arguement which I expect happened inside.<br />
<br />
The stallion whinnied, which made me turn to look at what he was up to. In a second he was off across the pasture at a high tailed gallop. I, not done with the tough questions took off on a run to see what was indeed happening.<br />
<br />
My Policeman stumbled from the doorway as if injured. I stopped short of the pasture's white fence and knelt down with hope of not being discovered. Pony Chuck stood at the fence rail and whinnied loudly as the man in trouble.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the smokehouse door flew open and there standing now in a silver and black flowing gown stood Mrs. Ranskin. &quot;You dare to confront me over the life and actions of my late husband! I have the power! He was great and I shall be in time even greater with the spirit world than he!&quot; Talking as she walked closer to the Policeman, now leaning on the old water well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, have you come alone? Tell me the truth, is there someone here that needs to be given a lesson from the Spirits?&quot; she growled her words as the Policeman dropped to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I am the only one who was in your home....!&quot; he stammer's out the nonfact. <br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin looks to see her prize stallion standing nearest the fence, and she throws him a smile. &quot;Oh Chuck I thought to give you a new mare from this weeping pile of flesh, but he remind's me of another who came searching. Kazan would remember the saleman my late husband became so enraged with and sent him selling a more basic product. Yes, yes, Officer, what's you name my boy?&quot; she looked down as he looked up from his spot on the grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben, Benjamin Kazan, Ely was my cousin!&quot;<br />
<br />
I gasp and what was worse the stallion turned looking to where I knelt. His action made the Lady look and then turned back to Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;So young one you were the only one in my house! True but not truthful, another came too an they are in the pasture, all the better!&quot; As she tucked one hand into a pocket I saw the glistening sparkle of one silver ring on her left hand. The hand moved slowly to be high in the air as the ring almost glowed in the dank lights. Then her other arm rose to being out straight from her shoulder as the index finger seemed to point toward both me and the stallion.<br />
<br />
As she took a very deep breathe out poured a jumble of words. I clicked on my trusty voice activated tape recorder and held it as high above my head as possible. <br />
<br />
I listened but the words were maybe a German Latin which trailed off to what I was sure to be Hebrew. She slowed her speach as the breath trailed out of her in this long speach of strange words. Then she calmed down and stood looking down at Ben.<br />
<br />
AS all thins went on I crawled up to lay next to the stallion pony by the fence. I watched and the stallion watched but he seemed more enthoused about the possibilities of recieving a new mare. Like in the pasture this oversexed male human with the extreme body parts of the pony stallion stood erect, very erect.<br />
<br />
I watched with interest the Lady and Ben but became distracted by the pony stallion as he began a stallion's ritual of masterbation. This is what caught my attention and still having the taste of his seed about my mouth he was getting me turned on too.<br />
<br />
The stallion's shaft rouse to bump his hairy belly and drooped down like a rock. I found myself inching closer till my face felt the breeze of his falling cock. The musky smell of his pony cock seemed to bring me to a higher state of desire. Licking my lips the desire to taste his seed was on my mind. Part of me down deep screamed of losing one's professionalism, but the feeling and smell argued back.<br />
<br />
I could stand it nomore, my hands grabbed his shaft as it swung by again and fingers proceeded to poke the flat end into my mouth. Needless to say but pony jumped and the stiffened from head to tail and withers to cock. My eyes closed as I lost contact with the real world about me and sucked at the wild fantasy running in my mind.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of my eye was above the Lady in the air a glowing cloud. The cloud whirled in a circle and sparked on occasion. &quot;Ely Kazan made a fine stallion, as now Charles Robertson shall live as a stallion. You and your accomplice are no better than that fool who came to sell his soul to my late husband. Being no better than he, I deem you and that associate to be members together. The two of you shall be a part of the animal world's passion!&quot; Then the cloud lowered on Ben and a short scream trailed off to just an echo throught the valley pasture and trees.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin seemed disturbed that Ben vanished. Poking with her feet around in the dark where she no doubt expected to see him groveling in pain or worse.<br />
<br />
I felt limp, as if the strength of my body had gone and I was at the mercy of this Sorceress. The Lady walked slowly toward Chuck and I. She reached out and petted the stallion's head but I lost sight of her long before that. Her words were friendly till she saw something on the ground and peered over the fence. <br />
<br />
I was caught, she had seen me! The Lady walked quickly to the pasture gate and opened it she walked over to where Chuck stood. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do we have here?&quot; she said as the Lady bent down to the earth. My eyes blinked and peered to one side. I watched something which at first did not ring a bell. The Lady scarffed up a pile of clothes, and shook them in the air as if very angry.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden the world about me shook like an earthquake. The pony and I were thrown about to where I almost lost what was happening. It was then the lady screamed, &quot;CHUCK, CHARLES ROBERTSON STAND STILL!&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt so scared, my body stiffened ready for some terrible thing to happen. The lady knelt down and smiled.<br />
<br />
Laughing she pointed to my face and began laughing all the more. I looked back scared stiff, feeling and wishing I'd never taked this assignment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You my dear explains somewhat the strange disappearance of your friend. I drew upon the spirits to make you mambers together, as he was already under my first spell it was your action which brings meaning to all. No doubt the Stallion was masterbating as he watched myself and Ben. You being a woman by the style of these clothes could not but hold such as his shaft. I called upon the Spitits to make you members together as the salesman. He became a fine bull as Ben would have and you tooo if you were a man. Yet the fact of a woman might have made you a good cow for the bull, but instead you were making passion with the stallion.&quot; she kept talking.<br />
<br />
True all this was true but if Ben disappeared and my clothes are not on me, then where am I?<br />
<br />
I watched her hands reach toward my face. The last second before she would have touched my face she cupped her palms together and lifted my feet from the ground. &quot;You my dear girl will be a true member together with Ben, by your actions, you directed the Spitits to play a trick on me. You see me but I expect you cannot speak! You feel my touch but do not understand my strenght as I hold you even now, don't try to answer!  My dear you have merged with the stallion who is Chuck, you are his beautiful cock!&quot;<br />
<br />
As fear ran through me I felt my body stiffen and was soon swinging about in a mad fit of stallion masterbation.</p>
