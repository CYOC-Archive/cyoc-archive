<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Darlene slept, feeling much better after Alex’s timely rescue; Alex just laid in bed under the slumbering Anthro Artic Fox Fury; his knot was still in Darlene’s vulpine slit. With nothing better to do he opts to rest his eyes as he too relaxes. Sleep was deprived when the sound of a cell phone goes off. It wasn’t his.<br />
“Fuck,” Alex seeing the rudely loud device but unable to reach it. It was Darlene’s phone. It kept blaring for a few more seconds before the call ended.<br />
“I wonder if someone else saw Darlene’s post and is calling out of concern,” Alex extending a paw hand in the direction of the phone.<br />
“Use the force,” Alex drones in a deep and sonorous voice; but nothing happens. His runes don’t glow and the phone doesn’t fly into his paws.<br />
“Worth a shot,” he muttered; “guess I’ll have to wait until we are untied from each other,” Alex placing a hand paw on Darlene’s furry firm ass.<br />
<br />
It was another thirty minutes before he felt his knot deflate and his pinkish and veiny phallus slips from Darlene&#39;s sex. A large pool of his cum spills out of her still stretched entrance; staining the bed sheets as it trickled down his and her furry thighs. Being careful, Alex gently moves Darlene off of him so he can shimmy off the bed and reach for her phone. He wasn’t interested in opening up the device; he didn’t need to make any calls or use her data to troll the internet. The spotted hyena furry had his own phone to do it. Alex grabbed Darlene’s phone in case another phone call came in. He was concerned that they would be calling to check up on her. A valid concern as he saw on her page that she was about to self-terminate. Not caring of the reason, Alex raced to her apartment just in time to save her from dying from an overdose of pills and alcohol.<br />
<br />
“I still have no idea what you took,” Alex grabbing the pill bottle. “The label is ripped off,” Alex examining the bottle. He then takes it to the trash bin in her kitchen; pausing to grab the bourbon, Alex takes a quick swig from the bottle and then promptly spits out the contents.<br />
“Yuck,” Alex smacking his muzzle as he tries to get rid of the taste; “you mixed the pills in with the bourbon. No wonder its only half empty. The taste is retched. I guess that is a good thing,” Alex absently talking to himself as he walks to the kitchen; “If you managed to drink it all, I would have been too late.” Alex then promptly dumps the contents of the spiked bourbon down the sink drain before grabbing a glass of water to wash the still awful taste from his maw.<br />
<br />
Heading back to the bedroom, Alex sees Darlene up; she has her phone and is scrolling her social media page.<br />
“No one commented,” She sighed as she placed the phone down; “not even my dad..”<br />
Alex was about to speak when Darlene got up and approached him. He got aroused when he saw her take the few steps towards him. Those few steps allowed him to see her furry breasts sway about as her hips sashayed in that come-hither fashion.<br />
“But you came,” Darlene rubbing her hand paws all over Alex’s furry chest; sighing as she takes the glass of water and takes a sip.<br />
<br />
“You mind telling why you tried to kill yourself,” Alex speaking up; giving Darlene a chance to step back and sit back on her bed.<br />
“My father cut me off,” Darlene sighed; “I have until the end of the month to come up with $2,500 for rent or I’m homeless.”<br />
“Why did your father cut you off,” Alex sitting next to Darlene; “I know you two don’t exactly get along.”<br />
“It’s because of my stepmother,” Darlene sobbing; “she would rather my dad spend his money taking her to Fiji then for me to get my art degree.”<br />
“What about your bio mom,” Alex recalling the few times; Darlene brought up her family. He tried to pay attention in the past, but always found ways to change the conversation to something that brought Darlene’s spirits up; however Alex felt this wasn’t the time to try that trick.<br />
“My mother hasn’t been in my life since I was ten,” Darlene crying; “She and dad did not have the most amicable of divorces. You know the funny thing,” Darlene looking at Alex; “My dad was the one who cheated but still managed to come out on top in the end. He used every dirty trick to ruin my mother both mentally and financially. I didn’t find that out until my bitch of a stepmother mentioned it in one of her many passive aggressive ways to emotionaly tear me down. I lost all trust of my dad when I found out,” Darlene placing her head on Alex’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Any aunts and uncles,” Alex asking with a sigh. While his family situation wasn’t any better; growing up dirt poor in West Virginia taught him that it wasn’t shameful to ask family to help out where they can. Be it a few dollars for groceries or a place to stay until the living situations get better; Family was the one resource he had an abundance of.<br />
“Not to my knowledge; if they exist, my father never bothered to inform me.” Darlene getting up to get a better look at her new furry self. Turning on the bedroom light and closing the door; she gets a good look at herself from the large mirror mounted to the back of the door.<br />
“Oh,” Darlene exclaims as she see her body covered in white fur. Cupping her breasts, she notes that they are at least a cup size larger than what they were when she was human. Darlene also noted that they were firmer; she could feel a dense layer of muscle at the bottom, ensuring the breasts do not sag or fly about in wild abandoned. Noticing her triangular shaped ears on top of her head, she consciously managed to swivel them and twitch them. This elicited a slight giggle as she finally stopped tearing up.<br />
“I look almost like my cosplay character,” Darlene grabbing a sketch book and staring at a similar white furred fox anthro she drew a few days ago. The drawing showed the character with clothing. Billowing pastel blue capris with a matching bra. Hoop ear rings along both ears and a comically large broadsword mounted on her back.<br />
“I can tell you this much,” Alex looking at the drawing and then at Darlene; “the clothing will not work, it will irritate the fur. Plus modesty is a human concept,” Alex opening the bedroom door; “the fur will keep us warm and hide the naughty bits.” Alex adding with a sly wink.<br />
“It’s not hiding your impressive package,” Darlene closing the sketch book as she eyes Alex’s furry balls and hyena penis as it peaks out of his sheath.<br />
“Nor is it hiding your pink nipples, and vulpine cookie,” Alex smirking; “but is that something that concerns you?”<br />
“No,” Darlene pausing; “no it doesn’t.”<br />
<br />
Darlene was about to ponder the runes running along her wrists and ankles when her phone goes off again. Checking the caller I.D, the acrtic fox furry doesn’t recognize the number but does know the area code.<br />
“416,” Darlene speaking; “that is a Toronto area code. I don’t know anyone in Toronto.”<br />
“Well answer it before they give up,” Alex looking confused as he finally take a sip of the water he poured himself earlier.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” Darlene answering; “who is this?”<br />
Alex couldn’t hear what was being said. He could use his runes to magically enhance his hearing if he chose, but decided it was best not to pry. Instead he just observed as Darlene left the bedroom to the living room. She was searching through a box she pulled out of a cupboard.<br />
“The number is 621-296-472,” Darlene answering; “does that match what you have?”<br />
There was another moment of silence before Darlene spoke again.<br />
“Thank you, and yes i will be waiting for your follow up call.”<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence before Darlene looked at Alex with tears from her eyes. “That was a law firm in Toronto. Apparently I have a grandmother on my mother’s side I never met who passed away recently. She left me everything.”<br />
“I’m sorry,” Alex not sure how to process this; “what just happened?”<br />
“I just inherited $50 million Canadian,” Darlene sitting down as she started to shake; “if you hadn’t shown up.”<br />
<br />
Without a word, Alex rushed over to comfort Darlene as she once again broke down crying.<br />
“Why didn’t dad tell me,” Darlene sobbing; “why did he isolate me so much? I thought he cared for me. Was I just a pawn to him?” Darlene kept blubbering as she fell into Alex’s arms.<br />
“Why not ask him,” Alex just trying of offer comfort; “at least now, you won’t be evicted and can still finish college.”<br />
“I guess that is a small comfort,” Darlene finally showing a small smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
A few more hours later and many more phone calls, Darlene was beginning to feel better about herself. The smell of a deluxe pizza baking in the oven helped, as she was feeling very hungry. Watching as Alex gritted his teeth as he forced himself to put on oven mitts. Already irritated at the constrictive garments matting his fur; he suffered through the discomfort, as burning the calloused pads on his hand paws would be far worse if he pulled the hot pan out of the oven with out protection.<br />
“Plates are in the cupboard next to the microwave,” Darlene already drooling with ravenous hunger.<br />
“And the pizza cutter,” Alex looking thorough the drawers, before having to settle on a large bread knife that looked sharp. Cutting up the pizza in relatively even slices, he places a few on the plates he grabbed and passed one to Darlene. She didn’t even bother to wait or walk to the nearby table before she already had half of the first slice in her muzzle as she savagely tore it apart.<br />
“Any more details on this inheritance,” Alex eating his first slice with restraint, despite that he was also hungry.<br />
“A lawyer from Toronto is on the way to meet me,” Darlene speaking between bites; “I got some papers to sign and what not. Unfortunately they won’t be here until November 1st. I told them that my rent is due on the 31st, so they are going to wire money to me from a trust fund. It should be ready for me tomorrow.”<br />
“Well that’s good then,” Alex nodding; “You want to take a stroll after eating the pizza?”<br />
“That would be nice,” Darlene smiling; “to think I was about to throw it all away because my dad decided to abandoned me.”<br />
“Then Alex Voltsnout comes and rescues his mate from jaws of death and despair,” Alex smiling as he puts his empty plate down.<br />
“Does this mean I’m Darlene Voltsnout,” The arctic Fox fury grabbing another slice of pizza.<br />
“You could hyphenate if you choose,” Alex shrugging his furry shoulders; “but our cubs would be Voltsnouts’.”<br />
“Nah,” Darlene smiling as she rips a chunk of pizza from the slice in her hand paw; chewing the mixture of cheese, sauce, peppers, mushrooms and pepperoni before swallowing; “New life, new beginnings, new name.”</p>
