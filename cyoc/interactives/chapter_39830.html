<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared considered his options. He knew that standing in a field as a gorgeous female in skins would only lead to problems if someone caught him. He decided to go home. In his mind, it was the only real choice.<br />
<br />
He put the amulet in his jeans pocket, picked up the rest of his clothes and started walking home.<br />
<br />
The trip through the field was otherwise uneventful.<br />
<br />
Jared's calm demeanour scared even him. He felt more confident then he remembered ever feeling. He knew he was beautiful but he also knew he was strong.<br />
<br />
The sun beat down on his body as he left the field. He was now on a road that led to his house. The cement road under his bare feet was hot and the rocks on the shoulder only served to irritate his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;My shoes probably won't fit but it's worth a try,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
Jared put his clothes on the ground and was mindful that any car passing would see him. Confidence or not, he didn't want to explain to anyone just why he was currently female and dressed in such a way.<br />
<br />
He tried his shoes only to see that they fit reasonably well.<br />
<br />
&quot;No dainty feet for me,&quot; Jared said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Then a realization hit him. People wouldn't know who he was. If anything, he'd just have to explain why he was wearing skins and carrying clothes.<br />
<br />
Shrugging his shoulders, Jared continued walking. The sun was warm and he was starting to sweat. He would probably need to shower when he got home. Now that was something he looked forward to. He wanted to test this body out while he still had it, he planned on finding a way to change back but didn't want to miss out on an opportunity to have a little fun.<br />
<br />
A few cars passed by as Jared walked. He knew the drivers and passengers were checking him out. One even whistled at him! It was a somewhat disturbing thought. <br />
<br />
New confidence or not, the Jared we know was still in there. Jared was used to some people driving by and screaming at him when he walked home alone. He never understood why it was such a big deal for a guy to walk home alone. Though he also realized that some guys would find it odd for a girl not to have a boyfriend as though they needed one to be valid. Being female helped Jared to see how sexist this way. He planned on doing something to be better then that once he changed back (assuming he could!).<br />
<br />
Jared also realized another all to important lesson that he'd never thought much of until now. Despite still being Jared for the most part, being female would make people react to him in a different way. He wondered how many guys would want to spend time with him even once they knew who he was just because of the body he currently had. It was human nature but it still upset Jared.<br />
<br />
He quickened his pace when he started feeling more vulnerable.<br />
<br />
When he got home, he saw that no one was home. It was a bit of a relief as it would delay him having to explain just who this buxom female was.<br />
<br />
He fished the key out of his pants pocket, unlocked the front door, walked inside and closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Breathing a sign of relief, Jared took his shoes off and walked into the kitchen. There was a note on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jared, your mother and I went out for the evening. Sorry for the short notice. We'll be back tonight. Here's some money to get a pizza.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared shrugged his shoulders. &quot;At least I have some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked upstairs to his room and put his clothes on his bed. Then he looked at his reflection.<br />
<br />
Indeed, he'd become a gorgeous young woman. Looking back and forth, he smiled before slipping the skins off and putting them on his bed. He made his way to the bathroom to look at himself in the full body mirror.<br />
<br />
The reflection looking at him was one of beauty but also strength. She perhaps wasn't the bombshell you'd see in a porno magazine but she also had strength and confidence that went beyond her looks. Jared knew that perhaps these were things he only imagined her to be but he also felt that she was someone that wouldn't spend all of her time giggling and didn't believe in labels such as boy and girl stuff.<br />
<br />
Jared felt dirty. He needed a shower.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the shower and turned the water on before stepping in. A part of him felt that what he was doing was wrong. He should have been trying to find a way to change back, not enjoying a body that nature never intended him to have access to.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like she'll know,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
He stepped into the shower, allowing the warm water to dampen his soft skin. Jared had never understood the commercials for women's shower products that made showering come across as an almost sexual experience. However, as he used his mother's body wash (the only viable choice it seemed) to lather himself, his perception of those commercials changed.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was just this girl's body or maybe all women's had bodies this sensitive, Jared wasn't sure. What he was sure of was how wonderful this felt.<br />
<br />
Guilt washed away as he allowed the moment to envelop him and he enjoyed everything this body had to offer.<br />
<br />
When he turned off the water and stepped out of the shower sometime later, he was clean but, he also knew that he was dirty if only perhaps in a ethical sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, I've had my fun. I'd better change back now,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
He walked into his room and found the amulet in his pants pocket. Some regret hit him knowing he was going back to plain 'ol Jared but he knew that he couldn't stay this way.</p>
