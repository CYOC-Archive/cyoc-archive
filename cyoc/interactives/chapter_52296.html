<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dress-rehearsal took another hour after the two girls returned to the stage.  Everything went well enough that the drama teacher let the cast go early.  Being Friday, everyone was eager to leave quickly.  None more-so than Naomi and Jennifer.  The two exited the backstage into back hall of the school still dressed in their animal costumes.  Naomi was bustling to get home before her time ran out and the town curse began again.  But for all their eagerness they did not rush to leave.  As they made their way to their lockers, the two girls noticed they were being followed by a freshman.  Talking in low whispers they tried to ignore him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little pig, little pig, won't you let me come in?&quot; the boy said finally when they had found themselves in an empty part of the school's halls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Jen stopping, &quot;I know that voice.  It's like the one of that jack-ass freshman that thinks he can do magic things?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi made eye contact with Jen to see if she wanted Naomi to play any part of this show-down.  Jen knew fully that Naomi had the power of the curse at the moment.  It would have been little bother to switch the magic over to Jen so she could use it on Kyle but Jen was not going to give in so easily.  Jen made a subtle sign that she wanted Naomi to keep quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did do magic.  The curse is real and I could not be happier that you are forced to be a pig now, Jen.  How does it feel to be part sow, Bitch?&quot;  Kyle evidently could not see that the pig nose and ears on Jen's head were fake.  He had not seen the outburst from before and was just going on faith that the curse had made Jen a pig-girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, you bastard, I can't believe you could do such a thing to me,&quot; Jen said sobbing a little.  She added a realistic snort and pig squeal to complete the illusion that she had been turned part animal. &quot;I mean there is nothing more humiliating to be turned into some part animal thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Serves you right, Bitch, for pantsing me last week,&quot; Kyle gloated.  &quot;I am going to make you so sorry for doing that to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, I can't believe that you would be so stupid though.&quot;  Jen ceased pretending to be sad and was now smiling in her most wicked way.  She snorted once again before continuing.  &quot;I know all about how the curse works, Kyle.  Do you really think it is smart to fuck with someone using magic that then lets them do the same to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle's gloating smile faded slowly.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, Transform or Dare?  Ass-hole.&quot;  Jen said coldly.  Her anger was real and almost palpable.  Even if at this moment Jen did not have the magic of the curse and was not currently a pig, she was so angry at Kyle for trying to screw with her that the reality of the situation dawned on Kyle that he had made a terrible mistake.<br />
<br />
Kyle visually palled under Jenifer's glare.  All he had wanted to do was taunt Jen and make her feel bad for what she had done.  He had unwittingly placed himself in the perfect position to be hurt.  As the seconds ticked off, Kyle almost started to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare,&quot; Kyle finally said meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare, huh?&quot; Jen said. &quot;To chicken to take what to give out?  Then for that Kyle, I dare you to piss yourself a little whenever you get to within ten feet of a girl you find pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle started to shake with fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy, Jen,&quot; Naomi suddenly spoke up, &quot;I think he is going to piss himself right now.  Either he gets off from screwing pigs or you have really scared him.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the girls laughed at his expense, Kyle inspected himself and found no urine stains on his pants.  Some of his confidence returned when he realized that he once again had the curse.  &quot;Hey, Jen!  Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Jen.  &quot;Oh, right.  I'll pick Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now who is stupid, Jen.  I haven't wet myself so I guess I don't like you.  But that can change.  I dare you to become a cock-slave who will do anything to see and touch a cock and you will do anything that someone asks when they call you 'Bitch', 'Slut', or 'Whore'. Ha, ha, ha!  Now who is in control, Bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked momentarily mortified by what Kyle had said.  Then she started panting.  Naomi had to bite her lips to keep from smiling or laughing and ruining the scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Kyle.  You are in control.  I will do anything for you.&quot;  Jen was talking in a breathless tone and trying her best to be sexy as she made her way closer to Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha!  That is right, I am in control.  Slut, do you want to see my dick?&quot; Kyle said evilly.  Jen moaned slightly but did not answer.  &quot;Bitch, you want to suck on my dick and make me cum.  Whore, you want to do it right now.  Slut get on your knees and suck me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
From where Naomi stood she could see Jen start to crouch over in front of Kyle.  She could see his erection forming a tent in his sweat-pants.  Naomi for a moment doubted that she still had the curse.  Maybe it had spread to others?  Maybe Kyle had found some way of keeping the power while passing it on?  But then suddenly Jen stopped acting as kicked Kyle as hard as she could right in his crotch.<br />
<br />
There was a loud yelp of pain and Kyle slumped to the floor bent double holding his groin.  Jen stood over him and removed her pig nose and ears showing Kyle that she was still the beautiful teen girl she had always been.<br />
<br />
&quot;You moron.  Magic isn't real. See?  Your curse is fake.  It didn't work.  Now you have to live with being a failure.  Enjoy your bruising.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the girls walked away laughing at Kyle.  Their voices echoing in the hall as he lay whimpering on the floor confused and alone.  He would never know how close he had come to actually getting his revenge.<br />
<br />
Later the two girls meet at Naomi's house to play with the magic curse.</p>
