<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Ken was finally released from the tank, he was still somewhat asleep. It took another fifteen minutes for him to wake up, already dried off by someone else and sat naked in a chair. Tommy was at a near computer, reading off data.<br />
Ken was quick to leave as he was told he could, not feeling any different then before beside being bald. He had been told to call if anything weird happened to him or wait for his meeting the next evening. But as it was rather late already and Ken was still tired, he soon went home to get some sleep.<br />
While he ate some fast-food on his way, he felt a bit of stiffness in his muscles, both in his back and his legs, but had no idea what it really was. “Maybe I get some sore muscles from the time in the tank?” he thought to himself. He decided to take a hot, relaxing shower before going to bed at home, maybe that would help.<br />
After said shower, which didn´t help him with the soreness, Ken laid down in his bed. Something else had went unnoticed by him until now. Somehow, he felt a hollowness inside his body, as if something was missing. But he was neither hungry nor had he any problems breathing, so it was neither his stomach nor his lungs. It was just a general feeling. With a little trouble, he soon fell asleep.<br />
In his dream he was again in the lab he had been in before, seeing the tank he had been in from the side. But what was weird was that he couldn´t move his body. He had no idea what happened around him, he couldn´t move his head or even his eyes, couldn´t talk. It was as if he was completely immobile, a thought that even in the dream unsettled him, but he couldn´t even wake up.<br />
This situation continued through the whole night. To Ken, it felt like an eternity. It only ended when he felt something touch his dream-body. All of the sudden, he was wide awake in his bed again. He nearly jumped out of it, not even realizing that his bed-sheets were still as smooth as they were when he felt asleep. It wasn´t only in his dream he hadn´t moved, the whole night his body had simply laid there, completely steady in position, only breathing calmly.<br />
So, when Ken sat up, he felt sore all over, even more than the evening before. He slowly stood up and moved to his bathroom, taking another hot shower. It eased him only a little. Afterwards he went into his kitchen, ready to get some cereal for breakfast. A quick look at the clock on the wall showed him it was only eight in the morning. “Weird, normally I´m sleeping longer in the weekends” Ken thought as he moved to the table. But just as he sat down on his chair, his bowl in front of him, something happened.<br />
All of the sudden, he felt something touch his ass in a completely unnatural way. Before he could even look, whatever it was pushed into his ass. With a yelp he jumped up, nearly toppling his table over, while the feeling got more and more intense. He even felt something wiggling near his bladder. Ken felt around in his boxers, searching his ass for whatever was in there, but there was nothing in it, it only was spread wide open somehow.<br />
Just as he grabbed his phone, thinking he needed to call the lab, the same feeling appeared again, only this time right on his lips. His mouth was pushed wide open as well, and something pushed inside, pressing his tongue flat inside his mouth. It wiggled in until it hit his throat, making him gag. And like with his ass, there was nothing there when he touched his mouth, he could even put his finger inside and touch his tongue, just not move his tongue or close his mouth.<br />
“Whhhmmm hmmmmm tmmm mmmmm?” Ken pressed out, unable to speak, just mumble faintly. Whatever this was, it clearly wasn´t normal. He could faintly taste something like skin inside, wiggling in his throat. Said skin tasted a bit salty. <br />
While calling was out, Ken decided to text his brother, still in panic for whatever was happening to him. A new feeling from his feet stopped his actions, however. Looking down, Ken saw nothing, even as it felt like his feet were pulled away from him and made longer. Then, an unnatural pressure built up in them, and more so his toes. He couldn´t move them any longer, and they felt like they were pulled in a knot or something like that. What was more, it felt like his cock was tightly pressed against something warm inside his boxers.<br />
Before Ken had sorted out that feelings or done anything but moan quietly in pain, something quiet similar happened to his hands and fingers. In panic, Ken tried to grab his phone, only for it to drop out of his stiffly bound hands and immobile fingers. They felt suddenly just as knotted as his toes were. And whatever had happened to his cock, now affected his tongue just as strong, pressing it even more into the bottom of his open mouth.<br />
–<br />
Tommy had smiled when Ken left the lab, already thinking about the shoes that had now been attuned to Ken´s body. It would need some time, so he decided to wait for the next morning to try them on. After finishing up his notes, he soon headed to his flat near the lab, ate some apples as a small dinner before going to bed, full of excitement to finally put the shoes on the next morning. He dreamt about what he could do with Ken later, without him resisting Tommy anymore.<br />
Tommy woke to his alarm at six thirty. After a quick shower and a fast breakfast he was on his way over to the lab. Around seven thirty, he checked in, and quickly took the shoes of their pedestal next to the water tank. He took them over to his desk, but before he could put them on, he was called out a short talk about the test subject, namely his brother Ken. <br />
Finally back in the lab, he was quick to lock the door, move over to the desk and pulled of his old shoes and socks. “For the first few times, I won´t need any socks in that shoes” he thought grinning. The clock on his computer showed it was a minute after eight.<br />
Tommy wiggled the toes on the edge of the left shoe first, the one connected to Ken´s ass and lower half. Then he pushed in, wiggling his way deep inside. Not securing it for now, he then took a moment to think about what Ken was feeling right now, before he grabbed the right shoe. He teased the edges of that shoe as well, before pushing into it. That show was connected to Ken´s mouth and upper body, and he liked the idea of his toes rubbing over Ken´s lips before pushing into them. Both shoes felt a bit warm, and Tommy wiggled his toes in both shoes for a bit.<br />
Satisfied by how the shoes felt, Tommy then bend down and slowly tied his left shoe tight, followed by his right one. When he sat back up, he was sure Ken was feeling filled on both ends right now, and started his work in the lab, taking every opportunity to walk around in the shoes.<br />
–<br />
Ken was helpless. He stood in his kitchen still, mouth wide open and unmoving, feeling pressure on both his cock and tongue, as well as inside his ass and mouth in general. His hands and feet nearly unmovable, fingers and toes completely stiff. He had no idea what to do right now. He couldn´t speak, and his hands were useless. He had no way of contacting the lab right now, and he would die in embarrassment if he walked there right now, naked beside his boxers. And with his unresponsive hands, he would never get any clothes put on to wear.<br />
“Maybe Tommy will come over if I don´t show up in the lab later today?” Ken hoped. Maybe he would know a way to help, or at least why he was feeling this way right now. But what would he do now, waiting for hours?<br />
Before he could decide what to do with his time, a high pressure suddenly hit his back, making him topple over, landing on his arms and legs. The same pressure hit his legs while it lifted from his back, and he ended flat on the ground. Then it again hit his back while leaving his legs. And that circle continued for a couple of minutes before the pressure faded mostly. But Ken didn´t move from his spot on his kitchen floor. “What the hell was that? What´s happening with me?” he thought frightened.<br />
Over the course of the next few hours, with Ken had slowly crawled over to his couch and climbed it, that circle of pressure and the connected pain reappeared more times than he could count. He had, by now, pissed his boxers from the pain, and just hoped Tommy would be quick in looking for him.<br />
–<br />
When the time of Ken´s appointment neared, Tommy waited for him to come, but was disappointed. Ken didn´t show up, not even late. He called Ken´s phone, but it was on voicemail. So, after leaving two messages, Tommy headed out of the lab. He enjoyed a walk in the nearby park, took a jog around the block and got some groceries before heading home.<br />
Just as he was grabbing his shoelaces on the right shoe, he thought better about it. “If Ken thinks he can abandon me while his body is linked to my shoes, I will just keep them on for now.” So, Tommy kept them on while he made himself some dinner, and then watched a movie tiredly, soon to fall asleep with the shoes still on.<br />
–<br />
Ken had no clock in his living room, normally his TV would show the time if needed, or his phone would. But his phone was still somewhere on the kitchen floor, and the remote for the TV was not in reach as well. So, he just laid there, unable to do much more than moan muffled in pain when the pressure circle begun again.<br />
Sometimes he was out cold after the pain subdued, only to nearly jump when it suddenly came back. The most intense said pain got later, when it didn´t let up for what felt like hours. Then, after that, he felt a small tug on his fingers, but nothing happened. But after one additional time of the pressure circle, there was nothing but a couple of wiggles both inside his mouth and ass, and he slowly drifted of to sleep. While it was weird to do so with both his mouth and ass stretched wide open, he couldn´t help it.<br />
As soon as he was asleep, he again was completely unmovable. But instead of the lab and the tank, he was suspended in the air, looking straight at a running television. He couldn´t look away again, but at least it was something else then watching a silent room. Ken took notice that the taste of something salty had increased here, but had still no idea what it was coming from.<br />
Maybe an hour later the TV switched off, and Ken was again tortured with boredom. At least he wasn´t in pain while he dreamt, went through his head.<br />
Hours later, in which Ken just hung there lifeless, something was moving a bit more than before. Suddenly, with some quick movement, which would have given Ken some vertigo if he was awake, the world turned form hanging mid-air watching the shut-off TV, to connecting to the ground, watching some wooden floor.<br />
An then, Ken got some explanation for his situation. His brother yawned above him somewhere. “Oh, I guess I fell asleep watching that movie.  I didn´t even took my shoes off for the night. Hmmm... Well, serves Ken right for abandoning me yesterday. I hope he had to suck the sweat of my toes during the night. Maybe he even dreamt about me? Well, I need to get ready, my alarm will go off in about ten minutes anyway.”<br />
While Ken tried to make sense of that, his brother slowly got up and moved over to his bathroom. He didn´t took his shoes off, just washed his hair and face and did his business, before heading to his bedroom and got something to wear. “ don´t think Ken needs release for now, I guess I will just pull the jeans on without taking the shoes off.<br />
And just as Ken´s vision turned dark when the shorts Tommy wore dropped down, he woke up in his flat, on his couch, breathing heavily.<br />
“What the hell was that?” Ken thought. “Was that really a dream or …? But that would be impossible.” And while he was thinking, the pressure circle again started up.<br />
–<br />
Tommy had put his clothes on, grabbed some fruits to eat on his way and moved out. Maybe today Ken would show up. And if not, well, tomorrow he should see him in class. If not … he would go look for him than.<br />
–<br />
And so the Sunday went by, Tommy working on something in the lab, enjoying his experiments and all, while Ken still didn´t left his couch, still thinking about his weird dream. It would explain his situation, but was that really possible?</p>
