<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was just a normal day at a certain household. Withing it a mother and her youngest son were getting ready to meet the rest of the family for dinner. The young boy in question John had baseball practice and was home later than the others. &quot;John! Hurry up or we&#39;ll be late!&quot; the mother named Cindy yelled out. &quot;Coming!&quot; was the only word he replied with. A few seconds latter John came running down the stairs. &quot;Don&#39;t hurry too fast sweetie. I&#39;ll wait in the car so put your shoes on and lock the door.&quot; &quot;Kay!&quot; John replied. &quot;And please don&#39;t call me sweetie. I&#39;m not a five year old anymore,&quot; he added. &quot;Sure, sure&quot; Cindy lightly teased as she walked towards the door. But as she moved closer, she felt her feet get looser in her shoe. &quot;How odd... Did I put on a wrong pair?&quot; Cindy thought to herself, but she was definitely wearing the right ones. &quot;Hmph! Hmph!&quot; In the corner, Cindy could hear John grunting. She turned around. &quot;Sweetie? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; &quot;Hmph! Mommy, its my shoes. Hmph! They won&#39;t go on.&quot; &quot;What? Don&#39;t be silly. We just got you those shoes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ignoring the uncomfortable feeling in her own shoes, Cindy walked towards John and bent down. &quot;Let me see.&quot; John did as he was told and let his mom touch his shoes. Cindy tries to put them on herself, but was unable to either. &quot;That&#39;s... strange.&quot; John wasn&#39;t resisting either, so it definitely wasn&#39;t him playing a prank on her. Confused Cindy took off the shoe. &quot;What?&quot; Cindy looked dumbfounded. She had just gotten new socks too, but John&#39;s Big Toe was sticking out of it. John, also dumbfounded lifted his foot and wiggled his toe to see that it was really out there. And then it got even stranger. The top of the sock&#39;s fabric lifted out more and more until the rest ripped open leaving John&#39;s toes exposed to the open air. It was like his feet were growing and what&#39;s more was that his toe nails looked pink. Like they were polished. &quot;Mommy? What&#39;s going on with my feet?&quot; Cindy didn&#39;t say a word as something was shifting in her own shoes. She knelled down to take them off. Meanwhile John took off his other shoe to see his toes outside too. As Cindy took her shoes off, she was greeted with another weird sight. Her socks were flopping on her feet as if they got smaller. She took them off and saw that her own feet were shrinking. She had just got her nails done recently, but they were as clear of polish as could be. &quot;What the hell?&quot; she thought to herself. &#39;Pop&#39; &#39;Pop&#39; Cindy heard a small noise and looked  towards John. His socks had ripped of his feet completely. &quot;Mommy!&quot; John was scared now as he called out to Cindy. &quot;Come upstairs!&quot; was all she said as she took of her own socks. John followed her up the stairs. As he looked forward, he could see his Mom&#39;s long hair moving up her back. &quot;Mommy, now your hair is shrinking!&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; Cindy touched her hair, but found she couldn&#39;t reach it. &quot;Shit, shit, shit!&quot; Completely in shock, Cindy couldn&#39;t help but curse in front of her 8 year old son as they moved towards her room.<br />
<br />
Cindy moved in as John closed the door behind her and as she turned around, &quot;AH!&quot; &quot;AH!&quot; John screamed back. &quot;What?!&quot; &quot;Sweetie, YOUR hair!&quot; &quot;What about my hair? Ah!&quot; John moved his hands and caught hair at his back. And it was no longer brown either, but a dark blond. &quot;Why is my hair so long?! And why is your hair so short?!&quot; Cindy said nothing as she moved towards the mirror in her room. She stood dumbfounded and touched her hair. It was incredibly short and brown colored. And what&#39;s more was that she could see her entire body in the mirror standing up, even though she always needed to bend down a bit to do that. It was then that Cindy realized what was happening. She moved towards John and touched his face as she stared into his eyes. &quot;Mommy... You&#39;re scaring me...&quot; &quot;John... What color are my eyes?&quot; Cindy asked. &quot;Bl-Blue...&quot; John answered, even though they were supposed to be green. And John&#39;s eyes were green, even though they were supposed to be blue. &quot;Shit!&quot; Cindy cursed once more. &quot;Mom?!&quot; &quot;Oh god! Sweetie, take off your clothes!&quot; Cindy said as she did the same. &quot;What?! No! I don&#39;t wanna be naked with you!&quot; &quot;Just do what I say!&quot; John flinched at his mother&#39;s harsh words and reluctantly did as he was told.<br />
<br />
A minuted later, both Cindy and John were buck naked. John covered his junk, but Cindy was too preoccupied with what was happening to their bodies to cover her modesty. John reluctantly looked at his mother though she looked different. Her hair was a short as a man&#39;s and she looked a little younger too. &quot;So, what&#39;s happening to us?!&quot; John asked. &quot;Listen John... I want you to listen carefully... But I think you and I are switching bodies.&quot; &quot;What?! No way! That&#39;s...&quot; But before John could protest further, she noticed his Mom shrinking. No that wasn&#39;t quite right. He could see above the bed little by little. He looked down and his nipple looked puffy. He lifted his hands from his penis to touch them. &quot;Ah!&quot; As he did he jumped. They felt really sensitive. He watched in horror was his nipples stuck out more. &quot;Ah! Ah! Mommy! I think I&#39;m growing boobies!&quot; John looked back towards his Mom touching her own boobs, or rather where her boobs used to be. She was flat as a board and even more than that. &quot;Mommy! I&#39;m at your eye level!&quot; Cindy jerked up just in time to have to look up at her own son. &quot;Ah! Johnny!&quot; &quot;Mommy! Help!&quot; John looked down at his shrinking Mom. She was almost his original height now. Her body was slightly chubby like a little kid&#39;s, like his own once was. &quot;No! I don&#39;t wanna be Mommy!&quot; &quot;Johnny! JoHnNY! Ah&quot; Cindy touched her neck as her voice got a little deeper. It wasn&#39;t that of a man&#39;s though, but a little boy. And not just any little boy, but his own. &quot;Mommy! MoMmY! No!&quot; John&#39;s voiced heightened in pitch until he sounded just like his mother. He felt his butt cheeks tighten. &quot;Ugh!&quot; John clamped his butt and feel to the ground. &quot;Johnny?!&quot; Cindy tried to move towards him, but she lost balance on her tiny feet and tripped. Her own ass felt looser as it flapped up and down a little.<br />
<br />
They both sat up. Looking at each other, they watched what was once their body on the other with only one major change left. &quot;Ah! Agh!&quot; John was the first to react a pressed on his junk. &quot;John?!&quot; &quot;Ah! Ah! My pee-pee! It hurts! Agh! Like its digging into my body! Agh!&quot; John tried to move his hands and noticed his balls were gone and his penis was halfway gone as well. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; was all Cindy could say as she and John watched his penis suck back into his body. Once inside, John pressed on his stump of a groin. &quot;Agh! Mommy! It hurts! It hurts! Make it stop!&quot; Tears and snot dripped down John&#39;s, now Cindy&#39;s face. He felt his insides on fire as his uterus and ovaries formed. The open slit were his cock and balls once were formed into a clitoris. And suddenly his pain ceased. He lay down on the ground, breathing heavily and somewhat erotically. The pain caused him to lose control of his bowels and he pissed himself. &quot;Johnny...&quot; Cindy watched his son with tears in her eyes. &quot;Ah... Ahh! Jesus!&quot; Suddenly it was Cindy&#39;s turn to push on her pelvis. Her insides felt like they were on fire as her uterus and ovaries shrunk and pushed outwards. &quot;Agh! Oh god! It&#39;s coming out!&quot; Ahh!&quot; Cindy opened up her hands to see something sticking out of her clit. Two circular shapes of flesh pushed out of her. The baggy skin soon filled up with two balls and with it a mushroom shaped piece of flesh. &quot;Oh god! Oh god! I&#39;m growing a fucking dick!&quot; The mushroom was soon followed by a stem made of flesh no smaller then about three inches. Cindy convulsed once as her kiddy dick shot out of her. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh!!&quot; Cindy collapsed to the floor as she too let go of her bowels, a stream of piss came all over her. &quot;Blegh!&quot; Cindy got up and covered her penis as the warm liquid covered her hands. She was able to stop it though. &quot;Fucking hell! I can&#39;t believe I just peed myself!&quot; &quot;Mommy?&quot; Cindy looked up to see an older woman looking over her, some leftover urine dripping from her body. It was a face she knew well. She looked down at herself and saw the body of a little boy no less than eight. &quot;Fuck!&quot; was all she could say. She was John now and John was herself.</p>
