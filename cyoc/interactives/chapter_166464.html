<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No, I&#39;m tired and dizzy aand confused. It&#39;s better that I go to sleep.&quot; Nick said before he left the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  But we didn&#39;t finish our shower!&quot; Riley replied as he followed Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I I don&#39;t really feel comfortable with this.&quot; Nick said. &quot;I need to digest that my best friend is a furball. That I&#39;m a furball!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand why you are acting like this.&quot; Riley said as he watched Nick looking for clothes. &quot;You seemed so happy a moment ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick took some pants, underwear and shirts but he soon realized that he was too big now for his clothing. He desperately tried to wear a pair of boxers but they got stuck in his thick thighs, just below his pendulous dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. I think I&#39;m going to sleep nude tonight.&quot; Nick said as he drop his boxers on the floor. &quot;I saw a clothing store this morning. I&#39;ll try to get some new clothes tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that, Nick jumped on his bed and tried to sleep despite he was really uncomfortable with his new self. Those longer limb, the big muscles and his new musk were something he didn&#39;t have to deal with before. However, after almost an hour he managed to fall asleep soundly.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Riley was still looking at his body in the bathroom. Unlike Nick he liked how he looked. He was proud of his juicy pecs, his broad back and the pelt of hair covering his chest. He was an adult! It was a dream come true! He stayed in front of a mirror flexing and posing. He loved how his bigger dick didn&#39;t stop swinging all the time!<br />
<br />
He looked at it and smiled. It was the best cock he had ever seen! Well, it&#39;s not like he had seen a lot of grown ups dicks before. Just his and... Nick!<br />
<br />
He remembered that his friend was now sleeping. He can&#39;t understand why he forgot about that, because Nick&#39;s snores could be heard all over the room. He assumed that&#39;s what happens when you have a deeper adult voice.<br />
<br />
He slowly sneaked toward Nick and stood in front of him for a moment admiring the body his friend was ashamed of. Nick looked good, really good! He was covered by a blanket but it didn&#39;t hide at all Nick&#39;s prominent muscles, his big feet and... his bulge.<br />
<br />
Riley was enjoying the sight, but he was curious. He needed to see more! Slowly and very carefully, he started to pull the blanket down. Inch by inch, Nick&#39;s naked body was getting exposed. Those muscles like marble, the dense forest on each inch of skin and, of course, the second most amazing dick that Riley has seen in his life.<br />
<br />
He stood there watching it for a while. Noticing how it moved from side to side with each movement that Nick made. He didn&#39;t understand why he felt so attracted to it but it was fascinating. Without noticing it, he had started to rub his own dick until it was rock hard and pointing directly to the sleeping guy.<br />
<br />
When his arousal was so big that was breathing with difficult. He quickly but firmly took Nick&#39;s dick with a hand and started to wank both cocks at the same time. Nick didn&#39;t wake up, instead it seemed that he was enjoying it. His dick quickly got rock hard as well. Riley could feel veins popping out on his friend&#39;s warm cock.<br />
<br />
He kept doing it for several minutes. Moaning so loud that it was miracle that Nick didn&#39;t wake up. Riley occasionally made contact between both dicks comparing their sizes and thicknesses. Riley was cut, so he was fascinated with Nick&#39;s foreskin. How it was getting tighter and tighter until it moved back and Nick&#39;s fat purple mushroom head was totally exposed. That&#39;s how natural dicks look? He wondered as he put his thumb on Nick&#39;s peehole and played with the precum that was dripping from it.<br />
<br />
Nick had stopped snoring. He was moaning instead. Riley wondered what was his friend dreaming. Are his dreams childish or more mature? That was turning him on until he finally climaxed on his friend&#39;s hairy chest. Perhaps it was stimulating for Nick because he also shot his load and it fell on his chest too. He has a complete mess on there. Riley thought that it wasn&#39;t a good idea trying to cover him back with the blanket. So, instead, he went to his own bed, got covered by his blanket and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Before he turned the lights off, he glanced one last time to his friend. Nick was naked and covered in a lot of cum. With his arms above his head, his hairy armpits were on display and one of his thick legs had fallen off the bed. His fat uncircumcised cock was resting on that leg but the foreskin was still pulled down, so the purple glossy mushroom was dripping to the floor. Riley smiled because he hadn&#39;t expected to see his friend looking like this, but he liked it.</p>
