<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Terry lingered in that odd twilight state, dimly aware of her surroundings and free of concern as her mind slowly came back <br />
online. She felt absolutely wonderful. She was warm, she was comfortable, she had her arms wrapped around someone with a wonderful smell. <br />
They'd fallen asleep like that after a night of lovemaking, her and Wendy... no, wait-<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes as Tim began kissing his way up her neck. &quot;Sleep well?&quot; he asked as he reached her surprisingly sensitive ear. Terry's first <br />
impulse was to shove him away in shock. Tired and aroused as she still was though, she stopped herself. At this point she wouldn't be stopping <br />
herself from crossing the line. She was starting to recall just how stridently it had been crossed last night. She really needed some time to <br />
reflect on all this but... she was getting entirely too worked up for that sort of soul searching. It could wait for a few more minutes... or maybe <br />
sometime after lunch...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The nice thing about going back to the park, thought Katie, was how little she'd have to pack. From the sound of things, she didn't have to <br />
worry about not being rehired. With how much her reluctance to go about 'in the fur' her first time out, she was surprised she was apparently <br />
Harry's first choice for a rehire. How much had things changed over there?<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
If there was one thing James had going for this plan, it was time. He still had plenty of time off from work, and nobody was expecting to bump <br />
into him anywhere. All he had to do was work out how to do the whole fake ID thing, drum up a resume... come to think of it, he might know a <br />
guy for that. Well, he knew someone who could help hide someone's IP if they got banned from an online game, and used to brag about how he <br />
could hijack anyone's account. If it wasn't in his skill set, he'd know a guy who knew a guy...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Eventually, Terry made her way out of the warrens, still a bit weak in the knees, and took a bit of a walk, trying to clear her head. That... had <br />
happened. Several times. At one point Tim had even switched off with some other guy whose name she hadn't even caught. For someone who <br />
had no intention of ever being a woman, she certainly seemed to have... caught on quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so... Day 3,&quot; she said, pausing for a moment to consider how she was going to continue. &quot;I've... confirmed that all of the instincts that <br />
come with this body are equally hard to ignore. The minute I found myself in the company of my own kind...&quot; She stopped herself for a <br />
moment. Her own kind? Well, she couldn't very well say 'these creatures' or something, everyone here was as human as she was, normally. Still, <br />
the term made her feel a bit self-conscious. Come to think of it, this was a bad line of thought to pursue out loud, seeing how often she'd been <br />
interrupted lately. &quot;I've found myself doing things I would never normally consider. Out here on my own though, I still feel like myself, so far <br />
anyway...&quot; ... well, maybe not entirely the same. &quot;I'm still fairly confident that if I had to leave today, I'd have no problem leaving.&quot; Well... she'd <br />
need to say a few goodbyes... have one last hurrah with Tim. &quot;I'm fairly confident things would get back to normal soon enough too. I mean, <br />
there's such a world of difference between everything in here and out there, this would probably just fade to feeling like some crazy dream.&quot; <br />
That's how things were starting to feel now, really. She remembered her normal life, but it was a little hard to picture certain aspects. Reaching <br />
for her wallet in a pocket, putting on a hat, little things like that. &quot;So... things... like this are a bit different, but...&quot; She was having a hard time <br />
comparing her experience with Tim to Wendy. Last night had been so unexpected, and this morning things still felt so new, and she was so <br />
filled with anxiety... she'd have to remember to take a critical view next time, really compare and contrast the sensations... maybe it would be <br />
best to do that now, while the thought was still fresh in her mind...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jeremy gave a resigned skyward glance as he went to confront this unruly mob of new stags. He was used to having the respect of all the deer <br />
in the park, but what had he really done to earn it? Really, all this &quot;Lord Jeremy&quot; business was the result of getting lucky in a fight with a few <br />
oversexed punks. He'd learned a lot about responsibility since. He'd had to, with a wife and child now, but as far as really 'speaking for the <br />
herd' went, it was really just a ceremonial title. Here went nothing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I know you all think this is just some sort of big party. 'Spring break' or a midlife crisis or whatever brings you here, but all these does <br />
you've been harassing are part of my herd, and as long as I have any say in it, you will treat them with respect, or you can get the hell out of <br />
this park!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; countered Chad, taking a break from doing chin-ups on a sturdy tree branch. &quot;Well my brothers here are all part of MY herd, and we <br />
sure as hell don't recall after swearing any sort of oath of fealty to some 'lord of the deer.' But you know, if you do want to tell us what we can <br />
and cannot do, you are more than welcome to compete with us here. Ten days from now, we're working out who's top stag. You know the real <br />
ones compete to see who's alpha every year! Something about the older stags getting all old and weak, needing to be replaced!&quot; His cronies all <br />
began to laugh.<br />
<br />
Jeremy considered rushing at him then and there. He'd come out as champion last spring, he could handle this punk. Probably not the whole <br />
gang at once though. &quot;Look, all I'm asking for here is for you to show a little common decency. It's not a game. If I hear any of you are <br />
harassing any of the does in this park, I'm coming back for more than a warning.&quot; He was sure to turn his back and start walking off before the <br />
inevitable retort. At least none of them had been bothering Latecia. Not yet.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
A few days later, James found himself in a waiting room. There really had been less to it than he'd anticipated. His friend was better connected <br />
than he'd realized, to the degree where he really did not want to know what sort of people usually paid him for this sort of thing. The big catch <br />
of course is the money he'd be earning here would end up in his account, but in a way that was better than paying up front. He'd paid through <br />
the nose his first time here, and didn't have the cash on hand. Who cares if he was getting overcharged anyway, when he was just coming for <br />
the lifestyle experience?<br />
<br />
The references on his fraudulent resume had checked out, and he didn't run into anyone in the registration area he recognized. Even if he had, <br />
the park had so many guests coming and going these days they probably wouldn't recognize him even without the shaved head, the beard. He <br />
was glad he'd skipped the colored contacts when he was handed a box for any small personal belongings. He was basically in the clear at this <br />
point. His paperwork all checked out, and his contact knew someone in a medical lab that even provided a &quot;verified&quot; DNA sample (he wasn't <br />
going to ask where that came from either) for the park to keep on file if he flunked out of the training program. That might have been overkill. <br />
Odds were they never checked that against a database, just it on a shelf with your name and all. All he had to do now was remember to answer <br />
to the name he'd applied with. It was one he used a variation on any time he needed to anonymously troll someone so he wasn't likely to <br />
forget. Ooh, there they were calling it.<br />
<br />
He stepped into the changing room, removed his clothes, and looked at the familiar touch screen. Not quite the same interface for new hires as <br />
the one for guests. Husky was already locked in as the species of course, and most of the other settings were fixed to make sure all the huskies <br />
were built right of they had to get violent with a guest. Damn, this was all about where he'd had it set last time. Limited options on fur color <br />
too, although at least he could go with a lighter color for the markings. Still, there was really only one setting that he was sure would keep him <br />
anonymous. His finger hovered over the screen for a moment before begrudgingly hitting &quot;Female.&quot; Screw it. They'd let him fix that later once <br />
he was well enough established. That no alterations rule wouldn't apply to staff, obviously.<br />
<br />
He winced a bit as the transformation started. Goodbye pudgy gut, goodbye receding hairline. Goodbye penis, sorry you had to take one for the <br />
team on this. Goodbye James Gorman for that matter... but welcome back snout tail, and fur. Wow, that was a light shade! All the sex-changing <br />
types picked new names for themselves didn't they? Maybe she'd just run with Goldie. She stepped out to join the other cadets, feeling a bit off, <br />
but glad to be back inside. She knew she couldn't be the Lone Wolf again, but she was confident she could be a good little dog. It wasn't about <br />
which team you played for, just good to be back in the game.</p>
