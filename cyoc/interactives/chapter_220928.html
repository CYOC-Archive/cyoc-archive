<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Rick and Emily were ready to take the photo Rick looked up and saw they were in the History section. At first he thought that would be boring but it could be fun they became something cool like Vikings or Knights. Easy to say he got his wish.....sort of?<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Rok felt strange as he scratched his beard. Only to realize that he never had a beard before and soon came too as Rick. Rick snapped out of whatever trance he was in only to discover he was wearing nothing but a fur pelt hung from his left shoulder covering down to his private area. His red hair grew big and ragged as well as his chest hair. In fact, his arms, legs,and feet were harrier too. His body seemed to be buffer as well as his muscles tightened.He studd more slouched than usually as he released he had a culb in his hand. All this strange things were answered as he looked down at the book store floor to find a book that said &quot;Early humans: Homo erectus area&quot; <br />
Which met only one thing Rick had turned into a caveman! &quot;O Shit.&quot; He whispered as he then realized that he didn&#39;t sound like a caveman for a sec. But he remembered that they turned on awareness so he was still in control though his mind was yearning to speak in a primitive tongue. Rick was relieved that Emily put that option on the camera.....Wait a minute WHERE&#39;S EMILY!? On a another note, WHERE WAS THE CAMERA!?! Rick was sure she was standing right next to him or at least he thought so? As he started to look around  he didn&#39;t she a trace of her anywhere. He feared that she freaked out and went into the main mall area. Though he didn&#39;t know how people would react but he had to find her. He took two steps forward until a sharp pain from his stopped him from going any further as he started to black out. <br />
<br />
As he was starting to come too, her could here a faint voice saying <br />
&quot;Rok....Rok.....ROK.... ROK! &quot;<br />
As he jumped up in fear until he saw someone familiar. &quot;EMUG?!?....I mean Emily?&quot; Before him stud a Stong but average height cavewoman that was Emily . Her waist was covered in a white pelt with a red fur pelt covering her breaststroke. Her brunette hair was long and wild like Rick&#39;s and when way past her shoulders. Once again he noticed her muscles as she looked a bit buffer than before. But also like he she was kinda slouched as she also had think hair on her arms, legs, and feet. The only diffent thing he noticed was that she had a unibrow. &quot;Nice Uni.&quot; Rick joked Emily saying back with a smerk &quot;You too baby!&quot; Rick felt his on his head too as he said &quot;Are you ok? Where were you? Hell, were are we and where is the cam-&quot; She came up close to him and kissed him on the lips trying to calm him down. After there release. She stood back and told him everything  &quot;So, after the camera flased I found myself in this place but it was dark.&quot;<br />
&quot;Once the lights came on I realized that this was one of the old Janitors closets in the store.&quot; After remembering who I was I snuck out to look for you and once I saw you running I realized I had a club to and well....&quot; <br />
&quot;So you hit me?&quot; Rick repied. <br />
&quot;Yes but if I didn&#39;t know if you were gonna go &quot;Unga Bunga&quot; in the mall so I had to.&quot; <br />
Rick looked down and said &quot; I was actually going to look for you. I guess I thought the same.&quot; He then hugged Emily as the cavecouple took a moment to embrace each others new body&#39;s. <br />
This led Rick to remember &quot;WAIT the camera is still missing! How are we gonna change back?&quot; <br />
&quot;Easy tiger.&quot; Emily blinks as she walked over to grab the camera.<br />
&quot;O thank God! NOW we just need to go home and...&quot; Rick stopped as Emily said &quot;Yeah about that. I was thinking and if we didn&#39;t? Like just for now?&quot; <br />
Rick was confused &quot;What do you mean? How can we go around a mall like this?&quot;<br />
Emily smerked &quot;Well what if they were?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uga?&quot; Rick replied <br />
&quot;While you were out I was thinking,  if we could turn the camera to Setting 3, we could turn people in here into cavepeople!&quot; Emily said<br />
Rick was confused and questioned &quot; What?! I mean.....that we would be kinda cool....but, no! I don&#39;t think everyone in the mall would like us if we they found out they cavepeople. &quot; <br />
Emily replied &quot;Not unless they are aware, if we take pictures of them and do that they would be too stupid to know. Plus we could rule them like tribe, we have some sort of primal thing in are heads but we can control it. We could have a night where we live like a king and queen of the Stonge Age!&quot; <br />
Rick amazed on how much she smeed to like it. The crazy thing was he was starting to as well. <br />
&quot;I know this isn&#39;t how I thought this would go but maybe it could still be fun for both of us. So what do you say, Rok?&quot; Emily said with a wink and smile. Rick moved towards her and lifted her up bridal style with his new strength and said to her<br />
&quot;So how do we start our tribe Emug?&quot;</p>
