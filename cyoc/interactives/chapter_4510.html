<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[My thanks to the good &quot;Doctor&quot; for his fine contributions to this story line!]<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooooo!&quot; Rais screamed in anger.  His attempt to have his giant Tiger attack his brother had failed totally.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God, Rais!  You actually tried to kill me!  ME!  Your own brother.  I knew you were sick and twisted but it's more than that, isn't it?  You're EVIL!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rais just continued to kick and scream, a child having a temper tantrum.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked about, his mind so cloudy he could barely grasp what was happening.  He saw the beautiful, naked, dark skinned little boy who he loved, his &quot;master,&quot; jumping up and down, screaming and crying and rolling on the floor in childish anger.  He felt Iqbal, the adult brother, 22, handsome, muscular, holding him like the helpless kitten he was.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to do something, but couldn't think what.  He knew Iqbal was trying to help him, to make things the way it was, the way he was supposed to be.  He felt all his hope was with Iqbal, but he also felt the power of the charm Rais had put on him, compelling him to love and desire his magically endowed roomate.  But for now, Jeff was just a tiger-kitten, feeling very confused by all the spells that had been done to him.  Like a dream, he wasn't sure who he should REALLY be right now.  He just wanted Iqbal to &quot;make it all better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Rais, but this has gone to far!  Way to far!&quot;<br />
<br />
Iqbal set Jeff down on the bed next to the other black kitten he'd brough originally, who'd curled up and watched all of this with complete disinterest.<br />
<br />
Iqbal moved toward his little brother and picked him up the tantruming child.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid THIS time you'd going to have to endure a much more severe punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rais looked paniced.  Instantly he began shouting all kinds of strange words at his brother, obviously trying to make some kind of spell on him, but what?  Iqbal seemed unaffected, when suddenly, there was a sudden shaking on Iqbal's part, but after a moment, he seemed to shake it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what you think you're trying to do, what spell you think you're trying to cast, but you know I'm immune to any charm you try.&quot;<br />
<br />
He put the child down on the bed next to his transformed and regressed 19 year old roomate, Jeff, the helpless tiger kitten.  &quot;But now, I'm sorry Rais, I think it's too dangerous to keep you like this.  I'm going to regress you back to a baby so you can't speak and I can safely get you back to mom and dad to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOO!&quot; Rais cried, but for some reason, Jeff thought, he didn't seem all THAT concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, but you've left me no choice.  This may cause you to forget things, for awhile, as you're brought back into infancy, but that's the only way to keep you safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Iqbal raised his hands to cast the spell as Rais recoiled in fear.  &quot;Regressario Maxiumus!&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Iqbal FLEW backwards as if he'd been SLAMED by an invidible force.  He landed on the floor with a confused look on his face as Rais giggled!<br />
<br />
The look of fear in his eye told that Iqbal knew something was very wrong!<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?  Why aren't you changing!?  Rais!?  What did you do to me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The naked little sprite who was the little brother jumped from the bed giggling and stood over Iqbal.  &quot;you bad boy ick-baw!&quot;<br />
<br />
Iqbal looked at himself, he could feel himself changing, his clothes getting looser.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap,&quot; he said, watching himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn't, you didn't!  There's no way you... CRAP!  You put a REFLECTIVE spell on me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rais just nodded, giggling.<br />
<br />
From the bed Jeff watched confused.  Iqbal was his only hope of getting back to his normal, 19 year old human self, and now something had gone terribly wrong, he could see that.  Now Iqbal was was changing rapidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reducio altomis!&quot; Iqbal shouted, obviously trying to cancel the effects of his own regression spell, but it didn't work.<br />
<br />
&quot;You goona be widdler than ME now Ick-baw!  You twied to make me a widdle baby, but you gonna be widdle-widdle baby now!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true!  Iqbal was loosing age rapidly, slipping past puberty, his clothes growing so big on him there was no way they could stay on.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Rais!  Damnit!&quot; he shouted as he tried to get to his feet.<br />
<br />
Rais started singing in a taunting, little kid sing-song, &quot;Ick-baw ith a baaaa--by, Ick-baw ith a baaa-by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP IT!&quot; Iqbal shouted childishly as he struggled out of his own oversized clothes to get to his feet.  He was now quite pre-adolescent as his own spell transformed him rapidly.  Although he retained who he was and all his knowledge inside his head, he couldn't stop acting and reacting emotionally and verbally like a child and he knew, by his own spell, he'd lose all of it soon!<br />
<br />
Iqbal ran toward his brother. &quot;Stop it, I'm not widdle, I'm the big bwother!&quot;  he shouted, although it was obvious he was getting younger very fast now.  He couldn't have been more than seven or eight, and dropping fast!<br />
<br />
Suddenly Iqbal grabbed his giggling little brother and the two naked children fell to the floor, rolling around on one another, wrestling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it stop!!!&quot; Iqbal cried as he pinned his still slightly smaller brother to the floor.  &quot;Make it stop or I'll tell mommy!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Rais just giggled as they continued to struggle.  Iqbal held the advantage in size and age when it started, but the situation quickly changed.  Within moments Iqbal was barely three and Rais, at four years old, was suddenly the &quot;big brother&quot; of the two, and the stronger one.  He spun around and pinned little Iqbal to the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ick-baw is a baaa-by, Ick-baw ith a baaa-by&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!&quot; Iqbal shouted, starting to get tears in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched it all from his place on the bed, unable to move, stunned as Iqbal, who had moments earlier been so adult, so totally in control, regressed back to a two year old before his eyes, crying and pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it stop!&quot; he shouted, his speech becoming more and more childish with each moment as Rais laughed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rais let go. Iqbal tried to stand, toddling uneasily onto shaky legs.  He looked down at himself in shock.  His muscular body was now soft, pudgy, hairless and diminuative.  Unable to stop the tears in his eyes, he looked up in anger at his brother and tried to take a step toward him.  As he did he suddenly tettered and fell on to his own little bottom, no longer able to walk.  Iqbal began to cry uncontrollably, rubbing his eye with a balled up little fist as Rais just laughed at him.<br />
<br />
Now all Iqbal could do was think of getting away.  Iqbal turned to try and flee for the door, but all he could do was to crawl, infant like, knowing inside his situation was growing ever more helpless.<br />
<br />
Before he was halfway there he was unable to crawl at all.  Instead, he finally rolled onto his back and just lay there, a naked, bawling baby kicking his legs in the air helplessly.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his hear sink.  Dispite the spell he had that made him attracted to Rais he knew Iqbal had been his only hope of returning to normal.  Now the big strong man was a crying infant!<br />
<br />
Rais walked over to his helpless infant brother and stood over him smugly, giggling at his situation.<br />
<br />
For a moment Iqbal looked at Rais with an angry look in his eye, a defiant gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye bye, Ick-baw!&quot; Rais said smugly, knowing the last was coming.  And it did.<br />
<br />
Within moments, the look in baby-Iqbals eyes faded to a blank baby stare, and he began to gurgle.  His little infant weewee suddenly erupted a fountain of warm baby pee and the man who had been 22 years old moment ago, was now nothing but an infant wetting himself to the amusement of his four year old brother.<br />
<br />
Still giggling, the beautiful but wicked, dark skined Rais turned toward his roomate, Jeff, now a helpless tiger kitten on the bed.<br />
<br />
Jeff had watched all this, unable to move or know what to do, his mind clouded and confused by Rais' spells.  Now he knew his chances of getting back to normal were slim, as the magical boy who was his roomate was moving toward him again, with a new and sinister gleam in his little boy eyes.</p>
