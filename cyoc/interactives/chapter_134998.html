<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s transform real girls next!&quot; said Bunny, &quot;As fun as it is turning dumb men into hot babes, I wanna get nasty with some real women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can work on that now. Jojo certainly doesn&#39;t need our help now,&quot; said Andrea, looking at the former Jason who was busy fondling her huge breasts. &quot;Any suggestions of where to start?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea looked thoughtful before a wicked gleam entered her eyes. &quot;I know just the place,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Everyone in the neighborhood knew about Susan, the single mom who worked so hard to raise her daughter, Violet, after her father left them. But mostly, everyone in the neighborhood remembered what a sweet girl Violet used to be until recent years. Violet was not going through her teen years well and had gone full goth. She was becoming far more than her poor mother can handle and the neighbors have heard them arguing rather frequently now. They were the perfect pair for Andrea and Bunny to start their infection.<br />
<br />
Andrea and Bunny headed over to Susan&#39;s house and rang the doorbell. Susan herself answered the door. The recent years haven&#39;t been good for her. She looked haggard, tired, her brown hair in a mess and turning premature grey, bags under her eyes. She was wearing a beige turtleneck and sweatpants. &quot;Excuse me, but I&#39;m busy with dinner and-&quot; started Susan before noticing the bikini-clad women in front of her. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some concerned neighbors,&quot; said Andrea as she and Bunny walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. What did Violet do this time?&quot; asked Susan with a groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing. But I&#39;d like to talk to her,&quot; said Bunny.<br />
<br />
Susan probably wouldn&#39;t have let a strange woman go talk to her daughter alone, but her work-numbed mind and the dykes&#39; hypnotic pheromones made her easier to persuade. &quot;She&#39;s upstairs right now,&quot; said Susan, pointing to the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, we&#39;ll be down in a few minutes,&quot; said Bunny as she went up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Susan would have questioned the &#39;we&#39; part, but Andrea said, &quot;You look awful. When was the last time you did something for yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; started Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know exactly what you need,&quot; said Andrea, walking Susan over to an easy chair, &quot;A nice calming massage.&quot; She sneaked her hands under Susan&#39;s turtleneck and started massaging her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t- Ooh...that feels nice...&quot; said Susan, melting under Andrea&#39;s touch. She felt so much tension leaving her body just from this woman&#39;s gentle touch. She hadn&#39;t much time to find another husband. And every time she found a man with potential, Violet did something to sabotage it. Maybe she had been looking in the wrong direction. Maybe another woman would make her life more complete.<br />
<br />
Andrea watched with interest as Susan changed. The worry lines and bags under her eyes melted away, making her look much younger already. Her hair lost its grey and became extra curly. Andrea could feel Susan&#39;s body subtly changing under her hands. &quot;It would be more relaxing if you didn&#39;t have so many clothes on,&quot; she said. With that, she started pulling up Susan&#39;s turtleneck.<br />
<br />
Susan didn&#39;t protest as Andrea took her top off. Standing up, she slipped the sweatpants from her waist. Looking down at herself, she saw a younger, toned body, unlike the one she had when she was young. She didn&#39;t remember being so stacked, her breasts grown to D-cups. She also saw that her bra and panties were changing color and texture, becoming a sky blue bikini set.<br />
<br />
Andrea didn&#39;t waste time in crouching down in front of Susan, pulling her bikini crotch down to reveal the hairless pussy. &quot;Now about making dinner...&quot; purred Andrea before she started licking at Susan&#39;s slit. Susan moaned as she completely gave over to the Bikini Dyke Plague.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Bunny had gone up the stairs to Violet&#39;s room. It was pretty unmistakable, with all the black posters hanged on the walls and the blinds closed. Violet was lying on her bed in a funk, dressed all in black. Her hair was cut short and died black, with violet streaks in it. She wore heavy black makeup and had a nose plug. Personally, Bunny thought it made her look more punk than goth.<br />
<br />
Violet glared at the strange woman entering her room and asked, &quot;Who are you and why should I care?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear you&#39;ve got some issues with your mother,&quot; said Bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;So? You gonna tell me I should try to appreciate her more?&quot; asked Violet with a scoff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she&#39;ll understand you more if you did something really outrageous,&quot; said Bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; asked Violet.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about...kissing a girl?&quot; asked Bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried that once, didn&#39;t really feel anything,&quot; said Violet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was she as hot as me?&quot; asked Bunny, posing her sexy body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no. Never met a girl who&#39;s hot as you,&quot; said Violet.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you wouldn&#39;t mind kissing me?&quot; asked Bunny coyly.<br />
<br />
The situation was really weird for Violet, but at the same time she felt pulled towards this mysterious woman. &quot;Yeah, ok,&quot; she said. Sitting up on her bed, Violet made room for Bunny to sit down. Almost before she knew it, Bunny was french-kissing her. Violet could taste something in her mouth that wasn&#39;t spit. Something salty. But pretty quickly the feeling of pleasure overwrote any other concern.<br />
<br />
The kissing only stopped when Violet felt her clothes getting too tight. She broke off and looked down at herself, noticing her body was bigger and curvier than she remembered. &quot;Let me help you with that,&quot; said Bunny, yanking on Violet&#39;s shirt. It tore apart too easily, revealing a sky blue bikini top that Violet didn&#39;t remember putting on. But then Bunny started tearing off the rest of Violet&#39;s clothes, revealing a toned, sexy adult body underneath. Before long, Violet was down to just her bikini set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel...so...&quot; moaned Violet. Her head started changing, losing the roundness of childhood. Her black hair grew longer, the violet streaks becoming more vibrant. Her lips plumped up as her face became more mature, the makeup she wore becoming less goth and more sexy. &quot;So good...&quot; moaned Violet, as a brand new appreciation for the female body appeared in her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna show your mom how good you feel?&quot; asked Bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom?&quot; asked Violet. She briefly wondered what her mom would think about her, but then she felt a strong desire to see her mother&#39;s reaction. &quot;Oh, yes I do,&quot; she purred.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Bunny and Violet walked downstairs to find Andrea eating out Susan. The two blinked as they looked at each other. Susan probably should have been concerned that her teenage daughter now looked to be in her 20&#39;s, but she was more interested in how her body had developed so sexily, especially her C-cup breasts. Violet might have wondered why her mom looked young enough to be her older sister, but the fact that she was so sexy now too precedence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good, Violet,&quot; said Susan in a flirtatious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look awesome too, Mom,&quot; said Violet, &quot;I really like your tits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like them too,&quot; said Susan as she hefted up her boobs. Reaching back, she untied her bikini, allowing her boobs to bounce free. &quot;Remember how you used to like sucking on them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Violet didn&#39;t need further encouragement. She walked over to her mother and latched her mouth over one nipple. Susan moaned huskily before reached down to grope her daughter&#39;s own boobs. Violet moaned as Susan removed her bikini top. Before long, the two of them were on the floor, scissoring each other with wild abandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they were a good start,&quot; said Andrea. It was hard to believe the two lesbians grinding against each other were mother and daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you so,&quot; said Bunny before slinking a hand into Andrea&#39;s bikini bottom, &quot;You want to scissor too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I ever,&quot; said Andrea as she pulled at Bunny&#39;s bikini bottom.</p>
