<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty quickly began scanning the room looking for Eileen&#39;s discarded robe. Finding it he awkwardly handed it to the now young girl. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Eileen said with a kind smile. Ty smiled sheepishly before turning around to allow the girl to dress. Gathering his own clothes Ty&#39;s mind raced as he thought about what had just happened.<br />
<br />
He had just lost his virginity, which had been amazing, but it had been with the only adult who had ever cared for him. These powers he possessed had transformed this woman. He had watched as she had slowly become younger going from a mature woman of 40 to the child of 10. The whole idea of it was messing with his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can turn around again Ty,&quot; Eileen called. &quot;I&#39;m decent.&quot; Ty turned slowly and was even more bewildered by what he saw. Eileen had been average height for a woman, around 5&#39;6&quot; or 5&#39;7&quot;. Ty was small for his age meaning he stood about shoulder high to her, a difference of about 3 or 4 inches. That size difference was now totally reversed. Eileen was at least a foot shorter now.The top of her head coming to Ty&#39;s shoulders. The robe, which had rested just below her knees, now pooled around her feet. Ty could see Eileen kicking at the robe he small toes poking out from underneath. The sleeves of her robe now went several inches past her hands completely engulfing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was interesting,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Not the usual way I spend my mornings.&quot; Ty smirked sheepishly and gave an embarrassed laugh. &quot;Yea well it was, uhh, interesting for me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen smiled warmly as she looked up at Ty. &quot;Well as much as I enjoyed myself I should really go clean up and take a shower.&quot; Eileen said as she continued to adjust her robe. &quot;Oh okay,&quot; Ty said. &quot;You want me to change you back then?&quot; Eileen paused as she thought about it for a moment. &quot;No that&#39;s okay,&quot; she said thoughtfully. &quot;I kind of want to stay like this for a minute. Besides being this small I&#39;ll probably use less soap.&quot; Eileen giggled as she turned to go upstairs. &quot;Why don&#39;t you watch t.v. for a bit,&quot; she said as she hiked the robe up. &quot; I shouldn&#39;t be too long. Besides I really want to know how this happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded and smiled as Eileen trudged upstairs in her over sized robe. Having already dressed Ty sat on the couch and began to flick through channels. The whole thing was still surreal. Yes he had a bit of a crush on Eileen and had fantasized about being with Eileen but that&#39;s all they were, fantasies. Could he have made Eileen more susceptible to being with him? Also now Eileen was a child of 10. He had not intended on making her that young but he had to admit watching her regress had been fascinating. If Eileen hadn&#39;t said anything how young would she have become? Finally now that he had lost his virginity to Eileen how would their relationship be affected. Eileen had always been a confidant, someone Ty could go to when things got to hard at home. Now that their relationship had taken a romantic turn, would things change?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow you look deep in thought,&quot; Eileen said. Ty rubbed his eyes and looked towards the stairs. Eileen had finished showering and found some clothing that fit her. The young girl now wore an orange sleeveless shirt with a pair of grey sweat shorts. Her ebony hair, still wet, hung down past her shoulders giving her an even more youthful appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hi Eileen,&quot; Ty called. &quot;Was kinda lost in thought.&quot; Eileen giggled. &quot;I could see that. Sorry it took me so long, it took me awhile to find some clothes that fit. Thankfully Becca had some old clothes in her closet so I don&#39;t have to walk around in oversized clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled. &quot;I didn&#39;t seem that long to me. Was just, thinking, about everything that happened. Didn&#39;t even notice how much time had passed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen smiled as she walked towards the couch to sit down. Hopping on to the couch a look of amazement crossed her face as she looked down at her tiny bare feet. &quot;Everything okay?&quot; Ty asked. Eileen smiled. &quot;Yea, it&#39;s just, my feet don&#39;t reach the ground anymore. I didn&#39;t realize how small I had gotten. Really makes it sink in that I&#39;m just a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled as he looked down at Eileen&#39;s feet. Sure enough the young girls toes hovered several inches above the floor. Not wanting Eileen to feel uncomfortable he carefully grabbed her ankles, placing her feet on his lap. &quot;Does that help?&quot; He asked. Eileen smiled as she settled herself against the arm of the couch. &quot;Surprisingly yeah,&quot; she said. Ty smiled before playfully tickling her feet., Eileen giggled gazing at Ty with a look of warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you feel Eileen,&quot; he asked. &quot;You were really excited about everything when we were in the kitchen.&quot;  Eileen blushed and smiled before longingly looking at Ty. &quot;Yea got a bit carried away in there,&quot; she said, &quot;Guess my hormones were running a little wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded. &quot;And what about now?&quot; A bemused look came across Eileen&#39;s face as she shyly looked at Ty. &quot;It&#39;s weird,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m just a child now but everything from before, well it kinda scares me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Ty asked with concern. Eileen blushed. &quot;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s weird, I know what we did was exciting and pleasurable but the idea of actually, well, doing that. It, it kinda scares me. I, I really feel more and more like a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked over the young girl with a look of concern. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what to say,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I mean it wasn&#39;t my intention to make you feel like a kid.&quot;  Eileen smiled and took Ty&#39;s hand in hers, marveling at how much smaller her hand was than his. &quot;No Ty you didn&#39;t do anything wrong,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s actually good I mean I was a bit wild back there. It&#39;s totally out of character for me. Now without all the hormones raging I feel like myself, except.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except what?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Except I still kind of have feelings for you. Except there different now. Now, well now I feel like a kid with a crush. You understand what I&#39;m saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and nodded. &quot;Yea I get it,&quot; he said with laugh. &quot;You got a crush on me. Like I&#39;m a member of a boy band.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen giggled and let out a girlish sigh. &quot;Yea I guess,&quot; she said shyly her cheeks blushing fiercely. &quot;You, you still like me though right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Ty said warmly squeezing Eileen&#39;s hand. &quot;You one of my most favorite people in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen giggled and and gave Ty a quick hug before returning to her position on the couch. &quot;So what should we do now,&quot; she asked as she wiggled her toes. Ty smiled as he again tickled her feet. &quot;Not quite sure, lets see what happens.&quot;</p>
