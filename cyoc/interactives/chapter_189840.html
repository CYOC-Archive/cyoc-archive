<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now going by the name of Jonas he was brown haired, six foot 2, white and jail house strong. He knew that the effects of giving that gay guy a blowjob would wear off after a period of time so he went around to the local McDonald&#39;s. There was a girl he knew from his class, she brow haired beauty with a nice rack and a cheerleader. It was fate, normally he would never have a chance but he was in the body of a full grown man. <br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s family had also broken up, her mom and her other younger sister were living in a rental house since her Dad had knocked up a younger woman. Her family was from some country where you were expected to have a job. He had caught her crying in the girl&#39;s toilets and he could sense that she was emotionally weak. Her rants on Instagram also showed not only which McDonald&#39;s she worked at but also that she was nearing breaking point.<br />
<br />
When he was his normal self he had no chance with her. However his new body plus her broken mental state gave him a chance. He booked a room at the local motel using a credit card he had stolen off of Travis and rented a car. He sat eating his meal when he left a note for her. He complemented her on her looks and asked her to join him when she got off shift.  <br />
<br />
It was a gamble, his stolen manhood would hold out or he would have to leave. He felt like a gambler betting every cent he owned on double or nothing. He ordered his third coke of the evening and just when he thought nothing had come through. Then he felt a post it note at the bottom of his coke:<br />
<br />
&quot;I get out in 30 mins. Meet me out the back by the dumpster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jonas picked her up and asked her if she wanted to talk as she seemed upset, she burst into tears about her Dad and her Mum and younger sister. He let her carry on as the tears she was crying was energy that she was losing and power that he was gaining over her. Soon they were kissing and he felt her hand in between his legs. He had wood.  <br />
<br />
Soon they were attacking each others clothes, her corporate tee shirt came off exposing sizeable breasts, Chris thought a solid B cup, in a lime green push up bra. She kicked off her shoes and work pants exposing matching lime green panties that had a black lacy trim and a little black bow. He let her unhook her bra as her breasts bounced with her body. She didn&#39;t disappoint, her breasts were handfuls but the nipples were like pencil erasers, pink with health.<br />
<br />
He ran a hand over her breast as if he were an expert.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; he purred at her.<br />
<br />
This is what she wanted, a man&#39;s affection. Whether her Daddy&#39;s or a classmate who was in the body of a grown adult male for the next two hours. Jonas flung back the sheets of the bed and stuck out a hand like she was royalty. This is exactly what she wanted. He guided her onto the bed and he did bother as she didn&#39;t ask about protection. <br />
<br />
Jonas gripped her hand as he laid her down on the bed. He then kissed her on the lips as she felt his erection hard against her pussy, likewise he could feel her nipples and breasts squished against his broad chest. Kissing her he ran a hand along her tight backside. Then she pushed against his chest, he was confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me until I scream.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
It was is if Jonas had been given a green light suddenly he was kissing her face, neck, breasts and then he thrust into her like a murder with a knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
The sheets he had pulled over them were riding down his ass. Jonas&#39; back rippled with muscles like a Greek God as he nailed her again. Groaning as he were going to burst from all the cum inside him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh my God! Oh!&quot;  Karen gasped <br />
<br />
Her head thrown back on the cheap pillow. Her legs wrapped around his tree trunk like legs as he both took her virginity and her problems from her. But the excess of testosterone was making Jonas even bigger and stronger. He wanted to cum but his felt unable to achieve it as he rose higher and higher. All that was to be seen of Karen was her delicate hands on his back and spread legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;NNNGGGHHH!&quot; he roared like a bull.<br />
<br />
Karen gave out a weak cry of pleasure, now only her legs could be seen. He collapsed onto her as Karen&#39;s hands slipped off his sweaty back and caught his armpits. But Jonas didn&#39;t come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
Like a worshiper testify to Jesus or something. But he kept going, pounding her into the mattress which squeaked and squealed in protest at the abuse it was suffering. The cheap wood started to collapse as he kept straining for a release. <br />
<br />
After about five minutes Jonas could feel the blockage starting to come loose as he slackened his grip on Karen&#39;s sixteen year old frame. She was broken and all she could mutter was a series of &quot;uh, uh, uh&quot;. Finally she could feel his penis, stuck in her like a steel baseball bat, start to twitch and spasm. As Jonas loosened his grip Karen&#39;s legs started to tighten around Jonas&#39; now nude body. <br />
<br />
&quot;GGGOOODDD!&quot; he bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah God&quot; she moaned as the red hot seed poured into her unprotected womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;GOD!&quot; he roared as he cumed again. <br />
<br />
Karen stiffened as the gave her a second blast of his red hot beef injection. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I needed that.&quot; she tried to gasp.<br />
<br />
Jonas looked stunned as he slowly rolled off of her as the weight of Jonas&#39; body was lifted her breasts bounced back into position. Karen was completely confused as to what happened with this man who has just fucked her without protection. As she rolled over with him her backside showed a pattern of bruising and even bleeding. Likewise her vagina was leaking blood as she tried to reach the edge of the bed. <br />
<br />
Her hair had been up in a bun with a hair net less than an hour before now it was soaked in sweat as she tried to get across the bed. She got to the edge of the bed and sat there for about a minute looking roof as she tried to get the sticky hair out of her eyes. With aching hands she reached for the bathrobe the motel supplied. There clothes were a tangle on the floor as she tried to find that her bra and panties had been stolen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh?&quot; she turned on Jonas to find him gone.<br />
<br />
Jonas has started to turn back into Chris. He was now a pasty white teenager that Karen would never touch on a normal day. He had taken her bra and panties as a trophy, but he found that it might. be something more powerful should he need to take on the guise of Karen at a later date.</p>
