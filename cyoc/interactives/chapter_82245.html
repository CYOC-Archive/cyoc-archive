<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle opened his mouth and said, &quot;You know, you are one hot ho, babe. And I'm just as hot now. We should fuck. <br />
Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached out - his hands had gotten huge, and his eyes were wandering over her body like she was something <br />
he could eat.  Jennifer wasn't fast enough to dodge the one hand that grabbed her arm, and before she could <br />
scream the other hand was over her mouth, as he shook his head.  She started to say &quot;Transfo--&quot; but he slapped <br />
her suddenly, and clamped down on her jaw. &quot;No, I like who I am. No more curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
She realized through the shock that he had completely accepted it, he wasn't struggling with his new identity <br />
now. It made her realize just how careless she had been, since with his reflexes, she would have to be far <br />
away before she could hit him with the curse again.  She also felt his hard body - and oh god his dick was <br />
almost freakishly big now, she could feel it half-hard and pressed against her - how would that feel?  If he <br />
raped her, it would kill her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, please, ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush up now, you don't want my Mom to hear us. She's a real Jesus Freak, she already thinks you're a slut. <br />
But a slut is just a ho who likes sex, and you like sex, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer's eyes were large with fear, and she shook her head. &quot;No,&quot; she said behind his hand. She knew she had <br />
to distract him but he had already moved his other hand around her back to reach under her shirt, expertly <br />
unfastening her bra. Apparently the curse had given him all the skills of the brainless testosterone-filled <br />
skater jock that she had envisioned, not just the athletic ones. And the confidence was terrifying and <br />
attractive as hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you want me,&quot; he said, &quot;All the hos do, it just takes one fuckin' ride on my board and they can't <br />
help it, they all want more. It ain't rape if you want it, babe, and I can make you feel so good, want it so <br />
hard...&quot;<br />
<br />
The hand that had unhooked her bra was now sliding, feeling red-hot, down her body, caressing her in a way <br />
that left a tingling pleasure behind.  Damnit, was this part of the curse? She hadn't SAID he would have the <br />
seductive skills he was showing, but he was even better at this than her ex-boyfriend Jim - the wrestling team <br />
captain.  And the slap hadn't really hurt, he had expertly controlled his strength, it just shocked the hell <br />
out of her.  Something about him smelled good too, and his hard muscles against her body - but she hated being <br />
trapped against the wall, his hand pressed across her mouth.  It changed from a silencing clamp to fingers <br />
stroking across her lips, and she resisted the urge to suck them into her mouth. Her nipples were starting to <br />
harden too.  This was too much, she had to stop.<br />
<br />
She tried to bite his hand, and he pulled it away, threatening to slap her again.  She felt fear burn through <br />
her, like poison.  &quot;No, Kyle,&quot; she said, &quot;We can't do this here. Your Mom would hear, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but where?  I gotta get off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't die in five minutes, right? We can, uh, walk to school and find a place in the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, babe, but I'm edgin' and the longer we go the less fun you're gonna have,&quot; Kyle said, the threat <br />
fading.  He didn't let go of her though, pulling her close and giving her a kiss that made her pulse race. <br />
Jennifer swore silently to herself.  He was not letting her get far enough away that she could safely speak <br />
the words of the curse, and fix this mess.  Kyle the unstoppable skater-rapist was definitely not the safe <br />
dumb easily manipulated boy-toy she had been half-thinking of.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, fasten your bra,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Mom will see it if you're unhooked.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt her face flush hot, again, and looked into the mirror. There wasn't even a handprint from the slap <br />
earlier.  Kyle leaned back against the door, one leg forward, thumbs hooked in his low-rider board-short <br />
pockets. His legs were muscled and ripped, short golden hairs sparkling in the light over his now-tan skin, <br />
and his brilliant dark-blue eyes were wandering over her body again, like he was thinking about what to do <br />
with it with those big, too-strong hands. His clothes hadn't fit him nearly this ... dammit, he was looking <br />
like sex incarnate again.  His tee-shirt was carefully just a bit too tight, riding up so that a ripped <br />
stretch of his apollo's-belt showed muscular curves that made her swallow hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK.&quot; She fastened the bra, knowing that with his reflexes she needed to be at least ten feet away before she <br />
could use the curse. If she could figure out how to do it without making things worse.<br />
<br />
He kissed her on the forehead, whispering, &quot;You are gonna come so hard you'll forget your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
She swallowed again, terrified. He reached around her shoulder, pulling her close, and picked up her pack with <br />
his other hand, effortlessly.  He opened the door.  &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had to fake a smile when Kyle's Mom - a definite Church Lady type, in her frowsy plaid knee-length dress <br />
and pearls, in the morning, glared at her from the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing in there with the door closed?&quot; the woman demanded, her face hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothin', Mom,&quot; Kyle started to say, but she knew he wouldn't be able to fool her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had gone in to wash my face, Mrs. Perkins, but I had lost a contact.  Kyle helped me find it, it had gotten <br />
onto the floor by the door. We had to close it so I could reach it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, next time, make sure an adult is present.  We don't want you compromised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Ma'am,&quot; Jennifer said. They escaped to the outside, Kyle effortlessly kicking up his skateboard on the <br />
way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was real smart, Jennifer,&quot; Kyle said, smiling - even his smile was sexy. &quot;I would not of thought of <br />
that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt ashamed for a moment. He would have, except for her. And the stupid was beginning to grate on her <br />
nerves.<br />
<br />
The walk to school wasn't that long, but it was incredibly frustrating. Kyle never let go of her, and he kept <br />
telling her what he wanted to do, and she kept finding her body trying to respond to it.</p>
