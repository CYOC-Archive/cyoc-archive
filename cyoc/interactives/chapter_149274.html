<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy half gulped as he looked to Mr. M. The male was easily larger than Jeremy, though that went without saying. While the overwhelming majority of Syntixisaurus Rex was from Tyrannosaurus, some of the component DNA in the hybrid species included DNA from theropods that were well smaller than Tyrannosaurus, like Carnotaurus. In this, while Heather and Tyra were a bit bigger than Jeremy, Rex was bigger than all of them. Mr. M, however, even looked to be a bit bigger than Rex, maybe not by much but still bigger.<br />
<br />
Jeremy also noted a few differences between Mr. M and Rex. For one thing, Mr. M&#39;s muzzle was far narrower. The skull and head widened a bit ad the back of the head, near where Mr. M&#39;s eyes were, which would allow for some degree of forward facing vision, but not enough for perfect depth perception, something that Rex clearly had as his eyes did face completely forward. Mr. M&#39;s muzzle was also more pointed at the front than rounded. Like Red, Mr. M was largely brown in coloration, but Rex was more of a solid brown with only his ventral side being a bit lighter and that was something that let his feathers and skin blend in together. <br />
<br />
Mr. M, however had a bit more coloration than that. The top of his muzzle and running over a pair of flat ridges above his eyes, that were smaller than Rex&#39;s and definitely smaller than Jeremy&#39;s, was an extremely dark brown, almost a brownish-black and this color seemed to then drift into a series of speckled spots that ran around Mr. M&#39;s neck and shoulders in what would look like stripes. This also seemed to solidify into a single dark brown coloration that ran down his arms leading to two four fingered, counting the thumb, hands. The background coloration to this was a slightly lighter shade of brown that was almost brighter than the darker brown coloration. His ventral side was a tone that looked like one had taken brown, gray, and white paint and mixed them together. And thanks to the white muscle shirt that Mr. M was wearing, Jeremy could see all of this. The biggest difference from Rex, though, was that Mr. M did not appear to have feathers, or at least if they were there, they were so fine that they couldn&#39;t be seen with the naked eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Mr. M gave a smile, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus is awesome and I&#39;ll look forward to impressing a female Carnosaur eventually... but I will help keep you in shape... and don&#39;t worry...&quot; He paused to lift his lips in a very confident/predatory smile revealing narrow blade-like teeth, which were also different from Rex&#39;s blunter and more robust teeth, &quot;Your bond mate will enjoy you much more when I&#39;m through with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy only gulped again as Mr. M chuckled and thought back on his conversion.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So you work for Horizon?&quot; am named Michael Mega asked as he followed after Rex through the Horizon hallways in Dino City with one of the present Horizon scientists leading the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;More of a partnership with Horizon,&quot; Rex answered, &quot;I&#39;m actually working directly with the state park that&#39;s to the north of Dino City with some of their educational programs. Things like the Acrocanthosaurus and sauropod trackway that was found there as well as other things that have made the site interesting from a paleontological perspective. Horizon has also helped with potentially expanding the facilities at the site to allow for examinations on new bones that may be discovered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re a paleontologist,&quot; Michael Mega surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with that,&quot; Rex smiled, &quot;You get to dig in the dirt and no one can complain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose...&quot; Michael Mega said slowly, &quot;though I never got into that... though... I&#39;ve always been a big guy... enjoyed working out... catching a lady&#39;s eye and so on. Though old age started catching up with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn&#39;t join Animalia earlier?&quot; the Horizon scientist wondered as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never really had that much interest in modern animals... they&#39;ve made fine pets... but as a kid, bigger was always better, and you can&#39;t get any bigger than a dinosaur,&quot; Michael Mega answered, &quot;so, when this city opened... I was willing to move in. As Carcharodontosaurus is one of the larger theropods out there... and likely battled Spinosaurus! Might even be enough to beat T Rex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex gave a heavy groan, &quot;By its size... maybe. However, you should note that Carnosaurs like Carcharodontosaurus can trace an at least indirect link to Theropods like Allosaurus in the Jurassic Period. At that time, the ancestors of Tyrannosaurus Rex were largely small and too small to be a threat to the larger Allosaurid and Megalosaurid theropods. And then the continents began to break up. North America, Europe and Asia moved more toward where they are now while South America, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica were much further south and separated from the northern hemisphere. It should be noted that this break up occurred before the specific Coelurosaurian ancestors of Tyrannosaurus could move into the southern hemisphere. There is some debate on the possibility of some Tyrannosaurids making it to Africa... but reports I&#39;ve seen have had that in dispute. Some say the specimens are more like the other Carnosaurs that were already there while others say they were Tyrannosaurids...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t the large Carnosaurs go extinct in North America, Europe, and Asia, though?&quot; Michael Mega asked, &quot;and I mean before T Rex appeared?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally yes, but there were large Carnosaurs in North America, Europe, and Asia in the early Cretaceous, the local theropod... Acrocanthosaurus was among them,&quot; Rex answered, &quot;and it&#39;s during this time frame that many of Tyrannosaurus&#39;s ancestors began to get bigger... possibly in order to deal with new prey that was also evolving. And this would at some point lead to some measure of conflict between the older Carnosaur species and the newer Tyrannosaur species. Which would mean that theropods like Acrocanthosaurus didn&#39;t just go extinct in North America and then the first Tyrannosaurs appeared. There had to be some measure of direct competition between the two groups for some time period. For if the only driving force was the presence of prey... because while the sauropods that animals like Acrocanthosaurus often hunted did decline... they didn&#39;t necessarily disappear. And the fact that there are records of Allosaurus hunting animals like Stegosaurus, there would be some evidence that Carnosaurs weren&#39;t just limited to preying on sauropods. They could tackle other prey... and by the late Cretaceous, there were other herbivorous dinosaurs that weren&#39;t armored or horned. And many of the Hadrosaurs would be built in a way that was similar to the Iguanodon relatives... like Ouranosaurus… that Carcharodontosaurus may have hunted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would mean that all animals that the Carnosaurs hunted didn&#39;t go extinct,&quot; Michael Mega said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would mean that in the northern hemisphere in the mid to late Cretaceous, Tyrannosaurids would outcompete the Carnosaurids on land,&quot; Rex nodded, &quot;Spinosaurus relatives may have continued... but that would then be for the same reasons that Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus was able to live alongside Carcharodontosaurus. They primarily hunted fish and thus didn&#39;t compete with the land based theropods. And I&#39;d even speculate that had sauropods not declined in the northern hemisphere as much as they did... it&#39;d be likely that a similar sort of sharing would take place. The Carnosaurs would hunt more of the sauropods while the Tyrannosaurs would hunt more of the armored and horned dinosaurs and thus cutting down on direct competition. But that sauropod decline did happen and thus the Carnosaurs in the northern hemisphere had to compete more with the Tyrannosaurids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Mega slowly accepted that as some line of reasoning, though it didn&#39;t change his personal interest in Carcharodontosaurus. It was still cool in that there were Theropods that were bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex. The paleontologist&#39;s explanation just made things interesting. He then followed along, occasionally glancing up to note how high the ceilings were and then looked back to Rex as a new question came to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if you&#39;re not working for Horizon... why are you here?&quot; Michael Mega asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of this is more in soft tissue studies,&quot; Rex answered, &quot;because most soft tissue fossils are left only as impressions... getting them is often rare. Either the sediment around the soft tissue doesn&#39;t harden in a way that would show the soft tissue or so on. Which has made the soft tissue fossils all the more important when they are found. But because there have been some of those fossils that have increasingly found Dinosaurs with feathers... there is a great deal of theorizing in the scientific community as to whether or not some Dinosaurs had feathers or not. Enough has been found to suggest that all Dinosaurs at least had the potential to have feathers... but potential and actually having them are different things. Project Mesozoic offers confirmation on what Dinosaurs would actually have feathers and what might only have the potential for them, but didn&#39;t actually manifest. So far... those that have shown feathers have been Coelurosaurian theropods... like myself. Which makes some sense as that grouping of theropods would be the most closely related to birds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... just a post transformation exam, I take it?&quot; Mike Mega asked and Rex nodded as they reached the transformation room.<br />
<br />
Rex moved to stand outside the door while the Horizon scientist lead Michael Mega in. The changing room mirrored the rooms that Horizon had stated were part of its Lyre facility, but they were much bigger. There was actually a small set of steps that lead onto the bed that looked tall enough and long enough to support even the largest Dinotopian. Even Rex would look a bit small on this bed. Michael climbed up the steps and then sat down while the Horizon Scientist set a plastic box on a corner of the bed and began to use it as though it were a table. He produced a syringe that in some ways looked absolutely huge. It was of a wider dimension than a normal syringe with the flaps and plunger also being significantly larger than normal syringes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that a bit big?&quot; Michael Mega asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The needle isn&#39;t,&quot; the Horizon scientist answered, &quot;much of the rest was scaled up... as the head scientist that will run a lot of the supervision for the tests and the other work here with Project Mesozoic is a Dinotopian... but he and his wife aren&#39;t here yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Mega slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may want to strip...&quot; the Horizon scientist spoke, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus was a large theropod... and while you won&#39;t be as big as the fossil animal... what you&#39;re wearing right now won&#39;t survive the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Mega nodded and gave a small sigh. He quietly began stripping off his clothes and setting them in a small pile beside him, figuring they could either go to charity or to someone who became a smaller Dinosaur species. To some extent he was a bit embarrassed as he did so, as this was in front of a male scientist, and while he&#39;d enjoyed body building in his spare time and keeping in shape to try and attract women in his youth, he&#39;d never actually stripped for men. Some of the things he did included some low level body building contests and male stripping to try and win a woman&#39;s attention. To some extent it worked, as his &quot;little Mike&quot; was twelve inches when erect and that earned a fair amount of attention and the stage name &quot;Mr. M.&quot; But as he&#39;d never found one that was &quot;the one&quot; and as he got older, stripping generally turned to a younger star, regardless on how big Michael Mega was. As he finished undressing, he noted that the scientist had bare noticed, if at all and was finishing the prep with the syringe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; the scientist spoke as he came forward around the edge of the bed, &quot;this will count as a double dose, so you will note that its full effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that need two shots though?&quot; Michael Mega asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve done some testing... and while getting it in two servings does confirm the second dose,&quot; the scientist spoke as he leaned over and then swabbed Michael Mega&#39;s shoulder before delivering the injection, &quot;anything over a certain volume when done this way would count as a second dose. Welcome to Dinotopia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Mega watched the man quickly depart and then shut the door as he left, though he could also feel the room growing warmer. He thought it a bit odd as he could swear the air conditioning was on full blast. He couldn&#39;t worry on that too much though as his hair began to fall out and he felt a sort of pulling sensation in his hands and feet. His pinky and ring fingers were slowly pulling together and he looked at them hooked claws began to push out from his fingertips. As Michael Mega looked closer he saw the two fingers on each hand begin to merge, with the skin becoming scaly wrapping around them as they became a new and larger finger. He also noted that while he could see the sort of scale patterns forming and darkening into a very dark brown color on his arms, it&#39;s look and texture sort of reminded him of pictures of the head of a vulture. The bird didn&#39;t have feathers there and that it&#39;s head was essentially scaly skin. That&#39;s sort of the way his hands were forming now. If there were feathers there, they were too fine for him to see.<br />
<br />
And those changes were also occurring further down. As his feet bones began to snap and crackle as they pushed forward to allow him a more digitigrade stance when standing, several of his toes also began to merge with each other  and lengthening until they became splayed three toed feet grayish-brown skin tone and with the pads underneath his feet being tough and thick, like those on various flightless birds. His toenails also lengthened into sharp claws as well, and Michael Mega hopped off of the bed onto the floor as he felt pressure begin to build up on his spine. It made him notice two things, first the bed looked proportionately smaller than it was before, which had to mean he was rapidly getting bigger, and it felt good.<br />
<br />
Looking down he could see his member growing erect and rising into the air as his chest, shoulders, and legs began to bulk up with additional layers of muscle. His skin pulled taught over growing layers of muscle and as his penis grew erect, he noticed a narrow slit opening around it and with his testicles seemingly pulled into it. At first Michael Mega panicked, fearing that somehow he was turning female, but then a more arousing sensation hit him as his member, which was already huge for a human male, got bigger. He&#39;d tentatively lowered his hands down, careful not to cut anything with his claws to make sure that his manhood wasn&#39;t going away, and he felt it slide outward against the scaly skin on his hands. It wasn&#39;t rough and tingled a bit and only furthered to arouse him more. It was at this point that he remembered that given the connections that Dinosaurs had to Reptiles and Birds, it would stand to reason that much of his equipment would be held internally rather then externally. That was something that had really only appeared in Mammals, and particularly with those that didn&#39;t have to worry about being streamlined.<br />
<br />
However, with the growing arousal... Michael Mega soon found himself ignoring just about everything else. Even as his spine began to lengthen into tail with its dorsal side with dark brown specked stripes and the ventral side being a grayish brown. He couldn&#39;t help but grip his enlarging member and begin to pump his hands up and down on the thickening shaft as it rose up. The sensation felt good and he felt his tongue slide in his mouth and he didn&#39;t even notice that his teeth were now narrow, slightly recurved teeth that ended in sharp points. They had literally become the sharp blade like teeth that his species of Dinosaur got its name for, Carcharodontosaurus,  meaning &quot;shark toothed lizard.&quot; He simply pumped his hands up and down on that dark member between his legs that was swelling larger with him. It even began to twitch a little as his hands squeezed and pulled at it as it grew with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh… ohhhh ggoooooood… this feels...&quot; Michael Mega spoke as he soon felt his face began to crackle and snap has his nose flattened and then pushed forward with his mouth, becoming a long and narrow pointed muzzle. His nostrils were merely two openings at the end of his muzzle with the top ridge looking like a sort of long parentheses mark that ran from his eye to the tip of his muzzle. And then as his muzzle completed hits growth, a massive shudder of pleasure hit him and his penis throbbed heavily until it shot up and out as his hands pumped it up and down. The floor was tile and the wall seemed sturdy, which was probably a good thing as the initial shot hit the wall near him as he let out a growling roar, &quot;GGGGGGGOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDUUUUUHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was probably more of a noise that went along with Michael Mega&#39;s increase and size and the fact that most Animalians generally had very human like vocal chords, which would mean they could probably mimic a fair number of different sounds. It might well mean that Project Mesozoic wouldn&#39;t be able to be certain on what Dinosaurs sounded like, but that wasn&#39;t something that Michael Mega was concerned with either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. M is BACK!&quot; Michael Mega smiled as he looked himself over. His tail was reasonably stiff. It was flexible enough to sway and wag slowly, but it wasn&#39;t the serpentine tail that was often depicted in some books. He also noticed that because of the narrowness of his head and the length of his muzzle, his forward facing vision wasn&#39;t as good as it used to be. His eyes could see quite well individually, but it seemed like there were some points in front of him where his depth perception was lacking. Though given what he knew from his research on Carcharodontosaurus with its primary prey being Sauropods and Igaunodonts of Cretaceous Africa, perfect depth perception might not be as necessary, as those sorts of prey wouldn&#39;t move too quickly and would thus be easy targets to grab from the side and then tear off a chunk of flesh.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all built to be big here,&quot; Mr. M said to Jeremy with a smile, &quot;and while we&#39;re never going to be as big as our two sauropod males... between Carcharodontosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and its Syntixisaurus subspecies... we&#39;re nothing to sneer at. You don&#39;t have to get into body building... Rex here isn&#39;t into that either. But I will pump you up... which will then lead to you and your wife having lots of intimate moments together. Trust me that stuff happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy still gulped.</p>
