<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking around at the cards, Ken realized that he had managed to win the last round of the night. “Look at that, a twenty with 4 hits!” Ken cheered while the rest laughed it off. Only Jeff was panicking. <br />
Ken thought it was strange that Jeff wanted to bet themselves like that, given how the world worked, but he figured this would be normal, considering Jeff wouldn’t know what happened, really. He looked down at his body, that had suddenly expanded. His red polo was suddenly tight against large pectoral muscles, not even remotely buttoned as his chest hair poked out. His jeans felt uncomfortably tight, especially along his long thick cock, that no pants would ever conceal now that he had the added thick muscles in his thighs. He reached up and scratched his face, where his new manicured beard rested. He looked over at Jeff, who was now his oldest son, and saw Jeff had taken after his old man, standing at 6’4” and had good sized muscles for a 16-year old. He was also sporting the beginnings of a beard. These gains had definitely reflected in his new son, who now looked more like himself than Mike. He knew Jeff wasn’t his son a moment ago, but he couldn’t help but feel pride at Jeff’s appearance. <br />
Jeff stood up in protest as the change happened, but as his awareness faded, and he shot up in height more than he expected, Jeff instead stumbled to the side. “Woah, easy there!” Ken said to his son in his new deep, booming voice. He walked over and caught Jeff before he fell to the floor. <br />
“I think we should head on home guys, thanks for the great night.” Ken said and Jeff nodded, the alcohol starting to really take its toll. Ken placed an extra $20 in the fishbowl before picking his son up in a fireman’s carry, which was much easier now with the significantly increased muscle mass. Ken looked toward the now scrawny Ty n acknowledgement, who smiled as he said goodbye.<br />
Ken placed Jeff in the backseat of his car before taking to the drivers seat. After he did, he realized how restrained he would feel trying to drive, and took off the plastered on polo shirt. He gave himself a quick flex in the rear view mirror before driving off, smirking about his new accidental gains. <br />
When they arrived home, Ken carried Jeff inside with the same amount of ease as before. In his house, he noticed an additional room had been added before the master bedroom in the hall, and across from the bedrooms where the younger kids slept. He looked inside, and it looked like a teenage boy’s room. He placed Jeff in the bed and chuckled as Jeff rolled over like a child half his age. <br />
Ken then made his way into his bedroom, going to clean himself up in the bathroom before getting in bed with his wife. He spent some time working on beard care, using the new waxes and other chemicals that had suddenly appeared in there. After that, he stripped down to his birthday suit, discarding the worn clothes in the hamper behind him. He decided to flex in the mirror for a bit, quickly putting himself in various bodybuilder poses like he’d done it before which, he remembered, he had. He took part in the amateur bodybuilding now, and definitely had the massively muscular body to prove it. He remembered his next competition was in a couple weeks, which he’d have to shave his new beard for, sadly.<br />
Ken decided to head for sleep, but as he walked toward the drawer that held one of the jockstraps he’d wear while sleeping, he realized that given his new endowment, wearing such a thing would probably be wildly uncomfortable. He was proven right when he opened the drawer and instead of jockstraps for sleeping, it was instead filled with posing shorts for his competitions, with massive packages in the front where his dick stretched the fabric. So instead of putting something on, Ken decided to go to bed in the nude, his massive cock slapping his abs loudly as he laid down for sleep. <br />
The next morning, he was awoken by the pleasure he felt from his cock. He looked down, and his wife Lydia had her hands wrapped around his cock, which stood straight up in a morning wood to a 15 inch height. “Hey.” He said, his voice booming much louder than he intended.<br />
“Shhh, you’ll wake the kids babe.” Lydia responded as she placed his massive fuckstick between her breasts, and her mouth around the tip. She continued stroking his dick, all the while Ken couldn’t help but moan in arousal as she did. After a few minutes of this, Ken began to cum into Lydia’s mouth, and she drank all the weed she could as Ken restrained himself from a complete roar. Lydia laid her head on Kens balloon-like pec and smiled as she placed her hand on his abs, tracing the crevices between the muscles. “Good morning babe.”<br />
After laying together in ecstasy for the better part of a half hour, Ken finally urged Lydia to get up. They both got dressed, Ken choosing to wear a red jockstrap (which were now his normal underwear) and a pair of khaki shorts, forgoing a shirt entirely. Lydia moved to wake up the kids while Ken went to cook breakfast for his family as he usually did. He made protein-packed breakfasts for him and Jeff, and regular sized breakfasts for the rest of his family. Colin, his 7-year old son, was the first to arrive, climbing on his dads muscular back with the boundless energy of a young boy. Ken noted that Colin looked a little different, he seemed to be a bit more toned and have less of the baby fat than most kids had at his age. Chrissy was next, the 2-year old being carried out by Lydia. Just after breakfast was ready did Jeff finally stumble out to the dining room, wearing nothing but a pair of black athletic shorts. Ken realized that Jeff was far bigger than a kid his age should be, already having a visible 6-pack at 16. But nonetheless, he was proud of his new son, who dreamt of becoming a professional bodybuilder once he turned 18.<br />
The family sat together for a quiet breakfast, with only Ken knowing how their family changed overnight.</p>
