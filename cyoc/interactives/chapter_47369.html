<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rico soon had Mark and Tina with their arms across his shoulders as he led them staggering out of the club.  He made like he was getting the valet, but instead Carlos collected the claim slip for Mark's new Ferrari SUV. It would be in pieces before Rico popped Mark's cherry. <br />
<br />
&quot;On second thought,&quot; he said handing Mark back a used baggage claim check instead of the valet slip, &quot;You put that in your pocket, and I'll drive you home. I guess you were right about not being able to mix beer and liquor. Me, I got no problem with it, but you two are snockered.&quot; <br />
<br />
He helped them into the backseat of his car, and drove away.  He grinned as he watched the two lovers in his rear view mirror. The drugs lowered their inhibitions as well as making them woozy. Mark was soon groping Tina, and by the time Rico found a nice secluded spot to park, Mark was already putting on a condom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea,&quot; Rico said as he opened the door behind Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Condom is a good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yeah, always use a condom,&quot; Mark recited the maxim as he focused all his limited attention on putting the rubber glove on his penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;There!&quot; he exclaimed in triumph as he moved on top of half conscious Tina who moaned as he entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, I always use a guy with a condom when I fuck a hot chick,&quot; Rico said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, huh. Huh?&quot; Mark grunted through the haze that had settled on his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's really cool, the guy with the condom becomes a meat puppet. His cock gets hard or harder when I'm inside him. When I thrust, he thrusts. When I pull out, he pulls out. If he was a slow gentle lover, he now mimics my rough, fast, passionate style. Your lady may have bruises before I'm done with you - you most definitely will, Marky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fu- FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!&quot; he screamed as Rico bared his rod in Mark's unlubed ass.<br />
<br />
The drugs were still doing their dirty work, and Mark's protests faded into dull groans and grunts. Tony was horrified as he continued to cradle Rico's balls, while his cock lay across Tony's waistband which was resting against Mark's hairy ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;For a white boy, he's got a hairy ass, Tony. Heh, heh, I'll shave it and tattoo something on it. Something really humiliating and something only  a frat - oooh, that's perfect. Your mind is easier to read than the newspaper. I'll tattoo on Marky's butt that he's been fucked by the bros of Sigma Alpha Gamma as a warning to your frat for dating our women. SAG's the nerd frat, it'll be perfect. I didn't even know that you guys really had nerd frats - haha,&quot; Rico said while using his finger to push through Tony's fabric to stimulate his own anus.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I'm a perv, well, it's like my finger is inside you, my cock is in your frat boy, and my balls are in your mouth. Now if you think I consider us even think again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks to Viagra, Spanish Fly, Rico kept it up for quite a while with his unconscious partners. Then he used a hot needle and ink to make a crude tattoo on Mark's ass. He stretched, his sweat drenched body, and drove to his gymm for a shower. It closed at midnight, but Rico had after hours privileges.  He left Tina in the car, but hoisted Mark over his shoulder and carried him through the back door into the gym.  He was still a little horny, and he prided himself on never having to give himself a hand job since he was 15.  He always kept a hole handy. Tonight Mark was the hole. He wore Tony into the sauna, and lay back and sipped a Corona. Mark lay naked slumped on the bench below him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it your bro said about you changing back if you weren't worn, Tony? Well, I gotta take a dump and shower, so I'll put you on my inflatable sex doll - oh, I mean your frat bro Mark to keep you from changing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then he pulled red briefs on to Mark, and left him lying on the bench with his butt up in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I got one last load in me for tonight,&quot; Rico said as he mounted Mark. When he was done, he swatted Mark's freshly tattooed butt cheek, headed to the showers.<br />
<br />
Tony was screaming for Markt to wake up. Slowly and stiffly, Mark got to his feet and stumbled out of the sauna.  The back door was locked, but Mark finally got the bolt pulled and stumbled out to Rico's unlocked car. Tina lay snorning in the backseat. Tony made Mark look inside the visor for Rico's spare key. That mind reading gig worked both ways.<br />
<br />
Mark managed to park the car in open garage behind his parents' house, and fell asleep behind the wheel. Tony's incessant urgings for Mark to take off Rico's briefs had no effect on Mark.  Unless they were the reason he popped a major boner and had a wet dream involving Rico and Tony.<br />
<br />
When Mark finally came to around 7 am. he staggered out of the car and vomited. He looked at the briefs he was wearing and grimaced. He pulled the soiled briefs down far enough so he could piss. Without even shaking he shoved his wet dripping cock back inside Rico's briefs.<br />
<br />
Tony's mind cajoled him for not even shaking. Then he reiterated his demands to be taken off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it wasn't a dream. The way my ass feels, I didn't think it was one. Well, Tony, bro, I'm sorry, really I am, but I can't let anyone know that I was fucked by Rico, and that I dreamed about having a three way with you and him. So I'm not taking you off. Can't risk it. I'm going inside to shower, and I'll wear you in the shower and blow dry you. Then, I bet you can't change back if you're pressed flat, but there may be another way.  I need to get cleaned up and ready before Tina wakes up. She can be a mean drunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why does everyone want to wear me 24/7? thought an exasperated Tony, whose own mind had long since turned from what tortures he'd inflict on Roger when he got his body back to figuring out a way to escape from a captor that can read his every thought.</p>
