<br />
Jeff And Mason Were Still Best Of Friends And Even Still Used The Chronivac For Random Hijinks But Never Messing With Their Minds Or Gender... And Despite Both Having Longing Feelings For The Time Jeff Was Jess... Neither Ever Brought It Up... So They Continued To Be Friends Each Of Them Even Started Dating But Neither Had Any Real Luck With It... And Their School&#39;s Prom Was Coming Up Soon, And Both Were Single With No Time Left To Find A Date... <br />
<br />
When Mason Called Jeff And Asked Him If Jess Wanted To Go To The Prom With Him? Mason Made It Clear That It Clear That Jeff Could Say No And It Was Only A Suggestion But Jeff Immediately Said Yes. Which Shocked Mason... But He Didn&#39;t Question It Instead He Simply Got A Tux Ready And When Prom Came He Knocked On Jeff&#39;s Door To See If He Was Ready.<br />
When  The Door Opened It Wasn&#39;t Jeff Who Opened The Door It Was Jess And She Looked Beautiful In A Tight Blue Dress That Hugged All His Curves Just Right Her Hair Was Done Up And She Clearly In Makeup... Which Made Mason Blush When He Saw It...Last Time He Saw Jess She Was A 16 Year Teen Girl... Still Sexy But Not Compared To Jess As A Young Woman... Mason Got Hard Just Seeing Her...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Are You Ready To Go?&quot; Mason Asks, Holding Out His Arm, Jess Grabs It And They Walk To The Car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do You Wanna Ride In Front Or In Back?&quot; Mason Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;In  The Front With You&quot; Jess Says Blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Is It, Cutie?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Um, I&#39;ve Missed You... Like A Lot...&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same Here,&quot; Mason Says Smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can We... Um, Kiss, Like Just Once...?&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
<br />
Mason&#39;s Eyes Go Wide, &quot;Are You Sure That&#39;s What You Want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Please,&quot; Jess Says, Pleading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Mason Says, Leaning In And Kissing Jess On The Lips, After He Broke The Kiss, Jess Was Smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank You, Now Let&#39;s Get Going, We Don&#39;t Wanna Be Late,&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
When They Arrive, They Immediately Are Surrounded By Shocked Expressions Wondering How Mason Could Bag Such A Hottie Who They&#39;ve Never Seen At This School...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, This Is The Most Popular Guy In School, His Name Is Adam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Nice To Meet You,&quot; Jess Says, Taking His Hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Pleasure Is All Mine,&quot; Adam Says, Giving Jess A Flirty Smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam, We&#39;re Together, Stop,&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Really, How Cute, I&#39;ll Let You Know Where We Are When Your Date Is Done,&quot; Adam Says, Walking Away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Jealous.&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Jealous, I Could Tell By The Way You Spoke To Him,&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I Wasn&#39;t,&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Cute...But You Don&#39;t Need To Worry I&#39;m All Yours&quot; Jess Says As She Kisses Mason&#39;s Cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s Just Dance&quot; Mason Says Blushing.<br />
<br />
For The First 10 Minutes, Mason Danced With Jess, Jess Was Surprised At How Well Mason Lead She Had No Clue How To Dance In The Woman&#39;s Part But Under Mason&#39;s Lead She Hardly Made Any Mistakes, She Could Simply Just Look Into Mason&#39;s Gorgeous Eyes As He Held Her Tight And Simply Let The Music Control Her Body.<br />
<br />
After Those 10 Minutes Jess Was Pulled Away By Some Girls Who Were Very Curious As To Who This Girl Was That Mason Brought, They Took Her Outside To Ask Her Questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Who Are You?&quot; One Girl Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason&#39;s Date,&quot; Jess Says, Not Sure What They Mean.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, How&#39;d You Meet Him?&quot; Another Girl Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, We Had A Blind Date Like A Year Back That Went Well But Nothing Ever Happened With Us... And With His Prom Coming Up And Me Being Single He Called And Asked If We Can Pick Up Where We Left Off...Now If You&#39;ll Excuse Me I Don&#39;t Wanna Keep Him Waiting&quot; Jess <br />
Smiles.<br />
<br />
The Girls Look At Each Other Before Letting Jess Go, &quot;You Lucky Girl, Don&#39;t Mess This Up, I&#39;d Do Anything To Be In Your Place, He&#39;s Perfect, And He&#39;s The Hottest Guy In Our School!&quot; One Of The Girls Yells.<br />
<br />
Jess Hearing This Was Shocked... Mason Was Popular With The Girls Then Why Did He Need Me As A Date...She Makes Her Way Back Into The Dance, Looking For Mason.<br />
<br />
When She Finds Him, She Sees He&#39;s Getting Chatted Up By Some Girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Baby, There You Are.&quot; Jess Says, Walking Up To Him In A Rush And Gives Him A Hug, Then Kissing His Lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I Got Diverted&quot; Jess Says, Whispering In His Ear Then Looking Menacingly At The Girls...<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Okay,&quot; Mason Says, Smiling, &quot;Ladies, This Is Jess, My Date,&quot; He Says.<br />
<br />
The Girls Give Jess A Fake Smile And Say, &quot;Nice To Meet You&quot; Before The Girls Begin Walking Away Kind Of Scared Of Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Mason Says Whispering In Jess&#39;s Ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;For What?&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
&quot;Getting Rid Of Them... I Never Know How To Get Them Off My Back, They Won&#39;t Stop Coming Until You Interrupted, You&#39;re A Life Saver.&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Your Really Popular With The Ladies Huh... Then Why Did You Need Me As A Date, I&#39;m Sure You Could Have Gotten A Better Girl, I Mean According To Basically Every Girl Here You Are The Hot Guy Of The School Who Everyone Girl Wanted To Date... I Thought You Didn&#39;t Have Anyone.&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
Mason Shrugs His Shoulders, &quot;Because Jess... I&#39;ve Tried Dating Other Girls And Whether I Want To Or Not I Compare Them To You... And None Of Them Even Come Close... So I&#39;m Sorry For Tricking Jeff But...I Really Missed You Jess, You&#39;re The Best Girl I&#39;ve Ever Had...And I&#39;ve Always Wanted To Have A Second Date With You But Couldn&#39;t Figure Out A Good Way...I Mean I Guess I Could Have Just Asked But...&quot; Mason Stops, Realizing He Was Rambling.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m Really Better Than All These Girls, I&#39;m Not That Hot, And I&#39;m Definitely Not Better Than Any Of These Girls, I Think You Must Just Be Biased&quot; Jess Says Blushing<br />
<br />
Mason Grabs Her Hand, &quot;Jess, Come On, You&#39;re Better Than Every Girl Here, You&#39;re So Cute, Sweet, Funny, Nice, Sexy, And You&#39;re Also One Of The Most Beautiful Women Here, We Have Fun Together, I&#39;m So Happy When I&#39;m With You... And Even If It&#39;s Just For Tonight I Needed To See You Again&quot; Mason Says, Pulling Her Closer And Kissing Her Cheek.<br />
<br />
Jess Blushes, &quot;Really, You Mean That?&quot; She Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Mason Says, Wrapping His Arms Around Her And Staring Into Her Eyes, &quot;Your Eyes Are So Pretty, Jess, Like The Perfect Colored Green,&quot; Mason Says, Before Leaning In And Kissing Her Lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s Go Somewhere,&quot; Jess Says, Whispering In His Ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I Have Just The Spot,&quot; Mason Says, Gripping Her Hand And Leading Her Out Of The Building And Into The Woods.<br />
<br />
When They Arrived, They Were At A Private Place In The Woods Where There Was A Lake, With A Dock And A Swing, There Was Also A <br />
Hammock And A Picnic Table, Mason Sat Down On The Swing And Jess Sat In His Lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Do You Bring Girls Here?&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... It&#39;s A Special Place...My Parents Built It For Me When I Was Young...I Come Here When I Want To Think Or Be Alone I&#39;ve Never <br />
Been Here With Anyone...&quot; Mason Says, Staring At Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even Jeff&#39;s Never Been Here Before&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because No One But Me And My Parents Knew About This Place... Until Now,&quot; Mason Says, Brushing Her Hair Away From Her Face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Really Beautiful Here&quot; Jess Says, Looking At The Lake, Which Was Sparkling Under The Full Moon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah It Is...&quot; Mason Says, Not Even Looking At The Lake, Just Jess.<br />
<br />
Jess Noticing His Eyes Are Still On Her Says, &quot;You&#39;re Not Looking At The Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Your So Much More Beautiful,&quot; Mason Says, Brushing His Hand Through Her Hair, And Over Her Face. Before Leaning In And Kissing Her Lips Jess Kisses Back And It Soon Turns Into A Make-Out Session. They Continued Until Mason Was On Top Of Her And They Were Making Out, With His Hands Wandering Around Her Body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve Missed You So Much...&quot; Mason Whispers, Between Kisses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve Missed You Too, Mason, I Wish I Would Have Stayed As Jess...&quot; Jess Whispers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... We Don&#39;t Need To Go Back...You Can Stay Here, If You Want,&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;As Jess Or Jeff&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;As Jess With Me!&quot; Mason Says, Stroking Her Hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff Isn&#39;t Ready Mason...&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;How Do You Know That?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Can Feel It, But That Doesn&#39;t Mean We Can&#39;t Enjoy The Here And Now While We Have It&quot; Jess Says Grabbing His Body And Pulling Him Closer To Her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then Let&#39;s Enjoy It&quot; Mason Says And He Begins To Caress Every Part Of Jess&#39;s Body, He Was Careful To Avoid Her Breasts And Privates But Otherwise He Touched Every Bit Of Her... Jess Moans Under His Touch, Which Makes Him Smile.They Continue Kissing For A Little While, When Jess Starts Unbuttoning His Jacket, Which Mason Helps Her Remove, Once That Is Done, Jess Gets Off Of Him And Starts Taking Her Dress Off, Mason&#39;s Eyes Go Wide And He Starts Stuttering.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-what Are You Doing&quot; He Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taking My Dress Off,&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-why?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, Mason... If I&#39;m Going To Leave Again I Want To Give You Something To Remember Me By.&quot; Jess Says, As She Takes Off Her Dress <br />
Revealing A Black Lace Bra, And Panties, Mason&#39;s Dick Becomes Instantly Hard, Jess Sees It And Starts To Take Her Bra Off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, What About Jeff Is He Gonna Be Okay With This?&quot; Mason Asks, As He Watches Her Take Her Bra Off, Her Beautiful Boobs Pop Out, Making Mason Even Harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t Worry, I&#39;ve Blocked Jeff From Seeing What Comes Next!&quot; Jess Says, Smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, You Can Do That?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of Course, You&#39;ve Forgotten Who You&#39;re Talking To... Now Strip&quot; Jess Orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, I&#39;m Not Sure If I&#39;m Ready, I Mean...&quot; Mason Says, Before Being Cut Off By Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason, I Want You To Have Something To Remember Me By, I Want To Give Myself To You... And I Promise I&#39;ll Never Forget This Either.&quot; <br />
Jess Says, Leaning In And Kissing His Neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, I Can&#39;t Resist You&quot; Mason Says, Before Undressing Himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, Nice Dick&quot; Jess Says, Eyeing It Hungrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Mason Asks, Surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Definitely, Can I Ride It&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only If You Want Too, Baby,&quot; Mason Says, Staring Deeply Into Her Eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Do,&quot; Jess Says, Climbing On Top Of Him. Mason&#39;s Cock Started Pushing Its Way Inside Her Ass, Jess Was Able To Take The Whole Thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh My God, That&#39;s Big&quot; Jess Says, Feeling Full.<br />
<br />
&quot;You Feel Amazing, Baby,&quot; Mason Says, Holding Her Body, As She Begins Moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Do You, Oh God, Yes, It Feels So Good&quot; Jess Moans, As She Rides Mason&#39;s Dick, Mason Wraps His Arms Around Her And Starts Kissing <br />
Her Neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;This Is Amazing, Oh Fuck, You&#39;re So Big!&quot; Jess Moans, Moving Her Hips Faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, I&#39;ve Dreamt About This Moment For So Long&quot; Mason Whispers, In Her Ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Have I, I&#39;m Glad You Finally Managed To Bring Me Back Here, Oh Yes!&quot; Jess Moans.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Am I, Oh Yes, Baby, Oh Yes, That Feels So Good, Mmm, Faster, Faster, Oh Yes&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
Jess Begins Going Faster And Harder, Until They Both Cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Love You, Mason&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Love You Too, Baby&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
They Lie In The Swing, Just Enjoying Each Other&#39;s Company.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Wish This Could Last Forever,&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Do I, Mason,&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do You Have To Go, Can&#39;t You Stay Just A Little Longer,&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sorry, Mason, But I&#39;m Ready To Change Back Now&quot; Jess Says, As She Gets Off Of Mason, And Puts Her Dress Back On. &quot;I&#39;ll Miss You Mason!&quot; Jess Says Before Heading Home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll Miss You Too&quot; Mason Whispers, As He Watches Her Leave.<br />
<br />
The Next Morning Mason Calls Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; Jeff Answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jeff, Are You Still Mad At Me&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m Not Mad, Why Did You Call&quot; Jeff Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I Wanted To Apologize For Everything That Happened, And Tell You That You&#39;re Not Mad At Me Anymore, But Also Ask If We Can <br />
Hang Out Sometime&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re Fine, Thanks For The Apology And Sure, Why Not, Come On Over&quot; Jeff Says.<br />
<br />
