<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to do it&quot; Dan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kat screams.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you shut up,&quot; Mom says, pointing her wand at her daughter. &quot;I let Dan decide the punishment, and I stand by that, even if I find it personally creepy. But,&quot; Mom continues, turning to her son, &quot;I too would like to know why you&#39;d like to father your sister&#39;s baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kat thought I hate her, but she is not the only one of us that needs to grow up.&quot; Dan crosses the room and looks his sister deeply in the eyes. &quot;I want... I want to be a father. And I despite everything, I can imagine nobody I&#39;d rather have raise my child than Kat.&quot; Dan puts his arms around his sister and gives her the most passionate, loving kiss she ever has gotten.<br />
<br />
In the sudden rush of emotion, Kat feels no choice but return the kiss with the same passion. From the corner of her eyes as she returned her brother&#39;s kiss, Kat can see that Mom has already used her wand, this feeling is manufactured in her. But somehow, she thinks, she doesn&#39;t care. Dan does love me and I do love him. They break the kiss, and hold hands as they walk past their mother. <br />
<br />
They walk through a shimmer.<br />
<br />
Kat looks at her brother, tears running down her face, why had that dumb boyfriend of hers bragged about banging that hot cheerleader the day before her birthday? Dan had walked in on her crying her eyes out wearing just a towel. She heard the text ding from the shower and had been so upset she forgot to get dressed. She felt her clothes melt off her. A pink towel lay at the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
She leads Dan in to her room. Dan has no time to look around before his sister pulls him on to her bed. Dan no longer remembered why he was nude. &quot;Dan, touch me, explore my body&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
Dan kisses Kat&#39;s face from forehead to chin, giving her the giggles. They ran their hands all over each other. He caresses his sister&#39;s cheek, then runs his hand down her neck, over her shoulder, and cups her breast. She reaches both hands around her brother, gripping his ass and pulling him up against her naked body. Dan put his hand in her slit. &quot;Are you wet for me Kat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pleasure and lust have pushed all thoughts out of her head except wanting dick in her pussy. She guides him in to her.<br />
<br />
Dan no longer cares that this is his sister, his only thought was to worship her with his body. He tests Kat with his hands, his mouth, his dick. As the younger brother, he is the same height as his sister, and their bodies fit together like puzzle pieces. Deep inside her body, he begins to stroke in and out. Kat is not a virgin, but her brother is, and she silently teaches him what a woman wants a man to offer her body.<br />
<br />
Kat has a number of orgasms before her brother comes in to her unprotected womb.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Dad looks up from his book, at the sound of his daughter and son having sex. &quot;Are we sure about this, honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Mom says. &quot;I&#39;ve enchanted them so that every child they conceive will be perfectly healthy. I&#39;ll make sure they get married so their baby is legitimate. And frankly, after what I saw tonight, it&#39;s clear that Kat needs something to care about more than she cares about herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad shakes his head. &quot;I trust you, honey. But... that&#39;s my baby girl up there, getting nailed by my little man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me, this isn&#39;t what I would have picked either, love. But in the long run, it will be better for both of them. And I&#39;m ready to be a grandmother.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
The brother and sister cuddle after sex, with no thought of his sperm swimming in her body. Kat spoons against her brother, his soft, spent dick pressed into her ass, their mingled sweat soaking into the bedsheets.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was better than I could have ever anticipated,&quot; Dan says, wrapping an arm around his sister to cup her breast.<br />
<br />
Kat rubs her hand gently over her brother&#39;s hand and up his arm. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Dan. It only gets better from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
They go to Kat&#39;s birthday dinner with their parents and her friends. She winks at him as she unwraps her presents. Only the incestuous siblings and their parents know that Kat and Dan are now lovers. Kat loves having a secret from her friends... and loves the taboo feeling of having her brother&#39;s sperm moving around the inside of her womb. She looks at her handsome brother, smiles, and feels her nipples stand up under her blouse.<br />
<br />
At home, Mom and Dad go to bed. As Kat and Dan watch movies, she puts her head on his shoulder and says &quot;I do not want to sleep alone tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan hugs his sister-lover to him, sliding his hand up and down her arm. &quot;You never have to sleep alone again, sweetheart, not unless you want to. You only have to ask, and I&#39;m there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m asking,&quot; Kat says. &quot;Keep me warm, brother... inside and out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan grins, feeling the rush of lust for his beautiful, literally magical sister.<br />
<br />
The incestuous siblings brush their teeth. Kat throws her clothes in to her room and lets Dan lead her in to his room nude. The brother and sister make love a number of times before they fall asleep in each others arms.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, Kat is staring at the pregnancy test with two pink lines. &quot;Dan,&quot; she yells.<br />
<br />
Dan runs in and puts his arms around his before looking at the test. &quot;You&#39;re...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Kat says, crying, &quot;our baby inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have...&quot; Dan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too tell mom and dad,&quot; Kat finishes.<br />
<br />
Holding the test in one hand and her brother&#39;s hand in the other, Kat leads them downstairs.<br />
<br />
Mom and Dad are sitting in the living room. &quot;Mom, Dad... I am pregnant with Dan&#39;s baby,&quot; Kat says.<br />
<br />
Mom chuckles at that. &quot;To think, just two weeks ago you tried to kill your brother by swallowing him into your stomach. Now you two have created new life deep in your belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be honest,&quot; Dad says, &quot;I&#39;d always looked forward to the day my baby girl brought my future son-in-law home and I would get to meet him. I never expected to say I met my daughter&#39;s future husband in the maternity ward. But I must say, I&#39;ve never seen you two happier, or more at peace with one another, than in the two weeks since you became lovers. This isn&#39;t the future I expected for my children, but if it&#39;s the life you two want, God bless you.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Do you kids want a wedding?&quot; Mom asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t talked about it,&quot; Kat says, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to be showing in my wedding photos. No way do I want to look like some redneck teen bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then ether you get married in the next four months or after the baby is born,&quot; Mom says.<br />
<br />
&quot;We would have to talk&quot; Dan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, god,&quot; Kat exclaims, a sudden look of horror crossing her face. &quot;We&#39;ve gone from brother and sister doing something bad to Mom planing our wedding.&quot; She runs upstairs and climbs onto her bed, face streaked with tears. Dan runs after her.<br />
<br />
Mom and Dad watch their children flee. After a moment of silence, Mom picks up her cup of coffee and takes a slow sip. &quot;I&#39;ll have to tell them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I enchanted them so they could have incestuous sex without conceiving a malformed baby. But a &#39;healthy&#39; baby doesn&#39;t mean a &#39;normal&#39; baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad squints at his wife, trying to squelch the rising sense of horror in his belly. &quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they&#39;ll have a human baby. But there&#39;s a better-than-even chance that our daughter will give birth to some kind of supernatural being. I couldn&#39;t even tell you what at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, without a word, Mom rises and retires to the kitchen, leaving Dad to stare after her, too shocked to even speak.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Dan comes into Kat&#39;s room and puts his arms around her. The image of her womb expanding, breasts growing to hold the milk she will need to feed their baby, herself in a wedding dress being led down the aisle by her father to wed Dan runs through her mind.<br />
<br />
After a long moment of silence, Dan starts kissing down his sister&#39;s neck. The touch of his lips on her skin is the medicine she needs. Kat leans back into her brother&#39;s embrace and, after a moment, smiles.<br />
<br />
In less than five minutes, brother and sister are re-enacting the moment they conceived a baby together.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
The weeks pass, and Kat&#39;s breasts expand. She and Dan talk about marrying. Mom teaches her a tea that helps with morning sickness. Mom and Kat go wedding dress shopping and, after a few false starts, they find the right one, a light mermaid dress that highlights her well-formed and growing breasts, while drawing attention away from her no-longer-slim waist.<br />
<br />
Up in her room, Dan and Kat are cuddling after sex. She has been pregnant a month. &quot;Dan?&quot; she asks. &quot;Do you really want to marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Kat, and you are having our baby. I want to marry you more than anything. I just wish you would make up your mind, we have been ring shopping for two weeks.&quot; Dan chuckles, and strokes his hands down his sister&#39;s succulent body. &quot;You would think an eighteen-year-old female would know what she likes in jewelry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do know, its just my emotions have been all over the place, with the baby and that it would legal for us to get married and Mom taking me shopping for wedding dresses, its been a crazy month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think it has been easy for me?&quot; Dan sucks on his big sister&#39;s earlobe while his fingers draw lazy circles on her hip. &quot;I have sex with the girl that helped raise me and knock her up, Mom and Dad react by planing our wedding, and I am a sixteen year old kid, probably not any ones choice of husband or dad. Believe me, I&#39;ve been having some crisis moments myself these last six weeks. But yes I do want you to be my knocked up teen witch bride.&quot; He laughs at the sound of his own comment. &quot;God, sounds like a bad sitcom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat rolls over to look at her brother-lover. &quot;Even with the law and the stigma of incest? Even though you&#39;re not an adult yet? Even though we&#39;ll both probably have to drop out of school, and spend our lives raising a child we didn&#39;t exactly plan? You still want to marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan grabs Kat&#39;s wide-eyed, alabaster face between his hands and kisses her gently. &quot;Kat,&quot; he says. &quot;Lover. Sister. Mother of our child. I want to be your husband, and raise our baby, more than I&#39;ve ever wanted anything. I love you, and I love what we&#39;ve done. And I want to wear a tux, and see you in that dress, and I want the whole world to see that a brother and sister in love can be the happiest husband and wife of all time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to make sure you understand this,&quot; Kat says. &quot;Just like Mom warned us, while I&#39;m pregnant, I have no witch powers. I can&#39;t make you do anything. If you marry me, I can&#39;t give you anything. And if you run away, I can&#39;t punish you. So tell me the truth, is this what you really want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan smiles, then strokes one hand on his sister&#39;s cheek, the other on her breast. &quot;If you doubt me, Katherine Morgan le Fay, let me ask you again: will you marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kat says. &quot;Yes, so much. I will marry you, Dan. Thank you. I love you.&quot; She kisses her brother, and pulls him close, and soon they&#39;re making love again—as they do two, three, four times a day anymore. More on weekends. Brother and sister are addicted to each other&#39;s bodies.<br />
<br />
After they&#39;re done, after Dan&#39;s sperm is once again swimming toward his sister&#39;s already-pregnant womb, without him even pulling out of her, Kat kisses her brother full on the lips. &quot;Then we have some decisions to make, baby brother.&quot;</p>
