<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty watched in delight as he observed each of his classmates uncontrollably squirming in their seats. He particularly enjoyed the subtle way his classmates' faces slowly changed, losing baby fat and gaining definition and masculinity. He noticed that some of the chubby kids' shirts had loosened a bit while the thin teenagers' clothes had gotten a wee bit tighter. He looked down around the floor beside him and he was sure that his classmates' feet had gotten bigger too.<br />
<br />
God, I wonder what's going through their heads, wondered Ty.<br />
<br />
Mr. Bretmon continued his lecture totally unaware of what was happening right under his nose. &quot;... And so through the onset of puberty...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty's friend Jason let out a gasp as did a few others. &quot;Unnngh...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything the matter?&quot; asked Mr. Bretmon, stopping his lecture when he heard the collective stifled outburst of his class. His eyes darted from student to student and he wondered why some of them looked very uncomfortable. He also noticed that a few of them were wearing such tight shirts. There was also this slight musky scent permeating the room, a masculine scent becoming stronger by the minute. And strangely, his students seemed to be getting older right before his very eyes. Naaah, that's impossible, thought Mr. Bretmon, I need to have my eyes checked.<br />
<br />
Ty was having a field day. He gleefully scanned the room and surreptitiously viewed the next stage of his classmates' transformation. One or two were really sweating although some were just fidgeting in their seats. There was at least one guy had his hand on his crotch rubbing through the material of jeans. Jason himself wasn't faring too well. His pants were eating into his body and his shoes were unbelievably tight but he still didn't know why. By this time, he and his classmates had aged approximately 3 years for the 3 times Mr. Brenton had mentioned the word &quot;puberty&quot; and most of them have really matured. Testosterone and other hormones were going through their systems like crazy, their muscles had gotten bigger and stronger, their baby fat (for those who still had 'em) had all but disappeared (though no one seemed to have notice it yet), their pubic hair had really sprouted (and starting to itch slightly), and their cock and balls had definitely entered the stage of puberty. There wasn't a boy without an erection in that room with Ty sporting the biggest one of all.<br />
<br />
One of the students raised his hand, &quot;Uh, Mr. Bretmon, I need to go to the bathroom. I need a pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then suddenly the entire room erupted, &quot;Me too Mr. Bretmon! Me too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet down people!&quot; shouted Mr. Bretmon. &quot;No one goes out of here without my say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I have to go real bad,&quot; begged the student.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're just going to have to hold it in. You're not a kid anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
How right you are, giggled Ty. He turned to Jason who was obviously in pain. Ty asked innocently, &quot;What's with you, Jase? You don't look too hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck man... I don't know. I can't describe it...&quot; replied Jason breathing heavily. &quot;It's like my body's so fucking tight everywhere. My shirt, my pants and my shoes are killing me and I don't know why. I-I think I need to see the nurse...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty took a good look at his friend and liked what he saw. The few years that had been added really looked good on him. Jason's face was much more handsome and striking; Ty could make out the sexy cheekbones and strong chin now. Moving down, Ty approved of the way Jason's pecs and arms had grown to fit in his shirt and how his legs filled out his jeans to the point he could make out their muscular contours. But best of all was Jason's bulging package--it was bigger and harder than it had ever been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah...&quot; said Ty, &quot;you'll be fine. Heck, you'll be better than ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason blurted out, &quot;What are you talk...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. O'Connell, is there anything you'd like to share with the class?&quot; Mr. Bretmon suddenly interrupted. The entire class turned their attention to Jason who froze in fear. For the first time, some of them saw that there was something different about their classmate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuh, no, Mr. Bretmon,&quot; he squeaked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? You seem to be having an interesting discussion with your seatmate over there. Why don't you stand up and tell us all about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nervously rose from his seat and was having a difficult time moving in his constricting clothes. His toes were even curled up in his shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. O'Connell, are you trying to make fun of us? Why are you wearing such small clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason didn't know what the heck Mr. Bretmon was talking about until he saw for himself how he looked. His shirt was terribly stretched and his pants were too small for him. Jason had gotten a lot taller since the start of the class and unbeknownst to his classmates, so did they, but they were all laughing and snickering at Jason, all except Ty who didn't care much for Mr. Bretmon's embarrassing his friend.<br />
<br />
Ty raised his hand, &quot;Ah, I put him up to it Mr. Bretmon. I made him a bet that he wouldn't wear his brother's clothes to school today and looks like he beat me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Bretmon first glared at Ty then at Jason. &quot;Is that true, Mr. O'Connell?&quot; Jason just nodded his head yes not knowing what else to do. &quot;Fine, take your seat and just listen to the rest of the lecture. That goes for all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason gladly sat down and gave Ty a quick and silent &quot;thanks&quot; which Ty acknowledged. Ty decided that 40-year-old Mr. Bretmon needs to re-learn how to have a little more fun in his life.<br />
<br />
