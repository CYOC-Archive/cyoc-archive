<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Several days of lucky breaks, bad toilet situations, and general wishes for civilization or the sweet embrace of death Rick got himself a new class [Survivalist]... level 4... it came with [Robust Stomach] and [Edibility Intuition]... wasn&#39;t pleasant but he wasn&#39;t going to starve. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile he found himself at a small campsite that wasn&#39;t much more than a few tents, a fire, and some cooking equipment over the fire. It was still enough for Rick to find it and it&#39;s 3 inhabitants. Someone resting in full armor that seemed to be glowing with a faint greenish energy, an elf in some robes resting with a staff that Rick couldn&#39;t tell if they were male or female, and a more lithe man chopping stuff to put into a boiling pot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Rick asked as he approached the campsite &quot;I&#39;m a little lost.&quot;<br />
The lithe man said &quot;A little? We&#39;re days off any civilization...&quot; then he took a look at Rick and said &quot;You&#39;re one of those outworlders aren&#39;t you? Ya&#39;ll seem to pop up more often these days and you seem to have some manners. Got any classes yet?&quot; <br />
Rick nodded &quot;Two [Survivalist] is one&quot;<br />
The lithe man nodded &quot;Aye, you have the look of a guy who&#39;d have maybe 3-4 levels?&quot; Rick nodded as the lithe man asked &quot;And the other?&quot;<br />
Rick said &quot;I&#39;m a [Priest o-&quot; and Rick was cutoff by the elf. <br />
&quot;Priest?!&quot; the elf picked up their staff as their concerned voice betrayed no hint of sex<br />
The lithe man said &quot;Stop Zelki, we don&#39;t need to go picking fights. Not all those gods were bad. The god of peace is just chilling in his domain right now.&quot;<br />
The elf Zelki rolled their eyes and said &quot;Sure they are... up until they decide things aren&#39;t peaceful ENOUGH and wage war to enforce TOTAL PEACE!&quot;<br />
The thing in the armor said clearly in a muffled voice &quot;I&#39;ll check...&quot; and faster than Rick could see he was grabbed and dragged off. The campsite wasn&#39;t that far away, but there should be some privacy. &quot;[Priest of] what?&quot;<br />
Rick muttered a little shaken &quot;[Priest of Lust]&quot;<br />
&quot;Levels, skills OUT WITH IT!&quot;<br />
&quot;9 levels, [minor stamina], [basic prayer], [horny prayer], [Eroia&#39;s seductiveness]...&quot; Rick could feel something about this person staring deep into him... Then the iron grip was gone.<br />
&quot;[Equipment swap]&quot; and then the thing in the armor was just in plain clothes. Human like the lithe man, and judging based on her facial structure probably female... no not probably for sure female, but it was hard to tell. Her hair was short, but the rest of her was horribly marred in scars, some chunks missing. Her left breast was missing, and most of her right one was gone as well... probably a few many attacks to the chest that didn&#39;t pan out right. &quot;Try it, a prayer or seductiveness.&quot; There was a bit of desperation in her voice. <br />
Rick breathed in heavily as he started with a basic prayer for his safety in this, a horny prayer for whatever this brute force girl wanted, and... &quot;I think I can do a little bit more~&quot; Eroia&#39;s will echo&#39;d into Rick &quot;She seems strong, it&#39;ll be good for us to have her as a follower&quot;. <br />
&quot;[Eroia&#39;s seductiveness]&quot; Rick stated as he put one hand on the warrior&#39;s cheek and the warrior could feel her body getting a bit more attractive. Most of the scars were there, her breasts weren&#39;t entirely back but they were a bit more even... but more amazingly for Rick<br />
<br />
Level up [Priest of Lust]: level 14<br />
Blessing obtained: [Cure Wounds]<br />
Skill obtained: [Restoration of Beauty]<br />
<br />
&quot;[Cure Wounds]&quot; Rick then said as he felt blessings flow to the warrior who was surprised as well. She currently wasn&#39;t injured in any way a healing potion could fix, but a skill mixed with a Blessing could do what pure magic couldn&#39;t. The warrior could feel her flesh come back, her breasts existing, the chunks missing filling out. Scars were fading and... Rick felt empty... It&#39;s not like Blessings were free to a Priest. They didn&#39;t run on something like mana, but they ran on something else and currently Rick was empty. The world looked a little faded, his motivation was low... It was coming back though... bit by bit although it may take some time. <br />
<br />
The Lithe man heard footsteps and said &quot;Oh, he&#39;s not... dead...&quot; he saw his friend and teammate Rina bring back Rick with her armor off... and she was intact...<br />
&quot;We&#39;re keeping him!&quot; Rina stated<br />
&quot;You traitor! You sold out!&quot; Zelki grabbed her staff, but a quick [Equipment Swap] and Rina was ready for a fight... and both knew that before Zelki could aim and prepare a spell Rina could slit her throat. <br />
The Lithe man sighed and said &quot;Stop... Ok the party&#39;s split. This isn&#39;t going to work. Can we agree to-&quot;<br />
Zelki seeing a moment where Rina was distracted aimed a bit and then started a quie- Rina dashed in less than a blink and [equipment swapped] her blade into her hand at the moment where it would contact Zelki&#39;s throat. The fight lasted half a second, but that&#39;s what a standoff at their level meant most of the time... Either that or a fight lasting hours with everything being blown up if it were a slightly more balanced warrior v warrior type or mage v mage type battle. <br />
Rick started praying as the Lithe man cursed &quot;Did you have t- DAMNED GODS! Ok, I guess we have to retreat back to town and...&quot;<br />
Rina said &quot;I&#39;ll pay for the wasted time...&quot; The Lithe man looked at Rick and just felt frustration... He kept telling himself that Rick hadn&#39;t done anything wrong other than exist as a [Priest] most of those Outworlders didn&#39;t have gods or classes or all this complicated things. It was still irritating. <br />
&quot;Stop praying for that Elf Rick&quot; Eroia responded &quot;I&#39;m not that type of goddess, nor do I care for those that shun me. You should be safe. Your little knight in glowing armor will make sure of that.&quot; Rick was still mostly empty, but he could feel a little... Shock was diluted to concern, fear got diluted into that concern as well, and... it was just all exhausting Rick as he found a nice log to lay against and just start sleeping.</p>
