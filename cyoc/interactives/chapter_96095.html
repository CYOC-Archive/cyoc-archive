<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason scoured over the names of all the weird concoctions multiple times. Some were easy to decipher the effects they provided while others were much more unclear. Several minutes passed before he finally asked the bartender &quot;What would you recommend?&quot;<br />
<br />
She snorted loudly. &quot;Me?! No no no, this is completely your decision. I don&#39;t even know your name newbie, I can&#39;t decide what would be the best drink for you to order. It&#39;s a personal choice. I wouldn&#39;t want to give you some Youthenizer if you would prefer to get older. Or a pint of Fuzzy Muster if you like being a hairless fella. Although maybe the other customers could give you some inspiration&quot;  Someone who had to be even younger than Jason was entered the bar. He barely looked old enough to be out of high school, let alone drinking age. His oversized vest and extra baggy pants didn&#39;t help matters. Tina gave him a friendly nod as he sat down on the other side of the bar.  &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have a customer who actually can make up his mind&quot;. She headed towards the young guy, leaving Jason to his own thoughts. Maybe it was a good idea to see what other people had ordered before making a decision, if the drinks worked at all that is.<br />
<br />
He started by turning to his left to focus on the portly, old man who arrived soon after he did, the one called Frank. He had ordered a Youthenizer and was gulping it down like a pro. Jason was stunned and amazed to see the man actually looked a decade younger than when he first sat down. His pure white beard was now stained with red patches as its original colour returned. His gleaming scalp was sparsely coated with thin hairs which seemed to increase in number before his eyes. His rough, wrinkled skin was looking more smooth and youthful by the second.  Even his once taut shirt was getting baggier on his slimming torso. If he hadn&#39;t been given the welcoming spiel, Jason would probably have assumed it was his imagination, but Frank really was getting younger before his very eyes. The man spotted him watching his transformation and gave him the stink eye. &quot;You won&#39;t be wanting any of this, lad&quot; he muttered. &quot;You barely look old enough to be in here as it is, let alone thinking about getting any younger. I don&#39;t want no bawling brats in here&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jason scowled at his words, a bit touchy about his perpetually young appearance. Even with his feeble attempt at growing facial hair, which was barely chin scruff that grew sparser along the jaw, he was still carded whenever he went out anywhere fun. Friends and family, even strangers, said they wished they could look so young and that he&#39;d appreciate his baby-face in a couple of decades, but the reality wasn&#39;t as fun as it looked. Tina came back and shooed the youthening man away. She leant on the counter and said &quot;Don&#39;t pay attention to Frank, he may end up looking younger but he&#39;ll always act like a crotchety old man. I have no limits on who can order what in here. I even have a crib out back for those who want to go back to babyhood, if that&#39;s what you&#39;d like&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jason shook his head violently. &quot;No, that sort of thing is not for me. What has everyone else ordered in here&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What haven&#39;t they ordered is a better question&quot;. Tina pointed to a petite, blonde woman who sat alone in the far corner, nursing a small, bubblegum colored drink. With every small sip, she seemed to get subtly bustier, somewhat curvier and more enticing in appearance. &quot;Andrea over there comes in every so often to order a Gender Bender, male to female of course, followed by a small Eve&#39;s Delight to enhance her femininity. I told her that it&#39;s gotta be easier to just transition but she says she&#39;s gender-fluid? I dunno, just make sure you use the correct pronouns and you&#39;ll get along with her just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nodded, not too sure about being the opposite gender himself, even if just for the night. He liked having a penis far too much to give it up. &quot;What about those two guys over there?&quot;. He pointed to a small table that looked like the visual start of a joke. One man was incredibly tall, pushing 7ft at the very least. He was only wearing a pair of underwear, his body looked uncomfortably underweight as his rib-cage was showing and his limbs looked almost skeletal. Yet he was cheerful and doubled-over in laughter at his friend, who looked the complete opposite to him. He was a very short and incredibly squat man, practically swimming in his oversized T-shirt like a preschooler dressed in his dad&#39;s clothes, if said preschooler had a black goatee and shaved head..<br />
<br />
Tina rolled her eyes. &quot;Well obviously Barry and Paul ordered the Grow-Juice and the Shrinker-Dink respectively. They don&#39;t get together often but when they do, things can get a little out of hand. This is usually just the beginning. Soon they&#39;ll break out the weight adjusters and I&#39;ll have to keep tabs on them for the rest of the night in case they go overboard. I can handle one of them turning bug sized but I don&#39;t want them re-enacting King Kong again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason took note of the strange men. It could be fun shrinking to the size of an ant, or growing as big as a giant, but probably not for his first drink. Tina could feel his uncertainty and said &quot;No dice on the height adjustment huh? You know, I have a feeling this is more your style&quot;. She pointed towards a man sitting by himself on the other side of the bar, sipping on a half empty glass of foamy black liquid. He looked to be in his mid forties with a burly, hirsute body that filled out the white vest we wore, a week&#39;s worth of greying stubble coated his rugged cheeks. It took Jason a moment to realise it was the teenager who entered the bar several moments ago. As he drank his drink, Jason could see his hair dull in colour while his forehead grew larger as his hairline receded backwards. &quot;Harry over here used to be even younger than you if you&#39;d believe it. He only just graduated high school but as I say, I have no limits on who orders what. Luckily the Older Ale is just in name, It&#39;s really non-alcoholic. Not that it matters now, since he&#39;s more than double the drinking age for the night&quot;. <br />
<br />
Harry noticed the two of them watching him drink in the large mirror opposite the bar. He turned in his seat, giving Jason a nervous smile. He took a long sip from his glass, followed by a thumbs up towards its effects. While the former-teen quickly aged closer towards his fifties, Jason scratched his chin scruff in thought. The thought of getting older was more appealing to him than getting younger, even if just to see if he kept his baby-faced demeanour once he reached his parents&#39; age like everyone predicted. Yet he also wasn&#39;t in a big rush to grow up. He put the idea on the back-burner for now. Tina had left him again, filling a glass up with a powder blue liquid from a bottle labelled Fat Burner for an overly eager obese man. Without her guidance, Jason let his eyes roam the room for other unusual sights.<br />
<br />
As he turned his head to his right, Jason was taken by surprise. There was what looked to be a person sat at a table partially wearing an animal costume. They had a human body but the head of a grey wolf. It was highly realistic since he could see the black eyes blink and the wet nose on its long muzzle sniffle. It could even open its jaws to pour the amber coloured drink down its throat. It wasn&#39;t until Jason saw the same grey fur rapidly sprout down the person&#39;s exposed arms that he realised it wasn&#39;t a costume at all. Tina must have sensed his fear since she suddenly grabbed his shoulder and turned him towards her. &quot;Now now, it&#39;s rude to stare you know. But what do ya think? It&#39;s one of my anthro specialities, Big Bad Wolf.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jason risked a glance back towards the wolfman to see they&#39;d finished their drink and had crossed the room to chat to a more stunning looking Andrea. He stuttered &quot;People can become animals too!?&quot; His mind wandered to the unconfirmed sightings of beast men in the area. He always thought it was supernatural hogwash but did this mean it was really just patrons of the transformation bar?<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they can! You think I&#39;d just ignore a large proportion of my visitors? Loads of people want to be animals for the night! Usually just a partial change like Wolfy over there but some like to go the full hog. Of course, they all keep their human minds, I can&#39;t just set wild animals loose in here. And I have a safe passageway to the woods outside town for those wanting the full experience&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but, how does it... How do they...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t overthink it. I give them a drink, they turn into whatever they want, everyone&#39;s happy. I even have a few drinks that can turn people into inanimate objects if they so wish. It&#39;s dangerous but I&#39;m providing a chance for people to experience their wildest dreams. Anything goes here, remember that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s head was spinning at what he&#39;d been shown in the past half hour. People changing ages, changing genders, changing species? It was all too much to take in. He threw his arms onto the bar and slumped his head into them. In the large mirror, he spotted what looked like a hen party occurring at the back of the bar. The women had multiple shots on the table and were playing some sort of Russian Roulette game. He noticed they were all wearing white bunny ear headbands except for one girl who appeared to have large, black cat ears on either side of her head. Another woman had a ludicrously sculpted moustache above her thick lips. And it could just be his poor eyesight but it looked like the bride-to-be had three breasts uncomfortably stuffed inside her tight shirt. Tina noticed his gaze and explained &quot;Each shot can cause a random change to a random body part. Although It&#39;s better suited to a group of people over single guys such as yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
A man in his mid-twenties came up to the bar and sat beside Jason. He had a head of thick, fiery red hair that accompanied his large, ginger beard. More red hair mixed with freckles across his lean arms that looked tiny in the very baggy shirt he was wearing. Jason immediately recognized the hairy man to be Frank after having finished his Youthenizer. &quot;You still haven&#39;t made a decision then lad?&quot; he asked rather condescendingly. He shook his head and tutted, then looked him up and down. &quot;You are a scrawny little thing ain&#39;t ya? Tina, I say you should just give him the Mountain Man and let him be done with it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jason perked up at the name, sitting up straight and looking over the drinks once again. &quot;Mountain Man? I don&#39;t remember seeing that one on offer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tina leaned against the bar and shot Frank a nasty look &quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s not a single drink. It&#39;s a speciality cocktail made with a mix of my finest manly traits. Let&#39;s see, there&#39;s Older Ale, Muscle Toner, Belly Buster, Fuzz Muster, TestosteGrow, Adam&#39;s Delight, Grow-Juice, Leather Layers, Worker&#39;s Qualm, and Mount Baldy&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s a lot. And what does it do?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes you a mountain man of course. The sort of guy you&#39;d expect to see living in the forest, who could tear a tree in half and get in a fist fight with a bear. But a newbie such as yourself would be better off sticking to the single drinks for now. The specialities are far too much for you to handle for your first drink&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jason felt a bit offended that she figured he couldn&#39;t handle such a drink. Or any other speciality she had been keeping from him. Sure he almost passed out after seeing the friendly wolfman but that was different. &quot;You said that nothing was off-limits for anyone in here. So what other specialities do you have?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tina groaned at the question. It was going to be a long night with this kid. &quot;Nothing is off-limits but that doesn&#39;t mean everything&#39;s a good idea. But hey, it&#39;s your choice. Why don&#39;t I just give you the list and you can make up your own mind. But better make it snappy before I just kick you to the curb&quot;.</p>
