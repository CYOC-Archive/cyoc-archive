<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daryn rubbed his eyes before noticing the 7&#39;5&quot; naked demoness standing in front of him. Terrified by the succubus&#39;s sudden appearance he fell backwards dropping the book. &quot;W-what where am I&quot; the succubus asked as she looked around, despite her brutal appearance her voice was beautiful almost angelic. &quot;How is this possible no one should have been able to free me&quot; she said before she turned her attention to Daryn who was now siting on the floor. &quot;A human, so I&#39;m back in the mortal realm&quot; the demon pondered out loud examining the young boy who was staring at her with a mix of arousal and fear (mostly fear). <br />
<br />
The succubus walked up to Daryn making him move away desperately trying to keep his distance. She stopped, letting out a sigh and looking down at herself &quot;dose my form frighten you young one?&quot; She ran a clawed talon like hand over her nude flesh &quot;this body, it is the result of millennia of torment and suffering.&quot; &quot;I thought that I was going to be trapped there for all eternity&quot; she said before crouching down in a somewhat vain attempt to look less threatening. &quot;But you saved me, pleas for your own sake you need to tell me how you did this&quot; she asked a tone of concern in her voice. Daryn hesitated for a moment before pointing to the book that now laid on the floor next to the muscular succubus&#39;s feet. She picked up the book and began to scroll through the pages &quot;how strange, who would have made such a thing?&quot; <br />
<br />
Her face sifted to one of confusion as she turned to the succubus page &quot;how did they know what I look like, I didn&#39;t take on this form unlit my imprisonment in Hell?!&quot; The more she studied the page the more her expression changed to one of concern &quot;this spell it was meant to summon the nearest succubus, any succubus it shouldn&#39;t have summoned me... unless.&quot; She held her hand over the book, a moment of hesitation overtook her before she finally placed her hand on the book triggering a bright flash like before. After the light had faded both Daryn and the succubus looked around the room to find that no other succubi had appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; she whimpered before once again placing her hand on the page. Again and again she tried to summon a succubus and each time nothing. After awhile she began to cry out names as tears fall from her dark eyes &quot;Kali, Naamah, Bale, Kera, Lily.&quot; Finally she allowed the book to drop as she fell to her hands and knees sobbing &quot;NOOO my beautiful children.&quot; Daryn after realizing what&#39;s happening decided to get up and carefully walked over to the grieving demon. &quot;Are you okay&quot; he asked feeling somewhat responsible for this hole situation. &quot;No&quot; she sobbed &quot;all of them... murdered... and for what... some perfect world dictated by that... monster!&quot; &quot;I-I&#39;m so sorry&quot; Daryn said backing up a bit as she started to get angry. The succubus took a deep breath to calm herself down before looking at him &quot;pleas don&#39;t apologize&quot; she said. &quot;I may have learned a horrific truth, but you freed me from a fate worse than oblivion and for that I am in your debt.&quot; <br />
<br />
The succubus sat down trying her best to stay calm &quot;I&#39;m Lilith by the way&quot; she said. &quot;Daryn&quot; the boy replied feeling a little more comfortable with the situation. Her attention turned to the gold chains as she ran her hand along the links &quot;do you know what these are Daryn&quot; she asked. &quot;Sexy jewelry&quot; he said meekly feeling himself starting to get turned on. &quot;Hehehe, yeas but this is also what&#39;s left of my divinity&quot; Lilith said &quot;I was once an angel you see.&quot; &quot;Me and some others didn&#39;t agree with yaldabaoth&#39;s plans for humanity so we betrayed him and fled to your realm.&quot; &quot;in an act of rebellion I guess we decided to wear our divinity in a lewd form of mockery.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her hand tightened around the chain &quot;but it was eventually used against us, we were dragged and bound to hell by our own divinity.&quot; She looked down at the floor ashamed &quot;it was during my torment when I realized the truth, we were to afraid to give up on what we once were, we always heled out hope that we could return.&quot; Her face hardened as she grasped the chains in her hand &quot;but now, after everything that monster has done to me, after the genocide of my beloved children, there is no going back.&quot; &quot;I renounce my divinity&quot; Lilith said before ripping the chains from her body casing them to break into golden dust that quickly faded from existence. Black blood dripped from her nipples and clit as she fell to the floor and began to shiver and convulse. <br />
<br />
&quot;L-Lilith are you okay&quot; Daryn asked as he kneeled down next to the muscular succubus placing a hand on her solder. She took a beep breath as she steadied herself &quot;I&#39;m okay... thank you Daryn&quot; Lilith said before siting back up her wounds having already healed. &quot;You&#39;ve been so kind to me, and I of course I am still in your debt for freeing me&quot; she said as her hand moved down to her pussy and began to pleaser herself &quot;ohhh so Daryn tell me, mmm are you a virgin.&quot; He shifted uncomfortably as his pants began to feel tighter &quot;I-I am.&quot; &quot;Hehehe would you like to have your first time with a sex demon&quot; she asked fluid now dripping from her cunt. Daryn moved between her legs his boner pressing tightly against his pants &quot;your not going to suck out my soul are you?&quot; She let out a long sigh before answering &quot;That was an unfortunate defect that my children were forced to endure.&quot; &quot;I was never able to give them souls of their own&quot; she said sadly &quot;as a result they were forced to feed on the life force of humans to sustain them selves.&quot; &quot;Even though it is now completely stained by darkness I do posses a soul of my own&quot; Lilith said. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Daryn pleas don&#39;t be afraid, I will not hurt you&quot; she said before spreading open her pussy. No logger able to resist Daryn began to strip reviling his hardened member before kneeling in front of the demon&#39;s wet entrance. Having have watched quite a bit of porn before he had some understanding of what he needed to do as he began to rub his penis against her vulva. Lilith let out a soft moan as he slipped into her &quot;mmm it&#39;s been so long, I&#39;ve almost forgotten just how good this feels&quot; she said. Almost the moment he felt her warm insides he orgasmed squirting thick ropes of cum inside the succubus. &quot;Hehehe well that was anticlimactic&quot; she said before moving the spaded tip of her tail to his face &quot;here lick this it&#39;ll help improve your stamina.&quot; Daryn took the spade in his hand bringing it up to his face, it was red like the rest of the demon but was covered in pulsating veins. <br />
<br />
He gave it a lick eliciting a moan from Lilith, the spade began to throb and swell before it finally opened up like a flower. The pink insides were soft and moist looking almost like a pussy, in the center was a small opening that produced a clear sweet smelting fluid. Daryn began to lick up the fluid enjoying the sweet taste as it spilled down his throat. Almost immediately he began to feel his dick swell up growing bigger and harder than it had before. It became difficult to think as his mind became filled with thoughts of sex driving him to slid his throbbing penis in and out of her wet cunt. He began to moan as his hips began to thrust uncontrollably into the succubus&#39;s wet pussy moving faster and rougher each time. The library quickly became filed with the sounds of sex and moaning as they continued to fuck.</p>
