<br />
You returned to your friends, rings in hand. Jack, Tom, and Max are still laughing at the same joke condoms they had been. In fact, it seemed to you as though you&#39;d never left them. Jack was finishing the same stupid pun about the banana print condom he had been saying when you&#39;d walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess Susan would finally find you a-peel-ing, huh Tom?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two booed him for the bad pun while you debated how you could get them to wear the rings. Jack noticed you hadn&#39;t joined their normal bad-joke routine and slid over next to you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha got there, bud?&quot; he asked, pointing to your clenched hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh, these?&quot; you separated the gold one and showed them the silver rings. &quot;I found these rings on the shelf and thought they looked kind of cool. You want to try them on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not here, obviously,&quot; Tom pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? They&#39;re just rings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, the poor bastard has no idea,&quot; Max lamented sarcastically. &quot;They&#39;re cock rings, you idiot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! What, did you think a store full of kinky sex toys was going to have plain, actual jewelry, too?&quot; Jack laughed. &quot;Tell you what, let&#39;s get these and show Luke here what he&#39;s missing out on.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the counter, the old man was there with a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evening, lads! Since this is your first time, you can take those for free. Just make sure you consider me for any of your future needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, thanks old man!&quot; the other three exclaimed various surprised gratitude at his generosity while he merely winked at you. <br />
<br />
When you got back to the dorm, the four of you locked the door and took out your rings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boys, let&#39;s be mature about this,&quot; Tom guided. &quot;No making fun of each other or goofing off, this is strictly educational. We don&#39;t need to start a fight with small pecker jokes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, aye, Captain!&quot; Jack replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;No promises,&quot; Max smirked. <br />
<br />
You just gulped nervously, your gold ring in hand. You realized now it was much to big to go on a finger, but it was finely engraved and sculpted like a high-quality ring you would find in a jewelry store. The others noticed as well and wondered how the old man could afford to give such extravagant gifts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You found a gold one?&quot; Max questioned you. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything? Gold&#39;s more my color.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your color?&quot; Jack snickered. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize we bunked with RuPaul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!&quot; Tom exclaimed, ever the moderator. &quot;What did I just say about fighting? Who the fuck cares what color your cock ring is?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two exchanged half-serious glares, but eventually it was time to begin. Jack, Tom, and Max all stripped relatively quickly, revealing their sexy bodies. <br />
<br />
Jack was a little chubby, but built, with tree-trunk legs and broad arms. His curly auburn hair covered his entire body, including a long beard and mustache. He looked like a real man&#39;s man and his thick, uncut cock hung pendulously between his legs. <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s body was more refined, his lithe figure and toned muscles the result of years of athletic talent and practice. His short blonde hair and blue eyes showed off his Nordic genes. He kept himself shaved for his girlfriend and his circumcised snake was longer than Jack&#39;s, but not as thick.<br />
<br />
Max was the youngest of the group, a freshman who got bunked with two seniors and a junior. As such, he still looked young and sweet, despite his fiery attitude. He was also naturally hairless, his only hair the soft mat of brown on top of his head. He was more tan than the other two and his uncut cock was smaller than the others&#39;, but still average.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Luke, don&#39;t be afraid!&quot; Jack encouraged you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, man, don&#39;t wimp out now!&quot; Max added. <br />
<br />
Despite your fear and embarrassment, you managed to finish undressing. As you stood naked in front of your hot, nude friends, you realized the stress was actually helping you not get an erection from the extremely erotic situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, dude...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn! You&#39;re fucking hung!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite your average frame and looks, you did indeed carry a hefty package. One of the reasons you had to try so hard to keep calm was because your member was impossible to hide when erect. Now your friends, who were much sexier than you, were ogling your much bigger cock, making it very difficult to remain flaccid. <br />
<br />
&quot;How you don&#39;t have a girlfriend is beyond me, Luke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, chicks would be all over you if they knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, let&#39;s not worship it, damn,&quot; Tom broke in. &quot;You want to learn how to use these or not? I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s used one, right?&quot; You, Jack and Max confirm this. &quot;Okay, so, you have to put them on before you get erect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each of you slipped on the band of metal which miraculously seemed to accommodate your various sizes despite looking the same in the store. The feel of cool metal on skin was strangely erotic, giving each of you the beginnings of a semi-hardon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now just get yourself to full mast and the ring will keep the blood in your cock, allowing you to maintain your erection longer. But don&#39;t go over, like, a half hour, cause then you&#39;ll fuck your dick up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom then went to slip the ring off, but realized that in the short time he&#39;d been talking his penis was already fully erect. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, well, I guess I&#39;m stuck in mine. Should go down in a minute or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t. In fact, everyone&#39;s was completely rigid, and you personally had never had such a powerful erection. Apparently, the feeling was mutual, as you noticed the look of discomfort on your friends&#39; faces. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, man, it won&#39;t go down!&quot; Max said, a hint of a moan behind his voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me either, and I&#39;ve been thinking of elephant births to get rid of it,&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew,&quot; you all replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it normally works!&quot;<br />
<br />
After some more time, it was clear you weren&#39;t getting rid of your boners anytime soon. The four of you squirmed in discomfort, trying to keep from touching yourselves despite the immense pleasure in your crotches. Finally, Jack couldn&#39;t take it anymore and began furiously masturbating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, what the fuck, dude!&quot; Max turned away. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, man, but I can&#39;t ignore it any longer!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it,&quot; Tom said, normally the calm, collected one. &quot;I&#39;m doing it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even you found yourself breaking down and gave in to the pleasure, stroking yourself with your roommates.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck, I guess I&#39;ll do it too then,&quot; Max gave in, jerking off as well.<br />
<br />
This was the hottest thing you could imagine: all three of your roommates masturbating beside you. But you couldn&#39;t enjoy the moment because you seemed to be unable to reach release. The pressure continued to build and build, your cock almost sore from the strain, when you suddenly noticed the lack of a ring. Forcing yourself to stop masturbating, you pull your hand away from your throbbing member to see that the ring had merged into your penis, becoming what looked like a golden tattoo at the base of your shaft in the same pattern as the ring.<br />
<br />
Shocked, you looked at your friends and saw between their strokes that theirs had absorbed into them as well, though they didn&#39;t seem to notice. They were too busy moaning in mixed pleasure and pain, stroking themselves futilely. Your own cock was begging for your attention again and something told you to go back to stroking. You did so, and ass soon as you reached a nice pace, all four of you screamed out in ecstasy as you simultaneously came, splattering the apartment with your seed.<br />
<br />
The excitement left each of you panting; you fell back, weak-kneed, onto the communal sofa. When you opened your eyes again, you started at the sight of your friends, all standing above you, looking at your crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, guys, what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s so big,&quot; Max breathed quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s bigger than any of ours,&quot; Jack added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, cut it out! You&#39;re embarrassing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it like to be that big?&quot; Tom asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, fine, I guess...&quot; you realized there was something unusual about their voices, sensual, but almost dazed. They didn&#39;t seem to understand what was going on either, but they continued to gawk at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I can&#39;t stop staring, man,&quot; Max admitted. &quot;I just want to look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, but, I want to...touch you...&quot; Jack trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;May we...touch you.........Master?&quot; Tom asked shyly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot; You definitely knew there was something weird now and sat up straight. &quot;Why did you call me that? Why do you want to touch me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just so perfect, Master,&quot; Max said now, &quot;we want to touch your greatness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Master,&quot; Jack begged, &quot;let us serve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Serve me? I don&#39;t...oh shit!&quot; you gasp loudly as Max lunges forward and licks your shaft from base to tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no fair!&quot; Jack pushes Max aside. &quot;I want to taste him!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two finally settle next to each other, both of their mouths caressing your shaft. Tom sits on the couch next to you, stroking your bare chest. You look to him and he pulls you into a long, wet kiss. At first you resist, realizing this isn&#39;t normal, but you soon stop struggling: this wasn&#39;t supposed to be normal.<br />
<br />
The old man had promised you the rings would change your relationship with your friends, and it had. This was exactly what you wanted: three horny friends willing to get it on with you. When you reached this conclusion, there was nothing left to do but join the fun. <br />
<br />
You grabbed Tom by the back of the head and pulled him into a French kiss, invading his mouth with your tongue. He sighed happily as you took command of him. You then motioned for Max to take your member and Jack to lick your rear. They willingly obeyed as you broke your kiss with Tom and told him to kneel on the couch next to you. When he had, you began to suck him off, his own sizable member filling your mouth. Tom came first, giving you a taste of his sweet seed, and not long after you filled Max&#39;s mouth with your own man syrup. <br />
<br />
Now you stood, eager to move onto your erotic fantasy. You moved Max in front of you, Tom behind you, and Jack behind Tom. You shared your plan for a train, which everyone was more than happy to join. You penetrated Max first, his younger frame smaller and soft to the touch. He whined softly as you entered, only turning you on more. Then the athletic Tom entered you, his firm grasp and toned body embracing you. And lastly, Jack entered Tom; the &quot;engine&quot; in the &quot;caboose&quot; of this train. Each of you, thrusting inside the others, was more than enough to send you all over the edge and after a long, blissful session, you each filled your friends and lay down on the floor in a big group, covered in each other&#39;s spunk and falling asleep.</p>
