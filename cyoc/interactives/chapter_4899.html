<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you want to do to him, Jenn?&quot; Trish asked.  Jennifer answered, &quot;I want him to be embarrassed.  I want him to be humiliated.  I want him...&quot; she tailed off.  Jennifer thought to herself.  She wasn't humiliated, really.  Sure, some people made some comments.  But there was always a few people who had less than complimentary words for her.  And no one was aware of her clothes shedding problem except for her three friends.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Jenn?&quot; Liz asked.  &quot;I was just thinking.  You know, I wasn't really embarrassed at all.  Or humiliated.&quot;  Liz said, &quot;But you said people made comments to you?  Doesn't that make you pretty pissed?&quot;  &quot;Not really,&quot; Jennifer answered.  &quot;A few of those assholes always make some comments to me.  I didn't really get anything out of the ordinary.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jamie wasn't so sure.  &quot;Jenn, they accused you of having your breasts enhanced.  That's pretty damn low.&quot;  Jennifer said, &quot;Yea, but you know what?  The same thing happened before sophomore year.  I developed a lot that summer.  You know that, Trish, because we practically spent that whole summer together.&quot;  Trish confirmed what she said.  &quot;Yea that's true.  I remember you wanted to quit school you were so mad at everyone.&quot;  Liz and Jamie had never known that.  They remembered some of what Jennifer had endured at that time.  Neither knew that was how much it had affected their friend, the one who was always so quick to put other people in their place, who never seemed, on the surface, to let anything said to her faze her in any way.  &quot;OK then,&quot; Jamie said.  &quot;How should he be punished then?&quot;  Jennifer still wasn't sure.  &quot;I don't know yet.  But we'll think of something.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can we put our clothes on again?&quot; Liz asked.  &quot;Let's see,&quot; said Jamie.  She picked up her thong and put her right foot through it, pulling it up her leg.  Then she put her left foot through the hole, and pulled the thong back over her legs, covering her womanhood.  &quot;I guess that answers that,&quot; she said.  Trish and Liz did the same.  Jennifer tried to but could not.  &quot;What the hell?&quot; she wondered.  Then Jamie remembered how they worded their curses.  &quot;Jenn, we all said to return to our normal selves.  But you were told to return to how Kyle cursed you.  That's probably why.&quot;  Trish said, &quot;Well that's easy enough to correct.  Transform or Dare, Jenn?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare,&quot; replied Jenn.  Trish said, &quot;Jenn, I dare you to put your clothes back on and not take them off again until you want to, it is absolutely necessary, or one of the three of us Dares you otherwise.&quot;  Jennifer wasn't sure of why Trish added that last little bit, but she quickly grabbed up the her clothes and redressed herself.  She decided to ask, &quot;Trish why did you add that part about one of you daring me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish had developed an idea in her head.  She just wasn't sure if it could be done.  &quot;Remember when I told you guys I'd just rather be naked?&quot;  They nodded.  &quot;Well I wasn't kidding.  I love my body.  I love to flaunt it.  Walking around nude is the ultimate way of showing off my goods,&quot; she said as she ran her hands up and down her voluptuous body.  &quot;I'd like to see if it's possible.&quot;  Her friends looked at her like she was crazy.  <br />
<br />
Jamie called her on it first.  &quot;Just how do you think you would ever be able to get away with that?  And anyway, what's the point of going nude?  You'd freeze in the winter.  And if you don't wear anything on your feet, you could step on something.&quot;  Jamie had resorted to practicality in order to convince her friend she wasn't thinking clearly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie, we have this curse to use.  We can achieve any means we want,&quot; Trish reasoned.  Liz offered her two cents.  &quot;Trish, I don't think so.  We can change each other's looks or personality one at a time.  But how could we make everyone think that being nude all the time is normal?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Trish thought for a second.  &quot;We'd have to test it.  Jenn, you have the curse now.  Ask me, and I'll pick Dare.  There's only one way we're going to know for sure.  You'll have to say it like this: Trish I dare you to be able to go nude wherever you want to and only you, I, and Liz will think there's something wrong with it.&quot;  She turned to Jamie and said, &quot;This way you would think nothing is out of the ordinary if it works.  Right?&quot;  Jamie looked a Trish, thought for a moment, and said, &quot;I guess.  There's only one way to find out.&quot;  Trish smiled.<br />
<br />
She quickly removed her clothes once again, showing off her naked body to her friends.  Now it was time to see just how easily this curse could alter people's perceptions.  Jennifer spoke the curse just as Trish told her to say it.  Trish would be able to be nude anywhere she wanted with only herself, Jennifer, and Liz thinking anything of it. <br />
<br />
Jennifer spoke the curse.  Trish turned to Jamie and said, &quot;Jamie, is there anything strange about the way I'm dressed?&quot;  Jamie shook her head, somewhat bewildered, and said, &quot;Trish you aren't dressed.  You're nude.&quot;  Liz sighed with frustration and asked, &quot;Jamie, do you find it strange that while we're all dressed Trish is standing here nude?&quot;  Again Jamie didn't give the answer they were looking for.  &quot;Well we've all been nude most of the day.&quot;  Liz asked again, with impatience, &quot;Jamie, if Trish walked into the school right now as she is, fully nude, where everyone, students and teachers could see her would you think there was anything strange about it?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jamie answered, &quot;No.  What's wrong with her going to school nude?&quot;  Trish exclaimed with delight, &quot;It works!&quot;  Perplexed by Trish's excitement, Jamie asked &quot;What works?&quot;  Said Trish, &quot;Jenn dared me to be able to go nude anywhere I wanted and that only me, her and Liz would think it was weird.  It worked.&quot;  Jamie, still confused, said, &quot;Oh.  Well that's good I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish gathered her clothes back up and redressed herself.  &quot;What time is it Jamie,&quot; she asked.  &quot;It's 2:30,&quot; she replied.  &quot;That probably gives us enough time to go find Kyle's address and get there by the time he gets home.&quot;  Jennifer smiled and said, &quot;Great.  I think I've come up with just the plan.  But first, you'd better give me that same curse, Trish.&quot;  &quot;Why?&quot; Trish asked.  &quot;Uhhhh,&quot; Jennifer groaned.  &quot;Don't you remember?  We're going to trick Kyle into thinking that his curse has worked, I don't think anything's wrong and then--Wham!--we give it to him.&quot;  Trish then asked, &quot;So what does that have to do with you being--ohhh.&quot;  She had an epiphany mid-sentence.  &quot;Just in case anyone else sees you naked.  Great idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then?&quot; Jennifer asked impatiently.  &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; Trish said.  Jennifer replied, &quot;Dare.&quot;  Trish gave it to her: &quot;Jennifer I dare you to be able to go nude anywhere you want to and only you, myself, Liz, and Jamie will think that it is out of the ordinary.&quot;  The curse took effect, and this time Jamie could be in on the joke.  &quot;Alright then,&quot; Jennifer said.  &quot;Here's the deal.  You all are just going to have to follow my lead once I ask him.  This is what we're going to do...&quot;</p>
