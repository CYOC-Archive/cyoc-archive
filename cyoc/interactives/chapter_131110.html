<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon continued his playful loving of Lulu, as did then Frank and Charlie took to toying with Arron, their equal, he then a she Mule, feeling uproariously horny while sterile. Arron was heard squealing from sensual joy most any time by day or during the night when she would urinate and the two geldings smelling it, ran after her, mounting and mating with her.<br />
<br />
The small farm was teaming with equine lives. As Damon acted like a common pony stallion when in the company of Lulu, he stayed near her as much as he could. Arron though felt his/her new nympho-lust for having a big cock shoved inside and tracking deep in her mule body. She did not discriminate when it came to her lovers, she would want or try to get any male to feeling aroused. Arron would spit a stream of urine for Frank or Charlie almost anytime during the day when together standing in the pasture.<br />
<br />
Arron would do her best to beckon even her elder brother to try and mate with her. The nasty job of keeping the stables stalls kept clean of manure droppings was Arron&#39;s job, but he changed into a female Mule meant his duties of doing work using any human made utensils was a thing of the past. Instead, Arron feeling as damned to being constantly horny, she would let go a short or long stream of her aromatic urine, aiming her rear to try and have her piss soak her elder brother or even her friendly still father.<br />
<br />
Twice, as two different times when the ponies were being led to their respective stalls inside the crowded stable, that as Damon was about to walk past the nearby rump of Arron, she would spew before Damon a puddle of her rank to strong scented urine onto the stables floor.<br />
<br />
Urine sniffing was a common method used by Lulu to coax her betrothed to come and quell her senses of equine mare passion. So, when Arron used the same ploy, Damon the stallion would stop to take a sniff of the stinking puddle. The rank scent sparked in Damon the same way it did to Charlie or Frank, and Damon then reciprocated. Damon knew where his stables stall was, and he usually was let to walk there without the used of a tethered rein to lead a dumb animal. Damon was not ignorant, nor was he human, but a real pony stallion. As such a stallion that down deep in his soul he could not deny the urge to mate after having sniffed the urine of a mare or jennet Mule.<br />
<br />
Twice, Damon stopped his walking toward his stall only to stop behind Arron. He would reach his muzzle to give Arron an affectionate sniff about her rump. A second spurt of mule urine would coat the muzzle of Damon, sparking in him an undeniable drive of want to mate with a female equine.<br />
<br />
Without much rational thought, Damon would then mount up and over the rump of Arron, as his pony stallion libido aroused his cock to an instantaneous full flagging erection. Damon had-had a lot of practice poking his cock inside Lulu while doing it blindly, not able to see of, as watch where his cock would go when trying to breed with a mare.<br />
<br />
Arron would squeal her feelings of delight as a larger cock than she felt from Charlie or Frank was entering her mule cunt. Damon, her brother being a stallion and not a gelding, his cock when used for mating did swell, bloating larger, the blunt end flaring, it expanding to resemble the bell end of a trumpet.  It was the bell shaped end of the pony cock that worked inside her vagina like the driving rod of a piston. The bloated bell end to the cock stroked the ribbed muscular walls of the vagina, while helping to suck the deeper set lips of a womb that had no eggs capable of becoming inseminated.<br />
<br />
Although Damon was fully aware the Mule of being his brother as magically changed into a female form, the drive to breed, to mate after smelling of mare urine was something he as a stallion could not deny or ignore.<br />
<br />
Damon got anything he wanted while he was a pony. His father made it known that the young stallion had full reign of the farm and could handle the other ponies or the mule as he saw fit to do. Damon did appreciate the open reign gifted to him, as he being a stallion had feelings of dominance. When Damon stood mounted, he humped over the rump of Arron the Mule, nobody tried to sway his attention from mating. Damon might get to an orgasm and fire his load of semen after a couple of minutes, or as he did to Arron, Damon remained sunken deep and his cock thrusting for longer than an hour of sexual play.<br />
<br />
Arron and Damon though born as brothers to the same parents, were never close, in factual ways, they were profound enemies about most anything to do with what the family wanted or did as a family to enjoy. The father knew as did the one remaining brother of  the mutual attitude of dislike between Arron and Damon, as they allowed Damon to sexually dominate his jennet Mule brother, as Damon stood brutally fucking Arron until the Mule began to cry shrill brays as Damon stood thrusting hard.<br />
<br />
All the meanwhile the mother to her sons was busily struggling to inform the relatives as to ask them to attend a wedding ceremony for her son and the pretty female he had chosen to live beside for his future. Dear Mom was not so foolish to inform her family relatives that her son and his girlfriend were in fact as equine animals, and not wholly holy humans.<br />
<br />
The great day chosen was fast approaching and some rather strange gifts were arriving ahead of the expected guests to a farm wedding. Some of those contacted about the wedding noted the gift registries were posted at odd stores, such stores as Farm Bureau Supply, and Tractor Supply, or Molly Haas Equestrian shop. Mom sent out thirty-eight invitations to the wedding set for a Sunday afternoon, at the farm, and held inside the stables.  As the wedding day was but three days before the date chosen, the gifts arriving came with sad notes of the relatives deciding as not to come to the wedding.<br />
<br />
Gifts were many and all had to do with the owning of horses. Horse toys, head halters with sequence sparkling buttons, and a pony size saddle sent by a dear Auntie Grace. As from thirty-eight invitations sent, only seven reported their plan was to attend the ceremony; as this made Mom turn angry.<br />
<br />
When troubles outwitted Mom, she turned to the genie-lamp and aroused the magical creature from his napping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie, oh Genie I need your help!&quot;  Father happening to overhear his wife beckoning the Genie to appear and gift her something she had as a need.<br />
<br />
Purple smoke that smelled of Violets then filled the room as the Genie awoke and came out of his lamp-condo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yawn, ah yes Madam, what is your wish?&quot;  Genie said, as he stood there floating in the air, while rubbing his eyes with two fists, and the purple smoke rising behind him was blasted by a harsh expelled genie style fart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Genie please, I have every few of our relatives coming to the wedding for Damon and Lulu, and I wish that they shall see my son and his betrothed as if they were all a kin, as similar relatives one to another, please make it happen properly!&quot; Dad heard his worried wife ask.</p>
