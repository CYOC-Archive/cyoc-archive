<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Feeling as though Jeremy were falling asleep, Jeremy shot straight up out of the bed 
and rubbed his eyes. In what was maybe a couple seconds to a full minute, he had already 
accumulated a bit of the eye crust one gets from 
sleeping. Thinking it would be best just to leave, not wanting to incur the wrath of the 
house itself, Jeremy gets up onto his feet and starts to leave when he notices that the 
room is different now. Instead of everything being covered 
in cobwebs and years of dust, everything looked new and vibrant, as if he were in the 
house when the owner lived. Finding all of this just a little bit strange, Jeremy proceeded 
to the door, but stopped in his tracks when the door 
opened and a man stepped into the bedroom.</Br>
<Br>Startled by this intrusion, on both ends, Jeremy and the man looked at each other for 
a second trying to figure out what was going on. Before Jeremy even had the time to say 
something, the man spoke. He had what sounded 
like a mid range voice; deep, but average with what Jeremy knew to be an old time tone 
used in their vernacular.</Br>
<Br>"Son, what are you doing in my room, let alone my house? I have been here all day 
and I would have seen you come in through the only door I got here, so spill it."</Br>
<Br>Worried for his life, just a bit, Jeremy started to stutter. "S... Ss... sir I... I don't kn... 
know. I... I am a... a bit con... confused."</Br>
<Br>"Why don't you just stop all of your stutterin' and speak. I am not gonna harm you, 
but I might if you keep it up." The man finished with a sly and mischievous grin.</Br>
<Br>Jeremy swallowed hard, composed himself and decided to start over. "Sir, I don't 
know. I am a bit confused."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, yes... I heard you the first time, now continue."</Br>
<Br>"Well me and my friend Mike came into this house to test our courage. You see, the 
house I was in, that looked an awful lot like this one, was old and abandoned. While 
walking around, I saw a light come from this door and I 
went to inspect it while Mike went off to do his own thing. When I came in here, I wanted 
to lay on the bed and imagine myself as you, the owner. When I did so, I felt a nice 
tingling sensation course through my body from what I 
would suspect would have been the moonlight from the full moon. Then I fell asleep for 
what I thought was a second and then I ended up here. That is all I can tell you, 
honestly!"</Br>
<Br>"Hmmmm... that sounds a bit strange, but you wanna know something?"</Br>
<Br>Jeremy shook is head silently in reply.</Br>
<Br>"I believe you because just the other night, during the full moon, I felt what you 
described. When I got up, I felt the sensation leave, but then I went back to it as if I were 
drawn to it. I too fell asleep, but I woke up in a stranger 
place yet. When I woke, after sleeping for what I too thought was a second, I was in a cave 
surrounded by wolves. When I looked down at myself, I was a wolf too. Startled by the 
entire experience, I got up on my paws and started to 
leave. As soon as the movement was detected, the Alpha wolf jumped in my way and 
inquired where I was going. It was strange, but I could understand and even speak to him 
like we are speaking now. I know it wasn't english, but 
wolf sounds, yet I could communicate."</Br>
<Br>"Interesting, but I have to ask... what does it have to do with us?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... my boy, I would have to assume everything. You see, while you think you are 
awake, you are still asleep in the aged home that was mine. I think that this is a dream for 
you to communicate with me, or I with you, so you 
can be prepared for what lies ahead."</Br>
<Br>"<em>What lies ahead...</em> What do you mean by this?"</Br>
<Br>"Well, when I woke up I was different from how I had always been. You see, before 
sleeping in that bed, I was as scrawny as a toothpick and I was smooth all over. I was 26, 
but I looked like I was 18. When I woke; I was furry in 
all the normal places, I had stubble on my face and I looked like I was in my mid-thirties. 
I would assume that you will experience a change in appearance right off the bat when 
you actually wake up."</Br>
<Br>"So... the bed changed you and you gained some enhancements?"</Br>
<Br>"Heh, yeah you could say that, but there was more... a whole lot more to it. During 
that first day when I awoke, I went about my business as usual and when I went to eat 
throughout the day, I couldn't get in the mood to eat. 
My brain knew it was time, but my eyes and stomach told it otherwise. So I just continued 
to work, not even breaking a sweat due to my improved physique. Then, that night when I 
went to relax... that was when things changed... I 
changed."</Br>
<Br>"You changed?" Jeremy rose a furled eyebrow at the restating of things. "What do you 
mean?"</Br>
<Br>"Just what I said young man, I changed into something different... something more. 
Just the thought of becoming that thing again has my blood boiling and I can feel my body 
on the edge of what is to come for you. I, like you 
are now that you fell asleep in my bed under the light of the full moon, am a 
werewolf."</Br>
<Br>Now Jeremy knew that he might have been in a dream and if he wasn't, all of this was 
definitely strange and confusing... all at the same time.</Br>
<Br>"Sure... you are a werewolf and I am George Washington's far past relative. Even if 
this is a dream, you are nuts!"</Br>
<Br>"Ok then, I will show you that I am not."</Br>
<Br>With the feeling in his veins growing to the strongest it had ever been before he 
changed in the past, the man reveled in the feeling. It was strong and extremely powerful 
this time. The man allowed the flood gates to open and 
he changed right in front of Jeremy. His body bulked with muscle, his exposed skin 
blossomed with fur, his face pushed out into a muzzle while his nose flattened and 
widened from the reconfiguration of his face, his teeth 
lengthened and developed into fangs, his hands and feet shifted into paws while his hind 
feet burst through the work boots he had been wearing. When it was all said and done, his 
tail popped out from his waist band of the now 
straining and somewhat tattered jean shorts. Jeremy was amazed and stared at the tufts of 
his fur poking through the ripped portion of the fabric.</Br>
<Br>In a deeper, more animal sounding voice, the creature spoke to him. "Now do you 
believe me boy?"</Br>
<Br>"Yup, I do about a couple of things. One, you really are a werewolf and two, this must 
be a dream because such things do not exist in the real world."</Br>
<Br>"You are right, you are in a dream because I have been dead for a hundred years. The 
second thing is, there aren't any other creatures of stories out there, not even our kind. 
Now that you have taken on the gift, others would 
call it a curse, you can do what I started."</Br>
<Br>"I thought werewolves, our kind, were immortal."</Br>
<Br>"Indeed we are, but I was shot in the head at point blank range with a silver bullet 
while in my human form. I wanted a normal life with being a werewolf, so before I even 
gifted someone else, I found a companion and I 
foolishly shared with her my secret. She acted normal, as though I could trust her. That 
night, however, she loaded a gun and pulled it on me while we were going to sleep 
together. She gave me a kiss on the cheek, put the gun to 
my head, and then that was all she wrote. If I had not been so naive, I would have been 
able to do what you now must."</Br>
<Br>"Ok... is there anything else that I should know?"</Br>
<Br>"There are a couple things, yes. The first is that you are always in control of 
changing, unless you are angered to the point where you feel yourself lose control. The 
second is that while the full moon will not change you, it will 
make everything about you stronger and more virulent. What I mean by that is your 
muscles will be more defined, you will feel stronger and faster, you will even feel more in 
the mood to do the deed, and the last thing is that your 
inhibitions will be greatly diminished and you will act more freely. This is both for your 
human and werewolf forms. While being a werewolf, it will be even stronger since the wolf 
is under the influence, just as much as humans, of 
the waxing and waning of the moon."</Br>
<Br>The man that was a werewolf put his right paw to Jeremy's face and patted it lightly. 
At that second, you woke back up in the room you knew earlier. Everything was dusty and 
covered with cobwebs. Looking around, not seeing 
who woke you, you realized that Mike had tapped you on the face. Realizing that what you 
just went through was indeed a dream, you notice that the sun had been up for a 
bit.</Br>
<Br>"What the hell dude... you come in here, get under the covers of some person's 
strange bed and you fall asleep?"</Br>
<Br>Not really feeling ashamed in the least, Jeremy just chuckled.</Br>
<Br>"Dude! That is so not funny... I looked all over for you, I even came in here before I 
left and you were no where to be found. Now, when I came back, here you are fast asleep 
when everyone else was worried about you since 
you didn't come home last night."</Br>
<Br>Jeremy knew that Mike was sore at him, but there wasn't much he could do... he did 
fall asleep there and he was guilty of everything stated against him. Not knowing what to 
do or say, Jeremy moved his arm so he could scratch 
his head, but then realized something. His body felt different to him, as though several 
pounds of weight had been slipped on him overnight.</Br>
<Br>"Are you going to get out of that bed or do I have to drag you out myself?" Mike 
asked with a full helping of anger.</Br>
<Br>"No, no... I'll get out myself."</Br>
<Br>As Jeremy got out of the bed, both Mike and Jeremy were shocked. Before that night, 
Jeremy just had a slender runner's physique; now he had a body of a man who spent a 
good deal of his time lifting weights, buffing up. 
What Mike didn't notice before, since Jeremy had been facing the other direction on his 
side, he looked older... mid-thirties older.</Br>
<Br>The only thing that either of them could say was <em>Dude</em>!</Br></p>
