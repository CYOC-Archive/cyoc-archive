<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Duke&#39;s meeting with S.P.E.A.R, his friends, Nat, and Wyatt had shown the dhamphir that in order to win, they would need help. After consulting Merlin, as well as the vampires, he gained an understanding of the Mad Queen Vanessa. This ancient vampire was far more powerful than any understood, meaning they needed any advantage they could get. &quot;Where are we,&quot; Wyatt asked as he, Sasha, and Duke exited a portal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whitby,&quot; Duke replied, gazing around the small town on the coast of England. &quot;And why are we here brother,&quot; Wyatt replied acidly. &quot;Because Vanessa is far stronger than either of us can manage,&quot; Duke said. &quot;If we are to stop her and save your family, we need any advantage we can get. According to Merlin, there is information here we can use to defeat her.&quot; Sasha now turned, glaring at her boyfriends brother as she stomped forward. &quot;Now quit being a dick Wyatt and follow us.&quot; Wyatt grumbled, trailing behind the pair as they made their way through the town.<br />
<br />
While S.P.E.A.R and Nat were in the vampire realm, Wyatt worried about his family. He had little faith in his brothers adoptive kid sister nor this government organization. Despite their assurances of a covert operation, he had his doubts. That and he didn&#39;t like delaying in rushing to his families rescue. Kyra and his children were in danger, as a father, a husband, and ruler he couldn&#39;t sit idly by. He was Wyatt Tepes, the heir of Dracula. If he could not protect his progeny or his people then what good was he? &quot;This is preposterous,&quot; he exclaimed as they made their way through the darkened streets. &quot;We should be with the others trying to rescue my family!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;But rushing in is a fools errand. We need any advantage if we are to defeat Vanessa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry little Wyatt,&quot; Sasha smirked. &quot;You&#39;ll be sitting on your throne soon enough being pampered.&quot; Wyatt stopped dead in his tracks, baring his fangs as he glared at Sasha with murderous intent. &quot;Is that what you think,&quot; he growled. &quot;That I worry about MY CROWN! Newsflash my wife and my children are in danger. They are the priority, everything else is secondary.&quot; Sasha paused, raising an eyebrow as she studied Wyatt carefully. &quot;But what would you know,&quot; Wyatt spat. &quot;All you and my brother do is waste your lives, selfishly ignoring anyone but yourselves!&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke spun, angrily glaring at his brother as he bared his fangs. &quot;Selfish,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;All Sasha and I do is help people. I&#39;m training to be a medic, Sasha helps people with magic. Just because because I care little about vampires, vampires that tortured me for years, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t care about other people, so watch what you say to Sasha or I&#39;ll tear your heart out and feed it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t helping,&quot; Sasha exclaimed stepping between the brothers. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t like you Wyatt. I probably never will but we&#39;re willing to help you save your family. I may not get why Duke actually cares but he talked me into helping you.&quot; Wyatt balked, gazing at his brother in shock. &quot;You talked the wizards into helping! Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen how cruel vampires can be to children,&quot; Duke scowled, her voice low. &quot;No matter how much I despise you brother, no child should have to go through what I did.&quot; Wyatt was speechless,  the last thing he expected was for Duke to care about his children. Offering a soft thank you, the group continued on their way.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Duke explained why they were in this small English town. According to Merlin, their was a man who had knowledge of Vanessa. While the man was a bit of a hermit, the ancient wizard explained that if asked he could offer them assistance. All Merlin said was that if they went, it should be both Wyatt and Duke. As they now approached a small house on the edge of town, Sasha shuddered. &quot;I think that&#39;s it,&quot; she said pointing to the small cabin. &quot;Geez it looks creepy...and old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So who is this mystery man,&quot; Wyatt asked. Duke shrugged, he wasn&#39;t entirely sure. All Merlin told him was that he resided in a small cabin on the outskirts of town and had information on the Mad Queen. Tentatively, the trio approached, knocking softly on the door. As they listened to movement inside, they wondered who this man could be.<br />
<br />
As the door opened, Sasha, Duke, and Wyatt gaped at the large figure. The man stood around 7 feet tall. Impressively muscled with shoulder length dark hair, dark eyes and a goatee he raised an eyebrow as he stared at the three young people before him. &quot;Who are you,&quot; he asked, his voice a deep. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin sent us,&quot; Sasha said quickly. &quot;My names Sasha. This is my boyfriend Duke and his brother Wyatt.&quot; The man nodded, carefully studying the brothers. &quot;You two are vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dhamphir actually,&quot; Duke replied. &quot;My name is Duke Thomassan.&quot; The man nodded, leaning in. Duke felt as if the man&#39;s dark eyes were peering into his very soul. &quot;What is your real name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tepes,&quot; Duke stammered. &quot;Duke Tepes. My father is Miro Tepes.&quot; The man nodded, turning to Wyatt, who now stood tall as a confident smile spread across his face. &quot;And I am Wyatt Tepes,&quot; he said proudly. &quot;Adopted blood son of Miro Tepes and lord of the vampires.&quot; The man nodded, looking between the two before stepping out of his home. &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trailing behind the man, both Duke and Wyatt glanced at one another. Whoever this guy was he knew about vampires yet he himself was a completely mystery. Watching the man carefully, theyvsaw him now approach an ancient tombstone. Reaching inside his jacket, thw brothers watched as he laid a single white rose upon the headstone before resting his hand upon it. &quot;I come here every night,&quot; he said softly. &quot;To lay a rose upon my beloved wife&#39;s grave, as remembrance for the one true love I&#39;ve had in my centuries of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha, Duke, and Wyatt raised an eyebrow. Centuries? Hoe old was this man? As Sasha glanced at the tombstone, she gasped as she saw the date. &quot;1512! This grave is over 500 years old!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke and Wyatt now approached, glancing at the name upon the ancient headstone before gasping. &quot;Lisa Tepes?! But that would mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the man replied, rising to his full height. &quot;I am Vlad Dracula Tepes.&quot;</p>
