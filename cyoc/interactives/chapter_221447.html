<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Swimming was always a way to cool down in the heat, and that was something that played out heavily in the IAC. Some could argue that the competition for these races would &quot;raise&quot; temperatures in them, but it didn&#39;t change the coolness of the pool&#39;s water. And that was something that Kumiko really liked. Like the other Cetacean based Animalians, she wasn&#39;t covered in fur, but she had gained a fair amount of muscle mass she had found from scans made after her mate, Ningen, made her the White Orca Animalian she now was, that there was a thin layer of blubber that served as some form of insolation. It wasn&#39;t enough to make her fat, and in fact, aside from her very generous breasts and curvy hips and butt, most would actually say that Kumiko was rather thin and less muscular than her Mosasaur Dinotopian cousin, Kumiyo. It would surprise people to find that under that layer of blubber was a strong layer of muscle.<br />
<br />
The scans that found that thin layer of blubber and served to give the Kumiko the same sort of insolation that all Cetaceans had and that could keep her rather warm, and particularly so in the rather warm weather that was going on in many places as part of the summer. It made getting into the cool water at the Claw Coliseum&#39;s pool rather relaxing. It was almost enough to get Kumiko to forget that she was there to race as part of the various swimming events of the IAC, but these races were also things she was looking forward to and had trained hard for. She wasn&#39;t necessarily super competitive, but she&#39;d found that after becoming an Animalian and having the muscle power to move without need of special assistance for her breasts, she had a lot of energy to burn and when the sign-up for the IAC events appeared at Heiya Island, she and Ningen were quick to sign up. Kumiyo was willing to come along with them to Lyre to watch the races and largely with the idea that they would then continue to Dinotopia Aquatica so that she could see Ty again.<br />
<br />
The races though were arranged to provide some relatively fair competition and came in connection with the comparison event regarding how Humans would compare with Animalians at swimming. For while the pool was big and could easily set up distances for fast-paced races and longer endurance races, there were some races that would be unfair races. There were some land based Animalians that had entered races and Kumiko knew that water based Animalians like her and Ningen would have an obvious advantage, which had been part of what had shown out in the race between the aquatic Animalians and the Humans. Kumiko sat with her mate and her cousin and watched as the land based Animalians had their races and found good company and intrigue in meeting with another Dinotopian, who would be among those racing with the aquatic Animalians, Miki, a Mixosaurus Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;They all swam quite well,&quot; Ningen commented with some amazement in his voice as one of the land Animalian races ended. It was won by a Dog Animalian, but a Horse Animalian actually faired fairly well in the race, and it was that Horse Animalian that Ningen was most impressed by. &quot;I mean, all animals can swim, but that Horse Animalian did quite well and even beat a few of those that would feet better suited for swimming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a lot of training was involved,&quot; Kumiyo commented, &quot;though Kumiko and Miki will be having their races next. Then you, Ningen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder who we&#39;ll be racing against?&quot; Kumiko spoke as she looked over to the Dinotopian that had sat with them at the stands for the Human/Animalian comparison and had joined them to watch many of the other races in these events.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would imagine that they would be among them,&quot; Miki commented as she pointed to an Orca and Great White Shark Animalian that were getting up from their seats in an area near the stands. Both were dressed in the one-piece swimsuits that Kumiko and Miki were wearing. To a degree, Kumiko would have preferred a bikini, which she knew would fit her chest better than a one-piece swimsuit, but because the IAC had organized its aquatic events to follow a similar model to the Olympics, which then meant that things were designed more to preserve the competition and not trying to attract other attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck, cousin!&quot; Kumiyo called to Kumiko, &quot;Ningen and I will root for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko nodded and slowly approached the other two Animalians that were there and in the one-piece swimsuits for the race. The one that was a fellow Orca Animalian noticed Kumiko seemed quite eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; the Orca Animalian said with a smile, &quot;you&#39;re the one that got beached on Heiya Island! The White Whale!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arlene, aren&#39;t White Whales their own species?&quot; the Great White Animalian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are... but Orcas are normally to be like me, black and white,&quot; the Orca Animalian, Arlene, answered, &quot;not a faded grayish-white and white.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s believed to be a rare case of leucism,&quot; Kumiko answered, &quot;and actually, the Orca who beached himself is my mate, Ningen. He merely made me the Orca woman I am today... and I&#39;m happy for it. Though, around Hokkaido where my father and uncle run their fishing operations, these white Orcas are a bit more common than in other parts of the Orca&#39;s range.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s certainly amazing,&quot; Arlene said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m Arlene, and this is my wife Moxie. And seated here are Jason and his husband Herman. They&#39;ll be in the male&#39;s race after ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko looked down to see a male Great White and Orca Animalian seated together and bouncing a young Orca and Great White Animalian on their knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re gay, just as Arlene and I are,&quot; Moxie commented, &quot;but converting has awakened other... drives in both of us. So, we all live together and we get the best of everything. The partners we love, opposites of the appropriate species to abide by Animalia&#39;s edicts... and a resulting family that makes everything fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Kumiko spook and gave a small smile, &quot;I&#39;m Kumiko...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t your sister in the races?&quot; Arlene wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kumiyo is my cousin, actually,&quot; Kumiko answered, &quot;my father and uncle were identical twins and they both married identical twins... which is why Kumiyo and I have been confused as sisters, and why she became a Tylosaurus Dinotopian, so that we&#39;d stand apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t she in the races too?&quot; Moxie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my cousin helped me train... but she wasn&#39;t interested in being in the races,&quot; Kumiko answered, &quot;she&#39;s here to cheer me on... but a lot of it is also to then go onto Florida after the aquatic events at the IAC are over and she can visit with the Dinotopian that made her the Mosasaur she is. Then the plan is to hope that romance blooms...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was hoping you&#39;d karate chop that state&#39;s governor,&quot; Herman commented from his seat, turning all eyes to him. He then said defensively, &quot;they guy is actively spreading lies about homosexuals and all sorts of other stuff... and at best, regarding Animalia, that it&#39;s a cure for homosexuality. So, I&#39;m not going to say he&#39;s a nice guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those of us on Dinotopia Aquatica don&#39;t like him, either,&quot; Miki gave a sigh, &quot;but for now... let&#39;s just focus on what we can effect... these races.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Kumiko, Arlene, and Moxie all said, nearly in unison.<br />
<br />
There followed a few more small introductions as Kumiko met some of the other aquatic Animalians that were in the race she was in, and they were friendly, but as they readied for the next race there were the assorted rules and other things to follow. This included being in the right lane and staying in that lane. But that did involve slipping into the water, which Kumiko looked forward to. It would feel cool on a hot day, but since this was a race, it wasn&#39;t like she could just break the rules. And so, Kumiko moved to her assigned platform above her lane to swim through. She glanced to see Arlene to her right and Moxie to her left. Miki was on the other side of Arlene. Kumiko gave a polite nod to them and then got into the assigned position and waited for the starter&#39;s horn. When it sounded, she dove forward, and she could hear her cousin and mate cheering for her.</p>
