<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily hurriedly drove over to the daycare center, receiving an annoyed look from the woman working there as she dropped Erin off. “Sorry!” Emily sheepishly called. Glancing down at her phone, she realized she still had a few chores left before she could do back to relaxing, especially since she’d overslept. She decided that since she was out, she should do one of the errands that required her to be outside... grocery shopping!<br />
<br />
Emily happily drove around town, enjoying the nice day and was just overall happy to NOT be in school. &quot;I wonder how Mom&#39;s doing.&quot; She wondered. At an infamously long red light, she quickly texted her &#39;U good?&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHY DIF U GIBE ME A BOYFRIEMD IM MARRIED.&quot; The text came in, and Emily burst out laughing. She made a number of fun changes for Rebecca to discover, and a hot bf was one of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun &#128514; &quot; was all she texted back as the light turned green and she continued on her merry way.<br />
<br />
She rolled up to the local stop and shop, hopped out, grabbed a cart, and began to casually stroll into the store. It was a large place with several aisles and a lot of people shopping around. &quot;Ugh, don&#39;t you people have jobs?&quot; She thought while beginning to walk around.<br />
<br />
For a few minutes she was just picking up products, but she very quickly grew bored. A smirk grew across her face, and she began to look around for potential &#39;volunteers&#39; as she liked to call them.<br />
<br />
There was an old lady shopping with what looked like her grandson. The woman was probably in her late 60s, with brown hair turning grey, some wrinkles, and a chest that was long since past its prime as it was sagging slightly. She was dressed in jeans and a blouse. The blonde boy next to her was probably no older than 8, and was currently bouncing around trying to reach some candy, jumping in his bright sneakers and spider-man t-shirt and shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nana I want it I want it!&quot; He called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nathan it looks delicious but you can&#39;t have more sugar today.&quot; She sighed, going back to pushing her cart.<br />
<br />
Emily smiled, then activated her powers with the specific goal to fuse them. A bright FLASH engulfed the aisle and as it cleared where there were once two people there was now one.<br />
<br />
She was probably around 30 something. She had a stylized tank top with a spider-man logo on it, tight jeans and nice sneakers. She had long dirty-blonde hair, and a decent figure all things considered. She stopped walking away, and turned back towards Emily. For a moment her heart skipped a beat, worried that she had left awareness on, but was relieved when she walked past her towards the candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh what the hell Natalie, treat yourself girl!&quot; Emily heard her mutter to herself before she tossed the candy in the cart and kept walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah girl have fun.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Natalie something... gotta remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since her mother did teach her some responsibility, she always made sure she could change her volunteers back eventually. Usually it was easy, as she had a &#39;reset&#39; mode, where when she activates her powers, anyone in her gaze that had been changed can revert right back to how they were. Though if it was hard to find them then it could occasionally be a problem.<br />
<br />
Emily kept walking, eventually making it into the frozen foods aisle. It was mostly empty, but the two closest people were what seemed to be a boyfriend and girlfriend shopping together. The guy was just your typical skater dude bro with long shaggy hair and a beard with loose closing. His head was sticking into the freezer as he looked through the pizza.<br />
<br />
Beside him was his girlfriend, although she looked pissed. Her blonde hair was tied in a ponytail, and she only wore a tank top and short shorts, but the rest of her screamed &#39;I&#39;m freezing&#39;. She looked like she had goose bumps, her arms were crossed, and she was clentching her teeth as she tapped her foot away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry UP Jake I&#39;m fucking freezing my ass off.&quot; She angrily whispered, and Emily could barely overhear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Amy.&quot; He nonchalantly exclaimed from inside the freezer. &quot;I like, just gotta find the best brand!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily smirked, deciding to help the girl out. She didn&#39;t know how though, so she decided to try another specific changing option. She pointed towards the girl, but also made sure that the freezers and the ice container behind her were in view, and she focused on blending her in with her surroundings. As the FLASH went off, and the light dissipated, Emily was very surprised.<br />
<br />
She figured the girl would just now be wearing, like, snow gear, but that was NOT the case. She still wore the tank top and shorts, but everything about her was totally different. Her skin had gone from a pale white to a light tan. Her wavy blonde hair was now jet black, straight, and now cascading past her shoulders. Her eyes seemed to be different too as the change finally clicked in Emily&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit wait I learned about this in school!&quot; Emily thought. &quot;She&#39;s Native American... uhhhh, Inuit! Yeah Inuit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, finally found it!&quot; Jake laughed as he pulled his head from the freezer. &quot;Sorry for the wait Amka.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No problems here babe. I&#39;ve been in the cold before you know. This is nothing compared to my grandparent&#39;s place in Nunavut.&quot; She said with a laugh before grabbing Jakes free hand and walking out of the aisle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I get it... it made her someone used to cold.&quot; Emily mumbled with a smile. &quot;Well glad it didn&#39;t make her like a snowman or something... dang I shouldn’t use that one much blend in is always so unpredictable and not as fun as full random.&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of random, she thought at least one of those could be funny. So as she browsed the aisles for her required items, she kept an eye out for any fun groups to try it on. Eventually, she bumped into the perfect target; a group of 4 college boys. She knew they were in college from the local University name on two of the four&#39;s clothing.<br />
<br />
There was a an Asian guy, an African American guy, and a white guy and girl. The asian guy had slightly longer hair, wore glasses, and had on a Star Wars t-shirt with jeans. He was decently fit but nothing to ride home about. The brunette white guy was wearing the Universities football jersey and shorts. The blonde girl was wearing a jacket over her cheerleader&#39;s onesie, and was pretty attractive though she didn&#39;t have the best butt... which Emily felt bad immediately for judging but whatever her thoughts, her opinions. Then there was the cutest one, at least in her view. The black guy was tall, decently muscular, and was wearing a polo with shorts. He had sunglasses on, which was odd to Emily, but also made her curious as she walked closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;...nd that&#39;s why we gotta grab recesses puffs!&quot; The Asian guy finished explaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry that&#39;s nothing but sugar.&quot; The girl sighed. &quot;You&#39;d be better off just swallowing a bunch of sugar before class instead of eating that junk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God Miranda don&#39;t be so uptight!&quot; Henry scoffed. &quot;Sugar doesn&#39;t have chocolate or peanut butter mixed in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you two keep it down.&quot; The white guy retorted. &quot;Andre and I are still hungover as balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously.&quot; Andre replied, adjusting his shades. &quot;I&#39;m worse off than you though Brian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not my fault you thought that keg shit was a good idea.&quot; Brian retorted, pinching his forehead in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well serves you two right for drinking on a school night. Right Miranda?&quot; Henry laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t drag me into this dork I&#39;m still mad at them both.&quot; She scoffed, turning away from all of them. She looked up, briefly saw Emily, blushed and then turned back around, seemingly angrily whispering something to the three others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I probably embarrassed her with me being so close.&quot; Emily thought. &quot;Don&#39;t worry girl, I can temporarily give all of you a new situation to deal with, and odds are it&#39;ll be better than this.&quot; She thought before a quick finger snap as the bright FLASH engulfed them all.<br />
<br />
The random change, when worked on groups, usually kept them together, and this time was no different. She gazed upon them and had to stifle a chuckle at the VERY changed group.<br />
<br />
Where Miranda had been was now a man. He had blonde hair still, but it was cut very short and combed over. While the girl was probably 21, this guy seemed older, maybe 30 at most. He also had a scruffy beard, and wore a flannel that was largely green, the same as the jacket, and blue shorts, which was the same color as the cheerleader&#39;s former dress.<br />
<br />
Beside him was an African American woman, presumably Andre. While before his hair was almost fully shaved, this new woman had a lot of curly hair, largely kept up in a big, fluffy perm-like ponytail above her head. She had huge tits, a fat ass, was wearing a large red dress, and most shockingly of all, she had a very large stomach and was obviously pregnant.<br />
<br />
Finally, there was a little girl, no older than 6. She looked like a good mix of her two parents, with tan skin somewhere between the both of them in tone. She had curly hair, though not as much as her mother&#39;s, and wore an adorable frozen dress on and wore glasses, causing Emily to guess that this was Henry, leaving Brian to be the only one left to be the unborn fetus in the very pregnant newly transformed mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy pleeeeease can we get recies peecies?&quot; The little girl begged, holding up the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said Henrietta, no they have too much sugar.&quot; He sighed before placing the box back. &quot;And it&#39;s reeses puffs sweetie. Reeses pieces is the candy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooommy?&quot; Henrietta whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to your father sweetie.&quot; The new mother responded, before adjusting the sunglasses Emily just realized were still on her face. She looked off for a moment, and then the new father looked down towards the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sweetie, why don&#39;t you look for a different cereal to grab?&quot; He suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; She replied with a sigh before walking down the aisle slightly.<br />
<br />
Once she was out of ear shot, the new father turned to his wife.<br />
&quot;You okay Andrea? Morning sickness again?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m fine Marvin baby, just some vertigo.&quot; Andrea replied with a sigh. &quot;It&#39;ll be all worth it once this baby enters the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin smiled, and was about to say something else when he spotted Emily, who only just realized she had been slowly walking forward unconsciously. &quot;Oh, hello there.&quot; He greeted.<br />
<br />
Emily was stunned for a second, realizing she was too invested in the recent change to notice, but she quickly rebounded.<br />
&quot;Hello there! I&#39;m, um, actually a mother myself!&quot; She greeted, technically telling the truth, at least for this altered reality. &quot;Your daughter is adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you.&quot; Andrea beamed. &quot;She&#39;s gonna be getting a new sister soon.&quot; She replied, rubbing her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s amazing.&quot; Emily smiled. &quot;Any name ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wanted Barbara.&quot; Marvin added. &quot;But Andrea is dead-set on Brianna.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think both are excellent.&quot; Emily laughed before pointing down the aisle. &quot;Though, you may want to focus on your currently born daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two followed Emily&#39;s gesture to see Henrietta holding at least 3 jumbo boxes of cereal, trying to not drop it and failing.<br />
&quot;Henrietta!&quot; They both yelled as Marvin ran over while Andrea waddled behind.<br />
<br />
Emily chuckled and walked away. As she grabbed the last item on her list, she rounded the corner to see a long line at the only open counter. There were a few new faces, like an old 50 something year old grouch of a man, two tween boys, and a small, clearly overwhelmed female clerk. There were also all familiar faces, like Natalie, who had a lot more candy in her cart, Jake with his newly Inuit girlfriend Amka, and the family of three, soon to be 4, all of which were waiting on this long line. <br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s mind began to race. It was all so fun, but should she change them back now? She would have to eventually, but that was kinda boring. On one hand, it&#39;d b easier to just do it now rather than tracking them all down later... but on the other hand, it was way more fun to see how people adjust to these new lives after, say, a few weeks rather than half an hour at most. Of course... she could always create more chaos? Maybe mix some groups up? Or she could just focus on these new volunteers? She was sure the old man could use the youth, the tweens could use some lesson, and the worker could use some help.<br />
<br />
Her mind raced, until finally...</p>
