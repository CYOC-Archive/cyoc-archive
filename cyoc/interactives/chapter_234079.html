<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spark and Connor turned between each other and Queen Glitter, fear slowly creeping over them. They were trapped and if they failed to figure out how, all would be lost. Once more a rumbling shook the foundations, bringing them back to their senses as voices called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your majesty our shields are weakening quicker than anticipated!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The army reports casualties at ten percent!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your orders?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glitter shook herself from shock, a fierce expression on her face as she turned to her council. &quot;Star assemble the images to strengthen our shields,&quot; she said. &quot;Deploy the reserve garrisons to reinforce our army. Inform all defensive batteries to fire at will.&quot; Star and the council nodded, speeding off as fast as their wings could carry them.<br />
<br />
Now alone, Glitter turned to Spark and Connor. &quot;I need you two to find the source of this problem,&quot; she stated. &quot;The Normal obviously are impeding travel between the realms. Find out how and disable it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we supposed to find it,&quot; Connor asked. Glitter now reached into her dress, removing a small, white crystal.<br />
<br />
&quot;This crystal is tuned to the frequency that allows portal travel between the realms,&quot; she said. &quot;Normally it would glow when a portal is open. I believe it will help lead you to whatever is blocking travel. It should grow brighter, the closer you get to the interference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark now reached out, taking the crystal in her hand as another shock wave shook the castle to its very foundations. Glancing outside, the green fairy gasped as a wave of fire passed over the spires, embers slowly drifting downwards towards the castle made Sparks eyes dampen. Those weren&#39;t just embers, they were fairy remains. &quot;Hurry,&quot; she said urgently. &quot;We don&#39;t have much time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor and Spark nodded to Glitter as they both left her and Glitter took a deep breath. &quot;Jacob, I hope you&#39;re watching over them from beyond. Jon,&quot; A lone tear went down Glitter&#39;s face before she wiped it away. &quot;give our daughter strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor and Spark now made their way out of the capital, careful to avoid danger along the way. It helped that they both had training for situations like this, Spark had military training while Connor was trained by both his brother and his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;She looked really worried.&quot; Connor said as they found some cover on the streets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she is. Our home hasn&#39;t seen a fight like this since the war with the Unseelie.&quot; Spark said taking a deep breath and closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sometimes forget you were there.&quot; Connor remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know and now, it&#39;s going to be you and me soon. Another Mr. and Mrs. Moreland, I just....hope one of us doesn&#39;t end up becoming a widow or widower.&quot; Spark said as Connor suddenly took her hand.<br />
<br />
The two of them then made their way through the streets as the crystal began to glow a little brighter. Spark flew her and Connor through the street until they had to find cover again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a scary thought, because it&#39;s a scary world. We&#39;ve both seen the worst of it, and we&#39;ll keep seeing the worst of it. But the point is that we get through it together. Me, you, and maybe....one day....our kids.&quot; Connor said with a little blush. Spark also blushed at this thought. They held the crystal out again as they saw it begin to glow brighter, but saw the direction they had to go was a little hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need some motivation.&quot; Spark said to Connor who looked at him a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what? What motivation could I give you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....our...our future. Tell me what you want for our future.&quot; Spark said with enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...we&#39;ll have....kids, how about that? Would you like kids?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know it. Three at least.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three?! Wow, all boys, all girls? A little of both?&quot; Connor suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take whatever you give me. We&#39;ll train, raise them, train them, they&#39;re going to be tough fighters. What else you got?&quot; Spark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;ll take you on a honeymoon trip to wherever you want.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may sound dumb, but I&#39;ve kind of wanted to go to Montana. I&#39;ve seen what it looks like in pictures, the lakes, the mountains, the cabins, it looks so beautiful. You promise we&#39;ll go there?&quot; Spark asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah, Montana, New York, the Rockies, I don&#39;t care where it is, so long as I&#39;m with you.&quot; Connor said with enthusiasm. &quot;Also....&quot; Connor then bit his lip and whispered into Spark&#39;s ear as Spark&#39;s face grew bright red as as smile appeared on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCKING HELL YEAH, NOW THAT&#39;S MOTIVATION!&quot; Spark said as she gave Connor a passionate kiss on the lips before they flew to the source of the interference. Weaving their way through the streets, both teens could see the mass panic enveloping the city. The cities cannons and catapults fired continuously, archers in towers letting loose with arrow after arrow. On the ground, those not fighting were scrambling towards shelter, carrying small children as they looked for someplace to hide. Spark now noticed a group of mages collectively casting spells to try and strengthen the magical barrier that protected the capital. Despite their efforts, Spark could tell that the barrier was weakening.<br />
<br />
As the pair reached the edge of town, an eerie silence overtook the area. All of the fairies had abandoned this place, looking for safer shelter. As the pair paused, Connor held up the crystal, watching it glow brightly. &quot;Whatever is jamming the portals is located in the forest.&quot; he said, pointing at the thick woods. &quot;Do you think it&#39;s far?&quot; Spark asked. Connor shook his head, he didn&#39;t think so but a new problem now arose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark,&quot; Connor said slowly. &quot;Chances are wherever this thing is it&#39;s being guarded by people. Regular sized people. How are we going to stop them like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have something for that,&quot; Spark stated, removing a small bag from around her waist. &quot;The fairy realm usually shrinks people down to fairy size pretty quickly. Whatever these guys are using is protecting them and I have no idea how to destroy it. That&#39;s why we use this. This fairy dust will grow us to human size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For how long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty minute maybe,&quot; Spark replied. Connor nodded, understanding the importance of what Spark was saying. Once they used the dust they would have twenty minutes to fix the problem before they began to slowly shrink once more. Taking Spark&#39;s hand, he now tried to give her a reassuring smile. &quot;Then we better be quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark nodded, placing a passionate kiss on Connors lips as she let the dust go. Connor sneezed, the dust covering him before a sense of vertigo overtook him. Glancing around he noticed from his perspective that the town now appeared to be shrinking, the pair quickly stepping outside into the surrounding woods before ducking down. As the pair reached their full human height, Connor now activated his enchanted hydra mail. In seconds the teen found himself covered from head to toe in the enchanted armor Arion had given him. With a gesture, the pair now made their way into the woods, the fate of the fairy realm on their shoulders.</p>
