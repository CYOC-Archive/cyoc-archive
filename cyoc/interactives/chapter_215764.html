<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being horrified would be an understatement, Jeff felt a mixture of betrayal, anger and shock, this causes Jeff to be at a loss for words. ‘I can’t believe,’ the teen thinks to himself, ‘that my best friend, who I know since Kindergarten, would be so… so… evil!’<br />
<br />
“Before I forget, Jeff,” Ken then suddenly says, Jeff looks at his “friend”, “you won’t be able to communicate, houses don’t talk, but you will keep your mind, which means, you’ll be aware of anything that goes on”.<br />
<br />
“Would I at least keep my vision,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “yes, your House-form will have a high end security system, that includes cameras, which are going to be located in each room of the “House” and the outside of the House”.<br />
<br />
“So… I’ll have thousands of “eyes”,” Jeff asks, “man… imagining seeing hundreds of stuff at the same time already makes me feel dizzy”.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “you’ll get used to it,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff grumbles, “anything else I should know?”<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “the interior of the “House”, from the furniture, kitchen, toilettes, showers, beds, pools, carpets, stairs, TVs, Entertainment, Wallpaper… all of it will be created out of your body: skin, bones, organs, blood, nerves…,” Ken smirks, “in other words: you will feel everything”.<br />
<br />
“Meaning?”<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “when I walk across the carpets, tiles, wooden floors or stroke the Walls: it will feel as if an ant is walking across your skin. When someone flushes the toilette, it’ll feel as if you are peeing, but since the “water” will never subside and always return, your “blader” will always feel as if it’s about to burst”.<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, “what the fuck is wrong with you, Ken,” he asks, “I don’t recognize you! How can you be so cruel?”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “I am simply dominant,” he says, “I enjoy the feeling of having power over someone and that he or she is unable to do anything about it”. Ken then notices something and his grin widens, “looks like the transformation is finally starting”.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Ken points, “look down,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down, his eyes widen and his mouth hangs open, “MY FEET,” he shouts, “THEY ARE SINKING INTO THE GROUND!”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “hehe… looks like the “Basement” will be the first part of the “House” to be “built”,” he says, “this might be painful, as your toes and some of your bones become the sewer pipes, especially when the “pipes” connect to the sewer”.<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified, “wh-why,” he asks, as his legs start to sink into ground, “wh-why do you want me to suffer?”<br />
<br />
Ken shrugs, “I guess I just enjoy seeing others in pain,” he says, grinning evilly.<br />
<br />
“H-how… how is it possible,” Jeff asks, “that I never noticed your evil side?”<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “easy,” he says, “I am a great actor, like any psychopath. I actually should be locked away in a Luny-bin! Hehe… but that will never happen, because I am to smart, and now… I have the power over a Chronivac”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s fear grows, “no…,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… looks like you got the drift,” he says, smirking, “yes… if I should enjoy my freedom… you just might stay a House for a little longer than a week. Maybe a Month? A Year? Hehe… I guess until I get bored and decide to try something new!”<br />
<br />
“But… I am a human,” Jeff says, his legs have sunken to the knees, and he feels himself still sinking deeper, “y-you can’t do this to me!”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “hehe… no, Jeff… you WERE a human… now you are just an OBJECT, and I can do what ever I want! You are MY property… I OWN YOU!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified, Ken really seems to be a sick person, the worst part is, that he now has the Chronivac! He can do what ever he wants and Jeff will have no way to stop him, “Ken… please,” he begs, “please… don’t… don’t do this!”<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “sorry, Jeff,” he says, “but YOU are in no position to tell me what I can and can’t do. I’ll have so much fun, now that I have the Chronivac, I already have so many ideas!”<br />
<br />
By now, Jeff’s body has stopped sinking into the ground, his feet, legs and hips are in the ground, he can feel the cold and damp earth on his cock and in his bum crack, his butt itching as crumbs of earth enter his body. Jeff lets out a groan of discomfort as he feels the lower part of his body become hard concrete, he then feels his feet and legs fuse together, his cock also starts to feel weird. His cock feels as if it would erect, without Jeff feeling aroused, his cock grows and thickens, becoming a sewer pipe and starts to burying itself through the ground, towards the main road. Jeff can feel additional pipes starting to branch of his “main sewer pipe”, as it continues its “journey”. The teen suddenly lets out a scream of pain, as he feels the end of the “pipe” being bolted to the sewer.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “ouch,” he says, sarcastically, “that sounded like it hurt. I guess your “sewer pipe” has been bolted to the sewer… hehe!”<br />
<br />
With tears in his eyes, Jeff gives Ken a hateful look, “y-you m-motherfucker,” he says, Ken just continues to grin.<br />
<br />
Next Jeff feels his feet and legs morph into a block of concrete, then the block starts to expand and every direction. The teen feels the “block” splitting into multiple rooms: Boiler room, Wine cellar, Washing room with a washing machine and dryer, Entertainment room with movie theater seats, a huge screen, arcade machines, pool table and an indoor pool. Jeff then feels the rest of his body start to grow, his skin becoming concrete, he feels his head flatten and expand, becoming the flat roof of the house. His hairs become plants, chairs and table as it becomes a terrace, his nose disappears, his eyes widen, becoming huge windows, as additional windows appear all over his growing body. By now, Jeff must at least be four stories high, while his face continues to change, Jeff feels the inside of his body already undergoing own changes: he feels the inside of him being divided into four separate floors, which divide into rooms. The ground floor has the living room, the kitchen, a huge dining room. Jeff feels his more of his bones and organs change, becoming the stairs case, furniture and anything a house needs. The transforming teen feels his brain disappear from his skull, which has become the fourth floor’s office and library, and reappears in the cellar, having changed into the house’s Security room complete with a huge monitor, server and a dashboard with buttons and switches. Jeff’s arms have merged to his body, only his hands remain, which are flat on the ground, but now they start to expand, one becomes the garage, which has room for at least four cars, Jeff feels a door forming which allows a secondary entrance into the “House”. His other hand stays flat, but turns into pavement, Jeff feels his hand and fingers start to lengthen, becoming the drive way, back terrace and an out door swimming pool. Jeff’s belly button grows and becomes the huge main entrance of the “Mansion” he now has become.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles wide, his eyes sparkle, “oh. My. God,” he breaths, “The house is AMAZING! I can’t wait to see the inside,” so with that, Ken starts to walk up the driveway. As he walks up the driveway, Ken notices a high fence and gate come out of the ground, “hehe… looks like some of Jeff’s bones are becoming the fencing and gate of my new home,” he says to himself, “hehe… I must say, he turned out great, from what I can tell, he has a nice white color and just looks amazing! I hope the inside is also just as I hoped for”.<br />
<br />
When Ken enters the house his eyes widen and his mouth hangs open, he then grins, “IT’S AMAZING,” he shouts, he then checks out every room, he also flushes some toilettes, turns on the sink and just does anything to make Jeff feel unpleasant.<br />
<br />
After having some fun, Ken sits down on the couch in the living room, “man, this couch is effing comfortable,” he says, “I wonder what part of Jeff it is… hm… bleh… who cares? Hehe… hm… now, what should I do next? I could transform someone into my dream car, throw a party, transform two people into two big guard dogs, transform someone into a nice front yard ornament, like a statue made out of Marble… So many possibilities!”</p>
