<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One day you woke up in the middle of the night only to suddenly get hit with an intense wave of pleasure. You were a young college man, 20 years old, and studying geology at a university located just outside the Grand Canyon in Arizona. Your dorm was on the bottom floor and you woke up to see everyone else at your dorm violently jerking off, and changing. You were among them, stroking your cock and squeezing your balls with an undeniable, irresistible lust that overwhelmed your body. <br />
<br />
While this happened some sort of instinct told you that the room that you were in was extremely small, and you started feeling claustrophobic even so you scrambled for the door. While this happened your body started growing and your muscles started bulking up rapidly, but somehow your cock grew smaller yet somehow increasingly sensitive. You couldn’t feel your balls either, only the thickening dry scales around your genitalia and a moist slit that was slowly devouring your manhood. <br />
<br />
You couldn’t think straight with everything that was happening and you fell to onto your stomach in the lobby of the building and started pulling yourself towards the exit with one arm while your other pinched the tiny noodle that was your cock. Using the sheer strength from one arm alone you made it out into the campus just before you felt your large clawed hand plunge into a set of plump moist lips, and you let out an enormous guttural roar that echoed throughout campus. You head then hit the ground with a large slam, but the second it did...<br />
<br />
________<br />
<br />
<br />
You woke up and snarled, grasping your head and shaking it before looking towards your surroundings. &quot;Huh?! What?! Who’s....?&quot; You shouted then paused as you saw the familiar darkness around you, accompanied by dirt, rocks, and the occasional muddy puddle. You looked up and saw your girlfriend, a bat girl who used to be your roommate at college, Alex.<br />
<br />
She had soft gray and white covering her beautiful endowed body, she held a few rocks in her wings and she hung upside-down above you and sighed,&quot;Oh thank god,&quot; She then dropped the remaining boulders in front of you and crawled down in front of you and said,&quot;You were having... another nightmare, are you alright?&quot; You looked down at her now and rubbed your eyes as your mind returned back to reality and you took note of her amply sized breasts, as well as her wide hips and her plump rear that brought her whole body together. <br />
<br />
You then looked down at yourself and saw the tan scales all over your body that blended into the sandy desert outside of the cave. You took note of your enormous frame as you tried to stand up and hit your head on the ceiling of the cave, and you resorted to getting down on all fours. &quot;Agh, damnit!&quot; You snarled and Alex cried,&quot;Careful, you aren’t as small as you us... erm.... me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at your breasts, which could probably fit ten to fifteen kegs of beer inside of them, that is if they didn’t already hold tons of milk. You looked at your large 3 digit clawed hands and your large three toed feet, and you sighed then grumbled,&quot;Yeah yeah, I’m half-asleep, and a 20 foot monster lady with big tits, I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren’t a monster, Bailey,&quot; Alex replied, and you looked down at her with your two golden eyes that practically pierced the darkness of the cavern. You ran your hand along your head to feel the horns and spikes that trailed from your forehead to your tail, and then looked at the spikes jutting out of your knees and elbows that were surrounded by almost impenetrable scales that were basically like bulletproof armor all over your body. You tried to stretch out but you couldn’t seem to do even that, so in response to Alex you sighed,&quot;Yeah yeah, doesn’t change the fact that I’m avoided by new folks because they’re intimidated, and some who stick around still don’t, but right now I just need some room to stretch out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You began to make your way out towards the moon light seeping into the cave and Alex crawled onto your back and hitched a ride, which you didn’t mind. After your transformation you freaked out before realizing just how much devastation there was around you. Later made your way towards the Grand Canyon for shelter, and met up with Alex and the two of you were surprised once you both found out who each of you were. That moment pretty much sealed the deal when it came to your feelings for her, since she seemed pretty open about herself towards you and you did her.<br />
<br />
-<br />
You met her again one night when she bit your into hind leg for a snack, being the perfect size to get underneath your scales, and you started freaking out and almost crushed her in the process. However, she soon apologized and was more afraid than anything else at that point, and she seemed desperate for survival. Afterwards you not only befriended her, but you allowed her to finish her feeding as long as she would help treat the wound she made. <br />
<br />
Afterwards you both realized that you had the same destination and decided to head out together, and during the day you traveled on all fours keeping her cool beneath you as you walked through the harsh desert heat. You were cold blooded, so you didn’t mind the heat and sometimes enjoyed it. Then at night she’d go out and gather cactus fruits for you, that were less than desirable to eat but you got used to it eventually, and she would occasionally feed from you again, although she took much more care into that now. <br />
<br />
Now she was just trying to help you adapt, and there was no doubt that you were in denial with your new body, especially the whole lesbian female part of it. This was what caused your reoccurring nightmares, and you wanted to go see a therapist about it, but then you remember that there’s practically no society anymore and you are stuck butting your head against a large boulder until it split. <br />
<br />
Still, you do admit that your new body does have a few benefits over your old one. You were far less dexterous and so large that you couldn’t use any sort of human device, much less enter through a door. However your physical strength was unmatched by anyone else in the canyon, and you could lift almost twice your own weight, which had to be around a ton, or more at this point. Then your intimidating appearance usually scared off those who took to raiding, or at least small groups of those smaller than yourself, otherwise you could tear anyone literally limb from limb.<br />
<br />
 In addition to this there were very thin lines of what was considered cannibalism nowadays you actually took to devouring what meat you could get from those invaders. You personally didn’t exactly enjoy this, but your mouth watered whenever you thought about red meat, so you couldn’t help yourself. Some in the society saw you as a beastly savage for this, but so many more others understand, usually nagas, zombies, vampires, and ants. Alex is indifferent towards it because although she agrees with your disliking towards it, she also acknowledges the thin line, and she would technically be a hypocrite if she thought otherwise considering she drank blood to sustain herself.<br />
<br />
Still the sound whenever you’re forced to tear someone apart haunts you to this day, and by now you’ve killed 3 people by either crushing them, or tearing them limb from limb. You want to be a pacifist, but whatever you became just didn’t agree with that whatsoever. So whenever you killed you did it out of self-defense or to defend others, and nothing more. Still your only methods for doing so are extremely brutal, and no doubt have taken a toll on you these past few weeks.<br />
<br />
Despite all of this though, some traders want to listen to these stories, and many understand while others just feel afraid. Those who understood just saw it as a part of nature, and didn’t blame you since you more carnivorous than omnivorous now. If one thing was for sure though, the colony in the Grand Canyon had its ways to take your mind away from all of this whether it be clearing a collapsed section of a cave, to just helping others move supplies. Alex also wanted to &quot;explore&quot; your new bodies more, and recently you’ve been thinking about getting pregnant. <br />
<br />
You had no idea how pregnancy would work now, but it does, and for some more... bountifully than not. You wondered what it would be like to get pregnant, and part of you wants it to be you as opposed to Alex. Mainly because you couldn’t imagine an egg coming out of her womb that came from something like you. You weren’t excited about this either, so you and Alex didn’t exactly try for children, but you were indifferent towards the topic now as a whole.<br />
-<br />
<br />
You got outside and stood up on your hind legs, and stretched out your arms beneath the cool moonlight, and Alex crawled down off your back and smiled up at you. &quot;It’s almost dawn you know? Wanna take a stroll around, Bailey?&quot; Alex asked and you looked down at her with a small blush and said,&quot;Yes... sounds pretty nice actually, just hope none of those... others are around...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex’s ears dropped and she rolled her eyes and said,&quot;Don’t worry about them babe, just think about all of those who agree with you and do the same. It doesn’t matter what everyone thinks, maybe you’ll meet someone new who won’t mind the company of someone like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You knelt down and nuzzled Alex’s small nose and kissed her on the stomach, being that it was probably the only place you could kiss without things getting too awkward. &quot;Okay Alex, just don’t start too many arguments for me, alright?&quot; You replied with a small smile on your face and Alex smiled and giggled,&quot;There&#39;s my gentle giant lizard, but you can’t stop me from being dragged into one.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged your shoulders and sighed,&quot;Fair enough, wanna hitch another ride on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, it’ll help when the sun comes out anyways,&quot; She replied and you getting picked her up and raised her up to your back and smiled as she crawled up to your shoulder and kissed your cheek.<br />
<br />
So far today didn’t seem like it was going to be too bad, but as you walked along the floor of the canyon you discovered that today was going to be quite eventful when you encountered...</p>
