<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hollow footsteps echoed throughout the monochrome library, piercing the silence that had fallen between the dragon and human. Scales tensing, the reptilian titan&#39;s head shot to the balcony overseeing the library with clenched teeth.<br />
<br />
Turning to face Ilvir, Isaac motioned for the human to stay put; receiving an understanding nod.<br />
<br />
Silently, the silver-scaled dragonman ambled through the library; slipping past the large central table and sheaves of books and papers to come across the stairway leading to the second floor. Ascending cautiously, Isaac flexed his claws. Nearing the corner that led to the floor of the balcony, he halted at the distinct sound of a voice, a conversation in progress.<br />
<br />
&quot;...The demons were useless, as expected. They gave in to their instincts and were promptly devoured by the dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<em>&#39;Sera.&#39;</em><br />
<br />
He recalled the unique tone the witch spoke with, a hint of fiery excitement masked behind a sheet of emotionless ice.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>I should have expected as much.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon&#39;s scales tensed at the second voice, gravelly and harsh tone grating against his ears. Bringing his wings and tail closer to his body, he kneeled. Peering out from the corner that led to the second floor, Isaac&#39;s golden eyes narrowed at the sight of both Sera and a robed entity. Upon examination, the robed figure appeared to be wearing an odd, cross-shaped mask. Twisted sigils decorated the black robe, otherworldly depictions of what appeared to be that of The Order; not unlike Sera&#39;s own robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Tell me more.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Upon digesting them, the silver dragon excreted the three in the form of black sludge.&quot; The witch&#39;s deadpan tone echoed, her hellish eyes burning with excitement. &quot;It was quite a sight, nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching beneath her cloak, the tainted witch revealed a small vial, a black liquid held within. <br />
<br />
&quot;He escaped, but thankfully, I managed to salvage a sample of his essence. I have no doubt it will serve us well in the near future.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Allow me.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
The masked figure extended a hand, revealing dark fur and white claws. Without hesitation Sera dropped the vial into the entity&#39;s hands, brushing back a lock of her brunette hair as she withdrew her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for the dragon…&quot; She continued, the masked figure examining the vial in interest. &quot;I have a feeling his presence does not signify good luck, nor does his discovery of…&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch&#39;s voice trailed off, her eyes narrowing with a gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;...How interesting. It seems we are not alone in this ethereal realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Oh?</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac cursed internally, withdrawing his face from the corner. Claws flexing, a divine light followed by ethereal runes formed within his scaled palms; the glow extinguished as his fingers flexed to form a fist. Silently rising to his feet, the silver-scaled titan stepped out from his position, the pair of eyes settling onto his form.<br />
<br />
&quot;How intriguing…&quot; Sera rasped, her eyes widening at the sight of his tail. &quot;I thought I&#39;d come to a brilliant hypothesis, and yet… it seems I&#39;ll need to harvest more of your essence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Golden eyes narrowed to daggers, Isaac&#39;s draconic maw twisted into a scowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>That claw in your chest, the radiant scales, and metallic sheen. It is just as Sera described.</em>&quot; The robed figure chuckled, the white eye at the front of its mask piercing through his soul. &quot;<em>But those are nothing compared to the burning flames within your eyes. That primal sense of rage.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d ask for enlightenment, but the sound of your voice is beginning to give me a headache.&quot; The dragon spat, wings and tail flaring out threateningly. &quot;I know better than to trust your kind as well. Do not think me of being so naive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Naive? Hah.</em>&quot; The masked figure scoffed, retrieving a black tome from its cloak. &quot;<em>No, dragon. Like all your kind, you are arrogant. And such arrogance must be put in its place, lest you become a thorn in the side of our plans.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plans.&quot; Isaac challenged, his axe-tipped tail whipping about dangerously. &quot;Hearing that word from one such as you does not instill comfort, nor must it mean anything noble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Hah! And who are you to decide what is noble? You haven&#39;t even granted me a second to explain to you what said plans entail.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I know all that comes out of your mouth is nothing but deceit and lies. The veil of darkness tainting you makes my scales tingle in revulsion. You have no place in this world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Very well,</em>&quot; The masked figure remarked, extending a furred hand to the witch at his side. The tainted witch grinned as she retrieved the vial of his essence, her amber gaze shifting to the dragon once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;How pitiful, but we still hold interest in that body of yours,&quot; Sera whispered, snapping her fingers with a grin.<br />
<br />
Roaring in shock, Isaac recoiled in agony as multiple runic glyphs shot up around him. Searing his scales and restraining his wings and tail, his maw clenched shut to restrain another roar. Out of desperation and primal rage, he willed his arm to extend, fingers outstretching to send out a blast of holy magic.<br />
<br />
Dark incantations echoing from behind its mask, a runic barrier formed between the robed figure and Sera; shattering to pieces as the bolt of light made contact. While weakened, the masked figure howled as the golden energy pierced into its flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; Sera cursed, leaping away from the howling Interloper. Her dark eyes shifted to the floor of the library, brow furrowed in anger. &quot;Where are they?! Incompetent fools!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sealing magic waning, Isaac reptilian eyes shimmered in feral rage. His barreled arms flexed, tearing free of the runic imprisonment. His freed wings flared upwards, whilst his tail swung about wildly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isaac!&quot; Ilvir&#39;s voice rang, piercing through the Progenitor&#39;s rage. <br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s draconic gaze shot to his side, the armored human rushing up the stairs to meet him. Holy magic encircled the palm of one hand whilst the other had black claws at the ready. Maroon eyes darted from him to the recovering interloper, to the tainted witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>My fellow brothers and sisters of Calmach! Invade!</em>&quot; The masked figure shrieked, slamming his open palm flat onto the stone surface of the library floor.<br />
<br />
The dragon and human grunted, magical spirals flaring up throughout the balcony floor. From the portals rose more robed figures, black masks of various designs shielding their features; although scales, fur, and other attributes could be discerned from their uncovered hands.<br />
<br />
 &quot;C-Cultists?!&quot; Ilvir shouted, firing a blast of magical energy at the closest figure. The paladin&#39;s face paled, his holy magic quenched by the combined might of dark spells.<br />
<br />
Tomes were held tightly in the grips of the gathering of interlopers, incantations hypnotic and alluring to the pair. <br />
<br />
Pupils dilated with rage, a bestial roar reverberated from the depths of the dragon&#39;s throat. Tail darting forth, an attempt to tear apart the group of cultists was futile as a chain of black coiled and yanked the appendage towards the ground. More chains shot from the ground to restrain the dragon, piercing into his silver scales and black plates.<br />
<br />
Despite his armor and increased muscles, Ilvir found himself screaming in agony as various blasts of dark magic tore into him.<br />
<br />
With a final snap and blast of magic, the roars and screams silenced as did the incantations. Ilvir&#39;s armored form collapsed without a word, knocked unconscious by the onslaught of foul magic. The dragon&#39;s form was tightly restrained by ethereal bindings, the combined might of the cultists managing to fully restrain him.<br />
<br />
Helped to his feet by a fellow interloper, the lead cultist glared at the dragon in subdued rage, fangs bared beneath the black mask. <br />
<br />
He shook his rage with an exasperated sigh, turning to meet Sera&#39;s dark gaze. &quot;<em>...We must depart back to the crypt. Lady Aeris and her brethren will no doubt find these developments to be of note.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch responded with a silent nod, although she found her gaze shifting to the armored human. &quot;Heh, it seems we&#39;ve been blessed with another as well. He&#39;ll have to wait though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heaving the restrained pair, the group of cultists were led by their leader and Sera to a door, not unlike the one serving as the entrance to the monochromatic realm; the gray light beckoning them.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
The ethereal library had fallen silent, the mass of robed cultists and their tainted witch leader having departed with the captured intruders through a black door atop the second floor.<br />
<br />
Light continued to shine through the stained glass in apathy, bookcases, and sheaves of papers undisturbed by the battle that had occurred.<br />
<br />
Hollow footsteps echoed throughout the empty library, akin to the clicking of claws mixed with a faint squeaking.<br />
<br />
Lavender-colored eyes examined what remained of the monochrome dimension, light grey spines framing them. A reptilian maw poked out from beneath the hood, violet scales reflecting the rays of sunlight.<br />
<br />
A clawed hand rose to adjust his hood, shimmering eyes shielded from the radiant gaze of the sun. Granted the location, it was doubtful it truly was the sun. Even with the robe, he would&#39;ve been burning alive at this point.<br />
<br />
The figure&#39;s gaze fell to its feet in thought, claws poking out from the mass of black cloth that concealed his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>A silver dragon… how curious.</em>&quot; He whispered, distorted voice rumbling from the depths of his throat.<br />
<br />
The rage in the dragon&#39;s golden eyes, the power it had displayed. The way its silver scales shone akin to the metallic sheen of a blade, yet all the deadlier.<br />
<br />
And finally, the claw at its chest. The luster it radiated, it was anything unlike the stench of Corruption that plagued the crypt. No wonder Sera held such interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Perhaps… you&#39;re the one I&#39;m looking for.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
A small grin crept across his maw, clawed fingers pressing together with a squeak. <br />
<br />
The dagger in his palms glimmered faintly, rose-like jewel the color of lilac; matching his slitted eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Yes. You&#39;ll be a vital asset...</em>&quot;</p>
