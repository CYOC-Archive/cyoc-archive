<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being able to see through the balloon-suit that Cathy wore was enticing to Dean.  He could feel the desire to grab his penis more than ever.  If only it had not been made incorporeal by Jen's wish for a boy toy.  He needed to get some relief.<br />
<br />
Cathy jumped onto the couch next to Dean and her suit squeaked loudly.  Through the blue plastic Dean could see her dark nipples were very erect and straining to be felt.  Her toned mid-drift wiggled about as she wobbled within the air cushion.  Cathy pushed Dean over and lay upon him pinning him down.  She was laughing but she almost seemed mad; her hand searched his body feeling the perfectly molded muscles under his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are so hot,&quot; she said.  &quot;I am very hot and I need you to get me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean stuttered past his silly doll-grin.  &quot;Cathy, I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean, if this is about Jen ... it's no problem,&quot; she said.  &quot;I have the curse.  I could make it so she won't notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not it,&quot; he said, a little horrified at Cathy's cavalier notion of altering reality.  &quot;I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean eased Cathy off him a little so that she could see what he did next.  With a fist he thumped his crotch.  The solid mass that form his cod-piece did not move.  His very tight pants demonstrated that there was no fooling.  Cathy moved her hands there as best she could around her bulky suit.  She quested for something that she needed more than ever but could not find anything.  Dean was even more disappointed that even her hands did not have any effect on the dead area.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's gone!&quot; Cathy said finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.  I can still feel something's there but it is missing.&quot;  Dean tried to explain but was unable.  It was wholly out of the ordinary for him to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I can fix this can I use it for a little?&quot; Cathy asked devilishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Dean said a little lost how she was going to do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean, Transform or Dare?  Pick Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform,&quot; he said trustingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean, I want your penis to transform into an amazing, remotely controlled dildo, that you can feel what it is doing no matter where you are or where it is, and I want it to magically appear in my vag right now where it will remain until you take it from me.&quot;  Cathy smiled, wide-eyed as she spoke.<br />
<br />
Suddenly between them right where it would have been, Dean's penis appeared.  Erect and proudly large his dick balanced on his cod-piece outside his tights.  As they watched it suddenly became hard rubber before toppling over and falling down into the pillows of the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Dean said as he felt his penis suddenly clamped between two soft, leather couch cushions.  He bucked his hips suddenly and he could feel his penis rubbing back and forth.  &quot;Oh!  Grab it!  Grab it!  Get it fast!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy dropped her hands down where the dildo had gone and fished around for a moment.  Suddenly she pulled the new toy free and held it aloft triumphantly.  Her sweaty hands cradled the thing tightly as it twitched and wobbled.  &quot;Hee, hee, hee, it's so warm,&quot; she cooed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it back,&quot; Dean said.  The way she was tickling the shaft was sending amazing feelings through the ether to his groin and then to his brain.  &quot;That's mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for a while, Dean,&quot; she said bounding off the couch.  &quot;You said you would help me out and right now I need a lot of help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean wiggle his hips a little and tried to think of some way for her to let go of his penis.  Cathy suddenly shrieked as the dildo started vibrating wildly in her hands.  She dropped it and bounced off the carpet.  Dean felt a sudden kick in his groin that was more pleasurable than painful.  On the bounce, the penis leaped up and popped through Cathy's suit as if it was not there.  Her hands tried to follow but found only solid plastic film.  The dildo flew like a spear straight to Cathy's vagina and slid home where it parked itself and held.<br />
<br />
Cathy gasped at the speed at which she had been penetrated.  But it was followed by a feeling of accomplishment.  Dean suddenly felt warmth and pressure around his wayward penis.  Instinctively he pulled back with his hips and Cathy felt a sudden pull on the dildo but it did not withdraw.  Dean tried again and Cathy squealed in pleasure.  Dean tried to focus on steadying his penis and instead found it vibrating.  Cathy's eyes closed as she moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it up, Dean,&quot; she gasped.  &quot;That is amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, give it back!&quot;  He tried to demand but he too was feeling the amazing tingling and rubbing.  A moment later his knees became weak and he tumbled back onto the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to but I can't seem to get close to it right now.&quot;  Cathy said as her breathing became fast and short and she shuddered suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I fix your clothes will you give it back?&quot; Dean offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?  Can't you feel this?  It's the best feeling I have ever had.  You can have it back when I get tired.&quot;  Cathy said and she danced around the room.  Dean tried to follow but his tight pants and stimulated groin prevented him from moving at his normal speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it back or I will make things worse,&quot;  Dean said loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; Cathy taunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, Cathy, Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
