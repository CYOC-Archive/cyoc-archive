<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, when Jared woke up, he realized that there was no school because it was a holiday.  However, that didn't stop him from having baseball practice.  As the team catcher, he couldn't play without a jock and cup.  He had a spare jock, but didn't really want to go to the store to buy a replacement for the cup he chewed up the day before.  Even though he was 17 and had been playing sports for some time, he was still a little embarassed about the privacy of purchasing such an item.  <br />
<br />
He wondered if there wasn't some way that the medallion could help him out.  He knew that putting on the collar with the medallion, or even holding it, would turn him into a sheepdog.  But could there be other possibilities?  The very first time he transformed into Shaggy he had been thinking about uses for the collar.  What if you thought about a use as something without a pulse?  He figured this would be a good way to test out the powers of the medallion, and teach his brother a lesson, too.<br />
<br />
When he knew his parents had left for work, he slipped across the hall and into Kevin's room.  He was wearing his batting gloves, just to be sure, and held the medallion in one hand, and his spare jock in the other.  He reached out and grabbed his brother's shoulder, shaking him to wake him up.  &quot;What?  I'm up! I'm up!&quot;, came Kevin's response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I want to do an experiment.  Only this time, you're the guinea pig&quot;, Jared informed him.  Kevin wasn't sure what he was talking about, but then he noticed what was in Jared's hands.  &quot;I let you turn me into Shaggy, and because of it, I don't have a cup to wear for practice.  I want you to take the medallion and my jock and think about becoming a cup.  I need one for practice today, and since it's basically your fault that I don't have one, this seems like a good idea to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin thought about it for a minute and figured, how bad could it possibly be?  It's just a piece of hard plastic, and after he turns back into himself again, he can play with Shaggy some more!  He agreed, and took the items into his hands.  Kevin wasn't sure exactly what to do, so he just visualized a cup in his mind, concentrating hard on it.  Jared looked on, wondering if it would even work.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden Jared noticed it.  Kevin's skin was turning pale, almost pure white!  Kevin's eyes shot open, and then seemed to disappear.  Jared could see straight through Kevin's head.  As his legs and arms started to meld into his torso, Kevin's body was taking on more of a sheen, rather than flesh.  More holes appeared on his chest and stomach.  Then he started shrinking rapidly.  From the back of his body a gasket seemed to creep around his edges.  Almost instantly, the last of his body contorted into the shape of a protective cup, much like the one Jared had chewed up the day before.<br />
<br />
Looking at his brother's bed, all that Jared saw was his jock, a cup and the medallion.  &quot;Wow!&quot;, was all that he could muster.  He picked up the cup and looked it all over, searching for any sign of his brother.  For all intent and purposes, it looked just like any other cup, nothing spectacular about it.  He figured he might as well get ready for practice, so he put the cup into his jock and snapped the pouch closed.  Laying it on his own bed, Jared then went in to take a shower before getting dressed.  He figured the least he could do was put his brother on clean!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, from Kevin's perspective, things seemed very different.  He could sense things, and feel things, but he couldn't respond in any way, shape or form.  He could feel his brother picking him up and placing him in the jock, and he could feel himself being laid on the bed, but that was about it.  It was all very unusual for his still human thought process.  When Jared came back in, he could feel himself being put into place, and a certain fullness with his brother's cock and balls tucked inside of him.  With every step Jared took, he could feel himself being shifted around, back and forth against each leg.  It would have been enough to make him sea-sick, if he were still human.<br />
<br />
Jared rode his bike to the school for practice.  They held their practices earlier in the day when school was out.  The whole day was pretty uneventful.  They had 2 hours of practice during which Kevin only took a few hits, but Jared was glad he had something to protect himself.  Kevin did great at his job and kept Jared virtually pain-free.  For him, it was pretty much just an occasional adjustment or hit that gave him something to think about.  Otherwise, Kevin was pretty much in a vegetative state.  <br />
<br />
When Jared got home, he went upstairs instead of taking his usual nap.  He took off his uniform and carefully removed his brother from his jock.  Laying Kevin on top of his own pajamas, with the medallion touching both the pj's and Kevin's cup body, Jared told him it was time to think about turning back into himself.  As he watched, his brother's cup-shape seemed to inflate, becoming more pinkish instead of white.  After only a few moments, Kevin was sitting on his bed again, naked, looking like he just woke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was really strange&quot;, was all Kevin could say.  Jared asked him about his experience, and Kevin explained how he could just sense and feel things going on around him.  Although he did tell his brother that he adjusted himself too often, he said it was neat to feel the vibration from the ball hitting him.  It felt tingly all over, like when your foot falls asleep.<br />
<br />
Now that Kevin was starting to come back to life, he looked at Jared and asked him how he was doing.  Jared told him that he was kinda tired, but not nearly as tired as he would have been if practice had been after school.  Taking this as his queue, Kevin added, &quot;So, are you too tired to be Shaggy for me?&quot;, giving a big smile as he asked.  Jared felt a surge of excitement run through his body, and he cock even started to rise at the thought of being the sheepdog again.  &quot;Yeah, yeah!&quot;, Jared exclaimed, trying not to sound too eager.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, bend down here&quot;, Kevin instructed as his brother leaned forward.  Kevin then fastened the collar and medallion around Jared's neck once more.  The fun was about to begin all over again!</p>
