<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James held the amulet in his hand. Even though he won the argument, he felt a little bad.  He felt selfish not wanting her to have it over him. She only wanted to see if it was pretty. Eventually, the feeling ate away at him enough to overcome the weird desires he had for the amulet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Danielle,&quot; James called, &quot;Catch.&quot; She made a motion to catch and James tossed the amulet, which shimmered as it arced into her waiting hands. She smiles and looks at the amulet and the things written on it. She frowns and looks over at him with a questioning face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;, he shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s supposed to be a good luck charm for love and stuff.&quot; She shrugged back at him and held the chain over her head. Since there was no clasp, she simply dropped it around her neck.  James&#39;s brow furrowed as the ruby began to glow. He looked up at her face, only to find her looking at herself through her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it looks like it&#39;s kinda--&quot; James said, before stopping abruptly. The Amulet exploded in a light-show of white beams, which all shot out from the amulet. James sat dazzled by the sight as  the light seemed to come from nowhere but inside the ruby. Then, all at once,  the light show stopped and the amulet looked the same as it did before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda looks like what?&quot; James&#39;s sister said, and stared at him. James coughed and looked up from the amulet on her chest to ask how she didn&#39;t just see that. He remained silent however. He was shocked silent. His sister&#39;s face started to change. He watched as her mouth and nose began to push outward, like a lizard. From the edge of her lizard muzzle, purple scales exploded outward, and quickly covered her face. As the scales touched her hair and eyebrows, they shriveled into her skin. In place of her hair, three pairs of white horns had burst up from her head, and pointed back, towards the head rest. Her ears shriveled into small ear holes as her jaw grew into her muzzle, masculine and thick. &quot;...All right then.&quot; James&#39;s sister said, as she faced forward, careful not to stab the headrest with her horns. As for James himself, he just watched in awe as his sister continued to change more than just having a dragon&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
The next thing to change was her neck, growing thick, muscled, and purple scaled. It grew longer, letting her bow her new scaly head, which she did to avoid the head rest. It&#39;s at this point, James realized something. She was turning into the dragon headed man like on the ruby! James gulped, and wondered to himself. Will she turn into a man? He gasped as the amulet answered his question immediately. As the purple scales moved their way down his sister&#39;s neck, her breasts rapidly shrank. Then, just ask quickly, they bulked up, becoming pectorals, which strained against her t-shirt. Suddenly, her height exploded upward, until her horns strattled the roof of the van, even when she craned her long neck down. Her muscles swelled in proportion. James could see  her muscles through her clothes.<br />
<br />
All at once,  they give up and tear away with a loud rip, falling into the seat below her. Not even her panties survive, and she&#39;s left completely naked. The scales have already spread to her arms,  which fall to her side, buff, as if she had lifted weights quite often. Her hands clack against her phones screen as her fingers grow white ivory claws at the end of them. She suddenly moaned sensually, and James looked at her face to see what&#39;s wrong. Her dragonic head is tilted back, almost pressed flat against the roof. She dropped her phone, and held her clawed hands in front of her. She spread her legs, and let James see what she was doing.<br />
<br />
Out from her pussy, a cylindrical tube pushed out. It pulsed and throbbed, growing longer every second. Before long, it turned from pink, to a lighter shade of purple. It grew until it tapered into a single piss-slit at the end. With two loud pops, James watched a monstrously large pair of purple scaled balls settle below the fleshy rod his sister had just grown. They matched in proportion to the pulsing purplish rod that reached up  to her own muzzle. James gulped, he supposed he can&#39;t call his sister a &#39;her&#39; anymore. As if in response to James&#39;s realization,  his sister cried out, and his serpentine cock throbbed hard enough to rub the tip across the bottom of his muzzle. James sat, shocked into silence, as his sister experienced his first male orgasm. His seed slapped loudly against his jaw, falling onto the chair and his purple scaled body.<br />
<br />
As his sister let&#39;s all his male dragon seed loose, James watches the rest of his body change. His feet, covered in semen, quickly reshape until they&#39;re purple-scaled, three-toed talon-like appendages. A large purple tail snaked out from behind the orgasming dragon person and coiled around the seat. At this point, James looked over his sister turned male dragon person, completely awe struck. He, she, looked completely different! If he hadn&#39;t watched the orgasming creature change before his eyes, he wouldn&#39;t have believed it was her. Eventually, with the changes over, his dragon sister&#39;s orgasm died down. He panted loudly, letting his forked tongue hang out the side of his muzzle. His entire length retreated inside him, leaving only his balls and a genital slit visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw shit.&quot; the purple dragon man said, coming to. &quot;I&#39;m sorry guys, but I just came all over the seats, and myself.&quot; The purple dragon said rather calmly, having just experienced such an intense orgasm. From the front seat, his father simply sighed. &quot;It&#39;s fine. We prepared for this, there&#39;s a gas station up ahead. We can clean you off there.&quot; The purple dragon smiled at his still shocked brother, shrugging as if to say &#39;oh well&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you were right James,&quot; the dragon said as he did his best to remove the amulet without getting his fluids on it, &quot;You knew wearing the necklace and seeing how my body looked with it on would make me horny. I&#39;ll trust you next time. &quot; With that, James&#39;s sister tossed him the amulet which landed in his lap. He sits, confused at how his father was prepared for this. The car turned sharply, and landed in a gas station parking space. James, still unsure of what to do, simply grabbed the amulet and exited the van. The gas station was pretty rural, but at least had a bathroom. His sister stepped out as well, his size overcoming the vehicle&#39;s height quite easily. His body squished as he moved while covered in his cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting some water for the dragon wipes.&quot; Their father said as he walked briskly to the gas station front.&quot;It&#39;s a good thing dad is so understanding, eh bro?&quot; the purple dragon says, adjusting himself. James looked away in disgust as the dragon semen dripped out his sister&#39;s side of the van onto the ground.  The odor of it was already quite noticeable, and James really wanted to be somewhere else right now.</p>
