<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You two come on up.” I said, as I pointed the two girls that I knew were freshman cheerleaders. As they got up to head to the stage, I noticed what they were wearing as a costumes. One looks like she was wearing a bikini, high heel boots and a jacket? The other one was wearing a shirt and a diaper for teens? <br />
<br />
Now, I knew these two very well and these were the freshmen that have a codependency. The one wearing the bikini was the more dominant, but it was more of an equal partnership. Sometimes the one wearing the bikini will be the one to make the decisions and the one wearing the diaper would agree. Or sometimes they would finish each others sentences.<br />
<br />
They finally reached the stage, and I shook each of their hands.<br />
<br />
“Well ladies why don’t you introduce yourselves?” I asked them as they turn to face the audience.<br />
<br />
“I’m Summer and this is my friend Katie.” Said the cheerleader in odd outfit.<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you.” I said before giving them a critical look. “ I admit I was surprised at how you guys are dress for this party.” I pointed to Katie. “ I mean, I know you’re a baby but…” I pointed to Summer. “What are you supposed to be?”<br />
<br />
“It’s random stuff put together, but I’m a prostitute.” Summer said. Okay now the outfit started to make sense.<br />
<br />
“Okay but wouldn’t your parents have a cow if you were dressed up like that as a costume?” I asked bewildered.<br />
<br />
“They wouldn’t care; my home life is not really good.” Summer responded.<br />
<br />
“How come?” I asked, and Summer gave a look as if she was tired of explaining this.<br />
<br />
“My parents had me late. By the time I turned five they were 10 times my age and old enough to be my grandparents. Any sibling I had just moved on way before I was born. Long search for didn’t care what happened to me.” Summer explained.<br />
<br />
“Okay what about her?” I ask referring to Katie. She seemed to shrug.<br />
<br />
“Absentee mother, dad died when I was young, siblings don’t give a shit.” Katie responded.<br />
<br />
“I’m starting to see why you two are attached to each other. You both are looking some form of connection.” I commented, looking between the two of them. With that an idea when I was going to do them came to my head.<br />
<br />
“I can work with that just stand where you are standing right now and don’t move no matter what.” I instructed both girls nodded to me to confirm to me that they will listen. I then grab one of the sheets and tossed over Katie before doing the same to Summer. I then stand between the two of them my right hand with the ring finger over Katie while my left hand was over Summer. I silently made my wish and tap them both on the heads.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see if I can make their relationship better.” I said to the audience. I moved my left hand up, and Summer grew with it until she was close to my height, maybe an inch taller. With that was done I pushed down on Katie and she rapidly shrink in that sheet she was under until she was a small wiggling mass. <br />
<br />
When I was done I moved to the front of them and pulled the sheets off of them, revealing where Katie use to stand was now a crying baby girl, maybe six months old and nothing but a diaper. In Summer’s place, was well Summer but she aged a decade, and her outfit was still the same, but the addition of fish leggings. She also grew a couple size as well because her hip size and her bust size screamed MILF. Summer looks like she didn’t recognize where she was until she spots the crying Katie.<br />
<br />
“Katie!” She cried as she scooped up Katie before turning her attention to me and the audience. “Who are you? Where are we? How do we get here?” She asked as she bounced the crying Katie. I hold up my hands to let her know that I mean no harm and to calm her down.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay. It’s okay. You’re safe my name is Joe. I’m a magician performing at friends birthday party. One of my tricks is I make a random person appear out of the air and not as you and your daughter I take it.” I said try to calm her down. it seems to be working as she relax however Katie still kept crying. She looked down at Katie before looking back up to me.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry she’s just hungry. Do you mind if I?” Summer asked before I cut her off.<br />
<br />
“Sure be my guest.” I answered and was that she pulled down one of the cups from her bikini letting one of her breast-free. She then lift up the crying Katie to it, who then latch on and start suckling. That stop the crying and I didn’t need to turn around this gage reactions from the audience at the sight.<br />
<br />
“So sorry for teleporting you here do you mind if you could give us your name and age and your profession?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Well my real name is Summer. I’m 25 years old and single. Finally, I’m a prostitute.” Said Summer.<br />
<br />
“Why are you a prostitute? What happened to your parents, your family, and why is the babies father not involved?” I asked confusingly well confusingly to the audience. They knew the truth that this was one of their classmates.<br />
<br />
“My parents had me late and by the time I turned 20 they were enough to be my grandparents. There was an age gap between me and my siblings by more of a decade. They tried their best to teach me some things mostly how to clean a house however, by the time it was, I graduated high school they kicked me out. Nowhere to go I turn to prostitution to pay the bills.” <br />
<br />
“And the baby?”<br />
<br />
“Sweet little Katie here was an unfortunate result of one night I didn’t use protection or birth control. She’s been a boom in my life even though she’s a financial burden. The father is practically nonexistent.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry to hear that and the fact that you have an unstable job, but what are you going to do not unless something better comes along…” I started to say.<br />
<br />
“Hold on a minute.” Called out Mrs. Brockman as she got out of proceeded and had to the stage. Once she was on stage, she looked at Summer. “You mentioned you were good at cleaning. How well do you clean?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“So I could probably have this room clean in an hour flat.” Responded Summer defensively.<br />
<br />
“Can you take order as well and work well with others?” Ask Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“Yeah one of the things that my family instill me is working with others and cooperation.” Responded Summer a bit weirded out.<br />
<br />
“Tell me, would you ever try to seduce men on your own?”<br />
<br />
“Whoa lady listen my job is professional. I don’t try to convince men to leave their wives or do anything. It’s all just a business transaction.”<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry if you work for me you will not have to worry about transactions ever again only if you do your job right and promise not to go after any men.”<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute. Are you offering me a job?”<br />
<br />
“Yes it is come to my attention. One of my maids is underperforming and causing a little bit of trouble so I have to let her go soon. I’m willing to hire you.”<br />
<br />
“What about Katie?” <br />
<br />
“I have a soft spot for single mothers plus the pay I’m gonna give you will support you both. Plus there’s a nearby dormitory where you can move in and live. Free board and a stable job what do you say?” Mrs. Brockman ask. At this point little Katie has been done feeding and lift her over her shoulders and pat her back. Once she gave us satisfying burp, Summer cradle Katie in one arm while her other hand readjust her top and was now fully covered again. She then hand out her hand.<br />
<br />
“I accept.” Said Summer excitingly and Mrs. Brockman shook her hand. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to my team Summer now let’s get you into something more comfortable. Little Katie can stay in the nursery for the time being.” Mrs. Brockman said as she lead Summer off the stage. Everyone clapped at this as I took a bow.<br />
<br />
“Well that wasn’t unexpected development. Now for my next trick I need a volunteer.” I called out. Surprisingly a lot of people raise their hands.</p>
