<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Nobody said anything for a long while;
Danielle just clung to her mother, not
knowing what to think about pretty much
anything anymore. Her mother held her,
gently stroking her hair and rubbing at
the base of her ears, which she found
oddly soothing. It felt strange that even
though she was still thirteen, she was so
dwarfed by her mother; it made her feel
like a little child.</p>
<p>Danielle kind of felt that way anyway,
scared and lost in a strange new body and
a strange new world hiding behind the
borders of the familiar old one. Nobody
was what she had thought they were, and it
seemed like not even she could be counted
on; if her mother could so convincingly
grow into a woman in just a few years,
what might time do to <i>her?</i></p>
<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a yelp
from Kat. Danielle looked up to see her
sister scowling at Emily, who had rather
unceremoniously prodded her in the back
with a twisty silver wand. "You were
right, Jill," she said. "Not an iota of
magic anywhere in her, past, present,or
future. Whatever that transformation did
severed her ties clean."</p>
<p>Danielle's mother sighed. "I was afraid
of that. Any idea as to why?"</p>
<p>Emily shrugged. "That's the weird part.
I thought about what you suggested, the
children's no longer being direct
descendants, but as near as I can tell
they're still just as much your children
as they were before. Don't ask me how the
timeline sorted that out; I don't know.
It seems like it just plain cut their
ties to the family magic."</p>
<p>"W-what does that mean, Mom?" Danielle
asked.</p>
<p>Jill frowned. "Well, girls, it could be
worse, and I'm glad you're still the kids
I gave birth to as well as raised. But it
does mean that you're not going to get
your witch powers like this, not even once
you're eighteen again. And that means that
any hope we have of getting you back to
normal rests on getting the witch locked
in that caster's battery to change Kat
back so she can undo her spells."</p>
<p>"And on that note," Emily said, "I've
got the circle prepared for that. Jill, if
you wouldn't mind, I could use a hand
keeping things contained and focused."</p>
<p>Danielle's mother nodded, and the two
women moved over to the circle on the
floor and sat down on either side of it.
Kat and Danielle followed, curious, and
parked what they thought was a safe
distance away. The witches joined hands
around the circle and closed their eyes.
Danielle could see her mother's mouth
moving, but she made no sound.</p>
<p>As they continued, the little stone in
the center of the circle began to glow and
expand. It grew to many times its original
size, and as it grew it tapered out at one
end, taking the shape of...an egg?</p>
<p>The stone-turned-egg stopped growing at
the size of a large beach ball, the glow
fading from its surface. Emily opened her
eyes and stared confusedly at it. "Oh,
great," she groaned. "Something about this
Tanya Moonstone's essence is just driving
transformations plum crazy today."</p>
<p>"Is...is it going to hatch?" Kat asked.
Moments later, her question was answered
as there came a tapping from within the
egg. The two rabbit-girls rushed up for a
better look. The egg began to crack open
from the inside, and it wasn't long before
most of the shell had broken away. Laying
in the remains of the egg was a little
girl, no more than eight years old. She
was no ordinary human girl, though.</p>
<p>Judging by her non-human traits,
Danielle thought she looked like a hybrid
of the <i>Velociraptors</i> from
<i>Jurassic Park,</i> which, she recalled,
actually more resembled <i>Utahraptor.</i>
But she thought they had been saying that
raptors had feathers now, and this girl
didn't? Oh well, it wasn't the most
baffling thing she'd seen today by a
<i>long</i> shot.</p>
<p>In any case, the girl was human from
the waist up, except for scaly patches on
the sides of her head where her ears
should've been, yellow, cat-like eyes, and
forearms that, while human in shape, had
the scales and claws of a dromeosaurid.
Below the waist, it was a different story.
Her lower body was almost entirely
reptilian in build, save for the
mammalian-looking openings peeking out
from in between the ventral scales that
plated her underside. Her hips were broad
for a girl her age, and anchored two very
raptorish legs, tipped with the signature
sickle-claws on her big toes. Completing
the ensemble, a long tail, stiff like a
riding crop, grew from the base of her
spine.</p>
<p>The dinosaur-girl yawned, revealing a
mouthful of teeth halfway between the
human assortment and razor-sharp fangs.
She blinked and looked around the room.
"Where am I?" she asked. "Who are all you?
Where's my mom?"</p>
<p>Emily groaned. "Oh, <i>please</i> don't
let this be what I think..." she muttered
under her breath. She turned to the girl.
"I'm Emily. Who are you?"</p>
<p>The girl frowned. "I'm Tanya...um...I'm
Tanya somebody? I can't remember my last
name..."</p>
<p>Emily forced a smile. "All right,
Tanya. You're safe here, and I'll see what
I can find out about your mom if you'll
just wait here."</p>
<p>Tanya nodded and sat back in the
remains of the egg, fiddling with the bits
of shell and apparently not noticing that
she was naked, while Emily moved Jill and
her daughters over to one side of the
room.</p>
<p>"Dammit, I was afraid of this," she
said. "Kat's spell was fueled by Tanya's
essence; that's why she's a little girl
now. I was hoping to retrieve a wanted
witch, and now I've got a kid who doesn't
even know she's committed a crime."</p>
<p>"Well, can't you just age her back?"
Kat asked.</p>
<p>Emily snorted and shook her head.
"Nope. This is a different matter than a
simple magical de-aging. With someone like
you, who turned eighteen but got de-aged,
there's still eighteen years of
accumulated life-essence locked away, just
waiting for you to go back to being
eighteen again. Hers got burned away
fueling that spell, and probably in
generating this new body for herself; the
only thing attached to that body is the
life of the little kid Tanya Moonstone was
at that age. No aging spell can fake that
life-essence back into existence."</p>
<p>Danielle shuddered at the thought, but
had to ask anyway. "Does that
mean...?"</p>
<p>Emily nodded. "Yep. We're going to have
to wait for her to grow back up before she
can get started on fixing this mess.
<i>And</i> I'm going to have to find
someone to raise her until then."</p>
<p>Grow back up? That would take
<i>years!</i> She'd be in her twenties
before this girl became a witch!</p>
<p>Danielle couldn't take it anymore. She
burst into tears and threw herself into
her mother's arms. "Oh Mom!"she sobbed.
"No, no, no! I can't...I'm so small, and
I'm not supposed to be a girl, and what's
going to happen to me!?"</p>
<p>Her mother just held her, gently
shushing her. "I know, dear," she said. "I
know <i>exactly</i> how you feel."</p></p>
