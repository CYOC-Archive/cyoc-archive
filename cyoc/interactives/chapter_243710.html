<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kari and Genki were back in the kitsune realm traveling down a long road with open fields near them and they saw a few kitsune farmers that they waved to as they traveled. Genki was carrying a bag over his shoulder with fresh fruits and vegetables from his family farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope this food will convince Lady Ume to hear us out.&quot; Genki commented as Kari smiled while silently nodding.<br />
<br />
Kari was feeling a little nervous as she walked beside her boyfriend. Her grandmother, Lady Shizen, had asked her to negotiate a diplomatic relation with Lady Ume, a young kitsune leader that was left in charge of her territory after her parents had died early on in the war. Lady Ume was one of the last leaders left that hadn&#39;t come to the palace for diplomatic ties. Kari assumed this might have been either due to fear or age, but she was thinking of everything she could say to the young leader.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kari, you feeling okay?&quot; Genki asked looking over at Kari.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh yeah, sorry, I&#39;m just a little nervous. I want to show my grandparents I can do something like this. If I ever have a job one day in the kitsune realm, I think I might like to be a teacher, but being a diplomat might not be so bad either.&quot; Kari said as Genki noticed her wringing her hands together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something else bothering you? You can tell me.&quot; Genki asked in his kind tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Mason, I guess I&#39;m just still as concerned about him as my mother is.&quot; Kari answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve noticed that. Your mother has barely let him out of her sight in the last few days, while your mom has been picking him up every day after school and driving him home.&quot; Genki said recalling how Mika and Claudia had both been over the last few days.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t blame them. Mason may be old enough to take care of himself, but he&#39;s still my little brother, you know? I want to make sure he&#39;s just as safe.&quot; Kari said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know all too well what you mean. Emiko and I have always watched out for Nanami, and we would never let anyone hurt her. Kari I promise you, I&#39;ll do my best to look out for Mason like he was my own little brother.&quot; Genki promised as Kari smiled at Genki before stopping to kiss him on the lips before they continued on the road as both their tails wagged happily.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the two came before the gates of Lady Ume&#39;s domain. Kari explained to the guards who they were and were led inside and the two of them noticed people going about their day as best as they could, although Kari did notice that some of the supplies in their village seemed low. It didn&#39;t take them long to reach the manor house of Lady Ume and were led inside through the doors and made their way inside through the long hallway.<br />
<br />
As they approached Lady Ume, Kari was a little surprised at just how young this ruler was. She was a yellow kitsune with some red fur and two tails. She wore a very elegant kimono on her person and she looked to carry her dignity. Kari could see that Lady Ume looked barely old enough to be in Middle School. As they approached, Lady Ume&#39;s face sported a serious expression that came across as odd, almost like a girl giving a speech in front of her teacher. Kari and Genki came as close as they could to Lady Ume before getting on their knees and bowing towards Lady Ume who bowed back to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is our great honor to meet with you today Lady Ume. I am Kari, I am the granddaughter of Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen and on behalf of my grandparents, I would like to open relations with you as well as the other leaders who were affected by the war.&quot; Kari said as she then gave a smile that looked a little nervous.<br />
<br />
Young Lady Ume tapped her fingers seemingly deep in thought before she responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may be open to talking with Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen if you can convince me as to why I should talk with those that were once my enemies.&quot; Lady Ume said before she sniffed the air and looked towards Genki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you happen to have some food with you?&quot; Lady Ume asked Genki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes your ladyship. My family and I run our own farm. I&#39;ve brought grapes, peaches, strawberries, cherries, and....&quot; Genki said showing all the food he had brought in his bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a kabocha! Oh, I love kabocha&#39;s, it was one of the first vegetables my mother ever had me try. They always make me think of her when I eat them.&quot; Lady Ume said as she now began eating the kabocha.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll hear you out miss Kari, if I like what you say I&#39;ll come to the palace and begin talks with the other leaders.&quot; Lady Ume said as she continued eating the kabocha.<br />
<br />
Kari took a deep breath before speaking. &#39;Just think what Lady Shizen would say, just think of what Lady Shizen would say.&#39; Kari thought to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Ume, the civil war was a challenging time for many across our land. Many, including yourself were affected by it, but now that the war is over, the leaders across the land have been coming to the palace to offer peace negotiations with the other rulers to make sure another war will not come to pass. I&#39;ve seen many of the leaders come and go through the palace and many of them seem be quite friendly, I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ll come to the palace, you&#39;ll see the other leaders treat you with the same grace and dignity.&quot; Kari said as Lady Ume ate her kabocha seeming uninterested in Kari&#39;s offer.<br />
<br />
Kari let out a sigh knowing she wasn&#39;t getting through to the young ruler as she had hoped. Kari looks around the room and then spotted a portrait of young Lady Ume with her parents looking quite happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lovely portrait of you and your parents.&quot; Kari complimented as Ume looked at the portrait and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember when that portrait was being done. My parents had been busy for a while and they wanted me to pose for that portrait with them. I didn&#39;t want to at first, but my mother convinced me to do it so that one day....if they weren&#39;t here, then I could always look at it and think of them in times of need.&quot; Lady Ume admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what it&#39;s like to lose someone. When I was very little, much younger than you, I lost my grandmother. I only remember so much about her. She made the best cookies for me and my younger siblings. I know the world can indeed be a scary place, my youngest brother was kidnapped the other day, but rescued quickly because it was thanks to my family and others that we trust wholeheartedly. I can&#39;t promise things will get better quickly for you Lady Ume, but I can promise that in time, you&#39;ll be a brave, strong, and courageous leader for your people with people like me helping you out.&quot; Kari said as Lady Ume listened to Kari&#39;s words and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your words have convinced me miss Kari. Please inform your grandparents Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen that I will begin opening negotiations with them as well as the other leaders post haste.&quot; Lady Ume said as Kari and Genki bowed towards Lady Ume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Lady Ume, I will relay the message to my grandparents, and thank you for your time.&quot; Kari said as she and Genki now got up and made their way out of the manor and out of the village and began their trek back to the palace to inform Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a little worried there for a moment. For a while it seemed like she wasn&#39;t the least interested in what you had to say.&quot; Genki noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I tried thinking like Lady Shizen, like my grandmother. But when I saw the portrait of her and her parents, I thought about talking to her like I would a sibling. You know sometimes it pays being an older sibling.&quot; Kari admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re great as an older sibling and a diplomat in my opinion.&quot; Genki complimented as Kari now held Genki&#39;s hand and kissed him on the cheek as they continued their walk back to the palace.</p>
