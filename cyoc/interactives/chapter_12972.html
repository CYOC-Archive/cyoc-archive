<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The new Janet got up from the couch and headed toward the steps, while John turned his head and watched his wife go up the steps to change out of her work clothes he assumed. However what he didn't know was that his wife was not planning on entering their bedroom, she was planning on entering her son Jim's bedroom. <br />
 <br />
Janet stood out side the bedroom door and wondered whether she should knock. However knowing the fact that her old body was probably masturbating she grabbed the knob and turned and opened the door and gave the most stern expression she could pretend to give.  <br />
 <br />
Janet's old body had one hand wrapped around his cock with his eyes closed imagining what it would be liked to be wearing the clothes his mom had on. When he opened his eyes he saw his mom with a stern expression on her face standing in his bedroom in the same clothes he pictured himself in. &quot;Mom what the hell are you doing get out of my room&quot; he stated as he pulled the blanket at his feet over his cock and waist as his face got red over the embarrassing situation. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh shut up Jim, unless you want me to tell Jake and Jeff what you did today.&quot; Janet stated sternly.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What are you talking about&quot; Jim said acting ignorant.<br />
 <br />
Don't play dumb with me you think I don't know what you did in my room.<br />
Jim's face turned an even brighter red and gave an even more shocked expression then when she entered the bedroom. Jim hung his head in shame. &quot;What if I close this door so we can have a little talk.&quot; Janet stated, however Janet's old body didn't say a word as his cheeks were still a bright red. &quot;or I could get your dad and brother?&quot;<br />
 <br />
His expression changed from embarrassed to frightened at his mom's last remark. The thought of his dad or brother's finding out what he did today was too much as he began  begging his mom &quot;Please mom, don't please&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;All right&quot; Janet said and closed the bedroom door. &quot;Well&quot; Janet said pausing as she tried to think of the direction the conversation should go in.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I'm sorry mom&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh there's no need to be sorry.&quot; Janet replied trying to ease the tension in the room. To tell you the truth I can't blame you. My clothes look and feel great, so who wouldn't want to wear them.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I, I thought you always hated your work clothes.&quot; Jim stammered<br />
 <br />
&quot;I used to, however lately they6 just feel so comfortable and make me look and feel so beautiful.&quot; Like this blouse the way the silk shines and clings to my body yet at the same time rubs against my skin as I move around, its an amazing feeling. Janet said as she rolled her eyes in ecstasy. With her eyes focused back on her old body, she couldn't help but feel sorry for him since she knew exactly what he was thinking, thus she felt the need to help him get some sort of satisfaction. So she removed her blazer and placed it on the chair in the corner of the room and headed for the bed right in Jim's reach. <br />
 <br />
Jim couldn't help but stare at his mom who just took off her blazer and was making her way to the bed. He was looking directly at the gray silk blouse imagining what it would be like to be wearing it right now. To feel the movement of his arms beneath the silk material, to have the black buttons of the blouse fighting to hold his breasts in place. To feel the, however his thoughts were interrupted by his mom's voice.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Would you like to feel my blouse&quot; Janet asked as she held out her left arm<br />
 <br />
Jim's face lit up with excitement &quot;are you serious&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes, if you want to feel it just rub your hand up my arm.&quot; Janet said as she waited for her son to respond.<br />
 <br />
He slowly brought his right arm up and began moving his hand up and down his mom's forearm, loving the feeling of the silk.<br />
 <br />
Jim Jim Janet called out s Jim was lost in his own mind. &quot;This isn't the only reason you try on my clothes is it. Jim just sated back as he continued to move his hand across the silk imagining he was wearing the blouse. &quot;You love everything about me, my clothes, my jewelery, my body. You wish you had it all my clothes, nails, hair, ears, lips, feet, pussy, husband, sons, you wish you we're me. Am I right&quot;<br />
 <br />
Jim meekly said &quot;yes&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;However you don't feel like that all the time. Like after you masturbate in my clothes, you always regret what you did and thought. You even go as far as wish that you could be normal, but your not normal Jim. A normal person doesn't wear their mom's clothes, wishing they were their mom. Jim's head went down in shame yet he continues to rub the silk blouse. &quot;Now don't get me wrong, I'm not angry about it I mean I wish that you were a normal 15 year old boy who was into sports, school and just beginning to get into girls that never even wore or thought about wearing his mom's clothes since he wasn't in love with her the way you are with me, instead you treat me exactly like a normal 15 year old son would treat his mother. But your Janet went to say as she felt her son's hand instantly pull off her blouse. You don't have to stop rubbing my blouse Janet said as she noticed the look on her son's face it wasn't the same look of obsession, it was a look of disgust.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Why would I want to rub your shirt or blouse or whatever it is you call it&quot; Jim stated sarcastically.<br />
 <br />
Because you love the feel of the silk material as it rubs against your skin&quot; Janet said confused.<br />
 <br />
Jim laughed &quot;ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha have you totally lost your mind&quot; he said before laughing again &quot; ha ha ha ha ha&quot;<br />
 <br />
Janet started to get humiliated and then anger built up as Jim continued to laugh. <br />
What did you do right after school, you were in my bedroom trying on my clothes. Janet stated with fire in her eyes. Let him try to get out of this she thought as the anger still burned as she waited for an answer.<br />
 <br />
Are you fucking insane, thats fucking disgusting I would never wear someone else's clothes let alone my own mother's Jim replied furiously.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I don't believe you&quot;  Janet said knowing that she was right since she was in the bedroom with the clothes on. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Mom I had to stay after school to sign up for football&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Football? I ah you never played football&quot; Janet questioned as she studied her old bodies face and began to notice a look, a look that was very different.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Now I know you've lost your mind. You were the one who picked me up from all the games and practices.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Janet just looked at her old body who's mannerisms and attitude seemed totally different. This wasn't the same Jim that was rubbing her blouse it was a new Jim who wanted nothing to do with her. Janet backed away from the bed and started to go to the bedroom door.<br />
 <br />
Are you forgetting something? Jim asked as Janet turned and noticed his eyes were fixed on the chair and the black blazer on it.<br />
 <br />
Another sign he's different Janet thought as she made her way over to the chair, if it was the old Jim, or me we would have never said anything. Instead we would have waited until my mom, or myself left and tried on the blazer right then and there.  Janet picked up the blazer and headed out the bedroom door embarrassed, and humiliated after making a total fool of herself. <br />
 <br />
Janet clutched the blazer in her hand outside Jim's closed bedroom door, as she wondered what happened one minute she was saying how Jim was not normal and the next he was exactly like every 15 year old boy ever was. What did I do Janet pondered. She remember the ring, I made a wish she exclaimed to herself as she studied the ring on her left hand and thought, did this ring make all wishes come true. There is only one way to find out I wish Jim would come out of his bedroom and tell me that he will never tell anyone about our conversation we just had, and as far as he is concerned its forgotten already.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Janet waited by the door for a few seconds when the door opened up &quot; Mom I just came to find you, about our conversation we just had I will never tell anyone, and as far as I'm concerned its already forgotten&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh thank you Jim it's just that I have been so busy I just lost my mind for a second&quot; Janet stated realizing what power she now had<br />
&quot;Like I said its forgotten&quot; Jim said as he went back to his bedroom and closed the door leaving Janet in the hallway by herself. Which is exactly what she wanted as she thought about what her next wish was.</p>
