<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I&#39;d like for you to be a girl.&quot;  Elena said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Might I suggest we do this in a private place?&#39;  Said the Djinn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right.  Uh, I wish we were in my room.  Is that...&quot;  <br />
<br />
There was a flash of light, and for a brief moment, Elena felt weightless, before landing on her feet in her room.  &quot;...something you can...oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Translocation is a simple matter, Master.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can do more than just change people...well we can talk about your other powers later.  So if you&#39;re a Djinn, you&#39;re Arabic, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;No.  My kind came to be before humans existed.  Though many were drawn to Mesopotamia when humans began to build cities.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Well..either way, you spent a lot of time in the Middle East, so...I want you to assume the form of a 16 year old Middle Eastern girl, very pretty, with green eyes and really long black hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;How tall shall I be?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh...&quot;  Elena bit her lower lip.  She liked girls who were either taller or shorter than she was.  Obviously there were more girls taller than her than not.  &quot;Like, model height.  5&#39; 9&quot;, with long and sexy legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Should I be slender, or muscular?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, both?  Like, uh, a dancer or a gymnast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;And how large should my breasts be?  I...&#39;  The Djinn trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, what?  Do you have a preference?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Djinn actually sounded a little embarrassed.  &#39;Usually when I am asked to take female form, it is by pigs of men, and they give me gigantic breasts.  It is very uncomfortable.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Well, how about B cup breasts then?  Big enough to be noticeable, but they won&#39;t get in your way that much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Thank you, Master&#39;  There was a flash of light, and a nude woman appeared.  She looked stunningly beautiful and healthy, with a dusky complexion.  Though only a teen, she had a trim, sexy figure, featuring long, shapely legs.  Her hips on the slim side, and she had prominent pelvic bones.  A small tuft of fine dark hair grew between her legs.  Her breasts were not large, but perfectly shaped globes, with dark pink nipples.  Her facial features were youthful and exotic, and she had mysterious green eyes.  Her long, straight hair, black as a raven&#39;s wing, fell to just above her shapely calves.  She smiled, showing gleaming white teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this to your liking, Master?&quot;  The Djinn asked.  Her voice still sounded similar to Elena&#39;s, but it was a little deeper, with a husky tone that sounded quite sexy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...oh wow.  You&#39;re gorgeous!&quot;  Elena then realized she was staring and looked away.  &quot;Uh, I mean, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t realize you would be naked!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why wouldn&#39;t I be?  This body is newly born, and surely you wanted to see it?&quot;  The Djinn sounded innocent, but Elena was sure she was being teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, yes, I want to see you.  But you should have a choice in the matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How kind, my Master is, to treat me like a woman and not a slave.  I truly do not mind if you stare at me.  In fact...&quot;  The Djinn walked over to Elena&#39;s mirror, admiring herself.  &quot;I think I have done a good job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena looked, getting a good eyeful of the Djinn&#39;s trim, heart-shaped rear and sexy backside.  &quot;Uh...yeah, I&#39;ll say.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Djinn turned to face Elena.  &quot;Still, you seem uncomfortable.  Shall I clothe myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s probably a good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without a word, there was another flash of light, and the Djinn was wearing a light blue sundress, as well as a pair of strappy low heeled sandals.  &quot;Does this outfit please you, Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena gulped.  &quot;Y...yes.  Very much so.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Djinn walked over to sit on Elena&#39;s bed.  &quot;You know, if you want to have sex with me, I do not mind.  I can tell you find me attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...yes, but..I can&#39;t.&quot;  Elena admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?  Why is that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...well, I&#39;m demisexual.&quot;  She stammered out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not familiar with the term, what does it mean?&quot;  The Djinn enquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need an emotional connection with someone before...that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see.  So no casual sex, you need a partner that loves you, and you love in return.  A courtship, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that.  Sorry.&quot;  Elena blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there is no need to apologize, Master.  I was hoping to test out this form, but that&#39;s not important.&quot;  She crossed her legs.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh, do you have a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not.  I once did, but it was taken from me when I was Bound to the Ring.  You can give me one, if you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...that&#39;s sad.  Hey, could I free you?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;You could, but as much as I loathe my imprisonment, it is best you do not.  I was Bound for a reason.  When I had free will, I was very cruel to humans.  I doubt a few thousand years of penance is sufficient to have changed my nature.&quot;  The Djinn explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t seem like a mean person.&quot;  Elena pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for saying so, Master, but I can only act as commanded, or in your best interest.  Left to my own devices, I would entertain myself by sowing chaos and discord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, uh, first, how about Sahar?&quot;  Elena thought of the prettiest Arabic name she knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sahar...yes, that is a good name, thank you.&quot;  Sahar smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And next, what do you mean by acting in my best interest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were to come to harm, I would protect you to the best of my ability.  If you were unable to command me, I would use my discretion to keep you safe.&quot;  Sahar explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.  That sounds good to me.  Does that include protecting me from myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sahar quirked a delicate eyebrow.  &quot;What a curious concept.  I would have to be qualified to judge whether or not you were about to cause yourself harm.  I am not certain that I am, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, you could try, right?  And maybe give me advice if you think I&#39;m about to do something dumb?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...suppose I could.  No one has ever asked me to do such a thing.  Are you sure you trust me to that extent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t trust a lot of people&quot; Elena admitted.  &quot;But you said you&#39;d protect me, and that you have to do what I say.  I mean, you&#39;d never betray me, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you were a horrible Master, I would try to, but it would be very difficult.  I do not think you will be one.  That having been said...&quot;  Sahar seemed to come to a decision.  &quot;I swear I will not betray you, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena smiled.  &quot;Then I can trust you.  And it&#39;s Elena, please.  Not Master.  Now, uh, if there&#39;s ever something you want, or I ask you to do something you really don&#39;t want to do, please tell me.  You may have been a horrible person in the past, but I don&#39;t want you to feel like a slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sahar bowed her head.  &quot;Thank you, M...Elena.  I will keep that in mind.  So how do you want to explain me to those around you?  Or, if you prefer, I can become invisible to others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, uh, shoot.  What&#39;s a good excuse for you being able to live here...foreign exchange student?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Sahar tilted her head to one side with a slightly baffled expression that Elena found very cute.  &quot;I&#39;m not familiar with the concept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, you came to the U.S. from another country, and a U.S. student went to that country instead.  And my brother gets paid money for your room and board.&quot;  Elena explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.  I think I can arrange for your brother to be paid well.  I have no real need of money, but I suppose claiming to be from a wealthy family...how about this.  I am Sahar Abadi, my father is a very wealthy businessman from Lebanon.  I go to school with you, and we have all the same classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great, Sahar!  I mean you&#39;re a little young to be a senior, but I&#39;m not one to talk.  It just means you&#39;re really smart!&quot;  Elena nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I should be, as old as I am.&quot;  Sahar did smile though.  &quot;Would it be strange for us to share a room?  You seem to have a good amount of space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I guess not.  This actually used to be Dad&#39;s room, I moved into it after he died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh your father is dead?  I should have realized, since you mentioned your brother...he is man of the house, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris?  Yeah, he&#39;s 20.  After Dad died, he became my guardian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I am overstepping boundaries, stop me, but what about your Mother?&quot;  Sahar asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, her.  I don&#39;t know, she divorced Dad and left us when I was really young.  She married some rich European guy or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sahar frowned.  &quot;What a devilish woman!  It is good that you command me, I feel the urge to turn her into a snake!&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena laughed.  &quot;It would serve her right, but I don&#39;t even know her.  Revenge would be petty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph, as you say.  But if she ever came back into your life, I would want to do something cruel to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duly noted.  So one of the reasons I wanted you to be 16 is so you can drive.  Yes, I know you can &#39;translocate&#39;, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sahar laughed.  &quot;Oh so you want me to drive you around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know, sounds lame, but I can&#39;t drive yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be a simple matter to make you older, you know.&quot;  Sahar mentioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, but from what you&#39;ve said, that can lead to weirdness.  Better not do that without a good reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you say, Elena.  So what kind of car should I have?&quot;  The Djinn smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;</p>
