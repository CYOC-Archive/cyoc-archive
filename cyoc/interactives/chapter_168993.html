<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lupe couldn’t help but smile as she left the night club behind her, the club life was never for her. It was strange the water looked darker now as street lights and lights from homes came on. <br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” inquired Alejandro as the two of them swam away from the club.<br />
<br />
“I have only been a mermaid for two days now…still getting used to it.” Explained Lupe as the two of them swam horizontally, that was of course how people swam but it was still strange. “I mean the water is darker now, so I assume it is because the sun is down on the surface, but shouldn’t the sunlight not reach down here?”<br />
<br />
“Sunlight actually goes deeper than most people think.” Explained Alejandro before shrugging a bit. “Besides our eyes are adapted to see in the water, so…” <br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Lupe “I am still getting used to this.”<br />
<br />
“Took me a while as well.” Confirmed Alejandro as they swam up a bit passing over a massive crab which was carrying a large crate in its claws down the street. That was one thing that really confused the hell out of Lupe, mermaids and merman could swim upwards or downwards depending on needs, so doorways to business or homes could be multiple stories up and while elevators where a thing it seemed to be only for cargo. Swimming was the way to get around both on the “ground” and above.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we swing by the park for a while, my moms are likely putting my little brother and sister is staying at a friend’s place tonight and if I show up with you it will only be my moms and they will not ask as many questions as my siblings.” Said Alejandro<br />
<br />
“Sure, a walk or should I call it swim around a park would be nice.” Said Lupe as she thought for a moment. “Wait…Cura said your mother…”<br />
<br />
“My land mother yes.” Said Alejandro with some sadness in his voice which Lupe instantly hated bring up. “I was 11 when she died and my new moms took me in, with the birth rate the way it is there are no orphans for long down here.”<br />
<br />
“I understand, sorry I brought it up.” Apologized Lupe “I shouldn’t bring it up, my parents died a few years back as well which is one of the reasons, I was so ready to become a mermaid.”<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s go to the park and then I’ll take you up to meet my moms. They will likely grill you about what I was like on the surface.” Laughed Alejandro before he paused. “It is ok, that I have two moms right? Is that still a thing on the surface?”<br />
<br />
“For some people sadly yes, not me or any of my friends, two of them are lesbians.” Stated Lupe as  Alejandro nodded as the two of them headed to a park. <br />
<br />
Colton passed through the doorway with four mermaids hanging on to him or dragging him forward as they left the night club main room. The music died down a bit but in it’s place the sound of moans and groans filled the sea as before them was a room with a massive honeycomb like wall with what had to be at least a dozen small rooms all open at the front and in those rooms where mermans and mermaids making love. Somewhere couples, somewhere three somes, one was a massive orgy which had more mermaids and merman then he could count in the state he was in. <br />
<br />
“I’ll find us a cube.” Said the purple tail mermaid as she swam upwards, the room was multiple layers with cubes at different levels. It didn’t take long but after a moment or two she yelled down from one of the upper cubes. <br />
<br />
“Come on…” laughed a playful blonde hair mermaid with a deep orange tail with a few bits of yellow. All four of them swam up to find a large but not too large area with a simple mat on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Simple but lets make this fun.” Said the purple tail as she grabbed Colton and pulled him backwards into the cub on top of her while the other three memaids swam forward. The blonde with orange and white to his right, a green tailed mermaid with larger breasts but a shyer personal to his left and on the front was a red haired mermaid with bright red tail. <br />
<br />
“So Colton?” said the red tail as all four mermaids surrounded him.<br />
<br />
“Ready for some fun?” added the purple tail mermaid in his ear.<br />
<br />
“God yes….I have only been a merman for two days and I love it.” said Colton as all the mermaids shared a look with each other and smiled. <br />
<br />
“Two days?” said the Green tailed as Colton smiled. <br />
<br />
“That is just a folk legend.” countered the Blonde <br />
<br />
“But it is worth a shot to find out.” added the purple tail<br />
<br />
“What is a legend?” said Colton confused<br />
<br />
“Legend says former humans are more fertile then born merpeople for a few months…more likely to get pregnant and get someone pregnant.” Explained the red tailed mermaid with green eyes in a low sex filled voice. “Lets put that to the test.”<br />
<br />
Back at the bar, Harmony had still a little unsure about Eric, it wasn’t that he wasn’t a nice guy he seamed great but so many alarm bells where ringing in her head. 1st he was a guy and she was used to having so many of them at her work treat her like a bimbo that she always assumed that all guys would treated her like that until proven else wise. Then he said how he was in med school which really set the alarms off, a lot of doctors had played grab ass with her and other staff but since they were doctors HR would always look the other way, so she had a miss trust of doctors. She knew that not all doctors where like the ones she had worked with, truth be told only 3 or 4 where bad out of the dozens she worked with but those doctors where bad. Still she couldn’t help but think Eric wasn’t like them, so they had moved from the wall to a corner of the bar and she had ordered a “Dry” which was funny to say under the sea mix drink while he drank beer. <br />
<br />
“Ah…sorry I need to go, early class tomorrow.” Apologized Eric<br />
<br />
“I understand.” Said Harmony her heart sinking a bit. “Do merpeople have cell phones?”<br />
<br />
“In a way.” answered Eric with a chuckle pulling out something that actually looked like a seashell but clearly made from a plastic “I would ask for your number but since you have only been a mermaid for two days…can I give you mine?”<br />
<br />
“Yes…” said Harmony quickly before mentally slapping herself, she had only met this guy what an hour ago if that. Eric smiled which sent her heart racing as he wrote down his number and placed a hand on her shoulder before swimming away. In a similar “date” on land the guy at the bar had tried to grab her ass while he walked away, Eric was nothing but a gentlemen.<br />
<br />
“You look like you were having fun.” Noted Adrian as he took the spot that Eric had just left. <br />
<br />
“He was nice…” said Harmony embarrassed, so she decided to turn the tables. “I saw you and Cura getting very close on the dance floor…kind of rushing it a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe…” admitted Adrian with a blush “But it also feels right.”<br />
<br />
“Glad to hear.” Said Cura as she swam up as Adrian flushed a bit, he had just admitted he felt as if he was rushing a bit into a relationship. Cura must have read this thoughts as she ordered her drink. “You have every right to feel that things are changing too fast, they are. Only days ago you were on the land, it is natural to feel rushed.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks…where is Colton and Lupe?” inquired Harmony<br />
<br />
“I saw Lupe leave with a merman an hour or so ago.” Explained Adrian <br />
<br />
“And Colton…well let’s just say he is really enjoying the back room.” Laughed Cura “I saw him go in for four mermaids…he may be a while.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…this is a sex club?” said Harmony her religious upbringing making her stomach twist a bit.<br />
<br />
“Apparently to help increase the population there are rooms for sex everywhere…like they are as common as public restrooms.” Stated Adrian <br />
<br />
“But…but…what if Colton gets those girls pregnant how could he pay for four new lives and…” started Harmony as Cura raised a hand. <br />
<br />
“1st judging by the necklaces…two of the 4 mermaids are using our friend Colton as a stud, they are married to each other.” Said Cura as she saw the confusion on Harmony and Adrian. “I believe on the surface you used rings for marriage here we use necklaces.” <br />
<br />
“Ok…so two of those mermaids are lesbians and since they can’t get pregnant they are using Colton as a stud.” Said Adrian <br />
<br />
“But what about those pills you talked about with Chloe and Stacy…” started Harmony before she remembered. “They are still working on those and getting a stud is cheaper than some other artificial form correct.”<br />
<br />
Cura smiled and put her finger on her nose to tell her she was on the money. <br />
<br />
“I am not sure about the other two but did you think we didn’t have one night stands and the like down here. Also Colton has a very special tail, some people look at that a lot and some professional studs actually market themselves based on their tail.” laughed Cura as she took her drink before eyeing Adrian again, her eyes said all that was needed. Once she was done with this drink she would drag him back to the dance floor so make sure he was done. Adrian looked down at his simple brown and tan tail, he had to admit he hadn’t seen anyone with that color but it wasn’t a flashy color either. He looked up to see Cura eyeing him again with a warm smile, a playful smile which told so much in such a small moment. “Personally, I like the rare colors and the simpler colors.”<br />
<br />
“Why don’t I just head back to the hotel and leave you two love birds to wait on Colton to drag himself out.” Said Harmony with a roll of her eyes.<br />
<br />
The park was unlike anything Lupe had ever seen, there where tall columns of sea weed but it came in multiple different colors and the ones which didn’t where bio-luminance so they glowed in the darkening water. There was not a water feature but instead something like a bubble machine which made small air bubbles for merchildren to play in. The two of them found a park bench and just sat there and talked for a while and laughed. <br />
<br />
“So I am a hair stylist/artist what are you?” inquired Lupe<br />
<br />
“Not much, I am studying in what the surface would call a community college and working at a bar, I have the night off.” Explained Alejandro as suddenly a small shark came from behind them and right up to Alejandro. Lupe jumped up in surprise and backed away.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” inquired Alejandro<br />
<br />
“Well the merbaby who transformed my friends, her originally parents where killed by a shark, so why aren’t you concerned?” inquired Lupe as Alejandro laughed, as Lupe’s face became a little red in anger. True it was a small shark, maybe only 18 inches long and it was swimming around Alejandro and playfully running it’s side against him or bumping into him. Then she saw the collar located behind the gills. “It’s a pet.”<br />
<br />
“Yes and here comes the hard part.” Said Alejandro as he turned around to see a mermaid coming up, she was maybe 14 or 15 with short brown hair and a bluish green tail. She wore what would have been called a tank top on the surface but was considered very modest down here, it was custom for mermaids and merman to go around either bare chested or in bras and bikini tops starting around 20 until they where well into their 50s. The more Lupe looked at this girl, the more she saw everything was human made, her cloths where human, she had hair tie and a human watch on her wrist, all the merpoeple she saw had it on belts. She even had a human cell phone which clearly was busted hanging from a chain on her hip.<br />
<br />
“Cookie!!!!” yelled the mermaid as she looked up and saw Alejandro and her eyes flicked to Lupe, as a knowing smile crossed her face. “Ah…big brother, how are you doing.”<br />
<br />
“I am good, Breonna.” Said Alejandro as he held the shark. “You forgot to keep Cookie on her leash again…and aren’t you suppose to be at your friend’s house?” <br />
<br />
“She got sick, so who is your friend.” Said Breonna as she eyed Lupe with a grin that all younger siblings had when they found out something about their older siblings that could get them in trouble. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you take Cookie home, we will be home soon and I will make introductions to you and our moms.” Said Alejandro but judging by the look his sister gave him that wasn’t enough. “This is Lupe, we where class mates when I was on the surface and she has just become a mermaid.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” said Breonna her eyes widened as she swam forward right up to Lupe. “Tell me everything about the surface…I want to know, what does it feel like to walk and what is a desert like and…”<br />
<br />
“One question at a time Breonna.” Laughed Alejandro “She didn’t know how much you love the surface world.”<br />
<br />
“Like Ariel in the little mermaid?” offered Lupe as Alejandro nodded conformation.<br />
<br />
“Ok…can I show her my collection of surface stuff back home?” inquired Breonna<br />
<br />
“Ok, how far away is it?” inquired Lupe<br />
<br />
“About five stories up behind the two of you love fish.” Said a new voice as Lupe spun around to see an older looking mermaid, she had to be in her late 40s early 50s but still fit with short shoulder length blonde hair, a deep green tail and what had to be at least D cup breasts which were held back by a purple top with an open front with a few strands holding both parts together. She was giving the two of them a playful grin, but happy grin as well.<br />
<br />
“Hello son.” Said another voice from behind the 1st mermaid, as a second mermaid, this one with long brown hair that reached her but swam forward. Like the 1st she had to be in her late 40s early 50s and fit and while her chest was smaller (Not a lot smaller) she was possibly wearing more relieving cloths. Her top…if one could call it that, was two strips of blue cloth which wrapped around her neck before going down to her breast, which just covered the nipples before wrapping back around her back. The thing which made this one stands out was on the front side of her blue tail where two fins. Lupe remembered that some mermaids from different parts of the sea had stuff like that but she couldn’t remember where. This mermaid looks more series but not in a hostile way. “Care to introduce us?”</p>
