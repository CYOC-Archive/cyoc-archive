<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dan and Mike continued their forced embrace, the Magician moved towards the spot where Dan once was as he searched for something. Dan couldn&#39;t turn around, but he knew the Magician was doing something. &quot;What now...?&quot; He tried to ask defiantly, but his new de-aged mind caused it to come out somewhat timidly. &quot;All things come to those who wait. Especially good little boys such as yourself. The Magician finished what he was doing and went back up to the pair. &quot;Let&#39;s go for a little stroll, shall we?&quot; The Magician flicked his wand, separating the two. He flipped Mike around Dan&#39;s back and placed Dan&#39;s arms backwards. He then sunk Mike&#39;s body snugly on Dan&#39;s back, making it look like he was carrying him. &quot;Yes, this is as brothers should be.&quot; The Magician said to himself as he placed Dan back on the ground. All of a sudden, the two felt the pressure on their bodies dissipate. They were able to move their bodies freely. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Dan asked. &quot;Consider it a reward for bearing all that. Just follow my directions and I&#39;ll let you move freely.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot; Dan asked timidly. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s a catch. Just don&#39;t try anything funny. If Mike does anything funny, I&#39;ll have my way with you... ignore how I phrased that. Anyway, if you try something, your little brother will pay the price. You don&#39;t want any thing bad to happen to you, do you little Michael?&quot; &quot;Guh... No!&quot; &quot;Then its settled. Follow me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Magician started to walk ahead. Dan simply stood there, a mix of emotions. Mike hugged his body, slightly trembling. &quot;Daddy...&quot; &quot;All right...&quot; Dan started to move. It was a bit rough walking barefoot on the concrete road. &quot;God, I feel so helpless!&quot; he thought. &quot;This is the greatest shame a big brother... No, father dammit! A father could go through.&quot; Dan couldn&#39;t let this stand. He watched the Magician keenly. His back was fully turned. &quot;Mike... Hey Mike.&quot; &quot;What is it daddy?&quot; &quot;Do not make a sound.&quot; &quot;Wha... What are you doing?&quot; Mike asked with fear in his voice. &quot;I know you don&#39;t want to hear this, but I have a plan to take his wand from him.&quot; &quot;No, I don&#39;t wanna!&quot; &quot;Shh! Trust your father. Even if we fail, I&#39;ll make sure you take the blame, which means I&#39;m the one who will pay. Just put your faith in your big... father.&quot; &quot;No, I don&#39;t wanna...&quot; Dan understood full well why Mike was scared. He was too. &quot;Listen, Michael. He isn&#39;t letting us go. He might not do something now, but when we go to wherever it is we&#39;re going, we&#39;re gonna be his slaves for life for sure. Please!&quot; &quot;Daddy... Oh... Okay...&quot; That was all Dan needed to hear. He immediately put his plan into action. &quot;Whoa!&quot; He pretended to trip and fell face first onto the pavement. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?!&quot; The Magician asked as he turned around. &quot;Nothing... I just tripped is all... Whoa!&quot; Dan made a show of trying to get back up only to lose balance again. &quot;Oh for goodness sake!&quot; the Magician said as he walked towards Dan. &quot;Well, sorry! Hard to get used to such a weak little body so quickly. God, my penis!&quot; &quot;I suppose I did ask too much of you. Levi-&quot; But before the Magician could finish the spell, Dan got up and hit him in the arm with Mike&#39;s head. &quot;What?!&quot; the Magician cried out as he dropped the wand. &quot;Grab it, Mike!&quot; Dan whispered. Mike did just that and grabbed the wand. The tables had finally turned. <br />
<br />
&quot;How... How&#39;d you like that?!&quot; Mike shouted, the confidence finally returning to him. &quot;You brat...&quot;  the Magician cried under his breath. &quot;Now... Now tell us the spell to change us back or... Or we&#39;ll make you a little baby!&quot; &quot;Okay, okay!&quot; the Magician said as he slowly raised his hands. &quot;I must admit, I underestimated your resolve. I thought for sure I broke you at the very least. &quot;I... I don&#39;t give a shit! Tell us!&quot; &quot;Okay... The spell to change you back is... Levitatus!&quot; It happened so suddenly. Dan and Mike felt like they were knocked back, but they never hit the pavement. Instead, they found themselves floating in the air again. &quot;No!&quot; was all Dan could let out. &quot;It seems I was right to use that wand.&quot; &quot;No! Don&#39;t tell me!&quot; &quot;Quick on the uptake for an 11 year old, aren&#39;t we?&quot; &quot;Whoa!&quot; Dan was moved towards the Magician upside down as he grabbed his face by the nose, shook it back and forth and then slapped him. &quot;The wand is simply just for show. The real magic is within. If only you believed in magic, you would&#39;ve realized that.&quot; &quot;Noooooo! I&#39;m so sorry. Daddy tried to stop me, but I didn&#39;t listen!&quot; Mike pleaded as his confidence withered again. &quot;Mike! How could you?!&quot; Dan kept his end of what he told Mike and was prepared to take the Magician&#39;s punishment. &quot;First off, all this person is your big brother, not your daddy!&quot; the Magician shouted as he pulled Mike towards him, ripped the wand from his hand and gave him a good slap. &quot;Guh!&quot; Second of all, you aren&#39;t fooling anyone. I know your little five year old pea brain couldn&#39;t have thought of this. You must think I&#39;m stupid&quot; &quot;No... No... He didn&#39;t... Guh!&quot; Mike tried to plea with him, but the Magician simply slapped him again. &quot;Wait! Please don&#39;t! It really was his idea! I swear!&quot; Dan started to sweat as the Magician aimed his sights at Mike. The Magician paid him no heed though. &quot;I believe I told you what would happen, did I not?&quot; &quot;No! Stop! I don&#39;t wanna!&quot; Mike was reduced to tears again. &quot;Michael!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s such a shame, you two were really so close. I could never have foreseen HOW close.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Magician started speaking nonsense as he moved Dan and Mike around. Mike was then placed eye level to Dan&#39;s tiny penis. Before he could even register what was happening, Dan moved forward. Mike&#39;s mouth was forced open as he took Dan&#39;s prick into his mouth. &quot;Mmmpppphhh?!&quot; &quot;What... the fuck?&quot; Dan couldn&#39;t believe his eyes at first, but his own son was indeed giving him head. &quot;Jesus Christmas!&quot; &quot;Bowelus Loosus!&quot; The Magician shook his wand as Dan felt his bladder loosen as he started to pee into Mike&#39;s mouth. &quot;Mmmmppphhh! Mmmmmgggghhhh!&quot; &quot;Oh my god! Oh my god!&quot; Mike took in every last drop of urine and it tasted as disgusting as it sounded. When Dan finally finished, the Magician yanked his penis out of Mike&#39;s mouth. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!&quot; Mike could only scream as he desperately spat out the remaining urine. &quot;Oh god! Jesus! You fucking pedo!&quot; Dan spat out. &quot;Now, how rude! Don&#39;t blame me for wanting to piss in your younger brother&#39;s mouth.&quot; The Magician then moved Dan down and into Mike&#39;s pelvis, taking his even smaller penis in. &quot;Ahh! Daddy, no!&quot; &quot;Mmmpphhh. Slurp! Mmmpphhh!&quot; Dan was forced to roll his tongue around his son&#39;s penis. He was too young to get erect, but that hardly seemed to matter. &quot;Ahh! Daddy!&quot; &quot;For the last time, he is your big brother! &quot;Bowelus Loosus!&quot; Dan prepared to feel Mike pee into his mouth, but Mike simply started to shit himself again. He was completely overwhelmed by the assault on his lower body. &quot;Nooooo!&quot; &quot;This will stop when you listen to what I&#39;m saying. Good little boys listen to what adults tell them. &quot;Ahh... Ahh... Big Brother... Please stop, Danny!&quot; &quot;Now that wasn&#39;t so hard, now was it?&quot; the Magician said as Dan was pulled back by the hair. &quot;Now what about you young man. What do you say to your little brother?&quot; &quot;Ahh! Gah! You fucker!&quot; &quot;It seems like your big brother wants to do more bad things to you,&quot; the Magician said as he looked towards Mike again. &quot;Noooooo!&quot; was all Mike could say as he recoiled. &quot;Ahh... Goddammit!&quot; &quot;Now is that anyway for a child your age to act?&quot; &quot;Guh... I&#39;m sorry... little brother... I didn&#39;t mean to scare you, Mikey...&quot; &quot;Good good. Its nice to see brothers make up after terrible misunderstandings. Cleanus!&quot; <br />
<br />
Every thing was then cleaned up again. Even, the leftover taste of urine faded from Mike&#39;s mouth. The two moved back to each other and were forced into another embrace. &quot;Guh...Ugh... Sniff!&quot; Mike could only sob as his father... no, his big brother Dan consoled him, tears also streaming down his face. The Magician kept them in that position for the remainder of the trip. Their bodies pressed up against each other was a constant reminder of who they were now. After about twenty more minutes, they finally stopped. &quot;And here we are!&quot; the Magician simply said as the two brother&#39;s were ripped from their embrace. They were turned around and then saw where they were.</p>
