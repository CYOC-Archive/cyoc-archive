<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty laughed gleefully as he turned Dustin into a piglet, then watched him trot robotically down the stairs to go out and roll in the sty and generally debase himself.<br />
<br />
He then went to his stepmother's room, opened the door, and wished her into a big fat sow.  &quot;Haha!&quot; Ty cried.  &quot;Now Mark has some pig pussy!&quot;<br />
<br />
June squealed, trotting out the door and down the stairs to be forced to roll in mud and copulate according to Ty's wishes.<br />
<br />
*AHEM* said a voice behind Tyler.<br />
<br />
Ty turned and looked at a robed skeleton holding a scythe.<br />
<br />
*I'M SORRY* said the figure.  *YOU ARE DEAD.  I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE YOUR SOUL TO THE APPROPRIATE AFTERLIFE, BUT FIRST THERE IS A MATTER OF MAGICAL INHERITANCE.  HAVE YOU SIRED ANY HEIRS?*<br />
<br />
&quot;Heirs?&quot; gasped Ty.  &quot;I don't have any heirs!  I'm gay!&quot;<br />
<br />
*MANY GAY INDIVIDUALS HAVE HEIRS* the figure pointed out.  *IN ANY CASE, YOUR MAGICAL INHERITANCE IS YOURS FROM YOUR FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY UNTIL YOUR DEATH.  YOU'VE JUST DIED, AND WHILE REINCARNATION IS GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE, WE CAN'T JUST HAVE PEOPLE REINCARNATED IN THE SAME BODY.  CONFUSES PEOPLE.  THOUGH AS YOU DIED WITHOUT ISSUE, AND APARENTLY WERE THE LAST OF YOUR LINE, WHO DID YOU LOVE MOST?*<br />
<br />
It was freaking Ty out how the Reaper kept talking about him in the past tense, but he was scared.  &quot;Uh, Landon I guess.&quot;  Ty grimaced.  &quot;Guy at school.  He doesn't know.  I've just always had a secret crush on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
*VERY WELL* said the Reaper.  *THE USES OF YOUR POWER SINCE YOUR DEATH ARE OF COURSE NULLIFIED, BUT THE ONES FROM BEFORE STAND.*<br />
<br />
Ty collapsed into a pile of E Coli and pigshit, then his soul separated out while something...something else magical...formed into a star and went streaking off through the ether.<br />
<br />
*NOW* said the Reaper *I'M BEING CONSIDERABLY KINDER THAN I RIGHTFULLY SHOULD, BUT LUCKILY FOR YOU, THERE IS SUCH A THING AS POETIC JUSTICE, AND WE HAVE FOUR UNAUTHORIZED USES OF MAGICAL POWER TO ACCOUNT FOR: REBIRTH, MIND CONTROL, TRANSFORMATION TO PIGLET AND TRANSFORMATION TO SOW.  AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT SO THAT THE INHERITANCE OF YOUR MAGICAL POWER IS PROPERLY TRANSFERRED.  LUCKILY YOU HAVE CHOSEN AN APPROPRIATE VESSEL, AS YOU SHALL SEE....*<br />
<br />
The Reaper grabbed Ty's soul, leading it out through the wall where June and Dustin were standing in human form in a sty with Mark the Boar and then flying across the city through the wall of an ordinary house and into the bedroom of Landon.<br />
<br />
Landon was tall, handsome, and totally naked, standing in the middle of a pentacle made in duct tape on the carpet.  He was also glowing with power, but even so looked rather surprised when the Reaper stepped through the wall.<br />
<br />
*CONGRATULATIONS, YOUNG WARLOCK* the Reaper intoned.  *YOUR PLEAS TO THE POWERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED, IN A RATHER SPECTACULAR FASHION.  YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO TRANSFORM YOURSELF OR ANYONE INTO ANYTHING YOU PLEASE, MERELY AT A WHIM.  THOUGH WITH THIS POWER COMES A SMALL RESPONSIBILITY.  BEHOLD: YOUR NEW FAMILIAR!*<br />
<br />
Ty suddenly felt himself no longer dead.  He was also looking at a pair of feet, standing on a duct-tape pentacle, and then he looked up at the handsome but huge expanse of Landon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get a pot-bellied pig as a familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
*YES* said the Reaper.  *HER NAME IS TYRA.*<br />
<br />
Ty squealed, realizing with horror what was happening as his will was suddenly magically enslaved to Landon just as Mark's had been to his.<br />
<br />
*SHE IS YOUR SLAVE IN ALL THINGS, AND SO LONG AS YOU KEEP HER, THE MAGICAL POWER IS YOURS.  YOU MAY TRANSFORM YOURSELF OR ANYONE ELSE HOWEVER OR WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT.  THE ONLY THING YOU MAY NOT TRANSFORM IS YOUR FAMILIAR, TYRA, WHO MUST REMAIN IN THIS FORM FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Kewl!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Reaper nodded solemnly then stepped out through the wall, leaving Ty there staring up at Landon, her new Master.<br />
<br />
Landon looked at Ty, then looked down at himself, then said aloud, &quot;I wish my dick was twelve inches long.&quot;<br />
<br />
At once, his penis began to grow, getting longer and longer until at last it stopped at twelve inches.  Soft.<br />
<br />
Landon took his freakish organ in one hand and examined it.  &quot;Uh, I meant 'hard' but still, this is sweet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty tried to say something, but all that came out of her mouth was a squeal.<br />
<br />
Landon giggled.  &quot;I wish I were really buff.&quot;<br />
<br />
At once, his muscles started inflating until at last he stood there looking like an extremely hung teenage atlas. &quot;Sweet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty squealed again.  Landon had gotten his power!<br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door.  &quot;Landon, what's going on in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, just getting dressed, mom!&quot; Landon said quickly, grabbing on a T-shirt and pulling it down over his massive chest, then pulling on a pair of jeans which were too tight in both the thighs and the crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I weren't quite so buff,&quot; Landon whispered softly, his muscles shrinking from teen bodybuilder to a swimmer's build and all of his clothes fitting much better except for the enormous bulge in his crotch.  &quot;Uh, sure,&quot; Landon said.<br />
<br />
The door opened and his mom stepped in, a hot woman with shoulder-length brown hair, though all that Ty could see beyond that were her enormous breasts.  She didn't even glance at the pentagram, but she looked straight at Ty.  &quot;Where did you get the pig?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bought her for me for my birthday,&quot; Landon replied quickly.  &quot;Her name's Tyra.  I wish you'd remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Landon's mom shook her head, causing her breasts to shimmy, then said, &quot;Oh yes.  Tyra.  You said she'd be a perfect familiar for your new witchcraft thing.&quot;  Landon's mom looked very serious then.  &quot;However, as supportive as I can be of your personal religious choices, Landon, remember that an animal is an animal, and poor Tyra here doesn't look very happy.  If you're done with whatever ritual you were doing--and don't tell me you weren't, because I can smell the incense--I want you to go get her leash and take her for a walk.&quot;  Her eyes then looked to Landon's crotch and the enormous bulge there.  &quot;And for God's sake, don't pad your crotch, Landon.  No one's going to believe it and the girls will laugh at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not padding,&quot; Landon said.<br />
<br />
His mom raised her eyebrows, then looked closer, then raised her eyebrows again.  &quot;Oh...&quot;  She turned red in the face.  &quot;I just...&quot;  She paused.  &quot;You've been working out, haven't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, those pants aren't anywhere near as loose as they were when I bought them, and that's making, uh, things show more than they should.  Here,&quot; she reached into her pocket and pulled out a few twenties.  &quot;Take these to the mall and get yourself some baggier jeans.  Take Tyra with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks mom,&quot; Landon said, accepting the cash.  &quot;Heel, Tyra,&quot; Landon added, and Ty felt herself trotting over to stand at Landon's heel, exactly like a faithful dog.  Or faithful potbellied pig familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got her well trained, I see,&quot; Landon's mother said approvingly as Landon led Tyra out of the house and off to the mall.</p>
