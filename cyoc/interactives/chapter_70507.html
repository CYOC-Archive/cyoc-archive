<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide there's no harm in taking a bite, smell accounts for over 50% of taste after all. Besides, kids try dog food everyday, and they're all fine. They're also good for your teeth.<br />
<br />
You take a small bite of the dog treat, it really does taste as good as it smells, you chew slowly, savoring the flavor. You take another bite, bigger this time, as you chew you feel your teeth begin to tingle. You're impressed the dental part of the bone works so well. By the time you're done chewing, your teeth feel great, in fact, running your tongue over them finds they've even sharpened up a little bit. Just those two bites has really made you feel good.<br />
<br />
You crumple up the rest of the treat, making sure to leave some evidence, after all, the whole point of this was to show her your sense of humor. You're about to walk away when you smell them again, crumpling that last bit of the treat really made the smell carry. You go back over and reach in the box, pulling out the treat. This time you eat it whole, enjoying the taste, the texture, and the feeling it gives you.<br />
<br />
You're about to reach back in when you notice your hands covered in crumbs, without thinking you absent-mindedly lick your fingers, like someone licks off the crumbs from potato chips. As you reach in the box your hands gets a cramping feeling, making it hard to move your fingers, by the time it hits a treat, you can't even grab it. Panicked, you try to yank your hand out of the box to see what's the matter, as you do so, the box falls down. You try to catch it, but now your other hand feels cramped as well. The box hits the floor and sends treats on the ground around it.<br />
<br />
You look at your hands, something has made your fingers shrink, and little black marks are appearing on your palms. You decide you need to call someone for help, you run out of the kitchen and race for the phone. You try to pick up the receiver, but your stubby fingers just knock it to the ground. You let out an audible whine. You're about to try again when you smell the treats. You apprehensively go back to the spilled box. Well, you can't use the phone anyway, why not have a snack while you wait for Kelly to get home?<br />
<br />
You get down to the floor and get on all fours, you know you can't pick up the treats, so how are you going to eat them? You look around for ideas, your kitchen drawer is within reach but you don't think you can use utensils. You look at your hands again, things have gotten worse. Your fingers are just tiny stubs, your thumb is no where to be seen, and rough, black pads have formed underneath them, and on your palm. You decide to ignore this and move on.<br />
<br />
You see the box next. You study it for a moment, hoping for inspiration. You notice the dog on the front, it's panting. That's it! You'll use your tongue! That's how these things are designed anyway.<br />
<br />
Bracing yourself on your front paws, wait, don't you mean hands? You brace yourself with your hands and bring your face right up to a treat. You carefully roll out your tongue and try to pick up the treat, to your surprise it works. You have a few treats, feeling your tongue get longer and more precise each time. Pretty soon the floor is just covered in crumbs. You put your tongue to work and clean them up, taking big long strokes with your flat tongue. You begin to sniff the air, you've eaten all the treats, but you still smell them, using your long tongue, you lick your nose, hoping that will help it out, you're taken aback when it feels rough, and already slimy. You blame that on the messy eating you've been doing.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, you know where they are, you look over and see the box, there must still be some in there. You pin your face up to the top opening, you see it, the glorious treat sitting at the bottom. You clumsily move your paw to the other end of the box, holding it in place as you try to force in your tongue, even with it's new length however, it's just not long enough. You're about to give up when you feel something happen with your face, your nose and mouth are pushing slowly outward, getting deeper and further into the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is perfect!&quot; You think happily. You can now reach the last treat, you happily take it in your mouth and pull your muzzle out of the box. You feel so happy, like everything is perfect just sitting on the floor with your treats. You roll your tongue out of your mouth and pant with content. You try to sit back but something's bulging at the back of your pants, in fact, all of your clothes feel oddly restrictive, you want out of them. You start pulling of your shirt and pants with your paws and after about a minute, you succeed in getting them off.<br />
<br />
You look down at your legs, they're beginning to change shape, just like your hands were, they begin to tingle all over as a healthy coat of tan fur comes in. For some reason the fur makes you happy, this feeling makes your ass start to shake, you look behind you to see a long, tan-furred tail happily wagging away. &quot;This is awesome!&quot; You think.<br />
<br />
Your feet now feel weird though, somehow you're able to twist your body the right way to bring them right up to your face, something feels odd about them. You decide to investigate with your most useful appendage, your mouth, you start licking at your feet, and as you do so, you feel the fur, the pads and the claws all come in simultaneously. You pull your face away just in time to see them change into a paw shape, matching your hands.<br />
<br />
You stand up on all fours and look over your whole body, you're now completely covered in tan fur, your chest has changed shape, you hips have changed angles and your knees now accommodate four-legged movement. Looking at your body has given you a massive erection, you look at your still-human member and decide it needs a good licking. You lay back down and take it in your muzzle, moving your mouth slowly back and forth, kneading it with your flat tongue. You feel a bulge form, you know it's your knot, you try to take it in as well, nearly gagging yourself with your own member. You feel it become smoother, your head's shape changing more to match your doggy form. You go faster and faster until you finally erupt, sending seed flowing down your throat. You take it out of your mouth, you're now completely a dog. What next?</p>
