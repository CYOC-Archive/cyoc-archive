<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike and Tony&#39;s friendship continued to grow both emotionally and sexually through out the rest of the year. At the start of their second year they were a couple, however the two didn&#39;t get to see each other much as they had both taken part time on campus jobs. There was also another strain on their bond, an unspoken elephant in the room and a dark cloud lingering over their relationship.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why on earth would you want to destroy the Chronivac?&quot; Mikey puzzled incredulously<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why I still hold on to it&quot; replied Tony &quot;I haven&#39;t used it in for over a year&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t destroy it Tony,&quot; retorted Mikey &quot;We might need it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like what it does to me Mikey,&quot; argued Tony &quot;Sometimes when a customer pisses me off at the coffee shop, I imagine shrinking them and dunking them in their latte or turning them into shrubs and pissing on them or just transforming them them into slugs and stepping...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? everyone thinks that way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they can&#39;t all do it! It&#39;s the same reason I&#39;m against people owning guns. What if one day I snap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if we ever want to change ourselves back?!&quot; exclaimed Mikey<br />
<br />
There was a pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what this is about?&quot; Tony clipped &quot;You want your big fat cock back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say that-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you were thinking it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wouldn&#39;t mind it, sometimes I miss the attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you&#39;re with me? Because you&#39;re just waiting for me to turn your dick back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; gasped Mikey &quot;How could you say that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t a no,&quot; retorted Tony &quot;Is this why you didn&#39;t want us to tell anyone about our relationship last summer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t want anyone back home to know your dick wasn&#39;t big!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats not it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, I don&#39;t want to talk about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... we&#39;re not arguing about that! We&#39;re arguing about the Chronivac!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! If you want your cock back so bad then you can have it!&quot; Tony opened his wallet, took out a small card and threw it at Mikey &quot;That&#39;s the password! I don&#39;t want to see you or that thing here when I get back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony stormed off slamming the door behind him.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Tony stayed with a friend for a few days. He was a nice guy but no one could room with him for very long because of his BO. Coincidentally he was one of the guys who Tony had nearly brainwashed into punishing Mike on his first night on campus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t you just go talk to him?&quot; asked the heavy set guy, lying in bed<br />
<br />
&quot;I said some pretty stupid things&quot; explained Tony, swinging on a swivel chair<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; he challenged, between handfuls of chips<br />
<br />
&quot;And awful things&quot; Tony confessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then say your sorry&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;d even want to talk to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you won&#39;t know unless you go back&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if he really was using me?&quot; Tony worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would Mike do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so, I don&#39;t know what to think&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look go over and see how Mike feels at least, then figure out what to do next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...&quot; Tony conceded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can&#39;t stay here forever&quot; his friend mentioned sagely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Why not?&quot; Tony challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because at some point I&#39;m going to have to stop holding in my farts&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You&#39;ve been holding them in? What is that god awful stench then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My natural musk.&quot; his friend grinned &quot;Actually the pressures been building too long, when it drops it&#39;s gonna be a big, I don&#39;t think I can hold it in much longer&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK OK&quot; Tony rushed.<br />
<br />
He sprang out the door as his friend wailed behind him &quot;RUUUUN! SAAAAVE YOURSELF!&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Mike was lying in bed when he heard a light knock at the door<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in&quot;<br />
<br />
The door eased open and Tony stuck his head through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh hi&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey jumped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony! Where&#39;ve you been?&quot; he walked forward but halted as Tony came in &quot;God you reek, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve been staying with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Tony lingered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think you wanted to avoid me that badly...&quot; marveled Mikey.<br />
<br />
Tony shut the door behind him. There was a brief silence as they looked into each others eyes. Mikey pulled down his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you doing Mikey?&quot; spluttered Tony<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted you to know I didn&#39;t use it&quot; blurted Mikey.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you couldn&#39;t have just told me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wanted you to see for yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey bent over and pulled his pants back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about what I said before&quot; Tony started.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I should&#39;ve...Why were you away so long?&quot; Mikey questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...I felt stupid...and wrong...and&quot; Tony admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t afraid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; Mikey deflected &quot;Never mind&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Tony objected &quot;I know you&#39;ve been dwelling on this, tell me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was worried,&quot; Mikey conceded &quot;Worried maybe you didn&#39;t come back sooner because you were afraid I&#39;d use the Chronivac against you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, The thought never crossed my mind.&quot; Tony puzzled &quot;I mean I can imagine you wanting and having your big cock back again, but I couldn&#39;t imagine you doing anything to hurt me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Mikey sighed &quot;Even after everything in high-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Tony interupted &quot;I guess I see you and my high school bully as two completely different people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re- I&#39;m not,&quot; Mikey said &quot;I still think about it sometimes, whenever someone annoys me and I just want to punch their lights out and I worry I haven&#39;t changed at all or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? everyone thinks that way&quot; quoted Tony with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh har har, I thought I was the funny one&quot; Mikey deadpanned.<br />
<br />
&quot;People get angry,&quot; Tony comforted him, &quot;You can&#39;t berate yourself for feeling emotion, besides, you haven&#39;t smashed anyone since we came here...except on the football field...don&#39;t feel guilty for something you haven&#39;t even done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m glad at least you trust me&quot; Mikey said<br />
<br />
&quot;At least me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well It&#39;s just... over summer... I didn&#39;t know how to explain to everyone back home that we were different than the way we were. I was worried everyone back home would think I was bullying you, or blackmailing you into being with me&quot; Mikey explained &quot;I didn&#39;t want people to think I was still some kind of abusive monster. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to tell anyone&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it was selfish...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s a good reason...we&#39;ll make sure, everyone understands us before we tell them...&quot; Tony trailed off &quot;I&#39;m gonna go take a shower. Are we... ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a testament to how much Mikey was willing to suffer that he stepped up despite the odors coming off Tony&#39;s clothes and wrapped him in a big hug<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I missed you too&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Tony came back after a refreshing shower to find Mikey sitting on his bed with the Chronivac on his desk. Tony eyed it carefully but waited for Mikey to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony...I don&#39;t think that we should get rid of the Chronivac...&quot; Mikey started &quot;...but it&#39;s your device, and if you want it destroyed, I&#39;ll support you all the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony released his breath, &quot;Thank you Mikey&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But please...there&#39;s one thing I want to use it for before we lose it forever.&quot; Mikey said<br />
<br />
Tony tensed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing permanent,&quot; Mikey reassured quickly &quot;no mind manipulation, it&#39;s just something I really need to do, at least once in my life&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony sighed &quot;Okay what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey smiled &quot;Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes I trust you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony shut his eyes while Mikey played with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I recognized the password immediately...&quot; commented Mikey as he fiddled through menus. &quot;It was the date of both the worst, and best day of my life. Our first day here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey found what he wanted and hit apply<br />
<br />
Tony felt the old tingling of change in his groin. He was briefly worried but it was soon followed by a shock of pleasure as a gentle finger began to caress his flesh.<br />
<br />
He looked down and Mikey was slowly caressing his penis. Not the average penis the Chronivac had given him. His original, 2.8 inch penis. Sensations he hadn&#39;t felt in a year rushed through his body. He had forgotten sensitive his original penis was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Tony...&quot; commented Mikey &quot;All of you, I&#39;m sorry I was never able to realize how beautiful your penis was before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not... it&#39;s so small...&quot; shuddered Tony. &quot;You&#39;re messing with me right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Never. It&#39;s perfect in every way&quot; insisted Mikey kissing the tip to lick up the droplet of precum that had formed &quot;because it&#39;s yours, I just wanted to really appreciate your real penis at least once&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey then proceeded to envelop Tony&#39;s entire cock and balls into his eager mouth. He was able to twirl the entire shaft around his tongue sending waves of ecstasy through his body.<br />
<br />
As much as they both wanted it to last, it wasn&#39;t long before Tony&#39;s breathing began to quicken<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh Mikey....&quot; he moaned before sending volley after volley of thick sweet semen into his friend&#39;s eager mouth. He swallowed every drop.<br />
<br />
Mikey smiled and stood up to kiss Tony on the lips.<br />
<br />
As they slowly pulled away Mikey picked up and turned on the Chronivac again, but Tony told him to wait and gently pulled it out of his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to change you back too&quot; Tony said fiddling with the controls.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could protest again, Tony hit apply, Mikey&#39;s hard cock lost some of it&#39;s rigidity as it grew into a semi hard 7.5 inch penis<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? After all the trouble my cock has put us through?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; Tony assured him &quot;It might be the same cock, but it belonged to someone else before&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony reached down and stroked Mikey&#39;s penis causing it to grow to it&#39;s full 9.1 inches. Shortly after Tony went to work licking up and down Mikey&#39;s immense shaft and started to suck on the end. Despite having just ejaculated minutes earlier, Tony was hard again. Tony pushed as much as he could down his throat slowly but couldn&#39;t get far past 7 inches. He started to gag and Mikey gently pushed him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to force yourself&quot; he cautioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just I always liked this penis, even if I didn&#39;t always like the guy it was attached to. I&#39;d always wonder what it would be like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey didn&#39;t know what to make of that. Instead he remarked on how Tony was erect again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yea, don&#39;t worry&quot; Tony suggested &quot;I already had my go...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey stepped around Tony and sat on his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Please. I love playing with your tiny-&quot; Mikey stopped abruptly &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony smiled and sat next to Mikey so they were side by side like they were during their first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, it&#39;s small, you can mention it&quot; Tony assured him<br />
<br />
Mikey hesitated but continued &quot;I love playing with your handsome little dick&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony&#39;s dick gave a twitch, and Mikey reached over to hold it gently between his thumb and forefinger. Tony crossed his arm over to grab onto Mikey&#39;s large throbbing cock. Mikey played with Tony&#39;s dick using quick light tugs while Tony made long grand strokes up and down Mikey&#39;s cock. After a few minutes of this Tony groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;...mmm yea fuck me...&quot; Tony moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;ooh yea thats it&quot; Mikey continued<br />
<br />
&quot;No...FUCK me&quot; Tony emphasized, standing up and making his way in front of Mikey before slowly lowering his ass and spreading his cheeks. They had both fucked each other with their average penises before but Tony had never taken a cock this big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! Hold up&quot; Mikey said before quickly reaching for a tube of lube and squirting a wad onto his cock just in time, before the lust mad Tony made contact and began lowering himself past the tip. Not use to a cock so thick, he slowly eased his way down Mikey&#39;s pole. Tony couldn&#39;t take all of Mikey&#39;s length but made it a fair way before starting to slide up and down. Mikey supported Tony&#39;s weight so he wouldn&#39;t slip and impale himself while also slowly thrusting in and out in time with Tony&#39;s rhythm. As Mikey&#39;s cock gradually buried itself deeper into Tony&#39;s ass his small penis began to leak. Tony moved his fingers down to play with his tiny cock but Mikey reached around and batted his hand away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t get to keep your beautiful little cock all to yourself&quot; he claimed, and lovingly stroked Tony&#39;s tiny dick.<br />
<br />
Tony groaned and continued to bounce up and down on Mikey&#39;s fuck stick, soon he was almost taking it&#39;s full length. Tony and Mikey both felt their orgasms building, the intensity of their thrusting reached it&#39;s peak and Mikey let out a euphoric cry as he plunged the remainder of Mikey&#39;s cock balls deep and released a spray of cum that flew across the room. His sphincter tightened and Mikey groaned. He thrusted twice more before pumping round after round of semen deep into Tony&#39;s rectum. Meanwhile Tony&#39;s micropenis was still shooting violent burst of cum in the most intense orgasm of his life. Both their explosive ejaculations gradually died down and Tony slid off Mikey&#39;s dick. With exhausted breath the two fell asleep in each others arms.</p>
