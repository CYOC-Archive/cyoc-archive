<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer waddled to the door, and pulled it open. Poking her head out of her bedroom she was met with nothing but the faded lightbulb illuminating the shadowed hallway. Jennifer tried to be sneaky, she remembered those old cartoons with the people using their tippi toes to sneak easier, they were fat liars. Her increased weight was betrayed as it felt like each step caused the warped floorboards to squeak and groan, or maybe that was just her moms moaning. Her belly severely hampered her agility as she continued to try to sneak closer to her mom&#39;s room. The moans and thudding grew ever more louder and pronounced. In the back of her mind Jennifer started to wonder if she was even doing this for the curse, or if she was just so desperately curious to see it. Her excitement only hastened her steps until she reached the door. It felt like a monument, a threshold to the unknown. With a vile grin Jennifer pulled the lock and swung open the door.<br />
<br />
The sight she beheld was startling, her mom clad in her birthday suit was straddling the man on the bed, each thrust causing her to buckle as she moaned loudly, even more so as the sound rang out into the hallway. Silvia looked up in a pant as she saw Jennifer. &quot;Jennifer go to bed! NOW!&quot; She pointed to the door as she yelled. The man turned his head around to look at Jennifer, she felt mortified. &quot;Is that your ki-&quot; Silvia cut him off with a pelvic thrust of her own causing him to grunt. &quot;Now Jennifer.&quot; Jennifer snapped out of her shock as she quickly shut the door and waddled as fast as she could to her room. <br />
<br />
Jennifer laid there on her mattress, the images flashing through her mind, the mental image of herself older imprinted on the scene. She cooed as she buried her face in her pillow, damn the smell she was too excited. It was hard for her to calm down enough to get to sleep. Jennifer knew she had too or her mom would be yelling at her as soon as she was done, but that wouldn&#39;t be her problem now as she faded into a dream.<br />
<br />
Jennifer woke up with a unfamiliar feeling, she felt like she wanted to throw up. She looked around the darkened early morning room to find little to calm her nerves. The room had severely degraded in quality, it felt as if the whole house had changed. She looked down at herself. For once, just once, her stomach had shrunken considerably. Yes! That was the little glimmer of hope she needed as she got out of her bed. Looking over the room the tell tale makings of her future situation were scattered, clothing and junk piled haphazardly. Toys were popping out of the piles as if buried by a cloth avalanche. Jennifer walked out her room into the bathroom, a metric ton of makeup and other products littered the sink counter. Jennifer was able to get a good look at herself too. She was certainly crossing the threshold of being a tween. If she actually combed her hair and had any amount of clean clothes she could almost recognize her kid self.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared down at her stomach, it was still there, somehow, but given how she was feeling she could guess it had regressed too. &quot;Thank god.&quot; Jennifer whispered, she didn&#39;t know if she could have handled moving at all if it had stayed. Jennifer heard a bang on the bathroom door as it swung open, Silvia shambling in almost not noticing Jennifer. Jennifer got a good look at her mom again, this time around she had still gotten younger, which concerned her greatly. How long would it be until she was Jennifer&#39;s original age? What was worse was what she was wearing. If Jennifer thought wearing no top was degrading her mom walking in completely nude was something else entirely. Jennifer was nearly eye level with her moms vagina, and it was closing in fast. Jennifer yelped as Silvia thankfully took a step back. &quot;Oh baby you scared me, why are you in here? It&#39;s still morning muffin.&quot; Jennifer waved it off &quot;Sorry I was just using the bathroom.&quot; she lied. &quot;I was just going back to my room.&quot; Silvia chuckled slightly, &quot;Ok baby, you get some more sleep ok?&quot; She moved in to hug Jennifer even though she tried to dodge it. Silvia squeezed her daughter as Jennifer&#39;s face was mere inches from her pussy. Jennifer cringed as she could smell the raw sex that must have transpired. Wait, why did she know what that smelled like anyways? Jennifer was pulled aside as her mom with no inhibitions or sense of dignity herself plopped down on the toilet, only to look back to her daughter puzzled. &quot;What? Did you also want to see your mom take a piss too? Go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer retreated back to her room, taking stock of her surroundings. She looked worried as it seemed that with the piles receding, so was her choice of apparel, and it seemed based on her mom&#39;s choice of attire this morning that the family didn&#39;t care too much for them at all now.</p>
