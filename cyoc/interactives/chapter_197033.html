<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff backed away from the computer and quickly removed his clothes while he still could. And now that he was naked, he could see his transformation beginning. <br />
<br />
It started with his fingers of all places, each one of them had their nail darken and become more canine in appearance by taking on a much more curved shape. Jeff then watched as his hands began to deform. His palms lengthened considerably while his fingers shrunk down to small stubs. His thumbs actually moved much further back towards his wrists as the inside of his palms and fingertips became covered in rough pads.   <br />
<br />
With his hands becoming paws right before his eyes, Jeff began to feel anxious a bit, hoping this would all work out well enough. He hadn&#39;t directly made himself his dog&#39;s mate now that he thought about it, so hopefully he will still find her attractive enough. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s paws now we&#39;re slowly being covered in dog hair as the process moved up her arms, making them much more canine as it went. She was so engrossed in watching this that she hadn&#39;t realized that she now was thinking of herself as being female as if it was natural for her to do so. The changes on her arms continued upwards until they reached a few inches just short of hitting her shoulders. Then spread more throughout her body.<br />
<br />
Jeff squatted down, knowing eventually this would become her normal sitting posture, and placed her paws on the floor between her knees. She felt her tongue alter inside of her mouth, and the heightening of some of her senses, while her ability to taste had simplified quite a bit instead.<br />
<br />
As the changes moved downwards, she would grow a new pair of nipples the closer it got to her waist, until her front was lined with 8 smallish sized breasts, with her top most pair being significantly larger than the bottom 3 rows by about 2-3 times.<br />
<br />
When it finally reached her waist, she heard a bone chilling snap. Her pelvis had been painlessly broken and now was shifting itself into the proper shape and position to not only exclusivly support a quadrupedal form, but to also allow more room for her to carry several fetuses inside her new bicornuate uterus. <br />
<br />
Her new hip bone forced Jeff to lean forwards a bit more. She turned her head around to look behind her and watched her own spine push a lump out from just above her ass crack. That lump lengthened out into her new tail and quickly became coated in long fur. <br />
<br />
Beneath her new tail, Jeff could feel her crotch modifying itself and moved her focus to between her legs just in time to see the last inch of her dick pull back inside of her, followed by her testicles which she felt move down through her 2 womb horns into their proper place as her ovaries. <br />
<br />
Her former ball sack painlessly split open and formed into the vulva of her new bitch pussy. A pair of anal scent glands appeared in her crotch as well. With her reproductive system fully now that of a pure bred border collie bitch, Jeff is already looking forward to being mounted once again. Even her tail starts wagging at the thought of her dogs dick sliding inside of her.<br />
<br />
The final changes happen as the transformation reaches her thighs. Dog fur covers them as they reshape. Her feet stretch and similar claw like nails replace her toe nails as her feet become padded, finishing her transformation.<br />
<br />
Once again, the house reshapes itself to be the same as before, only with a small bit of discrepancies where some of her human needs no longer applied. For example, she no longer had a special spot in the bathroom for her. She now had to go outside like any other dog. Her room was now the &quot;dogs&#39; room&quot; with the word dogs being plural. But that did come with a larger dog bed for two dogs to easily share. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt the return of her collar and upon looking at it in a newly placed mirror she found near the floor in the room, she discovered her name had changed. At least, according to her official dog tag. Now her name was Cina. This name would have been her name if she had been born a girl, according to her Mom at least. So now that she actually had been in this altered version of reality, it only made sense.<br />
<br />
Cina stood up and noticed right away that standing on 4 paws instead of stumps was much more comfortable. That said, walking was much more complicated with so many different joints now needing to be synchronized with each other. But in a matter of just a few minutes, she was more or less use to it. <br />
<br />
One thing Cina didn&#39;t think of, was making her neck longer. It was just a bit inconvenient to have to lower herself down to sniff things closer to the ground, but it wasn&#39;t concerning enough to use the safe word. Her food and water bowl could always be raised up off the ground on a stool or something if they needed to be. <br />
<br />
Cina padded her way out of the room through the doggy door and ran out of the house and into her backyard. Feeling the warm sun on her naked body was quite refreshing. And the myriad of new smells was very stimulating. She spent a good while sniffing around, though in doing so she practically was dragging her large front breasts across the yard in the process. Thankfully they were quite more durable and didn&#39;t even get hurt or damaged in the slightest. Though they were a bit dirtier now.<br />
<br />
As she continued to move around her yard, she suddenly had the urge to pee, and felt her body squatting down instinctively. She had never peed outside before, and now she was not only doing it, but while fully naked too. It took a little bit, but she soon finished and decided to go find her dog. <br />
<br />
Not only that, but while she ran back inside, she managed to come across her Mom, who greeted her with a &quot;Good morning&quot; and a head pat. Then her mom went to fill the food and water bowls for her dogs. Since Cina knew what was going on, she simply stayed in the kitchen and waited patiently for her own bowl to be filled. <br />
<br />
Cina was a bit surprised to watch her Mom fill her bowl up with the same dog food that the other dog would be eating. But then a few bits of freshly cooked bacon were added into her bowl and she no longer minded as much. That was when her fellow bowl licker found his way into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
With her current body, Cina for the first time realized just how tall her dog really was. That or how short she now is. But the male dog definitely had her beat for height. Something she actually found to be quite attractive. <br />
<br />
Her Mom set down her bowl onto a step stool first and called her over. It was a bit degrading being treated as if she were just another dog, but she didn&#39;t say anything about it either. &quot;Alright, now its your turn Luke&quot; announced her Mom as another bowl was placed next to hers, though his was just down on the floor and not the raised platform. <br />
<br />
They both began eating right away, and with her new tastebuds, she found all of it, even the dog food, to be very delicious. The bacon was still the best part though. Cina managed to eat her entire bowl full and licked her bowl clean afterwards. Luke on the other hand didn&#39;t finish his entirely so she dropped down closer to the kitchen floor and ate the rest of his breakfast for him. She knew Luke sometimes wouldn&#39;t eat everything in his bowl, so she didn&#39;t feel too bad for doing this. <br />
<br />
After cleaning out Luke&#39;s bowl as well, she laped up some water and went to continue looking for Luke. She ends up finding him in the living room, laying down on the floor while her sister watched TV. </p>
