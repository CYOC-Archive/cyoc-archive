<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the manhunt for the suspect who shot Fredrick &quot;The Shark&quot; Parker, killing a deputy in the process, continues...<br />
<br />
AT THE KNIGHT ESTATE...<br />
Being relatively alone, Amanda Knight went all out sashaying her hips and swinging her tail and rear seductively as she led her husband upstairs to bed for a wild, passionate night of sex.<br />
But the werepanthress was surprised when Benton Knight stopped in front of the door to their daughter&#39;s bedroom.<br />
&quot;Benton!&quot; hissed Amanda. &quot;We don&#39;t need to be turned on any more than we already are,&quot; she cautioned him. Coming up the stairs, she could smell the combined scent of Frieda and her lovers (a term she was still having trouble at times coping with) as the powerful aphrodisiac that drove weres mad with lust until long after their sexual needs were finally satisfied filled the air.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that dear,&quot; said Benton, as he gave a brief knock on Frieda&#39;s door. &quot;Kids,&quot; he called out. &quot;Early breakfast in the morning. I want to drop you all off at the high school early enough so I can share what my private detective found out about that math teacher.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay dad!&quot; called out Frieda, even as Benton&#39;s sharp werepanther ears heard the springs of her king size mattress continue to squeak.<br />
&quot;Come on dear. You have something else to take care of right now,&quot; announced Amanda, as she grabbed her husband by his well endowed and very hard cock to lead him to their private bedroom.<br />
As Benton growled in pleasure and willingly followed his wife, he couldn&#39;t help thinking to himself <i>Eric&#39;s right. It&#39;s only when the three of them are together, furry, and aroused. I wonder why?</i><br />
<br />
INSIDE FRIEDA&#39;S BEDROOOM...<br />
The white werepanther known as Eric Anderson continued to ram his hard, barbed penis into the black furred hybrid werewolf/cat/panthress cunt of his girlfriend Spencer Lawson from behind, even as she kept licking the red furred pussy of Frieda Knight, as the werepanthress reached underneath her lover to play with Spencer&#39;s breasts.<br />
The three of them moaned in mutual pleasure until all came simultaneously, while also experiencing the others orgasmic pleasure through the unique emphatic bond they shared.<br />
Sexually satisfied, at least for now, Eric finally was able to (reluctantly) remove his barbed cock from Spencer&#39;s hungry pussy. Then he crawled forward on the bed to lay between his women.<br />
&quot;I wonder what your dad found out about Piggy Wilson,&quot; he said, referring to the teacher that gave him grief in school today.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know, but he sounded happy about it,&quot; observed Frieda, as she cuddled on Eric&#39;s left, while Spencer laid on his right.<br />
&quot;Probably also happy that he was about to get laid too,&quot; said Spencer with a smile on her muzzle, as she kissed both her partners.<br />
&quot;If I never left this moment with the two of you, I&#39;d be extremely happy,&quot; said Eric, as both women snuggled against him.<br />
&quot;Yin, Yang, and Whole,&quot; replied Frieda happily, using her nickname for their trio, as she laid her head on Eric&#39;s furry chest while reaching out to put an arm around Spencer.<br />
&quot;Ditto,&quot; replied the hybrid were, while duplicating Frieda&#39;s actions.<br />
It was in this position, snuggled together and happily in love with each other, that the trio drifted off to sleep for the night.<br />
<br />
AT THE ANDERSONS...<br />
Despite their current activities, William and Martha Anderson <i>were</i> worried about both their children and their new hometown.<br />
But the happy werefox couple knew that while it would take time for their oldest son Nate to recover from his recently sustained injuries, he was safe at the Talbots, surrounded by a pride of werelions who would also one day be his future in-laws.<br />
Their younger son Eric was with his girlfriends at the Knight estate. Sure, Eric might still have some emotional adjustments to make, starting his Senior year when technically he should be a high school Sophomore, but he was safe in the loving arms of his girlfriends.<br />
The Andersons knew the town was doing everything it could about the Parker situation. They trusted the authorities and the powers that be, especially their next door neighbor and Mayor (Pro Tem) Samantha Twist.<br />
With everything going on, it wasn&#39;t safe for anyone to be out and about.<br />
Therefore, there was only one thing left to do.<br />
With that a foregone conclusion, the Andersons had secluded themselves within the sound proof basement of their house, built when the teenage sons of the previous owner started their own band.<br />
There the werefox made passionate love to his werevixen life/soulmate until both fell asleep in each others paws from sexual exhaustion.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;You doing all right?&quot; Brian Walker asked his girlfriend over the phone.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Patricia Monet, while looking over her shoulder at her family. &quot;Dad was late getting home because of the road blocks, but we&#39;re all safe and sound. You?&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides missing you?&quot; asked Brian, before giving Patricia a quick phone kiss, &quot;I have no word on my mom. I have no idea if she&#39;s still at her day job at the hospital, at her night job waitressing at The Local Diner, or stuck somewhere inbetween the two because of everything going on,&quot; he added, while looking at the television set display the latest news reports. The sound was low, but a high volume wasn&#39;t necessary with were hearing.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d offer to let you come over, but...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand dear,&quot; replied Brian. &quot;It isn&#39;t safe to be out and about right now. I&#39;ll just have to hold down the fort and miss you until school in the morning.&quot;<br />
&quot;No worse than I&#39;m missing my cuddly otter,&quot; said Patricia, being careful not to say too much over the phone in case some nosy reporter might be illegally eavesdropping.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go swimming again... soon,&quot; promised Brian. Then, without hesitation, he added, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; said Patricia, even as she felt herself blush in front of her family.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
WORKING LATE. STAY SAFE AND DON&#39;T WORRY. LOVE YOU. was all the text said.<br />
Joan Morning Cloud read and reread the brief message from her fiance with both joy and dread.<br />
<i>I wonder if someday he&#39;ll think about retirement. Then again, that&#39;d be like asking anyone else to stop breathing,</i> she realized, thinking about the man she loved who also happened to be the Sheriff of Moon Lake.<br />
Then Joan took a brief look at her surroundings.<br />
The cabin she shared with her mate seemed a lot emptier without him.<br />
Then she remembered the other man in her life.<br />
With that, Joan walked into the bedroom of her adopted son Darryl.<br />
A smile crossed her face as she crawled into the boy&#39;s bed and hugged him close, not wanting to be in the emptiness of the master bedroom while her man was away.<br />
Morning would find the two of them there when the alarm rang to get Darryl ready for school.<br />
It would be a while after that before she heard anything about Douglas or how his night went.<br />
<br />
<b>HE RAN.</b><br />
At the moment, it was the only thing he could do.<br />
The classic &quot;flight or fight&quot; response had chosen its option, and the man known only as Jose ran through the woods as fast as he two feet could carry him.<br />
He heard the dogs&#39; barking growing louder with each passing moment, and could just imagine how many men were with the animals, not knowing that in some cases the two were one and the same.<br />
Jose had some ammo left, but preferred to save it for when the odds were better in his favor.<br />
There was always the one last bullet for himself, to leave the truth and his real employers a mystery that hopefully even the Feds would never solve.<br />
If he got the chance, Jose would send one last text message to that patsy Jack Crawford to implicate him even further in events that he had no actual involvement in, but first Jose had to get away from the people hunting him.<br />
So he ran.<br />
His heart was pounding harder in his chest.<br />
Every other breath seemed to be a struggle to obtain.<br />
He stayed in relative shape, despite living a life of luxury when he wasn&#39;t taking the lives of others for money.<br />
<i>It would be truly ironic if I died from a heart attack now,</i> he thought, even as Jose ran into a clearing.<br />
Then, he saw it.<br />
He was on top of a brief uprise, and below him was a hint of a crescent shaped lake on the horizon.<br />
<i>Of course,</i> he realized. <i>If you&#39;re going to call the town Moon Lake...</i><br />
Then the barking dogs shook Jose out of his brief moment as he resumed running.</p>
