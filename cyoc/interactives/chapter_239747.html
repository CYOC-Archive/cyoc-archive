<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Olivia and Mike were in the middle of love making as they became Lamias but before they realized what was happening. A lone figure was moving toward the sound of moaning coming from a nearby building.<br />
<br />
Lily ran down the sand covered street as best she could but with each step, she sunk down a couple of inches making it hard to run. Suddenly she tripped and fell into the sand, spitting up some sand she got back to her feet, as she did she felt a hand on her back. She turned and for a second thought a figure was looming over her, however what she thought was a human or something else disappeared before she got a good look at it. <br />
<br />
Brushing it aside she got up and moved forward toward the sound of the moaning. It was coming from an area she knew Chloe was. The two of them had been searching this area while Olivia and Mike were searching for another and Emily and Diego searched another. She and Chloe had foolishly decided to split up to cover more ground and now she was regretting that choice as she heard soft moaning coming from up ahead where she knew Chloe should be.<br />
<br />
“Damn it be alright.” Said Lily her long blonde hair bouncing a little as she ran. She was fit, she always had been, having grown up the only girl in a family of boys she had become a tomboy. She ran track, played soccer and thanks to her late dad was a pretty good boxer. The only thing she really took care of as a woman was her long blonde hair that went almost to the small of her back. <br />
<br />
She was only a couple of feet away from the building where the soft moaning was coming from when suddenly she tripped and fell into the sand. She got up only to notice that everything felt much cooler. She looked down and watched as her clothes seemed to melt away as they turned to sand and joined the rest of the sand on the street.<br />
<br />
She just stood there stunned for a moment looking at herself in the nude when she felt something come up from behind her. She was too afraid to move as she saw a purple amethyst scaled covered tail came into view. It surrounded her multiple times but didn’t touch her.<br />
<br />
“You know I have a crush on you.” Said Chloe’s voice behind her as she came into view. She had changed, she was also nude, but her bust had grown in size going from a solid C cup to what had to be a D. She also seamed to have a natural beauty make up on and now those purple amethyst scales on her arms and around her body seamed to sparkle in the moon light as she came closer and pressed her body against Lily’s side pining her arm in her cleavage while one hand moved to the small of her back and the other raised up and taking her by the chin turned Lily toward herself. “Say no if you want me….”<br />
<br />
She never got a chance to answer as Lily’s face moved closer and gently kissed Chloe. Chloe let out a moan of pleasure as her hand which had been on Lily’s chin moved to wrap itself around Lily’s neck, a neck which was changing growing slightly longer more elegant as bright orange scales along with some bright neon yellow scales. Scales appeared around her eyes making an orange scale eye shadow which caused her blue eyes to pop in a breath-taking beautiful way. Her natural blonde hair became a rich golden yellow which matched her scales.<br />
<br />
Lily turned slightly pressing her bare breasts up against Chloe’s, earning moans from both as Lily’s modest breasts grew in size as well, while she didn’t have the rack that graced Chloe’s chest it was good none the less. <br />
<br />
Lily’s arms became covered with scales bright orange and neon yellow just like the ones which graced her neckline. These scales didn’t go up as far as Chloe’s did only really covering her hands while the scales around her neck expanded to cover the top of her shoulders as well but leaving the middle clear.<br />
<br />
Lily legs fused together as a powerful new tail began to form, it grew and grew until it was longer than Chloe’s having to reach at least 11 if not 12 feet long in total and covered with rich orange scales and strips of bright neon yellow in a multiple bands. Their tails wrapping around each other even as they remained “standing”.<br />
<br />
Neither of them really cares as they had moved from a make out session into something more as they made love in the streets. Both of their eyes rolled back in their heads as they neared their climax. When that happened they both moaned each other’s name before falling backwards into the sand both breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
 As they came down from their eye and while they both remained in bliss they just lied there for a couple of minutes before both of them sat up and looked at where their legs had been and the new snake like lower bodies which had replaced it.<br />
<br />
Screams followed as they realized what had happened to them.</p>
