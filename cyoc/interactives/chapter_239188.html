<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jo munched idly on a French fry and glanced down at the pile that still remained. It was almost shocking how comparatively small her appetite was in this new body; normally she&#39;dve been able to tear through a double cheeseburger at In-N-Out without a second thought and be ready for more, but she was already feeling a little full. Well, the milkshake probably contributed to that, she thought.<br />
<br />
She glanced over at Mike (no, Michelle, she reminded herself,) who was in about the same position and hadn&#39;t even had a double. Jo wondered how she was doing; she&#39;d been obviously nervous going into this, and ever since the change she&#39;d seemed somewhat uncomfortable. Or...she wasn&#39;t sure how to put it? Uncomfortable <i>letting</i> herself be comfortable, maybe...? They&#39;d known each other for three years, now, but there were still things about Mike she didn&#39;t totally understand; he could be hard to nail down, sometimes, and there were times where he&#39;d suddenly express strong feelings on something he&#39;d never apparently had an opinion on &#39;til he was pressed with a question or a choice, like there was a raw nerve buried just under the surface. She hadn&#39;t felt like she ought to pry, but Jo definitely got the feeling there was a lot more going on inside of him than he let on...<br />
<br />
Well, she didn&#39;t mind it too much; he was a good guy, and he&#39;d become a good friend over the last few years. But this tracked with that, she thought; she&#39;d never have pegged him for a conspicuously macho type, herself, but turn him into a girl for some wild and crazy science experiment and she got all prickly and self-conscious about it. Jo hoped she&#39;d get a little more comfortable in her new skin, given some time to adjust; they <i>were</i> gonna be like this for a whole year.<br />
<br />
Granted, she was surprised that <i>she</i> was as comfortable with it as she was. She&#39;d never had any issues with being a dude, but it seemed like she didn&#39;t really mind being a chick, either, which she was pretty sure she wouldn&#39;tve guessed. She&#39;d been just as nervous as Mike, after all, but the change wasn&#39;t so bad, and aside from the basic strangeness of suddenly being all different, she felt pretty at-home in this new body. It probably didn&#39;t hurt that she was a stunner, but to be honest she still hadn&#39;t quite internalized that; not that she wasn&#39;t getting looks from people - the clerk, a boy whose freckles did nothing to disguise the fact that he&#39;d yet to graduate from the gangly-and-pimply phase of adolescence, had spent the entire ordering process talking to her chest - but it was hard to think of herself as a Hot Babe when she was still new to even <i>being</i> a woman.<br />
<br />
She glanced down at herself, still marveling. This figure was the kind of thing you saw on the cover of old pulp magazines, but somehow it was her new reality; even knowing what she did about her genetics, it was still kinda staggering. She hadn&#39;t been <i>ugly</i> as a guy, but she&#39;d never been <i>hot,</i> and she wasn&#39;t sure how she was supposed to feel about all this. If you were a bombshell, shouldn&#39;t you <i>feel</i> like a bombshell? But more than anything, she felt...<i>sturdy.</i> 36DD was the stuff of teenage fantasy, but <i>on her</i> it was the weight, the <i>solidity</i> that felt...oddly comforting. She liked the way they felt on her, the way they moved with her; the fact that they caught the eye of everyone around her was almost <i>superfluous,</i> really.<br />
<br />
Well, she might feel differently at the end of the day, even <i>with</i> the support of her bra (she hadn&#39;t told Michelle, but it was the lacey red one; she liked the look of it on her, and it <i>was</i> comfortable,) and it was very possible that the stares would get old quick, but she supposed that was just life, as a woman. Besides, it wasn&#39;t going to be the weirdest thing she dealt with in the coming year. She was still trying to wrap her head around the idea that she was gonna <i>lay eggs</i> once a month; even having the nurse&#39;s assurance that it was preferable to the normal process, it still seemed kinda freaky. But then, so did the idea of having a period, and <i>that</i> was apparently &quot;just life&quot; for most women...<br />
<br />
Jo was still mulling that over when her phone pinged. She didn&#39;t recognize the number, but unlocked it and glanced over the text message she&#39;d gotten:<br />
<br />
<i>Hi, Lindsay from the lab here.<br />
<br />
Dr. K said to let you know we&#39;ve handled things; the R.A. at the women&#39;s dorm has a room prepped for you.<br />
<br />
Call the lab if you need anything, and drop me a line if you have any questions about &quot;hen things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Welcome to the flock, both of you ;)</i><br />
<br />
She&#39;d signed off with a chicken emoji; Jo wasn&#39;t sure whether to find the pride she apparently took in this any weirder than the rest of the situation, but went ahead and added her as a contact. &quot;That was the lab,&quot; she told Michelle, &quot;saying our dorm room&#39;s ready. Anything else you need before we head back?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girl sighed and shook her head slowly. &quot;I&#39;d say &#39;a stiff drink,&#39;&quot; she said, &quot;but that&#39;d probably be a bad idea even <i>if</i> I knew what my limit was like now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo laughed. &quot;I get you,&quot; she said, &quot;but relax, it&#39;ll be fine. Remember, as far as anyone knows we&#39;re just two totally normal college girls transferring in from somewhere else for senior year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle got a funny look at that, but nodded thoughtfully to herself as they took their trays over to the trash cans and headed back out to the car.<br />
<br />
- - - - -<br />
<br />
They arrived back at the campus in short order, but Michelle pulled into the parking lot of the men&#39;s dorm out of habit and didn&#39;t realize &#39;til she was just about to shut the engine off. When they&#39;d parked at their new dorm they found the R.A., a tall African-American woman who gave off serious no-nonsense den-mother vibes, waiting for them, a couple of manila folders in hand. &quot;We got word from Kelly Labs that a couple of &#39;transfer students&#39; were coming in today,&quot; she said. &quot;By the descriptions, that&#39;s you girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, that&#39;s us,&quot; Jo said, a little surprised that she was obviously clued-in; she&#39;d expected the lab&#39;s contacts to be more with the administration. Well, that was fine, she guessed; this woman didn&#39;t seem like the type to blab to anyone and everyone. &quot;Um, did our stuff get &#39;transferred&#39; already, or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman nodded. &quot;We took the liberty of stashing the clothes in the drawers under the beds, but the rest of your things should be about where you&#39;d expect them. You&#39;re in 313-A; I&#39;ll get you your keycards and the IDs the lab provided when we&#39;re done here.&quot; She started counting off on her fingers, dropping into what was obviously a common spiel. &quot;There&#39;s laundry facilities in the basement and a shared kitchen on the first floor; the stuff in the pantry and fridge is communal, but it can get used up pretty quick, so you&#39;ll want to pick up a mini-fridge for any perishables you want to keep stocked privately. We do expect you to clean up after yourselves if you do any cooking; I try not to be a hard-ass about it, but if I hear you&#39;re making a habit of leaving your dishes for other people to wash, we&#39;ll have words.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo wondered a little at the fact that the women&#39;s dorm was better-equipped than the men&#39;s; <i>they</i> didn&#39;t have a kitchen, did they? ...No, wait, there was that room with a refrigerator and a sink and an oven, but the fridge had stuff living in it, or possibly had evolved into some kind of lifeform itself, and the oven was used strictly for frozen-pizza purposes; the sink was, as far as she knew, not used at all, apart from the occasional fratboy looking for somewhere to vomit. There <i>definitely</i> weren&#39;t any dishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not a co-ed dorm,&quot; the R.A. continued. &quot;Male visitors are allowed, and we won&#39;t ask questions about what you get up to provided you&#39;re discreet, but we do expect you to show some consideration for the other girls on your floor. <i>Capisce?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a moment for them to process the implications. &quot;That, uh, shouldn&#39;t be an issue,&quot; Michelle said, blushing furiously; Jo couldn&#39;t help cringing a little as well, though she wondered if the sex-change treatment would alter anything in that regard, or if the staff at the lab even <i>knew</i> that, as yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s first-aid kits in the common room on each floor. Shared computers, as well, but I&#39;ll be honest, they&#39;re not terribly secure, so for the love of God don&#39;t log into your bank website or anything. And...that should about cover it,&quot; she concluded, opening the folder and pulling out a sheaf of paper and several cards.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are the official dorm policies,&quot; she said, &quot;which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll read as thoroughly as you did at your last residence, but which I&#39;m obligated to give you anyway. There&#39;s a keycard for each of you, and a photo ID provided by the lab that I won&#39;t ask any further questions about. If you need anything, or need to report anything, I&#39;m in suite 101 - ground floor, left-hand wing as you&#39;re coming in the main entrance. I&#39;m Leah, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
They took their cards from her; Michelle got saddled with the paper. Jo took a look at her ID; sure enough, it had her name as JOSEPHINE M JONES, her sex as F, and the photo they&#39;d taken of her back at the lab, and looked exactly like a regular California driver&#39;s license. She wondered what kind of strings they were able to pull with whom to get something like this on the spot, but decided that she was better off not knowing.<br />
<br />
Leah led them up to the third floor and down the hall, and knocked on the door of 313-B. After a moment, it was opened by a lanky, bespectacled blonde. &quot;Oh hey, Leah!&quot; she said, and glanced over to Jo and Michelle; her eyes immediately lit up. &quot;<i>New people!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah chuckled. &quot;Girls, this is Charity,&quot; she said. &quot;Charity, as you&#39;ve already guessed, these are your new neighbors, ah...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jo,&quot; said Jo, offering a handshake, which the other girl received and returned vigorously before pulling her into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...Michelle,&quot; said Michelle, a little awkwardly; she didn&#39;t offer a handshake, which she assumed would be a cue to not bother, but which actually led Charity to skip straight to the hugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re transferring in for their final year,&quot; Leah said. &quot;I&#39;d say &#39;if it&#39;s not too much of a burden,&#39; but I don&#39;t think I could <i>stop</i> you from helping them out while they&#39;re getting settled in.&quot; She turned to Jo and Michelle. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you to it, then, but as I said, don&#39;t hesitate to drop by if something comes up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get along fine,&quot; Charity said, beaming. &quot;Come in, won&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She led them inside. The room looked pretty much like the ones in the men&#39;s dorm - old Cold War-era construction with basic furnishings and a forced-air vent under a window that they knew from experience was draftier than it had any right to be, connected to 313-A through a shared bathroom - but cleaner and better-kept. Another girl was seated at a portable digital piano which was set up in front of the window, and it took a moment before she noticed them in the glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, hi,&quot; she said, doffing her headphones and rising to greet them. She was a petite Asian beauty, slightly shorter than Michelle but a little fuller-figured, with lush black hair in a bob cut. She seemed friendly, but a little shy and unsure of herself, and kept glancing around the room as if she wasn&#39;t quite comfortable looking at them directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jae, this is Jo and Michelle,&quot; Charity said. &quot;Jo, Michelle, this is Jae; she&#39;s a freshman in the music program. Believe it or not, she was a guy originally, but she&#39;s participating in some kind of scientific study or something, and now she&#39;s a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither of them quite knew how to respond to that. &quot;O-oh, uh...um,&quot; Jo said, after a minute. &quot;You&#39;re not, uh, trying to keep that a secret, are you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jae scuffed her foot on the carpet, looking a bit sheepish. &quot;Well, I&#39;m, ah, not really <i>advertising</i> it,&quot; she said, &quot;but it&#39;s a pretty open secret. It&#39;s just...well, I didn&#39;t manage to land a music scholarship, and my parents...kinda really wanted me to major in something else. This was the only way I could find to cover tuition, so...here I am, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charity smiled warmly. &quot;Well, you make for a very pretty girl, I hope you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jae flushed slightly. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve only <i>been</i> one for three days,&quot; she said, &quot;but...thanks, I guess...?&quot; She turned to her new neighbors, clearly hoping to change the subject. &quot;A-anyway, how about you guy-uh, girls? You&#39;re transferring in, right? Where from? What&#39;re you majoring in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo and Michelle glanced at each other, only just now realizing that they hadn&#39;t bothered to come up with a cover story...</p>
