<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Nrrrroooooo!&quot; You howl as you push away yourself from the kennel lady your pants makes you trip and fall on your back. A canine yelp escape your lips as you land hard on the floor. Before you have anytime to react the zoo lady is over you. She grabs your arms and presses her hip against your hip. You can't help getting a little aroused by the situation and for a second you stay perfectly still before your mind gets back to reality and you start to wriggle, trying to get out of her grip. You start to pant in fear as you watch your orange muzzle with a white mark and a pink nose grow longer and longer out from your face. You try to bit her face as your face gets closer and closer to hers because of your muzzle. &quot;Easy boy, easy&quot; She says trying to calm you, but how can you be calm!? She's trying to take your human life away!. Suddenly she lets goes of your arms and grabs your muzzle instead. You desperately try to open your jaws, but this only causes pain as she has pushed in your lips into your mouth between your teeth, making every move of the jaw painful. You push out your arms to try and push her away, only to discover that your hands are now full canine paws and your arms are shortening and getting thinner. You desperately push your paws into her face, trying your best to push her away. This just causes a bit of a annoyance on her as you're getting weaker by the minute. She starts stroking your head with her hand. You feel your ears pull back, and this is something that worries you. You start to let out pitiful whines as you make one last attempt to get her off you by trying to kick her with your legs. But your struggling starts to diminish as everything seems foggier and it starts to think of what to do next as she continues to stroke your head. She starts talking in some gibberish sounding language to you, as you desperately try to to sniff out what she's trying to do to you. Is she angry on you for doing something bad? Is that why she has putted you on you back like this? You wonder. She stops petting your head and look deeply into your eyes. She shows her teeth to you and you should be threatened, but you know that when the two leggers show their teeth, they're usually happy and she smells happy too. She gets off you and lets you go. You roll over on your side, looking at her and waiting for a command. You start to feel all strange between your legs, a tickling feeling with occasional stabbing feelings, but it doesn't hurt allot. It feels like something is expanding inside of you. Maybe it needs some cleaning? You think to yourself and bend down with your head, but you discover that something is covering your sheath making it unreachable, something uncomfortable. The she two legger starts making those strange noises again. Suddenly your hear something that you recognize: &quot;Stand!&quot; You get up on your four feet without a thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy!&quot; Sarah the kennel worker praises the newest addition to her kennel. The Toller looks at her curiously and the part of the tail that stick out of the underwear he's still wearing is slowly wagging. His fur has a pretty rugged look because of the fight he gave while transforming, some spots in the fur also seem less dense then others, not full grown. His hind legs also look strange, everything that used to be his feet looks allot thicker then the other parts of his legs, she looks at the lone sock still hanging on one of the dog's hind paws. His shirt and underwear also hangs on, even though there's no human left to wear them. He is also remarkably larger then a toller. Sarah sighs, this one isn't done yet but at least now she can work without having the transformee trying to bite her, bark at her, kick her or run away from her. She snickers as she remembers a man she changed into a poodle last year. He caused so much trouble. he even managed to sneak out of the zoo, get into his car and drive a couple of blocks before he changed so much that he could no longer drive the car. He crashed into a tree and was taking to a hospital, still transforming. When he arrived at the hospital he was a full poodle without a trace of humanity left, making the story that the ambulance personnel &quot;made up&quot; unbelievable. Later he got adopted by one of the doctors, where he now lives as a normal pet dog. &quot;Well it's about time I get you out of those clothes&quot; she tells her new canine friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know?...&quot; She says as she starts to unbutton the dog's shirt. &quot;...I was really lucky that I managed to change you so easily. Guys are usually a pain in the butt when they change. They always struggle so much. Woman, you see are easier. They usually just get terrified and cry. Even though I'v met a few bitches that really could bite... But you...&quot; She puts her index finger on the dog's nose making the dog almost go cross eyed because he follows the finger with his eyes. &quot;pretty much just gave into it. Are you sure you did not want this to happen?&quot; The dog just stare at her. Sarah snickers &quot;No of course not, you didn't want this to happen&quot; She lifts one of his forepaws out of his shirt arms and then she does the same thing with the other foreleg. She folds the shirt and put it on the floor and she pulls of the sock that's on one of his hind legs with a yank. She kneels beside him as he tries to see what she is doing. She smiles at the dog &quot;Now lets see how big sheath you've got&quot; She grabs the two legs of the dog's underwear and pull it down. His bushy fox like tail starts wagging, happy that it's free at last. She peeks in between the legs of the dog. <br />
<br />
Her smile disappears, her eye brows lowers and she opens her mouth slightly. She grabs the dogs collar and examine it for a few seconds. Then she cover her mouth and tries to stop a giggle. The dog stares at his master, wondering what she is doing. &quot;I'm sorry, but I must have accidentally taken the wrong collar for you. But I don't think you'll mind or notice any difference for that matter&quot; The bitch looks between her legs and doesn't seem to notice the lack of a male sheath or ball sac. Sarah pulls out a comb out of her pocket. &quot;Now, lets comb out the last of your fur coat. Then I should take care of the rest of your body. And you know what'll happen after that?&quot; The bitch looks up at her mistress face. Sarah smiles and leans closer to the bitch's face and let her tongue bath her face. &quot;Then'll take you for that walk I promised&quot;               <br />
