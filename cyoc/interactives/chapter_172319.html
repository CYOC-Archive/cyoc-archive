<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you think about bullies, your mind probably conjures up a hulking brute, possibly a jock, who is physically and psychologically abusive for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
But Noah&#39;s bully was anything but.  She was the prettiest girl in school.  Ashley Lennox had always been popular, and everyone seemed to love her.  She was below average height, with long, strawberry blonde hair, blue-green eyes, a flawless complexion, and a great smile that displayed perfect teeth.  If she had a flaw, it was possibly her small breasts, but really, that was barely anything to comment on.<br />
<br />
And yet, inside the body of a sweet girl beat the heart of a tyrant.  Ashley could be unbelievably cruel to anyone who earned her disfavor- and Noah had been in her sights for a long time.  Like everyone else, he&#39;d believed the myth that Ashley was some kind of perfect human being, until he&#39;d given her a valentine in the 5th grade.  She&#39;d made a production of tearing it up in front of everyone, and ever since then, he&#39;d been shunned by anyone remotely popular.<br />
<br />
Noah wasn&#39;t a bad looking guy by any means, with light brown hair and grey eyes that, especially when he wore his glasses, looked wise (if a bit sad).  He was slenderly built, and tended to avoid confrontation, making him seem meek and mild mannered.  Noah was a dreamer, often lost in his own private world, and he really didn&#39;t care much for silly high school drama.  &#39;The best years of our lives, huh?&#39; he scoffed at the idea.<br />
<br />
Anything he could have ever been recognized for had been ruined by Ashley.  When he tried out for track (he loved to run), she spread rumors that he was gay.  When his English teacher praised his writing, she stole one of his stories and mocked it by reading it aloud at lunch.  If he got a good grade, he&#39;d be accused of cheating.<br />
<br />
It just went on and on, so Noah decided to go through his life by being average and not standing out.  He started to slouch, he barely talked.  If he&#39;d applied himself, he could have easily won a scholarship by now.  In a world without Ashley, he&#39;d have been popular enough to run for Student Council President.<br />
<br />
But this wasn&#39;t that world.<br />
<br />
It was a chilly October morning, and it was raining- Noah&#39;s least favorite weather.  He was walking home, because Ashley had decided today would be a great day to make him miss the bus.  How she had arranged for the combination to his locker to be changed he didn&#39;t know, but he&#39;d seen her snickering at him with her friends as he&#39;d trudged out of the building.  Ashley, of course, never needed public transportation.  Despite the fact she&#39;d failed her Driver&#39;s Ed test twice, someone was always happy to give her a ride anywhere she wanted to go.<br />
<br />
And he had two more years of this.  He picked up a rock and threw it an impressive distance.  Did we mention he could have been an amazing pitcher?  Another possible future ruined by Ashley&#39;s bullying.<br />
<br />
Not satisfied iwth the one rock, he reached down again, but paused as he saw the glint of gold.  He picked up the simple gold band and wondered how it had gotten here.  It reminded him of the One Ring, and he put it on.<br />
<br />
It seeemed to fit pretty well, but no such luck, he didn&#39;t turn invisible.  &quot;I guess it would be too much to think I&#39;d be the one to find a magic ring.  Bah.&quot;  He sighed.  &quot;I wish it wasn&#39;t such a long walk home.&quot;<br />
<br />
He set off on his way, but to his surprise, he must have made better time, because he was only a block away from his house!  Once he got there, he stripped off his wet clothes and got in the shower, setting the ring on the sink.  After he felt warm again and toweled off, he saw it and wondered what to do with it.  Pawn it?  Sell it online?  Find it&#39;s owner?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right, I&#39;d be accused of stealing it, with my luck.&quot;  He put it back on for now.  He made himself dinner (he lived with his older brother, who worked long hours at the steel mill), ever since their parents died in a car accident years ago.  Then he watched some YouTube videos and turned in early.<br />
<br />
That night, he had a dream that he was wearing a crown, seated on a golden throne.  Vast wealth surrounded him, and several beautiful girls were at his feet.  &quot;All this can be yours, whatever you desire.  You only have to ask for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tossed and turn restlessly, and when his alarm went off, he felt like he&#39;d just gone to bed.  He groaned and started to get ready for another day of school.  The rest of his day was uneventful, until his last hour class.  He was heading their, taking his usual route, which took him north of the library.  It took longer to get there from his last class, but he&#39;d long ago learned that he would encounter less students in the hall.<br />
<br />
And then, rounding the corner, was Ashley.  She had a sad expression on her face, which was a rare sight, but once she noticed him, it turned into a malicious sneer.  &quot;Oh look, it&#39;s Nobody Noah!  What a loser, have you been avoiding me?&quot;  She walked up to him, and started in on her usual barrage of abusive comments.<br />
<br />
Noah tried to get by her.  She was going to make him late.  And then he noticed something.  Ashley wasn&#39;t a tall girl, but he&#39;d always thought she was only a little shorter than average.  Today, though, she seemed shorter, and he was easily a head taller than she was.  And then he noticed something even more relevant.<br />
<br />
She was alone.  Usually, Ashley was surrounded by a pack of sycophants that called themselves her friends, but really, they were just as bullied by her as anyone else- they just did her bidding to avoid being a target.  It was her pack that gave her power.<br />
<br />
He sneered.  &quot;Really, Ass-ley?  You&#39;re going to mess with me here, when you&#39;re all alone?  I&#39;m tired of the abuse, you bitch.  I don&#39;t know why you hate me, but I&#39;m tired of it, you hear me, you little bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened.  &quot;You fucking asshole, how dare you...&quot;<br />
<br />
He cut her off by moving right up to her, looming over her.  And then he pushed her to the ground.  Noah wasn&#39;t a violent person, but he&#39;d been pushed too far.  &quot;Shut up!  You think you&#39;re a queen, but you&#39;re nothing!  You think after high school anyone is going to put up with your shit?  If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll get married to one of these Neanderthal jocks, and end up pregnant before you&#39;re 19!  You&#39;ll be nothing but a trophy wife or a baby factory, and once you&#39;re fat and old, your precious hubby will start drinking, cheating on you, and probably start beating you up ever night- and you&#39;ll be too weak to do a damn thing about it!  You&#39;re nothing but a little girl, too small and tiny to fight back!&quot;  He leaned down and grabbed a handful of her hair.  She screeched but he just shook her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you&#39;d just shut up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mouth clamped shut, and she stared at him with eyes full of fear and tears.  She really did look like a little kid, and he suddenly felt like an ogre.  &quot;Whatever, you&#39;re not worth it.  When we were kids, I thought you were the sweetest, prettiest girl in the world.  I thought I was in love- I just wanted to be your friend!  What happened to you, to make you such a bitch?  I wish you were person I thought you were- somebody who could love me.  But instead, you&#39;re just a hateful, mean little kid.  Don&#39;t ever mess with me again, or you&#39;re going to get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, he left her crying silently in the hall.<br />
<br />
Later, after school...</p>
