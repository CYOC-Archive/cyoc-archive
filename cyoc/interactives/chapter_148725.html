<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You awoke with a start. You could not tell where and are confused until after a few seconds when your mind began to clear away the cobwebs. Your senses gradually returned as your disorientation faded, and with them came a terrible taste in in your mouth that you had become all too familiar with. Normally sleep was your one escape from the waking nightmare your life had become. Lately however you had been have strange, vivid dreams. One in particular seemed to occur with unwanted frequency, and this was such an occasion. In the dream you were human again. You are running through a vast field under a cloudy, red sky. Suddenly there is a howl heard from behind and your blood runs cold.   You look back to see a colossal wolf&#39;s behind looming over the mountains far off behind you. It&#39;s so big that it rises into the clouds and eclipses the sun. The posterior stretches as far as the mountains themselves. The ground them crumbles beneath your feet causing you to fall into blackness only to be met with the sight of the same titanic rump as before. You scream as you plummet towards it, the tail raised to reveal a winking anus the size of a city! You scream again when you realize that your heading right for it! It opens to receive you and scream again as you fall into the abyss at the center of the sphincter. Then you wake up, hoping to be anywhere else, but the horrific taste of residual wolf shit in your mouth confirmed each time that nothing had changed. You were still imprisoned as the wolf&#39;s anus. You still could not believe it. How did this happen? She appeared to be just a wolf, albeit a big one, but she obviously was anything other than a normal wolf. Normal wolves cannot transform people into part of their bodies.<br />
<br />
 You cursed out loud, your voice being heard by no one as it emerged as nothing more than a hot, steamy wolf fart. The moist gas passed your pucker lips, leaving an awful taste and producing an equally dreadful odor. You questioned how you still had any senses at all. You no longer possessed a tongue or nose, yet you could still smell and taste. You suspected that your former taste buds had been distributed around the opening of your anal form. As for your sense of smell, you were not sure how it worked now. Perhaps you could &quot;smell&quot; through your moist skin? Hearing was just as much of a mystery without physical ears. Sight was the most peculiar. You actually had eyes. Sort of. In truth your &quot;eye&quot; were in fact a pair of birthmarks located on the upper portion of your dark, puckered anus body. They resembled two tiny black dots the size of pinheads on the skin of the wolf&#39;s butt-hole. All things considered, your eyesight was poor, but at least you could see somewhat.  Smell and taste seemed to be your strongest senses, then hearing, then sight. <br />
<br />
The cave you found yourself in was deep into the forest. At lest several miles. Currently you were tucked beneath the beast&#39;s tail, bathed in the cloying, overbearing heat radiating off her vulva just beneath you.<br />
<br />
You could here your mistress snoring and though it was difficult to see, the dim lighting inside the small cave that the wolf made her den told you that the sun was starting to set. This meant that your lupine captor would soon awaken herself. You no longer can recall just how much time had passed since that fateful day when you ceased to exist as a human male and became a large she-wolf&#39;s sentient anus. You lost track after a week, but if you wagered a guess you would say it was coming up on a month at least. A month endured as another creature&#39;s ass-hole, and she had definitely broken you into your new role over the past few weeks. Most days went the same. Your host would arise at dusk. She would leave her cave to relieve herself on the trees outside, you resisted each time but it all proved pointless. The wolf would simply assume direct control of you as she dedicated, forcing you to suffer as her hot waste was forced out of your mouth. The canine likely did not even notice your feeble attempts to fight her. She had claimed you in mind, body, and soul! You could refuse her no more than a  big toe could refuse the body it was a part of. After her potty break. She would head to a nearby stream to drink. Then came the search for food. Some nights she would go without catching anything, but often she would nabbed an unfortunate rabbit or even a deer. Being literally the end of the wolf, you could not see her kills, at least not until they made a trip through her digestive system and were squeezed out from between your tight lips. During a take down all you saw was a brief gimps of the world beyond the wolfs ass rush by in a blur of motion. All you would here is her growling, and the death cries of whatever she decided was dinner. After eating the she-wolf would wander the forest, relieve herself again, and return to her den upon the sun&#39;s first light to sleep and do it all again the next night. <br />
<br />
There was no less than at least one wolf pack that called the forest home. Your mistress did not belong to it, but it did not stop the males in the pack from catching her scent. You had caught sight of a few of them. Whenever your mistress raised her tail to fart of shit. She knew they were there as well. On more than one occasions did a bold young male or two approach her, only to be sent packing after she snapped at them. They never stayed gone though. They knew she was there and despite her dwarfing the lot of them,they tried their luck. You hoped your mistress continued to turn down their advances. You did not want to witness a wolf mating session from the perspective of one&#39;s anus.<br />
<br />
Just then your owner stirred. She raised her head and yawned before licking her chops. She just sat there a while, curled on the ground. Once she had woken fully she huffed and raised to all fours. She lowered her front as she stretched out her front legs then did the same for her hind legs. The wolf smelled the air. Night was calling. She started walking, each paw that struck the earth sent a shudder up her rear legs and to you. The soft, puffy flesh that made up your new form jiggled ever so slightly with each tremor that reached you. You twitched and contorted with the natural movements of the the wolfs backside while in motion. Just then you felt it. A pressure in the back of your &quot;throat&quot;. You knew what it was. You could feel the bloated mass swirling within. As she exited the mouth of the cave, the wolf lifted her tail and boisterous noise was heard as she passed gas. The taste was horrendous, and you screamed in agony which only caused the wolf to fart a second time.<br />
<br />
It was demeaning. You had been utterly dominated by this supposedly lesser creature, your humanity robbed, and the wolf did not even seem to notice. She did not just ignore you. To be ignore requires to be known. You were simply forgotten, even worse than that. You had effectively been erased, removed from the annals of history as if you had never been born. There was no way of telling were you ended and your wild mistress began. You no longer had a life of your own. Hopes and dreams of the future no longer had merit. Your sole purpose in life was to function as the endpoint of the gray wolf&#39;s gastrointestinal tract. To be farted and shit out of. The wolf was your future. The wolf was your life. The wolf was all that was and ever will be.</p>
