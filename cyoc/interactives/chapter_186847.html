<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The newly regressed Melissa - Ethan upon some light testing realized his fluids appeared to have an effect on her due to him having just imbibed his serum so close to the sexual encounter - and Ethan as well decided to head up to go see Carl. &quot;I&#39;m going to go check up on our dear boss, Carl,&quot; Melissa said with a mischievous tone.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t expected Ethan to get up and start looking for some test clothes as well, sliding them on with a great degree of difficulty. &quot;I think I&#39;ll go see how our dear boss is doing too.&quot; Ethan was telling himself that he was just doing that to make sure things were okay with Carl. It did seem like there were some additional mental effects going on.<br />
<br />
If he had to guess it had something to do with the chemistry of the brain and its formation during the teenage years. During teenage years certain parts of the brain were not fully formed yet. And the brain chemistry was not exactly 1:1 what it was during adulthood. This resulted in the brain being much more predisposed toward reckless and self-endangering---ahh, he got the picture.<br />
<br />
Maybe something worth quantifying in the lab. Ethan was pleased to note that it seemed like his mind was not or minimally affected by the regression. He still had all his scientific smarts, and now he was back to his powerfully built, youthful form at eighteen. Oh how he remembered the days when he was this young.<br />
<br />
Muscular, the desire of every young woman (and more than a few young men, not that he went that direction!), and regarded as the handsomest man on the football team. He was almost the face of it, really.<br />
<br />
Then his accident with his leg happened, and things all went a different direction than he would&#39;ve liked. But now? Now he could actually relive his life as he wanted. It would just take a few forms and letters, and he could return to high school and live out the best years of his life again.<br />
<br />
Melissa had never felt so hale and healthy - it seemed indeed like the drug had an effect on how healthy the individual was after regression. She definitely hadn&#39;t been this much of a dynamo when she was actually this young. The newly eighteen year old Ethan conducted a test on himself to make sure, going forward, if his ahem emissions would have some sort of effect - and to his satisfaction it seemed that the levels of serum suffusion was down enough to make any more libidinous activity...doable.<br />
<br />
As the two headed into the elevator, Melissa looked over at Ethan and asked, &quot;So what makes you want to go see him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Ethan said calmly, &quot;I just want to make sure he&#39;s in good condition, you know, a doctor&#39;s check up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Melissa teased him a little, &quot;You wanna play doctor with him, big guy. Gonna check his pulse... test his fitness... see how his dick looks at full---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing like that!&quot; Ethan waved a hand, blushing a little bit, &quot;Nothing like that at all...&quot; He trailed off, wondering if he was even telling the truth. Carl had definitely regressed well, and he could appreciate that. His body was ripped, and the tone was something to be admired. Sure Ethan had size on him, but there was an element of masculine beauty to Carl. An element that even as Ethan assured himself nothing was going on he found himself thinking about more and more.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not gay or anything, Ethan reassured himself suddenly.<br />
<br />
By the time the elevator got to the top floor, Ethan was a little more conflicted. He remembered all the &quot;no homo&quot; moments in high school. Slapping Dale the Wide Receiver&#39;s prominent rear end after a long game and belting out &quot;no homo&quot;. Leaping on to Brad the Linebacker&#39;s back after a gamewinning play and the same exact refrain...<br />
<br />
Well, they were jocks after all, Ethan told himself. Guys like that, we fool around and we misbehave, he continued.<br />
<br />
Carl was seated at his desk, looking over his daily work as the CEO, though he seemed bored by the whole ordeal. His shirt was off, resting behind him on the chair, his new baseball cap on his desk. A small smile was on his face despite the boredom - after all, how bored could he really be when he had gotten everything he wanted? <br />
<br />
And then when he saw Melissa and Ethan - charming, alluring Melissa and well built, handsome and brawny Ethan - his eyes widened as he realized what went on most likely. Though he had no idea of the sexcapades that had preceded their arrival there, he absolutely gawked at the state his employees were in. Needless to say there was a prominent bulge in his pants before long. After all he was physically sixteen! &quot;W-Wow! Did...did you two...did you really...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we did,&quot; Ethan responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it felt amazing!&quot; Melissa added, &quot;Now we can definitely keep up with you and all your energy, Carl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl for his part felt a surge of excitement - on top of returning him to his youth, Ethan and Melissa had went ahead and regressed themselves as well. His feelings for them now were vastly more complicated than he thought possible. What he felt when he saw Thomas was a mere afterthought compared to the conflict he felt now. He felt a deep sense of longing - for powerfully muscled, handsome Ethan and beautiful, athletic Melissa.<br />
<br />
He felt himself getting hot, his face going a little red with a blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Carl?&quot; Melissa asked with a smirk, &quot;I think it&#39;s pretty obvious what you want. You can&#39;t keep your eyes off me...or Ethan for that matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, really?&quot; Ethan turned and looked at Melissa briefly, and then at the almost drooling Carl, who seemed to have one hand perpetually at his groin. &quot;You---you want BOTH of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...&quot; Carl had to work up the courage - feeling more shy about this than he had any right to be despite the fact he knew he was mentally older than he was physically, &quot;Yes! Yes! You&#39;re both amazing looking! C-Can we...? Can we three all enjoy each others&#39; presence here in my office?&quot; Carl right now was too excited to care if it came off a certain way.<br />
<br />
Ethan however felt a sense of conflict momentarily. He never before really acted on any man on man kind of inclination. He considered himself straight...but with Melissa here, their erotic activity just a little earlier... well, he was willing to experiment and be open-minded. &quot;I don&#39;t usually do this kind of thing. But you two have me interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa clapped her hands - she usually wouldn&#39;t be up for something so soon, but now, she had reason to be excited. The huge football stud Ethan and the toned, tight bodied Carl... this could be fun!</p>
