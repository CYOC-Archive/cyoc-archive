<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis grabs some pants and makes his way downstairs with his mother. As he gets to the bottom of the stairs he hears his father,<br />
“Selena, do you think I should drive him home? Maybe we can discuss...” His father stops talking as he notices Alexis on the stairs, “when did you get home?” He asks, speedily walking to his son. He looks him up and down, then wraps his arms around him, “I’m glad to see you’re alright,”<br />
“Floyd, why would he not be okay?” Selena asks her husband,<br />
“Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’ll explain it to you later. Right now, we need some man-on-man talk,” Floyd says, patting his hand on Alexis’ shoulder firmly,<br />
“Okay, I’ll leave you to it,” Selena says, “I’ll be upstairs if you need me,”<br />
“Alright, sweetie. Love you,” Floyd says to Selena as she makes her way upstairs. He stares at her until she is completely gone, “okay,” he says, taking a deep breath, “let’s go sit down.”<br />
<br />
Floyd leads his son to the nearby living room, seating himself down on one of the two couches. Alexis sits on a different couch next to his father,<br />
“Okay, son. I just want to ask you a couple things,” Floyd starts. Looking at Alexis. Alexis sits there, staring blankly into space. He had finally been given the space and time to just sit and think about everything that had just happened. Alexis couldn’t stop himself. He started crying.<br />
<br />
“Alexis,” his father said in a comforting manor, “just let it all out?” He told his son, opening his arms for his son to cry into. For at least three minutes, Alexis sat there, unable to do anything but cry. He cried and cried.<br />
Eventually, Alexis sat back up and wiping his face with his sleeve,<br />
“Do you want to talk about it?” His father asked, “my question can wait,”<br />
“Y-yeah... I need to tell you...” Alexis sniffed, “and you’re not going to believe me because it’s going to sound crazy,” he assured his father, <br />
“Go on. I’m listening,”<br />
“I... I... I can change things...” Alexis said, “change things in ways that don’t make sense... and I have no idea how it happened or why I happened or-”<br />
“And this started this morning? On your 18th birthday?” Floyd asked,<br />
“Y-yeah, and I know it sounds stupid but you know I’d never lie to you,” Alexis said, wiping his nose.<br />
<br />
“Alexis, I believe you,” his father responded. Alexis looked up, surprised by how quickly he convinced him,<br />
“Y-you do?” Alexis asked,<br />
“Of course I do,” Floyd said. He started laughing. He stood up, running his fingers through his black hair, “I had a feeling it would be today,” he said aloud,<br />
“What?” Alexis asked, puzzled,<br />
“So let me guess, you accidentally transformed half your school?” Floyd asked Alexis,<br />
“W-wha... yeah I guess so...” Alexis replied, “but how would-” Alexis was cut off as his tongue suddenly started getting longer. It was too long to keep in his mouth so he had to spit it out. It grew until it was at level with his belly button. Alexis wasn’t able to speak,<br />
“You have the power, Alexis!” His father said, filled with joy. He was smiling with delight, unable to contain his happiness. He looked back at his son, “oh, sorry,” Floyd said. Alexis’ tongue quickly returned to normal length.<br />
“So I inherited the power!?” Alexis chimed in, able to speak again, “from you!?”<br />
“Absolutely!” Floyd said. He let out a calm breath, before composing himself suddenly, “I don’t usually act like that. But I am very pleased that I can share my power with you, son,” he explained, “let’s just go over the basic rules it follows.”<br />
<br />
Alexis and his father sat comfortably on the couch. Alexis’ father cleared his throat, then began speaking, “as you understand, your power has the potential to change anything. It can change people, animals, objects, even yourself. This I’m sure you’ve realised,” he looked at Alexis, who nodded, “there are virtually no limits to your power. I’ve even gone as far as to change every living creature on the planet,” he said, Alexis was amazed, “of course, it completely drained me, as did reverting everyone and making them all forget. However, don’t even try doing that yet. You’ve only just gotten your powers so you need to get used to them first,”<br />
“Okay,” Alexis said, making it clear that he was listening,<br />
“So first, tell me how you found out you had powers,” Floyd asked,<br />
Alexis hesitated, but told his father, “um... I woke up this morning and felt strange, then I took a shower and... masturbated... and after I...” Alexis choked on his words,<br />
“Orgasmed?” His father finished. Alexis going a little red from embarrassment,<br />
“Y-yeah... then I looked down and saw my- um... penis... was gigantic,”<br />
“So you’ve had to deal with that for the whole day?” Floyd asked,<br />
“N-no. I managed to reduce it,”<br />
“Wow,” Floyd looked astounded, “all in the first hour of having powers. Impressive,”<br />
<br />
“Now one of the things that I didn’t get used to for the first year or so was your emotions affecting those around you,” Floyd stated, “I’m sure you’ve noticed that by now. Not just emotions, any general issues will result in people around you being affected. Like being angry will make people around you weaker, and being happy will make other happy too. Now, a lot of things can make an individual aroused, not to mention your pheromones have increased significantly.”<br />
“T-they have?” Alexis questioned,<br />
“Of course! Have you not picked up on how people are acting around you. People are more likely to flirt and tease you. Many more people will be attracted to you, Alex,”<br />
“Wow...” Alexis sat for a moment, thinking about it.<br />
“Now let me just make it clear. You are always in control, of your powers. Everything is able to be fixed, always. However, if you lose control, you won’t be able to do anything until you are back to normal. Like, for example, the shower. You weren’t able to control yourself and your penis got too big, too fast, because you were too excited.”<br />
Alexis was silent,<br />
“Right?” Floyd asked,<br />
“Y-yeah, I thats right,”<br />
“Good. Now I doubt you’ve had any orgasms in school, but for any reason, did you?”<br />
Alexis was silent for a moment too long, “maybe...”<br />
“Who, where, and how many?” His father asked,<br />
“Like, I don’t know... nine or something...” he said, looking at his father,<br />
“Jesus!” His father shouted, “in your first day!? Completely changed?”<br />
“Y-yeah...”<br />
“Good god, you need to rest!”<br />
“No I can’t, I need to fix the people!” Alexis said. Realising what he had forgotten to do,<br />
“Nope, I will sort it out. I’ll fix your peers while you go take a long sleep. No questions,”<br />
<br />
And with that, Alexis’ father disappear right before his eyes. That was amazing. His father had the same powers he did, and he inherited them. He would have someone to teach him how to use them!<br />
Alexis knew his father was right, he didn’t realise just how exhausted he really was. He made his way upstairs and into his room. He slipped off his clothes, excluding his underwear, and almost immediately fell asleep. <br />
As he drifted into sleep, his mind ran over the whole day. It was like a dream. <br />
But it wasn’t. This was his life.<br />
This was his power.<br />
