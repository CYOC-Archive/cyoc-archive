<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...Mythological Teachings,&quot; Sarah said as the static finally faded. They found themselves on the fictional island of Fabula, surrounded by crystal waters, rocky spires, and tiny spits of land. Apart from that they could see nothing for miles out. &quot;okay this looks cool and all but I would like to have a way to get home&quot; Ally said turning around. She stopped and gasped causing her friend to look too. Sarah saw the loading bar was still there despite the island already being made. &quot;I... don&#39;t think it&#39;s done yet,&quot; Sarah said. She was right as the static appeared in places across the island and sky. Plant life appeared across the ground after the static dissipated. The sky gained clouds and sun from the static too. Once that was done the bar moved again. This time structures appeared across the island. The buildings looked medieval, with some fantastic elements in them. Soon a growing mass of static surrounded them before fading into a castle&#39;s courtyard. With another bump of the bar decorations filled the courtyard. To the girl&#39;s left was a massive set of doors cut straight into the side of the rock.  <br />
<br />
A smaller set of doors was built into the left massive door. &quot;that&#39;s Alzrun&#39;s cave&quot; Ally said. Shaking her head Sarah ignored the static as it filled up the space. &quot;come on we have to find the remote&quot; she said. Of course that was easier said than done. The static then took the forms of humaniod figures and animals. There were several humans with mythological creatures by their sides. Some were the size of insects while others were as big or bigger than their owners. Each of them seemed frozen in time, even the birds and flying myths were stuck in midair. &quot;let&#39;s get out of here before they ask us how we got into the castle&quot; Ally said.  <br />
<br />
The brunette then saw the static cover Sarah&#39;s body starting at her shoes. &quot;woah&quot; was all Sarah said. The feeling of the static was different from the bar or even going into the TV. Instead, it felt like being in a warm bath as a masseuse massages your body. Her shoes grew several sizes as they became sabatons. Inside her feet had grown several sizes and gained some hair on them. On her calves, greaves covered them as the static went up. Inside her calves gained a decent amount of muscle so she wouldn&#39;t have trouble moving in the armor and hair on her tougher skin. Her pants turned green as her thighs bulged within them. The most interesting thing was her waist. Under the cloth, her ass thinned as her pussy pushed out. Her ovaries descended into a hairy sack as her womb vanished. Her clitoris was pulled like taffy into a throbbing seven-inch cock begging to be played with. A leather belt appeared holding up his pants. It had a diamond-shaped emerald as a buckle.  <br />
<br />
A red sash also appeared there to provide comfort whenever he rode. When it passed over his torso he lost his hourglass figure. Instead, he had a decent-sized v shape due to his larger muscles. Beneath his breastplate a treasure tail formed up to his new pecs, they got a thick forest to match the bush surrounding his dick. On his widened shoulders, large pauldrons appeared covering his green shirt. Thick bushes of hair grew under his arms. Past his elbows, his gauntlets covered his forearms and hands. The once smooth finger grew large and callused. The nail polish was gone as the nails were shortened. From his left shoulder to his right thigh an orange belt appeared connected to a sheath on his back. A sword handle protruded from it and was easy for him to reach. Finally, his head changed. His thickened neck gained an Adam&#39;s apple as his hair shrank into a short messy boy-style cut. His facial features were then rearranged. His lips thinned as his nose grew. The last thing to change was his eyebrow which thickened. All this happened in a matter of seconds. &#39;Sarah&#39; then let out a moan as he cumed in his pants. The static then covers them and makes them clean again. Ally was shocked as she recognized who Sarah looked like now. Her friend was now almost identical to the main protagonist of mythological teaching, Simon Walker. The main difference was that her hair and eyes were still the same color.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, you all...&quot; Ally stopped speaking. Like her friend the static spread from her shoes up. However, to her, it felt like a sauna. The even bigger difference was that her height began to skyrocket. As the static finished covering her shoes, her socks dissolved as well. Her big toes ran up her feet as black claws the size of a human hand grew from her growing toes. The two middle toes grew a little more than the otter ones. Her new 43-inch paws then gained a coating of red scales as her ankles raised. This raised her height even more from 8&#39;11 to eleven feet. Her calves and knees soon became covered in the static as it passed her ankles. Once it passed she gained another six feet from her scaled legs, thus bringing her up to seventeen feet. Her calves were now massive boulders and her knees were as large if not larger than her head. Once the static covered her thighs though an interesting thing happened. Right at the hip joint Ally&#39;s body rotated 90 degrees forward. Her muscled thighs were now mountains of pure muscle covered in red scales. On her rear several black bumps grew on her now muscled ass. From her ass, she now stood at twenty-three feet tall. Her anus changed as black scutes grew in front of it. The static pulled her tailbone with it quickly. Soon she had a massive 33-foot tail covered in red scales and black scutes dragging behind her. Its tip ended in a giant black spear as large as her friend&#39;s. While this happened her ovaries like her friend transformed as they descended into their sack, it then became covered in black scutes. The static reformed her pussy lips into a slit hidden from view unless it was forced open.  <br />
<br />
Which it was as a massive pink cock grew. this cock was just over six feet long and almost three feet wide. Its length was covered in spiky ridges to stimulate arousal for both him and whoever he mated with. The head looked vaguely human with a pointed tip. &#39;Ally&#39;s&#39; torso barreled out with his front protruding a bit more. A pair of wings with red membranes grew from his back. Each &#39;finger&#39; and &#39;thumb&#39; ends in a black claw. On his back, a brown main grew down to his tail. His arms became covered with so much muscle that they looked like giant stalactites. His elbows and wrists remained as flexible as they were thankfully. He even kept his thumb. Each finger grew a large black claw. While this happened his pants, shirt, and underwear were transformed into a black harness with silver buckles. The harness secured a brown saddle that wrapped around the base of his neck, as his neck grew his hair sunk into his new main. It became short and messy on his head. Above his growing ears a pair of long black horns grew. His new oblong ears had a lighter red inside. Four black spikes grew on both his cheeks. His face pushed out into a muzzle as her headband turned into another part of the harness on his neck and a bridal attached to his horns. His teeth became razor-sharp fangs and a forked tongue. This time Sarah was surprised at his friend&#39;s transformation.  <br />
<br />
Ally had become the dragon partner of Simon Walker, Alzrun the brave. However, he had never seen a single movie or episode that showed Alzrun having visible genitals before. Before he could even speak Ally cumed for the first time with his cock. unlike Sarah&#39;s, Ally&#39;s cum remained on the ground. &quot;sorry I couldn&#39;t help... uh, when did you get so small?&quot; Ally asked. Ally raised his hand to point when he saw the changed limb. Seeing a fountain he ran over. he made it over to it in no time and stared into its waters. He recognized the dragon in place of his reflection. Although he was sure  Alzrun was bald and had green eyes not blue. He then turned as he heard Sarah running over to him. &quot;did the remote do this&quot; Ally asked. &quot;well we&#39;re in a show we watched and were now characters in the show so... I guess yes&quot; Sarah said. Her voice was that of a young male teen which matched his appearance. &quot;so how are you feeling?&quot; he asked. Ally wanted to say he was freaked out. However, he didn&#39;t feel that way at all. In fact, he felt amazing. He was Alzrun the dragon. &quot;maybe it&#39;s because Alzurn was optimistic or I&#39;m now a giant fire-breathing dragon but I feel great&quot; Ally said. Sarah would&#39;ve felt the same if it wasn&#39;t for the fact he had a boyfriend in the real world. &quot;yeah but we can&#39;t stay here. We have to...&quot;. the progress bar then finished loading the world. In an instant, everything began to move.  <br />
<br />
Simon Walker blinked as he tried to recall what he was saying. looking at his partner he saw Alzrun drinking from the fountain. &quot;hey Al, want to go for a ride?&quot; Simon remembered They were going to meet up with his girlfriend at Fang&#39;s peak. &quot;really? Let&#39;s go&quot; Alzurn said. Simon&#39;s emerald allows him to understand the dragon. He opened his palm and allowed Simon to walk on it before raising it to his shoulder. The teen then grabbed the bridal and Alzrun took off. Hidden in a nearby haystack the remote waited for someone to find it. Unless it was found before the episode ends in twenty minutes plus commercials this reality may permanently be theirs. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The third season of Mythical Teachings show began to broadcast on its channel. To the viewing world, Simon and Alzurn might have a slightly different look but Alzurn&#39;s genitals weren&#39;t visible to them. The scene begins with the clouds parting to reveal an island. &quot;this is Fabula. An island separated from the rest of the world. While most of the world looks at myths as freaks, inhabitants of this island call them partners&quot; Simon&#39;s voice narrated over images of the island&#39;s inhabitants. The scene then showed a group of kids chasing a fairy before a middle-aged man with a Minotaur partner stopped them allowing the fairy to make the flowers come alive and dance. a Satyr teen and his human partner danced around in the enchanted meadow as the view panels up to Simon on the back of Alzurn. &quot;life hadn&#39;t always been so perfect&quot; as Simon spoke visions of previous movies and episodes played on the screen. &quot;a few years back myths were just as hated here as they were elsewhere&quot;. The flashback shows a group of citizens running from a werewolf pack. The royal guard went and attacked this group as the scene shifted. &quot;I thought once that myths were dangerous creatures until I met Alzurn&quot;. It showed Alzurn&#39;s wing trapped under Bolder and Simon with an enchanted dagger. &quot;looking into his eyes I knew that we were wrong&quot;. Simon was then seen using an invention of his to remove the boulder. &quot;as my connection to Alzurn grew we found an emerald in a hidden cave&quot; Simon and Alzurn looked around with emerald in hand. They both spoke only to realize they could understand each other. &quot;it was then I learned the truth. The society of warlocks had lied to us about the dangers of myths. Humans can be both dangerous and friendly like myths.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It then switched to Simon getting a group of royal guard trainees to train their partners. First was his once rival Stevenson. His partner became a werewolf girl. Then was the nerd of the group Frank. His partner was an obese male phoenix. Next was the twins Rex and Tex. They had to share a two-headed hydra herm. Finally was Amy, she had the most fiery temper but was also the first to agree with Simon. Her partner was a female black-furred eastern dragon, a rare breed on the isle. Alzrun hit on Midnight several times before the fight. &quot;after they had picked their partners I taught them what I had learned&quot;. A montage of the group training in secret played out before the group went to confront the warlock that lives on Fang&#39;s Peak or as it was known then warlock Mountain. &quot;Melvin the bold tried to use many tricks to try and convince us to kill our partners but we would not listen&quot;. After the warlock failed to convince them what he was doing was right he attacked them. The fight seemed very one-sided. The warlock mortality wounded Stevenson. Ruby took him behind a rock. A shard of ice impaled Crux as he shielded Frank. The young lad looked horrified as the light faded from his partner&#39;s eyes. With beames of magic Melvin the warlock sliced off what he thought was a two-headed dragon. When he tried to destroy both Midnight and Amy Simon and Alzrun grabbed him and flew away. Melvin shocked the two and they fell into the center of the town.  <br />
<br />
Melvin was about to deliver the final blow when the king and queen came toward him and saw their son badly hurt. &quot;we knew we had to show the island how evil the warlock society was. Merely killing Melvin would just make them see that they were right to fear myths. instead, everyone saw Melvin for who he was&quot;. When the guards went to arrest Melvin he surrounded himself in green energy and vaporized several guards while insulting everyone. He was caught off guard by a lightning blast from Midnight. The now five-headed Bossex breathed fire at him while a now reborn and muscled Crux used his embers on Simon and Alzurn. Finally, Stevenson and Ruby came and pinned him down. Knowing he was beaten Melvin pushed the two werewolves back and shot a beam into the sky. A dome surrounded the island and nearby rocky spires. &quot;in his defeat, Melvin used all his power to blink Fabula out of reality. Once the dome disappeared only an endless ocean appeared past its boundaries. Having pushed himself past his limits Melvin gave a wheezing laugh. &quot;the warlock then said that we would never be able to take down his brothers now and no one back in our original world would ever know what we had discovered&quot;. His body then faded away and the flashback ended.  <br />
<br />
The screen now showed Simon&#39;s face before pivoting a good distance behind the two. &quot;while we have grown as a people I still haven&#39;t given up hope that one day we will find a way to get the truth to our old world&quot;. Alzurn landed at Fang&#39;s peak. &quot;hey Simon can you do the thing, please&quot; Alzurn gave the biggest puppy eyes he could. Simon sighed as he removed the gem from his belt. Last season it was revealed that Simon had magical powers and was studying to be a wizard along with his knightly/princely duties. Focusing his power through the emerald a beam of magic hit Alzurn shrinking him down to just slightly larger than midnight. It only lasted about an hour at a time. Something they unfortunately learned the first time. It took several episodes to fix the castle after that incident. &quot;hey you two&quot; Amy said as she got off Midnight&#39;s back. The two kissed before talking some more. &quot;now what&#39;s this surprise you have for us?&quot; Simon said. Amy smiled and revealed...</p>
