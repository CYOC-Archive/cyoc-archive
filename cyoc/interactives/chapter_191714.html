<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Based off of the original chapter from 14 years ago, I made a few changes to start a new storyline</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave began to write...<br />
<br />
Stevey Mitchell is actually Stephanie Mitchell, a 19-year old girl with an athletic build, with porn star breasts and a rear end that’s just as impressive. She is a lesbian. She always wears slutty, revealing uniforms to work. She is very flirty with women but has a general distaste for men.<br />
<br />
Dave didn’t realize that the pen was reading his deepest desires, forcing him to put them to paper. He decided to let his imagination go...<br />
<br />
She is seriously turned on by women and can’t stop herself from staring at them. She fantasizes about passionate lesbian sex often. The thought of women staring at her makes her very horny and she has to masturbate a lot every day because she gets so aroused working here. The only underwear she ever wears is skimpy lingerie, and often she doesn&#39;t wear any underwear at all.<br />
<br />
Dave couldn’t believe how good it felt to write all of this down. He kept going… realizing his deepest desire of all.<br />
<br />
“I am now Danni, an incredibly beautiful and sexy woman who is similar in personality and body to Stephanie; however, in both of these aspects, I am even more intense. I am now the owner and CEO of this company which only consists of my former floor. This is a company that produces sex toys and  fetish gear designed specifically for lesbians. The company will be successful and simple to run no matter what. Everyone in the office knows I’m a lesbian, but is respectful about it. My nickname is Danni the Dyke, which I take in stride. I am not an overbearing boss and all of my employees like me. I have a supernatural aura which impacts everyone I come in contact with. This is also activated by my new natural scent, which is incredibly pleasant instead of my former body odor. For men, I make them very attracted to me, but instead of anger from the rejection I give them, they feel incredible self loathing. They will still act friendly towards me and won’t hit on me again. At first, this is just the normal self loathing one feels from rejection, but it will grow more and more intense and eventually change to gender dysphoria before becoming an intense hatred of men and masculinity in general. A desire to become an attractive lesbian woman like me will permeate throughout their very being. While this is happening, physical and mental changes will form. They will become feminized and act in a girly, submissive sort of way, before their gender changes, eventually causing them to become similar to Stephanie - a horny, flirty, sexy man hating lesbian - however, they will be even more intensely beautiful and horny. Women will also change. If they’re attracted to men at all, that will lessen and eventually disappear, replaced with a burning desire for other women. Their bodies will become even more beautiful than Stephanie’s and their flirty nature and libido even more extreme. Stephanie is in the late stages of changing. Having lesbian sex and orgasming will increase the speed of the changes. Eventually, former men and women like Stephanie will gain the same impact and scent I have and I will assign certain women satellite offices for the sole purpose of changing people and making fetish wear and sex toys. No one will fully notice these changes except for me and who I choose to show this power. No one can use this paper except for me.”<br />
<br />
Danni moaned a bit as she changed. Her body was now completely female; she was a beautiful woman, her body extremely erotic. Her skin was slightly tanner than it had been as a man, and her dark brown hair had become silky smooth and now reached her hips. Her breasts and ass were massive, almost double the size of Stephanie’s. She had a face like a supermodel’s (or maybe a porn star’s,) with a small nose and large, puffy lips. Her outfit was very similar to a slutty librarian’s. She couldn’t believe this was her. She could even feel her thought process adjusting and her libido rise; everything felt different… better.<br />
<br />
As Danni put her pen down she heard the familiar noise of the post trolley being pushed along her floor.<br />
<br />
It was confirmed for her when she faintly heard Alan say, &quot;Morning, Stef!&quot; Danni looked over; there was a distinct grimace on her face - she had no desire to flirt with Alan. “Morning.” She said, coldly.<br />
<br />
The door to Danni’s office swung open and in sauntered Stef, her hips swaying flirtatiously as she tugged the post cart into the room.<br />
<br />
Danni looked her creation up and down. Stef had long, brunette hair and a deep tan. Her uniform shirt was tied and tucked underneath her large bosom and revealed her excellent abdomen. Her uniform skirt was short, very short, with pockets sewn into it and a long slit up the left side. Stef hefted a large box from the top shelf of her trolley and carried it to Danni’s desk, being sure to carry it so that her big tits rested neatly on top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go, beautiful,&quot; Stef smiled as she placed the box on Danni&#39;s desk, right in front of her so to display the maximum amount of cleavage as she bent over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; Danni stared in admiration before finally saying, &quot;thanks Stef.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, boss,&quot; Stef winked, &quot;I’ll do anything… you… want.” She said, staring Danni straight in the eye.<br />
<br />
Danni replied with a wry smile, &quot;Only if you call me &#39;Mistress&#39;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, I like the sound of that,&quot; Stef laughed flirtatiously as she went back to her trolley, &quot;I’ve always wanted to call you that, mistress.” She out extra emphasis on that last word, turning Danni on even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, isn’t that sweet?” Danni asked, as she watched the post girl bend over to grab something from the bottom shelf of her cart. She was keeping her legs straight, which caused her skirt to ride up...<br />
<br />
“I try to be as sweet as this.” Stef replied as she delivered to Danni a premium view of her snatch. Today was a no-underwear day, then.<br />
<br />
“I see you’ve taken my suggestion to heart. Keep doing things like that and you’ll move up in this company.” Danni said, taking in a good view of Stephanie’s pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mistress! Oh, you’ve got one letter today,&quot; Stephanie turned back to Danni’s desk and handed her a sole letter. &quot;You brighten up my mornings as always. See you later beautiful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you later, then, Stephanie.” Danni said, a bit sad. In her mind, Stephanie should’ve been desperate to sleep with her… maybe she’d done something wrong?<br />
<br />
She grabbed the pen once more. “I know why Stephanie didn’t fuck me just now.” She wrote.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the answer appeared. Stephanie didn’t want to get between her and her wife. “Well, I’ll just have to fix that, then…” Danni said with a wicked smile…</p>
