<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty almost felt a little pity seeing Dustin so beaten down, but he couldn&#39;t help but feel pleased at how his big, masculine stepbrother was now a very girly femboi in a big, girly dress. He liked the view but he had another idea in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;re learning your lesson, eh Dustin? I&#39;m going to give you a little reward for that&quot; Dustin immediately began to feel his body changing again, being bigger. His big dress did not allow him to have a full view, but the mirror and his sensations helped her to know that, indeed, he was changing. His height was coming back, his arms and legs were getting toned again, he even felt his abdomen get a little ripped, his face took on a few more masculine features and his waist was growing out again and he felt his butt deflate a little. However, there were other parts of his body that remained unchanged. His shoulders didn&#39;t seem to have grown to much, his nipples were still big and sensitive, his hair was still all over the place (he even thought had grown more) and his penis definitely hadn&#39;t grown (as he found out after fighting all that fabric for a while). When Dustin looked at himself in the mirror he could begin to recognize himself in the reflection, even so, he still looked too feminine for his taste, and the dress, tiara and makeup didn&#39;t help.<br />
<br />
Dustin didn&#39;t know what to think about this change. It wasn&#39;t specifically what he wanted, he wanted to be normal again, but it was certainly the closest he had come to seeing himself in several hours. But his instincts told him there must be a catch in this, the indelible smile along with Ty&#39;s expectant look told him so. &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Dustin said in his normal gravelly 16-year-old tone but was immediately shocked and realized that something was seriously wrong with him. &quot;Wha-what did you do to me??&quot; As hard as he tried, all the words that came out of Dustin were said only as a stereotypical fag would say it, it sounded just the same as when he was with his friends and he made fun of the way homos talk but this time he wasn&#39;t playing , there really was no way he can  put it any other way &quot;What did you do to my voice?! I sound like a fucking fagot!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Dustin. but you&#39;re a fagot&quot; Ty said mockingly. Ty turned and searched in one of the closet drawers in Dustin&#39;s converted room, it didn&#39;t take long to find what he was looking for. When he turned back to see Dustin had what appeared to be a rolled up poster, he moved closer to him until he was right in front of him and crouched down to face him. Facing Dustin&#39;s watchful gaze, he unrolled the poster, only to reveal what appeared to be the image of a male porn star, a very masculine hairy man, completely naked. Dustin was definitely not gay and that guy didn&#39;t make him feel another thing that disgust, but as Ty unrolled the image he could feel his body getting very hot and how his little package was really reacting instantly, getting the hardest he&#39;d ever been in years, he even felt his sensitive nipples grow hard. The little package of him wasn&#39;t big enough to move the fabrics of the dress, but when Ty saw Dustin&#39;s reaction, desperately trying to push him down and his entire face turning completely red, he didn&#39;t even need to see it to know how it was<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is happening to me??? Why would something like that make me...??&quot; Dustin said effeminately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for being gay it&#39;s normal for you to get that kind of reaction down there to something like this&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but I&#39;m not...&quot; Dustin tried to defend himself, but he could only feel his penis getting harder and harder, to painful levels he didn&#39;t think were possible, his body getting hotter and, above all, more sensitive. At this point Dustin had looked away completely but the mere glance seemed to energize his penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you&#39;d never consciously be with a man, but don&#39;t worry, I made your body help you a bit with that&quot; Ty said going to tape the poster to the pink wall of Dustin&#39;s room. &quot;I made it so that whenever you see a man you like, like a very masculine and hairy man, you have this kind of reaction, of course, I remove your body taste for women.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin listened to Ty in horror as he couldn&#39;t get his penis to go down, Ty continued &quot;Don&#39;t bother trying to avoid it, it&#39;ll just make you hornier. Every time you try to avoid your body&#39;s reactions you&#39;ll make yourself hornier so you better not avoid it. You better avoid resisting it and immediately wank you off to the image of a hairy, muscular manly man&quot; Ty said with a smile. &quot;Every time you get like this all you have to do is jerk yourself in the moment, visualizing your desired man. No matter where you are, your body will not come to its senses until you pleasure yourself like the slut that you are. Come on, feel free to start.&quot; .<br />
<br />
Then the fluffy dress disappeared. Dustin could still feel the tiara and heavy makeup, but there was nothing in his way to stop him from giving himself a handjob.<br />
<br />
Dustin was still in denial when, to his horror, his hand began to move on its own. &quot;I forgot to say, you have a time limit before the wank does itself&quot; Ty said even more amused. No matter how much Dustin used his other arm to stop himself, it was useless, his hand began to move up and down while holding his small penis, several images also infiltrated Dustin&#39;s mind, imaginings of him with the great man on the poster, for More than Dustin sought to distract himself with something else, he couldn&#39;t help but see that in his head, so much so that after a few minutes his eyes were closed involuntarily so that he could focus more on his imagination. He could only see himself fucking a man that look like a big bear on top of him, penetrating him. As much disgust as he might have given Dustin&#39;s conscious, his penis was reacting quite well. Several ejaculations later he was able to stop.<br />
<br />
After such an intense handjob, Dustin&#39;s entire body felt limp and he slumped, only to see Ty move closer again, then…</p>
