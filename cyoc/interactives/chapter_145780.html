<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s face was squished between the seat and maybe 100 pounds of muscle and fat, spreading him across the seat and overflowing past her hips. Jeff heard a feminine chuckle from somewhere above him as the seatbelts clicked into place. He felt a finger poke into him, the same voice saying, “I think you need to start working out more! Jeff is overflowing.”<br />
          Another voice then piped up, this one booming and defensive, but also feminine and familiar. “Mom! He likes being this big,” a few fingers stroked the side of Jeff that Liz’s mom touched, “and besides, I have been working out, but he hasn’t gotten any smaller.”<br />
          A click from higher up started a cacophony as the engine of the car started, shaking the car into life and causing Jeff to shake in place, “Then you might need to cut back on the cake.”<br />
          As the car rolled out of the driveway, Jeff felt every rock and every pebble, the tiniest bump shifting him this way and that. The car turned onto the road and Jeff felt his whole body flow to the right. It felt like he was on a small boat in a storm, each and every imperfection in the road sending jolts through him, and he was loving every second of it. Liz and her mom talked in the background, but Jeff wasn’t paying attention. He was too busy taking in the new smells, his nose only having just started working. Despite what he would’ve thought, between Liz’s cheeks smelled amazing, probably because she gotten out of the shower not long before the drive, but he didn’t need to know that.<br />
          The car had also gotten a bit hot on the drive, so Liz had opened a window. Jeff didn’t mind at all though, as he felt his face begin to sweat. With sweat came a new scent: Liz au Natural. The panties and pants happily soaked up the new scent, completely surrounding Jeff in his new favourite smell.<br />
          A few minutes of driving and a stoplight later, the car pulled into a parking lot. The key to the car turned, and Jeff stopped shaking. As the door opened, Liz turned on her ass to get out, Jeff enjoying the feeling of being rubbed into the seat. As she stood, Jeff was able to see through the front of the car, spotting Liz’s mom’s ass, which looked even bigger than his own girth. Jeff didn’t have long to stare, however, as his she stepped aside to close the door. Nonetheless, Jeff looked around happily at the world, its sights and sounds filtered through a haze of soft, taught panties, and an even softer black cloth, his body jiggling from a light breeze passing by.<br />
          Altogether, the landscape seemed almost alien.<br />
          Now came the fun part. Liz turned on her heel towards the trunk of the car and started walking. Jeff was first hit with the momentum of a sudden turn, her cheeks moving in sync before slamming into each other. For Jeff, it felt like a slap across the face, but for Liz, it felt like a small, silent clap. Next came walking. At first, Jeff didn’t feel anything, until her thigh slapped him in the face. Then, his entire world shook, his vision shifting with her ass as the entourage of waves hit him. He thought that from seeing it happen so many times that he’d be prepared to feel it, but he was wrong. His world became a mess of dulled colours and shaky sounds as each of his hemispheres was pushed up and down, the pair of pants stretched over him shifting and caressing every part of him as the panties tried to hold him firm. A little overwhelmed, he closed his eyes and tried to relax, knowing he’d gotten what he’d wanted.<br />
          Liz opened the trunk and bent over to pull out the two yoga mats. Having finally stopped moving, Jeff looked out through the stretched felt, the world now much clearer. In front of him he saw a busy road lined with a sidewalk and trees on either side. A dude on a skateboard stared longingly at him for a few seconds before continuing on his way. Jeff chuckled to himself, a small and silent poot escaping his lips.<br />
With the mats underarm, Liz and her mother walked off towards the gym, Jeff basking in the glory of her sun-kissed cheeks. On their way to the gym, Liz had a bit to think about. She&#39;d heard rumours of people being able to transform themselves into various things, but never had thought they were true. Similarly, she&#39;d known for a long time that Jeff had had a crush on her, but never did she think he&#39;d go as far as wanting to become her ass. Despite the weird thought of having someone as her ass, especially Jeff, she couldn&#39;t deny that she was enjoying it. She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but the concept itself kind of turned her on as well. She wanted to tell Jeff that she knew, but thought that would be a bit weird and embarrassing for him, so for now, she would stay quiet.</p>
