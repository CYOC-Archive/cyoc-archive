<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gladiators arena in Ancient Rome. A place of bloodshed and barbarism for the amusement of the rich. <br />
<br />
Leo was one of the few who had bested the arena and was given a second chance at life.  He married and had a son but his wife died soon after birth.  Leo has been raising his son Gaius on his own.  The boy had just turned 14 and had a prideful streak to him courtesy of overhearing his father constantly insulting the political elite who still managed the game’s.  <br />
<br />
Leo worked as a trainer for the rising gladiators that actually prepared to be in the arena voluntarily.  Leo often looked at them with hate for choosing to subject themselves to his past torcher for fame, but money was money.  <br />
<br />
Leo was hard at work preparing equipment for a new batch of trainees when a man by the name of Severus walked in.<br />
<br />
“Why hello Leo, long time no see.”  Severus always bet high on Leo back when he was in the ring.  He was always so gaudy, covered in precious silks and surrounded by a harem of men.<br />
<br />
The former gladiator despised Severus but he knew when to hold his tongue. “What do you want?”<br />
<br />
“I actually had a proposition only a strong man like you could possibly take on.”  Severus reached out to feel Leo’s bicep.  <br />
<br />
“Mmm quite nice.  I can still remember how you glowed after battle.  I had to pay quite the hefty sum in order for them to equip you with only the skimpiest of armor.”<br />
<br />
“Is that all you came here for? To stare slack-jawed at me?” <br />
<br />
Severus chuckled. “I’ve sat through dozens of gladiators after you but none are quite as impressive.  Oh remember the time the lion actually tore your loincloth?  The way you managed to still defeat the beast while weighed down by that cock of yours-“<br />
<br />
“Get to the point!”<br />
<br />
“I want you to be mine Leo, be my trophy and live with me in my palace.  All these years and your still just as handsome if not more so.  I have finally come to the conclusion that only you alone can satisfy me.”<br />
<br />
Leo pulled away.  “Leave me, I have no need for your corrupt coins or wicked promises.”<br />
<br />
“Shame, I promise you’ll regret this Leo.  For I am not one to lose on my investments.”<br />
<br />
After that encounter, Leo stopped getting as many trainees.  Apparently Severus was spreading rumors and even threatening people not to seek Leo for anything.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t right!” Young Gaius yelled at his father.  “Why won’t you stand up to him!”<br />
<br />
“This isn’t your fight boy.  You are unaware of the power Severus possesses.  In more ways than one.”<br />
<br />
“It may not be my fight now, but it’s going to be.”  Gaius stormed<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Leo later received an ominous letter that bore an strange crest.<br />
<br />
“If you want to see your brat again, meet me at my palace.”-S<br />
<br />
Leo made for the fiends home at once.  Constantly chastising himself for not better controlling his son.<br />
<br />
He eventually made his way to the grand estate.  “Severus!  Where is my son.”<br />
<br />
“Aw yes hello Leo, so nice to-“<br />
<br />
“I have no need for your silver tongue.  Where is he?!”<br />
<br />
“Not in the mood today are we?”<br />
<br />
Severus snapped his finger and the guards brought in a tied up man.  He was covered in jewelry, and little else.  Gold bracelets were attached to his strong arms.  A necklace resembling more of a collar hugged his thick neck.  He had what looked like a belt of small gold chains that held nearly transparent fabric.  The large penis was all too visible.  The man’s head was currently hidden with a satchel. <br />
<br />
“Why do you bring me one of your disgusting toys?”<br />
<br />
Severus simply laughed. “Come now Leo, is that any way to speak of your own son?”<br />
<br />
The guards uncovered the prisoner. He had a strong jaw and long caramel brown hair that waved and curled at the ends just below his shoulders.  <br />
The piercing green eyes is what gave it away.  <br />
<br />
“G-Gaius?”<br />
<br />
“Father I am sorry. this monster transformed me.” <br />
<br />
“Silence boy.  You’re lucky I didn’t order my servants to remove your tongue like my other slaves.”<br />
<br />
Gaius knelt down in shame.<br />
<br />
“I warped your son into my perfect playmate.  You should see the naughty things he’s capable of now.”<br />
<br />
“You turned by son into another ornament for your harem...”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t use the word “ornament” to describe him.  He’s now intended for some use and to be intimate me at side at all times.  Your boy is an accessory.”<br />
<br />
Leo looked towards his son.  Gaius simply looked down towards the ground in defeat.  Leo knew in his heart he had but one option.”<br />
<br />
“I- concede.”  The former glacier fell to his knees.<br />
<br />
“Take me in his place and reverse whatever dark forces did this to him.”<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid my previous offer of simply having you as a sex slave has expired.  I have a more exciting proposition in mind for you now.”<br />
<br />
Severus then waved to a servant to bring forward a gold goblet with what appeared to be wine within it.<br />
<br />
“You want me to end my life with poison?”<br />
<br />
“Now where would be in the fun in that?  Just drink, you have no better options.”<br />
<br />
Leo raised the goblet to his lips.  It smelled of rancid cherries.  As he drank he found that he couldn’t stop.  His hands and lips were glued to the container.  <br />
<br />
As he drank his body began to shrink.  His muscles regressed as he seemingly grew younger before Severus’s very eyes.  <br />
<br />
When finished the drink he was but a child, practically swimming in what used to be a rather form fitting tunic.  The many scars of the arena that coated his strong body were erased.<br />
<br />
<br />
“You have been reverted to a boy just shy of 13 and will be thrown back into the arena in the low level adolescent combat sports for the children of Roman traitors.”<br />
<br />
“You’re delicious son however,” Severus cooed as he licked the nipple of a restrained Gaius.  “Will be in the adult division of the games.”<br />
<br />
“NoOo.”Leo was shocked by his own high pitched voice as it cracked.<br />
<br />
“Take me alone instead! I beg you!”<br />
<br />
“I warned you of the consequences of not taking my first offer.  Don’t worry too much, there is still hope.”<br />
<br />
“If you and your son once again best the trials of the arena I will return you to your original forms.  In the meantime, The two of you shall live together in a separate sections of my palace. There you will act as your son’s trainer to make sure he has a fighting chance in the ring.  You better hope that you are an exceptional trainer, for his life is in your small hands.”</p>
