<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun slowly began to rise over another day in Moon Lake, we pause to see how our cast of characters are doing early this Sunday morning.<br />
<br />
MARTHA ANDERSON laid in bed next to her husband William. Counting the dating and engagement phase of their relationship, the couple had over twenty years together and two teenage children. Married life had not always been pleasant, especially with William&#39;s unfaithfulness, the last instance leading to him being fired and the family having to relocate to Moon Lake in hopes of starting over.<br />
That had been accomplished in a way neither of them could ever have foreseen.<br />
Although they had been part of the community for less than a month, William was now a werefox, and she a werecat, in part because of William&#39;s abrupt transformation and her coming to terms with the fact that she had been suppressing the bi-side of her personality for almost her entire life.<br />
But now it was like a whole new world, and a new life, was before her. Martha realized there was a bright future ahead and would never have to deny herself any sexual pleasure ever again. Not only had the relationship with her husband greatly improved, but there was now a lesbian couple in her life, and the three ladies loved each other very much both sexually and emotionally.<br />
The only dark cloud on the horizon was the reason William was now a werefox, and until the potential threat to him and her family was neutralized, the only rest they could have were stolen moments like tonight, as she snuggled up against her mate&#39;s furry body.<br />
<br />
WILLIAM ANDERSON stirred in his sleep, until realizing that it was his wife, Martha the werecat, moving to be closer to him.<br />
If asked, William might have voluntarily become a were in time, but the choice was taken from him and now he was trying to make the most of it.<br />
Yet becoming a werefox might have been the best thing that ever happened to him. During the first change a serious life mate bond had been formed, but not between him and the catalyst for his new life, but between William and his wife.<br />
There was no denying his love for her, which made him shameful of his past indiscretions. Yet now the werefox would always stay true to his werecat, even as William would stay true to Martha. Having to share Martha with her other lovers was just the price he had to pay for his past sins.<br />
He wrapped his paws around her and kissed Martha on the nose before trying to fall back asleep.<br />
Yet thoughts of the danger his family might still face disturbed his rest.<br />
<br />
Blissfully unaware of the full extent of the danger he might be in, ERIC ANDERSON awoke to answer nature&#39;s call.<br />
He had been having strange dreams all night. Once he thought he was on a pier at Moon Lake. Another time along the shore of a secluded stretch of beach on a tropical island. The one that awoke him occurred within a freshwater swimming pool that he was familiar with.<br />
Yet all his beautiful dreams had two common themes. Julie Stovall, the beautiful blonde girl with the deep blue eyes he had struck up a friendship with at school, and becoming the were-merman mate to her were-mermaid.<br />
Going to the bathroom, Eric started to take care of business when he felt something weird between his legs. He looked down as saw this odd, yet sticky white stuff clinging around his penis.<br />
Eric blushed as he realized what is was and what happened. <i>I had a wet dream!</i><br />
Cleaning himself off, Eric threw his soiled pajama bottoms in the laundry hamper, and then grabbed a towel before going back to his room. A quick check revealed no stains on the blankets or in the bed itself, but he put the towel across the mattress before he laid back down.<br />
The 14 year old freshman student had trouble going back to sleep. Thoughts of the werevixen that changed his dad having escaped from jail and being on the loose still ran through his mind, but Eric was confident the police would capture her in time, not knowing the full story of the threat she possessed.<br />
<br />
The werecats SAMANTHA AND FRANCES TWIST slept in their bed cuddled together after a wild night of stress relieving sex. Usually the married lesbians would make very passionate love to each other, but last night called for something more physical.<br />
The werevixen that had changed William Anderson against his will was not only on the lam, but was a serious threat to the Anderson family. Not just because that, in her deranged state of mind, she might kill Martha as part of some hackneyed plot to have William all to herself; but a bite or scratch from her would cause normal human Eric Anderson to unwillingly become a werefox like his father.<br />
Because or despite being Town Chancellor, the Mayor had personally asked Samantha to keep an eye on young Eric, because his daughter had taken an interest in the boy.<br />
Frances said it was only because they were friends, but despite the fact that changing someone against their will was Moon Lake&#39;s most serious crime (second only to taking another&#39;s life) Samantha couldn&#39;t help wondering if the request was because of another reason.<br />
Yet she would have done so anyway. Martha was not only their friend, but a member of their small LGBTQ pride, and Samantha Twist was not going to let anyone hurt a member of her extended family.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Twists&#39; adoptive son BEN had enjoyed a wild night of sex. His pack had welcomed his friend Nate into their group as its newest member, and decided to celebrate both that and the full moon with an orgy.<br />
With all females on were-birth control unless they either wanted a child (which had to be announced up front for those willing to take on the responsibilities of parenthood) or were past child bearing years, no male had to worry about fatherhood unless they were fully prepared for the experience.<br />
As Ben stirred awake to answer nature&#39;s call, he reluctantly tore himself away from the she-wolf he had his last encounter with before falling asleep in her paws.<br />
After relieving himself behind a tree, Ben went back to lay down with the she-wolf. He could see the first signs of dawn on the horizon, but knew it would be at least another hour before town laws forced everyone to resume their human forms in public during daylight hours.<br />
With that, Ben nuzzled up to his partner and started suckling on one of her breasts, hoping she&#39;d be up to another round before dawn, and wondered how his friend made out during the night.<br />
<br />
NATE ANDERSON was in heaven! Not only had all his wildest dreams of ever becoming a werewolf come true, but the 16 year old high school junior had found a kindred spirit and lost his virginity with Alex, the teenage male werewolf he had mated with.<br />
After his initiation into werewolf society and first change at Alex&#39;s paws, the two had spent a wild night together of hot passionate sex. During the brief rest periods, which were few and far between because the two lycans were seriously hot for each other, they had exchanged life stories.<br />
Alex&#39;s was short, having been born a werewolf and living his whole life in Moon Lake.<br />
Nate&#39;s took a little longer, especially the more recent parts, including his folks troubled marriage (not knowing the full extent of his dad&#39;s new werefox bond with his mom), the werevixen that had almost become between them, and the fact that none of his family knew that Nate was gay.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s tough,&quot; agreed Alex, while running a paw against Nate&#39;s furry chest. &quot;You should tell them eventually, but I can see why you chose to wait.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Things look like they might be getting better, but until I know for sure they are, I don&#39;t want to take the risk of telling them and putting more stress on their marriage than there already is,&quot; said Nate.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep your secret as long as you want me to, but I don&#39;t want us to be a secret,&quot; said Alex, as he started licking Nate&#39;s muzzle.<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Nate, while running his paws up and down Alex&#39;s fur coat.<br />
&quot;I would like us to start seeing each other socially. Even go out on dates, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mind? Here&#39;s my answer,&quot; replied Nate coyly, before going down on Alex again.<br />
The two young lovers stayed with each other well into the dawn&#39;s early light, with Nate blissfully unaware of what dangers his family might be in.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, YVETTE ELIZABETH ANDERSON, aka Yvette the werevixen and a lot of less favorable terms, had spent the night in the hollow of a tree near the town&#39;s namesake, Moon Lake.<br />
Thoughts of <i>her</i> William brought comfort, but the knowledge that she would somehow have to tear him away from that bitch he was unfortunately married to was an obstacle in what she thought of as her path to true happiness.<br />
That, and the fact that she was a fugitive from the law, having escaped from jail after being arrested for raping William and changing him into a werefox against his will.<br />
Now that the first rays of the new dawn were appearing in the sky, Yvette realized how dirty she was from running all night and being cooped up in that small, cramped jail cell while awaiting her arraignment hearing.<br />
Crawling out of the hollow, Yvette reluctantly changed back into her human form. A brief reminder of the need to find some clothes if she was ever going to obtain William for herself crossed her mind at the glimpse of her nude form, and then Yvette went skinny dipping in Moon Lake.<br />
She thought at such an early hour she was completely alone and just enjoyed her time in the lake.<br />
However, Yvette was unaware that she had been spotted by a fisherman down the shoreline.<br />
One who had seen the late news last night about the wanted fugitive, and even now was reaching into his tackle box for his cellphone to call the police.</p>
