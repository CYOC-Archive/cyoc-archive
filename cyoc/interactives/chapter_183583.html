<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kayla chanted her spell, James had to admit his large, muscular body was incredibly masculine. Sure, he might be a glorified lizard, but he could probably lift four or five hundred pounds without breaking a sweat! And yet, somehow James started to feel a lot less masculine for some unknown reason. No, that&#39;s not right: he simply felt a lot more feminine. Was it possibly to feel both? James was very confused, because knew he most certainly had not been transgender before.<br />
<br />
And yet, James&#39;s continued fantasy of becoming human again even though Kayla assured him he wouldn&#39;t, started to take a different form. The mental image of himself in his regular clothes started swapping back and forth with a new mental image of himself with bigger boobs wearing a miniskirt. Eventually, both idealized forms of himself settled into coherent pictures in his mind. He wanted to turn &quot;back&quot; into a woman? And he also wanted to be a man again?<br />
<br />
James&#39;s gender fluidity as a single being wasn&#39;t meant last long, because soon his mental voice split in two separate, simultaneous inner monologues. It was maddening!<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I why won&#39;t Kayla change me back?&quot; ~ &quot;Damn! I wish I had a penis in me right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aawww, I&#39;m so horny, gotta find a hot babe!&quot; ~ &quot;Why did I waste all my time as a human on guy stuff?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, what&#39;s that girl&#39;s voice I hear in my head?&quot; ~ &quot;Huh, that dude&#39;s voice sounds like my old one.&quot;<br />
&quot;WHO ARE YOU AND WHY ARE IN MY HEAD?!&quot; ~ &quot;STATE YOUR NAME AND BUSINESS, SIR!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;M JIM WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU BITCH!&quot; ~ &quot;I&#39;M JAMIE AND THIS IS MY BODY YOU PERV!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like having an alternate personality inside him/her. A massive headache boiled up inside the great reptile&#39;s brain, caught in the middle of a horrific mental battle between the voices in his/her head. The dragon growled, its snout widening, its vision shifting as its eyes were forced apart by some infernal ripping force in the middle of its head. Jim and Jamie&#39;s mental bickering picked up speed as they blamed each other for the exploding pain, and then--<br />
<br />
And then, it was over. Jamie felt normal, if a tad numb in places, and that intolerable male voice in head was gone, as well as the headache. She did feel a little tingly between her hind legs, but at least her head and neck felt about like they did after she had first changed into a dragon. Likewise, unbeknownst to Jamie, Jim felt exactly the same way. He was glad he had successfully resisted whatever demonic force had tried to possess him and convince him he wanted to be a girl. Puzzled about why he couldn&#39;t seem to feel very much on his left side, and surprised to find a dark green blur in his peripheral vision, he turned his head left. Jamie turned her own head right for the same reason. The two locked eyes, each taking a moment to gawk at the draconic face staring back. Turning their heads inward, each visually following the other dragon&#39;s long neck back to the shoulder&#39;s, they each shrieked like a kaiju at the realization of an extra head on his/her own body. Jamie dug her sharp teeth into Jim&#39;s neck, and Jim let loose a fireball into the air that immediately consumed the tent. Kayla, witnessing how disastrously her plan was backfiring, put her hands up. &quot;Now, now, let&#39;s not get carried away,&quot; she said like a preschool teacher, to no avail.<br />
<br />
The two-headed beast staggered out of the inferno and into the carnival walkway, knocking over tents and toppling concession stands. Bystanders fled from the monster-movie-like scene unfolding before them. Each head battled valiantly to be rid of the other, trying to get away but finding itself in control of only two of the four legs. The two heads spilled their shared blood and seared each other&#39;s flesh, failing to make progress against an equal and opposite opponent. The mighty tail thrashed aimlessly, not fully under the control of either head, unable to decide which to obey while both were locked in combat. Kayla was very nearly crushed under the tail as she ran after her creation desperately hoping to salvage the situation somehow. Eventually, the heavy dragon crashed through a flimsy wooden boardwalk and tumbled down into a hidden cave beneath the carnival, which was lit by magic lanterns and filled with damp, stale air.<br />
<br />
Surprised to find themselves underground as they rolled to a stop, they tried to keep fighting for a while longer before realizing they were running out of ways to get rid of each other. They both discovered they could talk again upon hearing the profanities bursting forth between fire breaths. Gradually, they both turned to the final option they seemed to be left with, which was to try talking to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Face it, you aren&#39;t going to be able to get rid of me that way. I&#39;m attached,&quot; said Jim to the head which was now only weakly nipping on his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit, Sherlock,&quot; Jamie retorted letting go of Jim&#39;s neck. &quot;What are you even doing here? Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is James,&quot; he said, &quot;but I prefer Jim for short. I wasn&#39;t always a dragon, you know. Kayla turned me into one, then something even weirder happened, and then you appeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what? I&#39;m James! The witch turned ME into a dragon! I&#39;ve decided I&#39;d rather to go by Jamie because it at least sounds like it could be a girl&#39;s name. Don&#39;t ask me why I&#39;m mentally a girl now.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first Jim was about to attack Jamie again just for claiming to be him, but then they both thought back to what happened before they found each other on opposite sides of the dragon. They remembered James&#39;s gender confusion, his mind splitting up, and then his head--their head--widening, and then feeling like it was splitting, and then... oh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are ... are we BOTH James?!&quot; Jim exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But ... but I&#39;m not you ... am I? Are you me?&quot; mused Jamie. They twisted their long necks around to look each other over more closely, seeking out any hints they could find, moving their legs in unison to successfully to stand up for once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was our first grade teacher?&quot; asked Jim. Jamie answered, &quot;Mrs. Kohara,&quot; and Jim gulped, unnerved that she was correct. &quot;What&#39;s our mother&#39;s maiden name?&quot; asked Jamie. &quot;Lucy,&quot; Jim replied. They went on questioning each other over several details of James&#39;s life for several minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; said Jamie at last. &quot;This will settle it once and for all: on the count of three, let&#39;s both blurt our most secret fetish, which we never even told our sexual partners but wished we could. 1, 2, 3! -- GROWTH AND MACRO TRANSFORMATIONS!&quot; They shouted the answer in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder I&#39;m so horny right now,&quot; Jamie commented, deriving some enjoyment from how large their combined body was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; said Jim, his voice a tad distant with kinkiness on his mind. &quot;I wonder whether our dragon body is male or female now,&quot; he pondered, not having the slightest inkling yet that it was both.</p>
