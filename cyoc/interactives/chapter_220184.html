<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“This reads like stereo instructions,” Rachael reading the book Enoch left for her; Treaty of Heaven and Hell volume two: crimes and punishment, read like a convoluted guide to nonsense for her. Sections and paragraphs, referencing a battle in heaven; a skirmish in hell. The book read less like a criminal code and more like a history lesson from the losing side of a war. About the only two nuggets of information she could glean were the following statements.<br />
<br />
‘Demons are free and clear to impose any sentence on a condemned human soul, so long as there is no attempt to torment/torture via temptation. Punishment for the sake of punishment is to be barred. Public displays of humiliation are permited so long as it is used to punish disobedience. Judges are required to be notified at minimum 24hours prior to and to witness and document such acts. Public participation is permitted. Public act of punishment are to be limited to certain locations within the nine circles of Hell and to take place during the afternoon hours.’<br />
<br />
‘Suicides are the one group of dammed souls to be deposited in the lake of fire. There is to be no exceptions as stipulated by Jehovah a witness and signatory upon the creation of this treaty.’<br />
“To take a life is a sin unto itself. To take your own life is the most unforgivable sin,” Rachael closing the book; “Ghastly.”<br />
<br />
“No system is perfect,” Maisy sighing as she observes the gardeners repair the damage the brimstone storm did to the flowers; “but this one is better than the alternative.”<br />
“And what’s the alternative,” Rachael looking at Maisy.<br />
“You know how the Old Testament referred to hell as a place of inferno torment,” Maisy responding; “well imagine that coupled with demons feasting. As in eating the condemned soul, watching said condemned soul regenerate and eating him/her over again. Rinse and repeat over and over.”<br />
“Cannibalism,” Rachael looking shocked; “like Kidney on a bed of Fava Beans cannibal?”<br />
“Only dialed up to eleven,” Maisy shaking her head; “At least that is what dad described when he and the rebels arrived.”<br />
“Fortunately he had the good sense to organize things,” Maisy grabbing the book and rifling to a page near the end; “and this treaty helped refine how punishments are doled out. Look at this page.”<br />
<br />
Rachael looked at the offered page and saw something that helped put things into perspective visa vi sentencing. Sentencing ranges for various offenses. On the lighter end; a sentence of several months to ten years of house work was listed for minor sins.<br />
However on the serious side; crimes such as murder ranged from one hundred years to five hundred in hell and were subjected to automatic re-incarnation upon completion of sentence. Crimes such as rape were just as harsh and had added mandatory acts of public humiliation. It was the only crime in which sentence enhancements were permitted. Then she noticed yet again the sentencing for suicides; eternal torment in the lake of fire.<br />
<br />
“Ghastly,” Rachael putting the book down and taking a sip of water; “and Enoch thinks I’ll make a good judge.”<br />
“Give it a shot,” Maisy smiling; “I once did.”<br />
“You a judge,” Rachael looking shocked; “how?”<br />
There is a section in the treaty that states all demons must serve at minimum twenty years as a judge every two hundred years.”<br />
“I got to do this for twenty years,” Rachael looking aghast.<br />
“Not all at once,” Maisy nodding at the gardener towards replacing the non-native plants that did not evolve to handle brimstone storms. “You can space the twenty years out in blocks. Do a year, take a year off. It’s beneficial to do it that way as a judge who is pregnant will be unable to perform their duties with a youngling to nurse.”<br />
“Okay,” Rachael nodding; “kind of like maternity leave on earth.”<br />
“Only better organized and gender neutral” Maisy nodding; “Why don’t you take a break from reading that book.”<br />
“I suppose,” Rachael standing up and stretching; “but I still need to look at that other book. Idiot’s guide too portal summoning,” Rachael looking at the sky to see the sun has not reached noon hour.<br />
<br />
**************************************************************************<br />
<br />
With Lord Enoch Moringstar the Grand Chamberlain to Lucifer’s court out on a personal family emergency; Lucifer’s court was temporarily cancelled. So Lucifer opted to attend the Senate; a Senate that Lamashtu was recently appointed to as president of. However with Lamashtu also indisposed, Laz Deathfire was acting president for the Senate. Lord Chancellor Nergal Deathfire was also present and it was clear he was looking as proud as a peacock; his wife was about to announce Lamashtu’s proposition 13666.<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************<br />
<br />
The senate erupted into a debacle; just like Hecate and Enoch both suspect would happen if the proposition was put in motion. Hecate’s warning of succession issue regarding the hardliner’s progeny was the first to come up. Laz tried to defuse the concern by adding exceptions and exemptions to try and placate them, but someone shot up shouting that it would create animosity and a class system for those who have no say in how Hell is run or born into a noble family. Enoch was right it would create a caste system; disenfranchise a lot of the demon citizenry and risk dragging hell to a civil war.<br />
<br />
Lucifer walked to the center of the senate in a bid to help calm down the irate crowd that is eager to lynch.<br />
“Calm down everyone,” Lucifer putting his hands up in a stop moving motion; “Even I have issues with this proposal.”<br />
“It is a sound proposal,” Laz interjecting; “what is needed is consensus to pass it.”<br />
“Judging by the reaction of the senators,” Lucifer looking at the senate president pro-temp; “that is not happening. So allow me ask you a few questions,” Lucifer looking serious.<br />
<br />
“First,” Lucifer speaking;” how do you intend to enforce this, when it clearly violates a major article in the treaty with heaven,” Lucifer looking at Laz. “The article that specifically states; that ALL demons are required to serve a minimum twenty years as a judge every two hundred years.” Lucifer looking at the senate, “The article makes no distinction if said demon is blood born or human born!”<br />
“I,” Laz stammering trying to find an out but was interrupted.<br />
“Secondly,” cutting off Laz; “I read a rough draft of this article last night. A rough draft made by my daughter,” Lucifer glaring at Laz; “in my private study. How did you acquire a copy after Enoch burned it before he stated that it would cause a civil war?”<br />
Laz couldn’t answer as she received the charred copy from her husband last night.<br />
“Senate demands an answer,” someone shouting.<br />
“Kill the bill,” Someone else begins chanting; a chant that rapidly picks up speed.<br />
<br />
“Silence!” Lord Nergal booming; “you will all calm down!”<br />
“My lord,” Nergal looking at Lucifer; “while I cannot provide an answer to your first question, I can however answer your second one.”<br />
“The crowd is listening,” Lucifer looking at the Lord Chancellor.<br />
“It was I that found the proposal,” Nergal answering to the sounds of gasps; “but I was only in your private residences for the purpose of ensuring security.”<br />
“That does not give you leave to rifle through my trash,” Lucifer glaring at his chief of secret police; “My private quarters are just that. Private! While I will relent that security is required,” Lucifer stating as he recalled last night’s failed attack from several condemned soul that were once iron knights; “what is not permitted is snooping. This applies even to you Lord Nergal Deathfire! if I find out you have been spying on me, my wife or any member of my family,” Lucifer glaring; “I will do more than strip you of your titles. I will strip the skin off your flesh and if necessary,” Lucifer looming over the embarrassed looking Lord Chancellor; “I will consult every legal expert, and search for whatever loop hole exists to chuck you into the lake of fire where the suicides reside! For being planted as a tree of woe in my garden would be too light of a punishment for treachery!”<br />
<br />
The entire senate sat in silence. No one spoke as Nergal slinked from the senate floor, with his wife Laz shortly following after. Then a clap could be heard, followed by a second; then a third. Soon the entire senate was applauding. Lucifer allowed the raucous display to continue a few moments before he motioned for silence.<br />
“As President Lamashtu Morningstar is currently dealing with a family emergency,” Lucifer speaking calmly once again; “I am imposing an emergency decree. No new motions and laws are to be passed until such time as stability returns.”<br />
“Is Lamashtu’s emergency anything to do with missing demons,” a senator speaking up.<br />
“What do you know of that,” Lucifer instantly turning to the speaker; “speak up!”<br />
“My son went missing last night,” the senator speaking;  I tried contacting Lord Nergal but he brushed me off say it was a matter with the local constable.”<br />
“Same here,” another senator shouting.<br />
“My sister is missing! She was last seen in the fourth circle!”<br />
“Are you all saying,” Lucifer looking like he just got hit with a migraine; “that it’s not just my family that has missing loved ones?”</p>
