<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris dreamt of swimming naked in a vast ocean. As with many dreams, he didn't know he was dreaming. Everything seemed natural.<br />
<br />
Knowledge of how to swim had awoken from within. Chris didn't know if he simply was remembering lessons from years past or if someone had implanted the knowledge in his mind.<br />
<br />
He felt at peace despite his nudity. This nudity was innocent, free and not in any way sexual. Chris hadn’t felt this way in a long time; his solitude helped.<br />
<br />
The cool water didn't bother him. An invisible shield seemed to insulate him.<br />
<br />
A voice barley louder then a whisper called out to him when he surfaced.<br />
 <br />
A splash from behind Chris had him turning to see a creature that one could best describe as an otter man floating before him. The otter man had brown fur with tan on his jaw and chest. Slightly longer fur on his head was the only suggested of what to a human would be hair.<br />
<br />
Chris gasped when he realized he was naked in front of not just another person but another guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, I'm sorry. I don't know how I ended up here naked,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is all right,&quot; the otter man said. &quot;There is no reason to be ashamed of your body. If you feel a need for privacy, I assure you that I will not look below your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No; thank you,&quot; the otter man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who are you? What are you?&quot; Chris asked. &quot;What are you thanking me for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see, I am an otter man. I know such creatures seem may seem impossible to you but I assure you that I am quite real,&quot; the otter man said. &quot;This may sound strange but I am the necklace. A bad man trapped me -- well, he turned me into that necklace,&quot; the otter man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God; that’s horrible,&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
The idea of someone trapping him in such a form horrified Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fear not, I wasn't conscious or aware while in that form. Only by wearing it -- me have you awakened and released me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Excitement went through Chris in mind and body. That this otter man couldn’t see the reaction relieved Chris. He wondered why the otter man was affecting him this way. Chris liked girls last time he checked. <br />
<br />
A self conscious feeling over Chris’ body not being good enough for the otter man replaced any worry of indecency or vulnerability.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why the necklace interested me so much?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, when someone compatible comes into contact with it, it breaks the curse and changes me back to my proper form,&quot; the Otter man said.<br />
<br />
Chris looked the otter man up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't we go to some place more appropriate to speak?&quot; the otter man asked. &quot;Oh yes, you may call me Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The area shimmered. Chris and Jake appeared on a beach. Water dripped off of Chris and Jake. A warm sun beamed down on both. The sand was hot but tolerable.<br />
<br />
Chris was still naked, as was the otter man. Jake kept his gaze to Chris' face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry for the sudden relocation. I assure you that I will only look at your face,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that it's just...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt his cheeks turning a deep shade of red. Why was he attracted to Jake? Chris looked Jake up and down, which only made things worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mind if you look, I just worry that I'm not good enough for you,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Jake took Chris's hands and smiled. A glance up and down and Jake was smiling an understanding smile. Chris’ heart was pounding over worry of rejection.<br />
<br />
“You have nothing to be ashamed about,” Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand; I like girls. Why am I reacting like this?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You felt drawn by the necklace because we are compatible,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we're both guys,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we are both male in body doesn’t matter,&quot; Jake said. &quot;If you worry about that, it's just me that you will feel this way about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do not feel guilt over your attraction to me. The body is but a physical thing. Our compatibility is influencing your desire to be with me,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are destined to be together,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
The revelation made Chris happy, not upset. Jake was appealing and drew Chris. This was more then a physical thing. His body's reaction was more of a consequence.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are seeing me as I am. Your body however, needs to change to be compatible with mine,&quot; Jake said. &quot;Now, I know this is quite the request but it's a condition to free me from this curse. It is much to ask but would you be willing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris gulped. &quot;Wait, you're saying that I need to become an otter man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nodded. &quot;You could also become an otter woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris backed up. &quot;I'm not sure I want to be a girl. This is too much. I'm glad I saved you and all, I'd like to get to know you first.” <br />
<br />
Another look over Jake’s body and Chris felt something wonderful. It was as though he’d known Jake for years or was remembering Jake. The love Chris now felt was difficult to deny.<br />
<br />
“Can I hug you?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Jake smiled. &quot;Of course you can. But first, let me dry off.&quot;<br />
<br />
A warm wind circled Jake. Within less then a minute, his fur was dry. Chris almost leapt at Jake. The embrace was wonderful. Jake’s fur was soft and warm. It only served to increase Chris' excitement. <br />
<br />
That Jake was a guy no longer bothered Chris. Something about Jake made feeling this way about a fellow male acceptable. Chris considered accepting Jake’s request to become female.<br />
<br />
Becoming an otter person was one thing. Having fur, a tail and maybe some facial differences would only entail minor lifestyle changes. <br />
<br />
Becoming female could change everything for Chris. Chris had female friends. He knew that even in an equal society, being female could change things in a way undesirable for Chris.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Chris loved Jake since somehow getting to know who Jake was. Maybe being with Jake would allay any sacrifices becoming an otter girl would entail.<br />
<br />
Jake put his arms around Chris. The desire to take this to another level was growing stronger by the second. A part of Chris was screaming to go for it, to let Jake turn Chris into a female otter.<br />
<br />
Chris had friends and family however that this would effect. Even as a male otter, he'd still be male. He could still maintain friendships. Of course, he could still do that as female, it would just be different even if such differences only existed in Chris’ head. Chris told Jake of his concerns after releasing the hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such worries are understandable,” Jake said. “While I do believe that one's gender should not affect potential friendships and life’s opportunities, I understand that the physical form indeed is something we cannot ignore.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;This is so embarrassing, I can't even control it, but you can,&quot; Chris said. &quot;You do like me right? Is it because I'm male right now that you're not excited?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In part, yes,&quot; Jake said. &quot;No, this does not mean that you, as you might say, swing that way. I assure you however that I want you as more then a friend. It’s you I like; what’s inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake pointed to Chris’ chest.<br />
<br />
“Asking you to become female in body will allow me to love you in ways that would be more difficult if you’re a male,” Jake said. “I would choose to become female, but the curse will not allow that.”<br />
<br />
Chris felt an itch that started on his chest but soon covered his entire body. He looked down to see fur similar to Jake' spreading over Chris' body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you causing this?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Jake shook his head. &quot;No, this is your own desire. What you want on the inside so to speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt his heart-rate accelerate as everything grew warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wish to remain male, we can still be friends, perhaps more,&quot; Jake said. “I won't force something on you that you don't want. However, I will make anything you might have to sacrifice to become female worth it if you chose that path.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Jake and then at his body. Fur had covered Chris' body and he felt the pressure of a tail growing. He seemed to be remaining male but there was a part of him that wanted to be female and to heck with the consequences if it meant truly being able to be with Jake in the way Jake wanted. Chris had just met Jake yet he felt as though he'd known Jake for years. A tingle went through Chris' manhood. It seemed that whatever was changing his body was about to decide his gender as an otter person.<br />
<br />
Then, the world seemed to grow hazy. Chris started realizing this was a dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're waking up,&quot; Jake said. &quot;I'll be there beside you when you awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake' voice seemed to grow quieter and more distant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, be who you are, not who you feel I want you to be,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
Everything went bright. <br />
<br />
Chris woke up.</p>
