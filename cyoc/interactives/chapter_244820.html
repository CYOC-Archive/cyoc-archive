<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘This is so fucked up,’ Jeff thinks to himself as he lies in the darkness of Ken’s backpack, the boy he had considered a friend, ‘if I’d known before, that Ken is such an evil person, I’d never would have befriended him! I should have canceled the friendship the day I found out he was a furry! At least he seems not to be one of those pedophiles, since his persona is a female… but I think being a fagot is just as worse!’<br />
<br />
Unaware to Jeff, Ken is listening to his thoughts, ‘I think I made the world a favor by getting rid of such an intolerant asshole,’ the teen thinks to himself, which Jeff is unable to hear. Ken smirks, ‘hehe… Jeff sure makes one fine costume,’ he thinks to himself, ‘his parents will no doubt file a missing person report, but after a few months the department will give up and write him off as a runaway who doesn’t want to be found! Haha… they’ll get over the “loss” and continue living their lives happily!’<br />
<br />
Arriving home Ken pulls the “costume” out of the backpack and grins at it as he holds it up, “welcome to your new home, Jeff,” he says, “I think you’ll enjoy “hanging around” here! Haha!”<br />
<br />
‘Fuck you, Ken,’ Jeff growls mentally.<br />
<br />
Ken’s grin widens, ignoring Jeff’s reply, he hangs the “costume” in his wardrobe before stepping back and tilting his head with a thoughtful expression on his face, “hm… the costume still doesn’t look realistic enough…,” he mumbles, then smiles, “instead of the shiny spandex, I want it to look more like real reptile skin, so… more leathery, and the scales should be more detailed and realistic!”<br />
<br />
The teen smiles as the “costume” quivers and the changes washing over it, “now we’re talking,” Ken says once the change has completed, “I’ll see you next Thursday when I pack for the convention, until then… enjoy,” with a laugh Ken closes the doors of the wardrobe, plunging Jeff into darkness.<br />
<br />
Ken walks over to his bed and lies on his back, grinning up at the ceiling and his hands behind his head, “this power is so awesome,” the 15-year-old says, “hehe… I can do so much good with it! Help people be what they really want to be, help them reach their full potential and show them their true purpose!”<br />
<br />
The teen decides to start with his neighbors, then his friends, then his family, fellow students, teachers, the principal… deciding to create a list with their names and what he believes is their “true purpose”.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the following days, Ken creates the list, and by Sunday, four days after transforming Jeff into the costume, Ken finally finishes the list, here are some names of the people and their “true purposes”:<br />
<br />
Tyler Baker, 12-year-old brother of Ken = Anthro Fox<br />
Janet Baker, mother = dress<br />
Mike Baker, dad = bronze statue<br />
Mr. Wolf, teacher = Anthro wolf<br />
Mrs. Young, teacher = anthro tiger<br />
Tony, friend = feral african rock python<br />
Nate, friend = pet puppy of Ken<br />
Kevin, friend of Tyler = female feral tiger<br />
Ben, friend of Tyler = dolphin pool-toy<br />
Quinn and Finn, twins, friends of Tyler = merge them into a mare<br />
Thomas, neighbor = tree<br />
Nicole, neighbor = fish<br />
Kenny, 10-year-old neighbor = merboy<br />
Nadine, 11-year-old neighbor = mermaid<br />
Gabby, girlfriend of Jeff = frozen turkey<br />
Gary, 13-year-old neighbor = anthro squirrel<br />
James, 14-year-old neighbor = toy car<br />
Amy, girlfriend of Ken = sex-doll<br />
<br />
and many more.<br />
<br />
Going through the list, Ken decides to start with his brother, “Tyler, come into my room for a minute,” he calls out.<br />
<br />
Shortly after the door to Ken’s room opens and his 12-year-old brother Tyler steps in, “what isit, bro,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Close the door,” Ken says.<br />
<br />
Tyler does as told before stepping closer, “have I done something,” the boy asks.<br />
<br />
“You haven’t done anything, Ty,” Ken says, “however, remember when you and I watched “Zootopia”, and you mentioned that you’d love to be a fox like Nick?”<br />
<br />
Tyler nods, “yeah? So?”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “what would you say, if I told you that I could make that happen?”<br />
<br />
Tyler blinks, “I’d say that you’re crazy,” he says, “as if you suddenly have magic powers!”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “then explain to me why a big red fox tail with a white tip is starting to grow from your back”.<br />
<br />
Tyler opens his mouth to say something when his eyes suddenly widen as he feels something tug on his back directly above his butt. The 12-year-old freezes when he feels whatever it is continue to grow and start to feel warm and fluffy, and when he feels the… thing swish back and forth, he slowly turns his head and lets out a eep when he notices the tail. “N-no fucking way,” the 12-year-old breaths before starting to strip out of his clothes, not seeming to care that his older brother is right there, to get a better look.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “convinced yet,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Tyler nods his head, staring at his tail, before turning back to look at his brother, “this… is… AWESOME,” he squeals, “what are you waiting for!? Come on, bro! Finish me off! Make me a fox-boy!”<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “well, foxes have red and white fur covering their bodies, big pointy ears, whiskers, a cute snout and golden slitted eyes!”<br />
<br />
Tyler gasps when he feels the changes wash over him, groaning when he feels his face push out into a muzzle, his teeth sharpening and his tongue lengthening, while fur grows from his body and his ears grow and migrate to the top of his head, his hair taking on the same color and texture as the fur.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “already looking the part, bro,” he says, “now, foxes have black claws and a sheath which houses their knotted cock!”<br />
<br />
Tyler lets out a moan when he feels his cock erect and change into a sheath, his moans increasing when he feels the head of his former cock grow and change shape, soon a knotted canine cock starts to slide from the sheath.<br />
<br />
“Wow, Ty,” Ken says once the changes have completed, “you really look cute… hehe and your cock has defiantly undergone one hell of an upgrade!”<br />
<br />
Tyler grins as he looks down at his new cock, his tail wagging happily behind him as he turns to look at himself in the mirror, “wow… thanks bro!”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome, Ty,” Ken says.<br />
<br />
Tyler turns back to his brother before walking over and giving him a hug, “thank you so, so much!”<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “damn… your fur sure is super soft… perfect for cuddles,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tyler grins, showing his new white teeth, “I wouldn’t mind cuddling with you, bro!”<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “maybe tonight, little fox,” he says, scratching behind one of his fox-brother’s ears.<br />
<br />
Tyler wags his tail as he closes his eyes and lets out a murr, “damn… that feels… nice”.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “so cute and adorable,” he says, giving his brother a kiss on his moist black nose, causing Tyler to giggle, “now, why doesn’t the little foxy show off his new and improved body to his friends?”<br />
<br />
Tyler grins, “good idea! Hehe… they won’t recognize me,” he says before getting off of Ken’s lap, “hey… would you help my friends too?”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “I’d be happy too,” he says, “however, I decide what best suits them and you will be okay with anything I choose”.<br />
<br />
Tyler doesn’t notice the atmosphere tingle as Ken’s command takes affect and simply nods his head, “of course, Ken,” he says, “do whatever you feel is right!”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “oh, I will,” he says, “why don’t you call them over?”<br />
<br />
Tyler wags his tail, “sure, let me do that,” he says, hurrying out of Ken’s room, not bothered to put on his clothes.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “this is going to be fun,” he says to himself.</p>
