<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um...&quot; Rachel started as she tried not to stare at Aaron too much.  &quot;Are you and Megumi related? I heard you say that she&#39;s your little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not exactly,&quot; Aaron said, &quot;She&#39;s actually more like a cousin.  We have different parents, but they came from our grandmother Akane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see,&quot; Rachel said softly, &quot;That makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Megumi&#39;s parents are a bit more traditional while mine, well, wanted me to integrate more with American culture.  That&#39;s why I have a more American sounding name while Megumi&#39;s is more Japanese.&quot;  Aaron then moved closer to Rachel and asked, &quot;So, Megumi&#39;s been telling you about werefoxes?  Learning what you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Rachel said, suddenly aware of how close Aaron was standing, &quot;Yeah.  I&#39;m, um, thinking about becoming one.&quot;  She brushed her hair away from her ear as she looked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that right?&quot; Aaron said with a rather wry grin.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Rachel responded.  &quot;Um...can I ask you things about being a werefox?  From a guy&#39;s perspective?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron shrugged and said, &quot;Sure, I guess.  Want to talk about it in my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok...&quot; Rachel said, with a grin forming on her face.  She followed Aaron through the mansion to his room and followed him through the door, closing the door behind her.  She could feel her heart beating quickly as she bit her lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to know?&quot; Aaron asked as he sat on his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Rachel said as she thought about her question.  &quot;Um...Megumi showed what her werefox...err...werevixen form looked like.  Would you be...err...want to...um...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron chuckled at how bashful Rachel was asking, and then he stood up as he finished her question.  &quot;You want to see what I look like as a werefox?&quot;  Rachel nodded as her face flushed red.  &quot;Well, all right then.&quot;  He stood up and pulled his shirt off.  Rachel bit her lip as she examined his chest with her eyes.  She could see that he was quite muscular, but not quite bulky.  His shoulders were rather broad, and her eyes trailed down his chest towards his abs.  By Rachel&#39;s judgment, he would definitely be considered &quot;hot&quot;.  He pulled down his pants and underwear, leaving himself naked before her.  Her eyes were glued to what was between his legs.  He saw her staring at him and he said, &quot;Like what you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um,&quot; Rachel said as she tried to look away.  &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to stare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite all right,&quot; he said with a bit of a chuckle.  He closed his eyes as his transformation started.  Red fur covered most of his body as white fur covered his front.  Black fur covered his hands and feet as they turned into paws.  His feet stretched out, and he took a similar stance as Megumi did when she was a werefox.  His face grew out into a muzzle as his ears traveled to the top of his head and became pointed.  His ears grew red fur but topped by black fur.  Rachel could see his tail growing out his back, and similar to Megumi&#39;s was covered in red fur with a bit of white fur on the tip.  Aaron opened his eyes, and Rachel could see that they turned red as well.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; was all Rachel could say as she approached Aaron.  Her hand brushed through the white fur on his chest.  She could feel the softness of his fur and at the same time, the hardness of his muscle beneath the fur.  She could feel the muscle twitch as her hand brushed that part of his body.  She looked down to notice that Aaron&#39;s balls seemed to be a bit bigger than his normal form and his penis was hidden by a sheath.  Her hands traveled down his front and she had to resist the temptation to feel his sheath.  &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; she asked as she looked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Aaron said.  There seemed to be a bit of amusement on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megumi said that werefoxes have an instinct for um...you know...sex...and um...pleasure...&quot; Rachel tried to mutter out.<br />
<br />
Aaron chuckled and said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s true.  We do know instinctually what turns our partner on and give them great pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Rachel said slowly.  Rachel bit her lip as she thought about her next question.  &quot;Could...could you show me?&quot; Rachel as she pulled on the hem of her shirt.<br />
<br />
Aaron raised an eyebrow as he held her arm.  &quot;Are you sure about that?  I mean, if we start, it might not end until...you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I know,&quot; Rachel said, her eyes adverted.  &quot;And...I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind.  I mean...being a werefox...werevixen...is one of my choices.&quot;  She looked up at his red eyes, &quot;And we can stop if we want...you know...before things get too far.  We don&#39;t have to have sex, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Aaron said as he studied Rachel, &quot;There are things we could do without going that far.  But I need you to relax and trust me.  Can you do that?&quot;  <br />
<br />
She nodded as she said, &quot;I guess I can do that much.  Just don&#39;t change me into a werefox or make me pregnant or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron smiled and said, &quot;I think I can manage that.&quot;  He walked behind her as he put his paws on her hips.  &quot;One of the gifts of being a werefox is we know what it takes to make our partners feel pleasure.  Not just to those who we are bonded with, but anyone we want to get intimate with.&quot;  Rachel could feel Aaron&#39;s paws travel up the sides of her body as he said that.  &quot;For example,&quot; he whispered into her ear softly.  &quot;If I do this...&quot; his paws traveled to her breasts, and gently rubbed her nipples from the outside of her shirt.<br />
<br />
She gasped as he did this.  The more he massaged her breasts, the more pleasure seemed to grow inside her.  &quot;Oh...ooooh,&quot; she moaned, &quot;That...feels so...good...&quot;  Aaron smiled as he moved his paws.  One paw went up to her neck and he gently scraped a claw down the nape of her neck, sending goosebumps on Rachel&#39;s skin.  His other paw went down to her waist and started to pull her shirt up.  Rachel smiled as she lifted her arms up, allowing him to lift her shirt up off of her.  Afterward, Rachel undid her ponytail, shaking her loose as she smiled at him.  &quot;You know, I&#39;ve never let a guy see my breasts before.  I know they&#39;re a bit small, especially compared to...&quot;<br />
<br />
He put a clawed finger to her mouth to let her be quiet as he said, &quot;Shh...it&#39;s not the size that matters.  And you&#39;re still cute even as a normal.&quot;  Rachel blushed and smiled at him as she reached behind her to unfasten her bra and let it fall to the ground.  He picked her up and carried her to his bed.  Her breasts bounced a little as she settled herself in his bed, and then he climbed on top of her.  The two teens stared at each other before he got on top of her and started to lick her neck.  Rachel moaned when he did this.  It wasn&#39;t just his tongue on her skin, but the feel of his fur against her.  Every time he moved, his fur would brush up against her skin, and to Rachel, this felt very erotic.  Her hands moved down his back to his waist.  Her hands hit a spot just above his tail, and she could feel something hard trying to thrust into her crotch.  The two teens separated and looked at each other, breathing hard.  The two of them were so into it that at this point, they were both acting on instinct.  Rachel looked down his body and saw that his penis was completely erect out of its sheath.  The two of them flipped over so that she was on top of him.  Her hands went down his chest to his stomach and finally to the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful,&quot; he said as her hands started to feel his penis. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Rachel said as she withdrew her hands, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I guess I got a little too much into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Aaron responded as he put his paws on her hands.  &quot;This is fine,&quot; he said as he put her hands back on his penis, &quot;Just don&#39;t give me a blowjob or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; she said as his paws guided her hands.  She let his paws show her how to rub his penis, going from the head down to his shaft.  She noticed just how hot and hard his shaft was as she rubbed it up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh, that&#39;s nice.  Just keep doing that,&quot; he said as he let go of her hands.  He started to feel his own pleasure growing as he felt her hands moving up and down on his shaft.  &quot;Just keep rubbing the head...ah...yeah...that&#39;s the way.&quot;  As soon as he said that, he returned his paws to Rachel&#39;s body, rubbing her breasts and pinching her nipples.  When he did that, Rachel started to moan again.  At this point both teens were acting on instinct as Rachel kept moving her hands up and down his shaft while he rubbed her breasts and nipples.  Rachel could feel something inside of her building as the pleasure grew inside her body.  Her hands increased their pace as she continued to rub his penis.  It wasn&#39;t long before she gave a long moan as her body shook in pleasure.  Soon after, at almost the same time, Aaron started to groan as he reached the point of no return, and knew he was going to cum soon.</p>
