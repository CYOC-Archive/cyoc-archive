<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh turned to leave the bathroom, when suddenly the door swung open. She paused in fear and tried to cover her newfound breasts and vagina up with her hands, when she saw Eric standing there with a smirk on his face. &quot;Hello Josh,&quot; he said with almost a sinister tone to his voice. &quot;I see you finally found the potions I left downstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...what do you mean?&quot; Josh asked hesitantly, although her intuition was telling her to run away as fast as she could. Eric merely stood there, continuing to smirk at her, blocking her way out the door. Her eyes drifted down towards the Eric's hand, and she saw something there that made her freeze in place. He was holding a small plastic cup, and inside it was more of the neon pink liquid that had gotten her into this situation to begin with. &quot;But...I thought I drank all of that!&quot; she exclaimed, pointing at the cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those vials are magic,&quot; Eric explained, glancing down at the liquid. &quot;They refill themselves after they are drained. I don't know how they work, and frankly I don't care. It'll give me what I want.&quot; Quickly, and before Josh could fight back, Eric rushed at her. He forcefully pushed Josh against the wall and tilted her head back. She tried in vain to fight back against him, flailing her arms about desperately, but to no avail. Within seconds he had forced her mouth open, and forced the contents of the plastic cup down. She tried to spit it out, but he violently massaged her throat, forcing her to swallow most of it, if not all of it. He backed away as she started coughing crumbling to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did you do to me!&quot; Josh exclaimed, already having half of an idea of what was about to happen to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry it had to be this way Josh,&quot; Eric explained, &quot;But I needed a girlfriend desperately, and this was the quickest way to find one. Speaking of which...we can't have a hot girlfriend without a hot boy to go with it.&quot; Josh felt a heat start to rise within her, as she helplessly watched as Eric took another cup from his pocket. He unscrewed the cap and downed the contents, the small dark blue liquid leaking out an indication of what was inside. That done, Eric proceeded to strip off his shirt and pants, leaving him standing there in the nude in front of her, his cock at full attention. Involuntarily her eyes drifted down to his admittedly unimpressive member, and she quickly turned her gaze away when she realized what she was doing. Her breathing grew more shallow, and she felt the heat within her continued to rise. A tingling began to wash over her, and she gasped in pleasure as her hands began to caress over her body. She could feel her breasts get bigger in her hands, and the feelings of pleasure continued to course through her body, culminating in another monumental female orgasm.<br />
<br />
Breathing deeply, she stood up and wary legs and marveled at the image of feminine beauty she had become. Her breasts were mammoth size, akin to beach balls hanging on her chest, and her long blonde hair now hung halfway passed her plump rear end. Her face had a look of innocence on it, but one that belied the face of someone with a slutty side just waiting to come out. There was little, if anything, left of the old Josh inside the way she looked. A groan to the side reminded her that she was not alone.<br />
<br />
She was instantly floored by the changes in Eric. He had gone from a nerdy, somewhat pudgy young male into a modern day Adonis. His fat had been exicsed away, left with chiseled muscle behind it. His face was gorgeously handsome, and he stood almost near seven feet tall. She couldn't help but lick her lips when her eyes drifted down to his new enormous cock. The former organ had been a mere three and a half inches fully erect before. Now it was over a titanic foot and a half fully erect, sitting atop balls the size of oranges. She gazed up at Eric, who's smirk had become far more confident and predatory in his transformation. Inside her mind, Josh screamed against the actions his body was taking, but apparently through the magic of the potion she had been given, she was helpless when Eric took her in his arms and forcefully shoved his erect dick into her. She gave a muffled scream at the sudden intrusion, but began to moan in pleasure as he pistoned in and out of her, laying her on the floor of the bathroom for easier penetration. For several minutes they rocked back and forth together, before they both reached climax simultaneously.<br />
<br />
The collapsed in each other's arms, while the inner voice of Josh continued to rant and rave against what had happened, in her mind at least.</p>
