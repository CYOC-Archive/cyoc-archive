<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Possession!&quot;<br />
After the familiar flash of light he felt a familiar warmth and a familiar silence in his head. This body, it felt like coming home. Even if the world seemed less bright, less alive, somehow the sense of loss was dulled by a feeling of being where he should be. A feeling of home.<br />
He smiled, before he remembered his whole reason for coming on this quest in the first place. He needed to fix his home&#39;s plumbing.<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Vivian asked.<br />
&quot;They say a man&#39;s body is his castle. Well, I&#39;m home.&quot; <br />
He never knew eye rolling could make noise, but he was certain he heard Andrea rolling them hard. No matter, he was who he was. <br />
A confused kitten mewed on the table. Vivian patted it on the head. &quot;I guess we have a pet now.&quot;<br />
He got up and froze. Something felt different. He couldn&#39;t quite place his finger on it. He jumped and stretched for a bit.<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, just checking if everything works. Seems like your guess of a break from the world is correct. I don&#39;t feel hungry, nor thirsty. Just tired.&quot; He stretched some more, he couldn&#39;t find it. But something was definitely different though.<br />
&quot;Oh right, you took the body before we...went to sleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh, if I may interrupt this interesting exchange. We should leave this place, the air is getting thicker. The knight may have been correct. Besides, we have men to track down.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry Andrea, I can&#39;t come with you yet. I know we have our duty towards the rest, but I promised Alec I was going to help him with his v..&quot; &quot;ery annoying curse.&quot; Alec interrupted. &quot;I was cursed by a witch and I came here for ingredients and to help Vivian.&quot; He quickly added.<br />
Andrea raised an eyebrow. &quot;Really? Is that why you look like this?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, as long I don&#39;t have to change any diapers. So what ingredients did you need from this swamp?&quot;<br />
Oh god, was she offering to help as well? Also, diapers what? &quot;I need four ingredients. I&#39;m supposed to find Dickweed and some Honking frogs here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dickweed and Honking frogs? okay, and when you say &#39;here&#39;, I assume you need more ingredients next to those?&quot;<br />
He nodded &quot;Ball herbs and Minotaur milk.&quot;<br />
She smirked. &quot;You&#39;re either being taken for a fool by your wizard quest giver , planning for a fun party or you&#39;re looking for a sex change.&quot;<br />
He was sure he heard Vivian snicker, but she seemed to be fully focused on playing with her new pet. Alec was about to protest when Andrea held up a finger. &quot;I do not need to know which. I will help you as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crap! &quot;That&#39;s...very kind? But I think the men need your help as well?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can use Vivian&#39;s help finding and saving the men and I owe you as well. I will help.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I think Vivian and I can handle this, Right Vivian?&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;d be happy to have Andrea along. She&#39;s much better at herbs and magic than me.&quot;<br />
&quot;It is decided then. We shall look for your frogs first, the dickweeds can be found near the edge of the swamp.&quot;<br />
They made a brief stop at the equipment shed where they picked up Andrea&#39;s light armor. She&#39;d fully transformed back her normal self as far as Alec could judge at least. <br />
Her tanned and toned body was quite impressive for a magic user. But once fully kitted out, to Alec, she just really looked like a boy wizard who dressed up as a girl adventurer. She didn&#39;t carry much except a short sword on one hip and some wands tried around her other leg. She claimed the witch had taken the wands from her.<br />
Conversely, Vivian was still clearly sporting additional breasts as well as being quite short.<br />
Andrea did at least show her immediate worth by applying a swamp creature ward on Alec and reminding him to bring some jars before they left for the ingredients. <br />
Vivian meanwhile constructed a pouch for her Nekomata pet. With the Nekomata strapped to her front, she followed the rest. &quot;Let&#39;s go Neka!&quot;<br />
<br />
It took only about an hour before he heard an oddly familiar noise he never expected to hear here. &quot;Is there a traffic jam here in the swamp? Do you even have cars?&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a car?&quot;<br />
&quot;What you hear are the honking frogs. They are easily recognized for their annoyingly loud noise. They use them to scare off predators and find mates.&quot;<br />
Pushing through the foliage they stumble upon a murky pond surrounded by thick weeping willows. The putrid smell of rotten leaves drifts from the sludge that pretended to be water. Mosquito&#39;s danced around above the sludge while the occasional lightning fast bright red tongue shot through the air. <br />
You only had to follow the tongue to find the frogs perched on the edge of the pond. Their fat bulbous bodies made them stick out well enough despite their colors. Their most distinctive feature being the two fat fleshy orbs on their heads. <br />
They looked like the image Alec had seen at the wizard&#39;s office, but here now seeing them in motion in the flesh the orbs on their heads reminded him of something. But he couldn&#39;t quite place it.<br />
The noise they made sounded like all the worst drivers in his previous world had decided to come together to furiously honk their car horns at the same time at each other. The sound was deafening.<br />
Neka held her ears down while Vivian held her hands over them. &quot;I&#39;m going to fall back a bit, this isn&#39;t dangerous and Neka doesn&#39;t like it so you don&#39;t need me.&quot;<br />
Alec nodded and stepped from the bushes to the edge. From the corner of his eye he noticed Andrea preparing a jar with some water and some leaves. <br />
Immediately he spotted a fat frog at his feet and slowly bend over. He heard Andrea shout something behind him, her voice drowned out by the deafening honking from the frogs.<br />
He quickly snatched the fat sluggish creature from the ground, surprising himself that he managed it in a single go. <br />
However, the fat creature was less than enthused. It panicked and started thrashing in his hand, it&#39;s slimy skin allowed it to slip free. But Alec nimbly managed to catch it in the rebound, surprising himself again at his own agility.<br />
He proudly turned around to a look from Andrea that seemed to straddle the line between shock and annoyance. <br />
Andrea moved fast as lightning and quickly contained the frog in a jar, before pulling him from the pond into the relative quiet.<br />
&quot;What are you doing, you fool!&quot; She held a cloth in her hands and brushed his hands vigorously.<br />
&quot;What? What did I do?&quot; Alec panicked. &quot;They&#39;re not poisonous? Are they poisonous? Am I going to die? Quick, heal me!&quot; <br />
&quot;No, you are not going to die you fool. And cure is for poison. Now hold still.&quot; She moved her hands over his open palms. &quot;Cure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what? You said no poison and still cast cure!&quot; He felt a strange pressure in his chest, the pressure turned to pain. &quot;Help me! It hurts!&quot; He pulled his hands back from Andrea and clutched his chest. Something was soft pushing outward, growing from nothing slowly into soft bumps. Slowly pushing out even further, easily filling his hands and spilling even further. The pain held, the growth of his chest continued. His shirt was getting tight, it was pulling painfully against his shoulders. Andrea brandished her knife and expertly cut the seams at his sides. His shirt kept pushing outward. <br />
Finally, the pain stopped and to his distress Alec felt an oddly familiar weight on his chest. It reminded him of his time in Vivian&#39;s body, except both less and heavier, much heavier.<br />
Alec looked down, he looked like he had a huge belly. His shirt was pushed outward far before and to the sides of him, the fabric was pulled taut even with the opened seams. Hesitantly he pulled on his collar to look inside his shirt. Stuck on his chest were two huge hairless breasts, easily reaching to hips and resting on his lap as he sat on the ground. <br />
&quot;Oh my god! What the hell is this!&quot; He jumped and quickly grabbed his huge heavy breasts to stop them from jumping with them.<br />
Andrea pulled on Alec&#39;s hand, pulling him further from the noise until it was only a soft background noise. Vivian quickly joined them again and kept her face impressively straight.<br />
&quot;They are called Honking Frogs, but at the academy we called them Honkers Frogs. They are not technically dangerous, but the slime on their skin can cause any creature to develop large mammary glands. Size is partially dependent on the period of contact with the slime. They are a hoot at frat parties. You needed to get them and did not know that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Alec touched his new breasts through his taut shirt. &quot;I grew tits? Can you fix this?&quot; He looked at her pleadingly. He was a guy with tits and a vagina, all he needed was some childbearing hips and he&#39;d be a full on girl! &quot;If I wanted to be a girl he would&#39;ve stayed inside the Nekomata!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but not here, not now and it is really not necessary.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean &#39;not necessary&#39;?! It&#39;s very important to me that these&quot; He clutched his tits and shivered at their sensitivity, &quot;go away fast.&quot;<br />
&quot;Calm down. The toxin wears off by itself. Usually after a day. I cleaned your hands and the cure should cut the duration further.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn Alec, those are some impressive tits.&quot;<br />
&quot;I trust that you two will behave while I&#39;m still here. You are not traveling alone anymore.&quot; Andrea said, throwing a stern look at Vivian, &quot;but Vivian is right. I too am impressed by the size you still this well developed even after I cleansed your hands and used a cure. You seem to have a high sensitivity for this, so it might be longer than a day.&quot;<br />
Alec pictured himself pinned by his breasts at the edge of the pond while Vivian had her way with him and for the first time he was happy Andrea was here with them.<br />
&quot;I shall get another frog for you, you just stay here before you hurt yourself.&quot; Andrea pushed through the bushes and back to the pond.<br />
&quot;You know, I bet Andrea would find you having a vagina very relevant to the size of your breasts. You should tell her.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t feel comfortable enough around her to tell her that yet.&quot; He looked down at the heavy orbs of flesh resting on his stomach. He had the biggest tits he&#39;d ever seen.<br />
&quot;Your call, I won&#39;t tell her. Do you want me to fix you up a bra, I&#39;m an expert at home made breast support.&quot;<br />
Alec groaned. He was really not in the mood for this. He was not wearing a bra. &quot;No thanks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Take it from a woman who had 6 large ones, having support is nice. Not everyone can pull off going commando unless you&#39;re more in Andrea&#39;s size class. I wonder if she&#39;s jealous.&quot;<br />
