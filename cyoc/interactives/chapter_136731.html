<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a month since you changed your life with the Chronovac, and so far you couldn&#39;t really see any flaws, it was like a perfect dream in reality. How that moment went from finding the interesting option to become a detachable body part, the enigmatic thoughts and images that when through your head like a rocket blasting into space without knowing what new adventures that awaits it. Not only that you could remain mostly human, but still could fuse with animals given their permission. You clicked enter not really feeling that this thing was as real as it said it was. You then woke up to see that the universe around you changed and your memories, though still keeping your memories from before.<br />
<br />
You were different, you felt different. You were still human but yet acted as a body part. Not knowing how it worked you soon realized somethings about your transformation. First was you were born without an anus, or genitalia. The doctors were baffled when they tried to run some tests on your impossible body. They found you had no reproduction organs, and you only had a mouth, an esophagus, and stomach for your digestive system. They wondered how were you to digest food. They found out that night, when you puked out your first turd into your crib. It turns out that you could digest food, but not normally, the doctors learned that when food is digested your stomach condenses and turns into intestines which sends it out your mouth, and with urine from your nose. Of course there&#39;s a second tube connecting your stomach and not connected with your lungs. Your parents said that you would use a special kind of diaper before you were toilet trained. In pictures that you remember, it looked like a diaper covering a baby&#39;s face, which made you look more like a bottom than a top. Second, you could become an animal&#39;s body part, and also humans, but that&#39;s not so interesting. Your parents first realized this when they couldn&#39;t find you anywhere in the house, you were 18 months old. They say your pajamas, and diaper was just lying on the floor, but they didn&#39;t find it all peculiar at first glance. Your dad said, that the dog, who was a big Bernese mountain dog named Trigger, wanted to go for a walk. Your dad then went for a walk, but then Trigger did his business on a lawn a couple houses from there. When your dad picked the excrement he heard crying of a baby. He immediately looked around for the noise when he felt it coming from the dog, which he imagined he had eaten you for some reason. He moved closer to his stomach, however he heard the progressive cry coming from his rear. He lifted his tail up and saw that you had taken the form of Trigger&#39;s tail hole. You still had eyes, and a mouth which didn&#39;t resemble a pucker at all. It was a baby&#39;s mouth crying for attention. Imagine his embarrassment and trying to tell your mom what new trick the dog could do. You were the dog tail hole for about 3 weeks, bonding with your pet sort of speak, to their surprise you seem to enjoy it. Of course your parents didn’t want to mention this to anybody, who couldn’t blame them since it wasn’t everyday that a semi normal baby turns into the family pet’s anus. You seemed to learn how to bark as Trigger’s anus, and Trigger seemed to understand you being there. He rarely sat down, for the first time he did you wouldn’t stop crying. You were both best of friends given the circumstances you still were able to have a friendship with a thing that squeezed slimy shit out of you. One day you returned to normal just like that, and your parents first thought that you can release yourself when you feel like it, later it was realized that only the animals themselves can release you. You did ask them what was the first time you transformed into a dick, and they always declined your question. Third is that you can communicate to animals just by talking. Finally learning how to speak you could talk to Trigger, being kind of by his side everyday, knowing his needs and wants all the time was just priceless. You could also find that in order to become a part of them the animal has to say it&#39;s alright to join them. You found out by trying to become your stuffed giraffe&#39;s tail hole when you felt sad it could never eat, of course it couldn’t agree since it was lifeless. You would then befriend any animal that moved. Either becoming a cat’s pussy for the day, or a horse’s junk for a week or so. Even one time to escape school and home, you turned into a cow’s butt for an entire month. You remembered it maternally love, and how you sometimes visit her from time to time. Though when you turn into a penis, you still have eyes, and a mouth, but if you close your eyes, you look like any regular penis. Same goes when you’re a pussy. Mostly you like being an ass hole more, it’s just fun to look around at something then the ground when you’re a penis or vagina. With your memories you couldn’t tell what was from your old life and the life you lived right now. <br />
<br />
Anyway, you woke up and felt the need to relieve yourself. You stood up and went for the bathroom. You instinctively opened the toilet lid up and pushed your head in and began to poop. What the weird thing about being like this when you do go to the bathroom, which is regularly, your taste buds change into an anus and you can taste all the stuff you’ve eaten earlier, which is better and fortunate than tasting shit all the time. You continued and then pushed the piss out your nose. You flushed and went onto the brushing your teeth and rinsing it with mouthwash. You usually have to do it longer than anyone else since you don’t want to smell like a butt, it’s just not polite. You run through this routine every time you use the bathroom, so your teeth has shown no cavities after all these years. You finish and spit the last of the brown gunk into the sink.<br />
<br />
It’s Saturday, and with no school to attend you like to just run around the neighborhood for most the day. You walk down the stairs and go into the kitchen. As you open the fridge your mouth begins to water feeling your regular taste buds begin to activate, you make some jam and toast and some milk to wash it down. You’re about to sit down and watch some t.v. with your sister when you’re dog Trigger comes over to tell you he wants a walk. He’s pretty old now, given you’ve known him since a baby. But with a boy like you, you can’t just take him on a walk like normal people do. You like doing it the fun way. Even you’re family is used to it now you like to do transformations in private so you sneak into your room where you transform him into his tail hole. It used to take a couple of long awkward minutes to finish the transformation from there and back. Now it takes only a couple seconds. You also just strip down, since you don’t like your clothes laying on the floor, it’s a little sloppy for your sake.<br />
<br />
You found yourself in your regular environment, a long shaggy tail wagging above, two furry legs moving a short, brisk movement depending on Trigger’s mood, and everything moving backwards without anyway of stopping was something you got use to. You could only sit back and just let your dog go for a walk. Your sister knew the drill and open the front door and let both of you loose into the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
“Now, remember to pee in the grass and not flowers, and don’t shit anywhere except the sewer drain. I trust you though, just want to tell you before you run off doing things that might get us both in trouble.” You spoke out, still able to use your mouth to talk. Well at least it would be a mouth in your perspective. You also can’t be understood by humans by talking to animals.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, master. I know the rules, I’ll keep them if you say so. How about we take a nice scenic route, does that sound fine?” He asked, still waddling down the street without any supervision. <br />
<br />
You guys eventually went down a few blocks, and after marking a couple of fence posts and sometimes garbage cans, he started to wag his tail a lot faster. You could tell by this he sees something. Feeling his breathing and heartbeat, it was perhaps another dog. As he began to walk slowly a large grey snout came into view of your sight, and it was a great dane call Max. He sniffed you and smiled. <br />
<br />
“You smell just lovely today boy.” He commented. You at first tried telling him your name, but he never cared to call you that. You just giggled with delight.<br />
<br />
“That’s high praise coming from you, you’re like a booty connoisseur.” You said.<br />
<br />
“I’m very picky on who to sniff,” Which he was, “but you always seem to be on point every time. Now I felt like I smelled you on a stray cat the other day. I couldn’t find out since she ran away from me before I got to chance?” <br />
<br />
“You mean Isabelle, she’s a tough one to be around. It took me awhile to convince her for me to become a part of her. She’s nice once you get to know her, but yeah, I played as her pussy the other day.”<br />
<br />
“She had a nice scent, so when you see her again, tell her I said hi.” He started to stop sniffing.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I won’t think she would care at all. You do know cats are much more different than dogs right.”<br />
<br />
“They, can’t be all that different. Anyway, my owner’s telling it’s time to go so I’ll be off. See you two later.” He said and walked off forward from your view.<br />
<br />
“Man, I can’t stand him. He’s too posh for me.” Trigger said a little disgusted. <br />
<br />
“He’s not so bad, he’s pretty nice once you get to know him.” Well it would seem since you did become his plush cock for mating one time.<br />
<br />
“He never gives me attention when I’m not with you.” He commented. We started to head back home.</p>
