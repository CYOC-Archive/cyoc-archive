<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was fairly calm as he walked along with Connor after school. There were afternoon bus routes, and some kids did ride them, but for the most part many, and weres in particular often walked home after school as they weren&#39;t being rushed for time. Those that didn&#39;t walk home at the end of the day either had a car of their own that they drove or were with the football team and were headed to practice for the Thanksgiving Day game. But Ryan had never really had much interest in it, largely because when the game was tackle football, the werewolves, werelions, weretigers, werehorses, werebears, and werecattle might get a bit too enthusiastic about tackling or blocking and Ryan, as a werewildcat would never be big enough to handle that. He&#39;d heard some rumors that the game this year would be flag football, but that really didn&#39;t change too much.<br />
<br />
Though there were a few things that puzzled Ryan a bit. Namely Connor&#39;s asking if he would turn him. That came out of the blue and puzzled him in many ways. Now, such questions often did come up, particularly with new residents to Moon Lake and that did make some degree of sense. After all, if one wanted to be a were, the best way to go about the conversion process was to ask. Ryan knew that the city might often help new resident families go through the process of joining were society, particularly if they didn&#39;t already know a were that matched their choice. But he also knew that werecats and werewildcats were something of a potential crossroads because of the fact that both were mono-gendered and both were at least bisexual if not homosexual. It was something that had lead Moon Lake to essentially funnel new residents that were already bisexual or homosexual to werecats and werewildcats because the sexuality aspects of their strains of the were-virus wouldn&#39;t effect the person. And sometimes those people learned about werecats and werewildcats and jumped at the prospect because their sexualities matched.<br />
<br />
And that could mean that maybe Connor was already gay or at least bisexual, but Ryan also knew that most people who were that way were usually pretty open about it. Especially in Moon Lake where same sex marriage had been tolerated since the town&#39;s founding or shortly thereafter, Ryan couldn&#39;t remember exactly when the first werecats and werewildcats came to Moon Lake. But through the course of the day, while Ryan and Connor didn&#39;t have the exact same schedule, Ryan was still able to observe that Connor did pay some attention to Moon Lake High&#39;s females. Though some of that might just be part of Connor trying to figure out what were they were or if they were a were. It only furthered some of Ryan&#39;s questions on where Connor was actually coming from, but he wasn&#39;t going to force anything along.<br />
<br />
&quot;The park is nice,&quot; Connor spoke as he followed Ryan into it as they walked along the straight street from the high school and into the park that made up the very center of Moon Lake. &quot;Odd that it&#39;s all broken up by streets going through it... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that reflects Moon Lake&#39;s ways of playing to its local population,&quot; Ryan answered, &quot;larger weres... like Tad and Amy as werewolves will want areas where they can hunt. Which often means there needs to be something that would attract prey animals like deer in. A normal city&#39;s grid formation, though, would seriously limit that as deer wouldn&#39;t stay in the region for long because they can&#39;t hide. So, the town has the wagon wheel layout to allow for the forested areas between the spokes. The forest will let deer move it and then bigger predatory weres can hunt them. The park here in the center of town provides a sort of similar aesthetic for some of the smaller weres and those that live in some of the apartments and smaller homes toward the central areas of town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might still make shipping things in and out if you aren&#39;t already familiar with the layout,&quot; Connor commented as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably more something that would relate to knowing the town already,&quot; Ryan answered, &quot;drop me down in New York City with no map and tell me to go to a specific street corner... and I may not be able to get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor shrugged, as that made some sense. Which supposed that made some things rather interesting with regard to learning about the town and he accepted that as he walked along with Connor. They continued on quietly until they had successfully managed to get onto the &quot;spoke&quot; that lead directly to where the Ross family and the Chang family lived. As they did so, Ryan decided to ask a few of his questions as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what did you think on your first day?&quot; Ryan asked, &quot;figure out who&#39;s a were and so on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I figured out some general rule on who might be a were or not,&quot; Connor admitted, thinking back to meeting Eric Anderson during his first period class largely grateful that Moon Lake, like many of the other schools he&#39;d taken, seemed to shuffle math classes around as though one wasn&#39;t a prerequisite to another, &quot;though... I&#39;d still wonder on what drives all the females to be big and busty while males are more muscular and I&#39;d imagine well built as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that is probably some element to inspire weres to make new weres,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;like when my mom feel in love with my dad. He was attracted to her and when she came into heat... that then lead to me. In that sense it&#39;s more of a natural process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Conner looked over to him, &quot;I can get that... but there seems to be so little variation between weres. I mean with those that are in our grade... it&#39;s like all the female weres start at a D cup and the only variance is how much bigger they get. My mom isn&#39;t that big. And even some of the prettier actresses in the movies or on TV aren&#39;t that big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh… that,&quot; Ryan said slowly, &quot;that there, I&#39;m not sure there is a real answer. Those that are more mystical, &quot;magical,&quot; or spiritual in their beliefs would argue that whoever created the were-virus engineered it that way because he or she was a pervert. The scientific explanation might be more that between a naturally high libido and the dietary needs of young weres while they&#39;re infants... that that sort of build is necessary to ensure that infant weres get the nutrients they need to live. And in terms of conception... female weres may combine certain things with their animal side in a way that would require a lot of that extra stimulation to assure ovulation and thus pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor gave a low whistle as he walked along. He glanced to the buildings and houses he walked by, and actually marveled at some of them. Some of them looked like they were of much older designs and some even looked like they might have been built in the 1800s rather than in the modern era as so many suburbs seemed to. But yet the buildings looked not only well maintained but extremely well maintained, as though they hadn&#39;t been worn down by erosion or weathering or anything like that. In his momentary lapse of attention he failed to notice Ryan looking down for a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for offering to help think through all these decisions,&quot; Connor then spoke bringing the topic back things that were more at hand for him and making Ryan look up.<br />
<br />
Ryan looked up quickly finding that Connor was only just turning his head, which meant that Connor didn&#39;t notice him looking down. There was a part of Ryan that was rather interested in Connor. Part of it was that he&#39;d never really found anyone outside of some of his father&#39;s pride meetings, and that had largely just been sex. Part of it was some of the occasional lines that Connor gave that made him wonder if Connor was at least bisexual, like his father was. Part of it was also the fact that Ryan also found Connor rather cute, but for the moment he was bit too shy to come out and say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... Tad helped... but a lot of this is so huge and new,&quot; Connor spoke, &quot;I really don&#39;t want to make a mistake on something I can&#39;t take back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;we&#39;re almost to my house... um... do you need call your folks about this... or with regard to your sister or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh…&quot; Connor almost visibly paled at that. &quot;Well... I could tell them what we&#39;re up to... but I really don&#39;t know what Ava&#39;s up to. She&#39;d have to tell them on her own...&quot;</p>
