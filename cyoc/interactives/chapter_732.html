<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max felt a tingle in the middle of his chest, he reached up to rub it and found the medallion first, Max pushed the medallion out of the way and rubbed the deep
<br>
 valley between his mighty pecs, the burning feeling seemed to spread outward from the center of his broad pecs and Max spread his fingers out and with the palm
<br>
 of his hand held flatly against his hairy chest he rubbed both of his well muscled pecs, the burning seemed to diminish with his rubbing. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 Max rubbed his chest till the burning stoped, he reach down and pulled the medallion away from his chest and brought it as far from his chest as the chain it hung on
<br>
 would let it, Max looked at it with a puzzeled look, it was dirty but it was just surface dirt, it was apperently made of some kind of metal that could conduct body
<br>
 heat because it felt warm to the touch, Max kept it away from his chest as he walked over and picked up one of the child sized pairs of underwear and began to
<br>
 clean the medallion off with it! 
<br>

<br>
 The medallion cleaned up quite nicely, it had a low luster meatallic sheen to it, Max figured it was either silver or pewter, and apperently very old as well, it had
<br>
 weird writeing on it, it wasent english or oreintal, it was more arabic in form, Max was no expert in langages, but he did have a friend who collected antiuqes, so he
<br>
 figured he would just show it to him and maybe he could tell him what it said! 
<br>

<br>
 Max did notice that it got warmer after he cleaned it with the little underwear, Max looked at the dirt on the underwear and laughed at the size of the underwear,
<br>
 they were so small, like tiny reproductions of the adult size! 
<br>

<br>
 Max threw the tiny underwear in the clothes hamper and went back to the kitchen to make a quick snack, Max noticed that the medallion stayed warm against his
<br>
 chest and he found himself rubbing his hairy pecs with one hand as he fixed a microwave meal with the other. Max felt abit tiered by the time he was done eating
<br>
 and soon he was fast asleep on the couch. 
<br>

<br>
 Max was your typical young guy, he was 25 years old and somewhat athletic, he was into rock climbing and paragliding, and rugby. Just to name a few of his
<br>
 hobbys, Max was the kind of guy who looked good with a goatee, and some short beard stuble on his face, aside from just being lazy when it came to shaveing,
<br>
 Max was a nice looking young man, he always kept his hair well cut, he had long blonde bangs that would sometimes fall into his face and got in his way, but he
<br>
 would just brush them back with his hand, and most of the time they would stay at the sides of his head, Max's hair was feathered back from his forhead, and he
<br>
 parted it in the middle. It looked good on him that way. 
<br>

<br>
 Max could have been a model if he wanted to, he had the face and the body for it, but he was happy being the enginer he was, Max was awoken by a loud
<br>
 pounding on his front door. &quot;UHM..Hold on a minute! Im coming,DAMB!&quot; Max said, Max rubbed his chest and sighed, for some reason he felt real tierd, Max sat
<br>
 up and looked over at the door, who ever it was they were still knocking at it, and it pissed him off! &quot;LOOK IM COMING DAMB IT!&quot; Max yelled as he stood
<br>
 up. 
<br>

<br>
 Max had taken his shirt off before he fell asleep, so all he had on was a pair of jeans and a pair of socks, Max started for the door, but he had to stop on the way
<br>
 there to hike up his jeans, &quot;Thats weird?&quot; Max said as he pulled them up to his waist, Max was still to tierd to give it much thought, so he continued for the door,
<br>
 Max did notice though that he had to keep pulling the jeans up to keep them from slipping down his thighs. Max thought that was weird but he just blew it off and
<br>
 opened the door. 
<br>

<br>
 Max looked up to the knocker, it was Tom Arden! Max didnt like this guy to much, and only tolerated his company because they worked together, and he lived in
<br>
 the same apartment complex that he did. Max knew the guy had a thing for Max, but Max didnt want anything to do with him! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What Tom?&quot; Max said bluntly, Max hoped he would just go away and leive him alone. &quot;Come on Max, its the weekend dude! You going to sleep it away man!'
<br>
 Tom said in a excited tone. Max shook his head and opened the door for him to come on in, Max didnt even look at him he just turned around and headed back
<br>
 for the couch, Max had to keep one hand on the waist line of his jeans just to keep them from sliding down his thighs, and he felt a little emberissed by it. The last
<br>
 thing he wanted to do was give this asshole something to say something about him! 
<br>

<br>
 Max just wanted this guy to go home, but he knew that wasent going to happen right away, Max decided he would just offer him a beer and just make some small
<br>
 talk while they drank their beer and then he tell him he had something to do and he would have to leive, that way he wouldnt hurt the guys feelings. Max asked him
<br>
 if he wanted one and he of coarse said yes! Max headed for the kitchen, Tom watched him walking towards the kitchen, he noticed that something seemed
<br>
 different about Max, he looked like he might be looseing weight or something, and it seemed he had to hold up the waist band of his jeans as he walked. 
<br>

<br>
 Max grabbed two beers out of the fridge and a bag of chips and dip and headed back with both his hands full, as Max walked though he could feel his jeans
<br>
 rideing down his waist, Max picked up his pace so he could get to the couch before the jeans slipped down to his crotch. Man this just aint right he thought as he
<br>
 came back into the livingroom, Max knew these jeans fit him right when he got home from the store so something had happened to them while he was sleeping,
<br>
 maybe he just streached them out while he was asleep, it was the only explanation! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom watched Max as he came in, Tom could see the entire elastic waist band of Max's underwear above jeans that looked two sizes to big for Max. Something
<br>
 else seemed wrong with Max as well, Max always looked like he hadent shaved in two days but now his deeply dimpled cheeks were smooth as a babys ass, and
<br>
 it looked like he had trimed down his goatee as well, it looked softer and thinner then it normally did. Tom also noticed that Max's chest hairs and furry stomache
<br>
 didnt look like they should his chest hair not only looked sparser it looked soft and silky almost, like a teenagers would look when he first started to develope adult
<br>
 body hair. Tom still thought he looked hot and just watched him as he came into better veiw, Max looked thinner and less muscular also though, and Tom, who
<br>
 did'nt know how Max felt about him was mildly concerned, about Max's apperent weight lose, &quot;Hey Max, are you feeling alright buddy? I mean it looks like you
<br>
 might be looseing weight my friend!&quot; Tom said with a voice of concern. 
<br>

<br>
 Max was somewhat taken back by the statement and his handsome face showed his feelings about the statement quite well! Max handed Tom a beer and set his
<br>
 down on the table and then hiked up his jeans, theyed riden down to almost crotch level by then and he knew that Tom must have noticed that his jeans were a
<br>
 little loose on him, and that was probably why he asked him about the weight lose thing, &quot;No Im not sick Tom, your probably talking about these damb jeans being
<br>
 so loose on me right!&quot; Max said as he pulled them up again and sat down. &quot;I think I streached them out while I was sleeping on the couch thats all I can figure? So
<br>
 whats up dude?&quot; Max said as he opened his beer and looked over to Tom. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;No offence dude but youve deffenetly lost some weight my friend. Its more then just your jeans being streached out man!&quot; Tom said as he opened his beer and
<br>
 just staired at Max's face, &quot;Why'd you trim your goatee dude? I hate to say this but it makes you look like a teenager dude!' Tom said as he rocked his head up
<br>
 and down in the yes gesture. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What are you talking about? I havent even shaved yet!&quot; Max was starting to get a little upset with Toms comments and unconciuosly rubbed his face as he sat
<br>
 there, what he didnt feel made him a little unnerved, his cheeks were baby smooth, and his goatee felt softer and finer then he knew it normally felt! Max thought he
<br>
 had better get this visit over with and take a look at how he looked in the mirror, Max started to make up excusses to get rid of Tom but it wasent working, Tom
<br>
 just wouldnt leive. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom had been stairing at Max in the weirdest way and Max was getting a little pissed off about it, it gave him the creeps to be staired at like this. &quot;WHAT ARE
<br>
 YOU STAIRING AT TOM! Your giving me the creeps alright!&quot; Max said and sighed, &quot;Look Tom your gonna have to leive now! Alright.&quot; Max said in a angry
<br>
 tone. Tom had been watching Max so closely because he was seeing him quite litterally changing right there in front of him. Max was for some reason getting
<br>
 younger as they sat there and talked. Tom didnt know why Max seemed to be getting younger but he was loving it all the same. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom had reasons to like what was apperently happening to Max without Max being aware of it. Max was Tom's boss at work, and Tom had, had a crush on him
<br>
 for along time now and today was no exception. But something was happening to Max and Tom seemed to be the only one of the two to pick up on it. Tom also
<br>
 would have loved to be the one in control of the situation between the two guys, And now that it seemed like the mighty Max was getting younger without his
<br>
 knowing it the tables seemed like they might just change hands and real soon at this rate! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom calmed down the situation enough to get Max back to just talking again, Tom wanted to wait this one out and see what the outcome might finally be! What if
<br>
 Max kept getting even younger? After all Max's goatee was little more then peach fuzz now and Max had lost more weight as well, Tom knew he was now bigger
<br>
 then Max was now, and the very thought of Tom being the one in control gave him a hard on. 
<br>

<br>
 Max was begging to pick up on some of the changes to him though, he had noticed that the waist line of the jeans didnt even touch his own waistline anymore, and
<br>
 even the elastic waistband of his underwear didnt cling to his waist! Max was begining to trip out and just wanted Tom to leive! Max stood up and looked down to
<br>
 where Tom was sitting and told him he needed to leive now! But as Max stood there his jeans were sliding down his waist and thighs, Max had to reach down and
<br>
 grab them before they fell down to his knees. Tom was loving this and even laughed as Max grabbed for the jeans with a look of shock on his now teenaged face. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom stood up and looked way down to look Max in his eyes. &quot;I dont know whats happening to you Max? But it would appear your getting younger my freand!
<br>
 And it would also appear that your getting smaller in stature as well Max!So now what did you want me to do young man! Or should I say boy?&quot; Tom said with an
<br>
 evil grin. 
<br>

<br>
 Max was freaking out! What was he talking about, he didnt feel younger but his jeans sure as hell were getting bigger on him! &quot;LOOK I DONT KNOW WHAT
<br>
 YOUR TALKING ABOUT TOM! But I think you should leive! RIGHT NOW!&quot; Max said in a tone of voice he hadent heard in along time! Max thought he
<br>
 sounded like a kid in his early teens! Max quickly brought his hand to his face to feel for his goatee! It was gone and his cheeks felt soft and smooth,&quot;OH GOD!
<br>
 WHATS HAPPENING TO ME!&quot; Max said as he looked down at the jeans he had on, they were huge on him now and they were all bunched up around the tops
<br>
 of his socked feet that were now standing in the cuffs of the jeans. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom laughed and looked down at Max again, poor Max now looked to be about twelve years old and was more or less defenceless against Tom now, and Tom
<br>
 knew it! And now as Max was forced to look way up to look Tom in his eyes he knew it to! &quot;MY MY MAX! You look positively cute! You must have been as
<br>
 handsmoe as a boy as you were when you were a man!&quot; Tom said to him with a grin! &quot;WHAT DO YOU MEAN! WHEN I WAS A MAN! Max yelled, he
<br>
 sounded like a kid when he yelled and he knew it! Max was freaking out! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well Max it looks like your going to need my help boy!&quot; Tom said smuggly. Max just looked around the room in panic, everthing seemed so big and tall to him
<br>
 now, espesially Tom who used to be just an inch or so taller then he was! But now he litterally towered above him! The meadallion now hung down to his hairless
<br>
 belly button area and it was almost burning his skin it was so warm. Max let go of his jeans and grabbed at the meadallion to pull it away from his stomache, what
<br>
 he saw when his jeans and underwear left his now frail waist line freaked him out! He was hairless he didnt even have pubic hair anymore,&quot; THIS Aint happening!&quot;
<br>
 Max's voice craked back to that of a prepubesent kids and he had a look of shock on his little 7 yearold face. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom walked over to the now boy and smiled down at him! &quot;WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IVE JUST ADOPTED A SON!&quot; Tom said. The very thought of this
<br>
 statement scared the hell out of Max as he just got even smaller and younger! Max finally stoped getting younger when his body reached the age of the child that
<br>
 would have worn the underwear he had cleaned the medallion off with. Max was now a four year old boy again! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom looked around the room and scoped out a pair of the little miniture underwears and picked it up, Tom then came over to Max and picked him up, Max was in
<br>
 to much shock to run away from him, Max knew he was stuck in a little kids body but still knew he was twenty five years old. He was helpless against Tom now!
<br>
 As Tom lifted him off the ground he felt his jeans underwear and socks leive his body, he was totaly naked now! Tom set him off to the side of his pile of old
<br>
 clothes and handed him the tiny underwear! Max looked down at them and tears formed in his eyes, he felt expossed so he put them on! They were a perfect fit!</p>
