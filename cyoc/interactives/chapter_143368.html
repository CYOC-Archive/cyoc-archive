<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Obligatory sex scene. A lot of inspiration was taken from this chapter by Dragonman: /interactives/chapter_143312.htm<br/>
<br/>
Edit: ChronoSeth did a nice rewrite of this chapter. Disregard this one and read the rewrite/corrected version here: /interactives/chapter_143388.html</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are unable to hiss a reply back. A thick fog clouds your mind, and your large feet begin to feel unbearably cold.<br />
<br />
You wrap your coils around them to shield them from the cold, but immediately regret it, stifling a hiss as your cocks begin to throb, almost painfully. <br />
<br />
Sam gives an annoyed huff at your silence, and cross her arms, not noticing your struggle.  “Are you going to tell us what&#39;s going on or what?” The lizard woman asks.<br />
<br />
You ignore her, yelling countless profanities in your head as you realize your feet are once again unbearably sensitive. Even as your tail barely touches them you feel incredible pleasure.<br />
<br />
You try to think of anything other than your feet. If your friends found out you had a foot fetish they&#39;d probably be disgusted, as if you weren&#39;t embarrassed enough from the attention you&#39;d gotten.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts begin to feel clouded. Laying on the ground, your gaze falls to Alex&#39;s feline feet. Glancing up you admire his feline rod and sack. His thick and powerful muscles...<br />
<br />
They&#39;re so mesmerizing… You want them…<br />
<br />
Your eyes dart to Sam&#39;s rather well endowed reptilian form. Purple latex drips from her breasts and vagina.<br />
<br />
Your balls rumble quietly, your twitching cocks threatening to gush out yellow goo any second just by looking at them both.<br />
<br />
You shut your eyes tight, trying to regain your rationale. You really wanted sex?! This was clearly not the time!<br />
<br />
“You know, you can tell us if something&#39;s wrong...” Alex says, scratching his head anxiously. <br />
<br />
You hiss quietly, and shake your head to tell them everything is fine.<br />
<br />
“Alright then. If we&#39;re done here then we can start moving. Get up snake boy.” Sam says irritated. <br />
<br />
She turns to head for the door to the hallway, motioning for Alex to follow.<br />
<br />
You curse yourself in your head, every negative word coming to mind. Now it was inevitable. They would laugh at you endlessly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You tried to think of something else. Anything else. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You give a low hiss as you get to your knees. You involuntarily twitch as your tail accidentally brushes against one of your scaly rubber soles, causing your cocks to drip yellow goop. You give an irritated hiss, although your friends don&#39;t  appear to notice, only worsening your situation.<br />
<br />
You slowly get to your feet, giving out a relieved sigh as no pleasure appears to come. <br />
<br />
You were blessed.<br />
<br />
Then you internally scream at coldness of the tile floor against your soles. <br />
<br />
More or less cursed.<br />
<br />
Instantly you collapse back to the floor landing onto your stomach, writhing in pleasure. Loud squeaking results from your twin dicks and balls rubbing against the floor, only causing more bliss.<br />
<br />
As if to spite you, no yellow rubber spurts out from your dicks.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is wrong with you?!” Sam yells, turning around at the sudden noise.<br />
<br />
“Is he having a seizure or something?” Alex asks in fear.<br />
<br />
The purple lizard angrily walks over to you, with a hint of worry on her face.<br />
<br />
However, her anger and fear quickly dissipates as she looks into your eyes, and down at your groin. A mischievous grin crosses her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... It seems our slithery friend here is having some... Troubles.&quot; She says,  pointing a claw to your erect twin rods. Alex recoils. You give a nervous hiss and hide your face behind your hands. <br />
<br />
A loud gurgle from your balls resonates throughout the room, embarrassing you more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eugh! Martin? That&#39;s...&quot; The tiger trails off and looks away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought he was immune or something!&quot; He yells. Sam shakes her head. &quot;Like anyone could be immune to this. I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t experienced this part of being a latex animal.&quot; She says, causing Alex&#39;s head to tilt curiously. “Part?” He asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say, this state causes some parts of your body to be unbearably sensitive, so sensitive that it is… sexually stimulating.&quot; You hiss shyly as you try to not stare at her reptilian feet. <br />
<br />
“Not to mention making you very horny.” She adds. <br />
<br />
“It probably has to due with the massive amounts of latex our bodies produce. If you haven&#39;t noticed tiger, these ladies are still leaking.” She says, pointing to her breasts.<br />
<br />
“And it seems Martin here has so much built up latex that it&#39;s clouding his thoughts.&quot; She looks down at you. &quot;Am I right?&quot; She asks, and you respond with a sluggish nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then again if you&#39;ve managed to ignore it for this long you must be something.&quot; She says, clapping sarcastically. You looks away sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Well we can&#39;t get anything done with those two pillars of yours standing so tall. Get ready.” She says, grinning.<br />
<br />
You shield your face behind your coils and hiss timidly.<br />
<br />
“Um… You&#39;re not going to--”<br />
<br />
“Of course I am. Did you have any idea how many monsters I rode when I was that dragon&#39;s slave?” She inquires, cutting the tiger&#39;s sentence off and positioning herself over your dicks.<br />
<br />
“Mmm…” She brings one of her claws and trails it down one of your cocks, causing you to shiver. <br />
<br />
“I suppose you really were hiding something from me! None of those drones could compare to these bad boys.” She says sultrily, a lustful look in her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Ahhh…!” She moans as one of your cocks enters her, your hisses of pleasure join her moans. Alex stares on in awkward silence, his eyes wide.<br />
<br />
She brings your free rod up her to mouth and begins to slowly lick it with her forked tongue. You give a sensual hiss and wiggle your toes, sinking into your coils.<br />
<br />
You look at her three toed reptilian feet bashfully. Sam appeared to take notice, and winked at you devilishly.<br />
<br />
“My my, seems like somebody has a liking for feet.” She says, grinning. She lifts one of her feet up to your snout. “Well, I won&#39;t stop you snake boy.” <br />
<br />
You bring your hands up to her feet, a slight smile crossing your face. She gives a smile as you pressed your clawed thumb into her sole.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the massaging turned into licking, with you savoring her taste. Your forked tongue worked its way down to her toes, going in between. Your eyes almost roll back into your head. <br />
<br />
Your orbs groaned as she continued to ride your dick, the other now being sucked off. You hiss blissfully as her own tail wraps around your still sensitive feet, the tip caressing your soles. Loud squeaking echoes throughout the room.<br />
<br />
Instantly your members spurt out globs of yellow goop. The lizard woman gives a muffled moan as the latex enters her from both ends. You give a muffled hiss in response, her entire foot inside your mouth.<br />
<br />
A mix of yellow and purple latex drips from her pussy and trickles down your rod onto your stomach and the tile floor below.<br />
<br />
She pants as she releases your other dick from her mouth. You slowly let her foot go from her mouth, but not before giving it one last lick.<br />
<br />
“That was quite a show, Martin.” She says, grinning at you. You shyly hiss back. The fog from your mind is gone. <br />
<br />
A loud roar pierces through the room. <br />
<br />
You and Sam both lay eyes on Alex, the white tiger standing with a puddle of white latex at his feet, his large dick still dripping. He pants, not realizing your show had ended.<br />
<br />
He immediately blushes as you both grin at him and looks down.<br />
<br />
“So, you like to watch? I can&#39;t blame you.” Sam says still grinning. <br />
<br />
“Umm…. I…” <br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s perfectly normal.” She cuts him off. She slowly picks herself off of you and stands up.<br />
<br />
You hiss as you rise from the from the floor. Once on your feet, you flex them as you feel no pleasure. You give a thumbs up to your friends.<br />
<br />
“Well, now that we got that issue out of the way we need to clean this up.” Sam declares, signaling to your yellow residue.<br />
<br />
“Eh? Why?” Alex asks. Sam sighs as if the reason wasn&#39;t obvious.<br />
<br />
“Oh I don&#39;t know, so the animals can&#39;t track us. It seems Martin here is the only one with yellow latex. Ours don&#39;t need to be cleaned, there&#39;s ton of other purple and white animals.”<br />
<br />
“Um… Shouldn&#39;t they be here any second though? That whole session had a lot of squeaking, hissing, and moaning…” The tiger says nervously, glancing at the door. Sam shrugs.<br />
<br />
“Oh please. If you were to listen closely you&#39;d probably hear another pair of drones going at it down the hallway. There&#39;s more throughout the entire mansion as well. I&#39;d know. I was one of them.” She says matter-of-factly. The feline stares dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
She looks down at the yellow latex in thought.<br />
<br />
“You know, I must say after consuming your seed I feel quite refreshed.” The purple lizard says to you. You hiss confused as she looks at Alex with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Hey there tiger, come have a sip.” He steps back in shock.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, what.” He says flatly.<br />
<br />
“You heard me kitty. You need some of this. Going by our theory, the yellow latex should prevent us from losing our sanity.” Sam explains. Alex tugs at his ears.<br />
<br />
“F-Fine…” He stammers knowing he can&#39;t argue.<br />
<br />
He slowly walks over to the puddle of yellow rubber and stares at it. The white tiger looks at you unsure. You nod.<br />
<br />
He gives a defeated sigh as he gets to his knees and begins to lap up the yellow goo.<br />
<br />
“Good job tiger.” Sam says grinning as the puddle begins to shrink. <br />
<br />
Within seconds no trace of it remains. <br />
<br />
Alex pants as he wipes some spare latex off of his muzzle. “That didn&#39;t taste too bad…” He admitted. “I guess I feel better too.” He adds.<br />
<br />
Slowly the three of you turn towards the door to the hallway. <br />
<br />
“So um… Now that we&#39;ve got that out of the way can we go find my friends? I&#39;m sure they&#39;re here already...” Alex says worriedly.<br />
<br />
“A gut feeling?” Sam asks. The feline nods. “Very well then. Let&#39;s go.” She says, looking to you. <br />
<br />
You nod and begin walk to the door, with Alex following anxiously.<br />
<br />
“Wait.” She says, causing you both to spin around. “Now what?” The tiger asks annoyed<br />
<br />
She points to your massive tail.<br />
<br />
“Martin, that long tail of yours will allow latex creatures to easily follow us, especially if we&#39;re running. Try wrapping it around your neck like a scarf or something.” She informs. You glance down at your coils and shrug.<br />
<br />
Complying, you throw it over your shoulder and begin a tedious process of wrapping it around yourself.<br />
<br />
You nod as you finish.<br />
<br />
“Now we can go.” Sam whispers to Alex.<br />
<br />
Slowly opening the door, you poke your head out. Your reptilian eyes scan the expansive hallway and see no sign of any latex animals.<br />
<br />
Stepping out, you signal for Sam and Alex to come out. <br />
<br />
Then you hiss in suprise as you hear footsteps from the corner of the hall.</p>
