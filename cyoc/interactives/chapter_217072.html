<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Most of France&#39;s Animalian colony was entirely focused on Juliet&#39;s chateau and what was allowed to be built up there in addition to the colony, and while there had been their various dramas there, it had provided some measure of success for a lot of popular opinion of Animalians and their society in the region. And for two residents of Mardeuil, France, Jacques and Mary Lumiere, that had come with some of the other bits of attention that had come to the region as Phoebe and Vive&#39;s spa began to take shape in town. The prospect of local success and additional sites that would suit the tourist industry, as people often did like to come to the Champagne region to buy the various vintages that the vineyards had.<br />
<br />
For Jacques and Mary, the decision to convert to being an Animalian in part came from part of the attention that came from that. Though a part of it was paying off now as the government&#39;s present schemes with raising the retirement age were being met with protests. Neither were fond of the scheme, but as Animalians now, they were stronger and were young enough that they would live long enough to find someone or a party that would be able to defat both the Fascists on the far Right and the Communists on the far Left and protect the rights of all in the future. But for the moment, the two of them were content to be Wild Boar Animalians and serve as part of a reason to help protect the local vineyards from the mundane versions of their species. <br />
<br />
It was work they&#39;d done before, and was often risky, as Wild Boar were not docile animals. It often required a fair amount of travel, just to keep an eye on things in the area around Mardeuil, but Jacques and Mary had always managed, and now that would be a bit easier. The could cover ground quickly and they had a nice home in Mardeuil that they wouldn&#39;t leave. Though as Jacques worked on his and Mary&#39;s breakfast one morning, he remembered the conversation at Juliet&#39;s chateau that had happened shortly after he and his wife had converted...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not wanting to stay here, with us?&quot; Violet, the purple-colored Raccoon Animalian before Jacques and Mary, asked after their conversion.<br />
<br />
Both were built and well-muscled, but unlike most of the Domestic Pig Animalians in Animalia, which often only had a thin layer of rather clear hair or little hair and leaving rather pink skin, were covered in brown to dark brown fur that was very thick. Particularly along the back of Jacques&#39; neck that would do well in winter. Mary&#39;s fur was also fairly thick, and all of this showed the difference between Domestic Pigs and Wild Boar. The two of them had noticeable tusks with that often clicked together when they both talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madame Renard-Argente has a lovely chateau, madam,&quot; Jacques answered, &quot;and as needed, my wife and I will continue to run our business to make sure that mundane boar do not come into the vineyards and get comfortable. But that responsibility takes us to other vineyards in the area as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, we have our own home, and it is sufficient enough for us,&quot; Mary added while taking Jacques&#39; hand in hers, &quot;we can come for the renewing of the vaccination to assure that things don&#39;t spread the infectious part of the Animalia Virus...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll be clean when you come to visit for that, or any other occasion?&quot; Violet asked.<br />
<br />
This was more an effort to keep the chateau in order, which in part was Violet&#39;s job as Juliet&#39;s lady in waiting. It was something that happened while Juliet was busier with the education side of the business that she ran. The vineyard and the maintenance of the chateau often fell more to Violet, and this often included seeing to other things that went on at the chateau. This would also include making sure that Georgette&#39;s job of keeping the chateau clean being much easier, particularly now with some boys in some of the residences as male students learning as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;As clean as can be,&quot; Jacques answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Particularly when pigs of all kinds can actually be very clean animals, all things considered,&quot; Mary added, &quot;you have sturdy looking floor mats, so keeping our feet clean should be easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Violet replied, &quot;though I would be out of line to not say that you would be welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And again, we appreciate the invitation,&quot; Mary answered, &quot;but we are happy with our home.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Is breakfast ready?&quot; came a feminine voice that snapped Jacques out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
He turned back over his shoulder to see Mary standing in the doorway to the kitchen while he was working on a breakfast that included eggs, potatoes, and other bits of food that would work with it. The breakfast obviously had no pork products in it. Wild Boar were omnivorous, but there was the basis of avoiding something that could be seen as &quot;cannibalism.&quot; The one thing that really drew Jacques&#39; attention was that Mary was only in her nightgown, which was well stretched over her enhanced curves as an Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nearly my dear,&quot; Jacques answered, &quot;very nearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It smells good,&quot; Mary gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Jacques nodded.</p>
