<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben quietly set to work on getting the guest room ready. The Twist home was smaller than the Anderson&#39;s home next door with only one floor, and in its floor plan really only had two bedrooms, the master bedroom that his moms used and the bedroom that he had. The other rooms that flanked the hallway that lead to the main living room area was one general purpose bathroom and a sort of craft/storage room on one side and modest sized study on the other side. However, his moms tended to have things well enough organized that neither really needed an actual office space at home, and so that study became the guest bedroom. It wasn&#39;t big, but it did fit a bed, a night stand, and even a small chest of drawers should they ever have guests that would stay longer.<br />
<br />
Cleaning the room and getting it ready for guests wasn&#39;t too bad. It wasn&#39;t a large room and his moms didn&#39;t let him store extra stuff in the room. As such the main thing that he needed to do was vacuum the floor, dust the furniture, and place clean sheets on the bed and make sure it was made. Some might keep a guest fully ready at all times, but the Twists had only rarely had guests over that would spend the night, and many times when one did, it was like when his moms welcomed Martha Anderson into were society and when they had fun with Martha, it was in the master bedroom.  This meant that the guest bedroom rarely got any use and thus there never seemed to be the need to make sure the bed was kept made.<br />
<br />
Most of the others that could be expected to visit were family, but nearly all of them lived in Moon Lake already. Samantha&#39;s moms lived in a different part of Moon Lake as did Frances&#39; parents and her brother. The only family that didn&#39;t live in Moon Lake were Frances&#39; grandparents, but as far as Ben knew, they were too old to leave the retirement home they were living in and contact with Frances&#39; side of the family was just patchy enough that they might have died of old age and Frances simply hadn&#39;t been told yet. Some of that was likely the result of her family deciding to become weredogs, and Ben knew that they were all based off of some breed of foxhound, and some odd responses to finding out that Frances had been a lesbian even before becoming a werecat. Ben knew that the relationship wasn&#39;t hate filled in that Frances&#39; parents did still love her, but contact was patchy and the one they saw the most of was Frances&#39; brother, and he also lived in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
This left Ben a bit curious as to who would be coming over and for what purpose the guest&#39;s arrival was to serve. It was only natural. Part of Ben wondered if it was a friend that Frances had made while she was in Med School to ultimately earn her license to serve as a psychiatrist and psychologist. However, while he might have questions and curiousness over why the guest room was to be readied, that didn&#39;t stop him from doing the work needed. He stretched a set of blue sheets over the bed and lay a light blanket over the top of it.  As he did so, Ben&#39;s mind also pondered over some other issues that were on his mind. He wondered on how the city would work with Austin&#39;s volunteers to help protect the wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate might be a bit disappointed in not being able to volunteer given the requirement that they have to be eighteen or older, since the idea was his,&quot; Ben thought to himself, &quot;but then... he didn&#39;t really show it on the ride back. Maybe he was simply pleased that his idea for at least the pack rallying against against a clear threat to the town... Which, I&#39;d say is a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The threats that Dieter Wilhelm posed were clear. While he wasn&#39;t necessarily hunting weres or anything like that, the fact that he had supported underhanded threats to kill a person who had grown up in Moon Lake and from what he knew wanted to force his will on another person who didn&#39;t want him was enough to pose a threat  in that good people could be killed by such action. Though, coordinating things between the Skulk, the city&#39;s police, and any volunteers from the pack. Ben figured that might mean that the guest room was being readied because Samantha and Frances had some planning that they&#39;d be undertaking that had the potential to go late into the night. Some might then be too tired to go home, so the guest room is being readied as a precaution.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should give Kenya a call into some things,&quot; Ben wondered, &quot;if this meeting is important, I don&#39;t want to get in the way... But would she be okay with that? Would her uncle and aunt? &quot;<br />
<br />
As he finished he collected his phone and dialed a number and after a few brief rings, he heard a polite &quot;hello&quot; answer him. He smiled as he heard Kenya&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... I don&#39;t want to impose on you... but I may need to ask you... or rather your aunt and uncle for a favor,&quot; Ben spoke into his phone.<br />
<br />
Kenya responded in a fairly friendly tone, &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no imposition my handsome wolf.  What is this favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I think my folks might be having some big city meeting tonight regarding all the stuff that&#39;s been going on with the upcoming wedding that could go late into the night,&quot; Ben began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure where I could help with any meeting,&quot; Kenya answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s more providing a space to stay for the night,&quot; Ben said slowly, &quot;If it is an important meeting, I don&#39;t want to be in the way as I do have some homework to work on and wouldn&#39;t be able to completely focus on if they&#39;re having a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If... you mean you don&#39;t know what they&#39;re planning?&quot; Kenya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that they&#39;ve asked me to get our guest room ready, and its one that we don&#39;t use very often,&quot; Ben explained, &quot;and with everything going on... the only reason I could think of would be with planning out this wedding and its security. If it is... I may need a place to stay for the night... and potentially finish my homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Kenya&#39;s tone sounded rather mischievous, &quot;I would love to have you over for the night, regardless of whether or not its a major meeting, my handsome wolf... but what if it&#39;s just a friend they want you to meet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s just a friend, than we could still meet later this evening and I could see if I can inquire into your costume plans for Halloween,&quot; Ben replied, &quot;I just wanted to check and see if you, your aunt, and your uncle could be flexible enough if it is a big meeting that I don&#39;t want to be a distraction towards. I&#39;ll let you know when I know more... but I thought it best give you some heads up now, rather than simply show up at your door at eight thirty looking for dinner and a bed. This way you&#39;d be prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m sure we can be flexible,&quot; Kenya responded, &quot;if need be, we can even throw in dinner if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Kenya,&quot; Ben answered, &quot;I&#39;ll try to get the full details when my folks get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope to see you soon,&quot; Kenya replied.<br />
<br />
From there the phone call ended, and as he hung up he heard a car pull into the driveway.</p>
