<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, have you figured out how to change me back?&quot; Luke asked his sister as he came in her room. His anger could be heard in his voice tone. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, go.&quot; Tiff harshly replied. &quot;I&#39;m still examining the fruits. Unless you want to take a leap of faith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s ok. I don&#39;t want to end up as grandpa or so. Bad enough is to have a bigger belly than dad.&quot; Luke said as he put a hand on his stomach. Tiff didn&#39;t hear it, but Luke&#39;s belly was gurgling a little. &quot;Jeez, I really need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, go. Why are you telling me?&quot; Tiff raised an eyebrow as she briefly glanced at her brother. &quot;Or are you afraid of something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s... Fine... I&#39;m going to tell you.&quot; Luke sighed. &quot;When I was dressing up I touched my butt...&quot; He still hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; She stopped watching through her microscope and kept her sight on Luke who seemed a little embarrassed to keep talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was... hairy...&quot; Despite of his beard, Tiff could notice that Luke was blushing ashamed. She wanted to burst into laughter but she knew that his brother was mortified and she preferred to be supportive.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; She tried to sound indifferent. &quot;There are enough toilet paper in the bathroom... and in case you make a big mess you can always take a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t want anything with this body!! I hate it!!&quot; Luke began to raise his voice, almost yelling. &quot;Just thinking about being naked and watching myself makes me sick! It&#39;s like I&#39;m a lame Jack Black look alike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not.&quot; Tiff replied. &quot;He&#39;s not that hairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough.&quot; Luke said as he left Tiff&#39;s room. &quot;I&#39;m going to my bedroom. Maybe if I ignore it, I won&#39;t need to go to the bathroom. Call me when you find the cure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It could take hours.&quot; Tiff said. &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; She didn&#39;t get an answer because Luke was already gone. She smiled a little and kept looking through her microscope. &quot;Wow, I just can&#39;t tell him that he looks exactly like dad. I hope in a few years he accepts himself because that&#39;s how his body is going to be in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke was going to his bedroom when his phone started ringing. It was Kyle. He remembered that his friends were still downstairs in the living room waiting for him. There&#39;s no way they could see him like this but he can&#39;t ignore Kyle&#39;s call either. So, he coughed a little trying to high his pitch as much as his manly voice let him and answered the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke? What happened to you? Are you ok?&quot; Kyle sounded noticeable worried. After all, he was his best friend. &quot;Me and Jake are waiting for you to come back since an hour ago. Brooks has even left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m, I&#39;m fine.&quot; Luke was doing his best to sound like a kid but it wasn&#39;t convincing at all. &quot;I just got an allergic reaction to the fruit and Tiff is helping me with that...&quot; Well, that wasn&#39;t totally a lie, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sounds very bad.&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Is there something we can do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N, no. Tiff will take care of me.&quot; Luke said. He wasn&#39;t trying to sound high pitched anymore. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, if you say so...&quot; Kyle replied. &quot;Jeez, I can even bet you sounds almost like my dad.&quot; Luke didn&#39;t like to hear that. &quot;Ok, we&#39;ll see you later... Oh, Jake said he left his backpack in your room and I remember I left mine there as well! We&#39;re going to take them and we leave!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Wait!!&quot; Luke shouted but it was useless, he can hear Kyle and Jake already going upstairs. He has no place to go, he was trapped in his bedroom and eventually his friends will see him and freak out. What is he going to do? He barely had time to do anything when he heard his door&#39;s opening. He immediately used his body to block the door, he didn&#39;t know what else to do. Fortunately, his bigger body gave him a huge advantage against his preteen friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke? What are you doing? Let us in!&quot; Jake yelled while he and Kyle pushed the door with all his strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t come in!&quot; Luke shouted with his deep baritone resounding through the whole place.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t my phone. You definitely sounds like my dad!&quot; Kyle said. &quot;What&#39;s going on Luke? What are you hiding from us? We won&#39;t leave until you tell us! What did that fruit do to you? We&#39;re your friends, you can trust us.&quot; Luke sighed, he felt cornered. He realized that his only choice was to tell them the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;F, fine. Hear me first and then I&#39;ll let you in.&quot; Luke said and he noticed that his friends had stopped pushing the door. &quot;Ok, this is what happened...&quot; He told them everything that happened to him since the moment he ate the unripened fruit. He intentionally avoided to tell them about his lame dad bod or his disgust of his body hair. &quot;And now I&#39;m here... trying to convince you...&quot; When he stopped talking, a brief silence came and then Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... You are an adult now, huh? Can we see you?&quot; Jake slowly opened the door while Luke made a few steps back. His stomach was gurgling again and he knew that he won&#39;t be able to contain his need to go to the bathroom for much longer. He sighed once again while he watched his friends coming in.<br />
<br />
&quot;L, Luke? Is that you?&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Now I understand why you sound like my dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, when you said you&#39;d grown up I thought you&#39;ll look like 20 or so. You&#39;re way more older than us!&quot; Jake&#39;s voice tone didn&#39;t sound as excited as before. He even sounded kinda disappointed. &quot;I was going to ask you for some of that fruit but if I&#39;m going to end up as my father I think I prefer to pass... Where did you find big enough clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I took them from my dad&#39;s drawer.&quot; Luke replied as he blushed in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you telling us that you&#39;re wearing your dad&#39;s underwear?&quot; Kyle asked before he and Jake stared at each other for an instant. &quot;Yuck! That&#39;s disgusting, dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know but I didn&#39;t have any other choice.&quot; Luke said. &quot;I&#39;m still uncomfortable with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And... Did you get... ehem... bigger down there?&quot; Jake asked with curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is serious, Jake.&quot; Kyle elbowed him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Luke, we&#39;re your friends we&#39;re going to support you in any way we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that!&quot; Tiff&#39;s voice echoed through the room and when the guys turned around, they watch her standing at the door. &quot;I need some test subjects in order to cure my ex little brother.&quot; She smiled. &quot;So, which one of you is going to be the first one?&quot;</p>
