<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>TheMaskedWriter’s chapter “Setting out to solve the mystery” <a href="/interactives/chapter_112356.html">#112356</a> was posted roughly 30 minutes after the last chapter this current one is linked to. Yet it is still in continuity. So please read it first before reading this chapter first if you haven’t done so already.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After having another awkward moment with his mother’s family as he was leaving Grrrrrrr; Ben was rushing home to share Alex the good news he had. Telling his mom France’s put a small smile on her face; yet Ben sensed his mother was dealing with something important. With her promising to tell him when she gets home which should be in a while; Frances also told Ben not to go very far for his other mother Samantha also had some important news to share.<br />
<br />
It was a short conversation over each other’s phone’s before Alex was at Ben’s back door; literally and figuratively. Both enjoying each other’s in the throes of passion; Alex having his top knot lodge in Ben’s anus as both howled in unison to each other’s climaxing. Collapsing on Ben’s bed; both werewolves enjoy their moment of bliss.<br />
“Well,” Ben growling happily; “when I called you to come over, I never expected you to jump me and ravage me. Not that I didn’t like it,” Ben still feeling Alex’s knot lodged in him; “but why risk getting caught in your fursona heading over here?”<br />
“I have some news to share you,” Alex playfully nipping Ben’s ear; “two bits of news actually.”<br />
“Okay,” Ben grinning; “your still locked in my back door, so by all means go first. Again.”<br />
“First,” Alex chuckling at Ben’s innuendo; “I made nearly a grand laying sod with Nate today. The client was an elder council member that payed in advance.”<br />
“Wow,” Ben looking stunned; “his landscaping business is doing that good?”<br />
“Let me finish,” Alex growling; “you know how I hate being interrupted. As I was saying,” Alex continuing; “the client paid in advance and wanted Kentucky blue grass laid down. Apparently the were-horse rep and her husband like the feel of the grass on their fur. My second bit of news,” Alex licking his still prone lover affectionately; “A girl approached me asking to join our pack. I’m waiting for our pack leader Austin to get back to me regarding details.”<br />
“Hmmmm,” Ben growling; “she better not of made a pass at you.”<br />
“Naw,” Alex nipping Ben’s ear again; “shes know you and I are an item. Apparently she has the hots for a member of our pack but is still timid in approaching him. Zylina has a secret crush.”<br />
“Zylina,” Ben starting to struggle to get free; “where have I heard that name before?”<br />
“She was in our math class last school year,” Alex answers; “and stop struggling, I’ll let you up in a bit. You think she has the hots for our recent pack member?”<br />
<br />
Alex of course was referring to John Shaffer Jr. a fifteen year old werewolf who was large for his age. In his human form the boy stands at a good six feet in height; when furry, his height is a good seven to eight feet. The young werewolf sporting yellow eyes when in his fursona and a fur pattern marking him as a timber wolf variant; John was a catch that drove some to the single females in the pack crazy for his knot in them. But that was not what surprised Ben and Alex when he was inducted; Finding out the werewolf had a deft paw in cooking, the entire pack ended up forgoing a hunt just to devour all the tasty treats the young cook brought over from his after school catering job.<br />
 <br />
“You know,” Ben responding just as he was able to get out from under Alex; “Your guess is as good as mine. But now,” Ben using his lupine speed and agility; “it’s my turn to be on top and share some good news. But first,” Ben growling; “prepare for a good rutting.”<br />
Growling as his tail is wagging; Ben guides his lupine member into Alex’s tight sphincter. Both elicit a whimper as the penetration occurs. Ben quickly schmearing lube to help ease further penetration, pauses; giving Alex a moment to get use to the foreign object probing his back door. Slowly pulling out before plunging back in; Alex whimpers as Ben growls, nipping at Alex’s ears as he slowly builds tempo, the lube helping to make the tight anal walls slick and easier to push apart with his thrusting as it gains speed.<br />
<br />
Both werewolves whimpering and growling as their climaxes build. Panting as his tongue lolls out; Ben was about ready to burst. Feeling his balls clenching and a pressure travelling up his shaft; Ben thrusts as hard as he can, determined to lock each other together with his knot. Hearing Alex whine as he bottoms out; feeling a swelling build, Ben raises his head to the air and gives off a righteous howl as his seed bursts forth. Filling Alex, as the werewolf’s own lupine rod spasms, spilling its second batch on his fur and Ben’s bed.<br />
<br />
Ben collapsing on top as Alex sighs; enjoying the feeling of being filled; both werewolves once again enjoy their respective moments of bliss.<br />
“Now what’s this good news you have,” Alex murmuring.<br />
“I got the job at Grrrrrrr,” Ben wrapping his paws around Alex and placing them on his lover’s still engorged member. “I’m their newest busboy/waiter,” Ben happily growling; “I got to go back tomorrow to fill out some paperwork and then work out what my shifts will be.”<br />
“That’s wonderful news,” Alex placing his paws above Ben’s; “did you tell your moms?”<br />
“I told Frances,” Ben answers; “she and her family were dining at Grrrrrrr when I had my trial shift. That was nervous to say the least,” Ben answering; “but I think mom is dealing with something big, because she didn’t seem excited with my news. Also,” Ben licking Alex’s muzzle; “mom said not to go far, Samantha will be home soon and she has some big news to share.”<br />
“Well,” Alex responding; “neither of us is going anywhere. You knotted me good there my enthusiastic lover.”<br />
“Sorry for being rough there Alex,” Ben apologizing; “I was just excited and I couldn’t contain myself.”<br />
“Don’t apologize,” Alex chuckling; “that was actually fun. But expect me to be a little rough with you next time. Until then,” Alex getting comfortable on Ben’s bed; “let’s just have an enjoyable post sex nap.”<br />
“And a rousing romp afterwards,” Ben also snuggling, still locked in Alex; “I love you my sexy werewolf.”<br />
“I love,” Alex yawning as he starts to nod off; “you to Ben.”</p>
