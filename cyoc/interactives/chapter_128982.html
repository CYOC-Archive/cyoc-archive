<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samuel looked out of his cell, he could see Lee and Matt talking but couldn&#39;t hear what they were saying. The rooms must be sound proof he reasoned.  He turned to speak with Keith who had sat down to nursing his wounded testicles.  &quot;Sup?&quot; he asked &quot;I&#39;m Samuel.&quot;  Kieth raised his head and grunted, &quot;Kieth&quot; back.  &quot;That looked pretty bad, dude&quot; Samuel offered gesturing at Kieth&#39;s waste.  Kieth looked up at Samuel annoyed, &quot;Of course it hurt fuckwad&quot; Kieth started before he was interrupted by the glass door sliding opening.  Both boy&#39;s snapped to attention.  Four guards and two women in lab coats entered the cell, the door closing behind them.  Samuel looked past them and noticed a similar scene playing out in the other two cells.<br />
<br />
The guards stood in front of the scientist, without saying anything two of them raised their weapons and pointed them at Samuel and Kieth.  Kieth started to protests before two shots rang out and they both were hit with darts.  The tranquilizer worked almost immediately the room went black and Kieth and Samuel hit the ground.  <br />
<br />
Samuel was slow to wake up.  The groggy and sedated feeling was heavy.  He graduatly became aware of his body and then his surroundings.  It was like waking up after a night of hard drinking and still being really drunk.  He even had a headache. The first thing he noticed was that he wasn&#39;t laying down, but he wasn&#39;t quite standing.  He was on his back but tilted up.  He tried to move, but he was strapped down.  He opened his eyes, in an attempt to figure out what was happening to him.  The effect of whatever drug they hit him with was still pretty thick, he smiled at the straps holding down his head, forearms, biceps, chest, waste, and legs.  When did he get naked, he wondered, no they must have done that.  He looked around the room across from him was Kieth, naked and strapped down, lying on his back and still unconscious.  Samuel watched as the scientist moved around Kieth, taking measurements quietly talking to each other.  &quot;Excuse me, ma&#39;am&quot; came a voice from behind Samuel, &quot;this one is awake.&quot;  The scientist looked up from Kieth at Samuel, and then at each other.  Samuel couldn&#39;t tell which one spoke, as they both were wearing surgical masks, &quot;With his history with drugs and alcohol its no wonder, his body has burned through the sedative.&quot;  They looked back at each other and again without any indication of who was speaking one said, &quot;an additional 10 milligrams?&quot; and a different voice agreed &quot;yes 10 should suffice.&quot;  The scientist closest to Samuel stepped away from Kieth and prepared a syringe before stepping over to Samuel and injecting him in the neck.  The room went black again.  <br />
<br />
For the second time, Samuel started to come to.  This time he noticed he was sitting, and yet again he was strapped down, but his this time not his head.  He lifted his head and opened his eyes.  The room was bright a large window let in sunlight that was blinding in his current state.  Samuel tried to use his left foot to push the chair so he wasn&#39;t facing directly into it, but the chair didn&#39;t budge. Though he didn&#39;t know it, it was bolted to the floor.  Samuels eyes slowly adjusted, he was less out of it this time than when he had previously woke.  Samuel was sitting in a modern looking office.  In front of him sat the warden, reading something in a manila folder.  Over to his left was a seating area with couch, chair, and coffee table, to his right a book shelf that took up the entire wall, replete with books and a large TV currently displaying a screensaver.  &quot;Ohh good, you&#39;re conscious&quot; the warden&#39;s attention was now off his reading and now focused on Samuel.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re probably still a little disoriented so I&#39;ll try to keep this simple for you&quot; the warden continued.  Samuel smiled back, &quot;I&#39;ll keep things simple for you too&quot; he sneered, &quot;my face is the last thing you&#39;ll see before you die, so enjoy all this while you can.&quot; Samuel used his chin to gesture around the room.  The warden smiled the same smile Samuel had seen outside the bus, he hated this guy with a passion.  &quot;We&#39;ll start there then&quot; the warden went on, &quot;escape from this place is impossible.  First, you would have to survive the guards, whom are authorized to use deadly force. Then, if you pick the correct direction to head in its a minimum of 60 miles to the nearest town through unforgiving terrain home to poisonous snakes, spiders, and scorpions in 100 degree heat during the day dropping down to 30 degree at night.&quot;  Samuel stared at the warden defiantly. The wardened stared back without a hint of emotion, &quot;finally, and this is my favorite in case you cared to know...&quot; Samuel interrupted him &quot;I don&#39;t&quot; he spat with all the venom he could muster in voice.  The warden let out a little chuckle, &quot;I think you will.  Do you recognize this?&quot; He asked pushing a glass cup the size of a low ball towards edge of desk in front of Samuel.  The glass was sealed with a cap.  Inside in a clear liquid floated a round golf ball size pale oval, with a similar shade tube coming from it and floating above it leaking a small amount of red liquid, blood maybe.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what the fuck that is&quot; Samuel announced, &quot;and I don&#39;t know why I should fucking care.&quot;  The warden, still smiling, asked &quot;you don&#39;t want to guess? I&#39;ll give you a hint you use to have two of them but now one is sitting in a jar on my desk.&quot;  Samuel wasn&#39;t the brightest but it didn&#39;t take him too long to figure it out.  <br />
<br />
Samuel tried in vain to free his arms and reach down for his sack.  The restraints wouldn&#39;t give an inch.  He couldn&#39;t reach the paper gown that covered his body.  He wiggled his hips a bit, everything down there was numb.  He looked up at the warden the rage inside him building. He was too angry to even speak, all he could think of was beating the man in front of him to death.  He was seething as he stared at the warden who pushed another object towards Samuel next to the jar containing his nut.  It was about the same size as his ball, but looked clear with some computer circuits in it.  &quot;I invented this myself, and now you have one inside of you&quot; the warden declared, &quot;it broadcast a GPS signal that allows us to find you anytime anywhere, it provides us with a whole host of vital health information on you, it has the ability to deliver a debilitating electrical shock from inside you, and if need be or if exposed to the air it contains enough explosive to turn you into a small hole in the ground.&quot; The warden picked up a remote from his desk and pointed it at the TV. A New York newscast started playing, Samuel didn&#39;t take his eyes off the Warden but listened as the newscaster spoke about a jail bus crash that killed all of the prisoners onboard, the first name announced was Samuels, then the four other prisoners now at this facility.  This caught Samuels attention, he looked at the TV.  The newscast switched to what appeared to be a video taken at a bar, Samuel recognized the man speaking it was Luis, Samuels number 2.  Samuel listened as Luis spoke about what a good friend and leader Samuel was, other members of the Paynes were there, they were at the Paynes bar headquarters.  The warden spoke up, &quot;even if you were to get out of here, to the rest of the world, you&#39;re already dead.&quot;  Samuel was still mad, madder than he&#39;d ever been, but now for the first time he didn&#39;t know what to do.  Samuel heard the door open and for the third time felt a needle in his neck and for a third time the room went dark.</p>
