<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adi was grateful as the plane landed at Lyre and in a way she marveled at the sight of both Lyre and Animalia from the air. It made for a distinctive difference between the two towns that could easily be seen. There was some snow in places, but that still didn&#39;t change the aesthetics that Animalian design seemed to have and marked how Animalia was different from its sister town. Many of the buildings in Lyre were fairly typical for most human designs that often had a lot of square or rectangular shaped buildings, so as to better fit them on the grid for a standard layout. Animalia had some of that too, but from what she could see, many of the buildings that could be seen above ground in Animalia had more curves and rounded edges. In some ways, it made Animalia look organic when seen from the air. Adi was impressed with that.<br />
<br />
As she came down the ladder that had been brought up to the plane once it landed, though, Adi soon felt a shiver go down her spine and one that reminded her of what she&#39;d been trying to get away from. At the base of the ladder stood two men. One wore a white lab coat and struck Adi as a typical serious scientist, and she could note the word &quot;Horizon&quot; stitched above the left breast pocket on the lab coat. The other man, though, wore a dark suit and had a much more serious, and almost menacing look about him to Adi. She didn&#39;t know the man but she assumed he was an agent of the present US government.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Miss Adi,&quot; the man in the Horizon lab coat spoke, &quot;I&#39;m Doctor Stein, employed with Horizon Labs and this is Julius Striker... with the US State Department.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same State Department that in early 2016 agreed to accept my presence in America as a refugee to escape ISIS and then changed its mind in 2017 declaring that I was a &quot;known terrorist&quot; despite the fact that ISIS KILLED the rest of my family?&quot; Adi asked with narrowed and suspicious eyes at Striker.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the new and non-racist State Department that puts AMERICA first,&quot; Julius Striker answered, &quot;our security is important and we had to put those issues first and make sure that you aren&#39;t a threat... to us or the rightful government of Syria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your previous administration had me in a refugee came in Jordan  on the Syrian border for months doing that,&quot; Adi answered, &quot;then your country&#39;s government changes and I&#39;m automatically blocked as a supposed terrorist. Your administration is not acting to protect your country from threats to your country. Your administration is acting to prop up the dictator that has gassed his own people and allowed REAL terrorists to gain power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Striker was about to say something when Doctor Stein came between the two of them and kept one hand on Adi&#39;s shoulder while extending the other to block Striker from making any physical advance on the young woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless... I would think that all sides can claim some measure of success,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke and looked to Julius Striker, &quot;Your superiors can claim they protected the country.&quot; He then paused and looked to Adi, &quot;while your asylum case did go through and you will be safe to live in Animalia/Lyre and at some point to go through the naturalization process should you wish to be a US citizen at some point in the future. The rest is not worth arguing over.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, both Adi and Striker both backed down. Doctor Stein then quietly lead them toward the doors that would lead into the airport where Adi would have to wait for her baggage and what things she could bring with her. From there, there would be the trip to Horizon Labs and Adi&#39;s conversion.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The ride to Horizon was relatively quiet as Adi rode with Doctor Stein and followed him in. Julius Striker followed in his own vehicle, and Adi was still creeped out by him in a way. In that sense, Striker only reminded her of Syria&#39;s government which had a habit of being involved as much as it could in the lives of people, which Adi felt had fueled at least part of the fury that had lead to ISIS. Thankfully though, once they got to the transformation room, Striker remained out in the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your formula is specifically with the Arabian?&quot; Adi asked as Doctor Stein raised her sleeve to prepare for the injections that had been part of her acceptance into the US.<br />
<br />
Part of the initial deal had been more that she would be accepted on asylum status to escape the fighting in Syria. The only thing that actually helped her was that as Animalia grew larger and more successful, her asylum status was renewed on the condition that she become an Animalian. It wasn&#39;t exactly that Adi truly wanted to be part animal, but she DID want to get away from the rampant violence and political murder that went on in Syria. Thus, she made her choice on that basis and Lyre/Animalia were the farthest away from the woes of the Middle East. She ultimately went with the Arabian breed of horse for its beauty and the fact that was a horse that was well known to her people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke as he delivered the first injection, &quot;and specifically from a white Arabian. Now, your hair color will probably remain the same, as Animalians that have kept their human hair have seen no change in their hair color.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Adi answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as your transformation progresses, you may wish to disrobe while you&#39;re in private, as while the Arabian isn&#39;t a large breed of horse... it is larger than a person and as such you will grow in size,&quot; Doctor Stein informed her, &quot;and welcome to Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adi was already feeling warm as Doctor Stein delivered the second injection and then left the room. She slowly looked down to see white hairs pushing up out of her arm and thickening into white fur. In this she smiled and set about preparing for the rest of her transformation, especially as her shoes and socks were beginning to grow rather tight around her feet. She managed to undo the laces, though with some difficulty as she watched her fingers grow bulkier and more muscular and her fingernails growing ticker and sturdier on top of them, almost if a hoof tipped each finger. She couldn&#39;t marvel at it, as her feet were really getting cramped in her shoes, not to mention that she could feel all her muscle groups growing as well.<br />
<br />
She managed to get her shoes off to see that her feet were rapidly lengthening into the long digitigrade feet that many Animalians had and that her toes were slowly merging together as if to form a long single toe tipped with a hoof. She shakily got onto her feet and could hear the &quot;clop&quot; of her hooves hitting the tiled floor, and that made her ears move slightly.  She reached up and could soon feel her ears, they were covered in fur and were growing taller and stood out higher above he head, even while her pants, shirt, and undergarments were already getting tight on her. In this, she knew her transformation was accelerating as she become more and more like Animalia&#39;s various Horse Animalians. <br />
<br />
With that she began struggling to get out of her pants and shirt. Her pants came off fine, revealing lean but well muscled legs along with widening hips and a slightly expanding posterior, but as she got to her shirt, things became a bit more complicated. Her neck began to lengthen a bit as she pulled her shirt up and for a moment or two she struggled with her shirt and eventually with growing strength she ended up ripping it. As her head was exposed to the light again, Adi could also look down a modest wedge shaped muzzle. Like the rest of her fur it was white and she could see her now larger nostrils flare slightly, though from her position she also felt that her growing muzzle was smaller than some of the other Horse Animalians, but then that was also another distinctive feature of the Arabian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost done,&quot; Adi thought to herself as she felt herself becoming more and more invigorated, especially as her growing bust and butt began to test her underwear.<br />
<br />
At this point, Adi really didn&#39;t care and reached down to her panties and managed to fit a finger inside the material on the sides of her hips and then pulled outward to the side and leading to her underwear ripping at the seams and releasing some of the pressure that had been there. The best feeling was at the base of her spine where Adi turned to look over her shoulder to see her tail growing out with long black hairs, matching her human hair. She swayed it slightly and it did well. At the same time, the wire clasps on the back of her bra finally gave way to the swelling white furred orbs that where her breasts. She ended up giving a slight nicker as she managed to slip her arms out of the bra&#39;s straps and stood there in the middle of the room as a naked Arabian Mare Animalian and feeling fairly pleased and confident with herself. She blushed beneath her fur a bit at the drops of milk that seemed to be leaking from her erect nipples, but then she had seen plenty of reports that discussed Animalian libido and physical conditions.</p>
