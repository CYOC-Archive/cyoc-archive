<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What was that one involving full power at the sacrifice of becoming evil?&quot; you ask, remembering the incantations you reviewed earlier. Graham looks around and finds the one labeled &quot;Ultimate Power for the Ultimate Being&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he says, reading it over, &quot;I think that's for me,&quot; he stands himself back up and smiles. &quot;If your spell gives you the power to do anything you want, than this one not only bestows me with those powers, but the ability to consume mortals in exchange for more power, more control...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think you're strong enough to contain it?&quot; you ask, knowing in your godlike, omnipotent mind that the power will consume and transcend Graham into a the darkest of all evils. &quot;I doubt it,&quot; Graham humbly admits, &quot;but who cares, we'd be the most powerful beings in the universe. I can play the bad cop, and actually mean it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of it caused Graham's still human mind to get excited, and he couldn't contain the naked erection growing on him again. &quot;If you have to consume humans to keep up your power, my powers will continue to grow even without consumption. But unlike you I will be compelled to destroy. To possess. To rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of it was exciting, even to you. But a small worry subsisted, even with your godlike mind. &quot;With my new powers I can forsee a lot of things,&quot; you add, &quot;but I can't forsee what you will become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Graham turns back around, the excitement of becoming a power-ridden beast too excited for him to handle. &quot;I think I should do it, together we can rule world!&quot; and he bends back down to read the inscription.<br />
<br />
If it's powers of evil you wish to receive<br />
Recite what follows and let it become your creed<br />
Fire and ice may bestow the earth<br />
But to control them infinite will be your rebirth<br />
A creature of horns you will have to endure<br />
And nude now and forever you will allure<br />
To transform into beings both physical and beyond<br />
Mere mortals will forever be of you fond<br />
Without a sacrifice and without the need to feed<br />
These powers will be with you forever, infinite indeed<br />
But your mind will curse, a different god you will become<br />
You will never know yourself, from foot to thumb<br />
But continue this simple spell, if bare from head to toe<br />
<br />
At this Graham looks over at you, a look of excitement, &quot;bein' naked is one thing I can be sure of...&quot;<br />
<br />
But you aren't quite so excited, &quot;did you hear what it said about horns, man? Even my powers can't transform you back if you become that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what I'm doing,&quot; Graham says, flexing his body in eager anticipation. He continues, re-standing his naked self at the end of the spell:<br />
<br />
But continue this simple spell, if bare from head to toe<br />
And allow our powers of darkness into you flow<br />
<br />
A bright flash and the pentagram turns not white as it did for you, but a thick black and purple, dark as the darkest of night. Graham looks down, wide smile slowly fading as he sees glimpse of pure evil rise up from the pentagram and, in a black smoke of shadow and darkness, raise and encircle him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man,&quot; he says not in excitement but in fear, &quot;I don't know if I'm ready for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike with you, the dark cloud aggressively encircles him as if in lust it's ready to invade his body. Graham stands only because of his sheer fear to move. &quot;What's happening...to...me?!&quot; he shouts before the darkness barrows into his ass and penis before invading the other orifices in his body. &quot;ARGH!&quot; he shouts in pain, &quot;Oh god...make it stop!&quot; he says as the black power reaches into his body. &quot;This isn't who I am!&quot; he shouts, &quot;make it...stop, argh!&quot; bending over in pain you watch the power engulf him as his muscles begin to ingest the power.<br />
<br />
His back starts rumbling as if there's a large worm underneath his flesh before boiling up and forming new layers of muscle over his body. You can tell Graham is not in a feeling of pleasure, however. &quot;Argh!&quot; he says again as his pecs buckle out and his abs form a deep eight pack. &quot;My mind...&quot; he says in worry, &quot;it's...going...&quot;<br />
<br />
You raise our arms up in an attempt to use your own powers to stop the madness, to stop the evil. But the altar is too powerful, it's too much even for your godlike abilities. <br />
<br />
Cracking and bending ensues as Graham's legs lengthen and bulk up, 2, 3 times the size of yours, &quot;AHHHH!&quot; he shouts as his shins broaden and feet grow. As muscle continues to envelop you notice his skin becoming a thick, leathery black and grey. &quot;Argh!&quot; he shouts again, &quot;I can't, brreeatthhhe!&quot; his voice deepens multiple octaves as his skin thickens and muscles contort. His torso grows as it becomes skinnier, thick muscles still in tact. &quot;I can't...think! ARGH!&quot; as bones grow out of his elbows, forming sharp, knife like objects. &quot;I know not who I am, I am...I can feel the evil reaching me, it's taking over me, I can't...help it...feels so much...feels so...&quot; at this you hear Graham's voice loosen to pleasure, but not the same as your's. This lust is of pure evil...&quot;good. Yes...YES...YES!!! HAHA...grrr, arcghhhhrrrr&quot; his speech becomes indecipherable as he continues to transform. His hair receeds as two horns do in fact grow out of his temple. His face cracks and elongates as his shoulders thicken so much they look like they're going to bust.<br />
<br />
When they do, two large, bat-like wings emerge. The creature, who's voice is now so low it's nearly out of human hearing range, begins to laugh. &quot;Argh hahaha!&quot; it screams as muscle continues to grow. You know this thing is certainly no longer Graham. It's become something else. Something that truly is pure evil.<br />
<br />
Graham's large and now black package begins to grow as his fingers elongate and quads both widen and lengthen. His balls grow a thick scrotum that aligns and holds itself tight against his body. His penis elongates like an erection but flattens out to resemble a deadly and torturous blade. &quot;ARGH HAHAHAH!&quot; the creature continues to laugh as the same bolts of power flow into him. But this power truly was evil. Graham is quickly becoming master of the darkest of all powers, and this creature is all there is to show of it.<br />
<br />
The last of the power seeps into the creature as it lands back onto the alter, now nearly too tall for the chamber itself. It takes one deliberate breath and within a flash you know what it's going to do. You quickly fly your naked self out of the way of the black fire it attempts to breathe on you to destroy you, and in return you flash a bolt of electricity onto it, shocking it, causing it to scream in pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't fuck with me you twerp of a god, for I am the ultimate being!&quot; it says directly into your mind. Using its wings it flies itself directly into the roof of the chamber and in one swoop flees the haunted manor, flying off toward the moon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, what have we done?&quot; you say.</p>
