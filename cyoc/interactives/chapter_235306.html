<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chet had just experienced sex as a woman, he had felt a cock penetrate his no HER body she had loved it. He felt something vibrating in the room, inside his wardrobe it was the jewelry box with the ankle chain he had brought for Sarah. He somehow knew that she had been lying about being on the pill. He also could sense her thoughts, she had had two periods. She was ovulating, she was dreaming. No, she knew the sperm was passing through her body to her womb. Tom, that was the guy&#39;s name, was at the Atlanta college on a football scholarship. Sarah, Chet could now separate his thoughts from hers, gambled on the urge to fuck her being stronger than the rhythm method.<br />
<br />
Sarah had lied to Tom, she was on the pill but not a birth control one, she was taking fertility pills. She stood in front of the mirror nude and imagined her belly swelling with his baby, she wanted twins. A boy and a girl. That would be a real blessing, didn&#39;t the Bible tell people to multiple? Well she had gambled on Tom cuming, pun intended, too late to reverse the process by pulling out. It was her body and she wanted his babies, she had lied to get to the finish line. He was dating some blond big chested bimbo called Paige, who was a golfer with a DD bust. That was fine, she wasn&#39;t going to chase Tom for paternity payments. She had once worked for a Republican politician and the hush money was huge. She would raise this child as a single mother. Maybe co-parent with Tom if he showed any interest.<br />
<br />
Chet decided to put the ankle chain on to stop the storm of thoughts going through his head. Suddenly the thoughts coming from the Sarah was silenced like hitting the mute button. Chet went back to sleep. Over the next few days he forgot about his chain as he called it. Maybe because the blessing made him forget. He wore socks over the top so it never came up. However a few days in he went to shave and noticed his five o&#39;clock shadow was not an issue. His normal shaving routine wasn&#39;t necessary. He mentally frowned but soon the blessing went to work making him feel happy, forgetting Sarah. <br />
<br />
When Sarah&#39;s tryst with Tom didn&#39;t produce the goods, apparently he did know when to pull out, she tried desperately to patch things up with Chet. She even showed up at his room wearing a coat and racy lingerie underneath. She had chosen a red push up bra and matching thong. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Chet, I just was scared of commitment. I will do whatever you want to make this work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chet was blanked faced staring at her barely clad body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just jealous, that Tom has a really great ass.&quot; Chet replied and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Sarah stood there in her push up bra, trying to make her B cups look like a C at least. The makeup, the time she had spent on making herself as irresistible as possible and Chet just told her that he was jealous over Tom&#39;s ass. Chet was a lot of things, gay wasn&#39;t one of them. She felt like she had been given a spiked drink. Sarah&#39;s thinking was fine and then it was just blank. She was ready to let Chet have his way with her but he just turned his back on her. But as she pulled on the coat around her petite frame she couldn&#39;t help but notice his face looked softer and his voice sounded high in pitch, was he injecting estrogen or something? <br />
<br />
Chet went to mirror the next morning and noticed that his cheeks were higher and his face wasn&#39;t as angular as before. His mind was numb to the changes he thought he looked cute. The chain was still around his ankle working its magic or blessing. As he pulled on his underwear he found that the seat didn&#39;t fit around his plumper ass. Someone was putting junk in his trunk. He frowned like he was trying to remember something. He hadn&#39;t had any boners since Sarah had made love to Tom, he didn&#39;t used words like fuck anymore as they were too crude for her tastes. Chet decided to go free and let it all hand out, he somehow knew that a good looking woman wouldn&#39;t give him a tent in the front of his pants. His hip were wider as well, well he didn&#39;t mind looking more feminine anymore. <br />
<br />
When he was in the shower he noticed that his torso looked far less hairy than before and his chest was narrower, like when he was an underdeveloped teen. His nipples seemed larger, more sensitive being the size of silver half dollars. Something told him to stay inside, he sent messages and claimed he was out of Georgia due to a sick relative. Instead he spent time looking at his changes every hour or so. It had been two days since he had put on the chain and about half a day since he had told Sarah she was lucky. His pecs had started to soften and become jiggly. He now had the profile, side on of a woman. The small size of his breasts and his shapely legs could have any man mistaking him for a woman. Except for that ugly penis he still had, he wondered how his ass would look nude, you could bounce a quarter off of it! He giggled.</p>
