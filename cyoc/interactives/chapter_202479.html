<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa regarded the glob of rat semen rolling down the inside of her thigh for a moment, then looked up, back at her reflection.<br />
<br />
She turned back to Eric and squeaked, &quot;So rat cum will turn me into a rat!?&quot;, her tone was nervous, excited; it made Eric&#39;s eyebrow rise in confusion. He nodded.<br />
<br />
She bounced on her slightly elongated feet, soft breasts jiggling and bouncing, as she clapped her hands in front of her. &quot;Oh man, I&#39;m gonna guzzle so much rat cum so! TomTom my love, I&#39;ll be your perfect little mate!&quot;. She beamed, buck teeth clacking. As what was happening dawned on Eric and he sat back down at the Chronivac with an &quot;Oooookay&quot;, all while Lisa scooped up the dribbling cum from her thigh with two fingers and with a satisfied *smack* sucked them clean.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s fingers danced over the keyboard as Lisa spun with giddy energy, singing, &quot;Ratty Lisa, Ratty Lisa, Ratty...&quot; She stopped dead as Eric typed the final keys and hit enter with a flourish.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Aaaand there we are. Mental and moral filters reset back to original levels. Sorry babe, forgot you had the &#39;love TomTom&#39; mode still on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa immediately flushed deep red and paused, slowly turning to the mirror again. &quot;Oh...This...&quot; she paused for a moment, clearly choosing her words. &quot;How do I turn back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric made a *one moment* gesture, then started frantically clicking and typing around the Chronivac program. As he searched Lisa went back to watching herself in the mirror. A slightly curvier, squatter frame that she was used to looked back, with unusually large ears, powerful buck teeth, weirdly long feet, and of course her bizarre three sets of extra nipples. She didn&#39;t know how to feel about being some sort of mutant freak.<br />
<br />
Behind her, Eric made an awkward apologetic noise. &quot;Eh... oh... &#39;irreversible baseline DNA hybridisation between users and non-sapient due to intake of reproductive fluids is a known bug of the Chronivac Software. No bugfix has been successfully implemented to date and no more work is being carried out in this space. We recommend that our users do not engage in ingestion of reproductive fluids of non-sapient species without first selecting the &quot;Scrub fluids&quot; filter. filter can be found on menu... blah blah... Yadda Yadda... Chronivac TM would like to remind its customers as per terms and conditions, all irreversible changes are the responsibility of the user and the Chronivac corporation can not be held liable for... etc etc... well bugger&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric let that hang in the air for a long time before Lisa said in a tiny voice, &quot;So I&#39;m stuck like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry babe.&quot; Eric started, &quot;I should never have gotten you to...&quot;. Lisa stopped him with a raised palm, her mouth drew a tight line, &quot;No no... animal sex is my kink. you were just being a good boyfriend, finding me a way of doing it without getting into trouble. And I...&quot;. She paused, looking over at Tom-Tom&#39;s cage and allowing herself a small smile. &quot;I did really enjoy the experience, kink validated, our little rat buddy is quite the stud.&quot; She sighed then, face falling as she looked back down at her changed torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re okay with this babe?&quot; Eric asked. Lisa pursed her lips in thought. &quot;I don&#39;t know... I mean, &quot;She raised her arms and turned. &quot;I&#39;m not exactly some inhuman monster. I just look a bit... odd, and way shorter than I&#39;m used to. I&#39;m sure I could hide it.&quot; She paused again, then cursed. &quot;Ah fuck, all my clothes are never going to fit me now.&quot; She slapped her hand against her forehead. &quot;Gah... I think I just need to sleep on this babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded. &quot;Of course Lis! This is a lot to take in. I understand. Want me to... ehm. Make some adjustments about how others perceive you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa weighed her options for a moment. &quot;I&#39;d rather not mess with the Chronivac too much again with me as the centre. Can you like, do the bare minimum maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded, &quot;Of course Lis, there&#39;s a solid, &#39;Current changes as normal&#39;  button that just normalises all user changes to everyone else. Been there since day one. It&#39;s a safe bet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded, &quot;Alright, do that so. Gonna go home and go sit on this for the night.&quot; She stood on her tippy-toes, and gave Eric a kiss he had to lean down for, and was mostly lips on buck teeth. &quot;I&#39;ll call you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Throwing her now massive hoodie over her head and wearing it like a thigh length dress, Lisa strode barefoot out the room, glancing back at Tomtom on the way.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Car lights strobed through the shutters of Lisa&#39;s window. Bright stripes racing across her ceiling as she lay in bed. Wide awake for hours. Mulling the past two days over in her mind.<br />
<br />
Now that her moral filters were back to her normal levels, she had a lot of introspection and self reflection to do. Her mind was roiling storm of conflicting emotions and thoughts, born of two days of living with no moral or emotional filters, and a heightened sense of lust and belonging to an animal. It was a lot to compartmentalise and sort through. It kept her wide awake.<br />
<br />
It was mostly down to what she knew what emotions were always there, what ones were likely brought to light due to her mental modifications, and which were completely new, developed purely because of experiences she&#39;d never have had if not for the Chronivac. What was she, what is she, what would the have been, and what could she have been?<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaargh&quot;. She groaned, turning and tossing. Blankets long discarded in the heat, blond hair mussed and in her face. She sucked on her bottom lip under her prominent buck teeth, an affectation she&#39;d only developed earlier that day.<br />
<br />
The most troubling and difficult memories to sort through were those right before the return of her filters. Driven further and further past all moral and personal boundaries, mentally changed into loving an animal, and confronted with an insane reality that she could irrevocably, irreversibly, morph her body into a rat, Lisa had been ready to jump at that with glee. She could remember thinking it. Remember thinking that she should trick Eric away from the Chronivac, get hold of it, and find some way of speeding up the process.<br />
<br />
She shuddered now at the thought, but still couldn&#39;t work out was it a shudder of relief, or a shudder of regret.<br />
<br />
Turning again, this time to her side, her body shifted onto the edge of her widened hip, arching her back and sides in a way she wasn&#39;t used to in bed. Thighs pressed together, she felt the burn, deep inside her. A good, satisfying burn.<br />
<br />
That was one thing she&#39;d squared away early. She&#39;d always had a kink at the thought of animal sex, though primarily dogs and horses had lived in that space; now, post her mad adventure, she knew the fetish had been very quickly validated. It felt so unbelievably kinky, and naughty, and it had felt Oh. So. Good. at the time. Each time. There was no heightened senses or mental manipulation in her orgasms. They, she knew, were 100% genuine; and the best she&#39;d ever felt.<br />
<br />
Memories.<br />
Soft fur. On her back. Surrounding her.<br />
Nipples hard against her pyjamas. Top set tenting the fabric, the rest rubbing agonisingly as the fabric pulled taut.<br />
<br />
A heavy weight, on her back. Being owned. Her skin tingled, blood rushes and memories return.<br />
The feeling. The feeling of fullness. The pressure and the release.<br />
<br />
Lisa was wet. Oh so wet again. It took so little. Tongue snaked out over buck teeth as she pressed her arms together, across her chest. Sighing softly. She remembered something. Sent on request by Eric yesterday.<br />
<br />
Her phone lit up the dark of her face. Thumb muting the volume as she found the target. A video taken of her first shrinkage; and of her first time fucking TomTom. She fast forwarded to the penetration. She looked in rapture, and she remembered how good it felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnnnnhhh... fuck...&quot;. She was so scarlet, she was so confused.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s dreams that night were wild, flashes of the past two days, along with imagined scenes pulled from the deepest darkest recesses of her mind. So depraved they were, that twice she awoke in shameful mind-shattering orgasm.<br />
<br />
The first time her dreams woke her she was gleefully making love to a sized-up TomTom. In her kitchen. With her horrified parents present. All while she gleefully cackled and moaned with delight.<br />
<br />
Not only was she delighted with her animal lovemaking in this dream, but she also kept rubbing it in her parents faces. Screaming obscenities like.<br />
&quot;Look at your, beautiful, clever, perfect daughter now, nothing but a rat-slut!!!&quot; or, &quot;Hope you&#39;re ready for lots of ratling grandkids, mom&quot;. The dream ended with TomTom unloading into her and her belly swelling to obscene proportions, and with her waking orgasm, four fingers buried deep within her own dribbling snatch.<br />
<br />
After what seemed an age she finally drifted off, only for a second, wilder dream to take its place. This second dream had her taking part in a school runway catwalk. Only instead of modelling clothes, she was modelling her naked self. Starting fully human at one end of the runway, people gasped in surprise and embarrassment at Lisa&#39;s nakedness.<br />
<br />
Lisa was mortified, naked in front of all these people, she crossed her arms in front of her chest, covering her vulnerable self. People began to laugh openly and Lisa, feeling sick, stumbled forward. The stumble took her a few stups down the runway. Each unintended step, however brought a tingling sensation to her feet and hands. It felt warm, and comforting. <br />
<br />
Momentarily distracted by the feeling, Lisa let her eyes drift down to her feet and paused as her eyes boggled. There, she could see her toes had morphed, lengthening half their normal length, and her nails had sharpened and curved into little black claws. Letting her hands drift from covering her chest she stared at her fingers and saw that the same claws now tipped her fingers. <br />
<br />
Though the crowd still howled with laughter, she was momentarily distracted and curious. Turning her hands in front of her she took another step down the runway. This time she felt a warm sensation under her nose, in her upper jaw, and a wonderful stretching sensation. She felt her upper incisors pushing out over her bottom lip. She brought her claw tipped fingers to her teeth and tapped the new growths. <br />
<br />
&quot;How weird.&quot; she thought, and took another step, to the baying laughter and jeers of the crowd. She really wanted to see what would happen if she took more steps. her next two steps made her nose tingle and the stretching sensation radiate to her nose, she watched cross eyed as her nose extended some two inches. It felt good, like her face was being released from a lifetime of constraint. Right around the time that she noticed how hairy the back of her arms had gotten, was right around the time that the shouts and jeers changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is wrong with Lisa?&quot; Someone yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god that&#39;s fucking disgusting. She some kind of mutant.&quot; someone else called.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m gonna be sick.&quot; the last person called, as the calls turned more unsettled.<br />
<br />
Lisa though, unperturbed, marvelled at her changing body, feeling like something inside her that was always there was being released. Smiling she began striding with purpose. Her whole body came alight in sensations as she strode. Every nerve burning in agonising release.<br />
<br />
The unsettled tones became panicky now. Calls of,<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, she&#39;s a monster.&quot; And &quot;Look at that filthy animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is she smiling?&quot; Came one call that stopped Lisa and made her take stock<br />
<br />
Looking down over her new furry muzzle she could see her morphed body. Like some sort of furry anthopomorphic half-rat creature. Eight small breasts poked out from brown fur, and a tail swished behind her. Between her legs her shifted rat-pussy burned and dribbled. She ran her knobbly paws down her front, relishing the curve of every breast while laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m smiling because I&#39;m happy. Happy I&#39;m an animal, a filthy animal.&quot; She topped.<br />
<br />
Someone yelled, &quot;You&#39;re not human! You&#39;re fucking disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
An excited feeling bubbled in Lisa at those words. He was right, she wasn&#39;t human. She was happy not being human. She didn&#39;t want to be human. She had to voice that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am disgusting. A disgusting Rat.&quot; She jeered. Seeing how uncomfortable the crowd were made her excited. She wanted to show off now. Long paws standing wide she spread her legs and pulled her furry lips apart. The crowd gasped and Lisa felt a wet string of grool dribble down to the floor beneath her.<br />
<br />
&quot;A disgusting, horny, rat.&quot; She dipped two fingers into her rat snatch, before bringing her wet pink fingers to her new muzzle and awkwardly sucking her rat juices from them.<br />
<br />
People in the crowd balked now, moaning in disgust. Jeering, &quot;Disgusting rat&quot; and &quot;Filth&quot;. But that just sent her to new excited highs.<br />
<br />
Dropping to her knees she moaned loudly. One hand diving back into her snatch, the other slipped around her furry cheeks to slip a pointed finger into her puckered rat-anus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss. Yes-yes. Disgusting rat. Filthy&quot; She hissed. There humans were beneath her. Beneath such a sexy creature. She was a wonderful, sexy, perfect, disgusting, filthy rat. Her fingers began working overtime as the crowd shouted in horror and disgust, while she drove herself ever onward, mimicking their calls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Smelly filthy rat. Hnnngh, filthy disgusting creature. Not human. Yeeessss, yes-yes!&quot; Something was happening to her. To her mind, she knew disgusting filthy rats didn&#39;t care about school, or people, or parents. Just sex and breeding, just like her. With glee she was letting those old human feelings drift away. Speech becoming more and more broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes-yes. Lisa Rat! Perfect filthy Rat. Lisa more perfect now, more perfect than any of you.&quot; She began jilling herself frantically, feeling release was near. &quot;Yess! Sexy rat. Will fuck many sexy rat. Lisa perfect. Rat Liiiisssaaa peeeerrr...<br />
<br />
...fectt.&quot; She wailed in orgasm. Waking up from her dream in a ball of orgasmic sweat. Hips bucking as her hands continued to ride her through her orgasm. It took a good few seconds before the hammering in her ears died down enough that she could hear the other hammering. That from the wall she shared with her older sister&#39;s bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you twerp! Rat Lisa perfect?! What the fuck is that. You&#39;re fucking disgusting.&quot; A voice hissed from behind the drywall.<br />
<br />
Scarlet in embarrassment Lisa buried her face in her pillow. But something in the threat from the other bedroom triggered something from her dream. <br />
<br />
Maybe she was disgusting. But so what. What if disgusting was good?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Lisa whispered, staring at the ceiling again.</p>
