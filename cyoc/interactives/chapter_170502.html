<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>3rd person from now on — let&#39;s call our main character Jeremy, arbitrarily.<br/>
(Also, I realize wearing tacky looking glasses is a hard tf trigger when the one wearing them doesn&#39;t know anything changed, so feel free to have the magic of the glasses change their form to contacts, or just color his eyes green so he uses them more without realizing)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeremy got home, he let out a heavy sigh. A second car was parked — crookedly parked, too — on the curb outside his house, and he instantly recognized it as belonging to his brother&#39;s annoying friend, Alex. And if one friend was here, chances are the others were too. Grimacing, he walked in the door, kicked off his shoes, and padded up the stairs to the second floor where his and his brothers rooms were. There was also a third door which led to what his parents called &quot;the den,&quot; but was really just a room with a beat up old couch, a TV, and a gaming console.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, he could hear laughter, swearing, and what sounded like muffled video game sound effects from behind the door to the game room. He ignored it, and walked into his room. He had school tomorrow, and that meant homework. He walked to his desk, and then...frowned. His laptop was missing. He quickly checked his backpack and the other places he tended to leave it, but it wasn&#39;t in any of them either. Groaning, he realized he was going to have to talk to his brother.<br />
<br />
Jeremy walked out into the hallway, and unceremoniously banged on the door to the den.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan?&quot; he called, &quot;Get our here, I need my laptop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have it,&quot; came the muffled reply, and Jeremy scowled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do, you took it last week. Come find it or I&#39;m digging through your stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffled cursing and a burst of laughter came from behind the door as Evan got up, and, in a moment, it opened to reveal his annoyed face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. S&#39;not my fault I keep taking it, though. Your screen&#39;s better, mom and dad should replace my old one anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy was about to respond, but Luke, another one of Evan&#39;s friends, interrupted him by calling out from deeper in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ev, can you grab some more beers while you&#39;re in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, gave Jeremy one last disgruntled look, then shut the door behind him and walked over to his own room. A moment later he reemerged, and unceremoniously half through the laptop into Jeremy&#39;s hands before heading back into the room and crouching down in front of a mini fridge to pick out the beers.<br />
<br />
Jeremy scowled. At 19, Evan was older than him by two years, and their admittedly pretty lax parents wouldn&#39;t like it if they found out he was hoarding beer in his room. Jeremy was sometimes tempted to tell on him, but the last time he&#39;d ratted his brother out about something he&#39;d made his life a living hell for a week after. His brother was the kind of asshole Jeremy seemed to attract, who had a knack for getting out of trouble with some combination of good looks, brawn, and sheer dumb luck. Carefully, Jeremy opened the computer, and froze. The keyboard was splattered with a dry, yellowish white stain.<br />
<br />
Seething, Jeremy slammed the laptop shut, and stormed back into his own room. So his computer had a &quot;better screen,&quot; huh? He knew what his brother used the laptop for, or had guessed, but leaving his fucking cum on it was disgusting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan, hurry up!&quot; came an impatient voice from the gaming room, and Jeremy turned towards the door to look. And, at that moment, his eyes fell on the bag from the magic shop. The glasses.<br />
<br />
In that moment he made a split second decision, and grabbed the bag, quickly removing the glasses and putting them on before his brother had a chance to disappear into the den. He wasn&#39;t sure what exactly he expected them to do, but his douche of an older brother had gone too far. Something was...odd, though. While the lenses were decidedly pink, the view through the glasses looked normal. Well, almost normal...the very edges of his vision were colored an odd, faint lime green. For a moment Jeremy paused to wonder if they were supposed to look like that, but he didn&#39;t have time to dwell on it. A moment after he put the glasses on, Evan turned and started walking towards him down the hall on his way to the gaming room, two beers in each hand.<br />
<br />
Looking at his brother through the glasses, Jeremy felt, for probably the thousandth time, that it was utterly unfair that someone as annoying as Evan had won the genetic lottery. He was taller than Jeremy&#39;s own 5&#39;8&quot; by a good 6 inches, with sandy blond hair and rich brown eyes set in a tan and naturally handsome face. He was taking a gap year now, but he was set to go to college on a baseball scholarship, and had the body to prove it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice glasses, you look like a fuckin&#39; queer,&quot; Evan said, barking a laugh.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was about to snap back a reply, when suddenly his head began to ache slightly. He squinted his eyes, wondering if the tint of the glasses was causing it, but the feeling only grew more intense. As it reached its peak, he found his mind lingering on Evan...</p>
