<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took Tommy until the next weekend before he found someone he would like to replace his father. Surprisingly he had decided to turn their ever grumpy neighbors into parts of the family. He would turn their son Brian into the new family father. Being only eight years old Tommy would have to age the boy up, but he liked his personality, with was good despite his parents ranting.<br />
But what to do with the parents and the older son? He didn´t need more than one other sibling and also didn´t want another pet beside Franky yet. After thinking some time he had a funny idea what to do with the last member of their family.<br />
He set the chronivac up so that the four of them would come over. At the moment he was alone at home, his mother at work and Rick with a friend. He escorted them into the living room before he let them freeze up completely and started their changes with Brian.<br />
<br />
Brian grew older until he was forty like Tommys mother. He was a bit bigger than her and gained a few pounds, letting him look a bit rounder. Tommy increased Brian&#39;s intelligence to a level fitting for his new age and transferred the knowledge of Brian&#39;s father David about being a business man to him so he could take his fathers job, only being nicer to his colleagues than his father had been. Brian would remember going to school with Tommys mother Gwen before falling in love and later marring her. Then Gwen would get pregnant first with Tommy, than with Rick and finally with Jenny. His short, old life was buried deep into his head, never to resurface again. <br />
Jenny, Brian&#39;s old mother and David, Brian&#39;s old father begun to move closer to each other, finally touching each other. But it didn´t stop there, they started merging with each other, forming a feminine mix between them, called Danielle or Dany for short. The merged form then started to regress back into an five year old girl, Tommys and Ricks new younger sister. She gained a copy of Brian&#39;s old memories, which altered to fit into the new family of five, also changing her personality for the better. Like her former sons their old memories were stored away deep in her head, and to the world both of their old lifes have never existed. Finally they would both be slightly obedient to Tommy just like Rick.<br />
<br />
With them dealt with Tommy turned to Richard, unfreezing his head. Richard looked around, not recognizing his brother or parents but the only person in the world beside Tommy to remember them ever existing. &quot;Why am I here?&quot; he asked confused. &quot;Oh I just invited you to have a little fun with me, Richard.&quot; Tommy answered grinning before he started the changes for him.<br />
Richard suddenly felt a pull in his body with than slowly glided towards the tv in the room. The moment he touched the screen he was slowly sucked in. &quot;What is happening to me?” he asked panicked after his body below his ass had been sucked in. &quot;I have fun with you. You will be imprisoned in the tv. Your body will always act like you are part of the program, replacing one actor. Switching the channel means switching your role in there. The same goes for videos or games. The only time you can act on your own is when there is no program but the tv is active. But only me will notice you then. And if the tv is turned off you will fall asleep until it is turned on again.&quot; While Tommy explained Richards body was sucked in further. By the time Tommy finished only Richards head remained outside, looking horrified at him. But before he could respond anything his mouth was already behind the screen. A single tear remained on the screen after Richard was fully sucked into the tv.<br />
<br />
Tommy then unfroze Brian and Dany. While Brian drove to work with the old car of Richard now his, Dany watched tv together with Tommy, some series about a princess. Tommy laughed to himself seeing Richard in the role of the princess because she was the only role he could take. When Rick returned home later they switched to the game system and played together, Richard always in the role of an enemy of them. Tommy laughed a lot through the game for all the roles Richard had to play. Richard learned that he could do nothing on his own but was affected by his surroundings. He could use all his senses and later when Tommy played alone he often would be the monsters Tommys character fought, he also learned that no matter what happened with the role he took he couldn´t die, only feel the immense pains of the process. And he had learned what happened to his younger brother by linking the him to the new family father, who had the same name and a similar face, only older. As for his parents Tommy told him later that they had merged into his new younger sister Dany. And it broke something in him that they didn´t remember him when Tommy told him so before turning the tv off, putting him to sleep.</p>
