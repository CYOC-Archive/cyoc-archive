<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Thanks to... me?!&quot; Mark twitched his whiskers. &quot;If it wasn't for you raising the boy into a sissy, I wouldn't have had to be so hard on him! He needed to be a man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; June screamed. &quot;Look at you! You aren't even a man anymore, so don't presume to know what one is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark raised his hand to slap June and then realized his error too late, as his oft abused wife slammed a solid fist into his muzzle with terrible force, smashing his face hard enough to send him howling in pain to the grass.<br />
<br />
Waving her aching hand, June smiled in satisfaction. &quot;I like being the big one for once. Don't you ever raise a hand to me again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark could only sit knocked on his ass cowering. His whole world and all his power had just crumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also...&quot; June kneeled down to Mark's ear, &quot;You haven't made me cum for 15 years.&quot; She spat in his face. &quot;Selfish rat bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
As little as she was, as weird as all of it was, June smiled proudly and stood confidently over her crushed husband/rat like she was 50 feet tall, ignoring everything else but his fearful gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; Ty blinked twice, his gaze turning from the small scale domestic violence to Wendy's bewildered stare. &quot;Looks like they've got a long way to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So!&quot; Wendy shuffled awkwardly. &quot;Dustin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes! My pachyderm step brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
In unison, both Wendy and Ty turned to the elephant, who had tried to sneak off unnoticed rather unsuccessfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Ty hollered. &quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin hung his head sadly and turned around, waiting for his inevitable turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back here!&quot; Ty barked.<br />
<br />
With thundering steps, the elephant comically obeyed, standing in front of Ty with nervous fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And lastly, you. The big stupid jock with the overinflated ego.&quot; A light bulb seemed to shine over Ty's head. &quot;Overinflated.&quot; He shot Wendy an 'I'm-thinking-something-evil' smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're free to go.&quot; Ty waved the elephant off. &quot;You've been punished enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though startled, and rightly fearing some kind of trick, Dustin was his old stupid self, and with relief he plodded towards the driveway.<br />
<br />
A sharp snap and a hiss from his rear brought Dustin back to alarm. He suddenly felt stiff... very stiff. Suddenly he couldn't move, and suddenly he felt light headed. Sleepy. Tired. He dozed off right there, fading away to nothingness.<br />
<br />
Wendy stared at the giant solid gray latex elephant balloon standing on the sidewalk and blinked. &quot;You... turned him into a balloon animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The remnants of the surrounding crowd were now at a full tilt run away from the area and more than likely the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled at Wendy and sighed happily. &quot;That felt good.&quot; He admitted. &quot;Weird, but good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy approached the life size elephant balloon and shook her head with a slight smirk. &quot;Are you going to leave them like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty walked up and stared up at Dustin's rubbery inflated body. &quot;Probably not, but let's make them suffer for a bit.&quot; He paused and kicked the balloon elephant's leg, causing the entire thing to shudder and fall gently onto its side. &quot;I want to jab a pin in him so bad. Stupid jerk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like you got your revenge, such as it is.&quot; Wendy giggled. &quot;Want to go do something else with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Wendy batted her eyelashes, smirking even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot; Ty shrugged. &quot;I'm a little lost right now.&quot; Somewhere, they could hear June and Mark fighting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, can I suggest something?&quot; The former waitress asked sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Ty brightened. &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy stood in front of the young demigod, and just smiled. She winked for emphasis.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at her uncomprehending for a moment, then blushed a deep red. &quot;Er, you don't mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy drew closer and took Ty's hand. &quot;Listen, today my shit life was changed by an adorable young man with godlike powers. I was a dumpy middle aged waitress with no hope and you've made me a young virile 15 year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blushed even more. &quot;Well, I... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned. &quot;You can't tell me you didn't think about that while you were watching me get younger.&quot; She paused, pulled Ty closer. &quot;Sexier. Look at me... young, curvy, just starting to become a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now Ty was sweating. He stood breathless, and gulped. He stared at Dustin for a moment, then back at Wendy. His mind had now melted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted this, you horny little boy.&quot; She grinned wider. &quot;I've been watching how you look at me. Your own girl, you're thinking. And just think, you can do whatever you want to me. Anything at all. And there's nothing that can say otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Ty repeated, shaking at the knees.<br />
<br />
Wendy drew her hand up to Ty's collar and jerked his shirt forward, pulling him in very close and practically pressing her lips to his. She let him feel her hot breath on his face. &quot;Your power is amazing. You're amazing. All my life I just wanted to be with somebody amazing.&quot; She paused dramatically, her eyes deepening with lust. &quot;I want you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty's eyes practically bugged out of his head. &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy's hands circled Ty's waist, she leaned in closer... and closer, pressing herself against him. Something hard and warm pressed against her thigh and she grinned madly. &quot;Think about it, you can make me your favorite fantasy, the thing you get off to, the thing you could only dream of before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty's blushing face grinned insanely. &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have experience too.&quot; She winked, and her free hand began undoing his belt.<br />
<br />
Ty gulped and stuttered. &quot;N-Now wait, wait a second!&quot;<br />
<br />
She dramatically whipped his belt off and placed her hand on his crotch. &quot;Oh? Don't you want me to give you your first blowjob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, never mind.&quot; Ty said at last. &quot;I'd like some of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical male.&quot; She grinned, and lowered his pants.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Whatever the fight had been about was lost on June and Mark. One minute they had been standing several feet away bickering for the last twenty minutes, oblivious to everything around them. Now they were staring wide eyed at a sight neither had anticipated.<br />
<br />
The shrunken Barbie sized maid June and her six inch tall rat husband stared in silent shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Mark said, finally blinking. &quot;She gives good head.&quot;</p>
