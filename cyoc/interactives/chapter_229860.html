<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while, Finn decides to choose the “continue on to the blacksmith” option, “I want to see if there are any other tasks to do,” he says to himself, “besides, I do need to find the blacksmith and get at least a knife for my character”.<br />
<br />
‘I think I’ll continue exploring the town and search for the blacksmith,’ Jeff thinks to himself when Finn taps the option, his thoughts appearing as italic writing in the text box of Finn’s screen.<br />
<br />
As Jeff continues on his way, he is oblivious to the fact that he and his decisions and actions are being chosen and controlled by his little brother, the teen is also unaware that the timer, he has set for how long he wishes to be in the game, has been put on hold until Finn decides to log out, that is when Jeff will regain control over himself, without realizing that he hadn’t had any control up to that point.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, young sir,” a text suddenly appears in the text box with “???” in the box next to it where usually a name should be, when Finn taps his screen. When Finn taps his screen a second time the 2D image of what appears to be an anthropomorphic Fox-man wearing a blue hooded robe appears on the right side of the screen. Jeff’s expression also changes into a more confused expression.<br />
<br />
“Who are you,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, my name is Tyler, Tyler O’Conner,” the Fox-man replies, “I don’t mean to bother you, but I couldn’t help but notice that you seem to be lost or looking for something. May I ask if I could be of any help to you?”<br />
<br />
When Finn taps his screen he sees two options:<br />
<br />
- Accept<br />
- Decline<br />
<br />
Finn chooses to accept the offer, which has Jeff say, “that would be really nice of you, mister O’Conner, sir. I am not from here and I’m kind of looking for a place to stay and I’d like to know if there is a blacksmith around here, I’d like to purchase a small knife or dagger”.<br />
<br />
The 2D snout of the Fox-man smiles when Finn taps his screen, “I’d be happy to help you with both of your problems,” he says, “first, let me lead you to the blacksmith, then I’ll help you find some place to stay”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “thank you, sir O’Conner,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tyler laughs, “no need to be so formal,” he says, “please, call me Tyler. I didn’t catch your name though”.<br />
<br />
“R-right, sorry,” Jeff says, “my name is Jeff, I’m an adventurer and just passing through, maybe find a task or quest to do to earn some money, I don’t have much currency”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Tyler says, “I might have a task for you, but let’s first head to the blacksmith, then we can talk possible business. Follow me,” so Jeff follows the anthropomorphic Fox down the streets of the town, the Fox-man pointing out a few things as they walk: a tavern, a clothing store, some guesthouses and inns which might have a room for Jeff.<br />
<br />
When Finn taps his screen the background changes to show the inside of a blacksmith’s shop: a large oven and some tools. Finn taps the screen again and the 2D image of a muscular human male wearing a leather apron appears, with Jeff and Tyler shown on the left side of the screen.<br />
<br />
“Welcome Tyler,” the man says, “who’s your companion?”<br />
<br />
“Greetings Mike,” Tyler replies, “this is Jeff, we’ve just met and I offered to show him around, he especially wanted to visit the local blacksmith to purchase something like a knife or dagger”.<br />
<br />
Mike the blacksmith turns to Jeff, “I see, so how much would you want to spend?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Jeff replies, “I mean… I don’t own much. I only have 200 gold, 300 silver and 500 copper coins, that’s all I have”.<br />
<br />
Mike thinks for a while, “hmm… let me see what I have,” he says.<br />
<br />
When Finn taps his screen he finds himself in a selection window, showing him images of knives and daggers to choose from with how much each cost bellow them. After scrolling through the daggers and knives, Finn decides to choose a medium sized dagger for 100 gold coins.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for your purchase, young Jeff,” Mike says when the image changes back to the blacksmith’s shop.<br />
<br />
“This dagger will do nicely,” Jeff says, a smile on his 2D face, “at least I have something to defend myself and also use as a knife”.<br />
<br />
“You are always welcome to come by and have it upgraded and/or purchase something else,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, but I’d need to earn some cash first,” Jeff says, he looks over at Tyler, “you said you might have a task for me?”<br />
<br />
Tyler nods, “I do, let’s go somewhere where we can discuss more privately,” he says, “you must be hungry from your travel, I know a good tavern with good food. Don’t worry, I’ll pay for our meals”.<br />
<br />
“Gee… thanks, Tyler,” Jeff says, he then turns to Mike, “thanks again,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “any time, Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
When Finn taps his screen he the background changes to the outside and Mike has disappeared, now only Tyler and Jeff can be seen, “follow me to the inn,” the Fox-man says, so Jeff follows Tyler.<br />
<br />
Unaware to Jeff, Tyler is a powerful sorcerer, with powerful hypnotic and transformation powers, ‘meeting Jeff has been the best thing that could have happened,’ the Fox-man thinks to himself, which appears as italic writing on Finn’s screen, ‘I started loosing hope to be able to attend the party since only couples are welcomed. If I could get him to be my companion, then I will be able to do what I came here for, but that would require Jeff to have to become a female’.<br />
<br />
Reading this causes Finn to grin, ‘now… THAT sounds like this story is about to become EXTREMELY interesting,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
When Finn taps his screen the scenery once again changes, now the background shows the inside of what appears to be a tavern or inn: there is a long counter in the back with stools lining the front of it and Finn is able to make out glasses and bottles. Finn taps once again and both Jeff and Tyler mover into frame side by side.<br />
<br />
“This is it,” Tyler says.<br />
<br />
Jeff has a concerned expression on his face, “I hope it’s okay for me to be here,” he says, “I mean… I’m only 16… I’m not familiar with the rules”.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Jeff,” Tyler says, “you’ll be fine, let’s find a quiet area to talk”.<br />
<br />
The two walk through the inn until they find a table in a quiet corner and sit down opposite each other. A waiter approaches the table and hands them a menu, “welcome to the “Silver Sword” Inn,” the lady says, smiling kindly, “is there anything I can bring you two gentlemen?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll have an ale, please,” Tyler says, he then turns to Jeff, “what would you like to drink?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll have a glass of water,” he says, “I’m not really a “liquor” person”.<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the lady says, she then leaves to get the drinks.<br />
<br />
“Now that we are alone,” Tyler says, “I’d like to talk about the task I have for you. There is a party, hosted by lord Brian, which will start in a few hours. I’ve received an invitation, but there is an issue which prevents me from attending the party”.<br />
<br />
“What kind of issue,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“The issue is that only couples are welcome to the party,” Tyler says, “I’ve received the invitation because up until yesterday I was engaged with a female, who suddenly decided to part ways”.<br />
<br />
“Oh… I’m so sorry, Tyler,” Jeff says, “so, how am I supposed to help?”<br />
<br />
“I need to attend the party, not only to be able to see some of my associates, there is something I need to do while I’m there, but that does not have to concern you,” Tyler says, his expression then turning serious, “so, I’m asking you to be my female companion for the evening, that would be your task. You’d do me a huge favor, and I’ll show my gratitude by paying you for it”.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks shocked and surprised, “I… I doubt that I’d be able to convince anyone that I am a female. I mean, my voice is deep and my whole body screams “male”,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tyler grins, “I am a powerful sorcerer,” he whispers, “it will only take a small transformation spell to alter your appearance and clothes. I promise, you’ll be back to being male in the morning”.<br />
<br />
Jeff is to stunned to reply, which appears as “…” in the text box on Finn’s screen.<br />
<br />
“So, how will you decide,” Tyler asks.<br />
<br />
When Finn taps his screen he sees the following options:<br />
<br />
- Accept<br />
- Decline</p>
