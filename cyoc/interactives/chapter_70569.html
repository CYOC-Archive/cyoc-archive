<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner in 30 minutes? How would Ty spend that time? He decided to tour his new home, see what was different. The kitchen was nearby so why not start there?<br />
<br />
Entering the kitchen, Ty was in awe. It seemed that the kitchen was split into two parts. One for the still Human Mark and Ty, while the anthropomorphic June and Dusty had their own section of kitchen to work with. Stove and counters about six feet off the ground with a mammoth fridge. Opening it, Ty smiled when he saw the contents.<br />
<br />
It was filled with fruits, vegetables, nuts and dairy products. Seems like June and Dusty's change made them strict vegetarians. Reaching to open up the smaller fridge, Ty saw his hairier arms and slapped his face.<br />
<br />
<br />
He was still 20! He was experimenting with Dusty earlier and made themselves older! Since June was 33 now, that means she would've had Dusty when she was 13. This would have to change. But for now...<br />
<br />
Looking into the contents of his fridge he saw that Mark had stuffed it with cheap beer. Well, what's the harm in trying one? He guzzled down a can of Guinness and grimaced. Looks like alcohol is an acquired taste. <br />
<br />
Now that Ty has sampled the fruits of adulthood(sex and alcohol) he decided it was time to move onto better things.<br />
<br />
First off, Ty made himself and Dusty 15 again. It felt intoxicating to be a man but Ty didn't want to miss out on school and his milestones. Feeling himself shrink, he felt a tickling sensation as most of the body hair quietly disappeared.<br />
<br />
As soon as his body was back to normal Ty saw Mark enter the kitchen. His face was streaked with oil and sweat. He must of been working on his car. A project that constantly kept him away from his family. Not that the old June or Dusty cared, but now that things were different this would have to change.<br />
<br />
Giving a grunt, Mark gestured Ty aside and took a beer, giving a loud belch after a few greedy gulps.He examined Ty with dark, beady eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Ty, now that you're 15 I think it's time for you to help around the house a little more. Put some hair on that chest of yours.&quot; Ty faked a smile and sarcastically nodded.<br />
<br />
He gave Ty a purposefully rough tap pat on the shoulders and moved towards the living room. June had already left. She was vacuuming upstairs. Throwing his sweaty bulk on the couch he plopped his shoes on the coffee table and turned on the TV. He put it on the sports channel and leaned back in relaxation. Deciding that now was the time to strike, Ty sat beside him on the couch. As soon as he did, Mark turned up the volume on the TV. This game was the only thing that mattered to Mark right now. <br />
<br />
Ty frowned. Mark wasn't cruel or nagging like June. But he was cold and aloof. It seemed to Ty that Mark hated his family and him by extension. He was obsessed with &quot;Manning Up&quot; Ty. He foisted sports memorabilia on Ty and was disappointed in his disinterest. He tried to get Ty into weight lifting and gave him his old set. But Ty wasn't interested in bodybuilding. Whenever Ty tried to grow out his hair even a little, he would get no end of tuts and calm remarks. He repeatedly expressed surprise whenever he saw Ty reading. He said that real men don't think, they act.<br />
<br />
But now all the power was with Ty. Mark had squandered his life and ignored his family. But the new Mark would be a proud family man and a pillar of the community. It was time to start his transformation.<br />
<br />
Ty made it so that no one would enter the living room until the transformation was over. And he also decided to keep Mark awake, but unaware.<br />
<br />
First off was the regression. Mark was past his prime and would need to keep up with June. So Mark grew younger until he was 33. His body rippled as his paunch melted into toned abs. Wrinkles disappeared and his thin, balding hair became a thick tousled mop. The grey in his hair gave way to a vengeful surge of black. His face glowed with new-found youth and his clothes now hung loosely on him. Mark used to be a powerful man. But like so many young athletes they let go of their bodies as they grew middle-aged. But now Mark was back in his glory days.<br />
<br />
Mark leaned forward out his comfortable position. The aches in his body were gone and he was full of energy. He couldn't wait to talk to his pals at the bar about the big championship game!<br />
<br />
Ty regarded Mark like an artist gazing at canvas.He was planning his future changes to Mark. But Ty felt more like a poet. He felt a beauty and grace in the changes he made. Mark was going to follow June and Dusty as a giraffe man. This was a given. But how would the new Mark be? Would his likes and dislikes be? Ty spent a few moments pondering this before moving on to the rest of his work.<br />
<br />
Pale yellow hairs began poking through Mark's skin. This new fur was noticeable lighter than either June or Dusty's. Mark began stroking himself thoughtlessly. The fur grew incredibly thick until it reached a length of four inches. Light orange splotches marked his hide as giraffe. And this coat of fur was every bit as soft, thick, and enticing as June's. Mark threw all of his clothes on the ground. Why was he wearing those?<br />
<br />
Loud cracking noises accompanied the next change as Mark's body structure changed. His feet became semi-cloven along with his hands. He began to grow in height until he was eight and a half feet tall. His neck grew as well, becoming two feet long.Mark would be noticeably shorter than June. A dainty tail of two feet sprouted from above his rear, adorned with a tuft of pale orange fur. His still human penis grew back it's foreskin lost long ago and withdrew into a sheath. Thick fur covered up this indecency. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the proud muscles on Mark's frame began to wither away. His body frame was becoming lithe and his demeanor serene. Ty had resolved that the new Mark was going to be more than some mindless jock.<br />
<br />
Now that the body was done, it was time to move onto the face. Ty willed Mark's face to push into a snout. He knew that his tongue was going to be a dark blue just like June's. Ty decided to make Mark's eyes green to match June's. It would a cute match. Little horns grew on Mark's head, just like on any giraffe. A few touch-ups made sure he had the right amount of fur on his face. Now it was time to move on the hair. Mark had always disdained long hair, so why not give him some? His hair became a pale orange and became even thicker. As it crept down his neck and past his shoulders it finally stopped in-between his shoulder-blades. As a personal touch Ty made his hair luxuriously curly, a real pleasure to run the hands through. His curly tresses lent him a gentle, innocent look.<br />
<br />
Now it was time for the mental changes. He made Mark smarter. Much smarter. And a lover of culture and education. Thick books began adorning the walls in the living room. A few tasteful pieces of art began showing up on the walls. Mark looked surprised for a moment, but than hastily shut off the TV and scooped up a book of classical history on the coffee table. He began eagerly reading the tome, enraptured by it's contents. As a little touch Ty willed a pair of Pince-nez glasses on his snout. It gave Mark an affable, genteel look.<br />
<br />
Ty began working on other parts of Mark's personality. He was now the perfect husband and father. His greatest joys in life were his family and than his books. He was a teetotaler and didn't smoke. Ty dropped his libido down. Mark enjoyed love and romance over petty carnal desires. Mark was now a Doctor and prestigious lecturer. The world shuddered a bit as Ty's home became more opulent. <br />
<br />
Ty looked over his new foster-father. An exotic combination of man and giraffe. He was weaker and shorter than June and had a gentle,innocent look about him. His eyes were clever and focused on the book in front of him. Ty noticed that the title was in Latin.<br />
<br />
Changes finished Mark smiled at Ty. &quot;Hey Ty, did you know that in ancient Rome that the tail of a sting-ray was considered to be a cure for tooth-ache? What a remarkable culture.&quot; Ty could only nod, entranced by his new creation.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, a loud clopping noise upstairs broke the silence. June was quickly going downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, spending some time with Mark? How thoughtful of you Ty! I'll have dinner ready for my two men in a jiffy, I just need to get the salad out of the fridge.&quot;June then vanished into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, lets not keep the Mrs waiting, eh Ty? Get washed up go get your sister so we can have dinner.&quot; Mark left the room in long, graceful strides.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled. This new family was great. Now how would dinner be like? Ty went to the downstairs bathroom and washed his hands as he wondered what to do next.</p>
