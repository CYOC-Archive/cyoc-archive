<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt realized he would have to live as a girl for now, as on the program it was said to be the only model of him created. To be more exact, he made a disastrous mistake that overwrote his old files. On that given note, he changed from a guy into a girl overnight. He felt more comfortable with this knowledge, and felt excited about how useful this program could be, even though it changed him into who he was now. But he had to do some things to fix his life&#39;s glitches. A program always has problems after all. He looked around in the program, finding a place where he could note his changes, and found a log file inside the databank of the 3D-model. On the log file stood a detailed summary of what changes he&#39;d made to the woman on the screen. Clicking on another folder he was able to keep notes on what he changed.<br />
<br />
What he was about to do, felt like a life changing risk to him. Matt had already found out that this program could alter reality if it wanted to, as right now he wasn&#39;t in any way related to his old family anymore. Actually, he wasn&#39;t related to anyone on earth, according to the program. With the option to alter reality around him, he could change the awareness of people, but also of himself. What he wanted to do, was change his name. It wasn&#39;t a crazy change. He just wanted to swap his first name with his surname. However, he didn&#39;t want to have the risk of people thinking he was called Matt. As he was used to call himself that, he could easily blurt that out in public without even realizing he did so. Thus, he made the decision. Matt Helen would from now on be called, Helen Matt. It was as easy as one, two, three. He wanted to keep this as an important note though. He added it into his notes, and closed the log file.<br />
<br />
Matt looked at the databank again. The databank showed all information that was already added, for example his height and weight. Underneath it there were things that needed to still be filled in, like his age and, more importantly, his new name. Matt took a deep breath, his enlarged chest rising in the process. He changed his name from &quot;Matt Helen&quot; to &quot;Helen Matt&quot; and searched for the &quot;alternate reality&quot; option afterwards.<br />
<br />
He found this option in the &quot;unrelated settings&quot; folder. The unrelated settings meant that they didn&#39;t have any effect on the changes on the 3D-model you made. Matt shuddered at what he was about to do, but he went for it. He clicked on &quot;alternate reality&quot;, and saw to options after that. He could select if he wanted to alter reality for others or for himself. He thought about it for a bit and went for it. Matt selected them both, closed the folder and brought his mouse towards the floppy disk, the icon of saving. He closed his eyes waiting for an impact, as he clicked down his left mouse button one last time.<br />
<br />
The impact never came though. Her eyes opened again, and a careful smile appeared on her face as she found out there were no physical consequences. &quot;My name is Helen&quot;, she then said to herself, in a for her still unfamiliar voice. She&#39;d have to get used to it though. She brought her arms up and stretched inside her chair from relief. But still the thought of her being a girl bugged her. It fit with her name though, she&#39;d always been called Helen before. But wait a minute...<br />
<br />
Helen opened the &quot;log files&quot; folder and clicked on an option so she could see the notes she selected. It was just as she thought. She remembered typing this in before she made the crucial decision to change her name. Memories of the past however told her she was always could Helen, since her youth. It was somewhat a paradox seeing this note. &quot;Name change from Matt Helen to Helen Matt&quot;, it said. She remembered it though, and repressed the thoughts of her so called &quot;real&quot; memories. It was all so she wouldn&#39;t make mistakes in public, by calling herself Matt all of a sudden. Nevertheless, she felt really uncomfortable to choose the option changing her name back to Matt again. It felt somewhat unnatural, according to her &quot;memories&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow&quot;, Helen said with a sigh. &quot;This program can do anything&quot;, she said, bringing her hands underneath her shirt. She brought her hands up and started massaging them, her breasts, which she created on the 3D-model. This program was addicting, and arousal was building up, only by the thought of how this program could alter everything that exists on earth. Helen&#39;s question wasn&#39;t what she could change, but what she would change...</p>
