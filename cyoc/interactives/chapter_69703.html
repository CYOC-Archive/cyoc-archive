<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen looked up at her mom with a pitiful expression. Briefly debating whether to tell her mom what had <br />
happened, but ruling it out just as quickly, she decided to risk the fight that her mom would probably start. <br />
The thought of going to school like this brought on a feeling of rising terror in the pit of Jen's stomach.<br />
<br />
It would't be hard to fake being sick, because, honestly, she already felt disoriented with the onset of mild <br />
shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel good, mom,&quot; Jennifer whined.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, her mom's reaction was gentle and concerned, not the usual suspicion or automatic argument that <br />
usually came with any assertion that she was too sick for school. The keys dangling from her mom's hand and a <br />
glance at the clock made Jen realize that her mom was running behind, which probably helped. Her mom was <br />
usually more permissive when feeling guilty about something already.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look white as a sheet, dear,&quot; her mom said. &quot;I thought something was wrong when I found you sitting on <br />
the floor looking like the cat dragged you in here, but you should probably stay home if you're not feeling <br />
well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom put a hand on her forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you might have a fever, but I can't really tell,&quot; she continued. &quot;Still, I think you'd better lay down <br />
and get some rest. I'll call the school, but I've got to get to work. You're old enough to fend for yourself <br />
but if you get worse or you need anything, call me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen's mother ushered her from the floor and back into bed. Greatly relieved that a confrontation with mom was <br />
not in the cards this morning, Jen slid back into the covers as her mom kissed her forehead, then left the <br />
room.<br />
<br />
Jen felt much safer, however, once she heard the sound of her mom's car starting in the driveway, backing up, <br />
then accelerating away from the house.<br />
<br />
For several minutes, Jen lay in bed, wishing that it would all go away. But the heavy feeling of her huge new <br />
breasts weighing her chest down persisted, impossible to ignore. It was clear the curse had really happened, <br />
and was not going away at all.<br />
<br />
As she concentrated, she noticed that weight on her chest seemed different, even since the change. Her boobs <br />
seemed heavier.<br />
<br />
She reached a hand under her sweatshirt and felt the still-unfamiliar and overly-large mass of breast. She <br />
found her new additions were not just heavier, but also less springy, and a lot more sensitive than she was <br />
used to. A few probes with her fingers told her they were filling up with a liquid -- and quickly.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered the details of Kyle's curse. Her body was storing up sperm in her breasts. Her eyes <br />
widened.<br />
<br />
However, her cum-filled tits and the new phalus in her mouth were already delivering hormones into her system, <br />
bringing on feelings any teen-aged boy would know well. She was getting horny, and not in the gentle, yet <br />
aching way that she was used to. It was an urgent kind of feeling, and focused very specifically in her <br />
changed parts.<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes, her hand still touching her breasts absently. Though her breasts were still swelling, and <br />
not entirely comfortable, her fingertips found a response from them that made her tingle. The feeling spread <br />
from her chest, up through her throat and, distinctly, within her cock-tongue. Her pussy started to dampen as <br />
well; her other hand found its way over her mound, touching herself through the cotton of her panties.<br />
<br />
With her mouth closed, she started sucking experimentally. Her cock responded and began to harden, and for a <br />
short while it felt quite delicious in every sense. Then she felt her jaw being forced apart as her member <br />
pushed its way towards her lips. She relaxed to allow it. <br />
<br />
The erection grew slowly, and she found it felt very, very good to keep her lips pressed around the <br />
circumference of it as the head, then shaft, crept beyond her mouth inch by inch. <br />
<br />
Soon, looking downwards, she could see the tip as her cock grew ever longer and thicker in girth. The veiny <br />
skin retracted to reveal the mushroom-like head as it enlarged.<br />
<br />
The fingers of her hands grew busier, circling her nipples and clit with increasing vigor as she watched the <br />
new appendage growing. She took her hand off her breast and out of her sweater. She touched the cock gingerly, <br />
making it twitch visibly and harden faster.<br />
<br />
Jen enclosed the shaft in her hands. She'd once given a hand job to an old boyfriend in a movie theater, under <br />
his coat in the dark. But she'd had very little time to explore then since his unzipped pants weren't quite <br />
lose enough, and he'd chickened out quickly. Of course, she hadn't been touching *herself* then, either, and <br />
Jen found this was something quite nice indeed.<br />
<br />
Its surface was soft, not entirely different from the way her labia felt under her fingers, but a squeeze <br />
found a stiff inner core around which the outer skin of the thing slipped back and forth easily. She twisted <br />
the pliable skin gently and pumped her hand along the shaft, and it made sparkles in her nerves. The cock <br />
surged, pushing the final several inches upwards into a full erection as the head became completely visible.<br />
<br />
A trail of clear pre-cum dribbled from the tip, running down the shaft toward Jen's hand as she pumped herself <br />
along the twelve inches of dick sticking out of her mouth. The lubrication enhanced the sensation, and her <br />
throat flexed automatically with unfamiliar sexual muscles. <br />
<br />
She felt flush, with an urge for release like she'd never felt before, all through her neck and breasts. Her <br />
clit was harder than it had ever been and her panties were soaked with her juices. Sweat dappled her forehead, <br />
breasts and abdomen.<br />
<br />
Hastily stripping her clothes off, she lay back down on her bed covers and watched herself in the vanity <br />
mirror, which gave her a mostly complete view of her torso. <br />
<br />
She watched herself grip her tongue-cock as she stroked it, saw her huge, full tits draped over her chest and <br />
belly, and saw her other hand strumming her clit and pussy. It was obscene, but also the most freakishly <br />
arousing thing she'd ever laid eyes on. <br />
<br />
She looked herself in the eyes as she masturbated with increasing intensity. Her changes broke the familiarity <br />
of her reflection; cock-tongue Jen was a twisted, peep-show version of herself that made looking in the mirror <br />
just like watching someone else. The size of the cock that mirror-Jen stroked furiously was absurdly large, <br />
especially so stemming from her cute girly lips, and her breasts made her body a caricature of fertility. Jen <br />
felt aversion, and yet she was inescapably turned on.<br />
<br />
Without warning, she felt the orgasm crest and break across her body. Her pussy flooded and slickened the <br />
sides of her thighs. Her breasts convulsed as new muscles inside her pumped forcefully, and a blinding wave of <br />
pleasure, the most intense she'd ever experienced, rose up from her torso as her cock surged in her hand. <br />
<br />
A rapid series of pumps, each accompanied by another wave of feeling, forced the cum from the tip of Jen's <br />
cock. The first small burst threw itself in a little curl from the head and splashed warmly across her hand <br />
with an audible splurt. But the next, and each gout afterward, shot up into the air, and it was all Jen could <br />
do to keep the stream from coating her bedroom ceiling and furnishings, deciding instead to try to have the <br />
liquid splash across her skin.<br />
<br />
And splash it did. There was a lot of it, and it kept coming out. She nearly blacked out from the intensity of <br />
the climax.<br />
<br />
As the sensation faded, the cock softened and shrank back into Jen's mouth, the foreskin wrapping the head <br />
neatly back into the spot her normal tongue had been just over an hour earlier.<br />
<br />
As her senses returned from orbit, Jen realized that much of her was covered in cum, her jelly-esque seed <br />
cooling down from body temperature now that it was outside her. She could feel it on her cheeks and chin, all <br />
over her torso, and even down her legs and across the tops of her feet. There were trails of it on the carpet, <br />
and all across her bed. That she'd come all over herself was a realization that revolted her a little but, <br />
unexpectedly, turned her on a great deal and left behind a residual arousal.<br />
<br />
Still, she knew she'd need to clean up the mess before it soaked in. She grabbed a couple of towels from the <br />
closet, and set to work. A few minutes later, the machines in the laundry room and streams of hot water from <br />
her shower were working on removing any trace evidence of her first penile orgasm.<br />
<br />
As the water ran down her body, washing away the cum from her skin, Jen...</p>
