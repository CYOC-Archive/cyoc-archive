<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you come to the apartment door that You unlock the door and come inside, but you could hear the tv playing loudly while seeing a large figure sitting on the couch watching it. You rub your eyes in disbelief as It hears you entering the apartment room and turns around that staring back at you isn&#39;t the Jack you knew, but an anthro grey wolf. He just blinks at you for a second and goes back to his show as he always been into furry stuff that he would sometimes go into places with furries would go to, even watch furry tv/movie shows. Jack would also go to the zoo and visit the animals, but with him in the swim team that he sometimes doesn&#39;t have time for furry thing as he would go to art class and draw furry things. the human Jack you knew was gone that thanks to the wish you made, he was now a furry grey wolf as he looks somewhat like the big bad wolf.<br />
<br />
his nose and jaw have been pushed out from his face to form a snout as his eyes stayed the same blue color, but slightly darker. His ears are much more pointier then usual as his nose is now black, leathery, and wet that you soon approach him and glance over at the tv as he was watching what appears to be a 1973 Disney anime clasic, robin hood. When you walk around the couch, your eyes widen as Jack stares back at you once more like he doesn&#39;t understand your shocked expression. His shorts are nowhere to be seen let alone his t-shirt as he was wearing his school uniform. his school uniform was mostly tight on him as it was a one-piece swimsuit with a japanese text of his name on it that his tight, yet shiny skintight bodysuit of his swim uniform was also showing off his tight abs, his pecs, muscular body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up with you? You look like you just ran into a ghost or something like that!&quot; Jack said while standing up off the couch that it snaps you out of your daze, but you both blush for a moment when you saw his erection bulge throw his swimwear. seeing his balls and dick the way you did made him turn his head slightly as you also noticed his white hair reaches down below his hip line that even his tail was white as it to ran long, as long as his hair while looking at his bicep arms with two separate sets of armbands. he was blushing so red that you could almost see a sweatdrop running down his face. <br />
<br />
embarrassed, his sat back down as he was a bit shy about you seeing his groin area, but you notice quite a few things happen to your roommate. you open your mouth to tell Jack something about him, but then you stop yourself. Whether it was the genie&#39;s magic or some sick curiosity inside you that quietly allow your new wolf friend to continue to watch the tv show while deciding it&#39;s probably ok to come in. You wander across your surprisingly bedroom as your roommate&#39;s clothing have gone through some changes as well that even his under garments had a small hole for his tail. As he laughs at the show on TV that you could hear him from the other room as you decided to watch the show with him. making your way to the couch Jack is sitting on, Jack is unknowingly lets out an animalistic grunt as he shifts around on the couch for you to sit on.<br />
<br />
when the show was over is when he flipped through the channels to another furry show that this time, it was kung fu panda 2 that he then moves forward just enough to still be sitting on the couch as you sit there examining him while he ignores you. You turn your attention to the show as the two of you just sit there quietly while watching that his tail flicks about as it sits above his butt. As you were sitting there while trying to process everything that as the TV show takes a commercial break is when Jack lets out a long, satisfied sigh and gets up to use the bathroom while you didn&#39;t  feel motivated to leave the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HELL!&quot; Jack said out loud that it Soon happened. realizing he was looking at his reflection from the bathroom is when he soon exited out of there in a rush that he paused in front of the couch with anger and shock while looking at you speechless as he then looked upon himself on what he is. gesturing towards the tiny space between what&#39;s left of the two of you that he then asked with fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;what the hell happened to me? i&#39;m like a sexy, hairy beast!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;more like the big bad wolf Jack.&quot; you said as the commercial break was done and the show started up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;what ever, just tell me what happened!&quot;</p>
