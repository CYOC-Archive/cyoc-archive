<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well while the werewolves had been cruisin up and down Main St<br />
with their Harleys and howling at the moon Carrie had a sexual<br />
awakening.She had always been a tomboy and now she suddenly felt<br />
this knowledge that she was really a boy in a girls body.She couldn't <br />
explain her new gender identity to her dad and Judy had gone missing.<br />
Thus when Judy's teenage son Josh showed up looking for his mom she <br />
was surprised when he looked enviously at Carrie and told her that<br />
he felt he was a woman trapped in a boys body.Ohhhh?Carrie asked<br />
him a few more questions and out came Judys past.She had been <br />
a happily married housewife who had two kids,Josh and a 10 year old<br />
daughter named Christina.One night Judy had come home to find her<br />
husband in bed with his bosses wife,and Judy lost it.She took to <br />
wearing wild sexy clothing,died her hair pink and became a bad girl.<br />
Judy Cleaver was dead,long live Judy Lizzard.It didn't take long<br />
for her to get arrested for soliciting and after the divorce her<br />
exhusband got the kids,the house and Fluffy the cat.Josh had lost <br />
track of his mom over the last 4 years and Cristina wanted nothing <br />
more to do with her wild and crazy mom.It was all psychological.Judy <br />
hated Carrie cuz she reminded her of her lost daughter.Then the werewolf bikers roared into town and seized control and the bracelet.<br />
Well Carrie had managed to save two charms,that pen charm and one of<br />
a dinosaur.As soon as she saw Judy in the public square Carrie knew something had changed since the old Judy hadn't been so tall.Carrie held the pen charm and wished for Judy to return to the way she used to be before she'd used the pen charm on her.Judy suddenly felt her <br />
powers and her body diminishing,and felt the munchkins vanish as if<br />
they had never been.Judy was once again a mortal human in oversized <br />
clothing,which meant the Brimstone Dragon would not be around<br />
to protect them should the werewolves make a move on the town.She<br />
also now had to face the reality of mortal problems such as broken<br />
marriages,lost daughters who reject a loving mother,stepdaughters<br />
who reminded her of past misdeeds,etc.Judy screeched and collapsed to the ground sobbing.That was all fine and good but off in the distance<br />
thousands of headlights lit up the night as the werewolf leader called<br />
for reinforcements.All the townsfolk fled into Smitherville Heights<br />
Mall and prepared for the end.While most folk went to the bar and got <br />
royally drunk Carrie,Norman,Judy and Josh had a heart to heart family<br />
discussion where they settled their issues.Whilst the band played <br />
Nearer My God To Thee and the reverend was hearing confessions,Mr <br />
Greene and the sheriff were telling the boys how to use a gun and were<br />
melting down silver jewelry to make silver bullets.Not that it would have mattered as they could hear shrieks and roars in the surrounding <br />
hills from gigantic savage beasts created by the werewolf leader<br />
with the charm bracelet .The Army of Darkness was arising and Smitherville Heights was just the beginning.Well Carrie tried that dinosaur and pen bracelet on herself and her family but nothing <br />
happenned.The charm had the program but lacked a power plant.It seemed Judy had still possessed some residual energy from her initial <br />
change into a pen.Well they were all going to die so they strolled down the darkened aisles of the local Save-Mart.When they came to the <br />
childrens book section they came across a cheap book titled Bertha and<br />
Bert,which was a colouring book about a newly discovered species of <br />
dinosaur named Brachiosaurus rex or King Arm Lizard.When they all looked excitedly at the figures-largest land animal ever,40 meters long,average weight 80 tons,25 feet at the shoulders,13 meter tail,13 meter neck and a head which could survey the world froma height of<br />
55 feet,they all discovered they were all dinosaur enthusiasts.Ahhh<br />
but for that missing bracelet .They also discovered that Josh wanted <br />
to be Bertha and Carrie wanted to be Bert.Norman and Judy on the other hand were quite happy with their genders.They moved on and came <br />
across the jewelry section.Now the fiqurine know as the Warrior of <br />
Brimstone Mountain meant nothing to the others,except that is was rather expensive at $5000,even if it was the only one of its kind in existence.Judy however knew different as it contained ink from her original pen body.It was a magical nulear power plant nestled with <br />
worthless figures of Mickey Mouse and Goofy.Judy got to work.She smashed the case,grabbed that fiqurine and looked at it's base where was written Dracyn Workshops,Seahouses England.It was an original and <br />
she told the others to stop looking at her like that and get to work.She ponded the fiqurine into a powder,added water and told the others to smear it on their skins.As the paste touched her skin Carrie could feel it sizzle and bubble as the magical energy seeped into her.Then she took another look at that book on Bertha and Bert.<br />
<br />
High Noon<br />
<br />
If it was bad during the night it was far worse come morning.The werewolf bikers had surrounded the mall and all sorts of furry scaled horrors had joined the ranks of the Army of Darkness.As Mr Greene and the sheriff stepped onto the dusty street to face off against the bad guys they wondered where everyone else had gone.It seemed like everyone else was in the bar and would come in 5 minutes.Mr Greene was a High Noon fan and had taken a sheriffs outfit out of the costume rack.The two men put on their cowboy hats,pulled up their boots and strapped on their gunbelts.They walked down Smithervilles Main St and stopped in front of the Dracyn Workshop factory.It was a messy place and had lots of hideyholes and planters to littered about.The werewolf leader stepped forward and said &quot;G'Day Jeb and<br />
Ted.&quot;He puffed on his cigarette and showed his luger.Behind him you could hear the soft rumble of a thousand bikes.The sheriff spoke up<br />
&quot;we're given you and your boys five minutes to get out of Smitherville&quot;<br />
There were howls and yelps of laughter from the boys and the werewolf leader barked sharply to his men to shut up.He puffed his cigarette and slowly drawled&quot;you and who else?&quot;Mr Greene and the sheriff choked nervously as they tried to think of a reply.Then the earth shook and <br />
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM echoed from behind them.They turned and saw 4 100 ton brachiosaurus rex's swaying and weaving as they thundered up the street towards them.They were SLOWW and were jugging along at little better then a jog.But they were there and the sheriff turned back to the werewolf and said hopefully &quot;Us and THEM?&quot;</p>
