<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ernest waited anxiously in the lobby of doctor Veritas&#39;s office. He couldn&#39;t quite remember why he was here last time (His memory seemed to be failing with old age) but he did remember feeling much better after a session. Oh well whatever reason he was here for before couldn&#39;t be nearly as embarrassing as the reason he was here now.<br />
<br />
The door to the doctors office opened and a bulky man stumbled through, looking spaced out with a big grin on his face. Ernest hoped the good doctor would make him feel as good as this guy.<br />
<br />
After Ernest was called in, he and the doctor exchanged pleasantries before they got down to the matter at hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why have you come to see me today Ernest?&quot; doctor Veritas asked.<br />
<br />
Ernest took a breath, here goes nothing. &quot;Well you see doc about a few weeks ago I bought this cream that was supposed to enlarge my penis. Cost me about $200 and it ended up giving me a nasty rash-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me stop you there,&quot; Doctor Veritas interrupted &quot;I am a psychological therapist, this sounds like a problem you should talk about with your GP or a dermatologist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no, I went to my GP and he prescribed me a topical antibiotic, cleared it right up. But I got a stern lecture to go with it. Said I should talk to a shrink about my penis size insecurities...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah so we are here to discuss your feelings of sexual inadequacy.&quot; the doctor nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn&#39;t think it was necessary&quot; Ernest blushed, &quot;But he insisted. Said he was sick of me coming in botched penis enlargement accidents-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t the first penis enlargement scam you&#39;ve fallen for?&quot; The doctor asked scribbling in his notebook.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ads say they&#39;re guaranteed to work!&quot; Ernest whined &quot;I&#39;ve tried pumps, stretchers, jelqing, and pills as well. Maybe I&#39;m just not using them right...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay I get the picture&quot; the doctor interrupted again &quot;Well lets see what we&#39;re working with, please remove your pants and underwear Ernest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh&quot; Ernest blushed a deep red and squirmed in his seat. &quot;Do I really have to doc?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to need to see the extent of this issue if we&#39;re going to get to the bottom of this. Now strip&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you think it&#39;s necessary...&quot; Ernest&#39;s shyness about his body was overtaken by his agreeable nature. Doctor Veritas hadn&#39;t even have to used his powers yet.<br />
<br />
He carefully pulled down his khakis and white briefs, trying not to strain his back. Then he lifted his sweater and shirt up, revealing his mound of pubic fat. Under the thick bush of grey pubic hairs there was an indentation in the fat pad where his tiny penis was hiding.<br />
<br />
The doctor leaned in for a closer look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm yes, very small indeed. Definitely classified as a micropenis. I can barely see the tip peeking out.&quot; he opened up one of his desk drawers and brought out a wooden ruler. &quot;Now to make an accurate assessment I&#39;m going to need to take a measurement. Can you make it erect?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ernest continued to blush deeper and deeper red. &quot;Oh heavens no doctor, I can&#39;t remember the last time I was...um...aroused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well please try your best.&quot; Doctor Veritas instructed.<br />
<br />
Ernest could only nod, and reached of his hands down and began gently stroking his soft dicklet between his thumb and index finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I can definitely see why you&#39;d be desperate enough to waste money on all these untested male enhancement remedies.&quot; Doctor Veritas commented as Ernest desperately tried to obtain an erection &quot;But there&#39;s something you need to realize...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that doc?&quot; Ernest prepared himself for the usual platitudes he had heard all his life about how size doesn&#39;t matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want a bigger penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ernest had been expecting to hear that. What the doctor had just said didn&#39;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Of course I want a bigger penis! I see all the other men in the locker room at the gym walking around with their huge dicks swinging about and I wish mine was as big as theirs!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you definitely admire larger penises.&quot; Doctor Veritas nodded knowingly, &quot;But if yours wasn&#39;t so small you wouldn&#39;t be able to indulge in your small penis humiliation fetish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Small penis humiliation?&quot; Ernest had no idea what that was but it sounded positively indecent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Small penis humiliation or &#39;SPH&#39; is an embarrassing little fetish where a male is sexually aroused by showing off his pathetic little dick and having people laugh and insult it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I would hate other people knowing I have a tiny wee-wee!&quot; Ernest was confused. Why did he just say that. Ernest never calls his penis a wee-wee. Except that time in the changing rooms at his old football club. They were giving him a hard time about having the smallest dick on the team and wouldn&#39;t give him back his clothes until he said he had a tiny wee-wee out loud. Something about the memory made him feel a strange tingle of pleasure. Wait that never happened? Did it? &quot;No! I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying doctor. I don&#39;t like having my wee-w... I mean genitals exposed. It&#39;s so vulgar. I can&#39;t have one of those small penis humiliation whats-its.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but you definitely do have an SPH fetish,&quot; the doctor refuted &quot;even if decades of chronic masturbation stops your little dick from maintaining an erection, the thought of having your tiny dick humiliated continues to be the only thing that excites you sexually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ernest had subconsciously started rubbing his flaccid micropenis more vigorously getting more excited at the thought of having his little dicklet exposed. How had the doctor figured out his shameful little secret? Every night searching for more and more SPH porn and rubbing his little dick raw imagining himself as the target of all that ridicule. Masturbating for hours on end, tiring himself out before he was able to cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact...&quot; the doctor continued &quot;The only way you can cum any more is by having a first hand SPH experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I&#39;m not some kind of sexual deviant!&quot; Ernest cried as he tried to deny all the memories of loitering around changing rooms, hoping for a reaction. Countless nights spent on internet chat rooms exposing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just being here now, exposing your pathetic little dick to me is bringing you close to an orgasm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man&#39;s breathing became laboured as he felt pressure building in his saggy balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now your little dicklet is going to pump out the best little load it can. After that you&#39;ll be nothing but a perverted, tiny dicked exhibitionist with a SPH fetish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Ernest tried to resist as best he could, but hadn&#39;t ejaculated in so long. And it felt so good. The semen felt like it was crawling its way right to the tip of his tiny dick. He couldn&#39;t hold it anymore. Ernest released an undignified perverted moan of relief and shame. His soft micropenis finally became firm for the briefest of moments and dribled out an ooze of cum before withrawing back into the elderly man&#39;s fat folds. While the volume and ejection were pitiful, the pleasure was so powerful Ernest immediately passed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ervin! Wake up!&quot; Doctor Veritas snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
The old man&#39;s eyes flew open and he looked around confused. Gone was Ernest the kindly modest old man, and in his place was Ervin the pervert.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry! I don&#39;t know-&quot; Ervin looked down and saw his fingers pinching his sticky weewee. Had he just masturbated right in front of this man? He didn&#39;t remember it but it certainly sounds like something he&#39;d do. He definitely felt the familiar rush of adrenaline that only came from his exhibitionist activities.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing&quot; Doctor Vertias yelled at him &quot;You can&#39;t just whip out your micropenis and masturbate in my office!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I...&quot; Ervin was at a loss for words, the doctor was likely loud enough for everyone in the building to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put your disgusting little genitals away and get out of here you dispicable perverted old man!&quot; Doctor Veritas shouted as he pushed open the door, exposing him to everyone in the waiting room &quot;You&#39;ll be lucky if I don&#39;t call the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Please I&#39;m going!&quot; He pulled up his shorts that were two sizes too tight, leaving nothing to the imagination. Then he wrapped his trench coat back over his oversized belly and rushed out of the office still confused, ashamed and excited over what had just happened. With each step he could feel fresh semen squishing against the tight fabric around his pubic region. His heart pounded from the judgemental eyes snickers in the waiting room as he ran past. He couldn&#39;t wait to get home and spend hours pulling on his little worm, thinking about this moment.<br />
<br />
Doctor Veritas crossed Ervin off his list, satisfied with a job well done. The man definitely wouldn&#39;t have any more small penis insecurity issues.</p>
