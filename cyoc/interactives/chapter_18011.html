<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Barkeep slides the frothing mug of MuleHead Beer down the length of the glassy bar. <br />
<br />
Paul grabs it with one hand in a manner he's long used and learned so very well. A look at the deep reddish brown color and its foaming head of what should be white froth, but is not as pure as he might think.<br />
<br />
Lifting the glass to his lips the scent of the beer touches his nose first. Rank smelling like some past memory of a stallion barn floor, one coated in urine and smeared with the droppings of horses upset with anguish.<br />
<br />
The beer rolls out over the glass mug's rounded brim. Into his open mouth it pours and with a hard swallow he downs two mighty gulps.<br />
<br />
Instantly his eyes go wide open as the poisoned beer tainted with special enhancement properties begins a life changing sensation.<br />
<br />
Slamming the mug to the bar Paul looks at the Barkeeper, the man smiles back at him with a look of jeering maniacal glee.<br />
<br />
Slowly Paul slides off the barstool and with a guiding hand running along the bar he walks to confront this evil man.<br />
<br />
&quot;That beer, you poisoned me!&quot; said Paul slowly but with obvious disgust.<br />
<br />
The man looks at Paul, &quot;You ain't over fifty are you buddy?&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Paul on his adventure returns the answer quickly. &quot;Fifty five yesterday, and your damn beer tasted like horse urine!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Barkeep smiles wider yet, &quot;Not horse urine but mule urine, its the base we use to make some idiots like you into sterile Jacks with big dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul feels a wave of pain flodding in all directions from his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Buddy you had better find a seat! If you are that old the beer has stranger effects and being too old for normal transformation, I suspect you will mutate in odd ways.&quot; says the Barkeeper to Paul.<br />
<br />
Paul wanted to say more of what he had on his mind but at the moment he felt the Barkeeper was quite right. <br />
<br />
Staggering past those still entering the bar, Paul works his way from chair to chair until he flops into a booth nearest the front door. He sits up as his guts grumble from the rank beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you Mister?&quot; says a sweet sounding voice from behind his left shoulder.<br />
<br />
As Paul turns to loo the figure of a slender female waitress comes into his line of sight. She has real facial beauty but as his eyes pan down her form he gasps at what he sees.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God, what are you?' Paul exclaims.<br />
<br />
A giggle from the girl and she stepps very close to Paul's face. Her face is quite human but from there down her form thought human in structure is coated in deep reddish brown mahgony colored hair. A coating of shiny fuzzy hairs covering her hands both palm and backs, she stands before him hairy and naked, her hairy coat the only thing from saying she was naked.<br />
<br />
Paul's half hunched over the table of his booth he is inches from the girl's fuzzy covered crotch. The scent of her sex prevails all other smells as she stands herself tight to his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a beer or a friendly lick?&quot; says the girl as she giggles once more.<br />
<br />
For as sick as Paul feels right then there is some crazy urge to stick his face into her hairy fuzzy groin and take a rich draft of her very female scent. As his haed moves that last inch to press the tip of his nose into her lips of sweet pleasures she places her hands to the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Jamming Paul's head forward the man is taken by surprise and finds his nose parting her sexual gates to Hell. <br />
<br />
Eyes explode wider than ever as they are press with his face into her furry tummy. The girl massages Paul's head around grinding his nose and lips into her groin. <br />
<br />
Nose is wet, as his face is jammed into her crotch only the sensations of her moist reaction is he able to feel. Unable to speak out with his face pressed into her sensual most flesh Paul is stunned for a moment.<br />
<br />
The feel to his lips of her sexual lips and the moistness of her vaginal juices smearing his nose and lips, he licks his lips taking into his mouth her infecting juices.<br />
<br />
Hearing her silly giggle as she releases her grip on Paul's head, he pulls back but not before having the queerest thing occure. As his head moves away from her crotch his tongue juts out and slides between her lips of female pleasure. <br />
<br />
Pressing in between them they are parting and allowing a small flood of her juices to exit. The juices coat Paul's tongue and bring him a odd sense of duty to her.<br />
<br />
Sitting back and looking up into her face his expression is one of wonderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mister if you could see your face right now!&quot; exclaims the waitress.<br />
<br />
Paul would have but his lips felt thicker as his tongue seemed to fill his entire mouth. <br />
<br />
A shake of his head had him sensing the weakness of his neck or the increased weight of his skull. One seeking searching hand touched his face.<br />
<br />
An index finger rings the enlarged nostril of his now Mule like nose. It traces the muzzle and lips feeling the long feeler whiskers which now prevail his shaved face.<br />
<br />
His touching of the face with both hands begins as he notes the growth of hairs all over his head. It is as his hands touch the top of his head discovering tall furry ears sprouting from the sides of his strange half human shaped head. They finger the beginning of his mane as the coarse stubble is just now sprouting upward.<br />
<br />
The sensing of his changes he looks up at her round and pretty face. A question is poised in his mouth but try as he did the only sound he could make was that of a ragged gruff bray.<br />
<br />
The girl smiles and raising her hand above her head she snaps her fingers loudly.<br />
<br />
In the second her snapping fingers make the sound Paul feels the booth begin to move. It turns on a dime rotating him along with it into another room all darkened and chilly cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty five years old, damn it man didn't you know that this island is for the young! Your age is against you, you realize. The donkey brew is mixing with that unrefined Mule Head Beer and should give you a real thrill or two.&quot; says a young man's clear voice from out in the blackness.<br />
<br />
Paul tries to answer, but blasting forth his ragged brays he clamps a hand to his blackened lips of Muledom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you remember your mythology, the Minotaurs of Minos, well being fifty five and now tainted with our special brews what you can expect out of your remaining days is a body much like one of those Minotaurs. As they were bull mixed with manly parts, you shall become part man and part male Mule. I would like to point out that Mule's are sterile and once you complete the course, well your balls will be cut and we shall have a willing gelded Mulehuman!&quot; tells the man of what Paul should expect to happen.</p>
