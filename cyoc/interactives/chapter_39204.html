<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It has been three weeks since Kat and Danielle had started their accelerated portal training. They were now able to create their own portals and even create their own pocket universes. The spells were simple enough so the reason to go slow was to reduce the chances that they would come out in a far different place than they were aiming for. It was frightening to think that they could pop into a wall, a volcano, or even miles underwater where you'd be crushed before you had a chance to drown.<br />
<br />
A couple days after Kat had found Hank and prodded him to ask Danielle out. He had found her and did indeed asked to which she said yes. It was a little difficult to find a date that worked for both of them but they did. Now today was the day for Danielle's first date and she was nervous. Kat was in her room helping her get ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to be so nervous Dani&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there is&quot; Danielle said. &quot;This is my first date ever and I don't know how I'm going to feel. I still have mixed feelings about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sure you'll like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I can get past the fact that I was a boy and he's a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to stop thinking about having been a boy before. I'm sorry that I changed you but you had gotten on my nerves so often that I wanted to get even.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you have something against boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be right about that. I've had so many boys tease me. I think that I took my frustrations out on you even though you didn't tease me much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you tell me this before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a boy and you did tease me. I didn't think you would understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have a problem like that please tell me from now on. It will make things so much easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, and the same goes for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. What do you think of this dress?&quot; Danielle pulls out a flower print dress from her closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? It's ok for casual parties but not for a first date. You want something that hugs your body but doesn't make you look like a tramp. Where are you going again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To a fancy restaurant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a silk dress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You know how expensive they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as expensive as you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wear Peter tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it's not my day to have him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a special night so I don't mind if you take him tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it.&quot; Kat left and soon returned with Peter. &quot;I hope you don't mind if I'm the one to transform him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh not at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Kat took out her wand and muttered a spell. Peter glowed and changed a bit. The sleeves shrunk until they were no longer there and the hem lengthened until it was knee length. The neck scooped out while what was left of the sleeves continued to shrink until spaghetti straps were all that was left. The material changed to silk and the transformation was done. &quot;There, you have a nice red silk spaghetti strap dress for tonight. You won't need a bra for this dress. Now let's get this dress on you. Hank will be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle took off the towel she had wrapped around her. She had learned months ago not to be shy about being naked in front of girls so being naked in front of her sister was no big deal. She looked through her underwear and came up with a pair of red silk panties. Once she had her panties on she stepped into Peter and pulled him up. Once she had pulled him up Kat zipped her up.<br />
<br />
Danielle put on a pair of nude colored pantyhose and slipped on a pair of red high heels. She then sat down and put up some make up. In the middle of putting on her make up she asked &quot;Do you think he's going to want sex tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He may. You don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to. I know that you're going out of your comfort zone just by going out on a date with him. I have a question for you though. How come you haven't changed yourself back into a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that I'd lose my powers if I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mom had said you could learn a spell that would allow you to temporarily be one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to hear the truth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was afraid that you would transform me again. We weren't seeing eye to eye at the time. By the time we became more civil to each other I had gotten used to being a girl and a witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to change back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know. I don't think I could voluntarily give up my powers, even for a short while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DANIELLE! HANK IS HERE!&quot; their mother shouted up at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN MOM!&quot; Danielle shouted back. Turning to Kat she said &quot;Well, wish me luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
Danielle took a deep breath and went downstairs. As she descended the stairs she ran through different scenarios for tonight. Almost all of them had Hank asking her back to his house and having sex with him. She was surprised to find that the idea didn't immediately repulse her. Maybe she should just go with whatever happens.<br />
<br />
Danielle entered the living room and saw Hank. He was about six foot one with short red hair and green eyes. He was quite muscular as he worked out though he didn't play any sports. She knew he wanted to go to college and start his own business. She didn't know what his family plans were though. He looked at her and said &quot;You look beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a second&quot; Danielle's mother said. &quot;I want to get a picture of my daughter and her date. This is her first date after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Danielle said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
Danielle had to suffer through her mother taking pictures of her and Hank. She seemed to be happy with the picture at first but then seemed to change her mind. This happened over and over again until she was satisfied with the picture.<br />
<br />
Danielle and Hank were just about to leave when Kat came up and said &quot;You forgot your purse Dani.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you Kat&quot; Danielle said. &quot;You're such a good sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank led Danielle out to his car and opened her door for her. Once she was in Hank closed the door and got in himself.<br />
<br />
They didn't talk on the way to the restaurant. Once you had arrived Hank again opened your door and even held the restaurant door open for her. Once they were seated (Hank having pulled her chair out for her) Hank said &quot;You seem a little nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I am&quot; Danielle said. &quot;This is my first date with a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you've gone out with girls before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't had a date ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is your very first date. I can see why you would be nervous. I'm curious about something. It doesn't seem like you had really looked at any of us guys. Every time I saw you you were averting your gaze if you could. If you couldn't you seemed to be staring right past guys. You know that this has led to rumors of you being gay. What I want to know is why you didn't look at guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle was saved from answering at that moment when the waiter came to take their order. Hank placed his and was just about to order for her when she said that she could order for herself. There was such a thing as taking the gentleman thing too far. Once the waiter left Hank asked &quot;Are you going to answer my question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may not believe the answer to that&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because I used to be a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I've heard you have all the female parts and I don't think you can get that surgery done until you're eighteen. Besides you don't have an Adam's Apple and I don't see any scars on that pretty neck of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm having trouble thinking of you as anything but a girl. How did you become such a beautiful girl if you were a boy before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle was afraid that this would come up sometime but she didn't think that it would be this soon. She wanted to tell Hank the truth but she needed to be sure that he would accept it. &quot;Before I answer that I want you to answer a couple questions of mine&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you believe in the supernatural?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an open mind about it. There seems to be credible evidence of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about witches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I know there are those you say they're witches but I'm not sure if I believe they can turn people into toads.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you that real witches can do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose that you're a real witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am though I wasn't always one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it goes back a few months to when my sister turned eighteen. I was sixteen and my sister had just received her wand and spell book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second. I thought that you and your sister were twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we are now but I'll get to that. At the time I was a boy and my sister and I didn't get along too well. She had decided to transform me into a ten year old girl so she could have a little sister she could tease. I went to my mom and told her what happened. Kat had said she wouldn't remember but she muttered a spell and remembered anyway. She had told Kat to change me back but she said she didn't know how. My mom decided that the only way to protect me was by aging me to eighteen and making me Kat's twin sister. All the girls in my family become witches on their eighteenth birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you became a witch too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll forgive me if I find that a little hard to swallow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can prove it to you. Just not here with so many people around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can go back to my place after dinner. You can show me then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You trust me to go back to your house? Don't you think I'm crazy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do trust you and like I said, I like to keep an open mind. If you can -prove- your claim to me I'll believe you. If not then you're playing a joke on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when I prove that I'm a witch will you be scared?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank laughed and said &quot;I doubt that I'll be scared. I think it would be cool to have a witch for a girlfriend, even if she had been a guy before. I have something to confess to you. I've always been into transformations. If you really are a witch and you can transform me that would be like a dream come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the dinner went by with some small talk and afterward Danielle had to decided to go to Hank's house.</p>
