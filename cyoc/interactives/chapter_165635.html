<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Since I didn&#39;t really like the lack of characterization in the first version of the dragon chapter I wrote, in hindsight, I&#39;m giving it another shot here, with some other changes to further differentiate it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin decided to &#39;uplift&#39; his friends into more dragon anthros.  They clearly deserved the best, after all.  Though how to go about it in a way that best fit them?<br />
<br />
He looked over at Alister, who was biting into a sandwich, his eyes wandering in a way that suggested his mind was still elsewhere. Of the three, Alister had been the only one Colin knew to even be into furries, much less have a fursona, even if it wasn’t a dragon, so starting with him made the most sense.<br />
<br />
Alister’s character, he remembered, had been a rather nondescript brown wolf, with black hair, and usually wore plain T-shirts and jeans.  It seemed designed not to stand out.Then again, Colin realized, Alister’s choice of fursona didn’t have to be static, with his power.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Alister, I know you’re a furry.  Is your fursona a dragon?  Would you describe him for me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Yes.”  Alister droned.  He sighed as he regained his senses.  “I did it when I was younger, and I kinda regret it, but it stuck.  Going for a dragon makes it look like I think I’m a big shot or something.  I’ve tried to keep him pretty plain recently.  Blue and white, nothing too out of the ordinary design or backstory-wise.  The only thing I want to stand out about me is my art.”<br />
<br />
“Alister, are you a blue and white dragon anthro?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”  Alister’s body immediately straightened up, as he began to grow blue scales over most of his skin.  His clothes began to vanish, revealing thicker, white scutes on his chest, trailing down his front to the underside of his newly-forming tail, which stretched out several feet behind him already.  white, leathery wings appeared on his back, and a pair of simple, straight horns sprouted from the back of his head.  His mouth stretched forward into a triangular snout, while his ears shrank back to little holes in his head, and his pupils narrowed.  He reached with his new claws to grab another bite of his sandwich.  <br />
<br />
“I mean, it’s pretty obvious, right?  Don’t see why you’d need to ask.”<br />
<br />
“I was just… being rhetorical.”<br />
<br />
‘One down,’ Colin thought to himself. He turned to look at Sally. “Hey, are you into furries?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
‘Agh!’ Colin did his best not to show his frustration. After handling Alister’s situation so smoothly, he asked another yes/no question when he didn’t mean to. ‘Oh well. I was gonna make her an anthro dragon either way.’<br />
<br />
“Heh, what a coincidence,” Colin said aloud.<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean, do you really think it was a coincidence I wanted to hang out?” She suddenly winced. “Er... saying it like that, makes it sound like I’m friends with you out of some benevolent racism or something, and I don’t mean…”<br />
<br />
Colin chuckled. “It’s fine, don’t worry about it. So, what’s your fursona then?”<br />
<br />
“A queen honeybee,” she said quickly, eager to change the subject. “With a distinctly regal attitude and appearance.”<br />
<br />
“But don’t you happen to be a ‘queen’ of dragons, who’s like the bee queen you described, in some ways, in real life?”<br />
<br />
Another dull “yes” was heard as Sally’s skin turned deep purple, becoming firm and tough scales. Her waist narrowed subtly, while her hips and chest, in contrast, both increased, giving her an hourglass figure. Above her rear, her new tail forced its way through her pants, which began to unravel and disappear, along with the rest of her clothing. Her arms and legs both suddenly looked a bit thinner, as small claws appeared on her fingers and toes.  Her eyes become a solid, bright blue color, while her nose and mouth pressed forward into a short, almost cat-like snout.  Her ears fanned out to the sides, two inches in length.  Her hair turned white, as a mane of the same color sprouted from her spine, all the way down her tail.<br />
<br />
<br />
And just as had happened with his sister, Colin saw jewelry form from thin air on Sally’s body; a golden collar, jew-studded silver bracelets and anklets, gem stunned rings around her claws and tail, topped off with a shining, golden crown on her head, set to rest on her growing gazel-like horns. A scepter, tipped with an emerald, leaned on her chair beside her. her scales were polished to a near glowing sheen. Her figure having a sort of exaggerated beauty to it. <br />
<br />
Finally, a set of four shining, translucent insect wings unfurled from her back, buzzing softly a moment before settling down, completing the fairy-like dragon’s change.. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I didn’t think I should mess with perfection,” she said with a laugh. Then she looked at Colin. “Not that I don’t mind you appreciating my beauty, but it’s rude to stare, Colin.”<br />
<br />
“Right, yeah, my bad.” Colin quickly muttered, changing his focus. He didn’t want to leave Rex out of all this.<br />
<br />
“Hey Rex, if you could be a dragon like us, what do you think you’d look like?”<br />
<br />
Rex rolled his eyes slightly. “This question again, huh? I get it, I’m the only one here who isn’t some kinda reptile, no need to make a big deal about it.”<br />
<br />
“Be a dear and humor him, Rex,” Sally said, one hand resting idly on her scepter, another raising a piece of french toast to her mouth. “We all know how a dragon can be if they don’t get what they want.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, right,” Rex chuckled. “Well, I guess I’d go for something a little different.  Maybe a chinese style dragon.  They’re more about wisdom than destruction, usually.  If I had to be one, that’d be a fun pick.”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you an anthro chinese dragon already, though?”<br />
<br />
Rex droned an agreement as yellow scales sprouted from his skin, layering over each other to cover it almost completely. His nails shrank back, as claws poked through the tips of his fingers and toes instead. His toes grew longer, becoming almost like his hands in their dexterity.  His clothes began to disappear, allowing full view of the red mane tracing down from his head, to his back, to his rapidly-growing and quite lengthy tail. His ears shrank back, while his nose flared out and swelled, and his mouth stretched into a wide snout, filled with large, sharp fangs.    His body became longer and thinner, and he began to slowly lift off the ground, levitating by an unknown magic.  A pair of branching, antler-like horns sprouted from the back of his head, and a large pearl appeared in his left hand.<br />
<br />
“I suppose that is true.  Though, your questions are a little unusual.”<br />
<br />
Colin smiled, looking over the dragons seated with him at the table. This was a great start to his fun and games. But what to do next…?</p>
