<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mandy waited for Cody to come home, a thought came over her. &quot;Don&#39;t I have...&quot; Mandy walked back up to her delivery and searched for what she wanted. &quot;Here we go!&quot; Mandy pulled up another bottle of pills different from the one that reverts changes. &quot;Memory Molder&quot; was the name of the pills, which when taken would change the subject&#39;s memories to coincide with the changes. Thus, when Cody turned into an eight year old again, his mind would regress with him, his memories of years 9-18 gone. &quot;If I use this, then my Cody will not only look like an eight year old, he&#39;ll think like one too.&quot; Mandy realized that this course of action was good. She must have erred in raising her son, but with this she could start over, make sure he grew up to be a respectable man with a respectable dick. She took out a pill and placed it in the Fountain of Youth. It dissolved quickly enough and once again looked like plain old water. &quot;Excellent!&quot; And no sooner had it did, then did Cody walk through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m home!&quot; Cody yelled out. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m in the kitchen, honey!&quot; Mandy watched as Cody came inside. He was drenched in sweat. Evidentially, he must have just come back from a run. Wearing a plain white t-shirt and black shorts, his muscular body glistened through his shirt and his huge cock was partially hard in his pants. Looking at it caused Mandy to blush. &quot;Jesus Mom! I told you not to call me that anymore! I&#39;m not a little kid, I&#39;m a goddamn man! As you can tell.&quot; Cody spat out as he slapped his junk in a show of his manhood. &quot;Oh you...&quot; Mandy couldn&#39;t stand how much her son disrespected her, but she held her tongue this time. She would have control soon enough. &quot;Whatever...&quot; Cody momentarily wondered why his Mom didn&#39;t talk back to him, but paid it no mind. He was thirsty and needed a drink. His eyes caught a plastic cup of water. &quot;That yours?&quot; Cody asked. &quot;Oh no. No, no, no! I knew you&#39;d want some water, so I poured some out for you just now.&quot; &quot;Heh! You know me so well!&quot; Cody said somewhat sarcastically as he went to get the drink. Taking a deep breath, he chugged the entire thing down. Mandy watched him in anticipation for what was to come. After what felt like an eternity, Cody drank it down to last drop. &quot;Pwah! That hits the fucking spot!&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner did he say that, then did Cody&#39;s entire body shake. &quot;Brrrrr! Woah, freaking cold too! Umm...&quot; Something felt off. He meant to say fucking, but for some reason, he was unable to do so. And not because he didn&#39;t want to, but something in the back of his mind, told him he wasn&#39;t allowed to curse. Cody&#39;s eyes darted across the room. &quot;Something wrong, honey?&quot; Mandy asked, although she knew what was about to happen. &quot;None of your business! Ohhh... Ahhh...&quot; Cody moaned as his body felt drained. Dizzy, he tried to get ahold of himself. He moved towards the counter and placed both his hands on it. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Mandy asked, this time with a little smile. She could see him start to get smaller, his clothes a little looser. The Fountain of Youth in a Bottle was working.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! What&#39;s happening... to me?!&quot; Cody tried to focus on his hands, but it wasn&#39;t working. It looked like they were getting smaller. And his eyes were getting closer to the counter. &quot;Holy crap!&quot; He could even feel his hands getting smaller. This wasn&#39;t a hallucination. &quot;Ahhh!&quot; &quot;Honey?!&quot; Mandy pretended to be all flustered as her son got younger. He now looked 16. &quot;Ahh! Mom?! What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; &quot;I... I think you&#39;re getting younger!&quot; &quot;What?! No... I...&quot; Cody looked down as his body got smaller. His hard earned muscles were deflating before his eyes. His shirt was hanging looser and looser on him. His shorts barely held on. Mandy watched as her son continued to regress. He now looked 13. His shorts and boxers fell off, but his shirt was hanging off enough to cover his modesty. Mandy watched Cody became baby faced. Pimples broke out over his face. &quot;No! This can&#39;t be happening to me!&quot; Cody pulled his shirt up and watched as his huge cock and balls were a shell of their former self. They got smaller and smaller until they were in a state where they could never get hard. &quot;No! My dick! Aghhhhh! My voice!&quot; And as it did, Cody&#39;s voice soon matched the private parts he now had. He was about ten. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?! Help me, Mommy! Ah!&quot; As Cody asked his mother for help, his mind kept coming back to calling her Mommy. &quot;No! She&#39;s my mom! My Mom, goddammit!&quot; Cody thought, but what came out. &quot;No! She&#39;s my mommy! My Mommy, gosh darnit!&quot; &quot;Cody!&quot; Mandy exclaimed as she covered her mouth as if in sadness, but the smile she had behind her hand belied what she really knew. Cody was now eight years old. &quot;Aghhh! Gahhhhh!&quot; Cody held his head as his mind was scrambled. Everything he knew was fading away. Well, that wasn&#39;t quite right. His memories from when he was eight were as clear as day. Cody thrashed about. He came out of his shoes easily. &quot;Gahhh! Mom! Mommy! Fuck! Frig!&quot; As his mind alternated between 8 and 18, he threw his head back. &quot;Guh! Guh!&quot; His head jerked back several times as his eyes glazed over and drool dribbled from his mouth. &quot;Guh!&quot; One more violent jerk back and Cody dropped to the floor unconscious. He fell back out of his shorts and laid on the floor. A few seconds later, the unconscious boy started to pee himself.<br />
<br />
Mandy waited for him to stop peeing and when he did, she picked him off the floor and out of his oversized shirt. &quot;There, there, honey. It&#39;s alright now.&quot; She looked at his tiny penis dribbling leftover urine. She wiggled it to make sure she wasn&#39;t hallucinating herself, but it was indeed as small as it looked. &quot;It&#39;s alright. You&#39;re my little boy and I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re treated right this time.&quot; And with that Mandy brought her now young son up to his room.</p>
