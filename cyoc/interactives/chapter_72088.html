<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harms shifted in his seat, and was about to get up when he noticed something on his desk. A memo! It was a couple of pages long and was from the guidance counselor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Harms, we've been receiving an unusual amount of people transferring out of the school. For some reason, quite a few boys think Jefferson high isn't adequate for them and they've signed on for online courses. Enclosed are the students, at least 50, all boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brushing a few beads of sweat from his brow, Harms went through the list with disinterest. Why should he care? All that mattered right now was finding Connie. The names on the list didn't strike him as unusual. Most of them were pretty average or nerdy kids, the kind he let others beat up in the locker room, turning a blind eye. One name that struck him as amusing was Phil Leowitz, a loser into bad comics and horror movies. Those kids were shut-ins who'd never fit in society. People who'd never get girlfriends. Chuckling to himself, Harms threw the sheet in the trashcan.  <br />
<br />
Opening his desk, he rummaged through it's contents, poorly organized. After a few minutes of this he got up and leafed through his narrow bookshelf, tightening the cords on his dangling pants. Aha! There it was, the last year's yearbook! Harms grabbed the glossy book and locked the door to office, throwing himself on his chair. Finally!<br />
<br />
With trembling hands Harms leafed through the yearbook with furious speed, looking for any trace of Connie. He was unaware that as he perused the book, his hands were becoming smaller and daintier, nails clean and polished, calluses from hard work fading into the soft skin of youth.Connie was such a sweet name....<br />
<br />
There it was! Straight in the picture section. Connie Page! She was a freshman in this book, which meant she was a sophomore now. She had long red hair and such a cute face! Harms blushed at the thought of kissing her. And as he blushed, his skin began grower fairer, years of accumulated tan fading away. All those days spent outside were wiped clean from skin, which grew soft like his hands.<br />
<br />
Looking through his records, he couldn't see a Connie Page in his files. Well, that sort of made sense, since girls weren't likely to sign up for P.E anyways these days. They'd rather sign up for the health class. So how was he going to find Connie? He could go to the guidance counselor, but that would be pretty awkward. But maybe she had a facebook. Eagerly typing in the site, Charms squirmed in his chair waiting for the page to load up.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Harms felt a little itchy. But how could he be itchy? Rubbing his now hairless arms, Harms didn't see his body hair shed from his frame, piling up on the floor and evaporating.&lt;Good to see that the Nair has been working&gt;, thought Harms as he ran a hand through his thicker and now full-bodied hair.&lt;And the Rogaine too&gt;....<br />
<br />
Looking through her page, Harms felt hornier and hornier. She was so great! She was on the debate team, and in the eco-club! A girl that would care about others, especially him. And best of all, she was single! Harms felt a large bulge in his pants. He was so horny, it was consuming him. Images of Connie were flashing in his mind,desire was strong in him.<br />
<br />
But before he could attend to his bodily needs, the bell rung!Cursing his luck he left the side door in his office and went to his class of 100 students in the gym. They were already dressed out except for a knot of of ten or so students wearing stylish clothes and talking and texting on their phones. They were all blonde, long-haired,blue eyed and rather short and skinny. Normally Harms would chew them out and force them to do pushups, but not today. They were young, and he could tell just by their faces that they were in love. And in the end, what was so wrong with that?<br />
<br />
Harms took attendance, coughing every dozen or so names, voice getting slightly higher in pitch each time. By the end of it he was getting concerned looks from a few of his students. But he was oblivious to their states and he called a free day. The students immediately began taking laps around the gym and some set up a couple of basketball games(half court). Everyone was busy except for his ten blond students, young faces smiling as they sat in the bleachers, talking about their girlfriends and how to keep their interest.<br />
<br />
Harms was bored himself, so he went over to one of the basketball games. Normally he was great, and students loved having him on their team, he was a wildcard that no one could beat. But today he was totally off. Whenever he found himself withe ball, he quickly found someone dribbling it out his hands, Harms too busy thinking about Connie to even care.<br />
<br />
Running up and down the court got Harms tired surprisingly fast. The more he exerted himself, the weaker he got. The muscles in his arms and legs were practically melting away.His figure was rather lean and lanky, but his baggy jumpsuit did a good job hiding this. Practically gasping for breath, he just couldn't keep up and went near the bleachers, sitting near the blond kids, talking excitedly about a party.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my gf said that she was arranging a party!&quot;<br />
&quot;Mine too, man!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah it's going to be great, there's going to be a ton of people!&quot;<br />
<br />
They began talking about preparation for the party and Harms began to feel a little anxious. Maybe one of these kids could help get Connie's attention?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh&quot;, Harm's voice went up in pitch a bit. The other boys were completely oblivious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, I was wondering if one of you could help me...&quot;. One boy peeled off from the discussion and gave harms a rather distracted look, ready to go back to his circle at a moment's notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's this girl called Connie, and I was hopping you could give some me help getting her attention...&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond boy gave him a dashing smile &quot;Sure, sure. I know how important that is Coach Harms! Kelly loves it that I look like this. I'm so happy that I make her happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde boy dug into his backpack(brushing aside his curls!) and pulled out a few things, and gave them to coach Harms.<br />
<br />
It was a pack of gum and some bodyspray. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but you don't have to call me Coach you know, Johnny is fine too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing a girl likes more than a clean guy,Johnny!&quot; With that, he went back to his friends eagerly talking about the party. Johnny made a mental note where it is. He was sure Connie would love going to a big party like that.<br />
<br />
Finally, the class ended and his students hit the showers, going to their respective classes and scattering. Now it was the last period of the day. And the showers all all his own. That blonde boy said that girls love a clean guy. He should shower too, show Connie he was a cut above the competition.<br />
<br />
Johnny grabbed his soap and shampoo and headed to the showers, his clothing falling easily off of him. Heading to one of the showers, he turns it on full blast and lets the warm water greet his face as he began lathering up with soap.<br />
<br />
He began cleaning his soft and youthful body unaware that as he did so, he was diminishing in size, shrinking until he reached maybe only five feet in height. As his boyish hands reached his maleness, he stopped.<br />
<br />
Since when was he so big? Images of Connie flashed through his face and he began stroking his hairless crotch. As his young hands began stroking his maleness, it began to shrink, becoming smaller and smaller until it fit in his hand with plenty of room to spare.His balls going higher and higher back into his body. But he was so excited and began pumping himself harder and harder until his knees buckled, crying out in a young tone as he had a dry orgasm.<br />
<br />
Gasping in pleasure he began washing his face, which became younger and sweeter looking, taking a rather cute cast. His blue eyes were in a haze of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Finally, he shampooed his hair. As he lathered it up, it grew longer until it settled in his shoulder blades, forcing him to use a lot more shampoo than usual&lt;Man, with this much Shampoo, Connie will fall for me for sure!&gt; Rinsing it out, he saw that his hair had transformed to a gorgeous bright blonde, full of body and shine.&lt;This is is some weird shampoo! Good thing I always liked blonde hair&gt;. Turning off the faucet, the youthful figure shook his hair and grabbed his towel, body shrouded in vapor.<br />
<br />
Toweling off his hair, it settled into curls that accentuated his face and framed it quite nicely. Ignoring his discarded clothes, he grabbed his master key and unlocked a locker, checking out some new clothes that to his pleasure fit him rather nicely.<br />
<br />
A green polo, some khakis and flip-flops and he was good to go!<br />
<br />
Laughing to himself as he sat down in his larger desk chair, he popped some gum in his mouth, teeth turning a brilliant white.<br />
<br />
He went back to facebook and began stroking at his small bulge, perfectly content and happy in the world.<br />
<br />
But alas, this was not to be, as he heard the familiar voice of Clarkson at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Harms, an ex-student who just transferred to online courses came to see me today. I think he has some information that you might find useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny gave a grunt.<br />
<br />
Mr.Clarkson rapped on the door and said &quot;Is that you Harms? Are you all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, just a grunt, but one that seemed more forced this time.<br />
<br />
The ex-student turned to Mr.Clarkson. &quot;Mr. Clarkson, is Coach Harms fine? Or is someone in his office?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets find out,Jim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr.Clarkson pulled out his keys and unlocked the office.<br />
<br />
The pair was surprised to see the blonde youth standing before them with a flushed face, grinning embarrassingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clarkson, couldn't you leave me alone? I was pretty busy at the moment. I was doing some research.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr.Clarkson was shocked.&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm Coach Harms, but you can call me Johnny!&quot; And with that, he flashed a bright grin.&quot;Can you leave? I was going to ask Connie out on a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim looked at him hard. &quot;Mr.Clarkson, this was exactly what happened to Rick. He was normal and then he ended up like THAT.&quot; He gestured sharply at Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I just have a hard time believing this is even possible.&quot; Mr.Clarkson  went over to the computer and turned off the monitor, much to the complaint of Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Johnny,&quot; said Jim&quot;Did you get a love letter? Or a Valentine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh! Connie said that we would be perfect together!&quot; Johnny's face took a dreamy look, obviously in the middle of romantic daydreams. <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me Coach, where is that Valentine? Give it to me.&quot; Mr.Clarkson held out his hand authoritatively and Johnny dropped it into his hand. Before he could even read it, it crumbled to ash, pink glitter sparkling on his hand for just a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, school is over, but maybe we can have a chat about this? Katie kept mentioning magic notes, maybe we can find a place that sells these things in town.&quot; Jim was clearly nervous. Frankly, he'd rather be anywhere else. But a nagging sense of duty to his doomed friend Rick brought him back to this situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good idea son, but first we need to take care of Coach Harms.&quot; He gestured to the blonde youth, twiddling his thumbs in boredom, mind clearly somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Jim nodded and the duo left the office, grabbing Johnny by the shoulders as they left.</p>
