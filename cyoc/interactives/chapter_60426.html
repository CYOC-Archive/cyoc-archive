<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Ben awoke and wandered into the main room to find a strange scene.<br />
<br />
Both Mark and Darrren's beds were closer together than they had been last night, almost next to one another in fact, and weirder, <br />
Darren's hand was in Mark's, both the boys' arms spanning the short distance between the beds.<br />
<br />
'Weird.' Ben thought and shook his head blearily, then continued to the bathroom to shower and get ready for class. Being 21 didn't <br />
mean anything if your term papers were late.<br />
<br />
As he neared the bathroom door wiping the odd image of his two straight room-mates out of his head, he remembered the great buzz <br />
he'd had while laying in bed last night. He'd wished that Darren understood how he felt. It was a big thing to come out. He just wanted <br />
to know that Darren wasn't just saying whatever, he had wished that his friend knew what it was like to be gay.<br />
<br />
'Stupid.' He thought to himself. Why waste my time wishing things like that, he is who he is and I'm lucky he still wants to be friends. 'It's <br />
like me wishing for better muscles ...' he thought.<br />
<br />
He looked at his body in the mirror. It wasn't bad by any means, he was a jock, fit and strapping, tall and handsome looking, but he'd <br />
only become a jock in the last few years, once he'd started university. Before then he'd been wiry and 'strapping' was the last word <br />
anyone would have used to describe him. Now though, he was taller, built like a proper athlete - almost - and a pretty good catch, if he <br />
did say so himself. Countless hours in the gym, pool, on the field and years of eating right and training hard had sculpted this body for <br />
him.<br />
<br />
He ran his hand over his smooth chest, over the abs and up onto his slab-like pecs. 'It's be good to break 90kg though...' he imagined, <br />
looking at his reflection. Then laughed at himself and turned for the shower. 'How egocentric'.<br />
<br />
Out loud he then added, &quot;I wish I was 100 kilos, not 88, sure. But I'm gonna have to work for that. Might as well wish I was 24 so I don't <br />
have to put in the work though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hot water hissed on as he turned the knobs, and soon he was standing under the warmth of the water flowing over him, he closed <br />
his eyes and lathered up the soap, imagining the scene he'd caught out in the main room was actually what he imagined it was, that his <br />
two straight roomies actually liked each other.<br />
<br />
As he did he smiled, and his cock began to get a bit harder. He stepped out of the water for a second, eyes still closed, and soaped <br />
himself up. He'd be sweaty again after tonight's workout, but for now it would be nice to be clean.<br />
<br />
His hand rubbed over his arms, which in the heat of the shower seemed to feel thicker somehow. His shoulders were next, and they too <br />
felt different.<br />
<br />
His heart was beating a little quicker as his cock raised itself to half-mast, getting thicker, he could feel it as his hands reached his chest <br />
and he began lathering his pecs.<br />
<br />
'Whoa!' he thought, as his hands ran over something strange.<br />
<br />
He couldn't open his eyes as there was soap all over his face, but it felt like his chest was dirty or ... or hairier.<br />
<br />
He moved his hands back across them. Not only did they feel like they had a light dusting of hair, but they felt fuller somehow, thicker <br />
than before.<br />
<br />
'What is going ...' he said inwardly, before noticing that his cock had begun slapping him in the stomach.<br />
<br />
Hard as a rock, as he left his chest and hands roamed downward toward his aching member he noticed something else about it. His <br />
hands reached it before he thought they would.<br />
<br />
Odd, but not unpleasant, perhaps the heat of the shower was messing with his head. He wrapped a hand around the shaft, which <br />
immediately felt incredible. Pleasure surged through his fit, soaped up body and he rolled his head back in pleasure, letting a moan out <br />
as he slid the hand up the shaft to his head. His cock was longer. Much longer, about an inch if his hand was anything to go by, and it <br />
felt incredible. With that hand stroking he lifted his other hand and caressed his pecs again. Once more he found that they felt different. <br />
Bigger. He was starting to feel different all over, in fact. Heavier or thicker. His hand slid to his shoulders, his opposite upperarm, and <br />
the bicep and tricep bulged in ways they hadn't before, meatier and powerful feeling.<br />
<br />
His cock was straining from his crotch, pulsing and getting a mean workout from Ben's hand which was gripping hard and grinding up <br />
and down, the shaft feeling slightly longer even now and the head so sensitive, the pleasure was driving him wild.<br />
<br />
Back to his chest, the hairiness seemed to have increased more, and his fingers ran through a short, fine but thickening coating of fur.<br />
<br />
His moans became slightly louder as he continued to beat off, and soon enough he stepped under the water to rinse the soap, but his <br />
hands continued exploring his changing body.<br />
<br />
Heavier he felt still, muscles seeming larger to his touch than they had ever been, his cock now rubbing against the hairs on his <br />
stomach and adding to the pleasure.<br />
<br />
The hand rubbing his pecs now moved downward to join in, along the pectorals, town their larger, angular bottom edges to his abs. Or <br />
at least, to where his abs should have been. With some slight concern he noted that his stomach didn't feel as tight as it should have, <br />
not like it had last night. The ripped ridges of his eight pack seemed to be softer now, he had to press his fingers in to reach the muscle <br />
beneath, but the muscle felt incredible.<br />
<br />
Again he was struck by the feeling of hair, and in the pleasure, and ignoring the new softness of his midsection, he put his second hand <br />
under the one already working his thickening cock and started massaging his balls. A gasp escaped his lips as he felt that his balls, too, <br />
had grown larger.<br />
<br />
What had been the size of big olives yesterday were now bigger than cumquats.<br />
<br />
He was close to cumming when he leant back against the wall, hot water streaming down onto him and his hands working his newly <br />
enlarged equipment, and he noticed that he hit with more impact than before, his wish changing him still and bulk still adding to his <br />
already beefy, jock frame.<br />
<br />
Finally and with explosive force, he came, sending streams of cum shooting across the shower to his the glass with an audible thump, <br />
before he collapsed from exhaustion under the flowing water and recovered with heavy breaths.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later he opened his eyes, and without noting his changed form yet, cleaned up the shower, stepped out and began to dry <br />
himself off. When the steam began to clear from the mirror he was finally able to see what had actually happened to him.<br />
<br />
Gone was the boyishly fit physique that had given him the appearance of a swimmer and weight-enthusiast. Now he looked like a real <br />
man.<br />
<br />
He had grown, not just in muscularity, but height as well by the looks of it. He looked older, that was for sure, but it only added to his <br />
incredible attractiveness. His jaw was stronger, more pronounced, and his face was covered in thick stubble. His muscles bulged from <br />
everywhere, upgrading him from swimmer to heavyweight wrestler. And as he began to run his hands over himself, exploring the new <br />
size, other things became apparent. His adam's apple was larger, his chest covered in a substantial coating of light brown / blond hair, <br />
which spread down in a snail trail to his now enlarged cock, which hung lower and thicker than it had yesterday. He had bloomed into a <br />
hunky mid twenties, and then he noticed that it had come with perks.<br />
<br />
His legs were thicker also, the calves bulging in thick diamonds and thighs almost pressing against each other, and both legs were <br />
hairier than ever. His feet were almost two sizes bigger as well. This he didn't mind, but turning to the side he noticed that in the few <br />
years he'd aged, he must have been not just a jock, but a beer-swilling jock. His abs, which he had always prized and loved, were now <br />
covered by a small smooth beer gut. It wasn't overly big. In fact it kind of suited him and his now more husky-fied look.<br />
<br />
The more he looked at it though, the more he seemed to like it, and soon his cock was rising to attention again. Looking himself over he <br />
was pleased, and pretty turned on, by what he saw.<br />
<br />
His hands went to his member once again, now rock hard and throbbing.<br />
<br />
That's when Ben noticed that the door was open behind him, and Darren was standing there, rubbing his eyes and staring in disbelief at <br />
the muscled hunk standing in front of him.</p>
