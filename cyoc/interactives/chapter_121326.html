<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES:<br />
1. I&#39;ve looked over all the recent episodes, and cannot find a last name for Claire. Normally I&#39;d leave that to the person who introduced Claire to the story, but the &quot;Catching Up With Old Friends&quot; episode is unsigned. Thoughts on a last name for Claire?<br />
2. I was writing this while The Werewolf Prince was posting the previous chapter so, not wanting my efforts to go to waste, I edited accordingly before posting.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Claire looked at her new friend (lover?) and thought back on their wild night together.<br />
Less than 12 hours ago, Claire had been a normal, heterosexual woman.<br />
Now, thanks to Jen Decker, Claire was a calico furred Japanese Bobtail Werecat with only one thought on her mind once her first transformation had finished: getting more of the delicious cream that changed her.<br />
The two women had been in the classic 69 position far longer than Jen thought possible.<br />
<i>Claire&#39;s insatiable!</i> she realized, but didn&#39;t mind, because the black furred Persian Werecat was giving at least as good as she got, if not better.<br />
<i>Considering she hasn&#39;t been one that long, Claire&#39;s not only got a werecat&#39;s natural talents for sex, but her honey tastes pretty good too.</i><br />
If asked, neither woman could swear to how many orgasms they actually had, let alone gave in return.<br />
All either of them knew for sure was that their respective tails swished happily as they continued to drink deeply from each other&#39;s pussies.<br />
The hard nipples of their breasts rubbed erotically against each other&#39;s furry chests.<br />
<i>I wonder how those taste?</i> The idle thought passed through Jen&#39;s mind even as another wave of pleasure racked her body.<br />
<br />
Jen wondered how long the feast would go on, when suddenly Claire broke away from her.<br />
She was about to ask if something was wrong, when Claire switched positions. &quot;My tummy&#39;s full, but in a good way,&quot; announced Claire, before she snuggled up against Jen and started kissing her.<br />
The taste of herself on a lover&#39;s lips wasn&#39;t new to Jen, but each time was different.<br />
<i>Claire&#39;s are...</i> Jen discovered that she didn&#39;t have the words to accurately describe it.<br />
&quot;OH! I feel so great!&quot; purred Claire, cuddling up against Jen. &quot;Thank you!&quot; she added, before kissing Jen again.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Jen said with a smile, holding her new friend close.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always dreamed of this moment since moving to Moon Lake and finding out it was possible, but now...&quot; said Claire, before laying within Jen&#39;s arms and beginning to caress her furry body.<br />
The two werecats just laid in Jen&#39;s bed for awhile, holding each other.<br />
Then, Claire looked at Jen and said, &quot;Listen, I&#39;m not sure yet whether I&#39;m just bi or an outright lesbian now since becoming a werecat, but there&#39;s one thing I do know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? What?&quot; asked Jen out of curiosity.<br />
&quot;I hope I&#39;m not out of line saying this, but I&#39;d like to see you again,&quot; admitted Claire. &quot;Socially. Not just sexually. I thought we could hang out, maybe even go on a few dates, and see where things lead us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Claire. I—&quot; began Jen.<br />
&quot;What? Too soon?&quot;<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t just that. But, ever since my husband was killed...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Claire, realizing what Jen was getting at. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; before starting to move to get out of the bed.<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; said Jen, grabbing Claire&#39;s paw before her feet touched the floor.<br />
Claire turned to look at Jen.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying anything <i>will</i> happen between us. Right now, I&#39;m not sure if I even want anything to ever happen between me and anybody else. My husband was a very special man, and he will always have a place in my heart,&quot; explained Jen, while sitting up and moving physically closer to Claire. &quot;But I do realize one thing. It&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve let anyone other than my son into my life. I can&#39;t promise you the future, but I can give you at least the rest of tonight,&quot; she added with a smile on her muzzle.<br />
Claire looked deeply into Jen&#39;s feline eyes and said, &quot;I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t want more, but I&#39;m willing to accept whatever you&#39;re willing to share with me.&quot;<br />
With that, the two werecats crawled back into bed and hugged each other close, wondering where the rest of this night would take them, and what the future held.<br />
<br />
<i>It was one hell of a night!</i> Claire remembered fondly, while sneaking peeks at Jen whenever she could.<br />
While alone upstairs, Claire had changed back and greatly admired her new and improved human form in the bedroom mirror, but found that her old clothes didn&#39;t fit quite as good as they used too.<br />
<i>A small price to pay,</i> Claire conceded.<br />
<i>Even these are better than they used to be,</i> she thought happily, while briefly cupping her now larger breasts.<br />
<br />
Back downstairs, Claire just couldn&#39;t keep her eyes off Jen, and didn&#39;t care whether she was caught staring or not.<br />
 <i>I&#39;m still not completely sure whether I&#39;m just bi or a full fledged lesbian now, but I do know how my heart feels. Maybe it&#39;s just part of being a werecat, but there IS something special about you Jennifer Decker, and I would love to find out if there can ever be anything between us. Especially if, in time, you might grow to feel the same way about me that I do you.</i><br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE THAT HALLOWEEN NIGHT...<br />
Not knowing about his mother&#39;s plans to initiate Claire into were society, Tad Decker walked his girlfriend Amy Howler home.<br />
Amy knew that with their own Halloween activities, the rest of her family wouldn&#39;t be home for hours, and was prepared to invite Tad inside up to her bedroom, and inside of her for some hot and heavy werewolf sex.<br />
Yet Amy was totally surprised when, instead of walking her up to the front door, Tad escorted Amy around to her backyard and motioned for her to sit in one of the lawn chairs that had been left out.<br />
Then Tad grabbed another lawn chair and positioned it so they were sitting face to face before he occupied it.<br />
&quot;Amy...&quot; began Tad, taking her paws in his.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope I&#39;m not out of line saying this, but ever since we met, I feel different around you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Different how?&quot; wondered Amy.<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re special, but you make me feel special too,&quot; answered Tad. &quot;It&#39;s as if, no other weres matter in the whole world but the two of us, and I want to be the very best man and wolf I can be, for you.&quot;<br />
If Amy Howler wasn&#39;t within her fursona right now, she knew her cheeks would be turning such a bright shade of red at that moment...<br />
&quot;I know we both have to finish high school, and have college ahead of us,&quot; began Tad, &quot;but I was wondering...&quot;<br />
<i>He can&#39;t be about to propose. Can he?</i> thought Amy, while staring at him.<br />
&quot;I was wondering if, you&#39;d be willing to go steady with me.&quot;<br />
&quot;S-steady?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m seriously out of touch in some social areas, given my life before moving to Moon Lake,&quot; explained Tad, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to see anyone else but you. So I was hoping that...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; said Amy, before leaning forward to give Tad a big, long kiss. It wasn&#39;t exactly what she dreamed of, but it did put her one step closer to someday becoming Mrs. Amy Decker.<br />
<br />
When the lips of their lupine muzzles parted, Tad looked at her and said, &quot;Then, after we graduate high school and college...&quot;<br />
Tad Decker was totally shocked when the she-wolf leaped out of her lawn chair.<br />
The momentum of her jump knocked Tad backward out of his chair, landing flat on his back against the grass.<br />
The next thing he knew, the pants of his Halloween costume were ripped open as Amy grabbed his rapidly growing red rocket in one paw, raised the hem of her costume&#39;s skirt with the other, and mounted him.<br />
&quot;Yes, my darling!&quot; she promised him, even as Amy started riding Tad.<br />
It didn&#39;t take long before both werewolves were howling together as they experienced mutual orgasmic bliss, and it certainly wouldn&#39;t be the last time that night, or in the years to come.</p>
