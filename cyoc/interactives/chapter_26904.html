<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason Ferric:<br />
<br />
Mr. Ferric was until the summer before last, a prisoner of the state penitentiary. His slender build and lack of knowledge to the manly art of self-defense left him as easy prey for those other prisoners, they to whom thought and used Mason for varied sexual frolic.<br />
<br />
After server severe beatings and repeated times in the prison hospital, the warden thought of Sunrise Research, and our varied terms of volunteer based experiments.<br />
<br />
Mason thought our offer form him to become as a scientific volunteer in our animal husbandry experiments as something interesting. Almost without even reading the contract, he signed it, and insisted upon his transfer that very day.<br />
<br />
Once he arrived at Laboratory # 7, our first step in a chain of intense assertions to his reproductive organs, and enhancing properties to the digestive system, he went directly into preparation for the Bovine Serum.<br />
<br />
Mason read as much as we did allow, asking then of pertinent questions regarding what the experiment might do to him, as if any changes or drug reactions for which he should become aware. <br />
<br />
Informed in very general terminology, Mason listened intently when informed that during the experiment he would endure many physical changes to his body, undergoing some surgical transitions of muscle, bone, and organs. He received this information with a nonchalant and causal manner, suggesting that since he was on death row, his change of physical demeanor was of little consequence.<br />
<br />
Mason became elated upon hearing how his reproductive ability would become a major part of the testing, as on a regular and almost daily basis the act of mating was involved.<br />
<br />
The first injections from Professor Haun of his historic Bovine Reformation Serum caused Mason to slip calmly into a comatose state.<br />
<br />
In the Bovine experiment, the Professor deemed it as a necessity for Mason to remain in coma for three weeks; where when awakened from his slumber he saw his bodily transition and became violent.<br />
 <br />
The first transition of species comes with the physical changes to all soft tissues, organs, and skin color, including the growth of hair.<br />
<br />
A screaming man stood for long hours seeming taking note, and after a day, he became docile, admiring his soft fur and the increase of sensual response, adding proportionally to his gentiles.<br />
<br />
Bone structure began and caused Mason dire headaches, leaving him to lie on his cell cot reeling of pain as the skull and spinal column began to accept the chemically induced transitions.<br />
<br />
Due to his increased strength and insisted tendency to become angered easily, Professor Haun used a tranquilizer dart, sedating Mason until the skull finalized, becoming totally as that of a bovine.<br />
<br />
The question of mental anguish and possible insanity became a real issue. An agreement between staff and the Professor kept Mason sedated until his torso was in the final station of bovine configuration.<br />
<br />
Professor Haun is in our mindset one of the most compassionate scientists when he allowed Mason to become awake in slow and informative assertions. In so doing, Mason became aware of his drastic physical transition of species. This allowed the Professor to introduce new thought patterns into a dreamy state of mind to which Mason could only listen and do little else.<br />
<br />
When fully awakened, Mason stood again before his full-length mirror, eyeing his changed body, seemingly admiring it, and making sounds as if what he saw was to his personal delight. <br />
<br />
In general terms of retrospect, Mason stood as if an excellent reproduction of a Greek Minotaur. His head had transitioned; neck gaining enough mass and length to mirror the bull he would in a short amount of time become, and learn to function. The skull had surgical implants of horn buds, these growing, and with maturing; he should have an exceptional pair of horns.<br />
<br />
<br />
It should be noted that the State Prison board of prisoner wellbeing voted unanimously, authorizing Sunrise Research, Professor Haun all rights to experiment on a death row inmate. The acquisition of these said rights did not limit to the prisoner Mason Ferric, but gave unlimited authorization to utilize any inmate from off death row. As according to the actual minutes from that historic meeting, all there thought of what Professor Haun proposed doing, to be in the interest of society, and as a proper, second judgment of those who took another person’s life. <br />
<br />
 Mason began showing increase satisfaction from how his male organ, penis, sheath, and testicles were of bovine contours, and the increased length and sensuality when touched. Although his records did not refer to his admitting of being gay, he began some tendency to stroking his shaft, and producing major orgasms. <br />
<br />
The Professor took samples of the ejaculated semen, announcing the DNA transfer had moved to the acquired phase, asserting that with due time Mister Mason Ferric would transition, becoming bovine, and saving the state a great amount of money spent to house, feed, and guard certain prisoners.<br />
<br />
The final Acquired Phase in his experiment causes the arms and legs to change, moving into proper contours of the bovine species. Once this enhancement completed, Mason stood and walked on all fours, his demeanor changed, and seemingly became agreeable to his living as if born a bovine.<br />
<br />
It is a concern over the general treatment of Mason, his becoming very bovine of form tended to loss of all personal consideration of healthy hygiene. Even when standing like some Minotaur he often failed to make use of toilet paper, as the boney tail would swish and spread his remaining feces over his hairy buttocks.<br />
<br />
Professor Haun distinctly made reference to the manner in which all the other bovines lived at Sunrise Farm. His insistence on Mason learning the common lifestyle of bovine bull mannerisms was an imperative necessity for the experiment to lead into more wide use of the Reformation serum.<br />
<br />
Since that first day as Mason took part in his transition to being a bovine and bull, he has become successful as a sire. The birthing rate of calves has tripled due to his kind and gentle manner of mating. To date he is the proud sire of 221 calves, 72 born as bulls, and the remaining 149 were heifers.<br />
<br />
As from this exception record, Professor Haun requested the Prison Board to affirm Mason Ferric as a permanent intern of Sunrise Research, and its many associated farms and feedlots.<br />
<br />
The afore seen picture was taken when Mason Ferric received the happy news of his committed sentence, and of how Professor Haun arranged for Mason to continue permanently in his new status.<br />
<br />
All records of prisoner 23-411 Mason Ferric marked as closed, filed in long-term pending, as his reassignment and change of species terminates the responsibilities of state and prison officials.<br />
