<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Living on Planet Earth was incredibly cumbersome. His Giant stature eclipses small countries in an eternal night while being generally a nuisance to planes that zip underneath his weather causing pecs. Force to sign a World resident classification by the UN he was forced to carefully monitor every movement he makes as to ensure minimum casualties to nearby countries. Considering his size relative to everything on Earth it&#39;s understandable. His scientifically impossible body continued to baffle the world over. He usually set camp several miles out of Bakersfield, CA in the USA as little people live outside that general area. Trying to speak to other people was always hard. when the reception on his receiver gets obscured by his own body. a Satellite was launched devoted to only receiving his signal so that the world can more accurately receive the voice of the Giant. One of those days was him sunbathing on top of the Mojave Desert. His Director giddy about a prospect of new movie roles as the set. He was too big to be an actual actor. So he has been reduced to a background asset and a large narrator voice that work moves the main character through his body. His own body is was itself a topological marvel. his actual canyon deep abs formed some intense scenes in movie cuts that the director sends via a live stream feed to Ben. He wasn&#39;t sure how to feel regarding being used like this. But he much rather this than being a lapdog military man to the UN peacekeeping force. He was seriously considering shrinking down his size to something manageable. Unable to bring himself to shrinking, however, keep his rational mind from ever fully committing to that decision. over time his tonnage filled out his 12-mile frame. Sitting at a ludicrous 110,398,464,000 tons any number to measure him seemed ridiculous on paper. in his interview, he joked to reporters that he was only a few hundred million something tons before joking about moving a few zeros over stating he was actually something around 100 billion tons. Causing the world to stand in awe at such a large slab of meat. No one could fathom how effortlessly he carried such huge weights on him. He laughed for a person as big as me anything is possible. the world laughed in response. watching the live stream earnestly trying to watch the actors walk around his abs. but he felt a sudden strange sensation return. That tingling sensation he has all too readily accustomed to. Its been 1 year since he broke 10 miles tall why was he growing? Opening another tab he saw Transformation.net. on. wonder when he clicked to grow more he saw that he inputted the growth and muscle options again. I said 5 minutes ago. Stunned he suddenly realized what it was. his OLD computer stuck deep inside his pecs must have remained on the entire time. and his muscles must have enabled those command again. struggling against his expanding muscle he phoned the director to cancel the production right now. flipping to the live stream feed he could see the actors suddenly grow concern as the walls of his abs rose higher. the director began to drive his jeep and the crew out. It was fortunate they were filming only half a mile inside one of his abs. But maybe he was being optimistic. The pleasurable sense of him growing became almost too much. ensuring people leaving his body was priority number one. Feeling the growth surging he focus on trying not to flex. Trying to restrain himself was so hard his body began to heat up again watching the jeep sail out of his abs was a relief he couldn&#39;t hold back the growth for much longer so he stood up and began making his way to the ocean. Unfortunately, he began exploding in size as soon as he was standing. His Giant pecs began swelling out further than he could reach. Struggling with his body he descended upon the oceans with endless mounds of flesh. unable to change the setting until the primary computer was off he began to shove his arms into his pecs. trying to remove the puny computer from inside a crevice between his 5th and 6th strata of his pecs. using his webcam screen on his old computer he gingerly tried to find his fingers on the camera feed. It was so hard, his chest was on fire as his arms restricted its ability to grow. trying to push further he finally saw his fingers through the monitor. spending a clumsy few minutes fishing his computer out he finally was able to get it set perfectly near enough to turn off the settings. almost confirming his request the fire in his chest burst. sending the computer soaring miles off the side of his giant pecs. he groaned as he soared higher into the sky. clumsy fumbling his meaty arms around he watched as the computer continued to fall down slowly alongside his chest. eventually catching it on his hand before his hands violent jerked away pushing his computer far to the side as his hands were paralyzed by his expanding arms. It took about 30 minutes for his arm to ascend the length of his body resting it so he was able to actually stop the command. His body groaning as it continued to expand. his head still soaring higher and higher. No use any way he continued to flex to release all the energy left in his body. His body shook and surprisingly he ascended even faster. This G-force caused him to black out only to wake up again. to a sight to behold.  The world was so small. He looked down seeing continents and little lights representing cities below him. Struggling with his own mass, he still felt hot all over bothered he continued to flex. Another short blackout later. He felt normal again. Seeing for miles around him his own flesh with the glow of the sky just beyond his own mass. trying to see beyond his own bulbous pecs he looked down to see the beautiful aurora borealis glow. squinting he saw the faint shimmering lights of the surface. He wasn&#39;t exactly sure what to think. He was so damn big. he realized neither his phone nor his computer had internet or data. Grumbling he tried to bend down searching for signal. Eventually finding the signal underneath is quads. He heard the calls of his director stating he saw Ben despite still being at the Mojave desert standing beyond the cloud line. Ben apologized for his abrupt growth spurt. The Director sighed by jovially stated &quot;Well don&#39;t worry I get to write even more ridiculous stories using your giant body as it is. Because your kinda hard to miss.&quot;, Ben blushed at that realization apologizing stating he will return to the Mojave. The Director and the rest of the crew eventually reshoot the scenes for the day despite how spacious each row of abs Ben have now been more than enough to place a small city in he felt obligated to complete the shot anyway. eventually logging back online his final results read: 80 miles (35,800,700,000,000 tons). Wow, he said in disbelief no wonder he saw the aurora. Looking up more stuff on the internet he saw a picture of the largest mountain in the Solar System. Wondering how big he was he looked. stunned to see it be a puny 16 miles high. He certainly can only be compared to distances measure horizontally at this point. he laughed as he suddenly realized that would make it so that his cock only was nearly as tall as the tallest mountain in the solar system. Stunned he decided to close his computer and rest for the night. <br />
Eventually, Ben filed his new height to the UN commissioner who came to observe the giant. The first news outlets showing video of him expanding all across the world. Eventually having the morning interviews with new anchors across America laughing about the latest growth burst, only to be seriously told that he was now not allowed to move in fear of causing a catastrophe if he does. The young broadcasting lady joked well you can&#39;t possibly be more than a couple billion pounds now big man. Ben uncomfortably laughed. The young lady suddenly croaked how heavy are you, sir. almost embarrassed Ben uttered he weighted closer to 35 trillion tons even underestimating his weight because he was so self-conscience of it. The Audience was stunned by that announcement. The Young women ran out of stage gasping as she was sensually overwhelmed. the cast of the newsroom decided to move on to other news thanking Ben for his time on air. Staring up at the sky he wondered whether he even had the right to be the only person in the world to be this big. He turned on Transformation.net. It looked back waiting for another command.</p>
