<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their late lunch, Martha Anderson started doing some housework while Mister Anderson went outside.<br />
Moon Lake was enjoying a wonderfully long &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. Whether that was because of global warming, climate change, or something else special about the town, William didn&#39;t know. But it was already the beginning of October, and he needed to make sure the house was ready for whatever the coming winter had in store. Besides, the rain gutters weren&#39;t going to clean themselves.<br />
William got out his ladder from the garage and began that task, not knowing that he was being watched.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Samantha and Frances Twist were treating their adoptive son Ben and his friend Nate Anderson to a late lunch at the local burger joint.<br />
Nate was really looking forward to his induction ceremony to join Ben&#39;s pack and becoming a werewolf later that night. Although he had already talked to the Twists about the problems concerning his parents from his perspective, there was one thing he had yet to discuss with the ladies.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gay,&quot; he said.<br />
Samantha and Frances looked at each other for a moment, and then turned to look at Nate. &quot;So?&quot; asked Samantha, while Frances resumed eating.<br />
&quot;I knew it wouldn&#39;t bother you two, being lesbians, but...&quot;<br />
&quot;Let me guess. You haven&#39;t told your parents yet,&quot; said Frances.<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; confirmed Nate.<br />
&quot;How many people do know?&quot; asked Samantha.<br />
&quot;Besides the three of you and my soon to be new Alpha, no one else in Moon Lake yet, although Austin is making arrangements for my... induction tonight,&quot; revealed Nate. &quot;There were a couple of friends back in Minnesota, but I never got far enough with anyone to...&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Frances, slipping into her professional therapist tone of voice. <i>He&#39;s still a virgin.</i> &quot;So your brother doesn&#39;t know either.&quot;<br />
Nate just shook his head affirmatively.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll save us both the time and not ask the ridiculous questions like, &#39;Are you sure?&#39;. Granted, it seems there is never a perfect time to tell someone something this important, but unfortunately now is not the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. My folk&#39;s marriage is in a perilous position as it is,&quot; agreed Nate. &quot;The last thing I need is for this to tip the scales the wrong way and initiate divorce proceedings. Dad could try to blame mom because she&#39;s bi, and I know it&#39;s not her fault or his. I just don&#39;t feel sexually attractive toward women the way other men do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Based upon what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s my professional opinion that you&#39;re comfortable with who you are, and I can reassure you right now that there are a lot of people in Moon Lake, weres and normals both, to who your personal preferences won&#39;t matter,&quot; said Frances. &quot;However, in light of recent events, I would strongly suggest that you stay in the proverbial closet as long as you can, at least around your family. Like you said, their marriage is in a delicate state right now, and none of you need the added stress.&quot;<br />
&quot;True, but when will be the right time to tell them?&quot; asked Nate. &quot;I should do so eventually.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed, but let&#39;s wait a while. However, if it does come up, don&#39;t lie to them either. Keep the lines of communication open with them either way. Just because you don&#39;t speak to them about this doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t talk to them at all. Otherwise, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the best advice I can give you,&quot; said Frances. &quot;Yet you know where to find me if you need me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Nate, before finishing his meal.<br />
<br />
William Anderson finished cleaning all the gutters on the front of the house.<br />
Moving the ladder around to the side of the house, he started cleaning those gutters out, while his watcher used a cellphone to call his superior.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Eric Anderson had set the alarm on his cellphone for 4pm. Dinner was usually around six, and the only thing he knew about Nate&#39;s ceremony into werewolf society was that it would begin sometime after dark.<br />
He had enjoyed the time with Julie. Eric liked having someone his own age as a friend to talk to and hang out with. Besides, there was something about the girl...<br />
<i>Her blonde hair? Her blue eyes? Her intelligence? The way the aquamarine of her scales shimmered in the water and the feeling of her tail brushing against my legs?</i><br />
Eric would be the first to admit he wasn&#39;t sure whether it was because or despite the fact that Julie revealed she was a were-merperson, or were-mermaid to be more specific. She was smart and liked a lot of the same things he did, although in some cases for different reasons. Julie could definitely hold her own in any conversation, and got him to change his mind on a couple of things during their afternoon together, especially weres.<br />
While he would probably always hate Yvette the werevixen for what she did to his father, it didn&#39;t bother Eric any more that most of the people he saw on his walk home might be weres. He even paused to either wave or say hello to a few of them on his way.<br />
<br />
As he approached the intersection where his street met the one he was on, Eric saw a large vehicle slowly drive past. While not a true limo, it looked capable of holding at least six people, maybe as many as nine.<br />
Eric looked both ways before crossing the street. Lost in more thoughts about Julie, he had passed the Twist house before noticing something odd. The big vehicle had stopped in front of his house and everyone was getting out.<br />
Eric stood on the sidewalk and watched as one man stayed with the vehicle. The rest had encircled this one person, like bodyguards, but all were walking toward the front door of his house.<br />
Everyone but the person in the middle was wearing dark suits. Whoever he or she was that they were escorting appeared to be dressed in red.<br />
As another man in a dark suit came out from somewhere across the street to join the one staying with their transportation, Eric started to reach for his cellphone when he heard a voice say, &quot;Hey Eric. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric turned and saw his brother getting out of the Twists&#39; car. Having paid so much attention to what was going on at their house, Eric had never heard them pull into their driveway.<br />
&quot;Something weird&#39;s going on at our house,&quot; said Eric, pointing down the sidewalk.<br />
With that announcement, everyone looked at the Anderson residence just a couple of doors down from the Twists.<br />
Then Samantha said to Frances, &quot;Honey, you better take the boys inside. It may be nothing, but I&#39;ll go check this out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Author&#39;s personal note: I&#39;m having a blast participating in the Moon Lake Saga, but someone more knowledgeable than myself will have to write the episode(s) covering Nate&#39;s actual induction ceremony into werewolf society.—tmw2015</p>
