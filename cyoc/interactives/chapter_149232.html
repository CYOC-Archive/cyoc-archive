<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">setting his phone back down as he went back to his computer when he got an idea from it that he quickly searched the site for what he was looking for, unaware Steve&#39;s human life was no longer his own any more. looking at his computer more that there were things like piercing, a butt plug to go up his scalely hind ass, even a dildo to play around with when he already had his very own cock to worry about as he clicked on something by accident. after he did, Steve was back into his own clothes that there was even a hole for your reptilian tail.<br />
<br />
feeling his arms is when Steve jumped off the chair while looking and examining his clothing that he was now wearing. &quot;What the? This is getting worse! I have to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
sitting back down that Steve was sitting right on your tail, but he didn&#39;t care about it while it slipped to the position between his legs. still looking for away to change his life back around that he soon found something about translation. &quot;what dose. . . translate &quot;marsh&quot;? what&#39;s translate &quot;marsh&quot;? maybe to translate this site into English.&quot;<br />
<br />
tapping it that Steve was unaware again on what was happening for his eyes sparked white. soon the sparks faded for his eyes as he wondered if it did anything at all, but when he took a quick glimpse of his marshland out from his window that he quickly looked back to his computer while blushing red from the site of his window for he now seemed to be loving the out doors more. &quot;am I speaking in marsh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but I don&#39;t know marsh! yet i&#39;m speaking it, yes?&quot; he said to himself while testing to see if he was actually speaking the language.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only know English!&quot; he argued to himself while feeling frustrated about it. looking around his room that he spotted his mirror as he wondered how to say what he was looking at in English, yet what came out was &quot;mohawk&quot; with a bit of confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;no that&#39;s not right.&quot; Steve said while looking back at his computer, though he did thought he looked awkward with the way he was dressed in his clothing. still looking around with his eyes now that a strange thought came to be while fearing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember!&quot; he said. looking around his room that he thought of giving this marsh language a try as he tried it out with the mirror first.<br />
<br />
&quot;mirror. bed. computer. door. top. lizard-mam.&quot; he said as this confirms that he was speaking marsh.<br />
<br />
he slapped his legs with scaled hands a couple o times in denial, but it only but shocks of erection into his thighs as his dick was showing a bit of a bulging grip in his pants. &quot;No! No...no...no! I am not a lizard-man! I am human! and this website had better fix this right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
scrolling through the page he was at that he soon clicked it. once done as he jumped a bit, his clothes were changed into a tuxedo outfit people wear at work. &quot;an outfit?&quot;<br />
<br />
he examined what he was wearing, while feeling anger at himself for trying this website. &quot;really?! ga, What can be worse then this? I totally look like a business man.&quot;<br />
<br />
his second attempt go go for it change his outfit into a black, latex, speedo swimming shorts. if Steve wasn&#39;t shock about this before, he sure was now as he almost literately let out a scream when he jumped. &quot;Ohhhhhhhh, no, no, no..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;this is really bad! I&#39;ve got to fix this!&quot; he said while figuring out on what to do with this that like always, the third times the charm as he was now wearing a heavy metal rock band outfit with black leather jeans, a leather jacket, it even came with an electric guitar hooked to a cord on your back.<br />
<br />
&quot;this is better. well that&#39;s a step closer in the right direction...&quot; Steve said as he toyed with his new outfit a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;but i&#39;m still not human!&quot; to some that they would be happy about the outfit and walk away, but not him as he clicked yet one more time to be in a loincloth with some tribal strap bands on his arms, legs, and even his tail. now he was getting annoyed by this strange outfit change that was going on here.<br />
<br />
&quot;ga, Not this again?!&quot; Steve said. frustrated even more that he got off his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;At this rate i&#39;ll end up dressed like a cosplay character next.&quot; sighing with not taking this anymore that he sits back down on his chair, this time to move his tail out of the way. unaware for him that this would be his last time to sit off of the chair, while seeing his computer and finding his way out of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;What other choices do I have on this site?&quot; he said while scrolling the webpage. soon though, his eyes light up with hope when something caught his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this? Upgrade your temporary membership to a FULL lifetime membership...&quot; he said while reading it out loud for it was about Terms and Conditions. &quot;...to enjoy all the benefits of this site.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; he said while sounding happy about something. &quot;Once I have full membership that I can undo all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TERMS. bla..bla..bla..bla.&quot; reading the terms while skipping a bunch of paragraphs on the page that when it came up on do you agree to these terms is where you were hoping it will accept and turn you human again.<br />
<br />
&quot;do I agree? yes...pleace.&quot; was all you said for you quickly pressed the enter key, but as you did this is when you were blinded a bright light from the screen that you quickly covered your eyes from it while feeling a strange pull.<br />
<br />
the light was so bright now that it was like it was pulling you into the screen as you black out from the computer screen. And suddenly, he found himself outside of the marshlands. his basically out cold, but at least he in a nice warm hut when he started to stir.<br />
<br />
Steve later came for it was like getting hit by something hard on the head as his vision was soon clear. seeing as he was in some kind of homemade hut that the roof was made of straw, the walls on all sides were stacked side by side of bamboo looking like wood with some cloth hanging over them as the floor itself was just straw. thankfully Steve was on a man made bed with a white pillow, some blankets, even a comforter to lay your back on that he started to freak out.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah..., Damn! what happened?... Wait, what’s going on here? Oh shit! where am I? what am I doing here? I need to get out of...&quot; panicing as he said this that he quickly spotted a two cloth door way with some light seeping out and ran for it, but once he did is where he found himself in the middle of the marshlands.<br />
<br />
wondering as to how he got there that his glimpse caught his retraction from the water as he was still a lizard-man, wearing a tribal outfit from before. Steve Eventually did find something was wrong here as he noticed some other huts near by, while collapsing to his knees in defeat and suffering. he wasn&#39;t alone here ether as there were other lizard-man and woman of different age and colors that one was wearing feathers over his head while thinking he&#39;s the chief here.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, it&#39;s official. not even My own family would recognize me now. not even they would know that this is me now, but dose everyone else here even know it&#39;s really me? if so, then who&#39;s life did I change with?&quot; Steve said to himself as he looked up to the nice warm sun that was shining so bright on his reptilian body.<br />
<br />
a thought came to be as to who he was called now while also thinking about home. if he was here in this anthro lizard body, then who was in his? these and more were popping up in his head when he thought someone was calling out to him as everyone here was talking &quot;marsh&quot;.<br />
<br />
all he knew was that his old life was over, as this was his new life now. he was basically reincarnated into a lizard-man to start a new life, while remembering his old life style. what to do next?</p>
