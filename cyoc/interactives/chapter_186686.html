<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kari grimaced, launching a series of spells as she barked orders. &quot;Kiko, Chisai, get the survivors inside!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko, Kari&#39;s seven tailed sister, scowled as she now stood shoulder to shoulder with her nine tailed sister. &quot;If you think I&#39;m going to cower in the palace like some weak willed geisha you got another thing coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari now glanced at her sister, noticing the fuscha colored kitsune mumble a spell as she clapped her hands together. At first unsure what she was doing she jumped in shock as bolts of lightning now rained down from the heavens, sending Normal soldiers sailing into the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko sighed heavily, glancing at her sister with tired eyes. &quot;Moms been giving me lessons for years but it takes alot out of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea you could do that,&quot; Kari stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one more trick up my sleeve,&quot; Kiko grunted. &quot;But I need time and the survivors would be vulnerable to attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hold them at bay Kiko but you would be vulnerable,&quot; Yuriko stated. &quot;I fear they may try to strike you down if I attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I guess its a good thing I showed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko, Kari, and Yuriko turned, shocked to see who had arrived in their hour if need. &quot;Kenta!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tanuki smirked, giving his former kitsune girlfriend a coy look. &quot;Heard you could use some help babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko turned as close to a hundred tanuki filed in behind Kenta. The tanuki lord now barking orders at his men. &quot;Protect the survivors!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tanuki nodded, reaching down as they now pulled forth shields from their own bodies. Yuriko had always been a bit embarrassed by the tanukis lack of modesty, useing their own genitals to forge items, however in this case she could not be more thankful. A phalanx of tanuki shield bearers now stood in front of Kiko, completely blocking the kitsune from fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Kenta,&quot; Kiko smirked. &quot;Yuriko can you handle the rest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko gazed at the platoon of soldiers now taking positions. &quot;I believe so,&quot; she stated. &quot;But I fear their are more out there than we realize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry I brought backup with me,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari and Kiko now gave Kenta a bemused look as the tanuki pointed upwards. The kitsunes eyes going wide as close to a dozen dragons now swooped from the skies, their dragon fire incinerating the visible Normal. Kari immediately recognized the lead dragons as they landed. &quot;Tricia! Matt!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia, the Dragon Queen, and her husband Matt smiled, baring their huge teeth to the nine tailed kitsune. Tricia now began to shift into human form. The monstrous purple dragon shrinking down into human proportions while her scales became flesh and wings vanished. &quot;Couldn&#39;t lose another friend Kari,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As touching as this reunion is,&quot; Matt stated. &quot;We still have work to do.&quot; Kari and Tricia nodded in agreement. Gazing out they could see that while the Dragons and Tanuki had turned the tide for the moment, the Normal were prepared.<br />
<br />
Yuriko and Hannah watched as the Normal retreated, regrouping, preparing a counter strike. Yuriko bit her lip nervously, she already had a bad feeling.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it appeared the elderly wizards instincts were accurate as she watched a sniper fire at one of the dragons. Shocked, she watched as the blast tore through the chest of a young blue dragon, its death cries echoing through the city as it crashed to the ground.<br />
<br />
Yuriko roared in anger, she had seen too much death already. &quot;Kitsunes, Dragons,&quot; she growled. &quot;They&#39;ve been family to me for as long as I can remember! I have had enough of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a primal scream, the elderly wizard screamed reaching out with her psionic abilities. Hannah watched, unnerved as the wizards abilities crushed pavement, buildings, and bodies. Wincing she watched as Yuriko crushed soldiers useing her mind before tossing their mangled corpses away. &quot;Hannah,&quot; she bellowed.<br />
<br />
Hannah shook herself out of her stupor, fearfully gazing at the enraged wizard. &quot;Take out the sniper in that tower! I&#39;ll clear a path.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah nodded, the gynoid teen readying herself as Yuriko now systematically begin crushing  soldiers with her mind. Hannah knew that the wizard was powerful, she just didn&#39;t know she could be so ruthless. Thinking back to all the times her and Steph had questioned her Hannah could appreciate the womans patience. For now though she had a job to do.<br />
<br />
Hannah was amazed at not only her speed but her agility. Climbing over walls, up buildings, and leaping between various objects, Hannah quickly made her way to the snipers position. Spitting the sniper she now lept at him, useing her foot to grab his face before slamming him to the ground and knocking him unconscious.<br />
<br />
Yuriko smirked, Hannah certainly knew how to take care of herself. With the sniper safely neutralized, Yuriko now went about providing support. Useing her powers to disarm and even freeze the bullets in midair, she turned towards Kari, Tricia, and Kiko. &quot;Anytime now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everybody get back,&quot; Kiko yelled. Thw others now withdrew behind Kiko as the seven tailed kitsune drew a series of symbols in the air. The ground now cracking open in front if them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiko what is that,&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets just say some old friends of our want to say hi to the Normal,&quot; Kiko smiled.<br />
<br />
The Normal paused as the chasm opened in front of them. Why would the kitsune open up a hole in the ground? That question was answered as an unearthly growl emanated from the hole. Sloqly but surely the Normal could see creatures pull themselves from the earth. Creatures the Normal though they had exterminated decades ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves!&quot;<br />
<br />
Panic and fear spread like wildfire as the Normal tried to counter the undead lycans barreling down on their postion. The corpses of the Lycans, wiped out by the Normal, now found themselves seeking revenge. Their ghastly howls the only thing heard as they tore through the ranks of the Normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;How,&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Secret,&quot; Kiko smirked. &quot;But they have to work fast. I can only keep them on this plane of existence for so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
**********************************<br />
<br />
Mizuki sobbed as her brother Ito now tried to calm her. The two one tails had only barely gotten away from the Normal. &quot;Wheres mommy,&quot; Mizuki cried.<br />
<br />
Ito glanced down at his younger sister. By kitsune standards Mizuki was 5 years old while her older brother was only 8. &quot;Shes coming,&quot; Ito whispered. &quot;We just have to be very quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ito watched his sister nod, wiping her tears as he took her hand. He didn&#39;t have the heart to tell her their parents were dead. He had seen it himself, soldiers burst into their home, killing their father before he had time to act. The last words his mother said as she helped his sister through the window was run. As the kits rounded a corner they screamed in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ito pushed his sister behind him, telling her to close her eyes. They would be joining their parents soon.<br />
<br />
Or so they thought.<br />
<br />
Ito&#39;s eyes went wide as a woman in a blue veil slashed the throat of one of the soldiers. Ito couldnt be sure but he thought she was an elf, but elves never left their homeland. What shocked him more was the dark orange nine tailed kitaune that now grasped the remaining soldier by the neck. At first Ito thought the nine tailed kitsune was Lord Tatsu but Tatsu was gold not orange..<br />
<br />
Fukushu now snapped the neck of the soldier flinging the corpses of the Normal into the burning rubble. Turning towards the thw two frightened kits, Fukushu now tried to not frightened the already scared kits. &quot;Head to the palace children,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;You will be safe there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now watched as the two kits sprinted towards the palace. Gritting his teeth, he clenched his fist in rage. Slaughtering children. Yes Fukushu had done things just as awful but these were his people, his clan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come Abolith,&quot; he stated. &quot;We finish this fight that THEY started.&quot;</p>
