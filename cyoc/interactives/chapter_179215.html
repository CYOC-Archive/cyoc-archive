<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I’m back from an incredibly long hiatus! <br/>
While I was taking a bit of a break from writing, I was thinking about what kind of transformations I wanted to try, and for some reason, merman was really damn close to the top. So, I figured I’d try something a little different for my return! I’ll be working on the next part and it should be ready in the next few days.  Hope you all enjoy! <br/>
-TWP</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Alex stared at the two signs, contemplating his options, he noticed the wooden finish of another sign peeking out from a large bush in front of the sign.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, must&#39;ve fallen off,” Alex said to himself before kneeling down and pulling the sign out of the bush. Like the other two, this sign was in the shape of a dick. Written on the sign were the words “Clum Hump Lake Mermen”. Judging by the way the words were written on the sign, it seemed like it had been pointing down the path on the right in the direction of the Prickin Nole Forest Elves. <br />
<br />
“Mermen, huh?” Alex said to himself. “Sounds interesting. I guess I should check it out.” Propping the sign up against the bush, Alex began walking down the right path towards Clum Hump Lake. <br />
<br />
The walk to Clum Hump Lake was uneventful. In fact, it was rather peaceful. The whole time, Alex was wondering what the mermen were like. Would they be welcoming of a stranger, especially a human, wandering into their lake? Why did the sign say “Mermen” and not “Merfolk”? Was the lake entirely filled with mermen? Alex’s mind was buzzing with questions about the lake and its inhabitants, but he was soon snapped out of his thoughts by a faint sound in the distance. It definitely wasn’t an animal...it was singing.<br />
<br />
Alex stopped walking and listened quietly. Someone was definitely singing nearby, though not so much with words. It sounded like they were exploring the range of their voice. It was beautiful, and clearly male. As Alex started walking down the path once again, the singing began to grow louder. He was getting closer to the owner of the beautiful voice. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long until Alex could see the lake at the end of the path. Eagerly, the young male began to jog towards his destination, the beautiful singing drawing him closer and closer, until he eventually stopped on the sandy shoreline of Clum Hump Lake.<br />
<br />
Despite its rather strange name, the lake was stunningly beautiful. The entire massive lake was surrounded by trees, which stopped where the miniature beach began. Nearby was a large cliff with a waterfall flowing into the lake and a rather large alcove. However, this wasn’t what had Alex’s attention. <br />
<br />
On a large rock in the middle of the sat a lean, fair skinned young man that looked to be about his age. His hair was a messy mop of wavy texture in a gorgeous shade of golden blonde. It reminded Alex of the type of hairstyle a lifeguard or surfer would have. His face was incredibly handsome, with a soft chin and defined cheekbones, and his chest was very well defined, as evidenced by his pert nipples and his washboard abs. However, the most notable thing about him was his lower body. Instead of legs, the young man had a beautiful tail with seafoam green scales that shone in the moonlight. <br />
<br />
Alex had been so entranced by the young merman’s singing that he didn’t notice himself walking closer to the alcove where the merman was singing. It wasn’t until Alex was about 15 feet away that the merman’s green eyes met Alex’s blue ones. Alex froze, and the young merman stopped singing, the two staring at each other in silence. <br />
<br />
Finally, the merman broke the awkward silence.  “I wasn’t aware that I had an audience,” he said with a nervous chuckle. “And a human one at that…”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude,” Alex said. “I heard your singing and I just had to find the source. You have an incredible voice.” <br />
<br />
The merman blushed and looked away, scratching the back of his head nervously. “Oh...I wouldn’t say it’s incredible,” he said timidly. “My brothers have much better voices than I do.”<br />
<br />
“No, really! Your voice is beautiful!” Alex responded. “I’ve never heard a voice as melodic as yours!”<br />
<br />
The merman chuckled before sliding off the rock and into the water, making a decent sized splash that got Alex a bit wet. A second later, the young merman’s head popped above the water and he swam closer to the shore. Alex felt an overwhelming desire to meet him halfway, and began to walk into the water without hesitation. He cautiously placed a foot in the water, testing the temperature. The water was rather warm and inviting, almost calling him to come further in. Letting go of his inhibitions, Alex progressed further into the lake, stopping when the water was up to his nipples. The merman swam up to him, stopping about a foot away. <br />
<br />
“It’s not often I see a human around these parts,” the merman said, giving Alex a soft smile. “Especially one who isn’t wearing any clothes.”<br />
<br />
Alex chuckled nervously. “Oh yeah...it’s a long story,” he said. “I’m Alex, by the way.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Tide,” the merman responded. “It’s nice to have a name to put with the handsome face I’m looking at.”<br />
<br />
Now it was Alex’s turn to be embarrassed, turning his head away to hide his blush. What were the odds that Tide was flirting with him? First there were those two gay werewolves, then those weird, dick-shaped signs, and now this! Just where exactly was he? <br />
<br />
Alex was snapped out of his thoughts by Tide placing a hand on his shoulder, bringing the human’s attention back to the merman in front of him. The two stared deep into each other’s eyes, both of them feeling the same feeling of longing. Then, without warning, Tide leaned in and pressed his lips against Alex’s, pulling the human’s body close. <br />
<br />
Alex was caught off guard by the merman’s sudden advance. A small part of his mind was yelling at him to push Tide off of him, but it was quickly silenced as Tide pushed his tongue into Alex’s mouth. The young man responded by doing the same, their tongues slipping and wrestling with each other. Alex wrapped his hands around Tide, holding the merman close as the two of them kissed for what felt like an eternity. When Alex finally broke the kiss, gasping for air, he took a moment to process what had just happened. <br />
<br />
“Wow…” he said, running his fingers through Tide’s wavy blonde hair. “I never imagined my first kiss would be…” <br />
<br />
“...with a merman?” Tide finished, cupping Alex’s cheek in his hand. The merman moved a bit closer and Alex felt something long, firm, and slick against his stomach. He looked down and saw a long, firm shaft that was pinkish-purple in color and honed to a tip extending out of a thick, rubbery slit in Tide’s seafoam green scales. Alex was awestruck by the sight of this merman’s massive length, estimating that it had to be at least 10 inches. <br />
<br />
“I had no idea that mermen were so...well endowed,” Alex said, staring in fascination at Tide’s cock. This earned a laugh from Tide. <br />
<br />
“Do they not teach you about the dicks of other creatures in school?” the merman asked. “You humans are strange.” <br />
<br />
Alex was confused by this comment. “Uh, we never learned about other kinds of dicks,” the young man said. “We learned about how sex between a male and a female works, and that was about it.”<br />
<br />
Now it was Tide’s turn to be confused. “Fee...male?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, female,” Alex reiterated, looking at Tide’s confused face. “You know, women? Girls? They don’t have penises, and they have breasts.” The young man tried to demonstrate breasts by cupping his hands in front of his chest, but this didn’t make Tide any less confused. <br />
<br />
“I’ve...never heard of such creatures,” Tide said. “A creature without a penis sounds like something out of a fairy tale.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry to confuse you,” Alex apologized. “You see, I’m...not from around here.”<br />
<br />
Tide gave Alex a warm smile, wrapping his arms around the human’s shoulders and pulling the two of them together, with the only thing between them being Tide’s erect cock. <br />
<br />
“I don’t care where you’re from,” the merman said. “All I know is that we belong together.<br />
<br />
Alex was flattered. Was this merman that he had only just met ten minutes ago already professing his love? Did romance somehow move faster in this world? As much as Alex wanted to say yes though, he knew he couldn’t. <br />
<br />
“I...I’m sorry Tide, but I don’t know if something between us would work,” Alex said softly. “I mean, I’m a human and you’re a merman.” Tide looked disappointed for a second before a smile returned to his face. <br />
<br />
“Then don’t be human,” he said. Alex looked at the merman in confusion. <br />
<br />
“What...what do you mean?” Alex asked, which earned another smile from Tide. <br />
<br />
“I like you, Alex. We’re kindred spirits, you and I. Haven&#39;t you ever longed to be something other than a human? Be a merman, like me. Then we can be together...as lovers.”<br />
<br />
Alex was at a loss for words. Was Tide really offering to turn him into a merman so the two of them could be together? It sounded too good to be true, and yet, the young man believed every word that Tide said.</p>
