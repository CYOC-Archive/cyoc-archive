<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey mom!&quot; Mary asked her mother, &quot;Where do you think Ulysses and his family moved to?<br />
&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
The barely teenage girl replied, &quot;One of my class mates, he kinda cute for a boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't remember him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird, I could have sworn I mentioned him once to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dear I don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Mary shrugged, &quot;I hope wherever he is he's happy.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
In the male den away from where Sarah carried Ulysses in the back yard, and away from <br />
Zackery's 'throne room' in the room on the second floor facing the front yard where the <br />
construction was going on, Zackery and Roger sat with each other. Nick was with Nicole, <br />
apparently Nick was none too happy that Nicole had failed to inform him that magic had <br />
been chosen to be used to upgrade his fellow males opposed to hard work he had been <br />
looking for basic instructions for.  All of the pack steered clear of the two as they had their <br />
'discussion.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery sure has changed.&quot; Lawrence commented. &quot;Before he treated us as surplus, now <br />
he's totally polite with us and treats as equals, maybe more than that, like we belong to <br />
the same class of males as he and Nick do!&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger said sitting on the coach that acted like a large chair to the male big bad wolf, &quot;Or <br />
maybe it's us that's changed.  He thought we were extra because we weren't titans like <br />
him. If he wanted no other males around besides Master he wouldn't have been friendly <br />
with Nick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence thought in a cultured pose, &quot;Hmmm, maybe he realized Nick was his only real <br />
opposition and wanted to be on friendly terms with him, and now wants to be on friendly <br />
terms with us? In other words he respects our power now, he respects our strength, he <br />
respects us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haven't you noticed that we're also respecting him now too? Like it was nothing before?&quot; <br />
The pastel green Roger honestly wouldn't have given any of this a first thought if not for <br />
the pastel green Megan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Respect begets respect.&quot; Lawrence said simply. &quot;And he is a fine and proper man wolf <br />
titan like we are now. We are what the females want, and we have what we can give them. <br />
We are beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Roger thought, &quot;Have you see the entranced look the she-wolves get near us <br />
now? It's like our scent puts them in another world almost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren't complaining, they aren't being harmed, they're enjoying us more because of <br />
us, and it isn't subverting Master's authority for they'd all still mate with Master in a heart <br />
beat if he wished it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that he seems to -care- to mate with any besides the Alpha and Betas it seems for <br />
now. And well... you get the feeling like we've become -more- like -Zack- somehow?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least. We're simply as hansom as him now, we're as good with the females as <br />
him now, we're as powerful as him now, we're as great as he is now, we're as mighty as he <br />
is now. Nothing more.&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger couldn't argue with that, but he felt like there was something wrong with that <br />
statement. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
The dynamic in the game had changed, and now Pearl was the one who wanted out of the <br />
game while Megan, June and Beatrice were the ones who wanted to keep playing.  Pearl <br />
kept trying to produce good excuses to leave, but June kept holding here her with a <br />
sublime grasp underneath the table. <br />
<br />
Pearl just hoped June didn't do something insane like try and Dare Megan and Beatrice into <br />
having no negative thoughts about Zackery... this would then turn into absolute insanity... <br />
ugh, and all of this wasn't helping her hangover at all. <br />
<br />
'On the bright side, the Master seems to be about done with recruiting new members. As <br />
soon as the last handful are added, we won't even -need- the game anymore unless <br />
someone barges in here to cause us trouble... So there's no need to worry about me using <br />
a turn being discovered. ... ' Pearl sighed, 'The pack is our family now, and the estate and <br />
whatever territories Master Bart and Master Jenny manage to get is our world.  I just hope <br />
we don't become like one of those communes that proves unable to support itself...' <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat's the last of de paper work.&quot; Jenny said writing down the document in perfect hand <br />
writing that matched her adult self flawlessly. <br />
<br />
Bart sitting on the other end of the desk nodded finnish his pile, &quot;Ditto her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin perked, &quot;Caterpie!&quot; Marcy added, &quot;Sandshrew!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two older pups looks at them confused. <br />
<br />
Marcy explained, &quot;Play pokemon like... Mother did before she became mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two pups looked at each other and shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;So everything is set with the shadows.&quot; Jenny said, &quot;They'll be able to function as our <br />
avatars in any business dealing with no hassle. And each are armed with a Turn in the <br />
game if pushed into an extreme situation.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And no one will question the paper work that says your three shadows were always <br />
female. Luckily none of them had relatives in Glendale and their own relatives aren't likely <br />
to check the records to something they themselves know to be different.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Jenny nodded. &quot;As soon as the gate is complete, we send our shadows out into <br />
the world, and they'll be our hands for insuring the estate stays legally and economically <br />
stable. No one's coming to repossess OUR home!&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha came up to the two hugged them with an arm set each, &quot;I'm so proud of both you, <br />
as I know your parents are proud of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy of course were jealous as siblings will be, but they weren't about to cause <br />
trouble over it. &quot;Awww, we wanna  hug too.&quot; Not much. <br />
<br />
Taking the two older pups in one muscular arm each, Martha then used her lower arms to <br />
hug the two younger pups, her left head nuzzling them while her tails tickled them <br />
making them giggle. <br />
<br />
Mr. P joined in the group hug rubbing his sides against the pups and Martha. Yes. This <br />
was good. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Julie thought as she finished dressing.  Her daughters hadn't been able to write like this <br />
before, meaning logically it had to be written by Alice or someone else... but, it was their <br />
choice of words, and their style of speaking... had Alice written the note FOR them then?  <br />
Julie cursed herself for not learning more about Alice when she had a chance, then she'd <br />
know what kind of horrid revolting unnatural -thing- now had her babies! She'd make it <br />
pay! She'd make it pay dearly! <br />
<br />
Julie thought some more, the letter had precisely stated not to have Madam Serenity or <br />
anyone else -there- -with- her. Thinking that, Julie made a phone call. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Madam Serenity it's me. My daughters are gone. Yes all the mirrors were covered <br />
up!!! I heard our dog barking and when I came out they were gone along with Chester. I <br />
thought they were playing a game but I found a note signed with their names to come <br />
back to Glendale alone.   No. No I'm not picking you up. Yes they gave me a location, but <br />
it's not one I'm going to give you.  Why? Because the message said to come alone! I'm not <br />
putting my daughters in danger! Any danger!  I still have the ear phones you gave me to <br />
block out sounds if it really is the game. .. Thank you for your help Madam Serenity, and I <br />
felt it was just right for me thank you for everything you've done. NO! I said I'm not telling <br />
you where! You'd come too! And that would endanger my babies! That's final!  If anything <br />
happens to me, please save my husband and children, please. That is all. Good-bye.&quot; Julie <br />
hung up the phone as Madam Serenity still shouting on the line.  She began packing up her <br />
daughters' things and her own to begin the drive back to Glendale, the message hadn't <br />
given a time limit, so she had no idea when she was supposed to be there... so she <br />
assumed as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Back in Glendale, &quot;Mrs. Butler! Mrs. Butler! PLEASE! If they have your daughters then they're <br />
likely already transformed! Don't go! Mrs. Butler!.... dammit...&quot; Madam Serenity cursed as <br />
she realized Mrs. Butler had hung up on her. &quot;Dammit... she's doomed... I only hope <br />
Trevor finds something we can use to find this new harem.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity thought, she knew Trevor's fear of not being able to speak with her would <br />
make it impossible to see her as a friend, but she still enjoyed his company... she had <br />
been working solo for so long that it was rather pleasing to finally have someone to work <br />
along side, to share her secrets with, to share their duty she had given herself of somehow <br />
ending the game and saving it's victims.  Sometimes Serenity wondered if the game <br />
COULD be ended, and if all the turns were terminated, a new one would manifest in <br />
particularly petty and spiteful person to start the cycle anew? She didn't know, and that <br />
was why she had to try. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come back safe Trevor, and find out what we need to know, you're the Butler family's last <br />
hope.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Samantha and Abbey, if not for the overwhelming desire to finally see their father again, <br />
would have voiced their desire to explore every inch of the mirrorverse. They were amazed <br />
at what they saw. The reflections of people walking around going through them like they <br />
were ghosts. The way the stuff that was in view of the reflective surface was a flip around <br />
of the outside world, and the way the stuff that had once been in view of a mirror was <br />
now looking almost frozen in time until they interacted with it, and the stuff that had <br />
NEVER been in view of a reflective surface was completely and utterly different! <br />
<br />
Abbey actually found a record play dating back to the 1930s and some records along side <br />
it in the corner of the room!  The closet looked like someone had drawn it but had <br />
completely forgotten the rules of geometry... but Abbey felt no fear. There was no need. <br />
An inner voice, an instinct spoke to her, this was her world, her place, it would not harm <br />
it's own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come now,&quot; Alice said to her cousins/half-sisters, &quot;We have to go and meet your father <br />
before auntie gets there before us and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just three step?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just three steps. I know where we're going so let me lead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey and Samantha obediently nodded. Chester wondered to Fenrir what was going to <br />
happen next! <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, follow my lead, one,&quot; Alice took one step, &quot;Two,&quot; The second step, and all the <br />
world around them was in a blur, &quot;Three!&quot; <br />
<br />
They were standing in a big mansion. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; Samantha did declare. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; Abbey added. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHat-that-the!&quot; Chester the little dog gasped in confusion and declared. <br />
<br />
Alice looked at her cousins/half-sisters and their pet, and was mentally overwhelmed with <br />
the questions that flooded her mind. <br />
<br />
'The message Abbey and Samantha wrote at the house was done in pictures. This message <br />
was written down in plain english.  However they are using contractions when I most <br />
decidedly do not do. Curious.  and curiouser. They are now identical twins rather than <br />
fraternal twins but don't act like two sides of a mirror like mother and Auntie do. <br />
Curiouser.  Chester is decidedly NOT part of the Big Bad Wolf Pack, yet he didn't become <br />
like me when he entered... was that because they brought him into the mirror world, or <br />
because he's a dog, or because he's not human? Curiouser and Curiouser. Can we <br />
understand Chester because we are now wolves or because this is the world within <br />
mirrors? Curiouser and Curiouser.  And Samantha thinks of her mother now as he aunt but <br />
still refers to auntie Fran as her mother most curious indeed!' <br />
<br />
Chester wasn't wearing any victorian era pet attire either, Alice guessed that was because <br />
he wasn't related in any way to Alice unlike her mother, aunt and cousins. Alice giggled <br />
wonder what sort of clothes would appear on Jensen within the mirror world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at them all.&quot; Abbey said seeing all the ghostly reflections of all the she wolves <br />
around them, Master had mirrors set up in almost every room for Alice to easily move <br />
about the household. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're naked.&quot; Samantha said simply, not really alarmed or confused, just making an <br />
observation. <br />
<br />
&quot;So are we in the world outside this world.&quot; Alice said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Abbey said thinking about how her body had turned to glass outside the mirror <br />
before.  &quot;Alice, why didn't you say you turned to glass outside the mirror and we would <br />
too?&quot; There was no accusation in her voice or anger, only innocent and pure curiosity. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was worried that you would not want to be with me in here. I do not mind being glass <br />
outside the mirror. But it is gravely lonely being the only person who is real inside this <br />
universe.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abbey and Samantha hugged Alice at once, &quot;You're not alone anymore.&quot; &quot;You've got us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know... thank you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha then pulled on Alice's tail causing a yip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow! What was that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For thinking we wouldn't come along with you over a nonsense thing like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Alice then smiled and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where they all human?&quot; Abbey asked gesturing at all the she-wolf reflections around <br />
them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Every last one.&quot; Alice nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;So many,&quot; Chester said, &quot;All of them blessed by Fenrir so utterly and completely. Unlike <br />
that crazy girl I saw who got cursed by Bast or something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it is the Game,&quot; Alice said, &quot;The magic of Glendale that let anyone become <br />
anything if asked properly first. Though I feel the same has some rather unfair bylaws, but <br />
no use complaining about what can not change, and if one can do something about <br />
something they should do it instead of wasting time complaining about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey and Samantha looked at each other, then Alice and nodded. Chester's little brain <br />
spun in circles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where's daddy?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right this way, I know where they'll be, come along.&quot; Alice took hold of her cousins again, <br />
&quot;One, two, three.&quot; In the same blur of three steps (which wasn't any longer or shorter than <br />
before), they were in a new room and saw two large identical dirty blond she wolves with <br />
impressive chests next to a larger reddish brown she wolf with a small chest, and finally <br />
one big and bad black wood who the girls easily realized was male. They actually blushed <br />
and turned away at the sight. They were as naked as all the she wolves they had seen <br />
were. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now don't be she,&quot; Alice took her hands, and stepped out of the mirror, becoming a <br />
naked humanoid glass wolf child with two smaller identical ones behind her. Chester in <br />
Samantha's arms remaining the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mother! We're back!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We?&quot; Darla and Fran asked turning as one to the sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Abbey, Samatha, meet your daddy, now your new mama.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama?&quot; The two identical girls asked in confusion. <br />
<br />
Dead silence. The red and black wolves in the room remain totally silent and just <br />
observed. Fran's eyes began to mist up, and thus so did Darla's. <br />
<br />
Finally Fran couldn't hold it back anymore and charged at the two glass girls, Alice <br />
stepping out of the way and Chester leaping out of Samantha's arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;MY GIRLS!&quot; Fran hugged them both tightly kneeling down, her breasts like giant pillows <br />
against her bodies. &quot;I missed you so much! So much! I'm, I'm I'm, I'M JUST SO HAPPY TO <br />
SEE YOU! I kept getting scared this day would never come! I kept being worried! I'm just so <br />
happy to see you as part of our new family as last!&quot; Fran practically broken down in tears, <br />
as did Darla thought keeping some distance. <br />
<br />
&quot;New family?&quot; Abbey asked, her head and Samantha's swimming at this giant wolf woman <br />
who hugged them calling them her children and... it felt totally and completely and utterly <br />
RIGHT!<br />
<br />
Alice nodded, Fran too chock up from happiness to speak, &quot;I am your cousin and half <br />
sister. You also now have two more half sisters and two half brothers. My mother is your <br />
aunt and the twin of your new mother. When aunt Julie becomes part of the pack, she will <br />
be the mom of Abbey, while Aunt Fran is now the mom of Samantha! I guess that makes <br />
Alpha Female your step mom, but do not worry, she is nice enough.&quot; She gestured at <br />
Jensen, &quot;And this is our father, your new father, and my father. Alpha Male, Master, Big <br />
Bad Wolf Jensen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen calmly observed the two new glass wolf girls. They were easily the youngest of all <br />
the ones who had been created, even if it was only indirectly by the game, and the two of <br />
them were living unbreakable glass like Alice.  And... he found himself thinking about how <br />
so utterly adorable they were! And he felt proud at that they WERE his daughters... which <br />
sent his head swimming at how it wasn't like the sweet nectar of dominance he was used <br />
to feeding off of from his transformed victims, here instead, he honestly felt it like it was <br />
HIS honor to be THEIR parent, the alien thoughts and emotions made him feel weird, he <br />
had decidedly felt this with Bart and all the others, but these two filled the glass over the <br />
top and now it spilled over leaving Jensen feeling odd.  <br />
<br />
Finally Jensen said, &quot;I... I hope you find your new lives in the pack to be very happy ones.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked at Master completely shocked and somewhat a little alarmed at his tone and <br />
expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thank you...&quot; Samantha stutter, &quot;Daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. He is your daddy, and I am your mommy, forever and always now.&quot; Fran whispered <br />
hugging her daughter. <br />
<br />
Darla meanwhile to expression her own copy of Fran's emotions came up behind Alice <br />
hugged her own child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any regrets being my child Alice? Any at all? Even without the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
'No Mother, I promise, none at all. ... Do you regret having a glass daughter? Even if not <br />
for the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have never ever chosen this life if asked.&quot; Darla answered honestly to her child, <br />
&quot;But now with you, my sister, my nieces and Master, I wouldn't trade it for a kingdom.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice peacefully leaned against her mother, &quot;Thank you... mama...&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Trevor groaned as his trail had led him straight to a dentist office. It included a little boy <br />
wearing fake wolf ears and was there apparently for a second set of fillings. Trevor <br />
groaned again. He couldn't get in the old fashioned way, but could see plenty from the <br />
glass window and door that made up the entirety of the office's front side.  He circled the <br />
place a few times. Not picking up anything more than a wavering scent. 'Looks like I went <br />
in the totally wrong direction... so the wolves are coming out to take care of medical <br />
matters? Who'd have thought... this means they're not completely beast things then, then <br />
again they'd need speech and thinking to use the game anyway...' <br />
<br />
Trevor however picked up a second trail of scents, identical to the first, yep, these were <br />
the same two wolves... Trevor began to follow the second trail hoping it would lead him to <br />
the wolves... after that... who knew what would happen.  'Here's hoping to God in Heaven I <br />
don't get eaten...'</p>
