<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So you&#39;d been turned into a cat girl maid, seen a guy turned into a cat girl maid, had your personality rewritten several times as part of your job, just found out a friend of yours was now working at a rival transformation zapping cafe, got into a fight with a fox woman, AND found out your mother could change into a super powered little girl and kept hoping you&#39;d become a super powered little girl too, and now that you&#39;d become a cat girl maid, you&#39;d failed to live up to her hopes and dreams. <br />
<br />
All this happening in the span of one day was overwhelming, you imagined it was the magic of your contract that was keeping you from going stark raving mad at all these revelations. <br />
<br />
It was Tuesday, and the second day of work. Was actually less crazy was how Phyllis had actually asked to sleep over like they were a couple of teenage girls. But given everything else... you just went along with it. At least mom didn&#39;t seem to mind. <br />
<br />
... You had failed your mother, not able to live up to what she&#39;d secretly wanted for you for decades... As a daughter, and as a proper cat girl maid you felt awful, yeah, you were pretty sure the mental enchantments were actually keeping you sane. <br />
<br />
What would your father think? Late that night, you&#39;d asked, <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, does dad know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he does, oh,&quot; She looked at your cat ears and tail. &quot;You mean about me being a Magical Girl? Very much yes! I didn&#39;t want to marry him and keep that from him. I figured that if I kept it from him, he&#39;d find out in a way that I didn&#39;t have control over. He was just relieved I wasn&#39;t part of a cult or something! ... And no, I haven&#39;t called him and told him about... what happened... I imagine that if this enchantment works the way it was supposed to, he may or may not even notice your change... I&#39;ll leave it for you to tell him.&quot; <br />
<br />
You were happy that dad was out of town that night, but that wasn&#39;t going to last very long <i>AT ALL...</i>. <br />
<br />
You mother was upset enough at your new career move. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t feel like explaining to your mother that Nora had told you that she hadn&#39;t aged a day since taking on the job at the cafe, and combined with the promise of lifetime job security, you were looking at a very long career. At least your contract promised the legally obliged vacation time (even if you&#39;d still be legally &#39;employed&#39; in that time, so you&#39;d still be a cat girl maid and... you were fine with that, you wondered how you&#39;d like in a black swim suit with white lace ). <br />
<br />
One of the crazier things was how Phyllis had no trouble putting on or off her dress, or putting on a night gown, or anything that might have hinted that she hadn&#39;t been male that morning. And your clothes had morphed into french lance as soon as you put them on, and STAYED that way when you took them off. <br />
<br />
You actually felt somewhat uncomfortable with Phyllis in your room, given what you knew, but what she remarked on after watching the anime. <br />
<br />
She admitted, &quot;Ya know ... I&#39;m not getting anything from the ladies in the anime, I can tell they&#39;re good looking and everything but I just... don&#39;t feel anything special. The guys on the other hand... they suddenly seem... a lot more interesting.&quot; Phyllis admitted, she didn&#39;t sound scared or confused, more like she was just making an observation. <br />
<br />
You found Mom was already gone when you woke up. You hoped she didn&#39;t do anything foolish to Madam Rikku Minazuki, as one of her loyal maids, you natural felt concern for her safety. <br />
<br />
After washing, and making sure you were were perfectly presentable, came a modest breakfast. Since she&#39;d slept over, Phyllis offered to give you a ride down to work. <br />
<br />
It had been late last night, and the last thing on your mind, but now you asked, <br />
&quot;Phyllis, did your car have a hole for tails before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... now that you ask, no, it didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t really think about it before. I guess it has to do with making me being a cat girl maid be normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
You then realized you were very very very VERY GRATEFUL that your mother HADN&#39;T seen your stitched up claw marks on your back from your fight with Frisky, the last thing you needed was your mother thinking your job was dangerous! Hopefully they&#39;d heal soon enough and mother wouldn&#39;t notice. At least Frisky was going to sporting marks on her face for a while... you wondered... would that LESSEN her presentation as a lovely lady of her establishment, or would it add to a &#39;bad girl&#39; persona? Presentation was important, and even if she brow beat Luan/Fifi for just saying high to you, you didn&#39;t want to ruin someone else&#39;s presentation, it wasn&#39;t proper for a maid to do. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Madam Rikku Minazuki hoped that Phyllis and Beverly enjoyed the &#39;welcome to the family&#39; treat baskets she&#39;d made them last night... After the incredibly rough first day that Beverly had, she didn&#39;t want the girl thinking every day was going to be like that. First impressions were everything, which as a cat girl maid herself, she knew very well. <br />
<br />
As assistant manager, Nora had shown up soon after her, counting in drawers and flipping signs and getting the kitchen ready and running the daily bug check on the Persona spells. This meant she had to go through each persona before marking them off as working properly. <br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t expected an angry little girl in a black dress covered with constellation diamond and a little hammer to come barging into her office. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Madam Rikku! She wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer!&quot; Nora said, the blue haired cat girl bowing repeatedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Lady Libra! Bringer of Balance, and the solemn judge of the Constellation Collaborative! Are you the owner of this place and its maids?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nora, go back to getting the shop ready for opening, and be sure to give Phyllis and Beverly their gift packages.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes miss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s in those?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy, muffins, paper grass, an exotic butter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Libra sensed they were completely mundane. <br />
<br />
&quot; Madam Rikku! Are you sure you&#39;ll be fine?!&quot; Nora asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Nora, there&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Madam.&quot; Nora bowed and closed the door. <br />
<br />
Madam Rikku kept her calm face as best she could facing an angry ten year old with super powers. &quot;I am the owner of this cafe... but I am the EMPLOYER of the ladies who work here, not their &#39;owner&#39;, they aren&#39;t slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you call a magical bind contract that changes their bodies and mind then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They consented to the contract of their own free without force, and it&#39;s seriously cuts down on training time, and keeps things from being uncomfortable for them and customers and keeps me from having to turn down employees. I am completely certified.&quot; Madam Rikku pointed at the various certificates on the walls. <br />
<br />
Lady Libra glanced around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Magical Trickster License, <br />
Business Owner License, <br />
Reality Distortion License,<br />
Magical Shop Owner License, <br />
Business&#39; state tax and federal tax ID numbers,<br />
Physical Transformation License,<br />
Mental Transformation License,<br />
A seal of approval from the FDA,  <br />
My Small Business Owners Guild Membership Card, <br />
<br />
And an up to date certificate that guaranteed I am not selling nor treating my employees as slaves, sexual or otherwise, and that all my employees have signed their contracts of their own free will and had not been coerced.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Lady Libra frowned and glared at Rikku.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re Beverly&#39;s sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m her mother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Well, I knew Beverly had something unusual about her with her remembering one of my employees used to be male before she&#39;d signed her contract. I assure you that I look after all my employees and ensure their safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then! I&#39;d like to say that your &#39;maids&#39; pretending to be magical girls is a very poor joke!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rikku sighed, feeling a headache coming on, she really didn&#39;t want to deal with this, but she had to. <br />
<br />
&quot;My maids becoming temporarily magical girls falls under the Cosplay Protection Act, and that the title of &#39;magical girl&#39; in of itself is public domain I might add. And we include a disclaimer that we are not associated with the Magical Girls International. And aren&#39;t you slightly stepping your bounds as a RETIRED magical girl?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I&#39;m retired?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re a mother for starters. Most magical girls die in battle, or live for centuries. But you&#39;ve been mortal long enough to have a family. And realistically... if I really was an illegal cursed shop owner or a trafficker, you wouldn&#39;t be here without back up, or were insanely powerful, or you had allies hidden and the place is bugged, but I know my own home enough to know that isn&#39;t the case.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lady Libra noticed as she stood up, Rikku had green eyes, hair, and fur on her ears and tail that all matched the color of her dress. Rikku pushed up on her glasses. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see... I&#39;m a Cat Girl Maid myself... I didn&#39;t know magic when I was turned into one, but I learned. And I want to do some good with my talents and what I&#39;ve become. If you want to rattle some cages, you can try across the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Across the street?&quot; Lady Libra asked somewhat confused.<br />
<br />
 Madam Rikku Minazuki sighed. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I couldn&#39;t show you this place before Fifi. If I show up late to work again, the Mistress will bite my head off!&quot; Perdia joked. <br />
<br />
&quot;With which head of hers?&quot; Fifi asked innocently.<br />
<br />
The establishment was on the edge of town, decidedly away from the central part of the city, away from the main street of Neko and Inu cafes. It&#39;s outside was dark brick and mortar, with bars on the windows. The ceiling was flat. The whole place gave the impression of being mostly underground rather than above ground. A triple X in pink neon much like the two cafes was above the irony front door. <br />
<br />
Unlike Neko, it was not in direct competition with the Inu Cafe. So it was not on the &#39;forbidden list.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact,&quot; the Dalmatian girl explained, still in the revealing dress she&#39;d worn the night Beverly had seen her, &quot;this place is kinda an unofficial &#39;neutral ground&#39; for us ladies. The unofficial part is why it wasn&#39;t in the job orientation magic.  <br />
<br />
Neither Inu maid really cared about the looks their style of dress gave them, any sense of shame or modesty had been removed as per their contracts. Even being in this shady part of town. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool Perdia! Thanks for showing me! I can&#39;t wait to invite Beverly here!&quot; Fifi said. Beverly had always been the &#39;good girl&#39;, and Beverly always said &#39;no&#39; to places like this, but that wouldn&#39;t stop Fifi from trying. &quot;Too bad it&#39;s just the two of us.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wolfie couldn&#39;t leave because of her job as the bouncer, and Frisky... was feeling a little anti-social after her fight with Beverly, and nursing the claw marks on her face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s better with just us two right now.&quot; Perdia said. &#39;Perdia.&#39; Perdia herself had worked at Inu Cafe for so long even she wasn&#39;t sure what her name had been before. Not that she thought about it nor cared. She was a loyal dog for the Inu Cafe&#39;s pack, and a dog that wasn&#39;t loyal was no dog at all. <br />
<br />
On either side of the iron door was two stone statues, a man on one side, and a woman on the other, both were incredibly muscular, both had non-human heads and other traits that reflected the theme of the building, and both were... very well endowed for their respective gender&#39;s traits. Fifi could swear they were looking at her. <br />
<br />
Perdia rapped on the iron door with the back of her paw. The door&#39;s visor slide open. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Buru Cafe,&quot; said a deep voice behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Tavros... just wanna introduce Fifi to the place,&quot; Waved Perdia not imitated by the solid blood red eyes beyond. <br />
<br />
&quot;You may enter.&quot; An iron bar slid out of place and the door swung upward revealing a set of stairs leading down.<br />
<br />
Fifi gasped and in spite of her mental changes still blushed. It was a minotaur, hoof feet, long tail, hands that ended with thick armored fingers, very dark brown fur, no &#39;hair&#39;, the head of a bull... and all the male equipment of one. He wasn&#39;t &#39;technically&#39; naked... he had nipple rings and a nose ring and earring. He was also towering over both of them, he had to be eight feet tall! Fifi found her eyes continuing to water to the thing between his legs. <br />
<br />
The entire place was bathed in a red light by colored lamps. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come inside my ladies.&quot; He bowed lowly so he was almost on even height with them. Fifi also noticed he had a metal collar around his neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Tavros.&quot; Perdia took Fifi&#39;s hand and led her down, the door was shut behind them. After going down at least one floor possibly more, they came to a large flat area with a faint incense smell in the air. <br />
<br />
Fifi looked around, minotaurs stomped around, all of them as naked as Tavros, all wearing collars, some had tattoos, some had piercings, but all of them going around with no modesty or shame with their equipment on full display for all to see. <br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;This way my ladies,&quot; Said another minotaur, black fur covered in white skull tattoos with solid white eyes and led them to a round table. The ceiling fan slowly spun. The floor had a rough red carpet, the walls were all wooden, and had paintings of various lewd scenes. there was a full bar. The customers... weren&#39;t all human, most of them weren&#39;t in fact. Some had never been human. A dress code didn&#39;t exist here. There were creature that Fifi thought only existed in fair tales... or her worst nightmares sitting at stools and drinking it up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, slave, more wine!&quot; Said what Fifi could only guess was a dark elf... white hair, charcoal colored skin, red eyes (with whites, not solid red), pointed ears, lithe figure, naked and drunk, with tattoos covering him. And a pet tarantula crawling on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master,&quot; said the nearest minotaur refilling his glass obediently. Stepping over the dark elf&#39;s clothes. <br />
<br />
Fifi fidgeted a little. She wasn&#39;t Beverly, but even she wasn&#39;t sure about this place. <br />
<br />
Perdia put a spotted paw on her blond one, assuring the poodle woman. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, none of them can hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that, &#39;slave?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rumors has it that all the minotaurs are ex-convicts, or death row inmates who were given a &#39;choice&#39;, if you can call it that, and were brain-zapped to Hell and back. Frisky and Wolfie told me that&#39;s hogwash stirred up by the owner to increase her popularity. You know what they say, no such thing as bad publicity.&quot; <br />
<br />
What Fifi could only guess was a female goblin, short, green, warty, definitely an adult woman, claws instead of fingers and toes, BIG ears, wild red hair like a mane, solid slit eyes, and a knot of a nose, and a maw full of fangs. She was holding a glass of dear, naked instead for a brown cloak. Her clothes her size hanging up next to a large &#39;mirror&#39;. Mirror well, it showed a spiraling purple storm, and had a golden frame around it&#39;s tall round surface. <br />
<br />
The goblin woman laughed and slapped one of the minotaurs in the butt, he merely continued on. <br />
<br />
Fifi began to feel a bit &#39;out&#39; with her and Perdia seemingly the only ones in here fully dressed. The low lights (not red colored) added to the &#39;mood.&#39; One of the minotaur brought them a menu... it was huge selection of meats (both mammal, bird, fish, insect,etc) and alcoholic beverages. Fifi just ordered the ribs that Perdia did. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to get naked too?&quot; Fifi asked, genuinely not concerned, just curious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
Having met her Mistress, the dog woman owner of the Inu Cafe, ... Fifi was scared and yet had to ask. &quot;Perdia, who is the owner?&quot;<br />
<br />
In spite of her many changes to her mind as she&#39;d agreed to, a part of Fifi would still have her running out of the place screaming if the owner turned out to be a little man in red pajamas with a pitch fork. <br />
<br />
&quot;That would be her over there.&quot; Perdia pointed, with all the eye catchings of the place, Fifi was still surprised she&#39;d missed the woman Perdia pointed at. <br />
<br />
It was the only female minotaur present. She was behind the bar, between two similar statues as those two minotaur and minotauress watching statues outside. She lay on her side a giant purple felt pillow, blowing smoke from a extremely long cigar holder. She was what victorians would call well rounded. Her colors were splotches of white and black. Her lip stick was thick. She had hair that was as purple as her pillow and was in an nearly infinite number of curls. Her earring was adorned with a huge ruby. Her fingers had jeweled rings on them of various colors. As did her legs&#39; hooves have gold bracelet. She also had fetish chained gold jewelry that connected her two nipples together and reached down to her belly button. <br />
<br />
In spite of what would appear to be just a piece of lewd eye candy, her present was commanding and overwhelming, Fifi felt smaller just looking at her, the minotauress&#39; eyes continued to watchfully scan the place behind her calm demeanor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is she... dangerous?&quot; Fifi whispered, sure the cow woman owner heard her anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw her once snap her hooves, and a guy who came in here who got TOO rowdy, every minotaur in the place turned on him at once like a switch was pulled... you don&#39;t wanna know what happened next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Fifi shivered.<br />
<br />
Pedia patted her on the back. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it! Nothing bad is gonna happen to you or me here. I&#39;ve been here with the others before. Don&#39;t worry.&quot; <br />
<br />
While Fifi thought the place looked definite fun, warning bells wouldn&#39;t stop going off in her mind, but she wouldn&#39;t abandon Pedia here, that was not was a good doggy did. That being said, she ate her ribs as fast as she could when they arrived. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Fifi, if you eat that fast, we won&#39;t get to see some of the patrons have some real fun with the minotaurs waiters.&quot;<br />
<br />
At hearing that, for reasons she didn&#39;t understand, Fifi ate faster.</p>
