<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mr. President, we have some very valuable information for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
A man and woman stood in the Oval Office; both wore lab coats and carried a <br />
large tablet with diagrams and equations between them. <br />
They looked to be fresh out of college, the man had a full but well-kempt beard, <br />
the woman had sleek brown hair that reached to her waist. The title page of the <br />
tablet read &quot;GENOME MISTAKE?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; the leader of the United States told them. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Dr. Jeff Prafesser, and this is my wife, Dr. Nancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Prafesser?&quot; the President repeated with a grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quite the irony isn't it, Sir? But please allow us to continue, this may change <br />
life as we know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Through our research, we have found the possibility that the Human Genome <br />
Project may have missed something. It appears to be a very rare case, about 1 <br />
in 10,000, but there appears to be another gene humans are capable of having. <br />
This 'Genome &szlig;' has a very profound effect for those who carry it. We tested <br />
this gene by inserting it into mice. After activation, this gene changed the mice <br />
in ways unimaginable. Their strength, agility, flexibility, and stamina were <br />
increased tenfold (they even required less food to do it and could live longer <br />
without food or water!). Their intelligence rose dramatically, making them the <br />
mice equivalent of a genius. Moreover, their immune system became almost <br />
perfect. Not only did they contract no diseases, but cancerous cells we <br />
introduced were attacked before we could pull the needle out. Even HIV was <br />
completely obliterated. We cut one of the mice's legs off; the leg was <br />
immediately replaced. Similarly, wounds were healed instantly: I dropped a <br />
scapel on a mouse and it sliced through its head. The wound immediately <br />
closed around it and the scalpel disintegrated up to it's skin. We ran an x-ray <br />
and the metal was completely gone! Their lifespans also doubled and their <br />
fertility increased and was perfected so that all of their offspring were likewise <br />
gifted. You can see why research for humans would be quite benificial.&quot;<br />
<br />
The President said nothing but watched and listened as the two gave example <br />
after example of what had happened and what could be. But he was a smart <br />
man. After the presentation, he offered one question: &quot;What's the catch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see, sir, activation of the gene is extremely difficult. In almost any <br />
normal circumstance this gene remains dormant, hence the lack of superheroes <br />
running around. Gene &szlig; is extremely fickle as well. In order to activate the <br />
gene, two mice with the exact same genes had to meet. In other words, a clone <br />
had to meet its original. Activation of the gene came when the two mice had <br />
any form of intercourse. The DNA from one mouse entered its clone and <br />
activated the gene, which then sent a signal back to the first mouse to activate <br />
its gene. Once activated, Gene &szlig; created these great effects; however, it was <br />
also responsible for random and unexplained mutations. Some mice went bald, <br />
only to grow their fur back twice as long. Some mice grew in size while others <br />
shrank. Some gained appendages, some lost them. In one case, we had a <br />
mouse change genders flawlessly, it was fertile. In another, the mouse became <br />
a gerbil. When any change caused a change in major DNA structure, the gene <br />
'shut off'. The mouse was no longer endowed with its amazing enhancements. <br />
However, the gene remained active enough to cause more changes. If the <br />
mouse reverted to normal, it regained its new abilities. Basically, Gene &szlig; is <br />
unreliable at best. Fortunately, we have worked out a few of its kinks. With a <br />
simple antidote taken daily, the mouse was able to control its transformations to <br />
become what it wanted or to not change at all. With research, we hope to <br />
perfect this gene and use it to make humans a more sustainable race. As for <br />
human testing, we would need permission to clone a human. This human must <br />
carry the gene for homo- or bisexuality as the gene requires intercourse for <br />
activation. It would also be necessary to ensure that the two were raised <br />
equally, in order to keep their bodies and minds as identical as possible. Which <br />
is why we have come to you, sir. Please consider this proposal carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do see some potential in this discovery. Unfortunately, the downside of this <br />
gene is that it could easily make someone too powerful. Such human subjects <br />
would have to be taught carefully and strictly so that they did not develop <br />
malicious tendencies. As for the propagation of a superhuman species, that <br />
could bring no end of trouble. I tell you these things because of two reasons: 1) <br />
I think this gene may be better left alone, unactivated in humans, we are much <br />
to imperfect and hasty to be given such power; 2) the choice does not belong to <br />
me to approve, you would have to get the world's approval. I know this isn't <br />
what you want to hear, so I will warn you: do not try to play God. I get the <br />
sense that you are not believers, but the concept remains. If you are caught <br />
trying to further this research on humans after you leave, you will be taken to <br />
maximum security prisons to live out the rest of your days in empty white <br />
rooms. I strongly encourage you to keep your research to mice, find out <br />
everything you want, kill those mice, and burn your research. This should not <br />
see the light of day again. That is my final word; good day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two were incredulously herded out of the room by two Secret Service <br />
agents. <br />
<br />

<br />
In a quite hospital room, a new mother slept heavily, her husband sleeping in <br />
the chair next to her. A nurse came in and walked over to the baby's bed. She <br />
wrote down the information, then took a needle and drew a sample of the <br />
baby's blood. The nurse then walked out, her waist-length hair flowing behind <br />
her. After a stop to the medical files of the baby boy, which she copied on a <br />
hand-held scanner, she walked out to a waiting hovercar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; a man with a beard asked her as they drove away. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's a deep subject,&quot; the woman joked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, this is serious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but you're so uptight. We weren't caught, relax. We've bugged the <br />
faily's house so we know exactly how to raise him. We send him out to find his <br />
originator, they screw, we have our research. We're creating a new race, be <br />
happy for once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until I know it works.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lights on a dashboard machine lit up. An egg had been filled with the host <br />
DNA. Nancy was ready for insemination, the child she gave birth to would not <br />
be her own, and she would not be able to raise him how she wanted. He would <br />
be exactly like his host. And together, they would be superhumans.</p>
