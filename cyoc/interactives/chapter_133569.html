<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When it became clear that nothing was off, or so that he could see, Aurora looked down at the note and read the next question. Yet, nothing of what he read made any sense, as his fledgling Alicorn was really starting to bother him. Reaching up to scratch it and the surrounding the area, he tried again to read the question. When it became clear he wasn’t able to take a single word in, Aurora huffed in agitation, glanced at his friends and said, “Would you excuse for a moment?” and without waiting to see what they’d do, he set aside the note, stood and left his friend’s room.<br />
<br />
His weight causing the floor beneath him the groan slightly, Aurora made his way through the trailer and outside. Heading for a couple trees, he tapped a fist against the nearest, moved on to the next and repeated the same thing. When he finally found a tree will suitable feeling bark and sounding wood, he twisted his head one way, then another as he attempted scratch at the persisting itch.<br />
<br />
After a couple clumsy tries, he finally settled into a comfortable groove until the itch began to fade. Soothed, Aurora breathed a sigh of relief. Turning away the tree, Aurora made his way back inside. Sitting down in his friend’s room, he reached for the note and muttered, “Sorry about that,” as Alyssa and Elva each set aside whatever it was they were reading. Glancing at the note, feeling better, Aurora took a deep breath and read, ‘Question 7. If you were a girl, what colour would your hair be?’<br />
<br />
Not even giving it a second thought, Aurora immediately answered, ‘If I were a girl, my hair would be silvery-white, with my mane and tail be a slight shade darker than my coat.’<br />
<br />
The moment he finished, a slightly shaggy silver-white coat of hair began sprouting over his body. Passing the note to his right, Aurora shifted uncomfortably as his tail started to form, whilst on his head, his hair began to thin in some places and grow thicker in others as a thick mane that matched his tail began to develop. As Elva took the note, Aurora shifted a bit more, but unable to take the feeling of how uncomfortable his clothes felt, especially pinched around his now expanding tailing bone, Aurora called upon his magick and used it to remove his clothes.<br />
<br />
Elva, unaware that anything was happening to his friend, took the note and read what was being inquired. Noticing that the word hair had changed to fur, but unaware that it had done so, he set the note down in front of him. Thinking about his answer, he soon replied, ‘If I were a girl, except for around my eye and going up to and covering my left ear, which would be black, I’d have short white fur.’<br />
<br />
A fur coat, matching what he’d described, starting to spread over his body, Elva waited a moment to see if the note would do anything. His ears starting to lengthen slightly to a sharp point and move up to the top of his head, Elva handed the piece of paper to Alyssa, who read the same question Aurora had been asked.<br />
<br />
Content with what his current hair colour was, Alyssa reasoned that the point of a creating a character was to create something that was both new and something of the person who was making the character. Glancing down at his character sheet, considering using that information he wrote there, he eventually decided to mix the information printed that stated the character’s hair was medium blonde. Thinking about his own dark brown hair, Alyssa answered, ‘If I were a girl, my hair would be a medium brownish-blonde, come down to just past my shoulders and have a slight curl to it.’<br />
<br />
Hair slowly morphing to match his response, Alyssa handed the note to Aurora, whose ears were beginning to transform into equine ears. Taking the note, Aurora read, ‘Question 8. If you were a girl, what shade are your eyes?’<br />
<br />
Not even giving it a second thought, Aurora answered, ‘If I were a girl, my eyes would be ice blue,’ then passed the note to Elva, who also read it and replied, ‘If I were a girl my eye colour would be light black, bordering on brown,’ without giving it another thought. Handing the piece of paper to Alyssa, Elva’s friend read what was asked, then replied, ‘If I were a girl, my eyes would be a shade of stormy grey,’ deciding to match his answer slightly with what was on his character sheet.<br />
<br />
Each of their eyes changing to match their replies, Aurora used his magick to levitate the note closer when Alyssa handed it to him. His fledgling Alicorn starting to itch again, he choose to ignore it as he read, ‘Question 9. If you were a girl, would you pee sitting down?’<br />
<br />
Unsure how best to answer this, Aurora tried to think of how best to answer this. Thinking of biology classes, but drawing a blank, he re-read the inquiry a couple more times before answer, ‘If I were a girl, I guess I would pee normally for someone of my species and sex,’ then watched as his response shrunk and a different question formed, offering a question based on information on how a mare normally peed.<br />
<br />
Carefully reading all that was printed, not wanting to miss anything, Aurora thought about it a minute before writing, ‘Yes. If I were a girl I would pee exactly like that. I’d spread my legs slightly, but wouldn’t squat down, unless I needed to’ thought about what he’d wrote, added a bit more that he believed would flesh out the character, then handed the note to Elva.<br />
<br />
As his friend’s penis started to shrink and reform into the appropriate anatomy of a mare, Elva absently took the note, lost in thought. He wasn’t sure, but he thought Alyssa’s hair was longer and darker brown. Trying to recall, but only remembering him with the brownish-blonde hair that he had that fell to a bit past his shoulder, Elva mulled over whether this inconsistent memory had anything to do with the oddities that had been discussed before they’d moved to Alyssa’s room. Feeling conflicted about his friend’s hair, Elva looked at the note but didn’t read the question.<br />
<br />
Mind working over the issues he was having, certain the note was somehow behind it, he asked himself, “Did one of us fail to answer one of the questions and so the bit of paper answered for us?” as he struggled to recall what the bit of paper had warned them. Drawing a blank, he read the inquiry and without paying attention to what he wrote, Elva answered, ‘If I were a girl, I’d squat to pee,’ then handed the note to Alyssa as his penis started to shrink and reform to what was normal for a bitch.<br />
<br />
Inattentively running a hand through his hair, Alyssa took the note. Not even looking at the question, he instead let his mind wander as he tried to look at Aurora and Elva without making it obvious that he was looking. Glancing down at the note, he thought that for reasons he’d couldn’t explain, it was weird to see Aurora with a shaggy coat of silvery-white hair and Elva with a coat of white fur that covered everywhere except over his left eye and up over his left ear. Memories insisting it was normal, he absently ran a hand through his hair and wondered if his hair had changed. No answer coming to him, he focused on the note and read what was printed. <br />
<br />
“That’s an odd thing to ask,” he though and thinking, “Of course I would pee sitting down. How else would I?” he wrote, ‘If I were a girl, yes, I would pee sitting down. I could also, if I chose to, spread me legs and squat. But I generally wouldn’t, as it seems rather improper,’ before handing to bit of paper to his right.<br />
<br />
Aurora taking the note and looking at it expected another question. To his amazement, the bit of paper stated, ‘Let’s do something different for the next two questions. You like to roll up characters using D6s. Let’s say these two question require you to think like you are rolling up a stat, with 10 being average, anything below that is subpar and anything above that being exceptional. Sound good?’<br />
<br />
Confused why the character creation bit was being changed, Aurora read the note aloud then asked, “What do you girls think?” unaware that he’d used a different pronoun to address his friends.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, it was Elva was answered by saying, “Could be interesting. But, I do wonder how these next to questions exactly fit into the concept of rolling up a character, like the ones we have for DnD. Up until now, the questions have been straight forward, asking us to think about a female character we would create of ourselves and how that character would fit into whatever the piece of paper is asking about.”<br />
<br />
Alyssa nodded in response and whilst Aurora reminded himself that what Elva had said shouldn’t have surprised him too much, as his friend every once and while did say something profound, Alyssa stated, “I agree with Elva. Yeah, it could shake up the character creations. But why now? Why not continue with the same format?”<br />
<br />
No answer coming to any of them, Aurora eventually asked, “So, should we go with what is suggested?” to which each of his two friends eventually nodded.<br />
<br />
Curiosity getting the best of him, Aurora also nodded. Muttering, “Let’s do this,” and looking down at the note, he read, ‘Question 10. If you were a girl, how emotional would you be? 10 being average; anything below is subpar; anything above would be exceptional,’ to which he wondered what the piece of paper meant by saying anything about ten would be exceptional. Thinking carefully over his options, he eventually went with a ten, figuring that since he didn’t quite understand, it was best to err on the side of being average as he gave the note to Elva.<br />
<br />
His friend taking the paper and reading the question also found himself stumped as to how best to answer. Curious to know what was meant by subpar and exceptional, Elva wondered if this was like saying someone was an emotional train wreck versus someone having the emotional range of a Vulcan. Looking down on his character sheet, he tried to make a connection with what was being asked to the numbers he’d listed in his stats, all of which were between 12 and 16. After a couple minutes, he gave up and also wrote down ten.<br />
<br />
Certain it was the best answer, he gave the question one final reading before handing the note to Alyssa, who took it, read it and also found himself confused by the question. Like his friends before him, Alyssa tried to figure what exactly was meant by such a question, but unlike his friends, he eventually wrote, ‘When you say “subpar” and “exceptional”, what exactly it meant?’<br />
<br />
The words, ‘Think of it as someone who is a total basket case, subpar, versus someone who doesn’t show any arrangement of emotions, keeping them all in check’ forming, Alyssa thought about it for a bit, then asked, ‘So would be like an elven or twelve being someone who keeps their cool in a tense situation?’ to which the note responded with a, ‘Yes.’<br />
<br />
Still kind of unsure about the question, but feeling like he had a little bit of a better understanding, Alyssa thought about what he should answer with before finally writing, ‘If I were a girl, my emotion stat would be an 11.5.’ Reading his answer and comparing it with what he’d been told, then going back over everything else, he thought about it a bit longer before finally passing it to his right.<br />
<br />
Only to find that there was no one to his right. Curious to know where Aurora had went, and when he’d left, Alyssa looked at Elva, who was thumbing through a core rulebook. Asking, “Do you know where Aurora went?” he set the piece of paper down on the hardbound book close to where his friend had been sitting.</p>
