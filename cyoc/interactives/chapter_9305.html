<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Huh? What just happened to me?&quot; Jared wondered out loud to himself.<br />
The tingling sensation  stops and is replaced by a hot, prickly itch that quickly spreads all over his body. He lets go of the medallion and listens as it falls to the ground at his feet. And just as he is about to let go of the dog collar and scratch his chest, he feels the it disappear from his hand. Grimacing in annoyance, he looks around for it. He doesn’t see it anywhere in his room. But as he tries to deal with itchiness, he feels the dog collar around his neck. His eyes widen and his breath quickens. He tries to take it off with just his right hand while pulling up his shirt with his other hand. Jared pulls his shirt out of his pants and looks down at his chest. Annoyance gives way to shock as he finds his chest changing right before his very eyes. And then shock gives way to horror as he sees that his chest is getting covered over by a thick layer of white fur. <br />
&quot;Fur?!? How? What? What’s happening to me!&quot; He growls under his breath. His voice barely understandable even to his own ears. <br />
No longer bothering with the dog collar around his neck, Jared quickly takes off his shirt as his chest continues to change before his very eyes. He drops the shirt onto the ground next to the medallion. He looks at his chest and then at his arms. And he sees that the layer of white fur has now started to cover them. With wide eyes, he watches as the fur grows thicker and shaggier with each passing second. First a glance and then with a much longer look, he notices that his hands were starting to change. His fingers grew stubbier and smaller. And his thumbs looked like that they were being pulled away from his fingers. His fingernails thickened into running claws. Paw-like pads then appeared on the palms of his hands and the tips of his fingers. <br />
Wanting to see what was happening to the rest of his body, Jared awkwardly ran across the room to the bathroom that he shared with his little brother. Once inside, he stopped in front of the mirror and looked at himself in the mirror overlooking the bathroom sink. The thick white fur that had started on his chest had now grown over his cheeks, chin and neck. A thick, white beard and mustache covered his lower face and hung off his chin. His lips and nose were black and wet. The hair on the top of his head was now fuller, thicker and shaggier and was growing down his forehead. He watches at first his right ear and then his left ear fold over themselves and drop to the sides of his head.<br />
&lt;I am.. I am becoming an Old English Sheepdog! Just.. just like that guy in those old movies! How is this possible?&gt;  <br />
His eyes widen again as he just realizes that he didn’t speak out loud with his own voice. That he barked and woofed and growled just like a real dog. <br />
Jared practically falls on his butt from the shock of losing his human voice. But his shock is briefly overshadowed by an odd feeling from his feet. Hurriedly and awkwardly he takes off his shoes and socks. The long bones of his feet lengthen and are swallowed up by more of the thick, white, shaggy fur covering his body. His toes and toenails join his hands as they grow smaller and more paw-like. <br />
&lt;What can I do? Who can help me with this?&gt;<br />
He takes off his pants and gazes at the shaggy dark blue merle fur covering his canine legs. He then feels a docked tail sprout from the end of his spine. He jerks off his boxer shorts as he feels his privates changing. Feeling less horrified and oddly more content with his changes, he watches as a fold of skin grows over his dick and balls, and pulls them in closer to his narrow bear-like hips. His shaggy fur-covered face pushes out into a muzzle. Another look over his body reveals to him that he is now covered by the hard, profuse and shaggy fur coat of an adult Old English Sheepdog. His teeth feel pointy to his tongue as he opens his muzzle to let it out. His arms and legs grow and shrink till they are of the same length. <br />
Jared then stretches his shaggy fur-covered body off the bathroom floor and stands up on all fours. He strangely feels content with what he sees as his neck finishes moving to the back of his large, shaggy head. He finds himself no longer afraid from what had just happened to him. And oddly enough, he feels what had just happened to him to be completely natural. He stands up on his hind legs and leans the bulk of his body against the bathroom countertop. He looks into the mirror and begins to pant contentedly at the sight of his face reflected back at him from its reflective surface. He smiles. For through the shaggy fur covering his eyes like a veil, he sees that he is now a large, shaggy and very friendly Old English Sheepdog.<br />
&lt;Wow! I am a real sheepdog!&gt; He woofs out loud to himself, feeling quite pleased with himself.</p>
