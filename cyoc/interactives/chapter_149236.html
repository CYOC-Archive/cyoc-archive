<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He still felt that Angelique had not told him the truth. But, scared by the possibility of being caught by the other two she&#39;s mentioned, Mike took the clothes being offered, not liking the idea of dressing as a girl, but seeing no other option. The woman smiled at him, nodded and walked around him. Lighting the wick on another oil lamp, she replaced the glass top and headed for the the door she had directed him toward. Disappearing through it, Mike could see, from where he stood, a very small bathroom. <br />
<br />
As if someone else controlled him, Mike eventually walked over to it and peered in. Seeing that it consisted of a toilet, sink, a stand, which Angelique was setting the oil lamp on, and a shower that was only a smidge bigger than his closet, Mike listened as the woman told, &quot;Hurry up and get changed. The sooner you get out here, the better,&quot; before slipping past him, shutting the door as she went.<br />
<br />
Clothes still clutched tightly in his arms, Mike found he could not believe he was about to do what he knew he was going to do. Setting the garments on the edge of the sink, he peered into the mirror above the sink and asked himself, &quot;Are you sure this is a good idea. And can you actually trust this woman and what she is telling you,&quot; to which, he found he had no answer, except what his gut kept insisting, which was that the woman was hiding something from him.<br />
<br />
After a couple more seconds of staring at himself in the mirror, Mike huffed and reached down for article of clothing on top of the pile, but changed his mind at the last moment. Sitting down on the toilet, he shucked off his shoes and socks, which he rolled up and stuffed inside the canvas high tops. Afterward, he stood and pulled off his shirt, then his pants and underwear all in one go. Naked, leaving his clothes on top of the toilet lid, he returned to mirror and stared at his reflection. Thinking of that was happening, certain he was missing something, failing to make the connection that if he was in danger so were the others, Mike idly fiddled with the pile of clothes. Sighing, unable to figure out what he was missing, he turned his attention to the pile of clothes.<br />
<br />
He was certain it was stupid and that he was being stupid by even considering wearing the clothes. But, believing Angelique was telling the truth when she said he was in danger and that she could help him leave, Mike picked through the garments, noting he had been given a pair of canvas slip-on shoes, a pair of whitish-pink socks, underwear that was white with pastel flowers printed on it, a pair of jeans he thought looked too small and had four buttons instead of one button and a zipper, a white button-up shirt that had no buttons, a white tank top that had a black silhouette of a unicorn rearing up on its back legs and the statement &quot;I&#39;m Not Weird I&#39;m a Unicorn&quot; printed on it, a white lacy bra that, at first, Mike thought was all one piece until he found that it unclasped in the front, and, lastly, a pair of flesh covered things that Mike couldn&#39;t figure out what they were until he realised that they went in the bra and gave him the appearance of having boobs.<br />
<br />
The thoughts, &quot;This is nuts,&quot; and, &quot;I&#39;m nuts,&quot; crossed his mind as he picked up the panties and for a split second, he almost put then down, determined to get dressed in his own clothes and tell Angelique he&#39;d take his chances.<br />
<br />
But, before he could fully change his mind, he slipped on the underwear, found the bulge of his junk didn&#39;t look right, pushed the panties back down and, after fiddling about, tucked his dick and nuts back between his legs. Pulling the underwear back up, he found them to be rather tight, but, again, after adjusting, the snug sensation passed, leaving him only with a feeling of being upset on how flat his front looked. Reassuring himself that it was fine, that all he had to do was pull down on the panties and the familiar bulge of his junk would present itself, Mike reached for the jeans.<br />
<br />
Slipping them on, he was at first convinced they wouldn&#39;t fit. They were too tight in the legs and when he finally managed to get them up, they would not button. Struggling for a moment, certain that he would have to tell the woman her plan wouldn&#39;t work, he was disappointed when it seem that the jeans seemed to either relax or become a size bigger, as he suddenly found them loose in a comfortable way and that he could button up the front. Discovering that it enhanced the appearance that he had nothing down there, Mike wasn&#39;t sure why he did it, but reaching down between his legs, he pressed his hand against his cock, which was still pleantly tucked back between his legs. Disliking how he looked, and how comfortable he was finding wearing the clothes he on, he muttered, &quot;The sooner I&#39;m out here, the better,&quot; and reaching for the bra, he struggled a moment to put it on, the front clasp and the adjusters on the shoulders giving him the most problem.<br />
<br />
Once again, after he had finally gotten the bra fastened and had slipped the fake boobs in, then adjusted them, Mike peered first down at himself, then at his reflection. He did not like what he saw, as the jeans, in his opinion, rode way too high and were too tight, leaving no sign that he actually had a dick. Combined with the bra, which had some type of padding in the front, and the fake boobs, which matched his skin, the teenage boy thought he was looking at a girl from the neck down. Disturbed by this, he once more told himself, &quot;The sooner I&#39;m out of here, the better,&quot; and reaching for the tank top, he pulled it on, followed by button up.<br />
<br />
The shoes and socks being last, Mike did not believe either would fit. Fumbling a bit, he pulled on the socks, which didn&#39;t go up past his ankles and after a moment, slipped his feet into the shoes. To his surprise, the shoes not only fit, but also made his feet look smaller. Bewildered by this, he wiggled his toes, which were an inch or so from the front of the shoe and figuring it couldn&#39;t be helped that they were probably a size too big, he exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Outside, he was greeted by Angelique, who directed him to a nightstand, where she told him, &quot;Sit down and close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure why, he gave her a look that questioned what she was saying he should do. But, when the woman didn&#39;t give any response, he sighed and did what she told him.<br />
<br />
Angelique, after Mike had sat down, quickly set to work on the last bits. She sprinkled a fine powered on a brush and a comb, then set to work on his short hair, which, as she ran first the comb through it, then the brush, took on length and volume until,, when she finished it was down past Mike&#39;s shoulders and rather full and bushy in appearance. Afterward, she set to work and began applying various tonics, creams  and more of the powder to his face, giving it a rounder, feminine appearance. When she finished, she stepped back and studied Mike, who now looked less like a sixteen year old guy and more like a thirteen year old girl.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with what she saw, the woman felt a twinge of regret as she announced, &quot;Done,&quot; and as Mike opened his eyes, she took his hand and said, &quot;Come on. We should be okay now,&quot; before leading him across her room and out the door.<br />
<br />
In the hallway, the woman did not lead him back the way he&#39;d come, but rather further down the hall. The sensation like his head was spinning returning, Mike was barely able to keep track of where they were going as Angelique led him down the hall, turned a corner, led him down another corridor, turned another corner, and from there everything passed in a blur until she stopped in front of a wall. Watching as she pressed on, Mike found himself amazed when she opened a secret passage that led out onto a small landing and a set of ancient looking wood steps going down.<br />
<br />
Before he had too much time to look, he was given a quick prod, which he took that he was to go first. Down the stairs the two went, Mike in the lead and Angelique following. As they went, the woman studied the teenage boy, thinking on how, when she had first saw him, he had been about five foot nine, but now was closer to five foot. The regret she felt earlier coming back, she rationed it away with, &quot;It had to be done. At least he&#39;ll be safe,&quot; whilst in front of her Mike, who was oblivious to the fact that he had, at some point, gone from 135 pounds down to about 99 pounds, asked, &quot;How far down are we going,&quot; to which Angelique, who could hear the that his voice sounded more feminine, told him, &quot;All the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trip down uneventful, Mike started to grow bored about halfway and as his mind started to wander, he thought about the questions he had for the woman. Absently brushing his arm across the front of his shirt, he immediately forgot about asking them as he could have sworn he had felt it in the chest area. But, refusing to believe this, deciding he must had actually felt part of the lace of the bra brush his skin instead of the cup of the bra pressed against the breast and brushing a lock of hair back, he found himself glad when they finally came to the foot of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Angelique stepped past him and after she pushed on the wall before them, Mike watched as a section of it opened and the woman slipped through. About to follow, he stopped when she held up a hand and told him, &quot;Wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly alert to his surroundings, scared that the two she had warned about might have actually found them, Mike grunted when the woman grabbed his hand and pulled him across the threshold. Starting to run, pulling him alone, the woman gasped out, &quot;Run. Don&#39;t look back. I think I heard something,&quot; and doing as she told him, Mike was relieved when they slowed to a stop before a door.<br />
<br />
Winded, Mike bent over and put his hands on his knees. Another lock of hair falling before his line of sight, he thought, &quot;Gonna need to get a haircut before long,&quot; as he started to brush it back, but stopped when he noticed the bra he was wearing and the way the boobs sat in it.<br />
<br />
Something was off about it, but Mike couldn&#39;t at first figure out. Staring down his shirt, listening as the woman did something with the door, it slowly came to him that, if he didn&#39;t know any better, he was looking at a pair of A cup breasts. Figuring it was the way the boobs hugged his chest, even though he was certain, with how he was bent over, that they should have pulled away from his chest and be lying in the cups, he was distracted from the oddity of his chest and how it looked when Angelique said, &quot;Got it,&quot; and looking over at her, he watched as she opened a door.<br />
<br />
He could not quite see what was on the other side and for a split second he thought he heard voices talking. Wanting to ask what was on the other side, he was cut off when the woman said, &quot;Go quickly through here. It will take you out of the manor and back to a spot in town,&quot; and wanting to suddenly ask her his questions, Mike was confused when he saw the look of regret on her face.<br />
<br />
Alarmed by this, he was about to inquire about what he saw. But, before he got the chance, Angelique suddenly told him, &quot;Whatever you discover, be happy. Accept it. And know I am sorry for what I did,&quot; and before he realised what was happening, she shoved him through the door.</p>
