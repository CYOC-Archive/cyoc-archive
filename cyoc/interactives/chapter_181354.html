<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With things at the construction site taken care of for the time being, Kenneth headed out to the outskirts of the jungle to look for a few follows of his own. He’d willingly given up Chuck, but he wasn’t going to let any more prey slip away from him today. And as the Hunter, he felt it only appropriate that his quarry be tracked down in the jungle instead of amongst the cabanas and offices of the construction site.<br />
<br />
He raised his wolfish nose to the sky and sniffed the air, and a devious grin spread across his muzzle. “Mmm… Smells delicious,” he muttered as he licked his lips, then he disappeared into the underbrush to find his newest followers and induct them into his service.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Hidden away by the trees and brush, Lee and Eric were shirking work usual. They had snuck off an hour back to drink and get high instead of doing their jobs, and were too stoned too think about why nobody had come looking for them.<br />
<br />
“Damn, it’s such a nice day… Shame none of the other guys can join us,” Lee laughed as he took a hit of his joint. He’d been brought on as an electrician to handle the wiring and lightning, putting him at odds with the more physical construction workers, but he’d definitely hit it off with Eric. That is to say, neither of them had much interest in putting in a full day of work and were willing to cover for the other when they wanted to sneak off. Not that he was lacking when it came to physical strength; the buff Asian-American young man had done construction for years and could handle the work. He’d just rather have a little fun while he could.<br />
<br />
Eric just nodded and started up at the canopy. He was stoned out of his mind and didn’t look forward to heading back and getting an earful from the foreman, not knowing that at this point Bill (now Will) had no intention of doing so. “Dude… I’m getting hungry,” he muttered, patting his muscle gut and rubbing his eyes. “You bring anything to eat?”<br />
<br />
Lee shook his head. “Sorry. I guess we’d better head back-” he began to say, then he spotted something out of the corner of his eye. A small pile of juicy-looking fruit were resting at the base of a nearby tree. “Score! Those look pretty good to me!” Lee said, running over and grabbing one for himself. He bit into the fruit and juice flowed down his throat and down his face.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I don’t think you’re supposed to eat stuff if you don’t know what it is…” Eric murmured. “I was a boy scout and that’s rule number one.” His stomach suddenly let out a rumble and he chuckled sheepishly. “But, what the hell? Gimme one of those, Lee.”<br />
<br />
The two men feasted on their scavenged meal, slumping under a tree to relax and enjoy their buzz. Unknown to them, their bodies were already beginning to shift and transform to better suit the Hunter’s needs, preparing them to become experts of living off the land alongside their wolfish master.<br />
<br />
Lee sniffed the air and caught a new scent wafting toward them. A musky, animalistic, and undeniably male smell. “You smell that too, Eric?” he said quietly, unable to stop gulping down breaths of the addictive pheromones.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… It’s soooo hot,” Eric moaned, slipping a hand down his pants and starting to stroke himself. Lee nodded and joined him, unsure why his inhibitions had seemingly disappeared. The two men continued to giggle in a stoned bliss as they jacked themselves off in the woods, sensing the incredible scent that was making them so unbelievably horny growing closer and closer.<br />
<br />
Before long, their pants and boxers were tossed aside and they were pumping their cocks at full-speed, yet found themselves unable to cum despite feeling like their orgasm was mere seconds away. Lee looked over and frowned, sensing that something looked off about Eric.<br />
<br />
“Dude… Your cock is fucking huge…” Lee muttered, unable to take his eyes away from his friend’s endowment. With each stroke up and down, Eric’s dick seemed to grow longer and thicker, but that wasn’t what was truly odd. It wasn’t just long; it was inhumanly long, growing close to a foot long with no signs of stopping. And the skin around his crotch was becoming dark and leathery, dappled with white and brown spots, while his balls were getting simply massive and pendulous. Eric let out a snort and shook his head, letting out what almost sounded like a neigh as his cock topped off at a foot and a half long and changed even more, the tip becoming flat and animalistic as it drooled precum but was still unable to cum.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, pretty awesome, right?” Eric responded between moans, seemingly unconcerned about the changes his body was going through. Lee was so focused on Eric’s changes that he didn’t even notice that his body was going through similar changes. As he grew hornier and hornier, a sheath began to slowly slip its way up his shaft, which was likewise narrowing to a point and becoming a bright red, with a bulbous knot forming at the base and throbbing with pleasure. Fur began to spread outward from his sheath, coating his balls and thighs in soft brown fur before starting to slowly move up to dust his chest.<br />
<br />
The two men were suddenly snapped out their horny reverie by a snapping branch, and their eyes went wide as a massive wolf-man stepped out of the underbrush with a grin on his face and a dripping erection pointed right at them. Intense pheromones were dripping off of him as he stepped closer, admiring his handiwork.<br />
<br />
“Hello there,” Kenneth said as he saw the two transforming men, who could only stare as they continued to uncontrollably beat themselves off. “Name’s Kenneth. You might say me and my friends are in charge around here… And I’m looking for some recruits.”<br />
<br />
Kenneth strode forward and gently stroked Eric’s chest, letting short brown fur spring up at his touch. “My followers will be the providers for this island. Farmers, hunters, fishermen,” he whispered as his paws roamed all over Eric’s transforming body. “You shall be a farmer, working the land and bringing forth its bounty. But to do so, you will need to change. No more sneaking off and shirking your duty. Only when you have worked until sundown and your body is weary may you rest.”<br />
<br />
Eric resisted for a moment, but soon he found himself nodding along to Kenneth’s words. As he accepted this, his body seemed to stretch, growing taller and wider as his frame packed on pounds of muscles in a moment. His legs inflated until they were nearly three times larger around than they had been before, and his feet ached for a moment as his toenails grew into heavy hooves. His arms and shoulders ballooned up likewise, until they were so powerful that they nearly rivaled Kenneth’s fellow Exemplars in strength. His hair grew longer and longer down his back, creating a mane of flowing hair that blew in the wind. In the end, Eric had grown into a massive specimen of a man, nearly seven feet tall and packed with muscle.<br />
<br />
“A horse, suited to work the fields from dawn. That is what you shall be,” Kenneth whispered as Eric’s massive hose of a cock sprayed its load onto the ground and a shrill neigh bursting out from between his lips. He was a horse from the waist down, with short fur and powerful equine legs, although a pair of thin horse ears also poked out from under his mane of hair. “At least, you shall be after nightfall, when we make you complete.”<br />
<br />
With that, Kenneth turned to Lee, who was shaking, not with fear but with anticipation. Anticipation as to what this hulking, masculine, and downright sexy beast was going to do to him. Kenneth smiled kindly as he leaned in to plant a kiss on Lee’s lips, his wolf tongue slipping deep into Lee’s mouth. Lee let out a moan of pleasure as he felt his teeth beginning to grow and sharpen, and his tongue likewise grew longer as it entwined with Kenneth’s. As their lips parted, Lee’s longer tongue slipped out of his mouth and he panted like a canine, which was exactly what he was fated to become. His ears tugged themselves up the sides of his head, until a pair of pointed and furry wolf ears topped his head as well. All the while, fur continued to spread up and down his body as well, coasting his arms, chest, and legs with a thick pelt of soft fuzz. He felt his muscles growing lean and powerful as his body stretched, growing tall and strong like his master… his packmate.<br />
<br />
“You are growing so beautiful,” Kenneth cooed into Lee’s new wolf ears. Kenneth’s soft paws reached down and teased at Lee’s throbbing cock, which was still begging for release. “I shall be your alpha, and you my beta. My fellow hunter and favored lover.” The words ‘alpha’ and ‘lover’ echoed again and again in Lee’s head, until they were no longer simply words but had become an undeniable truth. His alpha was the strongest and most powerful hunter on the islands, and as beta he would be the second-in-command. Lee smiled, his newly pointed teeth a match to Kenneth’s wolfish grin.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Lee said, and he felt his cock buzz with pleasure as it blasted every remaining drop of human cum out of his body, leaving his balls empty and ready to refill with wolf seed. He moaned in pleasure as his whole body shook, giving in to the power that was changing him and feeling a thick and furry wolf&#39;s tail burst from his his spine and wag happily behind him as he gazed adoringly at his alpha. He collapsed with exhaustion next to Eric, with both men panting after how tiring their transformation had been. <br />
<br />
Kenneth smiled and seated himself across from them, preparing himself to complete their transformations alongside the others once night fell. With a good group of followers to assist them, perhaps the possibility of rebuilding this civilization would not be as difficult as they had first thought…</p>
