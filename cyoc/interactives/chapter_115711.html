<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ms. Special went back to her desk, and waited patiently until the rest of the students came into class. When all twenty students were in their seats, riding the phalli bareback, she began the lesson. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you all are bright eyed, new freshman, and as this is the first day of classes, you should know our school received a very generous gift from an anonymous donor. The money was asked to be specifically used for Impregnation 101. As such, we have flown in from 5,000 miles away, a very special guest with us today.&quot; She opened the classroom door to let in a very handsome, 6&quot;1 man in a navy silk business suit. He exuded power and confidence, and as a result of his presence, he caused two freshmen girls to orgasm into inseminated bliss. <br />
<br />
&quot;J.T. Moneybanks is of the top ten of the fortune one hundred in our hemisphere,&quot; Ms. Special went on, as she pointed her chalkboard stick to a powerpoint slide behind the gentleman guest. &quot;He has risen to the top of the financial sector not only for his intelligence and persuasion, but also for an unusual and rare genetic factor that he possesses.&quot; A classmate started mewling in orgasmic bliss, and her eyes bulged as her belly blossomed during the presentation. Ms. Special politely ignored the students unintentional interruption, and proceeded to touch the power point wall with her stick, allowing the slide to move on, showing a photograph of the well known symbol for DNA, and an unfamiliar swirly symbol, added next to it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Scientists were shocked when they found him. Before his rise to fame and fortune, he was a normal gentleman, gathering a few quids here and there at the impregnation donation bank. They noticed a strange correlation between the bank he donated at, and the mothers who swelled there. You see- J.T.&#39;s DNA is truly unique. He carries a genetic mutation that allows women to gestate 50X faster than the normal rate. At the sperm bank, all 200 women who were inseminated with his lineage fell pregnant with twins. It was a miracle for the scientific community. As I&#39;m sure you all know, this makes J.T.&#39;s sperm worth hundreds of thousands of dollars per spill. Though, sadly, because of red tape from Hetro Studies, and blocked funding from the Genetics community, none of the classes will become pregnant with his twins- all of you will be having normal births, with a single child in your bellies. All of you are experiencing faster than normal rates of pregnancy, thanks to Mr. Moneybanks, and the gene splicing discoveries from our DNA Engineering department down in our sister school in Dallas.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the teacher went on to discuss more of her powerpoint lecture, Electra stopped listening, as she was distracted and petrified in a lusty gaze. For some reason, she just couldn&#39;t stop staring at the handsome guest. She glanced back at her peers, and noticed they all fell silent and stared longingly as if though felt the same. <br />
<br />
She wrote a note for her friend, Lemon, and sneakily passed it behind her along the row, all the way to the back. <br />
<br />
Lemon read silently, <br />
<br />
&quot;He must be one of those Alpha Males all the Ancient Mythology majors keep talking about.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lemon quickly wrote back on the same note, <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn! We&#39;re so unlucky, E. <br />
What kind of work does a woman have to do to afford to have sex with him? <br />
I&#39;d love to get a piece of that and get his twins in me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The note discreetly came back up to Electra. She scribbled more words, a little longer this time, and without looking behind her, handed it back to the classmate behind her. She didn&#39;t see J.T. casually walk over their row, and grab it at the angle the student would have picked it up from. He gracefully put the note in his pocket, went to the water stand at the back of class, and poured himself a cold, refreshing cup of H2O. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Special, does your class know my relationship with the donor of the 10 million Quid your classroom has received?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize, Mr. M, our headmaster kept everything related to the donation and your special guest invite completely under wraps. I didn&#39;t even know a celebrity would be in our midst until this very morning!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite alright,&quot; he said as he sipped his drink. &quot;Ladies, I&#39;m sure you know I wouldn&#39;t normally have time to come to a small high school gathering, as I&#39;m a busy man.&quot; He flicked on the lights, and walked up to the front of the classroom. &quot;Times are changing. The larger metropolitan areas are becoming more backwards and elitist, thanks to overcrowding and a lack of occupational opportunities- though I&#39;m sure you all know this isn&#39;t the case at all anywhere else in the entire world. Unfortunately for me and my close friends, everyone wants to live in The City, and The City is where you go to make it big. My CEO and colleagues back home have insisted I change my lifestyle. After five years of constant bickering and political challenges, I have seen the validity of their ways. I&#39;ve come here not only to be your Impregnations Studies special guest, but for the next month I have also come to inseminate a few exceptional girls here and there, and more importantly, to bring home a bride.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls in the room, Ms. Special included, all gasped at this confession. Bridal talk was completely unheard of after the Great Experiment of 2025. With a lack of men to inseminate the disproportional amount of women in the world, the government propaganda strongly enforced and brainwashed a cultural shift to propagate as many people as possible. Primal urges and polygamous sex became the social norm, and matrimony got thrown out as completely backwards and dangerously taboo. <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand you all have been classically trained a little differently than this information I&#39;ve just revealed. The donor is a very dear friend of mine. He has specifically given so much generosity to your class at my request, and he and the headmaster know what I have to do. The headmaster mentioned this course is a freshman prerequisite for all females to graduate from the academy. Don&#39;t worry- those of you who don&#39;t wish to stay in this course, who are afraid of the social implications of becoming a wife- we&#39;ve set up a waiver so you will be transferred to Pornography, and to join the impregnation fetish division of that department.&quot; <br />
<br />
Half of the students started whispering to each other, while a few others started texting their friends the scandalous news. The bell rang just as the gossip got louder. &quot;Well, that&#39;s all for today ladies. Don&#39;t forget your new maternity outfits- don&#39;t want to get impregnated again just before getting to your dorms!&quot; They shuffled out, taking a grey smock dress with them. As Electra and Lemon were one of the last to leave, J.T. read the last note that Electra wrote for her friend- <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you could get his twins- but you&#39;d have to work five years to afford them. If I could get his cock in me, I&#39;d be the happiest woman on earth. Did you see his bulging outline? His pheromones are working the whole class- even Ms. Special. It&#39;s no wonder he costs hundreds of thousands- I bet that cock is super addicting to ride, and any girl who has it would never need anyone else.&quot; <br />
<br />
After he read the note, he looked up at Electra. She saw her note in his hand, blushed, and briskly walked as fast as her huge waddling tummy could let her out of that class. <br />
