<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I had intended this evening to &#39;lure you into my arms&#39; with dinner and maybe a little Netflix on the couch,&quot; said the mermaid, half seriously. &quot;But now I think I need to take you down to Muir Oigh&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
John was intrigued. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just this cozy little Irish Pub nearby where various species can drop their disguises and glamour-spells and just let it all hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Given that Erin was still sitting across the table from John completely topless—no, wait, check that, she had a tail below the waist, not clothes, which meant that she was in fact completely nude—he wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make of the possible double-meaning. Then something else clicked. &quot;&#39;Erin&#39;. Ireland. Of course, I should have guessed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin smiled and nodded. &quot;Oh, yeah. I&#39;ve got lots of Irish in my background. You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than a little.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Funny that the two of us have such English last names; but they do change over time, don&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded and fished off his own tea. It was some kind of Japanese green tea; pretty good, and it went well with the sashimi. &quot;Do you want to head right out, or hang here for a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin glanced over at the couch. Actually, it was more of a longing gaze. And, John realized, she was also fiddling nervously with the chopsticks and empty teacups. For such a forward creature, she sure was being hesitant about taking this date to the next logical step. Not that John disagreed; in fact, he was probably even more anxious than she was about the possibility of things getting physical. His track record of late had been nothing short of abysmal, with each new date proving even more psychotic than the last, until now; and now, his date had a frickin&#39; fish-tail.<br />
<br />
John was a red-blooded American male. He was intensely curious about how exactly *that* was going to work. But he was also a gentleman, and he would let Erin broach the subject in her own time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; said Erin at last, &quot;that the more pints of Guinness you put in me out *there*, the more I&#39;ll be inclined to get cozy when we come back *here*. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
As it turned out, John never had to play the role of the errand-boy; Erin simply told him to &quot;say goodbye to the girls for now&quot; before tying her seashells back on; after which, she was able to stand up from the table. Muir Oigh&#39;s pub was a fair few blocks away, but it was a lovely night for a stroll. A little chilly out, perhaps, but not so much so that John had even brought a jacket with him; and Erin quite naturally wasn&#39;t bothered by the cold at all.<br />
<br />
As they moved down the street, John walking normally and Erin doing her inexplicable slithery jiggle-hoppity-flop motion, John couldn&#39;t help but be amazed, yes, at the wobble of Erin&#39;s feminine curves, but also at the fact that he was the only one they passed who even seemed to notice. John and Erin drew only ordinary glances from the people they passed. But guys didn&#39;t even stare after Erin the way one might have expected them to stare at even a fully-clothed woman as attractive as she was. Based on that, John was quite certain that nobody else besides him could even perceive the fact that the mermaid was only barely clothed, never mind see her fishtail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder why I&#39;m immune to your people&#39;s perception filter,&quot; John commented offhandedly, once they were more than halfway to their destination.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been wondering about that myself,&quot; said Erin. &quot;It could be that you have a magical talent. Or some latent psychic ability. Any family history of ESP? Houses haunted by dead relatives? That sort of thing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm. Then you must just be unusually perceptive for a human,&quot; concludes Erin. &quot;You see truth. That&#39;s a good trait for a writer *or* a scientist to have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might just be the nicest thing a girl&#39;s ever said to me on a first date.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
Muir Oigh&#39;s proved to be every bit the picturesque and quaint little pub that Erin promised. A fine and well-maintained bar; lots of wood paneling and old-world decoration; black-and-white photos in frames, and hundred-year-old advertising posters; intimate little tables and chairs in the quiet corners of the main room; and even some easy-chairs arranged around a fireplace. The fire was lit, roaring and cheery; and a red Irish setter was curled up on the rope-rug in front of it.<br />
<br />
There were maybe ten people in total in the pub this evening, staff and patrons included. The bartender appeared to be a normal human guy, but one of the waitresses was a mermaid like Erin, while the other had pointed elfin ears. Seated at the bar were two more mermaids, and seated *on* the bar was a quartet of leprechauns singing a slow and moving rendition of &quot;Galway Bay&quot; in harmony. Apart from that, only one of the tables was occupied, by a human-looking woman and a goblin-like creature (seemingly male) that John wasn&#39;t able to identify on sight.<br />
<br />
The leprechauns&#39; singing halted briefly when John and Erin entered. John got a few stink-eyed looks, but most of the pub&#39;s occupants seemed to recognize Erin, and so nobody made a scene or anything. &quot;Welcome back,&quot; said the barkeep from behind the bar. &quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Murph, meet John. John, Murph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clancy Murphy,&quot; he clarified. &quot;I&#39;m the owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice place,&quot; John commented. &quot;I didn&#39;t think a human would own a place like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Murph smiled knowingly. It must have been a question he got a lot from newcomers. &quot;Mom was mer. Dad was half-fairy. It&#39;s just how things go sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; said John. &quot;Well, nice to meet ya.&quot; He started the evening off by ordering a generous round of pints and shots for himself and his date, and Erin pulled him over to the chairs by the fireplace.<br />
<br />
&quot;This,&quot; she said, petting the dog behind its ears, &quot;is Seamus. He&#39;s a sweetheart. I&#39;d adopt him in a heartbeat if anything ever happened to Murph.&quot; The setter opened one eye, saw that it was Erin petting him, and then closed it again and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Next, John tried his hand at scritching the pooch&#39;s ears. &quot;Who&#39;s a good doggo . . . &quot; (No reaction from Seamus.) &quot;Wow. Deep sleeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like old dogs,&quot; says Erin. &quot;They&#39;re low-key. It&#39;s relaxing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young couple knocked back a few pints and then, over shots of Jameson, struck up a very rousing conversation about the magical world; its demi-human, chimerical, and outright monstrous inhabitants; and even a little bit about magic, witchcraft, psychic abilities, and ancient Atlantean super-tech.<br />
<br />
At one point, the mermaids at the bar started to sing a lovely, harmonizing rendition of &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot; that Erin couldn&#39;t help but join in with. Her voice was every bit as siren-like as John could have expected from a mermaid. He was enthralled. Then Murph and the leprechauns drew John into one of the few Irish pub songs that he knew, &quot;The Parting Glass.&quot; And, since the drinks were also starting to run low by that time, John and Erin decided that that would be a good cue to call it quits for the evening and head home.<br />
<br />
The goodbye was warmer than the welcome, now that John was a known quantity at the pub. There was laughter and even a bit of applause from the two mermaid barflies when John and Erin stumbled back out onto the sidewalk, arm-in-arm.</p>
