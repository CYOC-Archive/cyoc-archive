<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In his exploration of the numerous options available, Chris noticed the one which read “Domesticated Dog”.   Chris smiled. He loved dogs, especially Labrador Retrievers for their intelligence and loyalty as well as their playful and friendly nature; especially with children.<br />
<br />
Chris thought back to the time when he (her at the time) and Travis attended their family&#39;s reunion and one of their relatives brought their dog, a yellow lab along with them to the party. Chris(Crystal) thought that it was the most handsome looking dog that he(she) had ever seen and spent most of the afternoon playing with their relatives pet; throwing a ball for the dog to fetch, giving it belly rubs and letting it lick his (her) face affectionately. From then on, Chris (Crystal) dreamt of owning one. However, Chris (Crystal) later found out that purebred Labrador puppies were pretty pricey, and with most of Travis&#39;s paycheck going toward paying bills, buying groceries, and paying for the necessities; they couldn&#39;t afford to buy one at the moment. But Travis did make a promise to Chris(Crystal) that he would get him (her) a puppy when he got his bonus around Christmas time. While his cat, Tammy was nice, and he loved her nonetheless, Chris had always been more of a dog person at heart. But with the help of the computer program, Chris could actually become the dog that he had hoped to someday own.<br />
<br />
Hitting &quot;Ctrl-F&quot; on the keyboard to bring up the program&#39;s search function and typing the name of the species he was looking for in the textbox, he found the Labrador Retriever option and selected it. Upon doing so, Chris was presented with a new program window. In this window, there was a slider with a movable bar that could be moved from left to right and right to left. The line along which the bar traveled had percentages at both ends; the left side read 0% and the right side read 100%. At the moment the bar was all the way on the left side at 0%.<br />
<br />
After reading the instructions in the window, Chris learned that by adjusting the slider he could choose how much of him would become a dog. <br />
<br />
As Chris realized what this meant, his face lit up. If his understanding of the instructions were correct, then by simply setting the slider to a certain percentage he could turn himself into something that was both dog and human. This would allow him to become a Labrador and still use the computer to become human again! <br />
<br />
The knowledge of this eased Chris&#39;s mind as he started to adjust the slider bar.  &quot;I want to be ath muth of a dog ath poththible&quot; Chris said to himself as he set the bar at 75% &quot;There, that thhould be enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
After making sure that everything was set the way he wanted and that the &quot;Aware&quot; option had been selected, Chris moved the cursor to the &quot;Start&quot; button and clicked on it to begin the transformation. The boy then dropped down from the chair and then positioned himself in front of the mirror to watch the changes unfold.  <br />
<br />
Chris watched his naked reflection with bated breath, looking for the first signs of any change. &quot;I wonder what will thange firtht?&quot; he wondered excitedly.  Then he started feeling the familiar tingling sensation build inside him, making him giggle, &quot;Heh heh, it tickleth!&quot;.  The transformation was starting!<br />
<br />
After feeling the tingle move to his fingers, the boy held his hand up in front of his face to examine it. Chris watched as his neatly trimmed fingernails began to grow.  Darkening and curving, his nails took on the appearance of claws as they grew longer and pointed. When he felt the same tingling enter his toes, Chris peered down at his feet; he stuck out his foot and wiggled his toes as his toenails shifted before his eyes, their pink color gradually changed to black as they grew longer, thicker and took on a very clawlike appearance. &quot;Oh wow!&quot; He exclaimed as he examined his fingers and toes with great fascination, each one of them tipped with a black claw &quot;Thisth isth amazing! Oh, I can&#39;t wait to sthee what it doesth to me next!&quot;. He didn&#39;t have to wait long as the same tingling he was feeling in his fingers and toes started manifesting in his ears.<br />
<br />
In the mirror, Chris watched as his ears moved up on his skull before they began to change as well. At first they changed in shape, becoming rounder and wider while also getting larger and broader in size, giving the boy an almost comical appearance. &quot;Hee hee,&#39;&#39; Chris giggled seeing himself with such big goofy looking ears &quot;I oook stho funny!&quot;.  Then the tops of both ears began to stretch upwards, growing taller while their tips became pointed. They reminded Chris of the ears of elves in the many fantasy movies that he and Travis had watched together...only his were much bigger, and were getting even bigger still! Chris&#39;s ears kept stretching and growing until they stood tall and stiff, past the top of his head. Then suddenly, both of his ears lost the rigidity that had allowed them to stand upright. They then flopped forward with their tips now dangling down towards the ground, resembling those of the breed he was becoming.<br />
<br />
Chris couldn&#39;t resist the temptation and reached up with his hand and flicked one of them with a clawed finger. He watched it wobble a bit before the boy smiled and quickly shook his head around, making his both ears flap about before stopping and laughing at the sight of his reflection in the mirror until the familiar, pleasant tingle drew the brown-skinned youth’s attention elsewhere on his body.<br />
<br />
When he felt a tingle just above the crack of his butt, Chris turned his upper body and looked over his shoulder, attempting to see what was happening back there, unsuccessfully. He then turned around so that his back was facing the mirror, and he turned his upper body again to look back so that he could see his bottom in it. Chris could see in the mirror that a tiny, little nub had appeared above his round, little buns.  Chris reached back to feel it. But then as if responding to the touch, the nub began pushing out from his backside stretching and increasing in length. The boy watched as it grew longer and longer and knew exactly what was happening “I&#39;m growin&#39; a tail!” He squealed with glee as he watched his newly grown appendage reach its full length and start to wag, much to his delight.<br />
<br />
It was the tingling in his mouth that prompted Chris to turn back towards the mirror.  He leaned close to it and opened his mouth to look at his teeth.  The boy watched as all of his teeth grew sharper, while his parted lips gradually grew darker.  As he continued to look on as his teeth and lips gradually became something less human in his reflection, Chris noticed that the skin on his nose had started changing color too and turning pitch black. The young lad reached up with his hand to feel it and found it felt damp to the touch.<br />
<br />
As he drew his hand away from his nose and held it in front of his face, Chris could see that his claws had sunken into his fingers. Then what happened next caught him by surprise as he watched the underside of his fingertips puffed up and bulged while the color of the skin darkened. At the same time something similar happened to the palms of his hands as the light colored flesh bubbled and swelled up into large and pillowy, black colored rounded heart shaped pads while smaller, bean shaped ones formed on each of his fingertips. Then all ten of Chris’s padded digits lengthened a bit while his palms widened leaving the boy with a pair of paw-like hands.  <br />
<br />
Chris had barely a brief moment to examine them when he felt his center of balance suddenly shift. Looking down at his feet, he saw that they too had begun to change drastically. The heels of his feet began to elongate, forcing him to stand on the balls of his feet to maintain an upright position. His toes shifted, the baby toes on both feet shrunk and were absorbed into his feet. The remaining eight of them shifted in size, shape, and length with both big toes getting shorter matching the length of the fourth toe on each foot while the second and third toes changed to matching lengths; each one of them becoming stubby and more inhuman. Then similar to what had happened to his hands, as a portion the pink colored skin on the soles of his feet swelled up in tandem with the bottoms of his stubby looking toes while darkening into black colored pads. Meanwhile, Chris&#39;s heels stopped stretching, having become hocks; his thighs thickened as their muscles grew and his legs began to appear more digitigrade, similar to the hind legs of a dog but capable of supporting his weight and allowing him to walk on two legs while also increasing his height a few inches.<br />
<br />
As Chris continued to peer down at his still changing feet, watching them as they expanded and shifted into canine paws, one particular body part caught his attention when it began to rise up and entered his line of sight...his penis. Shifting his focus to his hairless little privates as the tingling started to manifest there, Chris looked on as his prepubescent member began to rise as if he were getting a hard on…however that was not the case. Despite how it may have looked, Chris was not experiencing any arousal or sexual stimulation from down there, other than the pleasant tingle of the metamorphosis that he was undergoing, his stubby little organ remained soft and within his foreskin as it brought itself to stand erect with its tip pointing up at his face and resting against the smooth skin of his belly. “What isth happening to my petew?” The confused five year old asked himself before his brown eyes widened in shock as he watched his foreskin suddenly and seamlessly meld with the skin of his pubic area.  “Oh my! It lookth tho weird!” Chris said as he reached down with his paw-like hand and felt his boyhood, hidden inside what was clearly an animalistic sheath. That&#39;s when the tingling in his genitals intensified. The boy felt the outlined shape of his concealed penis shift beneath the pads of his fingers, its mushroom shaped tip changing and becoming into something thinner and more slender. It was curiosity that led the boy to push down the skin at the opening of his sheath with his finger. He gasped in surprise when a bright red pointed tip emerged.<br />
<br />
With his gaze still fixed downward, Chris observed as six small nubs appeared along the length of his round belly, in pairs running from his ribcage down to his waist. Dark colored rings formed around each nub, before they expanded into extra nipples.<br />
<br />
“Wow! thisth isth getting intense!” the boy managed to get out before his speech was impeded by his tongue which had suddenly expanded and grew too long for his mouth to accommodate. Chris viewed himself in the mirror with his tongue hanging out from his mouth as his face began to change, his head grew broader as his nose and mouth pushed out into a square canine muzzle while his lips thinned and turned into jowls.  Then finally the short black hair on the top of his head shortened and turned into fur which quickly spread across his entire body, covering him from the top of his head, down to his paws, and the tip of his tail in black fur.<br />
<br />
It was at that point that the transformation ceased. Chris looked into the mirror to see himself, what stared back at him was neither human nor animal but a rather a perfect combination of both. The cute little boy had transformed himself into an anthropomorphic Black Lab puppy! “Oh my goodness!!!” he cried “I’m adorrrrable!”, his voice was the same as it was when he had been human, but he had lost his lisp however once in while his “R’s” would be emphasized by a very puppylike growl. Chris was over the moon, he had become his favorite dog and better still he had the ability to change himself back into a human whenever he wanted to, having retained human-like hands complete with opposable thumbs. The young pup continued to check out his new form in the mirror, wagging his tail and barking happily to himself, completely and utterly amazed at what he had become. “This Progrrram’s absolutely amazin’!!!” exclaimed Chris as he felt his soft, roly poly body with his hands and he pondered his next course of action.</p>
