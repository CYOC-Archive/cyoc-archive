<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan and Archer stared at each other in wonder. Dan was marvelling at the giant boy in front of him, 20 feet tall, hand on his hip, crouched a little,his huge face filling up the window. Archer in turn was looking at the tiny man, thinking how small he now looked, how small everything looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re huge Archer.&quot; Dan said at last. Archer laughed, the sound louder and deeper than it should be.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I am.&quot; He stood up again to full height and stretched. Dan could see the boy&#39;s clavicle through the thin t shirt, each was bigger than his own thigh bones, easily. He had to admit to himself, the comparison turned him on, knowing this boy was so much bigger and no doubt stronger than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what happened, but I&#39;m very happy about it! I can see right to school from here, though I think my football is too small for me now!&quot; Archer seemed so happy, it made Dan smile how much he was enjoying this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha its weird my clothes grew with me! These are the only ones that will fit me now!&quot; Archer tugged at his t shirt a little. Dan&#39;s mind wandered, realising that even the boy&#39;s socks would be big enough to use as a makeshift sleeping bag if need be. It would have been interesting if it had only affected the boy and not his clothes. Dan blushed at the thought. One more blast would be insane... totally wrong... totally....<br />
<br />
While Archer was looking back out towards school he sneakily raised the ray and fired. Just a quick blast, a quick 1 second blast. And just as quickly he hid the gun again.<br />
<br />
Archer turned back smiling. His face changed a little. &quot;Oh... it&#39;s happening again! Yes! Yes!&quot; In his exuberance the boy jumped a little and landed with a loud thud.<br />
<br />
Dan smiled knowingly and watched with baited breath.<br />
<br />
Archer began to inch upwards again. This time though it seems the ray had figured out he only wanted to grow the boy, subconsciously at least, and so he marvelled as the tan skin of his lower stomach began to show more and more as he grew. The boy now was reaching the height of the building, Dan was face to face with the boy&#39;s navel, now exposed and looking like a nice place to curl up inside. He continued for a few more seconds... now he was face to face with... well the boy&#39;s giant... the bulge from the now tight shorts left nothing to the imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow! I&#39;m bigger than the house!&quot; Archer crowed loudly above. Even leaning forward Dan couldn&#39;t see passed the boy&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re giant!&quot; Dan called up. Moving impossibly fast for something so big the boy crouched down, resting his buttocks on his heels, his face even bigger and impressive than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am aren&#39;t I&quot; Archer beamed. &quot;But...&quot; Archer shifted about uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Dan asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to pee!&quot; Archer, well whined is the wrong word, it was too deep to be a whine. Dan blushed again and gazed down at the bulge in the now tight shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well erm...&quot; Dan thought the process of this through quickly. Should he shrink him down? Or tell him to just go, but then... that much pee... he had a weird idea, one that would no doubt go wrong.... &quot;Hang on!&quot; Dan ran into the flat and then appeared at the window to the left, swinging it as wide as it&#39;ll go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Archer.... if you need to, erm, my bath? Might work? But you&#39;d need to... and I&#39;d need to aim it for you....&quot; Dan was beet red at this point.<br />
<br />
Archer was mulling this over, he felt a flash of embarrassment, but shook it off. He was a giant! He was no doubt bigger down there than anyone! No need for embarrassment at all. He nodded and stood up. &quot;If you&#39;re sure Dan.&quot; He said down at the window, unbutton and pulling down the tight zip. His white underwear shone out at Dan at eye level.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden a huge fleshy pillar hit Dan in the chest knocking him down onto his ass. He looked up at the boyhood with his mouth gaping. It was easily 3 feet long, almost as thick around as he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you OK?&quot; Archer asked concerned, his cock shifting about gently as he was peering down at the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... yea, just knocked me over, it&#39;s fine.&quot; Archer grinned at that thought, he&#39;d knocked over an adult with just his dick!<br />
<br />
Dan got up and gripped the huge cock around, just under the head and tilted it downwards to the bath, he aimed it at the plug but damn it looked like it would lie in the bath comfortably on its own. He held it firmly, trying his best to ignore the slightly deep &quot;hmmm&quot; from outside. &quot;OK, go but try to hold back a little!&quot; Dan shouted back.<br />
<br />
Archer concentrated as hard as he could, gentle, gentle. And then he let his bladder go. The feeling for Dan was amazing, he could feel a tremor increase as he held on, until finally the dam broke. A pale yellow stream hit the tiles above the bath with enough force to crack a couple. Dan was having to hold on with all his strength to try to aim the mammoth cock. The stream pulsed and the calmed down to a steady, deafening very acrid smelling pour. It was like pouring buckets and buckets into the bath, it was starting to fill up! Dan was beginning to panic a little!<br />
<br />
Just as the bath was reaching it&#39;s capacity the stream came to a dribble and then stopped. Without really thinking it through, Dan released an arm and pulled the ray out of his pocket, he aimed and fired at the bath filled with pee, the beam shot out and hit the pee, holding down for a few seconds. He watched it shrink and shrink until it dribbled down the drain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats better!&quot; Archer said happily outside. As Dan took hold firmly he shook the pendulous cock a few times. A few large drops splashed into the bath again and flowed away. Then Dan felt something else. More? No... this pulse was more heartbeat like.... oh!</p>
