<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ironically, Pablo knew those who employed brainwashed catgirl maids in their business, and were also sick to death of people thinking that sex was what they were meant for  &quot;If they were for sex, I&#39;d have hired brainwashed living love doll foxes.&quot; <br />
<br />
One accounting firm had slowly replaced all their employees with brainwashed cat girl maids... and when the last CEO died, the cat girls simply hired another brainwashed cat girl maids from another company to fill the void. <br />
<br />
M&#39;ressa got a demented look in her eyes. &quot;Maybe we can kidnap the host!&quot; <br />
<br />
Pablo sighed. &quot;And get the show tons of free publicity, sympathy, and the guy would be replaced on the spot by management. He&#39;s a front man M&#39;ressa, like any gameshow host. And you&#39;d be sentenced to labor as a golem or something.&quot; <br />
<br />
M&#39;ressa was put off by this for a moment before declaring, &quot;I&#39;ll just investigate this show! How willing ARE these &#39;guests&#39; anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pablo just groaned at this one. &quot;M&#39;ressa, the HAS been investigated, several times. ALL of these shows have been!&quot; Pablo picked up the remote and began to change the channel to the rival transformation/brainwashed game shows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yee-ha! Welcome back to Brainwashed Dog-Girl Mud Wrastlin&#39;!&quot; Declared loudly a dalmatian woman wearing a cowboy hat, vest, belt, and nothing else. Oh, and a collar with her name on it, but that was to be expected. M&#39;ressa had read up on her, apparently her owner had suffered liver failure, and the dalmatian girl had been running the show &#39;in the mean time.&#39; <br />
<br />
In the middle of a pool of mud was a man and a woman in a speedo and swimsuit respectively. They were hurtling curses at each other that were mostly bleeps thanks to the censors. They brutally tried to force the other down into a submission hold, neither giving up, neither showing any mercy. <br />
<br />
All around the mud hole were men and women alike, cheering and whooping and placing bets. And besides each of them sitting up obediently was a nude dog girl with a pretty collar around her neck with a leash leading to the hand of their owner. Even at a glance it was obvious, these were not servants nor slaves, these were pets. And each of them had once been a human being. <br />
<br />
Finally the woman in the mud hole got her hips around the man&#39;s neck, and squeezed the air out of him, pushing him face first into the mud completely. <br />
<br />
The dalmatian excited counted, &quot;Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five-&quot; The audience began to chant too, including the dog girls. &quot;-four, three, two, one!&quot; And in a flash, the man in the mud hole ceased to exist. He&#39;d been remade into a poodle girl with a blue collar around her neck.<br />
<br />
The woman stood up, &quot;So whose&#39;s the beotch now, beotch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that would be me owner, obviously! Great joke!&quot; The poodle girl praised slapping a knee. &quot;Much better than my joke would&#39;ve been if I&#39;d won!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it was, come along beotch.&quot; The woman said triumphantly, leading along the dog girl to a waiting standing shower where they were both washed off, and the woman was given a leash that she connected to her new pet. <br />
<br />
On the bottom of the screen came those annoying commercials in the middle of the show&#39; everyone hated. Showing the 50th Annual Brainwashed Dog Girl Show, showing dog girl juggling, acrobatics, dancing, arm wrestling, -poetry- and a shot of the returning reigning champ, a tall husky girl covered in blue ribbon, her leash held by an old man in a wheel chair that she herself dutifully pushed along. <br />
<br />
M&#39;ressa&#39;s fur instinctively stood up, dogs, if there was a lower life-form M&#39;ressa did not know.  <br />
<br />
Pablo changed the channel again. <br />
<br />
This time showing people of all ages decked out in recreated, but very real fantasy style armor. They fought their way through dungeon sections clearly meant to be modular. Fighting non-intelligent and easily replacable and controllable monsters like zombies, skeletons, giant rats (checked for rabies of course), and the ever universal slime blob. <br />
<br />
The words, &#39;Dragon Girl Transformation Brutal Dungeon&#39; flashed in the &#39;now showing&#39; prompt.  <br />
<br />
The flashing words in the corner of the view the camera drone gave was &#39;One For All&#39;. <br />
&#39;That&#39;s interesting,&#39; Pablo thought. Mostly because people usually went for the &#39;All For One&#39; rule instead. <br />
<br />
Unlike the other shows, there was no fixed size to the number of contestants each week. It could solo or over a dozen. <br />
In All For One Rules, each person eliminated by the monsters became a kobold, until there was only one person standing (or someone reached the dragon treasure at the end), who became a dragon, with the resulting kobolds as their fanatical servers. The players were forbidden from attacking each other in this version. A step-father had robbed his family into this rule-set, saying it would ensue their family&#39;s happiness and staying together. It was a famous upset when his step-son in his cute little barbarian costume had reached the gold hoard first instead of his step-dad. The dragon whelp now a controversial figure among dragons for treating his obedient kobolds as family instead of minions. <br />
<br />
In One For All Rules, it was riskier. Everyone who could get to the end would become a dragon. But it was possible that NO ONE could reach the end, with the end result of there being no winner, and the resulting kobold clan eagerly auctioning themselves off to the dragon who willing to pay the most for them. <br />
<br />
Pablo did honestly want to see if the contestants who wanted to work WITH each other instead of against each other could make it through the dungeon, but he wasn&#39;t done making his point. <br />
<br />
He changed the channel again. <br />
<br />
This time showing a fox girl in a magician&#39;s top hat and tux with fishnet leggings. In spite of apparently having transformed two people already into happy busty women. The audience wasn&#39;t sounding impressed. With an obvious audience reaction track added to try and make the show seem more lively than it was. The magician was obviously good, but she clearly had no sense of theatrics, and the camera crew were barely trying. <br />
<br />
Pablo changed the channel once more. <br />
<br />
This was a channel straight from Japan. So it was naturally in Japanese, with English translations at the bottom. This game show was incredibly brightly colored, and it couldn&#39;t look anywhere without locking eyes with something adorable. This included the host, a little Japanese girl in a frilly dress and a magic scepter, she also had living fox ears and a matching tail. Several school girls of similar age were lined up, in various stages of transformation into foxes, the winners granted the honor of becoming magical girls and biological immortality, the &#39;losers&#39; becoming kitsune. <br />
<br />
And this wasn&#39;t even getting into the underground pirate-broadcast show involving the goblins. Less said of that one the better. That it was considered a legal gray area in THIS kinda society should say it all. <br />
<br />
Pablo changed the channel back, to find a public service announcement for the Infinite Plane of Loving Diapered Plushies and Fluffy Clouds. <br />
<br />
The diapered raccoon stuff animal on screen said in a cutie voice, &quot;We accept any and all so called &#39;parentless&#39; children, regardless of development. With our &#39;reality retcon&#39; magic, you won&#39;t even remember that you had a child... or were going to.&quot; The sunshine and lollipops plush raccoon was unable to keep the anger completely out of his words. <br />
<br />
Ever since humanity remembered that people killed while still physically connected to their parents, were, well, -people-, humanity had needed a new way prop up its farce that it had solved the over population problem with no strings attached.</p>
