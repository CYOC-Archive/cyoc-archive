<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That was when Sally had one last idea. <br />
<br />
&quot;What about bells?&quot; She asked eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bells?&quot; The old man asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes bells.&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;Bell collars to complete the looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally,&quot; Dan looked slightly pleading. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nya. Don't worry this'll be the last thing.&quot; Sally waved him off already getting into character slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot; He said, just wanting his girlfriend to be happy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we can do that in a pinch.&quot; Said the old man who quickly went out of the room and out the door to check the store's inventory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now just relax dear.&quot; Said the old woman Dan, &quot;You'll have your dearest with you. There is nothing to be afraid of. Besides, it's supposed to <br />
be a PARTY, a GAME, it's not supposed to be serious. It's not like you're walking into work or going to your wedding like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan shivered at the mention of wedding while Sally just giggled. <br />
<br />
The old man returned with two bow collars, both red to match the bow on the school uniform, both had on them a pair of modest sized <br />
gold colored bells.  'At least I won't look -too- tacky with them on.' <br />
<br />
Ever so gently the old couple put the bells onto the young couple's necks. <br />
<br />
&quot;There, all complete.&quot; Said the old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I dare say so, you two are the most adorable cat girls I've ever seen!&quot; The old woman said as if she was an expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nya. Thank you!&quot; Sally laughed. <br />
<br />
Dan was relieved when Sally decided SHE was the one who'd pay for the costumes with her debit card. It was her idea after all. And she was <br />
mature enough not to expect Dan to pay for -everything.- <br />
<br />
The two now in full costume, left the store. Dan looked at his reflection and couldn't believe how realistic it was. It was unreal. <br />
<br />
An hour later, when the couple was going through their inventory, the old man screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;DEAR?! What is it?!&quot; The old woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Curse me! Curse me! I should have marked them better!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey you're not making sense!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bells I gave them!&quot; The old man held up a box, an empty box, with several runes on the outside, &quot;They weren't mundane! They were <br />
Change Triggers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lord!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! The rest of the costumes' magic is completely inert, but those will trigger the magic in the rest like blasting cap!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know that! Quick! Let's see where they are! Maybe it's not too late!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two quickly went through two locked doors and huddled over a crystal ball, that after a brief description and some cases of mistaken <br />
identity, the old couple looked in the crystal ball. They both sighed sadly at the image.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least they're happy.&quot; The old woman sighed. &quot;We better start preparing a way for the two of them to live lives as is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might not be the end of the trouble. . . .&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no.&quot; The old woman paled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll check. But those bells might not have been single use! If we're lucky! They were! And that will be that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if they're not! That means every time they jingle close to someone in dedicated costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I KNOW! I know! This is a disaster! I might lose my license for this! And it would be right for me to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat yourself up later dear! Just check!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Dan Feldman and his girlfriend Sally MacCull drove to the costume party Morgan was holding. It was months before Halloween, but <br />
Morgan's ex boyfriend was a special effects buff and she had picked up on his passion. They didn't know how many had accepted the invite <br />
could, but anywhere from just themselves, Morgan and five or six others, to dozens, depending on how well Morgan's offer of very fancy <br />
door prizes had lured some in. <br />
<br />
The two drove to the block, and got out of the car and checked their reflections one last time. &quot;We look good.&quot; Sally said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look good.&quot; Dan retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't sell yourself short. and if any guy asks, just tell them you're with me, or that you're not the kind of guy they're looking for, that's <br />
always fun. I teased a few girls when I dressed up as King Arthur that one year.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was all in GOOD FUN, which we are supposed to be having right now remember?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan got some confident and stood tall. &quot;Right. Let's have fun.&quot; He took her hand and hand in hand they skipped down the sidewalk, and the <br />
bells jingled. <br />
<br />
What had been typical British style school uniforms a moment ago shifted colors, patterns and fabrics, shifting into cliche anime Sailor <br />
Fuku, the bell collars and the red ribbons on front the only part that remained unchanged. The sailor fuku were were no longer mostly <br />
identical in color, Sally's became the same shade of blue as her long hair, while Dan's became same bright pink as his big fluffy hair. <br />
<br />
Years melted off the both of them, going from their early thirties, to their twenties, all the way to their teens. They moved with more energy <br />
and excitement as their tails swished behind them and their triangle ears twitched as the sound of the party in full swing. They were <br />
fashionably late. <br />
<br />
She meow showing fang, and they pranced still hand in hand, their claws pulled in so they couldn't cut themselves or guests.  Dan's figure <br />
became much more fluid and graceful, her movements lithe almost to an inhumane degree.  Dan felt her breasts and nipples bouncing up <br />
and down as the wind blew against her pink hair and black ears and tail.  Sally moved only slightly less eagerly as as her tan ears and tail <br />
straighten up hear the beat of the music coming from inside Morgan's house. <br />
<br />
The shading of their bodies changed ever so slightly, becoming more contrast, more simplistic, their eyes (match the color of their hair) <br />
getting bigger as they got ski jump noses as seen in anime. <br />
<br />
Morgan's niece, dressed as a VERY cute, and VERY pretty and decidedly FRIENDLY ghost waved to them as they got close. <br />
<br />
The two stood together and made a mock salute, &quot;Daimiko Fujimoto!&quot; Said the very female very pink teenage cat girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Sayaka Matsuda!&quot; Said the shorter haired blue teenage cat girl with a little bit more reserve. <br />
<br />
&quot;Reporting for duty!&quot; They said together and then laughed breaking out of the very fake attempt at play acting military discipline. <br />
<br />
Morgan's niece Daisy smiled and nodded, looking very pretty in her pigtail blond hair and white make up and simple white dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys! You're a late! They party's already started!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ardei ga-toe.&quot; Sayaka said as Daimiko bounce along, Sayaka following behind, their bells letting out a musical almost enchanting jingle as <br />
they passed the girl in the ghost costume. <br />
<br />
The two then chatted in perfectly fluent Japanese to each other,  ~This is going to a great party Sayaka.~ Daimiko said excited looking ready <br />
to start climbing the walls. <br />
<br />
~Don't you think just showing up in our uniforms is kinda cheap though?~<br />
<br />
~Naw! It's not like there are bunch of cat girls at this party! Besides! We look cute! We're here to have fun! Maybe YOU can finally pick up a <br />
guy for once!~<br />
<br />
~Oh Daimiko. I just have fun being with you.~<br />
<br />
~Okay. That too. But guys are fun too!~</p>
