<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jermali had been living as a Ant-lady for three months now.<br />
<br />
At the beginning she tried to just enjoy herself and have fun.<br />
<br />
She wore lots of pretty dresses and ended up wearing a bit more revealing stuff, nothing too lewd. It just felt right to her. She ate lots royal honey, from the Bee traders, which made her feel incredibly energetic.<br />
She didn&#39;t have to do any work.<br />
<br />
But the fun of that started to wear down and lately she felt a little bad when seeing all the males, workers and soldiers doing hard work while she just got to sit around like some medieval royalty. <br />
<br />
Of course the Ants encouraged her to have fun and to explore her new self but Jermali started to feel like she was taking too much and not giving anything. <br />
<br />
So she asked Amira to give her a job as to feel less bad. <br />
<br />
Now she was tending the underground mushroom farms, watering them, pushing giant leaves around and cleaning the mushrooms. <br />
<br />
This had been going on for a couple days and every time she was joined by a shy male called Laroy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, get me some of that aphid-liquid stuff.&quot;, she asked him. He blushed somehow through his chitin and nodded, walking off to one one of the metal barrels to the side.<br />
<br />
Jermali noticed the looks he gave her, of course. It was obvious that he REALLY liked her. He would get so flustered whenever she talked to him. He would nervously wiggle his antennae, tap his claws on the ground and immediately get to doing anything she asked him to do.  And of course there was that mixed smell of fear, hormones and pheromones in the air. <br />
<br />
This was how Jermali also acted around women she REALLY liked when she was still some average Human dude. <br />
<br />
But what should she do with that? She had been a woman for barely a fourth of a year and the remnants of her masculinity still held on to her mind. <br />
<br />
While she admitted that she was now, or perhaps always had been, bisexual a month ago, she still didn&#39;t feel that comfortable with the idea of being in a relationship with a dude...and much less at the thought of one day being on the receiving end of a...shaft.<br />
<br />
It gave her major feelings of butterflies coupled with anxiety, nervousness and... excitement. <br />
<br />
Laroy soon returned with a bucket of aphid-excretions. She took it and spread the liquid all over. It didn&#39;t actually help the mushrooms grow or anything like that, but it made them taste better in the long run somehow. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Later that day Jermali returned to Amira&#39;s personal quarters. She was one of the few people allowed in there. It still was surprisingly...mediocre was not the right word..it was a pretty room with lots of nice furniture but not exactly something royal. <br />
<br />
A painting displayed Amira hugging her husband, who apparently was on an expedition of some kind. <br />
<br />
Jermali originally feared that male Ant-people died after mating, like actual ant males do. She felt really relieved when she learned of the actual reason for him not being present. <br />
<br />
&quot;My, my. You smell especially anxious today, Mal. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;, asked the Warriorqueen as she adjusted Jermali&#39;s hair a bit. <br />
<br />
Jermali blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... may have caught the attention of a male I have been working with. I just really don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amira put a hand on her chin and murmured,&quot;Well, do you like him back?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jermali&#39;s blush became deeper and she broke eye-contact by just not focusing on the parts of her bug-eyes which looked  forward. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...guess. He is...cute. The way he looks at me and acts around me is endearing but I am still kinda getting used to all this. Just the idea of being...close with anoth-...a guy is giving me lots of strange feelings.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I get it. You are still kinda figuring yourself out but you don&#39;t have to go all in...yet. Just ask him out on a date. If you don&#39;t like it afterall, just tell him. We teach our young to be very understanding when it comes to things like this. Also, as you used to be a male, you probably understand them better than I do and that could be a huge boon when it comes to relationships.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I get your point but I am also not comfortable with being the one who does the approaching and breaks the ice, if you know what that means.&quot; <br />
<br />
The queen sighed, &quot;Look, you are not some small man anymore. You are a two hundred and thirty centimeters tall Warriorprincess, a stunning looking one at that. You won&#39;t get approached by males in that way because you scare the fuck out of them, not only because you tower over them but...also...due to genetic memory, sadly. You get my point. Ant-males won&#39;t approach an Ant-lady of your caliber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I understand. I am gonna ask him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amira clapped her hands together and smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I am gonna get you some pretty dresses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amira left fast, leaving Jermali standing there. <br />
<br />
So, she was...gonna ask out a dude. Whew, what a thought! <br />
<br />
Poor Laroy though. She was gonna shock him badly. <br />
<br />
The queen returned and gave her a dress to put on. <br />
<br />
It was...a bit lewd honestly. It showed of her hips, thighs and the sides of her waist causing her to blush. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have something...which leaves more to the imagination?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, bug-males  find these dresses incredibly hot. They love thick thighs and huge abdomens, you have both. You should use those assets to your advantage and show them off. Your new...friend will love them. By the way, who is he?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He is called Laroy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,that sweet little guy...if I remember correctly he came with refugees from Blackwood two years ago after it was razed to the ground by the FUCKING HORNETS.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jermali jumped back, startled by Amari&#39;s sudden exclamation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, almost lost my cool there.&quot;, the queen said, combing through her hair with her claws. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Laroy was teaching some young males about history when suddenly, the subject of his desires appeared from behind him,causing him to release some...shameful pheromones. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry I didn&#39;t know you were doing something.&quot;,she said. <br />
<br />
Jermali felt akward and almost took the chance to leave but Laroy stopped her. <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, miss Jermali! Tell me what it is you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Jermali or just Mal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Mal...what do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Just rip of the band-aid&#39;, she thought to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to ask you out on a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the room was showered in a cocktail of pheromones and the younger males exchanged knowing looks. <br />
<br />
Laroy was frozen for a solid, half minute before starting to move again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...E-ugh-of-I would love to...but I am teaching these younglings about Darkburn the forth!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the younglings spoke up, &quot;No problem. Have your fun. You can tell us more tomorrow. Your lessons are always more fun than those of the caretakers anyway, you deserve some you time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you! I truly appreciate it.&quot;, he shot back enthusiastically yet awkwardly as he rubbed his wings together. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Jermali and Laroy walked towards the Ant-version of a restaurant. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off of Jermali&#39;s hips and as she noticed that she started to sway some more. <br />
<br />
&quot;So&quot;, he begann, &quot;I am kinda surprised by all this. Weren&#39;t you a straight guy some months ago? I am...exhilarated that you asked me out but I didn&#39;t take you as someone who was attracted to men.&quot; <br />
<br />
She blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have been exploring myself for some time and I have realized that I have an attraction to...men additionally to women now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t misunderstand me. I feel just as awkward as you do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You? Akward? You appear to me like a bastion of feminine confidence!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... While I like knowing that I seem like that on the outside, on the inside I am incredibly anxious about all this. I am not some casanova.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then...I will make you feel as comfortable as I can and as beautiful as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words strangely warmed her heart. She didn&#39;t know why but she gave him a light peck on the cheek causing another pheromone bomb. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
And they kept dating for weeks, flying together, eating together and even continously increasing degrees of cuddling were involved. Laroy eventually even won the heart of Jermali&#39;s pet aphid, which she creatively called Aphi. <br />
<br />
Their bond grew closer and closer as they had an incredibly awkward romance with lots of laughter and blushing. <br />
<br />
Amari gave Jermali lots of tips on how to treat a ant-male and make him feel comfortable while the younger males encouraged Laroy every time he felt too shy. <br />
<br />
With time Jermali&#39;s desire grew and grew. She would wake up in the middle of the night from the wettest and most vivid dreams she ever had. Eventually she couldn&#39;t take it anymore. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
They were laying on her bed, cuddling while Laroy read a book when Jermali&#39;s...tunnel of love started cramping. She had heard that some women could get turned on so hard that it hurt but to experience it was something else. <br />
<br />
She stood up, causing him to moan in displeasure which quickly started to turn into exhilaration as he saw her starting another one of her dances, which he enjoyed a lot. <br />
<br />
But this time, as she showed of her moves and body, she started taking off her clothes while dancing. <br />
<br />
Laroy&#39;s eyes widened as she looked at him with an awkward expression, slowly talking off her clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mal...what are you doing?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Laroy, I desire you. Please, I beg you, make me feel loved tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
She struck a wide-legged pose as her panties slid down her long legs. <br />
<br />
She looked over into her mirror. Wow, she had never actually looked at her new naked self. She was so...pretty <br />
<br />
Her old self would date her new self in a heartbeat even though she didn&#39;t have breasts, like almost all bug-women. <br />
<br />
She wiggled her hips as she walked forward, leaning onto the bed at a...fascinated Laroy.<br />
<br />
&quot;In...school we never learn how our counterparts of the opposite gender looked like naked. I imagined that your...vagina would be higher up your crotch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that too when I was a boy, before sex-ed, nothing to be ashamed of. But now, please stop and address the elephant in the room. Do you consent to cuddly, fun, lovey-time? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure if that is you or your sex-drive speaking?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Both honestly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then...I consent.&quot; <br />
<br />
She got a bit nervous again, this was gonna be it, her first time, and that as a woman.<br />
<br />
She started taking off his silk shirt and slowly worked her way through his clothes till only his shorts remained. <br />
<br />
She slid them down and there its was, his black, chitinous shaft popped out. <br />
<br />
She trembled with anxiety as she realized, yes this was gonna be inside of her. <br />
<br />
Suddenly small jolts of pleasure reached her brain from her antennae. It wasn&#39;t sexual pleasure. It calmed and soothed her. She never felt anything like that before and doubted that Humans could even feel that way. <br />
<br />
She looked up to see Laroy massage them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, if only I knew that trick earlier.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t? I do it all the time when I am stressed.&quot;, he answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I thought that was just a thing you did.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you know that you don&#39;t have to make love with me to get me to like you.&quot;, he told her while focusing on her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to,...handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled as she sensed a wave of excitement from him.<br />
<br />
She looked at his crotch, gently prodding at it to get a feel for it which he apparently found rather amusing. <br />
<br />
He was moderately large down there, by Human standards, but males like him probably had to, considering the size difference between bug-genders in this world. <br />
<br />
Jermali wanted to please him and remembering what she would enjoy as a dude, she lowered her head to his member, remembering to keep her mandibles far away from it. <br />
<br />
She was surprised as she put her lips on his tip and he gasped. <br />
<br />
She actually felt pleasure when his member touched her mouth, strange. <br />
<br />
She started gently sucking as he gave off silent moans. <br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t that bad actually. <br />
<br />
She would soon open her mouth and try to stuff him deeper inside. Oh, god. She quivered as waves of pleasure shuddered through her. Yes, she felt actual, strong sexual pleasure when giving head. That must have been an Ant-girl thing. <br />
<br />
She hugged him and touched him all over with her four arms  while his massaged her antennae and back. <br />
<br />
She continued taking him as he lovingly looked into her eyes. Yes! That was all she wanted and still lacked till he came, love! <br />
<br />
Soon he started erratically thrusting into her and Jermali squirmed as her first female orgasm drove into her body.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, I don&#39;t think you want my essence  in your mouth!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Jermali couldn&#39;t stop herself which she  soon regretted as the uncomfortable taste of his sperm touched her tongue. She tried to gulp it down but the taste stayed for a while. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; , he said as she removed her head from his crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. It&#39;s my fault. Should have listened to you instead of trying the porn thing of just swallowing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She got on top of him, cuddling as their antennae intertwined and foreheads rubbed against each other. <br />
<br />
She actually did it. She gave head to a guy and liked it a lot. Her friends back on Earth, who she tried not to think about too much, would consider this incredibly funny. <br />
<br />
Soon after both of them recovered she sat up and put her thighs on the sides of his body causing him to shake in delight.<br />
<br />
She nodded as he moved his member to her opening. <br />
<br />
A quiet moan escaped her lips as he pushed deeper into her. Her walls clang on to him, massaging him. It was good that she couldn&#39;t get gravid outside of the mating season so she could enjoy this without obstruction. <br />
<br />
Her abdomen pulsed as he pushed deeper into her tight cave. <br />
<br />
They rubbed against each other as he started gently squeezing her butt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Faster.&quot;, she begged him and so he did. <br />
<br />
&quot;Deeper.&quot;, she moaned and he complied. <br />
<br />
Soon her orgasm hit and shortly after that she feelt his warm essence explode into her womb. <br />
<br />
She fell on top of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you!&quot;, she moaned exasperated. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...love you too.&quot;, he retaliated, smiling. <br />
<br />
They started cuddling again and soon after that they fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms, in bliss.</p>
