<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided to tell Phillip about my gift. I just wondered if he would believe me. I could probably make him, but I wanted to really talk to him <br />
without reality adjusting every five seconds. I excused myself to the bathroom, giving Phillip's hand a squeeze.<br />
<br />
I needed to see if I spoke to myself, would my gift work? Closing the door behind me, I stared at my reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Brad,&quot; I said to my reflection, starting with something small. I really didn't notice anything change. I pulled out my wallet. Sure <br />
enough, my driver's license said that my name was Brad.  I suddenly &quot;remembered&quot; having memories of always being called Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; I said to myself. Try for something physical. &quot;I have a second mouth that is my belly button.&quot; That's when I felt something weird <br />
happen. It felt like someone was stretching my belly button sideways and pushing it deeper into my body. The sensation stopped, and all I <br />
did was stand there, not doing anything. I slowly lifted up my shirt and looked in the mirror since my pecs were preventing me from seeing <br />
anything other than my toes when I looked straight down.<br />
<br />
I nearly gasped as I saw a pair of lips in place of my belly button. I thought about smiling with it, and sure enough, the lips parted into a <br />
smile with perfectly white teeth. My abs made dimples on both sides of my new mouth. I stuck out my new tongue out as well. That got me <br />
thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;My cock is a foot long soft,&quot; I said. I groaned as my very-not-soft cock lengthened down my leg. I quickly pulled it out. It must have been <br />
at least 15 inches. My lower tongue licked my lower lips in anticipation. I lifted my cock up and used my new tongue to give it a quick lick.<br />
<br />
The pleasure I felt was out of this world. My knees nearly buckled. I could taste my cock, and it tasted good. But I came in here for one <br />
purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;From this point on, I can mentally choose when I want what I say can change reality,&quot; I said to my reflection. Nothing felt different. &quot;I have <br />
a pig's snout, I added, not at all wanting that to come true. Nothing changed. My nose didn't twitch or turn up. It felt like normal. I can <br />
finally control it now.<br />
<br />
I put my cock away and put down my shirt. Just before I walked out of the bathroom, I said to my reflection, &quot;From this point on, Phillip will <br />
remember any changes I make to reality.&quot; I walked out and smiled at Phillip, my cock twitching a little at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you,&quot; I said, making quick strides and nearly falling into his strong arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brad,&quot; he said, kissing me on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's something I need to tell you,&quot; I began to say but be interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to tell you something as well,&quot; he said, getting a little nervous. &quot;It can't wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you can wait,&quot; I said, wanting it. He no longer appeared nervous and looked at me expectedly. So I continued. &quot;I have this unique <br />
gift, you see. I can, uh, change anything just by saying it.&quot; Phillip gave a slight chuckle. He must think I'm joking. &quot;I'm serious. But not only <br />
that, reality changes along with it so nobody notices anything different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if you said that my roommate is part chicken, it would come true?&quot; he asked, still seeming to play along with my &quot;joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he wouldn't even notice anything different,&quot; I finished. &quot;I'm not joking! I'll prove it to you. Where is your roommate now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's upstairs in his room,&quot; Phillip answered, now clearly concerned that I had lost it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Describe him to me,&quot; I said. Phillip paused for a moment before doing as I requested. According to Phillip, his roommate's name is <br />
Michael. Where Phillip is super muscular, Michael is not. His form of exercise is running, which makes him very skinny. He is relatively <br />
lazy when compared to Phillip. Michael is 5'6&quot; and weighs about 150 pounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he single?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Phillip said. &quot;He has a girlfriend named Janice. She's going to be coming over to see him within the next couple of minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then,&quot; I said, stretching my massive arms. I felt my lower mouth stretch into a smile underneath my shirt. I closed my eyes and wanted <br />
for the following changes to happen to Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you said gave me some inspiration,&quot; I told Phillip. &quot;Michael is part chicken. He doesn't have any feathers or any external body parts <br />
that would suggest he part chicken. His belly is very large, almost the size of a beach ball. He is capable of laying decently sized eggs, but <br />
only when he is aroused. The ways to get him aroused is to either stroke his dick or caress his belly. He is often nicknamed 'Hen' by his <br />
boyfriend, Jason, who happens to be part rooster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Michael, Jason does not have any external body parts that would suggest that he isn't completely human. His dick is massive when <br />
compared to Michael's. He crows like a rooster when he orgasms.&quot; I finished and looked at Phillip. He was visibly worried that the love of <br />
his life had completely lost his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't believe me, do you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you said is completely impossible!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I want to believe that you have this power but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you'll have to see for yourself!&quot; I told him. &quot;Only the two of us will notice any differences. No one else will.&quot; I then heard footsteps <br />
coming from the stairs. &quot;Here's your chance.&quot; Michael came into the room, and Phillip's eyes nearly bulged out of his head.<br />
<br />
Michael wasn't wearing a shirt. How could he though? His stomach stuck out a good two feet from the rest of his body. The skin wasn't <br />
flabby but just short of being taut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, who's your friend?&quot; he asked, gesturing to me. Phillip grabbed my hand and smiled at me affectionately, although still a little <br />
bewildered at his now rotund roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Brad,&quot; he answered, &quot;my new boyfriend.&quot; Michael's eyebrows shot up so high, they seemed to disappear in his red bangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriend?!?&quot; he repeated, clearly in shock. &quot;I thought you were going to ask out that hot blond chick at the front desk of the gym. Was <br />
she that bad that you've given up women completely?&quot; Now it was my turn for my eyebrows to rise into my bangs. I looked at Phillip. He <br />
smiled sheepishly and shrugged his massive shoulders, completely out of words to say.<br />
<br />
I looked to Michael and said only one word, &quot;Nate.&quot; Michael started beaming, and almost started laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I TOLD you, Phillip,&quot; he said proudly. &quot;Nate is a real Cupid out there. Once he matches you with another guy, you can just forget about <br />
everything else. Nate was the one who matched me and my boyfriend, Jason, together. I don't know how he knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Knew what?&quot; I asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both my parents and Jason's parents are brilliant genetic scientists,&quot; Michael explained. &quot;For some weird reason, they felt that it was okay <br />
to add animal DNA to their children. I got a hen's DNA, and James got DNA from the rooster in the same coop. It was like we were <br />
destined to be together. You should see my older brother though. He got DNA from a golden retriever bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then asked if being part animal ever got annoying, to which Michael replied with a shrug, &quot;Not really. Our animal sides don't really come <br />
out until spring, when all of the animals start getting frisky. I stop laying eggs around the middle of May, and my stomach shrinks down to <br />
a normal size. Jason's hair turns red and becomes very soft like feathers during the spring. We can barely concentrate on anything other <br />
than having sex. Just looking at each other in a certain way can get us going. Heh, my brother goes into heat and acts a little more canine <br />
than the rest of us. He emits pheromones that attract humans and dogs. I can't even count the number of puppies and half-canine, half-<br />
humans he's given birth to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have any chicks hatched from your eggs?&quot; I asked, my interest rising with every passing second.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he answered, a little crestfallen. &quot;I can't. Jason has to be rooster before I swell up like this, which hasn't been the case yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn't believe it. I had changed, not only Michael and his boyfriend directly, but also their parents' jobs, their siblings, and their entire <br />
lives indirectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost wish you could make me part animal,&quot; Phillip whispered to me. I raised my eyebrows. &quot;I said almost. I don't actually want to <br />
become part animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could change that,&quot; I whispered back, knowing all to well my eyes glinted with mischief. But Phillip looked at me sternly so I dropped it. <br />
At that moment, the doorbell rang. Michael stood up quickly despite his massive belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd be Jason,&quot; he said, heading to the door. &quot;I'll see you two lovebirds later.&quot; The door then opened and shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think those two are literal lovebirds,&quot; I stated with a chuckle before looking back up at Phillip. &quot;Now do you believe me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You GUESS so?&quot; I repeated. &quot;Fine. You have a second mouth instead of a belly button.&quot;<br />
<br />
Phillip groaned and pulled up his shirt. I knew what he was feeling and took my shirt off. His eyes sparkled when he saw my second <br />
mouth. I leaned up and kissed him with both of my mouths.<br />
<br />
After a minute, I pulled back and asked, &quot;Wasn't there something you wanted to tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Phillip said...</p>
