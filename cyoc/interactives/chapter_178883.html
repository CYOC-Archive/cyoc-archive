<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the idea of going back a toddler was tempting, I didn&#39;t really think going young too much was a good idea. It would have been difficult to pretend I was so young mentally, and I certainly didn&#39;t want to lose all the knowledge I had gained. Moving further down the island, I paid more attention to the labels. Some of the dresses were for girls, which was also slightly tempting but also discarded. No, I wanted to stay male and old enough to have some mobility.<br />
Some Cars underpants caught my attention and I looked closer. Probably for children in the first grades of school. Other research revealed a package of Star Wars training pants of roughly the same size and a folded sheet of plastic. This puzzled me for a moment, then I realized it was for bedwetting. A bed-wetters. There were also some clothes with them in different sizes. I guessed it for 3, 4 and 5 years, and then a bigger set for a kid maybe 8 or 9. Then there were some that I could wear now.<br />
Nearby I found some packs of Drynites, always accompanied by clothes of different sizes for different ages. I imagined for heavier and more frequent bedwetting.<br />
 I liked the idea of going back to wear a diapers or a Drynites under my Pj in bed ... And above all I could have become younger than my brother and thus receive the attention that was directed to him.<br />
School would not have been a problem with my current knowledge. <br />
My brother is 9 years old ... to become his little brother but without getting too young I could become 7 years old.<br />
<br />
After choosing how young to become, the choice was easier. I took the pack of Drynites and matching clothes for a seven-year-old boy.<br />
I grabbed the package and walked over to the manager. &quot;And these?&quot; He pointed to the back of the package. &quot;Here are the instructions. You can read and if something is not clear to you, just ask me.&quot;<br />
I put the box of Drynites on the counter and look at the instructions and right under the written part there were 3 photos of the diapers in the box. A Drynites like the one printed on the package, a pull-up and a simple Pampers with adhesive tabs. Drynites had &quot;bedwetting 2-4 nights per week&quot;, pull-ups had &quot;bedwetting 4-6 nights per week&quot; and Pampers with tabs had &quot;bedwetting every time the child falls asleep&quot; .<br />
I read the instructions.<br />
1. Ask your child to strip completely naked<br />
2. Ask them to put on the diaper you have chosen for him. Their design is similar to the underwear they wear, so it&#39;s easy to put on<br />
3. Once the diaper is put on, have him put on his pajamas and put him to bed<br />
4. Write on the front of the diaper, in the space provided, the age, in years, of when the child will begin to stay dry during sleep.<br />
If no age is indicated, the child will bedwetting for a minimum of 10 years.<br />
5. During sleep, the diaper will be used and the child will transform<br />
6. Don&#39;t worry about changing furniture or clothes! This new and improved diaper will make her bedroom and clothes fit his new age.<br />
Warning! When the child falls asleep, make sure his diaper is still dry and clean. If the child voluntarily pees or poops in the diaper before falling asleep, unexpected transformations can occur. Careful<br />
<br />
<br />
It was all very clear, except: Would everyone still think of me as a sixteen-year-old or will reality change? I asked the Manager.<br />
&quot;The only ones who will know about your change will be you, me, and anyone who sees you wearing your diaper and pj. If you want everyone to remember you as a seven year old boy , just fall asleep without anyone seeing you in your new pj and diaper or Drynites.&quot;<br />
Easy !<br />
It was all clear. I bought the package and went home.<br />
When I got home, my mom asked me why I didn&#39;t buy anything with my money. He mentioned how &quot;responsible&quot; I was becoming as I walked up the stairs and into my room.<br />
<br />
When I walked into my room, I made sure my brother wasn&#39;t here, locked the door and hid the package. Above the package I saw that there was a note.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have noticed that it may be difficult to explain to people who ask you why you have diapers and clothes for a young child, so I put an illusion pendant on the package. Only people who bought from my shop can see the package. Anyone else, see with your empty-handed. Have fun being the little kid of your family! &quot;<br />
<br />
Reading the note I understood why no one had noticed the package I had with me when I returned home. I had hidden it by wrapping it in my jacket, but it was quite bulky and I was amazed that no one had asked me about the package when I entered.<br />
I was about to open the package when my father knocked on the door.<br />
&quot;Jon, remember that you have to mow the weed before we go out for dinner ...&quot;<br />
I hated mowing the weed. I hoped that from tomorrow morning, and for many years, it was no longer my job.<br />
After doing the work and taking a shower, I got dressed to go out.<br />
In the living room I found my parents and my little brother waiting for me to go out all together for dinner. My little brother was jumping around, thrilled by the expectation of where we&#39;ll ever go. My parents giggled watching what the nearly 9 year old kid was doing.<br />
<br />
We went out and got into the car. My brother and I, in the back seat. Along the way I wondered if, from tomorrow, I should sit in a car seat. At seven, maybe I would be a little too old to still use the car seat ...<br />
Arriving at the restaurant, we sat down at our table.<br />
<br />
Before dinner we went to the bathroom to wash our hands, and in the bathroom I found a mother struggling with changing her baby&#39;s diaper.<br />
I was fascinated by the diaper and the thought that from tonight I would use one too.<br />
<br />
It was a nice dinner and my little brother played foolish. My parents were amused by his funny behavior, even though my father would look at me every now and then and wink at me. A small sign between the father and the eldest son, now a young adult, to say to having patience with the infantile nonsense of the 9-year-old boy at the same table.<br />
<br />
Maybe he thought I was a little fed up with Matt&#39;s antics and childish comments, but in reality, as I watched him, I was savoring the wait of only a few more hours, and after that, I will be the center of attention and cuddles of my parents.<br />
Indeed more, I&#39;ll be their seven-year-old bedwetting brat.<br />
I also wondered if Matt, who will be my big brother from tomorrow morning, would laugh at me for my bedwetting.<br />
<br />
When we got home, pretending to be tired, I immediately went to my bedroom and locked the door. It was a little too early. Both my parents and Matt were still awake, but I was too impatient and excited to opening the package I had bought.<br />
<br />
I took the package that I had hidden in the closet and opened it.<br />
As indicated in the instructions printed on the back, inside were the three types of diapers.<br />
It was time to choose, how many times a week, I wanted to wake up in a wet diaper ?</p>
