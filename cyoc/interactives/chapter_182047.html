<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina held her eyes closed, her midsection felt tight and stretched, her veins felt like fire was pumping through them, her breathing was quick and shallow, her brow gleaming with a thin layer of sweat.<br />
<br />
She had been like this since she became conscious once again, unable to talk, unable to move while the fire did its work, seeping into her muscles, her bones and her organs, for what felt like hours she endured, the flames licking every inch of her being and showing no signs of slowing.<br />
<br />
Then her eyes shot open as she felt the flames collapse in on her heart, taking in a sharp breath &quot;LINA, its ok, your ok, were still in the cave&quot; said Viki, Lina then held the sides of her head, Vikis voice echoing and loud, then everything came into focus, Viki was sat to her left, and Lucy lay by Linas feet, Sofia sat sound asleep to her right,<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been out for what I can guess to be a day, your temperature has been through the roof!, Sofia was afraid your blood was going to start boiling at any moment!&quot; Said Viki as she hugged Linas belly, but the impact happened sooner than Lina expected, and looking down she soon saw why, her belly was absolutely huge, almost every inch of her womb was filled with baby, her now four daughters all beginning to stur awake under her rubber, then Viki leaned her head in close to Linas belly &quot;hello in there little ones, Mommy is awake, you can tell her now Ava&quot; she whispered, Lina raised an eyebrow, just what was Viki on about, Avatar had something to tell her?.<br />
<br />
Lina then began to rub her extremely crowded womb with both her hands, its surface coming to life with kicks punches and rolling, Lina gave a happy sigh, at least everyone was still OK<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Ava what did you need to tell mommy?&quot; Asked Lina as she saw a baby version of Ava reach a scaly arm out to press against Linas hand, the walls of her womb keeping them divided &quot;bad news I&#39;m afraid mommy&quot; came Ava&#39;s mental voice &quot;the presence of three of our sisters have been lost, the sister to the western woods, the sister of the southern sea and the sister of the North Eastern grasslands&quot; said Ava sadly, hugging into Linas hand.<br />
<br />
Lina rubbed over her daughter, soon feeling the rest eager to get the same attention, Lina rubbed in wide circles over her belly as she tried to figure out what was going on, three pillars of reality just disappear?, but how, if they were anything like how they found Ava lina doubted that there was a living being able to kill one of them, so the theory of them being dead was out, so that only left one option &quot;the hive queen&#39;s forces must have found a way to take them&quot; said Lina to herself, Viki looking at her with wide eyes before pulling out the medallion that had sat on the pillar in the lizards mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;They must have taken theis medallions, somehow they are tied to them, wherever the medallion goes, they must be forced to follow&quot; said Viki as she rubbed her thumb over the yellow jewel in the center of the gold medallion before her eyes whent wide &quot;she&#39;s after THEM, the hive queen wants the sisters, they said themselves that they make up our reality, so what happens if you controll them?&quot; Said Viki, Lina suddenly coming to the same conclusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Controll the sisters, controll reality&quot; said Lina quietly, she then looked down at her belly, petting its stretched surface before she heaved herself up, her center if balance was way off where it used to be as she staggered forward before righting herself, her hand pressing into her back and her belly being pushed out infront of her, a heavy pressure could be felt deep in her pelvis as one of the babies head rested against it.<br />
<br />
Then Lina turned her attention back to Viki, her thumb still brushing over the medallion, she then turned to Lina with a sad smile &quot;this is how you did all those things isn&#39;t it?, with one of these&quot; said Viki as she held the medallion infront of her, Lina just looked down, unable to meet her wife&#39;s gaze, then Lina herd a groan and when she looked up Viki had her hand shoved deep within her pussy, the same hand she had the medallion in!<br />
<br />
&quot;Viki what have you done!&quot; Shouted Lina, Lucy and Sofia jumped awake from her voice as they saw what was happening infront of them.<br />
<br />
Vikis womb was swelling rapidly, the medallion imcould be seen inside spinning at a rapid pace, its surface disintigrating, Viki held her swelling womb as she let out screams of plesure, then Lina felt her belly shrinking slightly, its surface not as tight as before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnnghh!....thats it baby mmmmmm. Come to mommy!&quot; Moaned Viki as they all watched Ava materialise in place of the medallion, Viki smiled maternaly down at her womb, once again filled with a child, she then looked up at Lina and Lucy smiling guiltily at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Lina, it&#39;s just I saw what the burden of theis babies was doing to you, even Sofia would agree that you wouldn&#39;t have survived a fifth pillar in your womb&quot; said Viki, Lina turned to Sofia, who nodded in agreement, her hand clutching at her womb, and her face scrunching up in discomfort before relaxing again, Lina was going to ask if she was OK, but Sofia turned away, distracted with trying to contact Alice.<br />
<br />
Viki was now sat on the ground, Lina and Lucy sat behind her, letting her rest her head against Lucy&#39;s breasts and her back on Lina&#39;s exercises ball of a belly, she sighed with plesure as she felt Ava roll over within her, her movement causing Vikis belly to become lop sided, but she didn&#39;t care, she knew that Ava would never replace Chloey, but Ava was now Vikis daughter, her baby girl, and she would do her best to make her baby feel happy, loved and safe, she did have three mommies after all thought Viki she was now technically Ava&#39;s medallion, it was now a part of her, and now so was Ava<br />
<br />
&quot;Um girls? Sorry to spoil the moment but Nnnnnghh I don&#39;t think I can hold them in any loooooooonger!&quot; Said Sofia as she lay on the ground and her legs spread wide, her pussy beginning to bulge with the first babies head in her birth canal, then she did something that shocked everyone, she put her hand as deep as it would go into her pussy, blocking the babies exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry sweethearts but mommy needs to keep you inside for a bit longer, oooooooooh yeah&quot; Moaned Sofia as her hand sunk deeper into her birth canal, she then turned to the three wives with I sorry smile &quot;umm I can&#39;t get them past my cervix, haven&#39;t been able to for weeks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on WEEKS!?, your telling us that you&#39;ve been preventing your labour fir WEEKS!?, I don&#39;t know whether to be impressed or terrified&quot; said Lina as she waddled as fast as she could over to Sofia......</p>
