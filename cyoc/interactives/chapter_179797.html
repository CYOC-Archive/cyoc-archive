<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When they reached the food court, they were able to easily spot the rest of their friends sitting over at one of the tables. And unexpectedly, Olivia was also here, although it appeared that this was more of a coincidence than a planned meet up in her case. The 2 guys and 2 girls sitting down at the table, as well as Olivia turned to see their returning friends when Heather called out to them. The 4 at the table didn&#39;t have much of a reaction, at least when compared to Olivia who instantly saw her sister tailing right behind Melody with a quite content look on her face. <br />
<br />
Olivia ran over as quick as she could and confronted Melody. &quot;Melody, what happened to her! How is it that she part cat now? I leave the two of you alone for less than 24 hours and she already is nothing more than a pet to you now?&quot; argued Olivia. However Melody was prepared for this. She just ignored Olivia and instead squatted down and motioned for Jen to come closer to her, which Jen did without any hesitation and even rubbed up against her thigh as she walked over; just like any cat would do. &quot;Are you seeing this Olivia? This is how she wants to be. Can&#39;t you see how happy Jen is?&quot; Asked Melody while she scratched and pet Jen&#39;s body, but mainly focused on rubbing the base of her tail and behind her ears, causing Jen to begin to purr loudly and press herself up against Melody&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-is it Jen who is making this purring noise? Seriously Mel, what the hell happened here? At least just explain it to me&quot; requested Olivia, who, now that she could clearly see that Jen was not only fine, but somehow seemed to be really happy with her current role as Melody&#39;s pet catgirl, had calmed down quite a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is kind of an interesting story, but I am not sure if I want to tell you the details of it. It kind of is our shared secret, meant for only me and her to know&quot; explained Melody, who once she was satisfied with petting Jen, had stood back up. Jen however wanted more attention and proceeded to not only rub against Melody&#39;s legs, but would occasionally meow too. Whenever she did that, Melody would smirk a bit, as she knew the truth, which was that Jen was fully aware of what she was doing, but couldn&#39;t stop it even if she wanted to. <br />
<br />
Jen however, was really starting to get use to the idea that this is her life now. If she thought about it, her life now would be extremely easy and rather fun too. She didn&#39;t have to worry about anything, and could even do a lot that most people never could hope to do. Such as walking not only naked, but also down on all fours with a collar and leash around your neck, and while in a crowded mall no less; with no repercussions whatsoever. In fact, she may even be in a place to gain from this too. She also no longer had to worry about finding a job, paying bills, taxes, and even had gotten herself an owner with an amazing pair of testicles to take care of, feed, house, and love her. Jen was able to have sex practically whenever she wanted it, and given her collection of &quot;curses&quot;, which many held contradicting points that canceled each other out, or Melody&#39;s were given the priority, she could say that the loss of the majority of her humanity was well worth it. She still could even be turned back to normal theoretically, as long as Melody cursed her to do so. <br />
<br />
But for now, Jen was as content as she could be given her current situation. It wasn&#39;t all too bad when she thought about it positively. It didn&#39;t hurt that part of her now was a bit masochistic in addition to her being 100% submissive and loyal to exclusively Melody. Those personality alterations definitely make things a bit easier for her when ever she has to adjust to any of the kinky things that Melody dreams up on the spot, such as becoming her pet catgirl for instance.<br />
<br />
Or like right now. Jen watched as both her hands and feet turn into cat paws, although her feet were still stuck inside of her heels. Melody had whispered to Jen that she wants her to have cat paws, and now she does. Melody also had apparently packed another pair of heels for her, as this was likely her plan from even before they had left the house. These new, open toed heels with just a thick strap across the top of the foot and an ankle tie ribbon was all that was ment to keep the shoe on her foot. In other words, Jen could clearly see that from just above her ankle down, was now completely covered in blonde fur, and was a human foot sized snow leopard paw. Her hands and wrists were also in the same boat. She didn&#39;t think she needed the heels anymore, but the curse forced her to keep them on at all times. &#39;Well, at least I don&#39;t need to have them on my forepaws too.&quot; Jen thought to herself, noticing and accepting the mental change of how she naturally adresses her hand, and changing it to forepaws. <br />
<br />
It was then that Jen was suddenly freaked out a bit. Melody suddenly picked her up. And, she even said outloud that &quot;Jen is actually pretty lightweight for her size&quot; causing Jen to suddenly feel around 90-100 or so pounds lighter, almost instantly. She at least was light enough for Melody to carry her entire weight with just one arm rather easily.<br />
<br />
Both Heather and Olivia looked surprised at Melody. Neither felt that she should be able to lift up Jen that easily, and Heather was sure Jen had human shaped hands and feet a while ago, but now was second guessing herself on it. Olivia leaned over and whispered into Melody&#39;s ear. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you do it, but you will tell me all about ut later when we are alone, alright. She is still my little sister, so I think I at least have a right to know that much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, later though. And just play along for now or I won&#39;t tell you anything.&quot; Replied Melody. She then whispered in such a quiet voice that only Jen with her inproved hearing could understand &quot;your hands can come back like how they were. I have changed my mind about it after seeing them. Oh but your feet will stay paws for now though.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jens forepaws shifted back into her &quot;normal&quot; human hands, with the inclusion of pads on the palms and finger tips like they had been before they were turned fully into paws. Heather, who again didn&#39;t see the shift because she was looking elsewhere was yet again confused. But decided that she just should let it go and not worry about it.</p>
