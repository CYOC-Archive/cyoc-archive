<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Some fun?&quot; Asks Jeff. Emma nods and moves him out of the way. She opens the Chronivac and then specifically Jeff&#39;s profile. &quot;Since you are a mother to be now, I think your body should adjust a little to suit your new maternal needs. For starters, with twins in your ass, you should not be sitting down on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma quickly flies over the keyboard, entering her first of many edits and presses confirm. Jeff falls off his chair immediately and lands on the ground. He tries to stand up, but cannot bend his waist past about 110 degrees, meaning that he cannot stand up. &quot;What did you due to me Emma?&quot; Asks Jeff curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured since you already have the pussy and tail of one, why not give you the posture of a mare as well. You should find standing on all fours to be quite comfortable now. Oh, and since our butt babies will be out of the direct way, I can still fuck you anytime I want to. Now then, let&#39;s get your hands into hooves as well!&quot; Emma explains while getting up and picking through their sex gear pile.<br />
<br />
She finds what she is searching for and hands them to Jeff. They basically are a special kind of glove that doubles as stilts and instead of fingers, ends in horse hooves. She swaps out his current gloves for these ones as the previous ones didn&#39;t add any length. And to her delight, Jeff now is able to stand up and keep a level back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Emma... we have a device that could turn me into a complete mare if we wanted it to. So why am I still wearing this fetish gear?&quot; Asks Jeff who only now is able to get himself balanced on the new gloves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because then that&#39;s no fun. Plus this way you still have hands to do stuff with if you needed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t though since now someone has to unbind the gloves for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...right... Damn it Jeff, now my idea isn&#39;t going to work.&quot; Grumbles Emma. Jeff chuckled and Asks her to unbind his hands and let him try out an idea he just thought of to see if it suits her plans better. She agrees and Jeff quickly gets to work.<br />
<br />
Upon confirming the change Jeff&#39;s finger tips blacken and 2 of his fingers merge into their adjacent one, leaving him with 2 fat fingers and a thumb on each hand. Then they harden at the tips, becoming essentially finger hooves, and unless in use as fingers, will naturally adjust themselves to appear as similar to horse hooves as possible. Jeff also lengthened his arms to compensate the difference in height that he now has from not having the stilted gloves.  &quot;There, now unless I need to use them as hands, my hands essentially are now hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma beams seeing this, &quot;that is so awesome! I really do have the smartest girlfriend when it comes to my fetishes!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So you were being serious about only seeing me as a girl now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, you have more tits than I do and yours are bigger too. Plus I have the bigger dick here, and isn&#39;t yours incapable of getting hard now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I am not sure. I didn&#39;t make it like that specifically anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but you did make you have a much better pussy than I have, and I will always have a better dick too. Face it Jeff, our origional sex organs are now obsolete for us. Because I sure as hell won&#39;t be sticking that limp dick inside my pussy again. Partially because I don&#39;t think I could fit it inside honestly. It has become extremely tight due to a lack of use in this new reality. I can bairly shove 2 fingers into it, and honestly, my dick feels so much better anyways. So tell me, does this feel good Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma then grabs onto his dick and begins giving Jeff a hand job. To Jeff&#39;s surprise, it isn&#39;t really doing much for him. And he would rather she use her hands to squeeze milk out of his breasts instead. &quot;Umm, you can stop Emma, it&#39;s doing me nothing like you said.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right? Just accept that your the mare now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So are you my boyfriend now too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, nah, I&#39;m still your girlfriend. Girls have the better dicks according to this reality afterall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was taken aback by her logic. &quot;But then I should still be the boyfriend since boys have the better pussy.&quot; This is where Emma smiles at him. &quot;That&#39;s right, but we both know the truth, and calling you my girlfriend turns me on. Plus you yourself just said that you felt like being called Mommy a little bit ago anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t argue that point and just accepted that she had already set her mind on it being like this, plus it really didn&#39;t bother him all that much to begin with anyways. &quot;Fine, but then can we please fix my head so that I don&#39;t feel like I am breaking my neck just to look forwards all the time?&quot; Emma nods and fixes that right away for Jeff. <br />
<br />
She also does two other subtle change without telling him about it and grins. She then goes and puts on some clothes, though nothing will ever cover her throbbing errection entirely. One of her new changes made them able to be our and about naked or with minimal clothing and no one would mind it. Jeff stands there curiously, unsure as to what his girlfriend is up to. Suddenly Emma turns around and in a single fluid motion, slips a horse bit between his teeth and hops onto his back. To Jeff&#39;s surprise, she feels practically weightless to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go out for a little walk&quot; She says as she tugs on the reins. Jeff feels compelled to follow her steering and begins moving towards the door to the room. &quot;Um Emma &#39;ut &#39;id you do?&quot; Jeff asks through the mouth piece. Emma chuckles and tells him everything. &quot;Nothing much, I just may have made you able to carry me around on your back and follow my steering without question is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I really am just a horse to you now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, I would never fuck a horse. But my girlfriend? Fuck yeah. And you can admit that you are also having fun too you know.&quot; Emma tries to spurr Jeff on by pushing her heels back into his lowest pair of tits, causing Jeff to moan. &quot;Mmmm, hey, don&#39;t kick your heels into my tits! It&#39;s will be super embarrassing if I have to moan in public like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine fine, but then you better move when I want you to&quot; said Emma, hardly able to hold back her smiling face. She could smell how horny Jeff was getting, and her cock was already solid as a rock and resting on the back of Jeff&#39;s head. Emma helped get the doors for Jeff and the two of them set out for a brief walk around the block.</p>
