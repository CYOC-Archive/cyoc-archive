<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cart rolls on as you sit silent like a school boy before the master. <br />
<br />
&quot;We visit first the Angora goat barn where you can see what fine specimens we produce.&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wait, stop the cart!&quot; you burst it out and actually scared the Doctor.<br />
<br />
The golf cart comes to a halt as Thule looks at you as if maybe your sick. He motions for you to get out wouldering if one might toss breakfast and dirty his ride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to know, you never explain everything so I demand to know now!&quot; you speak your piece cause soon one might moo, squeal, or grunt.<br />
<br />
Doctor Thule sits back in his seat, arms fold over his chest he eyes you with some dissatisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Franks, Marge and Justin they came to work for you out here and when I met them as African Water Buffalo Justin knew me. Why did you change them and what of their two kids Janice and Benjamin?&quot; the battle of reasoning does now begin.<br />
<br />
Thule checks his watch and then with a sigh he begins to offer what he has decided is the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tire me, you really do nag me about what I do here as if there be some moral I'm to follow. There is no law but me! I am God here and all who come are subjects for my will and none other. <br />
<br />
The Franks both came with open hearts and plans of doing great deeds for science and mankind. They like all but me were given the first dose of my formula. It was Benjamin who angered me first his sixteen year old attitude, his seeking to learn and find out what made this place tick. He found too much right off and informed his father.<br />
<br />
Justin Franks was a good lab tech as was his wife but their kind is a dime a dozen. He got all upset making phone calls and tried to write letters then e-mail. After only four months working here they were fast becoming a real laibility.&quot; told Thule of what began the Franks ordeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;So to quite them as you'll do to me they became Buffalo, oh God the kids too!&quot; you exclaim the thought of their kids being made animals and sniuffed out was beyond all comprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, get off your high horse and look around! I have a business which makes big money. I take those who even by the world's ideals would be next to a speck of dust a nothing and once treated they leave here with purpose which will directly change the face of our world.&quot; tells the Doctor some of his reasons for being.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kids, you took young sweet nice kids and made them as animals. You cut them off from the human world, not once not a thought do you care to give for what they in time might accomplish!&quot; by this time your screaming at the Doctor and a pair of security men are running toward you both.<br />
<br />
Thule holds his hand up warding back the men. He sighs again and begins to tell more.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Franks family is serving a very real purpose as you saw them at the zoo. As for the world's population of their breed is below one hundred alive they have the honor to do something for their world, while helping the breed survive. Its basic to keep the breeds going one must have high quality stock which remains healthy. The learned memory patterns while those so changed from when they were human trails along. Horses, as some find that eating manure theirs or anothers is a treat, other horses would never do that they know it might hurt them. <br />
<br />
Now think about little Hank as he inside six weeks will be sold to a breeding farm for Hogs. A mature boar will he be able to have sex with sows and by then damn willing too. Boar Hog that he be then he'll have the distinction of the only Hog there wanting to wipe his ass after every time he craps. Those learned habit carry on as almost inbred instincts do with the animals themselves.<br />
<br />
Hank will do well, his is to be a long life doing what is needed to supply the country with bacon and chops. His is a DNA pattern as are most that leave here, they retain the human span of life and live sixty, seventy, or longer in years. <br />
<br />
Why the girl you met this mornig will be transported from here to a special island in the South Pacific. There within just six months even on their own the Reformation Process will finish the bodies and once goats they become goats and florish the breed, simple! Then too per chance some fool visit the island we just end up with more goats for final sale. They will be the beginnig of a wonderous herd, worthy of one's life, yes, no?&quot; asked the Doc.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You so cold about it, that lady you made a stallion, she's lost in her fantasy of being a male horse but what of her family, her own work, what of all that?' you are ready to bust.<br />
<br />
&quot;She as most was a nobody! A lady of the night she sold her body for sex. Now she can live for sex and be on the other end of the shaft. Ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot; laughs the Doc.<br />
<br />
Your walking in circles the head aches and your but is getting sore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, maybe for her being a stallion at stud is better than the life of a street whore, but not everybody is worthless to society! The two Donkeys that passed by when Florence and I talked earlier, what of them?&quot; you ask as if they might prove a point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Donkeys, donkeys......oh yes those two, they were something really special, I liked them both! The two of them waltzed in here planning to steal whatever wasn't tied down. Thieves they were till I made them sound as a fiddle. Both were boys but I made one a female for the other's personal pleasure, neat huh!&quot; told the Doc yet more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of their parents, family, they might have made something of themselves in time!&quot; you explode the thought of so many made beasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh their parents was just a father and he was more than reasonable when I made the cash offer we keep them for scientific study. A cheap $500. each and now as a healthy pair I can get almost $4,000. perfect!&quot; chides the Doc to your arguement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now come, we need to go as there are many I wish to show you and time is runnig past. Would you be interested in being an Angora buck goat, shaggy and warm you'd live?&quot; asked the Doc.<br />
<br />
You shrug and climb aboard the cart.</p>
