<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As of all who did dare to set foot on the old mansion property, the barns tended to be the places most felt or found their time for finding delight, or enlightenment.<br />
<br />
Various people came on that property and so few ever left it in the same way they arrived.<br />
<br />
The decaying and vacant mansion had broken windows and ransacked into a sham of what it was so many years now gone into history. The two oddities which remain there for unwitting people to find and become entrapped, one stood in the mansion basement, as the other stood dangerous and waiting in the base level of the one biggest barn on that property.<br />
<br />
A blue light and wooing sounds of air passing through a portal made for traveling through the vast rivers of time, sat in the mansion basement.<br />
<br />
A few likely people found their way down into the blackness that was the unlighted basement. Those who came with flashlights, as if prepared to do or want to do something in a secluded place; instead found an enchanting item to probe at times past, places present, and of future events yet to become a part of reality.<br />
<br />
Six friends came to play on the mansion property, we thought it a neat place for us to play hide, and go seek.<br />
<br />
Seven came but only I ultimately made my way back down the long driveway and to where we came through the front gates of that damning property.<br />
<br />
Voices in the basement suggested of men talking and the sound of Norman, a fellow chum or ours, but he having disappeared some months ago.<br />
<br />
We all listened by the door leading down into the dank and humid, dark basement of the old mansion. Ryan, Johnny, Rebecca, Sei, and Mike turned, as some people would say, “A deaf ear,” to the conversation down below. Eric and I remained there listening, we looking one at the other and wondering about all until Norman did not speak, but some goat bleated as if feeling a sense of panic.<br />
<br />
Ryan, he the oldest, and Johnny the younger brother of Ryan, Mike the stout and stronger of the seven, he played all sports and looked the athletic type, as well with us was Sei, born in India, his family moved to town and the manner of how they spoke seemed to bring him into being as part of our group.<br />
<br />
Rebecca, a wow of a looker, she the epedemy of what every lad wished he could have as a girlfriend. She the Lord made so well created, she busting where it added to her enticements, otherwise a slender waistline and carried her poise to the drooling desire of every chum who had an eye to gaze upon real beauty.  <br />
<br />
Ryan, Mike ultimately became as young stud male donkeys, as for Sei too, and his meeting of a witch woman time traveler who came from the basement portal; he along with friend Rebecca, found their bodies changed to living as jennet donkeys.<br />
<br />
Neither Sei nor Rebecca thought at first their change of form as something desirable. Sei fought to try to remain male, but the powers of this lusty witch were far superior. Rebecca begged the woman, pleading with her, she was in the sexiest of forms already, but her pleading went unheeded.<br />
<br />
Naturalists together as donkeys, four friends tried first to graze but it was inevitable they would feel the panging desire to be like what Circe the witch did want of them to become. <br />
<br />
Soon enough and four good friends were friends together, giving into their natural instincts and living life as would real donkey animals. Mike the athlete started the wild mayhem, he finding Rebecca still quite his wild and lusty fantasy. Courting Rebecca in true donkey fashion turned Ryan to try his luck with friend Sei, one such embarrassed fellow then standing defrocked of his maleness, a jennet donkey and feeling the pangs of equine estrus.<br />
<br />
The youngest and smaller of our little group, Johnny, the brother to Ryan, did, by the keen eye of Circe to allow the lad time to mature before thrusting himself into wild and arousing frolic, she made of him a Shire draft horse colt. He seemed of like what he became, trotting off down the driveway, out the gates, and along up the road to where another farm stood, a working farm, and a place that had and used horseflesh to do physical work.<br />
<br />
Another of our group was laughing Eric, he a prankster, and with his meeting Circe, she bade him to continue his making merry, turning him to lust and seeking more lust. It was with sad but passionate eyes I watched as Eric changed, he becoming female, transforming into something part womanly and mostly of likeness to an alluring nanny goat.<br />
<br />
Just seeing what Circe made of Eric, his/her furry breasts, the thick pelt covering her with goat hairs, and I am reminded of how she had these long, black, and male alluring nipples, they stuck puckered out a good two inches from each of her breasts.<br />
<br />
Eric became the hot prodding thrill of anyone manly or male, be them human or animal, this female form begged for to be screwed.<br />
<br />
Myself then, I saw too much and knew of Circe the Greek witch having come into our times. <br />
<br />
I ran from the mansion, but from where on a high hill the builders built the mansion, the viewing of those coming or leaving offered a view unimpeded. <br />
<br />
As I let swing closed the iron gates and did run along the country road in the direction of home, I began to admire my stamina and the new ability to run and stride long.<br />
<br />
At least two miles of running along that gravel and clay road led me to come to the crossroad of Spelstorm Road and the state highway known as number five. Chuffing each breath as I exhaled, struggling to catch each breath, I began to listen hard, hearing more than just me, but of sounds, I had not heard or taken of any such a notice.<br />
<br />
The entire world seemed to open before me, although from tears and road dust my eyes seemed slightly out of focus, my hearing and sense of smell lent me to realize something of me was very different.<br />
<br />
Passing cars and looks from people in them were but the second denoted reason for me to ponder my easy escape from the mansion and that evil witch.</p>
