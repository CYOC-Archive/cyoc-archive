<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up to sunlight breaking through the windows. You roll over trying to get a bit more sleep but something feels off. Your just sprawled out on top of your bed, buck naked, you never sleep naked, well other than the hat you can feel settled on your head. Your eyes snap open as you remember what happened yesterday, meeting those guys in the park then going back to their frat.. how much did you drink? Your parents are going to be pissed.<br />
<br />
You look around the room, it&#39;s definitely not yours. Two beds, one on either side, books, clothing, and other things strewn around in a chaotic mess that definitely screams &#39;two young guys live here&#39;. Your phone! Probably in your shorts wherever you left them.. You get up. The guys you met didn&#39;t seem so bad, maybe they could help you get home. But something feels off, just from they way your moving. Your eyes are bleary from sleep and your head pounding from what you guess is a hangover, but you see a door open to what looks to be a bathroom so you stumble that way.<br />
<br />
Turning on the sink, you splash water in your face, then meet your gaze in the mirror. Shock rocks through you. Its your face, mostly, but looks a few years older, a little more square, and you definitely didn&#39;t have any stubble yesterday morning, or even the ability to really grow it, but your jaw was covered in what looked to be a couple days worth of the stuff. You lift your hand and rub your jaw, the scratchiness confirming it&#39;s real.<br />
<br />
Then you notice your arm, not scrawny but toned with lean muscle. Your attention drifts down your body, hand drifting over pectorals with a light dusting of hair, down your treasure trail, and to the monster between your legs. While the rest of it could be your body just older and with muscle, this was something you never had. It sprung to life almost immediately at your touch, and you snatch your hand back as if burned, but slowly you find your fingers wrapping around it again. It.. just felt so good. The shock of your situation wearing off, the thought of getting home and getting out of here pushed back from your mind for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish jerking off and lets go.&quot; Brian is standing in the doorway, dressed in a tank top, shorts, and sneakers, staring at you with an amused grin. Powerful arms crossed over his burly chest, chestnut brown hair visible across those pecs from the low neckline of the tank top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go?&quot; You find yourself miming dumbly. The clear thought you had upon waking up seeming to disappear back into a slight fog.<br />
<br />
&quot;To the gym. Same as every morning.&quot; He didn&#39;t sound concerned at your befuddled words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. need to find my phone.&quot; A thought you had upon waking up coming pouring to the front of your mind. Parents. Were you expecting a call from your parents?<br />
<br />
&quot;On the desk charging, where you always leave it.&quot; Brian stepped aside and you walked over to your desk. Sure enough your phone, wallet, and keys all sat in a neat little pile. Where you always leave it.<br />
<br />
Brian goes and sits on the other bed, his bed you remember, as he waits for you. Though his eyes do seem to linger on you quite a bit. &quot;Sending someone a dick pic?&quot; He jokes. Every time you hear Brian&#39;s voice your thoughts seem to jumble.<br />
<br />
You stare at your phone screen. Something tells you you should be seeing a bunch of frantic texts from your parents.. from someone.. but there&#39;s nothing. You open your contacts to call... who? Your thumb hovers over the screen. Who were you going to call? Must not have been that important, it can wait till after the gym.<br />
<br />
You walk over to your closet and get dressed pretty similarly to Brian, though your clothes seem extremely baggy on your frame, but they;re your clothes. You then grab your backpack to shove your phone, wallet, and keys into. Seeing you ready, Brian picks up his own backpack and you both head off to the campus gym, only stopping for a moment down in the kitchen to grab a protein bar and a bottle of water before heading out. It all feels.. disturbingly routine. Brian jokes with you as you walk, talking about classes, teachers, other students. At first you don&#39;t recognize the names but the more he talks the more you can put memories to the words. You find yourself laughing along as Brian rates several professors on sexiness. He&#39;s unashamedly bisexual, you know you&#39;re straight, but the more he talks though, the more you find yourself agreeing more with his ratings of male professors.<br />
<br />
Soon, you&#39;re shoving your bag in a locker and heading out onto the floor of the gym. The campus gym is pretty deserted with it being summer and all. There&#39;s only a few students left on campus, and you and Brian have a habit of getting here early to avoid too many people anyway, so as it is, it seems only the two of you are there. Warming up first with a little cardio, then taking turns spotting each other on the weight bench, you two have a routine you know without even having to think. A routine you two have had since you both joined the frat as freshmen and the stocky wrestler took the scrawny, younger you under his wing.<br />
<br />
Some part of your brain notices that with each rep you&#39;re packing on more muscle, much quicker than should even be possible, but that part of your mind still feels wrapped up in a foggy haze. Your arms that went from scrawny to leanly muscled yesterday are now as thick as your legs were. Your baggy tank top that drooped off just defined pectorals now hugged the twin mounds of muscle. Still leaner than Brian&#39;s naturally broad build, but far and away from the scrawny kid you once were. You could easily fit in with the college athletes and no one would question it. No one did when you hung out with them.<br />
<br />
A slap on your back pulled your attention away from the mirror. &quot;Done staring at yourself? You looked like you were about to start licking your reflection.&quot; Brian said teasingly as he veered towards the locker rooms with you in tow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just.. thinking about what I used to look like.&quot; You say. Part of you mind surging at the comment before sinking back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You put in good work these last two years, you should be proud.&quot; Brian says with a grin that makes you smile in return.<br />
<br />
Two years? It&#39;s barely been two days. The odd thought passes through your brain, though it disappears as you catch a whiff of your hairy pits as you reach out to open your locker. &quot;Fuck. I need to take a shower. I haven&#39;t since before the Frisbee game yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian chuckles. &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t notice, but I&#39;m used to my nose being stuck in sweaty pits. Hit the showers if you want.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t grab a towel or soap before leaving, I can wait till we get back.&quot; Though as you look at Brian, he reaches into his bag and pulls out a bottle of body wash and a towel, tossing it to you. &quot;Or not..&quot;<br />
<br />
You strip and head to the showers, tossing the towel on a bench where it won&#39;t get wet and turning on one of the heads. You let the warm water pour over you, cleaning off sweat and grime. You start to lather up, the body wash getting especially foamy where you work it into your body hair, the shower next to yours turns on as Brian steps under the water to clean himself up as well.<br />
<br />
As you&#39;re rinsing off, you suddenly feel a body pressed against your back, furry chest pressed against your back. You feel a hand wrapping around your cock which has become almost instantly hard. For a moment you want to pull away, but you wrap your hand over the one on your cock as the slow steady strokes begin.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a feeling of scratchy facial hair against your neck and shoulder as Brian&#39;s voice whispers into your ear. &quot;This is who you are supposed to be, this is where you&#39;re supposed to be.&quot; As those words sink into your mind you feel your thoughts clearing up. Worry and anxiety that has been building in the back of your mind is just melting away. You nod in agreement.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re going to be a junior in college next year, you&#39;ve been with the frat for two years now, Brian&#39;s been your roommate and best friend since you two met. Best friend, occasional fuck buddy, even when one or the other is dating someone you two love messing around. You two aren&#39;t unique in the frat either. All the brothers are pretty easy with such things. Sex is sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;You trust me, don&#39;t you?&quot; You nod again. You can feel his cock pressed up against your ass, thick, hard, and hot. Though Brian is more focused on jerking you off right now. But you can remember feeling that thick tool inside you more than once, just like you know what it feels like to bury yourself in Brian&#39;s furry ass. You feel your balls churn at the thought and with a grunt you come, splashing the tile wall with globs of cum, some spilling down over Brian&#39;s fingers. He brings his hand up to your mouth and you suck your seed off his digits.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re getting laid tonight, one way or the other.&quot; Brian says as he pulls away from you, grabbing his towel and heading back to the lockers, you follow. Feeling lighter and better than you have in a while.</p>
