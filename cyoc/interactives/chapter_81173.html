<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob was still emanating his musky smell as it filled the room with its odour. He starting going through his <br />
dad's clothes, trying to find something that fit, but his larger belly might put a cog in that plan. Chad <br />
still couldn't believe this smelly man was his brother. How could a boy turn into a man in minutes anyway? He <br />
noticed his pyjamas were starting to fill constricting. They were his brother's old hand-me-downs and were as <br />
loose as anything before he bumped into the man. Now he needs to take them off before he bursts out of them. <br />
Maybe that man was telling the truth after all! &quot;Oh my gosh, I'm growing! What's going on!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jacob stopped his search to look at Chad, who already looked twice his original age and ready to rip his <br />
pyjamas. Whatever made him older is affecting his brother as well. The smell that's coming out of his body has <br />
to be the cause, but how can he stop it. Another loud fart ripped from his body, letting out a transparent <br />
cloud of scent which headed straight for Chad while he was trying to take his pyjamas off. He didn't even have <br />
time to react as he aged another 10 years in an instant, now a man of 22. He had hair covering his larger body <br />
which was still aging. His large cock was now freely hanging down, slowly starting to get erect. Chad looked <br />
speechless, his mouth quivering behind his new beard. If he hadn't believed his brother by now, this certainly <br />
seemed strong evidence towards it. Jacob was scared, his body was capable of making people age by smell alone, <br />
and it was still affecting him. A look in the mirror inside the wardrobe showed he was now older than his dad <br />
by at least a decade, his head was clear of hair and his body hair was mainly grey. He'd really packed on the <br />
weight now. His vision was starting to get blurry, which didn't seem to help matters. Finally, Chad spoke up <br />
saying &quot;Is this because of that smelly food you ate earlier? Why did you eat it? It was smelly&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know that by eating it, I was going to get older, then get smelly, then make other people older from <br />
the smell! I mean it even sounds ridiculous to say out loud&quot;. They were both worrying. Chad seemed to be aging <br />
even faster than Jacob was, already nearing 30 years old. His muscular body was starting to soften under its <br />
layer of hair. Jacob was starting to enter his 60s, all of his hair a shade of white and his face was rounded <br />
with lots of lines across it. His legs were starting to ache. He gave up his search for clothes, realising he <br />
was much too hefty to fit into anything in the wardrobe now. Sighing, he collapsed onto the bed, and it <br />
groaned under his weight. Chad turned around, grey hairs starting to appear in his beard, and went over to his <br />
brother. Unluckily, Jacob let out another fart as Chad reached the bed. The scent literally made his hair fall <br />
out as he aged another 10 years in an instant, his beard going from brown to grey in seconds, and his muscles <br />
converting to fat with an audible gush. He gagged at the strong musky smell, trying to breath in clean air but <br />
only getting that taste in his mouth, aging even quicker than before. It wasn't long before Chad had joined <br />
his brother in being older than their dad. He stumbled about and fell onto the bed opposite Jacob, who was <br />
getting closer to 70 by the minute. His eyesight had deteriorated to just seeing vague shapes, and all of his <br />
teeth had fallen out. He'd lost all feeling in his legs, not able to get up off the bed now. He was going to <br />
die of old age smelling like a unclean gym. He couldn't believe his luck. He turned to his brother, or what he <br />
assumed was his brother, and croaked &quot;I'm so sorry I dragged you into this. Now we're going to die as old <br />
men&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chad smiled at his aging brother, and held his bony hand. &quot;It's not your fault, there has to be a way to fix <br />
this&quot; but he didn't sound hopeful. He himself was already close to 60 now, his face was rubbery and saggy, his <br />
body was soft and just as saggy, and most of his hair was white. Whatever was happening should hopefully stop <br />
soon as the smell seemed to be dispersing. He couldn't believe he was 10 times his actual age by now, and his <br />
brother was even older. Then the door opened and in came their father. He was slack jawed at the two naked old <br />
men laying on his bed, then fainted. Chad tried to get up and help him, but his back gave out as he sat up, <br />
making him lay back on the bed in pain. He turned to Jacob who looked even worse for wear, his skin was really <br />
loose and he'd experienced some extreme weight loss, leaving a large flap of skin on his smaller stomach. His <br />
breathing was haggard and he had his eyes closed. What were they going to do?</p>
