<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At school, Haylee for a while manages to hide her cock, but the tightness of her shorts that are not meant to hide such a monstrous cock were beginning to get uncomfortable. She definitely would need to go out and get some new clothes. Now that she thought about it, she likely would need to pick up a bra for Ephelia sometime soon, since now her body is no longer producing testosterone, at all, she almost certainly will start developing breasts naturally as estrogen floods her system. Haylee already was planning on taking a testosterone reducer to offset the influx she would be receiving too.<br />
<br />
Hayleenwanted to keep her feminine looks, just now with the only difference being having a massive cock instead of a pussy. The thought of hiding her &quot;big&quot; secret in public was turning her on too. This fetish is one of the few she got from Ethan. As she walked next to Ethan, she noticed something she hadn&#39;t before. &quot;Were you always shorter than me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I don&#39;t know? I thought we were pretty close in height.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I did too, but now you are definitely a bit shorter than me... weird.&quot; Said Haylee while shrugging. &quot;Maybe we forgot to swap some small part back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. But even if we did, I do not really mind you being a bit taller than me, if that is the case&quot; says Ethan rather casually. Ethan was enjoying this perhaps a bit too much. <br />
<br />
He was already aroused when he had his brother&#39;s tiny dick. And now that he had a full time pussy and will not have a dick ever again unless it is inside of him, he was always turned on in a dull state of arousal. Just being out in public turned him on now, as he was constantly wondering if anyone could tell, and what would happen if they did find out? The sense of impending humiliation. And the subtle desire to get discovered that was ever present was getting stronger and stronger for Ethan. <br />
<br />
Haylee looked over to her girlfriend, and noticed that her face was pretty red. And that she was breathing differently. She also had this, out of it, look to her. &quot;Hey, come with me for a minute&quot; Haylee said, pulling Ethan down a rarely used hallway and into the lady&#39;s bathroom. No one used this bathroom really as it was so far out of the way. So they could have some privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you feeling alright? Your face is pretty red and you are breathing funny&quot; Haylee asked with concern. Ethan was a bit too deep into his head and didn&#39;t hear her. &quot;Hey!&quot; Haylee shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh ,sorry. I must have spaced out there for a second...&quot; said Ethan apologetically. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up with you? You have been acting weird. Do you feel alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded &quot;yeah, I feel fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then what is it? Something has your face all red and your breathing messed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I am really horny right now. One of my core fetishes is humiliation, specifically, being humiliated. And the thought of someone discovering that I have a pussy, or if anyone can tell by looking at my pants... and especially when I go to swim practice later... I is just constantly turning me on. Every person I pass makes me feel like they all know, or that I am just seconds away from getting discovered&quot; Ethan admits, resting his forehead on Haylee&#39;s shoulder. <br />
<br />
Haylee didn&#39;t know what to do for once. Well, she knew one option, but that wouldn&#39;t really solve the issue. But doing something is better than doing nothing right? &quot;Well, wanna have a quicky? Maybe getting off will help you calm down a bi-ahh! Hold on a sec, you don&#39;t need to yank my arm off.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second Haylee offered sex, Ethan started pulling her into a stall, not even letting her finish her sentance. He unbuttoned, then unzipped her shorts and pulled them down, then did the same for himself. He pushed her down onto the toilet seat and was practically ready to jump on her cock. But Haylee stopped him. <br />
<br />
Haylee stood up and got behind Ethan. She forced Ethan to bend over and place his hands on the handle bar behind the toilet. She placed his left leg up onto the toilet seat after pulling it out of his shorts. &quot;There, now you are in the right position, Ephelia&quot; said Haylee as she clasped her strapless bra and quickly slipped it onto her girlfriend, giving her her boobs. <br />
<br />
Ephelia gasped as the sudden weight pulled down heavily on her chest. But she was only turned on by it even more. Her pussy was soaked by now and Haylee could visibly see that. Ephelia stuck out her ass and wiggled it in eagerness. <br />
<br />
Haylee didn&#39;t need hesitate and shoved her cock right in, penetrating all the way down to the base. Ephelia nearly screamed out in pleasure, but managed to fight it down to a muffled cry by gagging herself with her forearm. Haylee swapped out Ephelia&#39;s forearm with a wad of paper, so that she didn&#39;t create a mark or bite herself on accident. She also made a mental note to pick up a ball gag that was made to muffle sounds for Ephelia since she would need it if they ever were to have sex in public like this again.<br />
<br />
While she was screwing Ephelia, Haylee was also playing with Ephelia&#39;s borrowed boobs. Teasing her nipples, giving them slight tugs, and just feeling them up in general. &quot;Hey, once you grow your own boobs, we should get their nipples pierced with a pair of rings. Then get you a pretty collar to chain them to. That way I can lead you around on a leash.&quot; Said Haylee. She then leaned in close and whispered into Ephelia&#39;s ear. &quot;And walk you around, showing off how cute your new pierced boobies look, in... front... of... everyone.&quot; The second she said the word &quot;everyone&quot;, Haylee felt Ephelia clamp down tight on her cock as she came.</p>
