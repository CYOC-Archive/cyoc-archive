<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Watkins was having a terrible time trying to calm down Mrs. Davenport. She&#39;d called in a few hours ago reporting that her son had gone missing but even over the phone she didn&#39;t seem to be making too much sense. Her ability to form any kind of coherent thought seemed to have gone out the window once she realized her son had gone missing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I--I--I jusdonknowherehecouldhavegone!&quot; she wailed again into a tissue. It didn&#39;t matter that her son was 18 and a senior in his high school. She seemed to be under the impression that he&#39;d been kidnapped and was for sure going to have something happen to him. &quot;He&#39;s just such a soft sweet boy! Who could do something like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Davenport, please, I need you to calm down. We can&#39;t do anything if you don&#39;t give us any more information. Was there anything he said to you before...&quot; Officer Watkins realized he was about to say missing and it sent the woman into another fit of tears. Her hefty body leaned up against his, hugging him tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know! He&#39;s never out this late! I know something must have happened to him! I know it!&quot; she sobbed into Officer Watkins shirt.<br />
<br />
Officer Watkins turned to his partner. All Officer Fulton could do was shrug. He gave an uncomfortable smile, not knowing how to help. Looking around the room, he was able to find a box of tissues and handed one to Mrs. Davenport. &quot;Here. Maybe this will help.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took the tissue and blew hard into it. It quickly filled up with snot. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she apologized. &quot;It&#39;s just he&#39;s such a sweet little boy. I don&#39;t know what could have happened to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Officer Watkins pat her on the back a few times trying to sooth her. &quot;He&#39;s not even been missing for a few hours. Maybe he&#39;s just with a friend or his phone was turned off during a movie...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Davenport went into another heavy wail. &quot;He doesn&#39;t have any friends!&quot; she dug her head into Officer Watkins&#39; chest again. Her loud wails were uncontrollable as she held him even tighter. If not for his strong body, he could have easily been broken in two by the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;There... There...&quot; Officer Watkins didn&#39;t know what else to say. Never had he had such a blatant, almost mean answer, to the offer of he was with friends. He slowly tried to pry her off of his body. &quot;How about we look around a little bit to see if we can find anything. You take something to help you sleep. And I&#39;m sure by tomorrow morning Andrew will be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; the little bit of hope in the woman&#39;s eyes helped Officer Watkins&#39; pull her off his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know so,&quot; he gave her the most genuine smile he could muster. Even if it was a lie, she obviously needed something to help her get through the night. And telling her the truth that they had no leads or anything to go on was completely pointless. Besides this would give them time to stall from having to go check on the UFO that old man McFedricks said that he&#39;d seen. It wasn&#39;t the first time they&#39;d been out to check on his old farm, and it wasn&#39;t going to be the last. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you&#39;re so right,&quot; she finally admitted. &quot;Here I am all bothered and I bet the boy is just at the movies or something. I&#39;m sorry. you probably think I&#39;m a complete and total mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No...&quot; Officer Watkins lied again as he saw all her makeup running down her face. &quot;It&#39;s completely normal to be worried about your son. But I do think we should take a quick look around just to make sure that there&#39;s nothing wrong. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Mrs. Davenport clapped her hands together and gave a calm controlled smile. The confidence Officer Watkins was able to portray was enough to get her comfortable with the idea that her son was going to be alright. &quot;Again, I&#39;m so sorry for the inconvenience officers. I know you have a lot going on and I hate holding you up like this. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right, he&#39;ll be back in the morning and I&#39;ll look like a darn fool for all this mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Officer Watkins pat her on the shoulder as he stood up. &quot;It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re just worried about your son is all. And this is our job.&quot; Though honestly in their small town, there was barely anything that ever went on that could be deemed &#39;exciting&#39;. One of the high school students going missing would be talked about for years if it was actually true. But seeing just how controlling his mother was, Officer Watkins thought he probably just wanted a night out. <br />
<br />
Officer Watkins signaled Officer Fulton to follow him into the boys room. For an 18 year old it was incredibly clean. There were science posters lining the walls, his bed was made, no clothes on the floor, but his window was cracked ever so slightly. &quot;Look at this,&quot; he pointed to the window that had a bit of Tony Davenports clothes attached to it. &quot;He&#39;s just having a night out without his mother knowing,&quot; the officer laughed knowing that he was right. He turned back to Officer Fulton to see him playing on the kid&#39;s computer. &quot;What&#39;d you find?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno,&quot; the other officer smiled. &quot;Whatever it is sounds pretty funny. It&#39;s a character creator. Looks like that D&D shit. But instead of orcs, halflings or rogues looks like you choose elements and animals.&quot; He paused for a second with a broad grin on his face. &quot;Wanna make one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You want me to mess around with some kid&#39;s computer?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna go talk to Mr. McFredricks about his UFO problem again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without much deliberation Officer Watkins found himself agreeing with Officer Fulton. &quot;Fine whatever. But we delete it when we&#39;re done. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; Officer Fulton smiled. He instantly typed in Daniel Watkins to creation screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;You joking? Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause it makes it more fun. Now choose you&#39;re animal. And I guess element.&quot;</p>
