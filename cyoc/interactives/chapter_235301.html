<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Alice pushed the start button, Jake became aware of the now familiar feeling of his feet beginning to transform. &quot;What have you done?&quot; he asked his wife after looking at his feet &quot;You&#39;re not changing me into a ball. This isn&#39;t what I asked for&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right&quot; Alice replied &quot;I&#39;m changing you into the fantastic fuck machine. I want to experience for myself, what convinced you to emasculate yourself. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you as a machine for long, just long enough to test you out and consider improvements. Once you are a woman, I intend to change myself into an improved version of the machine you are becoming. I intend to give you the best fucking ever&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake by now was just a head on a mechanical body. His last words were &quot;I guess I can accept that. But why not tell me of your intention before you started?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice watched as the human head that had spoken those words changed into a silicon penis, equipped with a tongue, which sat on a metallic base. Jake was now a fuck machine. &quot;How do you feel Jake? Are you ready to fuck me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She got no reply. Puzzled she looked at the computer screen and realised her mistake. In her eagerness to transform Jake she had forgotten to switch his communication on. Jake would not be able to communicate with her. She also noticed that his awareness was also off. She figured that meant Jake&#39;s personality was gone. He was now just a mechanical dildo and there seemed to be no immediate way to alter that fact. Never mind. Lesson learned. He was only going to be a fuck machine long enough for Alice to test him out. When it was Alice&#39;s turn to become the new improved fantastic fuck-machine she would make sure her awareness and communication were on.<br />
<br />
Alice picked up the fuck machine and examined it. The silicon dildo was soft and smooth and hardened as Alice stroked it. It grew to about 9 inches. The tongue looked like a small human tongue situated near the base of the dildo. This would be interesting.<br />
<br />
The machine was quite heavy, too heavy to be used like a vibrator. They had designed it so that the machine sat on the floor and would be sat on by the mobile pussy. That was the part Alice now needed to play. Her pussy was dripping wet at the prospect so that shouldn&#39;t prove too difficult.<br />
<br />
Alice had put her clothes back on after her last re-transformation. The panties came off once more but she left her skirt and top on. She positioned the fuck machine back on top of the sheet where Jake had last lain. She then squatted above the machine guiding the tip of the silicone dildo towards the lips of her vagina, covering the machine with her skirt. This actually proved to be a difficult manoeuvre. Even before making contact with the machine she knew it was not a pose she would be able to maintain. She was no gymnast. She stood up and addressed the machine. &quot;That won&#39;t work. I&#39;ll try kneeling over you&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice was more successful this time. She knelt over the machine and felt the dildo pushing into her soaked orifice. It was bigger than Jake&#39;s penis, indeed bigger than any penis that had ever penetrated Alice. It was a very tight fit, Alice was very lubricated, but the penetration was still painful. She actually became scared that her vagina would be torn. The fuck machine was too big. She paused her lowering when the dildo was halfway into her. Unfortunately this was not low enough to interact with the dildo&#39;s tongue. She could feel the tongue licking her inner thigh but it was not long enough to find her clit.<br />
<br />
Alice was stuck. She didn&#39;t want the dildo to penetrate her any further She wished she had thought of putting a button on the machine so that she could grow the size of the dildo but stop when it filled her. That could be an improvement that should be easy enough to make on the new improved version. What other changes could she make?<br />
<br />
It was awkward being on her knees and the angle at which the dildo was penetrating her wasn&#39;t helping either. The dildo was just too upright. perhaps a 45 degree angle would have been better? Probably flexibility of the angle was more important. <br />
<br />
And the dildo needed warmth. It was just cold silicone. It needed to be body temperature. She lowered herself a fraction more and felt the dildo pushing against her insides, was it going to bruise her cervix? See also realised it would be better if the dildo was mounted on a comfortable chair so that she wasn&#39;t kneeling or squatting on the floor. She withdrew slightly to ease the pain and felt the dildo pulsing  then squirt its fluid into her. It seemed what remained of Jake had shot its load, disgusted and unsatisfied, she raised herself and let the now soft dildo fountain its remaining fluid. The fantastic fuck machine had not been so fantastic after all.<br />
<br />
Alice moved over to the desk and jotted down her thoughts on improvements to the fuck machine. Re-transforming Jake could wait. It was most important that when Alice was next a fuck-machine that it was properly designed. She really did want the woman that Jake was about to become, have the ultimate experience.<br />
<br />
Alice spent the next 30 minutes redesigning the fuck machine. A breakthrough was when she decided to have the dildo mounted on something like a soft rocking horse that she could wrap her legs around as she was penetrated. The neck of the horse could also serve as handle bars to keep her steady or something to hug as she climaxed. Effectively the horses saddle would be replaced by the fake penis which would hold the woman in place. With great enthusiasm she used the computer to mock up her design. About the only feature that remained from the original design was the tongue. She glanced at the machine sitting on the floor. Perhaps Jake could also suggest improvements? It was probably time to re-transform him.<br />
<br />
Of course she needed to alter his log before the re-transformation. What were those numbers again?</p>
