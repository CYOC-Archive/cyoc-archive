<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking it would store the animated photo of himself turning into a donkey on his hard drive for the specified amount of time, he chose the permanent option.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long for his ears to begin growing. He immediately felt the tugging on his ears. Reaching up to scratch it, he felt them growing beneath his fingertips, and getting hairy. This froze him for a second, out of fear.<br />
<br />
The only thing he could think was: &quot;What the fuck? Is this for real?&quot;<br />
<br />
As his ears finished growing, he then felt pressure at the base of his spin, just above his asshole. It was getting more and more uncomfortable, so he pulled down his shorts, and saw a tail growing out of him. It was growing longer and longer, and getting more and more ropey looking. Finally, a tassel at the end popped out.<br />
<br />
He stood up, and held this new appendage that appeared out his rear, and tried tugging on it. It caused a bit of pain.<br />
<br />
As his fear began rising, he quickly ran to the bathroom to look in the mirror in order to confirm that those ears were real. On the way there, he felt pressure on his feet, and tripped and fell to the ground in the hall way. Sitting up, he saw his socks rip apart, as his feet grew. his toes were merging. First there were five toes on each foot. Then three; than two. Then both toes on each foot were finally swallowed up as his feet were consumed by a couple of hooves.<br />
<br />
He quickly tried to regain his feet (hooves!!) in order to get in front of the mirror, still not quite believing this was all real. As he was struggling to get up, gray fur began growing up both his legs, when he finally managed to stand.<br />
<br />
Stumbling the rest of the way toward the bathroom, his legs began to reshape themselves, as bones and tendons were twisting and muscle was growing. When this started happening, he fell forward, with his hands on the sink. It wasn't really painful, it just felt....strange, like someone trying to mold clay or something.<br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror, he saw two giant ridiculous-looking donkey ears standing straight up, with gray fur adorning his handsome face. He tried grabbing them, to take them off. But it hurt every time he tried pulling up on them. They were standing up, real tall and wide, growing out of the sides of his head. How embarrassing! <br />
<br />
Finally deciding it was, indeed, real, he ran/stumbled back to his room in order to find a way to stop the machine. As he arrived, he started feeling the same thing in his face. He first felt stubble growing out, then his teeth began to feel strange.<br />
<br />
As this was happening, he heard the door opening downstairs!<br />
<br />
His heart literally jumped up into his throat! He couldn't let his twin brother see him this way! No way! This is beyond embarrassing! He would probably laugh at first, then ask me to take those ridiculous ears off, and how could I explain to him they wouldn't come off!?<br />
<br />
You see, Jeff shared the same room with his identical twin brother, Mike. Knowing the first place he comes to is their shared bedroom, he couldn't let Mike see him this way!<br />
<br />
So he grabbed up the machine, and tried to run back to the bathroom, forgetting about the hooves on the end of his legs instead of feet. Once again, he fell forward, nearly landing on the Chronivac. Fortunately, he missed landing on the thing. Unfortunately, this fall made a loud noise, and Mike downstairs heard it.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly grabbed up the machine again, and crawled to the bathroom on his hands and knees, shut the door, and locked it!<br />
<br />
Attempting once again to stand up, he grabbed the machine, and placed it on the counter top next to the sink. Looking up at the mirror once again, he saw the progression his face has made while he was in the room fooling around. His nose was widening and flaring out, and the teeth in his mouth were growing larger and getting yellower. His jaw began to jut out further, in order to accommodate his larger teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? You alright? What was that noise?&quot; called Mike.<br />
<br />
Jeff responded, by saying: &quot;I'm fine Mike. I just slipped in the bathroom is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you're OK? Your voice sounds different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine. I think I'm coming down with a cold,&quot; he coughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, OK. Just don't get me sick, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I won't!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm heading out for a while to Marissa's. I'll catch you later!&quot; said Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'll see ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew! That was close!&quot; thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
All the sudden, his tongue puffed up, and came flopping out of his mouth. His breath was also changing, and he felt his asshole expand larger.<br />
<br />
As his rump began taking on a more equine shape, his spinal column began changing into one more suitable for a quadruped. At the same time, it was growing longer, and he was putting on more weight. Now, the gray donkey hide was coming out everywhere below his neck.<br />
<br />
Realizing it was getting a bit more difficult standing upright in front of the mirror, he had to grab onto the sink, eventually resting on his elbows, as his back end continued expanding outward, further away from his head, and closer to the wall behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! My time is running out! And I haven't even tried anything yet! I need to look at the chronivac!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally looking down at the screen, he tried canceling the program. A message popped up, and said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, you cannot cancel the sequence at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit! I wonder if this thing comes with a Read Me file,&quot; thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
So he minimized the program, and opened the folder that contains the program .exe launcher. He found that it does contain a read me file! Yes!<br />
<br />
Clicking on it, and quickly scanning the index, he found the spot where it says about canceling the sequence of a transformation.<br />
<br />
Scrolling down, he began reading:<br />
<br />
&quot;Warning! Once a sequence of transformation has been chosen, it cannot be canceled. And in order to return to your original body, you must wait until the full time period of your transformation you have selected, has elapsed. Removing the power from the machine in any way, could disrupt the process and cause the files to become corrupt. Whatever form you were taking on will instantly finish and will become permanent!<br />
<br />
Reading over it again, it started to become blurry. He got to the part once again that read &quot;And in order to return to your original body, you must wait until the full time period of your transformation you have selected, has elapsed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, damn! I chose the &quot;Permanent&quot; option! What now!&quot;<br />
<br />
He started scanning the rest of the document for further instructions. At that moment, his spine straightened out completely into a quadruped spine, and he lost his grip on the sink. He fell forward, trying to use his hands on the floor to catch his balance.<br />
<br />
Since his arms and hands were still intact with the rest of his lower body mostly of equine size and shape, he ended up falling over on his right side. Struggling to get up, he ended up on his rump, with his legs (complete with hooves!!) sticking out from underneath him. Looking over his lower body, and upper torso, he sees he truly is turning into a REAL jackass donkey!!<br />
<br />
Then he felt his penis flaring up, and looked down in time to catch his sheath growing, becoming uncircumcised. The penis itself was turning black, growing....and growing....and growing. Until finally it looked like it TRULY belonged to a donkey!<br />
<br />
Reaching down, not quite believing this newest change was real, he touched his penis and it jumped. He reached up and sniffed his hand. It came away smelling like a dirty barnyard animal! This scared the bejesus out of Jeff, as he was looking down at this huge, ugly, dirty, smelly, black monster that was growing out of him!<br />
<br />
As he was sitting there in shock, looking at this monstrosity, his arms began stretching out before him turning into front legs with gray fur completely covering them. His fingers went through the same process as his toes had earlier. For a moment, he had five fingers on the ends of his donkey legs. Then three, then two. The two digits he had left, were quickly hardening even further, shrinking, and merging, until he was left with nothing but hooves, in place of his fingers; and fully-formed donkey legs, in place of his arms!<br />
<br />
He thought, &quot;Oh God! Not my hands! Please! Not my beautiful hands and fingers! I have nothing but clumsy donkey hooves now!&quot; looking at his newly-formed clumsy hooves in place of what used to be dexterous  human fingers, on the ends of his front legs, instead of human arms.<br />
<br />
Sitting there for a minute, his mind all-abuzz, he finally decided to try to stand up. Quickly forgetting that his spine is now only built for a donkey, and that he now has four legs instead of two, he crashed down on all fours. He was finally right-side up, and he could see into the mirror with his hands (no, his front legs!) planted solidly on the floor, rather than the sink.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, he saw just how ridiculous he looked. His face was still mostly human, with over sized teeth, a flared nose, and his mouth jutting out a bit. His eyesight was still largely intact, but he was more near-sighted than he ever was in his life.<br />
<br />
Looking down at the chronivac, it was now counting down to complete transformation. He had two minutes left, before he was a full jackass forever! He had to figure something out.<br />
<br />
So, attempting to reach forward with his right arm (forgetting it was now a leg, with a big lump of a donkey hoof on the end, instead of a beautiful, complex human hand,) he once again, began to lose his balance to the right, but quickly caught himself with his leg again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn! How the hell am I supposed to type and use a computer with these....hooves!?&quot;<br />
<br />
He decided to take a bit of a jump up with his front half, and rest his hooves on the counter top. So he did it, and quite successfully too!<br />
<br />
The only problem is, his neck began to stretch out now, preventing him from looking down at the screen in this position with the new-found height of his longer arms (now legs!!) resting on the counter top.<br />
<br />
So he went back down on all fours again, and tried once again raising his arm up. Once again, forgetting it was a leg with a hoof, instead of an arm with a hand!<br />
<br />
He went to say the word &quot;FUCK!&quot; But all that came out was a loud, animalistic &quot;HAWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now he began to feel some real dread at that sound. Using his longer, more flexible neck, he looked back behind him, across his body. All he saw was the hide of some donkey back there, making him feel completely disconnected from what he was becoming. What he has become.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the mirror, his hair has changed, and was growing down along his back, in the form of long, black main, on top of a gray furry body. Then a cross of black hair grew across his shoulder blades, marking him for what he has truly turned himself into.<br />
<br />
Feeling shame and frustration, all he could do was stand there and bray out a few attempts at speaking English.<br />
<br />
Finally, his face began pushing out into a Muzzle, as his amazing blue intelligent human eyes turned into dull-looking, large, dark donkey eyes. As this was happening, his persepctive was changing, making it harder and harder to look straight ahead. Noticing a large blind spot directly in front of him, he had to shift his body around in order to more clearly see the screen. Easier said than done, when you are unused to using the body of a clumsy donkey! Especially in a bathroom that is decidedly only meant for a human standing straight up and down, and not a donkey with his back-end straight out close to six feet behind his head! This caused a great deal of frustration, as he first began realizing just how hard it is being stuck in such a body as this!<br />
<br />
Trying to keep his panic under control and in check, he once again, looked back at the computer.<br />
<br />
For the third time, he forgot he no longer had hands, and tried bringing them up again in order to try something out with the computer. But once again, a harsh reality check was in store for him: His hands were nothing but a couple of lumps  that were nothing but clumsy hooves on the ends of his forelegs. <br />
<br />
Trying to use his tongue...ANYTHING...to manipulate the computer, his frustration began mounting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I'm a fucking DONKEY!? Jesus!&quot; All that came out was just a totally ridiculous, and unintelligible &quot;HEE-HAWW, HEE-HAWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to calm himself down once again, he saw the timer still ticking down, with 30 seconds left. (Just think. 10 minutes ago, he was in his room, a fully-formed, good-looking human being just sitting down at this evil device!)<br />
<br />
As the seconds were ticking by, he was wondering what more could possibly happen in order to make him even MORE fully into a donkey?<br />
<br />
That is when felt his mouth go sour, and his tongue and teeth both increase to obnoxious, ridiculous-looking sizes. He can now actually touch his new, slimy nose with his over-sized tongue. He could also smell his new donkey breath. He began retching, recalling that a few weeks before, he was grossed out by looking at a donkey's mouth at a nearby farm and felt the disgusting slimy tongue reach out and lick his arm. He now knows that same tongue now resides inside of his MOUTH, with big, ugly-looking yellow teeth!<br />
<br />
As he was retching, and trying to gag. Calming himself down, he now had a full side-ways perpective that only equine animals possess. This quickly put the idea of his gross donkey mouth and nose of his mind. For the moment, at least. He can now see his entire face of a strange donkey looking back, in the mirror. At the same time, he was becoming even MORE near-sighted, and lost all persective of colors, as the bathroom around him turned into a dull-looking monochrome color.<br />
<br />
He tried looking at the screen again, but couldn't see anything on the screen, and even if he could, he would never be able to read what was on it. His frustration rising again, with the realization of more disadvantages of possessing the body of a donkey feeling more and more trapped inside such a useless, dirty anmal. He wanted out, and wanted out NOW! But thought about the permanent change and how he will be forever trapped inside of this body, he REALLY began to panic. He bashed the chornivac with his head with five seconds to spare, and began stomping on it, thinking to himself:<br />
<br />
&quot;God, I want out! I want my body back! I don't have hands and arms anymore, and I cannot even speak!&quot;<br />
<br />
All that was coming out was an unintelligible &quot;Hee-Haww!! Hee-Haww!!&quot; braying.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, jut....one...word!&quot; Hee-Haaww, Hee-Haww&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say the word &quot;THE!&quot; Hee-Haww<br />
<br />
&quot;The! &quot; Hawww<br />
<br />
&quot;The....the....the...&quot; Hawww....hawww....hawww...<br />
<br />
After several minutes, and as his panicking began dying down, he looked around, and saw the damage to the bathroom he has done!<br />
<br />
He started trying to talk again, thinking of saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, oh! Now I am going to be in deep shit with mom and dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
But all that came out, once again, was a &quot;Heee-Haw...&quot; stopping halfway through the &quot;haww,&quot; representing the &quot;oh,&quot; in &quot;uh-oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back in the mirror, all he saw was this strange, and ridiculous-looking donkey looking back at him. He thought:&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't be in as much trouble with them, as I am looking like this now,&quot; and started to try to say it aloud, but quickly shut himself up, knowing words were useless at this point.<br />
<br />
He tried sighing, but all that came out was a long, and drawn-out, &quot;Hawww....&quot;<br />
<br />
And thought:<br />
<br />
&quot;What now!? A donkey, huh? A stupid donkey! A stupid, good-for-nothing donkey!&quot; He tried crying, but donkeys can't really cry. So he just tried moaning, and all that would come out, once again, was a constant &quot;haww, haww, haww.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking around, feeling more trapped than ever, not used to moving around in such a body, he remembered there were a few seconds left on the timer. He wondered what those few seconds were going to do to him. <br />
<br />
Thinking back to the instructions about if the computer loses any power, you would stuck in the form you have taken on forever. Maybe the last few seconds would have been the loss of his intellect, and the gaining of instincts? <br />
<br />
That's it! The last few seconds were probably a merciful loss of hman intellect, with the gaining of the insticts to use this body efficiently!<br />
<br />
So, here I am, with my complete human brain working, trapped inside the skull of a donkey, with the body of a fully-formed donkey, and no idea on how to control this beast!<br />
<br />
At that moment, he began sniffling and felt a sneeze come on. He wanted to scratch his nose, but not without his hands being free he couldn't! The best he could hope for, was to lick his nose! So he automatically brought out his big, ridiciulous-looking, sour donkey tongue out, and licked it. It felt slimy, and he sneezed on his tongue! He saw this in the mirror, and though:<br />
<br />
&quot;How gross it would be to be such an animal with a nasty-looking tongue like that,&quot; and brayed.<br />
<br />
Which further made him realize that was him! He just used his gross donkey tongue to lick his gross donkey nose! He thought about how disgusting it would be to lick a donkey's nose, and that is exactly what he just did!<br />
<br />
Once again, that grossed him out, and he began coughing and retching again. And braying. Sending him into another series of panic-stricken braying as he couldn't get out a single word in intelligent English.<br />
<br />
When that subsided, he looked around once more, and was really finally beginning to get a sense of what the rest of his life might be like. Standing around. his ears itching, and not being able to scratch them. Looking, feeling, smelling, and BEING a big, dirty nasty donkey!<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, his ears itched. His butt was itching. His eye was itching. He couldn't see colors, and he had no hands! He couldn't even so much as say the word &quot;the,&quot; and he was stuck with his fully-formed human brain!<br />
<br />
&quot;A god-damned donkey! And permanently with nothing to do! I can't read, write, play video games ever again. I can't even TALK!<br />
<br />
I couldn't have hit the 24 hour button! No! I had to hit the Permanent button! Jeez! In 23 hours from now, I would be back to being a normal human being! But instead of turning back into human again, I will stuck and imprisoned in this form forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hee-haww,hee-haww, hee-haww.</p>
