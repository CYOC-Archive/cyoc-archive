<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jezebell expected rescue. In her mind, she deserved better then this. They all deserved better.<br />
<br />
Rescue never came.<br />
<br />
Jezebell felt the two men grab her. She watched as two others grabbed Ally. Ally bucked and brayed but it was futile. The men had done this hundreds or thousands of times before. It was all in a days work.<br />
<br />
Ally's body may have been perverted but her determination was not. She managed to kick one of the men. He fell onto his back. Whether armoured or strong enough to sustain such an attack, the man only needed seconds to recover.<br />
<br />
Horror filled Jezebell as the man pulled a small prod out of his jacket, put it up to Ally and discharged it.<br />
<br />
Ally's screams as she fell to the ground would haunt Jezebell for the rest of her days.<br />
<br />
Jezebell tried to demand answers. They were doing this for a reason and Jezebell wanted to know what those reasons were.<br />
<br />
Failing that, Jezebell wanted to cuss the men out. She needed to say something!<br />
<br />
She couldn't.<br />
<br />
Brays were the limit of her repertoire. It was degrading and humiliating.<br />
<br />
Jezebell looked at Ally's fallen form, fearing her dead.<br />
<br />
Braying at the men seemed futile. They either didn't hear Jezebell, or didn't consider her worth responding to. Jezebell realized that there was no point in their responding. These men or at least the people that ran this place saw the human Jezebell, Ally, the former boy that Jezebell saw tearing the shop up and the former boy that tried to mate with Ally as stock or raw material; potential donkeys just waiting for the island's magic to process and deliver them into damnation.<br />
<br />
Jezebell realized that it was much the same way a vampire would see people as walking blood banks and not as people that felt pain, had families and lives; not to mention hopes, plans and dreams.<br />
<br />
It seemed an monstrous way of thinking, but to them, whether by free will or by brainwashing, it was reality.<br />
<br />
Jezebell felt a kick to her rear end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get moving,&quot; one of the men said.<br />
<br />
Jezebell looked back to see three of the men picking Ally up and to Jezebell's horror, throwing Ally over the cliff!<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't feel bad,&quot; the man said. &quot;At first you'll envy your friend but eventually, you'll be too stupid and ignorant to understand much of anything beyond you'll own desires and instinct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebell brayed and began to buck. This couldn't be happening! She wasn't stock! Things like this only happened to the other guy! She wasn't a donkey, she was a human! There had to be justice! She couldn't just become another statistic!<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we tell her sir?&quot; one of the men to throw Ally over the cliff asked.<br />
<br />
The man standing by Jezebell nodded. &quot;Why not, ease her mind somewhat. She won't be capable of understanding it soon enough but let her have some joy for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He petted Jezebell's nape, calming Jezebell somewhat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't fret young lady. You see, the process that did this to you and your friend is still somewhat active,&quot; the man said. &quot;Your friend likely won't drown. There's a good chance she'll become a seal, dolphin or otter. People like those species, do they not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebell brayed. Yes, most did tend to like at least one of them. But why would they throw Ally into a fate that they considered pleasant? It didn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you wonder too much, we have ships down there. There are always some who escape or attempt to end it rather then face a life as a donkey. By now, your friend is already changing. They'll recover her and she'll make an excellent addition to a zoo or circus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Life as a dolphin seemed preferable to one as a donkey. Jezebell considered jumping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you're expecting to jump right about now,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
Jezebell grunted. Her limited communication ability was already getting annoying. And what was that smell? It was like a zoo or barnyard. It couldn't be her, could it? No,  she was a decent person, not a smelly animal!<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even think about it. We let one get away, but I'm afraid that you have something much different in store for you,&quot; the man said. &quot;Besides, you'll be settling in any second now. My advice, don't fight it. Allow these instincts and training to guide you. You'll only be hurting yourself if you don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebell felt another wave of dizziness. She almost fell over but all four men responded with what must been perfect training and steadied her. The dizziness lasted for several moments. Jezebell's mind swam as though she'd been drinking all day or taken medication that causes extreme dizziness. When it faded, to an extent, Jezebell was no longer the young woman she'd been moments earlier.<br />
<br />
She couldn't pinpoint how she'd changed but she knew something was different. For one, she saw the men no longer as monsters out to harvest her but as people that she could trust and should listen to.<br />
<br />
A slap on the rump and Jezebell found herself walking with the men as though on autopilot. Someone or something had implanted thoughts and conditioning that would normally take months if not years of training. This was a normal response for her now. She could resist it with extreme willpower at this point but it would be like resiting the urge to do anything one has been doing for years.<br />
<br />
For Jezebell, it seemed this was the begging of the end of her life as a human. Or was it? <br />
<br />
Could she resist the training they'd grafted into her? And what of Ally? Was she doomed to drown in the rough waters and to die as a donkey? Were the men truthful and as Jezebell walked away, Ally was in the process of becoming an aquatic creature? Only you can answer those questions.</p>
