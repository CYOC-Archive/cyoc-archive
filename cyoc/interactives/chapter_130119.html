<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You saw that under the bed was your shy friend Karen, and just by knowing and seeing her you could tell she must be petrified. A few moments passed and Anubis looked like he was growing impatient, and you started getting worried yourself about what he might do. So you tapped Anubis on the shoulder and whispered,&quot;Exuse me my love? C...can she....have an exception?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anubis paused and turned back towards you and he raised one of his brows and asked,&quot;Why so my bride? Did I not give her a warning?&quot; You glanced down under the bed and saw Karen glance up at you, and you couldn’t help but blush and at the same time feel comforted that she didn’t try to run. You looked back to Anubis then you lowered your ears and let out a small whine then you explained,&quot;It’s just that....I know her, and....she’s a shy friend of mine, an artistic one, but still extremely shy. Your presence might have caused her to be frozen in fear my love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anubis paused then he nodded and looked at your nude body from top to bottom then he said,&quot;Shy then, well that’s one explanation for her inability to respond. But you say artistic too?&quot; Anubis paused turning around to the bed and to see Karen cowering beneath of it then he looked back at you and said,&quot;In that case I shall grant her some mercy for your sake my love. We should have an artisan fix you some proper clothing that effectively shows off how elegant that body of yours truly is, while also giving you the look of a goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen, who surely heard all of this by now looks up at you with Anubis confused now and she doesn’t seem to recognize you. She began to slowly make her way out from under the Egyptian style bed and she asked,&quot;Uh...um...who...are you?&quot; Anubis turned around and glanced down at Karen now and she froze in place as the gaze of his yellow eyes met hers. &quot;I am Anubis, the god of death, and this is my wife, your lovely goddess. I believe you two have met before, but your feeble human senses are incapable of recognizing her. For now, you serve under us, and to my lovely wife as her personal servant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s eyes darted to you and she was unsure of what to think of this, and you saw her nod and you sighed in relief that she did and when she replied,&quot;S....Sure, wh...what should I do first?&quot; Anubis grinned at her now then extended his arm and set his hand on her forehead. &quot;Just to help you fathom your new position I shall grant you with the knowledge about who my wife used to be, and also enough skill so that you can serve her exceptionally like your ruler. You should feel honored by this too, not all shall receive such a promotion, especially from me.&quot; Anubis exclaimed then his palm began glowing and a mark shaped like a jackal appeared on Karen&#39;s forehead.<br />
<br />
Karen’s clothes suddenly vanished and she started growing fur that was short like yours, and her hair turned black too. You watched as she experienced a similar transformation as you did, except her body structure remained roughly the same as it was. Anubis looked to her then looked back at you and sighed then turned back to her again. &quot;Perhaps a mere child shall not serve my immortal wife. You need to at least look like that you have the level of skill that you will partaken. Just like how my wife now looks her part as your queen.&quot; Anubis said then snapped his fingers, and you paused then looked down at your body. You didn’t realize this before but you resembled a woman in her prime, or rather an anthro jackal in her prime.<br />
<br />
Karen, while examining her body saw herself growing a bit taller, her breasts expanded out to C cups, and her overall body changed to look more mature. Karen now looked at you as she now also was a woman in her prime, but clearly not as sexy as you. Karen blushed as she looked at you with her yellow eyes, and suddenly her mark lit up white for a moment and her gaze was suddenly transfixed on you now. Karen was now shocked to the point where she covered her mouth, and then Anubis circled around her to examine his work and he nodded to her and said,&quot;Good, you are now fit to serve me, and I trust that you know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen nodded and bowed respectively to Anubis before she looked up at you and asked,&quot;I....is that really....you?&quot; You blushed and nodded to her and remained silent. Anubis grinned at the two of you before he started walking towards the exit to the room. He then snapped his fingers and to your right a table, that used to be broken had fixed itself, and slowly the entire room changed as if it had been returned to its former glory. The bed now with a golden frame, and now fit for two, the torches around the room lit up to reveal what an exquisite room this was. The walls to both sides of the bed had two paintings, to the left of the bed was a painting of Anubis, and to the right was you. <br />
<br />
The bed itself, with its golden frame, had veils drooping down from all sides of it with the head of the bed against the wall. There was a quilt hanging on the wall to the right of the bed and it depicted two jackals hugging each other close. There was a male and a female that were dressed like king and queen, and the female was obviously pregnant by almost six months. Scanning down you blushed as you saw the male&#39;s red canine dick penetrating the female’s vagina while they hugged, and while this was a bit disturbing it felt heartwarming to you for some odd reason. <br />
<br />
Then on the table there was a golden platter with a bowl and two small urns that looked like water jugs. In fact the jugs were already filled with water, and the blowl was filled with fruits that all looked like they were ripe and fresh. The fruits were an alpple, some grapes, and a banana, and they sat on the table that looked to be expertly carved from white marble stone. Finally two plants appeared in the corners of the room behind you, and each seemed incredibly unique. Two of which were cacti, one was a blooming hedgehog cactus, and the other a prickly pear cactus, both sat in large Egyptian urns and looked healthy and beautiful. Anubis watched as you and Karen looked around the room and he smiled then said,&quot;Karen, was it? I trust you to do your duty to your new queen, and I tryst that you know what that duty is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anubis snapped his fingers and a large bunch of neatly folded egyptian style materials appeared on the bed and Karen immediately took notice to them and she nodded to him. &quot;Of course, erm....anything else that you need my uh...lord?&quot; Anubis shook his head then he turned to you and said,&quot;My love, I wish for you to stay here for now until I return. Karen will care for you until then, and hopefully will have prepared for you some proper attire. I shall return with more servants wether they be willing or not. Be safe until then, and enjoy your time in our room until then.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and Anubis smiled then he walked off and as he did you saw a large ornate rug appear where bebeath your paws and it covered the large portion of the room that had nothing else on it. When Anubis left your sight you let out a sigh and you pulled the veil back to sit down on the bed. &quot;Wow, this is....unbelievable,&quot; You said and you looked over at Karen then asked her,&quot;Are you...okay with all of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen looked at you and shrugged then said,&quot;I...well, it’s interesting and I g...guess that I uh...am honored to serve you, my queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, we&#39;re friends so you don’t have to call me that, or at least since we’re in private you don’t.&quot; You said to her then she gave you a slight nod and said,&quot;I can’t believe this, but it’s.....kind of incredible really. Thanks by the way for The assist back there with erm....your husband? I think I’ll just refer to him as the king. So, if I may have permission to know, what exactly happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and looked down at your body then sighed and said,&quot;Long story short, I found him, and he uh....wanted a bride so he asked me and....uh...I said yes.&quot; You blushed and Karen nodded as she shifted through the materials of which she was given and she found some tools for sewing in between two different folded materials. Karen then walked over to you and she asked,&quot;Do you need anything? There’s uh...water and food over there. Also a jewelry box behind of it, and we&#39;ll probably use that headdress too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then you stood up and you gave Karen a puzzled look before you walked over to the table, and you saw behind the platter sat an ornate golden jewelry box, and besides that sat a headdress similar to one that you vaguely remember Cleopatra wore. &quot;Huh, I uh never noticed this until you pointed it out.&quot; You picked ip the Jewelry box then opened it up and you saw makeup as well as a bunch of small golden jewelry for you to wear. You looked at it for a few moments then saw that on the lid that, came off when opened, was a mirror and you saw your reflection and blushed. Karen walked over to you moments later and saw this and she looked at you. You felt almost bad for Karen, like she didn’t deserve to be your servant, so you turned to her and asked,&quot;Karen, do you blame me for accepting Anubis as my husband?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen paused looking shocked then she replied,&quot;What? No, of course I don’t. I’m actually happy for you as odd as it sounds, because you used to be a guy. But he kind of scares me, and there must have been a lot of pressure on you at the time.&quot; You nodded to Karen then said,&quot;It just feels so weird now, I mean this body, these feelings, this new life, I don’t think that I deserve it.&quot; Karen shrugged again then she said,&quot;Maybe, I know that some would agree with you, but personally I don’t mind this right now. Emily on the other hand or....paw probably would think that she deserves this. You also have to adjust to everything, and I do as well but not as much for me. You look great though as a woman, I think at least you do. Just uh, remember who I am as queen alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded then looked down at your nude body and blushed then Karen smiled and said,&quot;Yeah, and all things considered I should congratulate you on this, and your plans for the future.&quot; You looked at the quilt and blushed then you said,&quot;Y....Yeah, it will be....interesting. I am not sure that I&#39;m quite looking forward to that moment.&quot; Karen smiled then she walked behind you and began brushing your hair with her claws then she said,&quot;How about I help you adjust, one step at a time and one piece of jewelry at a time. You’re lucky that your ears are pierced already, and in....multiple places.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then glanced back at Karen as asked,&quot;Why did you use jewelry in that as stepping stones?&quot; Karen shrugged then said,&quot;I thought that we would work on makeup before I make you a dress. You sure have a lot of piercings in here a....oh.&quot; You looked back at Karen then you asked,&quot;What’s up?&quot; Karen walked around to your front then she started to examine your breasts and vagina and you blushed when she did then asked,&quot;Karen, why are you doing that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen let out a small whimper and she said,&quot;Well uh....you certainly have lots of places for piercings....on your uh.....va....*gulp* vagina.&quot; Your eyes widened at this then you looked at her blushing deeper and she said,&quot;It’s okay, we don’t have to do that area.....erm....unless you want to. What do you want to do?&quot;</p>
