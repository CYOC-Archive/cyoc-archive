<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday morning at the Knight estate, the sun shining in through the windows; with no curtains, one might think it would be easy to peer on inside. Yet the windows are polarized; tinted so that you can see outside with ease, yet looking inside was impossible. Great for those that are weres and want to walk about in their fursonas without being peeked upon.<br />
<br />
With the sun lighting up the bedroom; three weres snuggled and curled up with each other on a king sized bed. Each at peace and content; their furry arms wrapped around each other and their tails twitching softly. Both Spencer and Frieda sandwiching their white furred were panther Eric Anderson; their heads resting softly on his chest as he quietly purrs. Each sharing a dream none wish to end; yet slowly the dream of them together outside in their fursonas begins to fade.<br />
<br />
With all three waking up in unison; their vivid green eyes taking in the tender embrace each was in with each other. Eric was the first to move as he moves his paws to either girl’s furry hip and rubbing the fur softly.<br />
“What a wonderful dream that was,” Frieda purring; “the three of us in the woods…”<br />
“Eating a fresh buck,” Spencer continuing the line of thought; “with Eric here…”<br />
“…Feeling the tiny kicks of our cubs,” Eric purring; “coming from your swollen bellies.”<br />
“Are you feeling any better from last night,” Frieda asking; “are you still upset at having to kill that intruder?”<br />
<br />
Eric stopped rubbing his mates’ bodies as he thinks back on what the strange man said in his dream.<br />
‘Take comfort in the bond you share with Spencer and Frieda; they will be your rock in this troubled time you are feeling. Only with their help will you be able to heal the damage to your psyche. Talk to them; trust in what they have to say.’<br />
<br />
“I had an interesting dream prior to the one we clearly shared,” Eric responding; “it was that strange man that visited us all those months ago.”<br />
“What,” Spencer getting up with Frieda quickly following suit; “what did he say?”<br />
“What did he look like,” Frieda asking; “the same as before?”<br />
“First,” Eric sitting up; &quot;the strange man looked nothing like the last time we saw him. I can’t exactly place the face; but it was his eyes that creeped me out. They looked reptilian,” Eric staring at his mates; “almost draconic. He said just because we three have creepy eyes, doesn’t mean we have a monopoly over it. But we did talk about a few things.”<br />
“About what,” Spencer speaking as she stretched; her ears twitching as he maw opens up displaying the sharp teeth inside as she yawned.<br />
“About what happened last night,” Eric sighing; “I think he made me witness me killing that man. I could clearly hear his bones snap and shatter from my fist. It made me sick to my stomach,” Eric pauses for a moment before continuing; “he said that this will pass, but only if I talk to you both and trust what you have to say. That man also said,” Eric cracking a smile; “that our bond isn’t just for amazing sex.”<br />
<br />
“Well that’s easy to do,” Spencer helping Eric sit on the edge of the bed and joining him; “what is it you want to talk about?”<br />
“You had to take a life before,” Eric sighing; “how can you feel completely at ease for doing it? And it’s not as if we are talking about hunting for food. I’m referring to taking a human life.”<br />
“Fight or flight,” Spencer answers; “it’s an instinctive drive within us all. If your life is in danger, you are going to travel to one end of the spectrum or the other. For me fighting is easy,” Spencer placing a paw on Eric’s thigh; “my dad taught me to fight. When he was in the army, dad was always worried that something bad might happen to me or mom and wanted to make sure we could defend ourselves properly.”<br />
“Your dad taught your mother how to fight,” Frieda asking.<br />
“No,” Spencer chuckling; “mom can take care of herself. Dad was mostly worried over me. Me being an only child and all that.”<br />
“But now you have a brother,” Eric speaking.<br />
“That doesn’t change things,” Spencer speaking; “it only makes the drive to protect what you care about even greater. Now that I have a brother,” Spencer smiling; “I get to help dad in teaching him how to fight dirty.”<br />
“You mean like a marine,” Eric correcting spencer.<br />
“Same thing,” Spencer purring; “what I’m getting at is this. If your life is on the line, or something precious to you is in danger; you will do things you would never think of dong when not in danger. That is what you did last night,” Spencer stating; “you felt the cubs we were looking after were in danger and decided to protect them the best you could. “<br />
“And me feeling sick afterwards,” Eric asking.<br />
“A natural reaction most experience when having to kill,” Spencer answering; “I suggest you talk to my dad. He might give you some insight on what you are feeling.”<br />
<br />
“Taking down a buck or a rabbit is one thing,” Eric sighing; “but a human being?”<br />
“I might know something that could cheer you up,” Frieda speaking as she approached. Her paws holding onto something; Eric’s superb hearing could pick up the tiny squeaks coming from within, he instinctively licks his lips as he knows what Frieda is holding. Displaying a typical predatory glint a house cat has when face to face with a mouse; Eric was starting to growl in joy.<br />
“Is that a mouse you have in your paws,” Eric purring; “or are you just happy to see me?”<br />
“Haha,” Spencer laughing; “Don’t tell me your giving Eric a mouse we caught for Ralph now.”<br />
“Well,” Frieda dangling the tiny rodent in front of Eric and watching him easily snatch it up and gulp it down whole; “it was all I can think about. I figured if we let those predatory instincts of a large cat come through, it will help Eric get out of his funk.”<br />
“And what I said won’t,” Spencer looking cross; “don’t you think watching Eric eat mice is disgusting?”<br />
“Look at it this way Spencer,” Frieda speaking; “with the were-alert, we can’t exactly go hunting for something larger. Think of this as baby steps.”<br />
“And what would the next step be,” Spencer rolling her eyes in disgust.<br />
“Getting both of you to eat one,” Eric purring; “maybe throw caution to the wind and get some rabbit to snack on later today.”<br />
Frieda chuckles; “looks like Eric is feeling better. Perhaps we should go downstairs and get some breakfast.”<br />
<br />
“I have a better ideal,” Eric growling as he crawls back on the bed; “how about a morning round of hot sex instead?”<br />
“Yeah,” Spencer looking bemused; “Eric is back to normal. Well as normal as a horny were-panther can be…”<br />
“Me first,” Frieda gleefully pouncing on Eric; “let me at the hard shaft of yours.”<br />
<br />
“You going to watch Spencer,” Eric growling as he can feel Frieda riding his feline member; her vaginal clamping down on the barbed shaft, digging in as Eric eagerly thrusts in and out of her.<br />
“Oh what the hell,” Spencer climbing back on the bed to kiss Frieda as she gets orally pleasured from Eric with his tongue massaging and probing her quickly aroused sex.<br />
<br />
With the moaning and yowling emanating from the three horny were-teens; it wasn’t long before Eric came inside Frieda as she shuddered with her own orgasm. Wanting to switch spots; Frieda lies on the bed while Spencer crawls on top, the two female in a sixty nine position eager to lap each others blooming flower. Eric not one to be left out, mounts Spencer and proceeds to fill her with his seed.<br />
&#39;God dam,&quot; Eric thinks while a lust filled haze fills his head; &#39;this is the best kind of therapy a were-panther can get.&#39;</p>
