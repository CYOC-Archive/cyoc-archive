<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Finally,&quot; Jake said to himself as he read her text at 10 p.m. A true booty call.<br />
<br />
He had been dating Emma for over three months, and she wanted to &quot;take it slow.&quot; Normally, he wouldn&#39;t have put up with that, but her body was the hottest at the gym, a perfect 10 out of 10. He was willing to be patient to be the first one at his college to claim her.<br />
<br />
Luckily, he&#39;d showered after the gym, half-expecting this situation. He threw on his Gucci jeans, Loro Piana shoes, and Burberry T-shirt, finishing off the look with his GMT Rolex and a spritz of Dior Sauvage cologne, all paid for by his recent NIL deal. He stopped by the mirror, admiring his reflection. Truthfully, anything would look incredible on his muscular 6&#39;4&quot; frame.<br />
<br />
Jake jumped into his Ferrari and headed to Emma&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Despite being the head cheerleader, Emma preferred living off-campus with her parents instead of a sorority house. Her home was modest, a far cry from Jake&#39;s world of luxury, but he didn&#39;t care. The house was dark, the front yard bathed in moonlight.<br />
<br />
Emma opened the door, wearing a cherry-red teddy that hugged her curves perfectly. It showed off her ample cleavage and barely covered her tight bubble butt. She motioned for him to be quiet as she closed the door softly behind them. Her mom was out of town, and her dad was passed out on the living room recliner.<br />
<br />
Jake glanced at her dad, a man well past his prime, Jake had always been proud of his body. Standing at 6&#39;4&quot;, with broad shoulders and a sculpted, muscular build that spoke of hours spent in the gym, he carried himself with a natural confidence. His body was the result of hard work, dedication, and the benefits of being an elite athlete on campus. Every muscle on his frame was defined and toned, from his chiseled abs to his strong, lean legs. His chest and arms were impressive, showing off the result of countless hours lifting weights, and his posture alone exuded power and strength. It wasn&#39;t just the aesthetics of his physique, Jake&#39;s body functioned as well as it looked. He was built for performance, whether in sports or simply impressing the women around him.<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s dad, on the other hand, was a stark contrast. At 5&#39;7&quot;, he was much shorter than Jake, and his body bore the marks of years of neglect. His large frame was weighed down by excess fat, a far cry from the toned, defined bodies Jake surrounded himself with. His belly, which hung over the waistband of his pants, was soft and round, and his arms and legs were thick with the kind of weight that came from a sedentary lifestyle. His face was flush with redness, likely due to years of poor health and drinking, and his breath came out in labored puffs as he dozed in the recliner, seemingly oblivious to the contrast between him and the fit young man next to his daughter.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t just physical appearance that set them apart. While Jake&#39;s body was a reflection of discipline and focus, Emma&#39;s dad&#39;s body told a story of excess, indulgence, and missed opportunities. He had no muscle definition to speak of, and his movements were slow, lacking the fluidity that came with someone who took care of their body. He was past the prime of his youth, carrying the weight of a life that had slowly become more sedentary, his belly hanging over the arms of the chair, his hands resting on his swollen stomach.<br />
<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t help but wonder how a man like that could father a daughter like Emma, whose figure was the epitome of athletic perfection. It was a thought that lingered briefly, refocusing on the beautiful woman in the room, her figure just as sculpted as his own, but he brushed the thought aside, focusing instead on the tight red G-string peeking out from beneath her teddy as they headed upstairs.<br />
<br />
Emma playfully tried to cover herself, but it was futile. She knew exactly what she was doing.<br />
<br />
Jake was already semi-hard before they even entered her room. Pink mood lighting bathed the space, and he couldn&#39;t help but notice the plush bedspread, clearly picked out just for him. An unusual incense burned in the corner, its aroma sharp but not unpleasant.<br />
<br />
Emma reached up on her tiptoes, pulling him down for a kiss as she closed the door behind them. Her lips were soft and sweet, and Jake felt his confidence soaring.<br />
<br />
She stepped away, picking up a small blue pill from her nightstand and walking back to him with a sly grin. &quot;Here, take this,&quot; she cooed, placing it in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinky,&quot; Jake replied with a smirk. He never had trouble getting it up, but he wasn&#39;t one to turn down an enhancement for a good time. He reached for a White Russian sitting on her dresser to wash it down.<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s hand darted out, stopping him. &quot;No, not that one,&quot; she said with a mischievous smile. &quot;I&#39;ll make you a drink in a minute. For now, let me show you just how much I appreciate you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake raised an eyebrow at Emma&#39;s insistence, but her sultry smile melted away his reservations. He popped the pill into his mouth, dry swallowing it without hesitation. Emma grabbed his hand, leading him to her bed as her fingertips traced electric patterns on his skin. She had this way of making him feel like the center of the universe, and tonight, she was dialing it up to eleven.<br />
<br />
Emma sat him on the edge of her bed and climbed onto his lap, her thighs straddling his. Her red teddy clung to her like a second skin, the silky fabric teasing against his hands as they rested on her hips, leaving little to the imagination as she gently gyrated her pussy on his crotch. She kissed him deeply, her soft lips leaving him lightheaded. He leaned into her, his confidence swelling with every touch, every whispered tease.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really went all out for me, huh?&quot; Jake smirked, running his hands along her curves, settling on her incredible ass.<br />
<br />
Emma chuckled, brushing a strand of her golden hair from her face. &quot;Well, you&#39;re worth it. And tonight...&quot; She leaned in, her lips grazing his ear. &quot;Tonight, I want to show you just how much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake felt a jolt of anticipation, his heart racing. But beneath the haze of lust, something in the back of his mind nagged at him. Maybe it was the faintly acrid scent of the incense, or the way Emma had seemed a bit too eager for him to take that pill. He brushed it aside, chalking it up to nerves. This was the night he&#39;d been waiting for, no need to overthink it.<br />
<br />
She pulled back, her eyes twinkling mischievously as she slid off his lap. &quot;Stay right here,&quot; she purred, giving him a little dance as she dropped her teddy to the ground. Her firm DD breasts moved side to side with her dancing, only the tiny g string between himself and the rest of her body. Her movements were hypnotic, and Jake couldn&#39;t tear his eyes away as she bent slightly, unbuttoning his jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t know you could dance like that,&quot; Jake said, trying to sound casual, though his voice came out huskier than intended.<br />
<br />
Emma glanced up, her piercing green eyes looking directly into this soul, smirking. &quot;There&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t know about me, Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her words hung in the air, a mix of flirtation and something else he couldn&#39;t quite place. She pulled his jeans down, his massive cock was already fully hard and poking through his silk boxers. She didn&#39;t even try to remove them as she grabbed his shaft and worked her lips over his glands. &quot;To us,&quot; she said, before working his bulbous head into her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;To us,&quot; Jake echoed, leaning back as she worked inch by inch into her throat. He had never felt anything like it. The moment her lips passed his head, he felt an intense suction almost like he was getting pulled into her throat. He felt a warmth spread through his chest, evident that the pill was having an effect.<br />
<br />
Emma looked back up at him as her nose met his stomach, his head was still tilted back but he could somehow see her? He realized he was having a dissociative experience, between the pill and the incense, he felt like he was hovering over his body. Emma peaked directly at his &quot;ghost&quot;, her eyes locking onto his with an intensity that sent shivers down his spine. She remained at his stomach, his thick nine inch cock still buried in her, but the suction was growing stronger.<br />
<br />
Jake felt the world tilt slightly, the edges of his vision softening. A strange sensation began to creep through his body, not unpleasant, but strong. His muscles, usually taut with energy, felt loose, almost too relaxed. He grabbed onto the sheets trying to regain his strength, but his grip weakened with every passing second. His &quot;ghost&quot; was now being pulled back into his body as his vision began to weaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma...&quot; he started, his eyes closed, his voice slurring slightly. &quot;What was in that pill?&quot;<br />
<br />
She tilted her head, her smile no longer playful but something else entirely, sinister, as she remained on his cock.<br />
<br />
Her hands slid under his shirt, her nails grazing his abs, but Jake&#39;s focus wavered. He tried to protest but he was unable to move. All of his strength had left his arms as it traveled through his limbs down to his cock. Same with his head. He could no longer see or speak, his essence traveling through his body down to his crotch. His chest and abs lost all feeling slowly after she had started to scratch him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma...&quot; he tried again, his words contained to his &quot;mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
She slowly began to pull off of his cock, it felt like his soul was being ripped from his body coupled with an orgasm. Her lips remained on his glands as he pushed past the point of no return. His cock began to release his seed, but instead of enjoying his orgasm, it left him feeling untethered. As the edges of his consciousness began to blur, his cock ejected his soul along with his nut, a perfect mixture of his essence, directly into Emma&#39;s awaiting mouth.<br />
<br />
He was contained in darkness as she stood up, moving about the room. She brought an empty glass to her mouth and began to release his &quot;soul.&quot; Jake regained his vision, a murky white liquid within a small clear glass. Emma placed it on her dresser, directly next to the other White Russian from earlier. The only difference being his essence taking up less than half the glass compared to the other concoction. His body laid motionless on her bed, breathing heavily just like her dad in the recliner. Jake tried to scream but was unable to make a sound as Emma grabbed the other glass, carrying it to his body and placing it against his lips. Jake realized too late that he might&#39;ve underestimated the girl in the cherry-red teddy.</p>
