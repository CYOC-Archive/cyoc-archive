<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary stood spellbound for a moment, jaw still hanging open. Aisha would have laughed at her reaction if she wasn&#39;t unsure at what Mary would say next. Was Mary angry? Jealous? Confused? Aisha opened her mouth to speak, but was interrupted by Mary, whose open mouth was turning into a smile. &quot;Oh, wow! Ash, holy crap... Are you kidding me? They look awesome!&quot; Aisha smiled, happy to know that Mary&#39;s reception to the change was positive. Mary continued to look at them, clearly enthralled by their size. &quot;Where did you get them done? They look so natural!&quot; Aisha&#39;s smile fell slightly. &quot;Oh. Um, no. No, I, uh, didn&#39;t get a boob job. This is just how they are now.&quot; Mary blushed deep crimson. &quot;OH GOD. I&#39;M SO SORRY. Of course, I mean, you wouldn&#39;t. You wouldn&#39;t need that. It&#39;s just... How is that even possible? When you left for work last morning you weren&#39;t nearly this big- Er, sorry. No offense.&quot; &quot;None taken. Yeah, I know. But I think that it-&quot; Aisha thought briefly about telling Mary about the locket. But what if Mary wanted to use it? Aisha had no problem with that, but if she let Mary use it, where would the line be drawn? Someone else would want to use it next if they found out about it, then someone else, and so on. As far as Aisha was concerned, she was holding a Ring of Power in the pocket of her pajama bottoms, and she intended to keep it secret. Keep it safe.<br />
<br />
Aisha continued speaking, not wanting to raise too much suspicion out of her friend. &quot;Um, I think it just HAPPENED, you know? I get that it&#39;s weird, but that&#39;s just it. Nothing happened except..... Well, it happened.&quot; Mary folded her arms, smiling. &quot;You sure you weren&#39;t bitten by a radioactive bug at some client&#39;s house? Exposed to Gamma rays? Exposed to a yellow sun?&quot; Aisha chuckled. She normally hated when Mary used pop cultural references in casual conversation (as, unlike Aisha, she never watched any of the same TV shows or movies and never read the same comics or books and only knew about them from Aisha telling her about them), but something about this time felt funny and cute. &quot;No, I&#39;m sure I would remember that. But, seriously, I just woke up and-&quot; She squeezed her breasts for added effect. &quot;Poof.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary opened her mouth to speak, but was interrupted by the fire alarm going off above her. On the stove, the frying pan with bacon and sausage she had left on it had burned its contents into fiery char. After a few minutes of fanning the smoke out the kitchen window and running the pan under some cold water, Mary slumped over on the nearby counter. &quot;DAMN IT! Oh, God, I&#39;m so sorry, Aisha. I woke up, I saw what you did for me, I know you love bacon, and so I wanted to surprise you, and- God, I&#39;m so sorry for-&quot; Aisha put a hand on her best friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Hey, hey. It&#39;s fine! Look, were you really doing this just for me! That&#39;s awesome! Thank you! The sentiment is more than enough. And besides, it&#39;s not your fault. It&#39;s-&quot; She clasped her breasts once more and said in a comedically deep voice with a forced serious expression, &quot;their fault&quot;. Mary laughed and playfully punched her arm. &quot;Heh. But, no, seriously, what are we going to do about breakfast now?&quot; Aisha thought, and came up with a plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we go to the mall? It&#39;s 9:47, right? They&#39;ve been open for over a half hour now. I was being serious when I asked you to come with me to go bra shopping. I&#39;d like the company and artistic advice on the pattens.&quot; Mary rolled her eyes, chuckling. &quot;Ash, don&#39;t say that. It&#39;s not like I would know what-&quot;. Aisha continued. &quot;Hey, Mary, I mean it. I need new clothes since...&quot; She motioned to her exposed navel. &quot;My old ones won&#39;t fit above my waist anymore. So, we go there in a few minutes, and while we&#39;re there we can get breakfast somewhere along with the clothes. Sound good?&quot; Mary nodded. &quot;Sure, but on one condition: I pay for breakfast AND your clothes.&quot; Aisha sighed. Here she went again. Mary was always offering to pay for everything (it was a miracle Aisha talked her down to paying for half the rent of the house), and while Aisha appreciated the sentiment, it worried her. Mary was a talented artist, at least in Aisha&#39;s eyes, but didn&#39;t make as much money as she did. And even then, with clients like the ones she had, Aisha only barely managed to live above average wage. On top of the personal debt Mary had collected over the years with alcohol, Aisha was worried that her friend&#39;s life savings would be diminished before next year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, no. Please, I-&quot; &quot;Okay. Okay. I understand. Maybe too much. I&#39;ll pay for half the breakfast and all the clothes, deal?&quot; Aisha stood firm, her inner negotiation skills surfacing. &quot;I pay for breakfast, I pay for the clothes.&quot; Mary though for a second. She wasn&#39;t about to let dear Aisha shop with her hard-earned money alone over something that just happened overnight, outside her control. &quot;Half breakfast, half clothes. Deal?&quot; Aisha opened her mouth to argue, but she stomach rumbled. The bacon she had smelt cooking before it got burned had smelled so good and task. So juicy, warm, flavorful, chewy... Aisha&#39;s mouth began to water, and her stomach rumbled so more. She could be here all day trying to negotiate with Mary on this, and the mall wouldn&#39;t stay open all day. No mall meant no food. Aisha connected the dots, and reluctantly gave in. &quot;Okay, fine. How about.... We got half on breakfast, and I pay for the clothes. Deal?&quot; Mary nodded, and stuck out her hand. &quot;It&#39;s a deal, Miss Nakama.&quot; Aisha gently slapped her hand away. She hated whenever Mary acted like one of her clients, and she DESPISED it when she used her last name. Aisha could forgive it if it was Mary.<br />
<br />
As Mary got dressed in her room, Aisha put on a pair of jeans, some socks, some sneakers (outside of her business pantsuits, Aisha was quite the actuals dresser), and wore a large sweatshirt over her shirt which covered her navel when zipped up halfway. However, it did little to contain her chest, though Aisha now failed to see this as a problem. How my sense of modesty had changed since she got off the bus last night, she thought curiously. Once more, she thought about how her brain might have been affected in a similar way as her breasts were because of that girl, but such thoughts were interrupted by Mary calling her name. Aisha grabbed her purse with her wallet in it, headed downstairs, and joined Mary as they walked to the front door, who was wearing a similar getup with a baseball hat on and a letterman jacket instead of a sweatshirt. They would take the bus to the mall, and it was due to arrive in roughly eight or so minutes. More than enough time, as the bus stop was just a short walk from their house, especially during the daytime. Before she could open the door, however, Aisha was stopped by Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um..... Hey, Ash?&quot; &quot;Yeah? You okay, Mary?&quot; &quot;..... No, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s stupid. It&#39;s nothing. I don&#39;t even know why- Nothing.&quot; Aisha smiled warmly. &quot;No. Go on. What&#39;s up?&quot; Mary looked away, blowing air out of her mouth. &quot;This..... This is going to sound weird but..... No. Forget it.&quot; &quot;Mary, it&#39;s okay. What-?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, can I squeeze your boobs? Like, under the shirt? I&#39;MSOSORRY. YOUCANSAYNO. I&#39;M SORRY. I don&#39;t know why- I&#39;m sorry!&quot;</p>
