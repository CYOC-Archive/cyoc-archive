<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You click on the transformation button. It says &#39;are you sure?&#39; You press yes. You are redirected to another page which reads &#39;Thank you for your cooperation. You will be transformed by another person.&#39; You shudder. Your fate is now sealed. You&#39;re at the mercy of some random. <br />
<br />
A few minutes pass. You keep the website open while you browse Facebook. A notification sound plays. You look at the tab. It&#39;s flashing. You open the page and it reads. &#39;Your transformation will start soon.&#39;<br />
<br />
It seems like this is taking forever.  It&#39;s the start of the weekend, your parents are gone, and your neighbor isn&#39;t going to check on you until after dinner.  You decide to take a shower because it feels like it&#39;s getting stinking hot.  When you get soaped up, everything feels slick and you start feeling horny.  Your dick starts growing harder, and it feels like it&#39;s stretching a lot and your balls begin hurting... no amount of rubbing with soap seems to be helping, and it&#39;s getting a lot bigger, as are your balls... this is the change?  What the hell.  You&#39;ve lost track of how long you were standing here with sliding soap on your dick. It&#39;s clear you&#39;re not going to get an orgasm soon, and the water&#39;s gotten cold, but you don&#39;t really feel it.  You realize that something else is weird... all the hair on your body has washed off and down the drain.  Your mom will probably yell about you clogging it up but you can&#39;t really do anything about it now.<br />
<br />
You get out of the shower and towel off and look in the mirror because it&#39;s huge and you can&#39;t really avoid it.  Your body looks different. Besides a dick that looks like it&#39;s twice the size it should be -- you never really looked at your own hard-on that much before so it might not be, maybe it&#39;s because of the lack of hair -- but clearly, somebody is changing you. Which is cool except that blue-balls are beginning to be a THING in your life. Your muscles are showing a bit more, which isn&#39;t because of body hair because you didn&#39;t have that much to begin with.  Your layer of baby-fat seems to have gone.  And you itch and hurt.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a whewp-ping-fwee noise as you walk into your bedroom with the towel wrapped futilely across your hard-on, wishing it would decide whether to feel good or hurt.  That&#39;s your text message noise.  You have three messages, one from your neighbor saying she heard you in the shower and she&#39;ll check in the morning but call if you need anything, and another from your friend Liam saying &quot;Sorry, someone got to it first.&quot;   And then the third from Ronald Barks.  Your personal bully.  Ronald is two years older than you are and he&#39;s in the same grade because he was in juvie for a year.  That was a good year.  He likes to give you a hard time about being a wimp, and he calls you faggot all the time (though you&#39;ve had two girlfriends and nobody remembers him ever having any) and he likes to punch you in the arm when you&#39;re not looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come over to my place, faggot. Or spend the night with blue balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not good. But it&#39;s getting worse, so you pull on a tee-shirt -- which is too tight? Really? This was loose last week.<br />
And your smallest jock from freshman year because the waistband is small enough to hold your erection against your waist, and then you pull on your sweatpants, which are baggy enough, but not as much as you remember from yesterday.<br />
<br />
You call the neighbor and say that you&#39;re going to a classmate&#39;s house to get some homework and you&#39;ll be back by ten.<br />
And then you go to Ronald&#39;s place.  It&#39;s a dump, which you expected.  His mom left years ago, and his dad&#39;s pretty much never there, and when he is, it&#39;s with his biker gang buddies.   You knock on the door, and Ronald yells, &quot;Come on in, faggot.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s strangely clean and not run-down inside. The hall light is on and Ronald yells, &quot;IN HERE,&quot; so you go to the room at one end of the hall with the door open.  Ronald&#39;s grinning like a creep and he&#39;s wearing boxing gloves and trunks.  He&#39;s four or five inches taller than you, and built like a heavyweight boxer ten years older than he really is.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; you ask him, and he says, &quot;I saw your name come up on the website, faggot. You might&#39;ve noticed I got to you before anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
He jabs you in the arm with one fist, fast and hard... and instead of the blistering dull pain you usually feel, it&#39;s just a sort of hard thud that actually feels kind of good.  You&#39;re not even shoved back like you usually are.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you do, Ron?&quot; You never called him Ron. Nobody was allowed to call him Ron.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were always so perfect. I had such a thing for you when we were kids but you always cried and ran off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  You brace yourself as he hits you with a sudden, fast one-two-three to the chest and stomach.  Again it&#39;s harder than you&#39;ve felt before, but it doesn&#39;t hurt at all.  Just a quick sting and then it feels ... good?  Ron grins at you again, and it&#39;s half evil and half something else that you don&#39;t really want to think about.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my training faggot now.  Nothing anyone can do will hurt you, and hitting you actually makes you, well, you&#39;ll find out.  I&#39;ll teach you to fight back later, but first, just stand there and be my punching dummy for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
You want to just leave but you realize that you can&#39;t really move.  And then he starts punching harder, hitting you everywhere, but there&#39;s no blood, no pain at all, you just sort of soak it up in that warm pleasant feeling that starts to reach down into your aroused dick and then he hits you, hard, in the nuts, and it&#39;s like all the pain is turned inside out and you almost come.  You gasp, and he keeps grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like that?  You&#39;ll have to wait for another.&quot;  He goes behind you and starts pummeling your back, shoulders, your butt, he even starts some karate kicks to your legs and shins.  The heat is all over you and you feel like you&#39;re going to burst, your shirt is already tearing a little but you&#39;re stuck, almost rigid, feeling more and more aroused until he comes to your front side again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what being my training faggot is like, buddy,&quot; he says, and you&#39;re about to go nuts but you can&#39;t talk, and he punches you some more in front and your too-tight teeshirt bursts open. Then he punches you again, hard, in the nuts, and the world goes white-hot as you feel an orgasm that engulfs your entire body.  And another punch.  And another.  It doesn&#39;t stop. You can&#39;t see anything, you can only feel the sensations.<br />
<br />
And then he gasps himself, and shudders and grabs onto your shoulders and kisses you.<br />
<br />
When you can see again, you&#39;re standing still and Ronald is half laughing, half crying,  leaning and hanging on your body.<br />
<br />
You can move again. You lift him up and put him on his bed.  You see yourself in the mirror on his closet door.  You&#39;re still you, sort of, but your muscles have grown and sculpted like some sort of action figure or comic book hero.  Your dick is still huge, but not so painfully insistent.  It hasn&#39;t really gone soft.  Your voice works again.<br />
<br />
Ron is still half laughing, half crying. You sit on the bed next to him and wipe off the tears from one side of his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go home. My neighbor will expect me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ron is exhausted, but he looks at you and says, &quot;No, stick around for a little more, faggot.  There&#39;s more changes coming.&quot;</p>
