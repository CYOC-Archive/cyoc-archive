<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie could see the years in Mary&#39;s eyes as she approached. Obviously disappointed by her friends response Mary Elise didn&#39;t know what to do. Katie now tried to comfort her friend. &quot;You okay Mary,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise wiped a tear for her eyes ans looked at Katie. &quot;No,&quot; she moaned. &quot;I wanted to share this experience with her more than anything. I know that this wouldn&#39;t last forever but it would have been nice to experience our childhood for one more day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could try explaining that to her,&quot; Katie stated. &quot;Maybe she&#39;ll change her mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise shok her head sadly and managed a weak smile. &quot;No, if there&#39;s one thing I know about Claudia it&#39;s that once she makes up her mind she won&#39;t change it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls now looked down at the floor as Claudia slowly began to wake up. &quot;Katie,&quot; Mary Elise asked. &quot;I need you to do something for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything,&quot; Katie said grasping her hand. <br />
<br />
Mary Elise looked back at Claudia with a mournful look. &quot;Change Claudia, make her ten again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Katie was stunned by Mary&#39;s answer. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; She asked. Mary Elise shook her head yes before looking Katie dead in the eye. &quot;Yes and when she&#39;s ten again I want you to make me and her mentally ten again just like the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Isn&#39;t their another way.&quot; Mary had a solemn look on her face and shook her head no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry there&#39;s no other way.  I don&#39;t want ther to be any friction between me and Claudia and when we do this there will be. Plus I don think I could live with the knowledge that I intentionally hurt her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls now looked at each other with a sad look on there face. &quot;I&#39;m going to miss you,&quot; Katie said. Mary Elise smiled and gave Katie a weak hug. &quot;Don&#39;t ill still be here I just won&#39;t remember everything that happened tonight.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Katie lightly pushed her friend. &quot;You know what I mean,&quot; she giggled. &quot;I know,&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;Now let&#39;s do this.&quot; With that Katie wished for Claudia to become ten.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise approache the the grown Claudia who was now slowly getting out of bed. Dressed only in a tight cotton shirt and panties she stretched her arms over her head causing her large b cup breasts to push upwards. Claudia now looked over at the sullen red head slowly walking towards her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mary,&quot; Claudia said with a smile. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this is actually happening, I mean look at you, your...your so young. Just a kid you can&#39;t be more than what nine, ten it&#39;s incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary gave a weak smile as she looked at Claudia and noticed the regression was starting. Already Claudia had regressed to 23. Her blonde hair seemed to glow and her skin glowed with youth. &quot;It&#39;s really been a lot of fun Claudia,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a little frightening at first but it&#39;s feels like such a rush. I can&#39;t explain it wish you would change your mind, I mean it&#39;s not like we would have to grow up all over again we can change back tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now 22 Claudia shook her head and looked at the adorable red head in front of her. &quot;No Mary,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s not right. We can&#39;t go back like that even for a night. Growing up was hard enough and I made so many mistakes when I was young. Trying to relive my youth wouldn&#39;t be right. I&#39;m happy. I married a wonderful man. He treated me so well...even though he&#39;s passed on he gave three beautiful children and even more grandchildren. I can&#39;t go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise began to cry as she continued to watch her friend regress. Claudia was now only 20 and the signs of regression were beginning to become obvious. She had been selfish in wanting this not taking Claudia&#39;s feelings into account. Now she watched as her friend began the slow descent to childhood without her knowledge. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Claudia,&quot; Mary Elise moaned. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you felt this way. I only wanted my friend again....maybe you should go look in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Puzzled Claudia walked over to the dresser mirror and looked over her reflection. Slowly a look of horror spread across her face as she recognized her 19 year old reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re making me younger!&quot; Claudia exclaimed as she spun on her heel to confront the small girl. &quot;Why Mary, why would you do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia grasped the young girl by the shoulder and tried to get the mournful girl look into her eyes. Mary Elise could only look at the floor not wanting to look into the taller girls eyes. She felt guilty and childish for what she had done. Her only solace was that when the regression was complete neither one would remember this when it was over.<br />
<br />
Now only 18 Claudia looked over her appearance. The curves of her twenties had all but vanished. Now only a high school senior she possessed a thin waist with perky b cup breasts. Her formerly tight shirt was now a little loose on her covering her cute rear and flat stomach. Her panties were also beginning to become a little loose forcing her to pull them up as they began to slide.<br />
<br />
As Claudia became 17 she shrank a little. Mary Elise, who was only up to her chest seemed to grow taller as she became younger. While she was still upset with Mary Elise for doing this she was starting to feel bad for the girl. Mary Elise was still crying softly as Claudia got younger. Her tear stained face and swollen eyes gave her a look of innocence, making it hard to stay mad at the young girl. Claudia smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t cry Mary,&quot; a now 16 year old Claudia said. Claudia cleared her throat she hadn&#39;t expected to sound so young. &quot;I forgive you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise looked up at her friend with tear stained eyes. &quot;Really?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;I think I understand why. I wish you would have respected my choice but I don&#39;t want you to cry. You&#39;ve always been my best friend and always will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise hugged a now 15 year old Claudia. Claudia sighed and returned her hug before turning to the mirror. She winced as she saw how young she looked. She had lost most of curves with her breasts reduced to a pair of a cups. She had already shrunk several inches and found she was only a head taller than Mary Elise. Claudia thought back to how she had wished for bigger boobs as a kid and smiled. Even with a small chest she had still been a very popular child in high school. Now looking down at her friend she began to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just couldn&#39;t let me be the tall one for once huh,&quot; she laughed as she ruffled Mary Elise&#39;s bright red hair. &quot;Guess I should enjoy the view while I can. In a minute or two I&#39;ll be looking up at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled as Claudia began a skinny but attractive 14 year old. Claudia had always been a cheerleader throughout school and her trim athletic body showed all the traing she had gone through as a kid. Mary noticed her shirt was now beginning to slide down her legs stopping at mid theigh. As Claudia became 13 her breasts retracted into a pair of puffy nipples, Claudia sighed and grabbed her chest. &quot;Ugh I hated being a late bloomer,&quot; she whined. &quot;Just about every other girl had breasts in seventh grade. Do you have any idea how much it sucks being flat at 13.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary shook her head no and hugged her friend closer. The top of Mary&#39;s head now rested just below Claudia&#39;s nose. She had forgotten how uncomfortable Claudia had been as a young teen. Mary Elise had gone through puberty a little earlier than some of the other girls in her class it made things a little strained between the two but they remained friends.<br />
<br />
As Claudia becam 12 she continued to shrink. Now only a couple of inches taller than Mary Elise the girls looked at eachother and began to laugh. Claudia looked down at her feet and began to wiggle her toes. She couldn&#39;t believe how small she was becoming. Her formerly tight shirt now fell to her knees. &quot;Well you were right about one thing,&quot; she said. &quot; this definitely felels weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Claudia became 11 she found herself a little shorter than her Mary. Claudia frowned as she looked up at Mary but smiled. &quot;Well this feels a little more natural. It didn&#39;t feel right having to look down to see you. You&#39;ve always been a little taller than me. I always hated that.&quot; Claudia crinkled her nose and playfully punched Mary Elise in the shoulder.<br />
<br />
The two friends laughed as Claudia became 10. She shrank another few inches with the hem of her shirt now falling past her knees. The two friends smiled at eachother and hugged. &quot;Welcome back Claudia,&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;Thanks for joining the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie had watched the whole thing take place from the side. She was glad the two friends had been able to work out their differences. Claudia was now a beautiful young blonde girl with long blond hair descending to her shoulders. Looking over the young blonde girl Katie guessed that as pretty and angelic as she looked she was probably in child beauty pageants when she was this age. The two friends seemed to be getting along well enough by Katie knew she had one more wish to make.<br />
<br />
Wishing the two friends to be mentally ten she watched as a glazed look came over their eyes. After a moment Mary Elise and Claudia blinked their eyes and looked around the room. Katie had done it. Both girls now thought of themselves as having always been ten. A single tear rolled down Katie&#39;s cheek. Her secret was safe once again but the girl she had know over the past few hours was gone. Now it was time to reintroduce herself.</p>
