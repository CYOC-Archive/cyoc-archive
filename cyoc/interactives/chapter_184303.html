<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unknown to Lindsay moments before she transformed in a nearby dorm room Oscar sat on the top bed of a bunk bed waiting for his roommate to just leave. The two of them where totally different and unlike Lindsay who got along great with her sister Barbara even though they where totally different he and his roommate hated each other. His roommate was load, pushy and basically a muscle brut who liked to push the nerdy Oscar around. <br />
<br />
“I will need you out of here by 11 or so.” Stated his roommate as he prepared to leave checking himself in a full length mirror on the back of the door, every dorm room seamed to have that mirror. Oscar knew what meant, his roommate planned to bring a girl home and that he would spend a night sleeping out in the common room….again. Oscar didn’t respond just looked at him. “Did you hear me, because if you are in here I will make you pay.”<br />
<br />
“I heard you.” Confirmed Oscar as his roommate left. Oscar turned back to his laptop and pulled up social media, his heart was racing a bit as he looked at Lindsay’s profile. He had gone with his old high school friend James to his girlfriend’s house just to have more time with his crush and he hadn’t used that time well. He considered sending her a message seeing if she wanted to hang out, she said she was going to spend the night at home, maybe they could go out for drinks. But he was horrible at holding down alcohol and was underage on top of that. He knew he could find some but he was also a worry wart and overthinker. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I should….” Said Oscar as he felt warm, he moved his hand to the back of his neck not knowing that a seal which had been placed there by the breaking of the shard was now glowing and his body was changing. <br />
<br />
His eyes focused on Lindsay’s image as a rush of hormones and thoughts entered his mind coming from the seal itself. He laid back as he began to masturbate. As he did he focused on Lindsay’s image inside his mind, dreaming fantasying about her green eyes, great body and her fun personality. That fun personality would be great in the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Lost in his dream the transformation began, his body grew, he was never tall but he wasn’t short either….he was tall now having grown 3 to 4 inches. He kicked off his shoes which fell to the title floor with a thud but he didn’t care as pads began to form on his feet and his hands. His body began to add muscle, not a lot but more then enough to crush the jock that his roommate was, if he had been looking, he would say he had a swimmer’s body lean but all muscles. His arms lengthened as black spots began to appear with brownish tan centers. The rest of his skin began to grow fur as well mostly the brownish color of his own human hair but with a lighter tan mixed. White fur grew over the bottom of his face, down his neck, over his chest and down to his now larger member. He was so lost in his pleasure he didn’t notice his ears shifting or his face pushing out into a short muzzle. He let out a small roar as two very large fangs grew out of the top of his mouth with a shorter pair coming in from the bottom. A long tail grew out his now busted pair of shorts, his shirt was also ripped by his increase in size but none of that bothered him.  <br />
<br />
He was breathing heavily, still looking at Lindsay’s image as he rolled off the bed and landed on all fours with a soft thump, he felt so powerful, much more powerful than he ever felt before. He turned still on all fours to look at the mirror, a big cat stared back at him, a jaguar or maybe a leopard he wasn’t sure but it…no he was powerful and strong. It was him, he stood up, he seamed as at home on four legs as on top and looked at himself in the mirror. It was him. What had he become.<br />
<br />
What was he going to do now, his mind was made up for him when he heard through the door someone walking down the hall and judging by the smell which he could also detect through the door it was his roommate coming back. He couldn’t be seen like this, not until he knew what he was going to do. With no time to waste he opened the window to their 4th floor dorm and without missing a beat he jumped. <br />
<br />
His roommate listening to music never even noticed the destroyed cloths on the floor or the missing Oscar, he never heard the thump as Oscar landed on all fours again four stories down in the darkening college green. His new cat like body took the fall with ease and it didn’t even hurt. Lucky no one was around and he was able to get into some thick bushes which grew beside a nearby dorm. <br />
<br />
“Now what….” Said Oscar in a deeper but still his voice as he decided what to do next.</p>
