<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess arrived at the soccer pitch, panting. She’d sprinted the last little while, and thankfully the girls were still only arriving.<br />
“It’s not like you to be late Jess?” Came a familiar voice from behind her. She turned and saw Zoe behind her. She too was dressed in the sports gear of the soccer team, with a sports bag over her shoulder. Jeff had previously known Zoe quite well, they’d been partners in various classes throughout their time in school and had spent more time in class with Zoe than probably anyone else. They were ok friends, but that’s all it had ever been as once class had finished they’d always parted ways and gone with their respective friends. Jeff had, of course, considered asking Zoe out, but there had always been cheerleaders and other buxom girls that he’d lusted after, and Zoe had always been just there as a friend, a solid constant. In truth she’d probably been secretly his reason for choosing Soccer Girl on the Chronivac.<br />
Zoe was shorter than Jess, with a tomboyish hair cut, brown, cut really short. It looked cute on her and Jeff had always thought she looked great with it. She’d started to grow it out a bit once but Jeff of all had convinced her to keep it short. She was well built, thin, but with a terrific hour glass figure considering her size. She had a cute nose and smile that was plain and simple, and betrayed no hidden agenda or any malice. Jess smiled at her apologetically. “Hey Zoe! Sorry, I got kinda’ tied up in something.” Jess apologized.<br />
Zoe giggled as she Jess onwards. “Fine. Let’s hurray up and dump our kit in the changing rooms. Coach won’t want her captain wasting time.” That was right, Jess was the captain. The Chronivac had provided her with enough soccer experience that Jess was the star player. She was also really likeable, something the Chronivac had not provided for her. Not long later she was charging down the pitch, feeling the freedom of the wind in her hair, and the speed and power that her toned and fit body provided her. She felt streamlined, sleek, something that before she’d never considered herself, or even experienced. Jeff had tried out for a few sports teams, but all the ones that required power he’d been too small or weak to join, and everything else involved a skill or finesse he just didn’t possess. Now, as Jess, he powered along the pitch, captain of the girls soccer team, its star play, and currently on for a goal.<br />
The opposing team was also members of the soccer team, but the striker for it was Millie, a nasty girl who, whilst a skillful player, equally as fit, was also dirty player. She didn’t care who’s shins she had to break to get a goal, and her black heart, both on and off the pitch was matched only by her jet black hair. <br />
Millie was to Jess’ right, covering that attack, and another player was on the center line blocking Jess from heading down the center line, or to her left. Jess was fast running out of options. Zoe with a fierce burst of speed shot past down the line between the two defenders. Jess seized the opportunity and flicked the ball across to Zoe. With a rebound off her petite chest followed by a strike the ball sailed past the goalie and into the net. The winning team all shouted there approval and Jess pumped the air with her fist. Zoe turned with a look of glee on her face and that should have been the end of it. It wasn’t however. Zoe face turned to a look of true pain as her shin was taken out from underneath her by a slide tackle from Millie. Zoe crumpled onto the ground and the whole team looked utterly dumbfounded. <br />
The coach blew the whistle and the game came to a close then and there. Zoe was taken off on a stretcher and practice was cut short with Millie being held behind by the coach whilst the rest of the girls, with the obvious exception of Zoe headed for the showers.<br />
Jess sat and stared at the floor in the changing room. The other girls one by one went for a shower, and though the thought of looking at their naked bodies was enticing, Jess’ heart wasn’t really in it. Instead she waited. Soon she was the only one left and she felt her hand grip the Chronivac from its resting place in her bag. It didn’t matter to her that this was her new life, Zoe was her friend through both, and Millie was going to pay.</p>
