<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You seem to be doing quite well, Roxanne,&quot; Dr. Swarzz commented in one of the therapy rooms in Doctor Jones&#39; clinic.<br />
<br />
Much of the clinic was set up to help with couples therapy originally and soon expanded to include cases that dealt with Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder after some of those cases began occurring. They weren&#39;t lethal or truly life threating, but it had been noticed that certain converted Animalians, and particularly those that were older before their conversion seemed the most likely to suffer from the condition. The case load had been such that Doctor Jones had to expand his practice to carry the case load that came with it. Doctor Swarzz was among those who came to help, and while a lot of his experience was more in dealing with those suffering from Depression or Bi-Polar Disorder, he had brought in some techniques and tools that did help some of the Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder patients keep more control over themselves, which was a good thing.<br />
<br />
And as he looked to the brown furred goat-like Animalian female relax on the couch, there were some times where he felt some of his original training and practices came in far more than the work with those suffering from Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder. She wore a pair of purple wind-pants, which allowed only her ankles and feet to be seen, and a light cotton shirt had the Horizon logo on its chest. She breathed calmly and steadily, which was good and her head and ears weren&#39;t constantly twitching about, which was also good. It kept her decent sized horns from bumping into anything. Though, if what he was told was true that this Animalian was an Alpine Ibex, it would mean that when compared to a male of that species, her horns were rather small.<br />
<br />
From the paperwork that he&#39;d gotten, Doctor Swarzz had gotten the sense that the Alpine Ibex Animalian, Roxanne, had converted to deal with some post-traumatic stress issues, and that actually fit in with what he&#39;d worked with before. That was why Roxanne&#39;s case was assigned directly to him. Their first session had ben a short one and one in which Roxanne gave him some background information and what had been the cause of her issues, or at least what she felt the cause to be. It was extensive, despite not being from a scenario where most people would expect a PTSD case to from, but Roxanne had actually stated that her conversion had actually helped with all that. And it was that that this second session was working with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... your suggested exercises were a bit helpful,&quot; Roxanne answered, &quot;but... really... I think a lot of the credit goes to a friend of mine and my conversion. Everything didn&#39;t heal right away... and there are some memories that are still painful... but once I became an Alpine Ibex Animalian... I did feel much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if we could pick up where you left off before...&quot; Doctor Swarzz asked slowly, to which Roxanne nodded and soon began to recount...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Roxanne was fairly nervous as she parked her car in front of Horizon&#39;s main labs. She&#39;d lived in fear for too long over people getting needlessly aggressive against her for the slightest of mistakes. She&#39;d long thought that the rapper that come into the shop WANTED the word &quot;Fresh&quot; cut into his hair. She didn&#39;t know that &quot;fresh&quot; was just some knew slang word for a hairstyle that the school for hairdressing, be it for men or women didn&#39;t use. The rapper&#39;s distraught reaction and the anger of his friends lead to her being fired on the spot, after only just getting her license and she ended up having to run to a policeman to avoid being beat up by the rapper&#39;s friends. From there, she&#39;d been on the road and working rather menial cleaning jobs just to make ends meet.<br />
<br />
She was surprised to get a call from Anne with an offer for help with everything if she came to Lyre/Animalia. It was a place that seemed the polar opposite of what she&#39;d tried to be over the past few years. Everything seemed to stand out and the Animalians seemed more than happy to draw attention to themselves in some way. For some it was to show how muscular or athletic they were. For some it was to simply show how sexy they were or at least to show how Animal forms and Human forms &quot;combined.&quot; And she&#39;d heard enough about Animalia that a lot of these things went on during the summer and that is what made her nervous. Anne&#39;s call had offered a way to help her with that stress, but she was still nervous about it... about being an Animalian. But she ultimately did agree and made her way in.<br />
<br />
The walk into Horizon was quiet and Roxanne was greeted almost immediately by a Striped Skunk Animalian who came up and hugged her just as the door closed behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Roxanne,&quot; Anne said as her furry lips were pulled into a happy smile, &quot;I hope you had a safe journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anne?&quot; Roxanne said with surprise in her voice. &quot;Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, I told you on the phone I became an Animalian,&quot; Anne answered, &quot;it&#39;s how I know it will help you... help you get over all your old wounds and stresses. Let you start over in a way that would let you succeed in a way that things didn&#39;t go the first time around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you became a skunk?&quot; Roxanne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... to match with my daughter,&quot; Anne answered, &quot;she got caught in the initial outbreak... but fell in love with the one that converted her. They are happy and will soon have a family of their own.  And so her family will match their grandmother&#39;s. In the meantime... though... I am here to help a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Roxanne said slowly as Anne released her from the hug.<br />
<br />
From there, Anne escorted Roxanne through the process of filling out the paperwork that went along with the conversion process. Much of it wasn&#39;t too much, as most of the paperwork that was designed to make sure that Roxanne was aware of the Alpine Ibex&#39;s build and instincts had been filled out before her arrival. For the moment, the paperwork that was there was mostly some identification information that was pretty standard with what Roxanne might fill out with a standard doctor&#39;s visit. From there, Anne walked along with Roxanne to the modest waiting room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming along,&quot; Roxanne said slowly, &quot;It really helps. I don&#39;t think I would have gotten this far without you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem,&quot; Anne replied, &quot;though once you get to the actual conversion... that you will have to do on your own. But don&#39;t worry... everything will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roxanne gulped as Doctor Stein came to the doorway to the waiting room and called her name. Anne again assured her that she would be fine.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And from there... Doctor Stein lead me to one of their transformation rooms and I became as you see me now,&quot; Roxanne finished, &quot;I don&#39;t think you need to hear those details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose I need to...&quot; Doctor Swarzz commented, &quot;and you felt better afterward?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Roxanne nodded, &quot;it was strange... I&#39;ve long had questions and fears regarding certain things in Animalia. As to whether or not I might end up repeating the same bad experiences that hurt me in the first place. And I admit that I had them when I went in... But once I found my balance on my hooves... I actually felt a lot calmer and confident with certain things than I had going in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Swarzz nodded, &quot;that might have to do with the Animalia Virus&#39;s uncanny ability to heal injury and to a degree even with the psyche. Though the actual degree and nature of the healing can be debated with regard to the latter. As our minds aren&#39;t necessarily determined by our DNA.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I remember being chased by that rapper&#39;s friends and a part of me is still afraid of that sort of thing,&quot; Roxanne admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there is nothing wrong with being afraid,&quot; Doctor Swarzz answered, &quot;the big thing will be to address those fears and not let them control you. And know that things should be fairly bright for you. Animalia will not reject you or taunt you. And if you feel there is something you&#39;ve done wrong... Animalia has proven to be rather forgiving. Which means many of the things you&#39;ve worried on aren&#39;t likely to be major issues going forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am still a bit nervous on that though...&quot; Roxanne said slowly.<br />
<br />
Doctor Swarzz returned a calm and polite smile, which Roxanne found reassuring, &quot;and with time and effort... we work through that. Just remember that you are a strong and capable Animalian. What harmed you in the past is in the past... And I will be here to help...&quot;</p>
