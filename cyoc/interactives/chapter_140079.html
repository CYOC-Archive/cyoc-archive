<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hank the school janitor’s life was largely uneventful. “Unclog the toilets!”, “Clean up that puddle of barf!”, “Clean up that mess, dimwit!”... He was used to be bossed around like a object without feelings. As a middle aged man with a magic predisposition grade of zero, he wasn’t allowed to enter any classrooms during school hours for his own safety. During the first few months he was grateful to at least stand close to all those talented students with magical powers but that enthusiasm soon faded away. Hank had always admired magic users, but as he could only see them when they threw trash into the hallways, he began to think of them as nothing more than brats.<br />
<br />
The gruff-looking janitor was about to end his shift when he saw Professor MacGuffin heading his way.<br />
“Oh! I really wanted to see you, John...! Or was it Tom...?” He saluted and then murmured to himself. “I always have trouble remembering the names of those non-magics...”<br />
Hank pretended not to have heard that last comment. “What is it? Did a student cast a incontinence spell again and you need me to clean the mess? My shift is almost over and...”<br />
“Oh no, not at all!” MacGuffin smiled. “We ‘acquired’ a piece of school property at the last minute and it needs some... ‘fine-tuning’ before its ready for the school year. It’s there in my office. You’ll need to bring a shaving cream and a razor with you...”<br />
“A shaving razor? Is it some kind of animal?” Hank wondered. “I’m not good with those.”<br />
“Of course not! It’s just a chair. Now, if you excuse me, I’m in a hurry. I have to get the antidote for the incontinence spell...” Professor MacGuffin walked away, crossing his fidgeting legs in a peculiar way as he did.<br />
<br />
Hank didn’t understand why would a chair need a shave, but he gathered the necessary tools before walking into MacGuffin’s office.<br />
The chair by MacGuffin’s desk was made of green leather and it was in a pristine condition. The professor must have meant the pink chair standing in the middle of the room, its backrest facing the window. Hank came over to it and his nose suddenly picked up a very nasty scent.<br />
He remembered he had smelled that scent before. Yes, it smelled like his old locker room. He remembered the other boys excreting pheromones like crazy as they engaged in horseplay, their armpits, their buttocks and their crotches emitting a foul scent... Yes, this scent was exactly the same.<br />
And it was coming from this chair.<br />
<br />
Holy fuck, what sort of fatass would have sat on this chair?! Hank looked at the back side of the chair closely and could still see some dried sweat. Gross!<br />
<br />
The chair’s wooden body was a very pale shade of pink, a strange choice considering the rest of the school chairs were dark brown. It gave the chair an effeminate and naked look compared to the rest of serious and masculine school chairs. But the most peculiar thing he could see right now had to be the back of the seat.<br />
<br />
Usually, the seat of a chair is flat and square, but this one had two round protuberations. Maybe it was an ergonomic design? Hank reached out and grabbed the two round orbs. They felt strange. The texture looked like pink wood, but at the touch it was actually soft and squishy... Oh? What’s this? There’s a cavity between the two orbs and it actually is quite hairy. And the cavity goes deep... Real deep... Hank’s thick finger slided inside the warm cavity with ease...<br />
<br />
“YIIIIIIIKES!” The chair screamed in surprise. “P-put that away...!”<br />
Hank yanked out his finger in shock. His finger had now a little shitstain on it but that was the least of his worries.<br />
“Y-you... You can talk?!”<br />
To Hank’s utter amazement the chair’s legs started moving of their own and accord until the chair turned around to face him.<br />
<br />
The inanimate piece of furniture was a bizarre sight. The backrest looked like a flattened version of a young man’s face. The chair’s legs had small vestiges of what used to be fingers and toes imprinted on them. The seat was hairy with black body hair covering it and nipples and a navel were imprinted on them as well. Below the seat, a boy’s shriveled cock and balls were danling to side to side with nervousness. So that means the two big orbs Hank had been touching... And the cavity he had violated...<br />
“Argh! That’s so disgusting!” Hank screamed as he looked down at his dirty hands.<br />
<br />
The chair’s backseat deeply blushed ashamed, and then it mustered up its courage to ask. “Why... why where you forcing your finger up my asshole?!”<br />
“You’re a fucking chair! Chairs don’t have assholes! They don’t even talk!” Hank retorted.<br />
“But... I’m not... This is just a big misunderstanding! I had an accident with a spell and... Well...”<br />
The chair’s eyes darted down as he told Hank of the whole accident.<br />
“So your name’s Justin... Or Justin the chair, as everybody calls you now...”<br />
“...Actually, MacGuffin says that I have to stay like this for my whole school life! I’m not even that interested in inanimation studies...! But I will be expelled otherwise...” The chair’s eyes watered up. “Oh, dear god! I don’t want to spend my school life as school property! I don’t want to be folded up and stuck inside a closet all alone during the long summer breaks! I don’t want everybody to ignore me and treat me like an object...! I don’t want to be so exposed and defenseless!”<br />
Hank had listened to the whole story without interrupting. <br />
“If only I could have made some friends... This school was supposed to be my chance to change my life for the better... I don’t want to look like a fucking chair when they take my graduation picture... Sniff... Sniff...!”<br />
<br />
As Justin the Chair shed its tears, Hank’s mind was in conflict. Sure, the boy was going through a lot... But there was something very alluring about this whole situation. A boy had been deprived of his status as a human being, and now he stood as a naked piece of property in front of him. Everyone else firmly believed that Justin had been the one who chose this life, and the only person the chair had shared its secret with was Hank. A malicious plan had been hatching inside the muscular janitor’s mind... A plan to finally get some satisfaction from those brats and teachers who belittled him... But would he really go through with it?<br />
<br />
Justin was still sobbing. He flinched a little when he felt Hank’s huge hand rubbing the top of his backrest face. He looked at Hank’s eyes. Hank’s face was gruffy and intimidating, but Justin believed he saw a hint of compassion in the middle aged man’s eyes.<br />
“I know that you just meet me, but after hearing your story I want to support you. Please... You said you have no friends, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to make new ones... even as a chair!”<br />
“But... How are you going to help me?”<br />
“As a chair, you can’t do much on your own. I have no aptitude for magic, but I can investigate about this curse of yours.”<br />
“Really?” Justin’s face lightened up a little.<br />
“Yes, but I’ll need time. In the meantime, I need you to do something.”<br />
“Do what?” The chair asked.<br />
“I know it’ll be hard, but I’ll need you to take on the role of a chair. If we want to do this without causing a bracket and getting you expelled, it’s best if you don’t arise any suspicions about your true intentions. So, obey the teachers, let yourself be used as a chair by the other students, act like a model piece of school property.”<br />
Justin tried to put on a brave face. “Well... If it’s just for a short while, I wouldn’t have trouble pretending... I guess.”<br />
“That’s the spirit, seat boy! And remember, don’t tell anyone else about this. So don’t tell any teachers or students else about any of what you just told me, understood?”<br />
“Yes, I understand.”<br />
Hank squeezed Justin’s buttcheek and the chair yipped.<br />
“It’ll be best if we play the part even among by ourselves. That’ll serve as practice for when you have to pretend in front of everyone. So... How would a chair with no sense of self and obedient attitude had responded to that last question?”<br />
“Um... Yes, I...” Hank squeezed the cheek harder. “Yipes! Er... Understood, master.”<br />
“That’s more like it. Remember, you’re a chair. There’s no ‘I’ when you’re a chair. If you follow my rules, everybody will believe you’re a obedient little chair in no time.”<br />
“Understood. I- Oops. Your property wants to know how you’ll contact it.”<br />
“I’ll ask Professor MacGuffin permission to store you in my hut after your daily duties as a chair are over. You know, the little hut in the school grounds. That’s where I live, among all the rusty school equipment that needs maintenance.”<br />
“Hopefully your newest piece of faithful property doesn’t get rusted.” Justin shuddered at the thought.<br />
“Hahaha, of course not. I’ll make sure of it... Oh fuck, aren’t classes about to resume? I didn’t even shave your body hair off!”<br />
“I-... er... Your property looks better with hair.”<br />
“Mmmm... If anybody asks why your balls still look like a hairy mess you just make some excuse on the fly.” Hank ordered as he grabbed Justin’s testicles to take a closer look at them.<br />
“H-HEY!”<br />
“Remember, school property doesn’t feel modesty.” Hank let go of Justin’s baby makers and as the chair turned to leave he spanked his exposed buttocks.<br />
<br />
The treatment was rough, but Justin knew Hank was just doing his part to help it cope. Before leaving and marching towards the class the chair wanted to thank the janitor for becoming the first friend the chair had made in this school, but considering its new role in society, it had to make do with “Your school property is extremely lucky to have their master spank their asses all the time” as its parting words.<br />
<br />
Hank just smiled to himself. He was going to finally have some fun at this goddamn place thanks to some unlucky brat.</p>
