A bit earlier… <br />
<br />
While Claire and Arthur walked back to the apartment building Claire asked a slew of questions. He did his best to answer them, most of his knowledge limited to the aquatic weres. Which worked since Ryan hadn’t been able to answer many of Claire’s questions regarding them. <br />
<br />
“I personally haven’t met anything other than merfolk or otters around here. The lake’s freshwater, so there aren’t any of the oceanic were.” Arthur said, explaining the lack of other water-faring weres in the area. <br />
<br />
“Huh. So do you guys live in like, schools or whatever? Wolves are in packs…” Claire didn’t know the correct terms for each group of animal. <br />
<br />
“I’d better learn them,” Claire thought while Arthur gave her an answer. <br />
<br />
“Pods, only fish live in schools. It’s all very informal. I think the only weres who are really formal about that kind of stuff are the werefoxes.” he said. <br />
<br />
“Huh. Well, this is me.” Claire said, stopping at the front door. They walked up to the second floor, where the two ran into Ryan, who was carrying a bag of garbage with him. <br />
<br />
“Hey Claire. And…”<br />
<br />
“Arthur. Just helping out.” Arthur said. Ryan took Claire’s bags so she could open the door without spilling their contents. Once the doors was opened, and the guys brought the groceries inside, Claire thanked Arthur for his help. <br />
<br />
“No problem. It was nice meeting you.” he said. Arthur left, glad he took the little “detour” as it was. It was nice to get his mind off Julie and Eric, and then entire situation in general. But he was still planning on visiting her in the hospital later. Provided they let him in to see her. And, on a darker note, provided she was still in one piece. <br />
<br />
Arthur called his older brother, Derek, for a lift. He was a sophomore at the college, having chosen to stay local for school. Ten minutes later, and Arthur spotted the blue four door coming round the corner. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what’re you doing all the way over here bro?” Derek asked as Arthur climbed into the passenger’s seat. <br />
<br />
“Just helping someone with something.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, just like you to be a good samaritan. Arthur Curtis, champion for the common peoples!” Derek teased his little brother. Arthur rolled his eyes. So he liked helping people, was that such a crime? <br />
<br />
“Anyway, you want me to go in with you? Or can you be a big boy and handle the scary hospital by yourself?” <br />
<br />
“I’m not a child Derek!” Arthur protested. <br />
<br />
“You’re still my little, lovesick brother. And I want to make sure you’re well taken care of. Not always going to be around here forever. Eventually I’m moving out.” Derek chuckled. <br />
<br />
“The sooner the better.” Arthur thought. <br />
<br />
“So, do you?” Derek asked again. <br />
<br />
“I can handle it myself. I’m just going to visit Julie. It’s not like I’ve never been in a hospital before.”<br />
<br />
“No, but you’ve never gone into one to see someone this important to you in such bad condition.” <br />
<br />
Arthur wouldn’t even consider the possibility his brother was right regarding Julie’s “condition”. He’d finally managed to stop playing those terrible scenarios through his head, he didn’t want them to start again. God forbid he walk into the hospital having a panic attack. They’d definitely institutionalize him after the fact. <br />
<br />
“Fine, but you sit in the waiting room and don’t say anything to anyone! Got it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir Lieutenant Curtis.” Derek lifted a hand to salute his brother. While Arthur didn’t appreciate the theatrics, Lieutenant Curtis had a nice ring to it. Made him feel more important. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Continuing in the apartment… <br />
<br />
Once Arthur had gone, Ryan and Claire started idly chatting. At the same time, they put Claire’s groceries away. After catching up on small talk, Ryan finally addressed the golden elephant in the room. <br />
<br />
“You still haven’t made up your mind about what you’re going to do then?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“No. Should I have? Is there some sort of deadline?” <br />
<br />
“None that I’m aware of. But I imagine they’re going to want an answer before the week ends.” They being Martin Stovall and Samantha Twist. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, well at the very least, I think I’ll be staying in town. I like this place, it’s…”<br />
<br />
“Different?”<br />
<br />
“I was going to say special, but different is an appropriate adjective too.” Claire said with a smile. <br />
<br />
“If it’s not too much to ask, if you’re thinking about becoming a were, what kinds are you considering?<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I’ve ruled out a few. As interesting as Arthur made being a weremer sound, I don’t especially like the limitations, only being able to change in water and stuff. Not sure how big of a were I’d want to turn into. I mean, you and Barbara almost double in height.” <br />
<br />
“That’s not such a problem. If you’re worried about the transformations hurting, don’t be. The experience is rather exhilarating. No pain. Some minor discomfort the first time, but after it’s like riding a bike.”<br />
<br />
Claire had a different simile in mind, one that involved riding something else (wink). She stuck her head into the freezer for a second as she was putting away the pint of ice cream she bought. <br />
<br />
“I’d kind of like to see more weres. Just to get an idea what everyone looks like. I’ve only seen werewolves, the one weretiger, the little weremink, and the Twists. Can’t really go around asking people to strip and change for a complete stranger. <br />
<br />
But I’m, you know, curious. It’s like going to a zoo and spending the entire day looking at the barnyard animals. Uh, no offense.” Claire hoped Ryan wouldn’t take her babbling the wrong way, like she was comparing him to cows or pigs (two other kinds of were she wondered about on occasion).  <br />
<br />
“None taken. What does the guidebook have in the way of visual aids?” Ryan asked, never having looked at it himself. He was a born were, he got all his information from his family. <br />
<br />
“Not much. Stock photos I guess you could say.” <br />
<br />
“They REALLY need to update that book.” he said in his head. He tried to come up with some alternate way for Claire to get the information she wanted. Unfortunately the well seemed dry. <br />
<br />
“I’ll tell you what, I’ll keep an eye open in case I see something that might help. Or someone.”<br />
<br />
“Someone would really be willing to just change for a perfect stranger?” To Claire that sounded a lot like having sex with a stranger. Her mind was still running according to the normal standards of modesty. Weres weren’t that shy about showing off their bodies, though they knew when to, and when not to. <br />
<br />
“Sure. Everyone knows how stressful it is learning the secret, even the Moon Lake born and bred weres like myself. It’s tough coming into a new place, and then suddenly finding yourself in another world. Most people are pretty understanding about these kinds of things.” <br />
<br />
Claire was liking Moon Lake more and more, each passing minute. She had never met such generous or kind people before. Ryan, Barbara, even Samantha and the mayor. She’d come here for an adventure, boy did she get one.</p>
