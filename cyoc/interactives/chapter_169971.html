<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That sounds awful!&quot; Jerry says. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be forced to be with anyone you don&#39;t want to, especially with someone who you feel unsafe with!&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Rachel looking down, defeated, &quot;but what can I do about it? He&#39;s so big.&quot;<br />
&quot;I could try and sneak you away from him?&quot; Jerry suggests without really considering the risks involved.<br />
Rachel looks genuinely touched, and says &quot;Oh, that&#39;s so sweet of you. But I don&#39;t think- Shh&quot; She puts a finger to her lips, &quot;he&#39;s coming back!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex returns from the bathroom, seeming refreshed, like the events of the previous episode (or chapter) has no bearing on him. Jerry tries to act natural and steps away like he wasn&#39;t just trying to convince a monster&#39;s girlfriend to run away with him. Thankfully, Alex is distracted by the plate of food, &quot;Oh good! The grub arrived!&quot;, and picks up the plate of spaghetti and bowl of meatballs and toss both into his wide open maw, dishes and all. &quot;Hot dog, that hit the spot! ... Waiter! check please!&quot;<br />
<br />
After several minutes, Jerry returns with the bill and Alex takes it from him. &quot;This aught to cover it,&quot; Alex says before opening his mouth and unfurling his tongue to find a lime green tennis ball. He lifts it off his pallet with a squish and slides it into the card holder. &quot;Please, keep the change,&quot; he says like a big-shot. <br />
<br />
Jerry takes the card holder back utterly perplexed. He looks at Rachel for help who only gives a shrug. He turns back to Alex and says, &quot;um, right. If you could please stay for a moment, I have to run this through the back...&quot; <br />
<br />
Back in the manager&#39;s office, Jerry swings open the door and shouts, &quot;That&#39;s it! I can&#39;t handle it anymore!&quot;<br />
Tori the manager looks up from whatever she was doing, &quot;watch your tone with me, Jerry, or you&#39;ll find your ass on the street serving fast food. Now what&#39;s the problem this time?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the same customer! He scared off the other customers, I think he&#39;s forcing his date to be here with him against her will, and now he&#39;s trying to pay with... this!&quot; Jerry hands the card holder to Tori who opens it and pulls out a slobbery tennis ball which couldn&#39;t possibly have fit in there with it&#39;s shape. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fu-&quot; Tori starts, but is distracted by the copious dog slobber that drips onto her hand from the ball. She and Jerry both watch as her hand grows, first doubling and tripling in size, then paw pads inflate in, and one, two, three, four claws pop out the tips. At first Tori looks surprised and alarmed, but her eyes flutter for a second and then looks more annoyed than anything else. She opens a desk drawer and pulls out a pair of white toon gloves just like the ones Alex wares. She holds the tennis ball in her teeth (to Jerry&#39;s horror) while she puts on the four fingered gloves, which fits despite having five fingers on each hand before putting them on.<br />
<br />
The wet ball continues to do work as Tori&#39;s teeth seem to get too big for her mouth, a tangle or fangs jutting from her face, but that is quickly fixed when her lips and forming muzzle catch up in size, her nose and fat lips turning black at the end of a grey snout rivaling Alex&#39;s seemingly all-consuming maw. In fact, much of her appears to be becoming the same as Alex, including developing an inky black outline and her overall increasing size. Tori&#39;s button down shirt was struggling to contain her, and that became even more obvious when Tori&#39;s small nubs tent the front. Her teats lead the charge of her rapidly swelling breasts. They grow and grow until the shirt buttons pop with the sound of a ricochet, exposing her nipples the size and shape of soda cans standing proudly and hard in the open air atop a pair of tits bigger and as firm as medicine balls. Her ruined clothes change too, becoming a power suit, still failing to cover her stiff headlights.<br />
<br />
She experimentally pinches a fat nipple between padded gloved fingers and feels a shock of electricity course through her. She gasps and falls backwards in her chair with her feet in the air, giving Jerry a look up her business skirt while her hips widen and ass raises like bread in the oven. She starts kicking in the air in pleasure, another toe inflated, clawed, and padded with each kick until she was the proud owner of a new set of fat toon paws that could only fit in clown shoes, although thankfully her high heels appear to have kept up with her feet&#39;s growth. She finally crys out and convulses as she cums to her own nipple play as a fluffy grey tail sprouts from just above her firm pillowy butt.<br />
<br />
After a moment of wallowing in the afterglow of a good self-pleasure session, Tori snaps forward onto her feet looking down at Jerry, standing eight and a half feet tall with her new fit yet feminine toon boss wolf body, at least a foot of that height from her silly big paw pumps. &quot;Jerry! Don&#39;t you ever knock?!&quot; Jerry stands dumbfounded. &quot;Anyways...&quot; Tori inhales and spits out the tennis ball from her voluminous mouth, &quot;I don&#39;t see what the problem is, this is more than you get in tips most nights combined. In fact, such a generous customer deserves to be thanked by the owner personally,&quot; she announces and marches past Jerry towards the floor. <br />
<br />
Swinging the door open from the back hall to the customer seating area, Tori gasps in surprise. She reaches behind her, her arm stretching all the way down the hall, into her office, and grab Jerry who was still trying to come to terms with what he just saw. He&#39;s lifted off the ground and pulled right up to Tori&#39;s face, &quot;Jerry! You never mentioned that the customer was so hansom! Priorities! Get your head on strait!&quot; She drops Jerry to the floor before marching up to Alex, paying Rachel no attention. &quot;Sir! I&#39;m the owner of this restaurant and I wanted to thank you personally for dining with us this evening. Please, do come back again. When ever you like, even off hours. Or if it&#39;s closer you can go strait to my home instead,&quot; she grabs Alex&#39;s gloved hand and writes her address on it with a fountain pen. &quot;Although, if you&#39;re coming to my home you should call to let me know first. I know! We should schedule a meeting now to make it easier. How about Friday night at 7:30?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but, today is Friday&quot; Says Rachel from the side, struggling to get a word in. Just then a clock on the wall chimes 7:30. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ll be, that worked out perfectly&quot; Tori says with fake astonishment. She runs off down the hall in a flash into her office, followed by the sound of rumbling and honking and clattering before she flashes back out now dressed in a black cocktail dress. &quot;We should get going on our date- I mean meeting.&quot; She wraps her large, but comparative it Alex&#39;s dainty arm around his and practically drags him away. As he&#39;s pulled, Alex shouts back to Rachel, &quot;I had a nice evening, but I don&#39;t think we could pull off  a lasting relationship. Don&#39;t cry, there&#39;s plenty of fish in the sea. Oh! I could go for some fish right now! OK, bye!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex and Tori disappear out the front door leaving Rachel and Jerry alone in the restaurant. Rachel scurries up Jerry&#39;s apron and stand on his shoulder. Jerry turns his head towards her and says with a chuckle, &quot;so, uh, I guess you don&#39;t have to worry about your &#39;being eaten&#39; problem anymore.&quot; Then, out of nowhere, Rachel kisses Jerry on the lips. He goes wide eyed in surprise but does not fight back. It&#39;s weird at first, their size difference makes it feel more like a nibble on his lower lip, but after a tingling sensation started to set in, it felt much more natural and good. Jerry closed his eyes and let the warmth of her touch radiate through him. While he and Rachel was like this, it felt like they were the only ones in the world, and suddenly the run-in with the huge wolf costumer tonight or his boss Tori didn&#39;t bother him so much anymore. <br />
<br />
Rachel and Jerry break their kiss and look at each other at eye level. She looked so beautiful with her large round ears, cute pink nose, and rich milk chocolate fur. It complemented nicely with his own white fur. &quot;What was that for?&quot; Jerry asks in a high pitch squeaky voice, although slightly lower than Rachel&#39;s. &quot;I thought you earned a reward for being so thoughtful, and for putting up with tonight.&quot; Jerry laughs, &quot;It was nothing; you should see this place when it&#39;s busy.&quot; Rachel smiles at that, &quot;well, my plans for the night was just dragged off. Shall we follow their lead and have some fun?&quot; Jerry gives a devious look, &quot;Well, with Tori out, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll never know if I close up a little early. Come on, I know where the good cheese is kept!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two hold their tiny pink hands as they leap off the dining table and scurry to the kitchen.</p>
