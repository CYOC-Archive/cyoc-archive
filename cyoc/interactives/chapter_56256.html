<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hi Mom, Dad,&quot; Kat said with a smile as she saw her parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're in trouble now,&quot; Dani said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not in trouble for transforming you Dani,&quot; their mother said. &quot;She's in trouble for messing with Patrick's mind and transforming him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't,&quot; Kat said with a surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Patricia wanted to be a mermaid,&quot; Rick said waving his hand. &quot;You seem to have forgotten how well I know the rules Julie. Do you honestly believe I would have allowed Kat to transform Patricia if she didn't want to be transformed? If so then you are dangerously close to accusing me of complacency during the commitment of a crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie went pale and quickly said, &quot;Of course not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He sat right there and allowed Kat to transform me,&quot; Dani said waving her hand at Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should explain the rule to you,&quot; Rick said looking right at Dani which caused her to shrink back. &quot;The rule states, &quot;No witch shall transform another without due cause&quot;. I did prevent Kat from transforming you before. I had decided to give you a chance to change but you didn't take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You transformed Kat back into herself though,&quot; Dani said. &quot;You didn't have just cause for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you so sure about that?&quot; Rick asked. &quot;She did try to transform me into a bra by her own admittance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You tried to transform him?&quot; Julie asked gasping. &quot;You're lucky to still be human and not part of his collection of dolls or clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I couldn't transform him,&quot; Kat said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not surprised,&quot; Julie said. &quot;He is two thousand years old and very skilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat and Dani blurted out, &quot;Two thousand years old.&quot; Dani then continued, &quot;How is that possible? He should have been dead a long time ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was very careful not to die in any way and I transformed myself when I decided it was time to move on,&quot; Rick said with a smile. &quot;After some time I learned how to stay alive even though my body displayed all the signs of being dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you teach me that?&quot; Kat asked with a gleam in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can not be taught,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Each witch must find it on his or her own. To date only three have found this. We form the Witch's Tribunal and we are the ones that have made the laws that witches are suppose to follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like keeping being a witch a secret,&quot; Julie said with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should we keep it a secret and why can't we transform who we want?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
Rick leaned forward giving Kat a penetrating stare causing her to step back and said, &quot;It's because people fear us and will kill those that they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can transform them into something harmless though,&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have your wand you can,&quot; Rick said. &quot;You won't always have your wand and there are ways to negate a witch's power as I have demonstrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see why you're afraid,&quot; Kat said. &quot;You said that you can't die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But other witches can,&quot; Rick said. &quot;And just because I can't die doesn't mean I don't feel the pain. Try to imagine being burned at the stake. Imagine the fire slowly making it's way up your body while you're slowly being strangled as well. Imagine it taking over two hours to die. Imagine how painful that must be. Imagine the agony of knowing that the flames are consuming you and you are helpless to stop it. I can tell you that it's the worst death you can suffer having been burned at the stake myself in one of my incarnations as a gypsy woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone there flinched and shuddered at the thought of going through that. After a few moments Kat said, &quot;I don't want to go through that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then make sure you obey the laws,&quot; Rick said wagging his finger at her. &quot;Now I think I don't have to monitor you anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to go back to the UK now?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to talk with you and Henry about that,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I think it's time for me to get a new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to become one of our children?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of your daughters,&quot; Rick said with a smile. &quot;This way I can help you with Kat's witch education and with Dani and Patty's when they're old enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old will you be?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go with my usual starting age of five,&quot; Rick said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you going to die?&quot; Henry asked frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won't be anything violent,&quot; Rick said smiling. &quot;I think it'll be a heart attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry and Julie looked at each other and seemed to be having a silent conversation. After a moment they turned back to Rick and Julie said, &quot;We'd love to have you as our daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay I'm getting another sister,&quot; Patty said clapping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are Patrick,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not Patrick anymore Mommy,&quot; Patty said. &quot;I'm Patricia now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK then Patricia,&quot; Julie said. &quot;Are you sure you want to remain as a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; Patty said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to create my dead body,&quot; Rick said getting up and taking a small rock out of his pocket. Once he placed it on the chair he said a spell while pointing his wand at it and it started to change. It grew and took on a human shape. It changed color from tan to the pink of human skin. It grew hair on it's head the same color and length as Rick's. Rick's face formed on it as well as the rest of his body. It started growing a dick before replicas of Rick's clothes appeared on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks just like you,&quot; Kat said in an awed voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's suppose to,&quot; Rick said smiling. &quot;Otherwise it wouldn't convince anyone that I'm dead. Now to do myself.&quot; He said a little spell and he started to shrink. As he shrank his hair grew out a bit and the slight stubble he had retracted into his skin. Soon he looked like he was five years old. His changes didn't stop there however. His hair grew longer and became the same color as Dani and Patty's. His eyes turned the same color as their eyes as well. His face changed to resemble their faces. His dick and balls shrank until they were gone then the skin between his legs puffed up a bit and a slit appeared. His body slimmed slightly and he was now a girl. Her clothes changed so she was now wearing a baby pink tankini. She slid into the pool just as her next changes began. His tankini bottom disappeared leaving her new crotch exposed for a second before her legs fused into an ocean green tail. A film appeared over her eyes so she'd be able to see clearly underwater. Webbing grew between her fingers and thumbs that could be used to help her swim.<br />
<br />
Patty swam up to him and hugged him saying, &quot;I have another sister. I have another sister. I hope you'll be more fun than Dani. What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Mommy should decide,&quot; Rick said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think your new name will be Elizabeth, or Beth for short.&quot; Julie said. &quot;I noticed that you're not using a British accent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can't be using a British accent now that I'm your daughter,&quot; Beth said with a smile. &quot;That reminds me.&quot; She waved her wand around while saying a spell. After she smiled and said, &quot;Everyone now knows that you have four daughters Mommy. All records indicate that as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you still have your magic?&quot; Kat asked. &quot;You're younger than eighteen and girls in our family only get to be a witch when they turn eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's simple really,&quot; Beth said with a smile. &quot;Once you're a witch you stay a witch unless your powers are stripped from you. You could become five like us and you'd still have your powers. However if you transform into something that isn't able to cast spells then you'd be stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
Patty swam over to their mommy as Julie bent down.&quot; Mommy, Can I be a witch too, please?&quot; She asked with an eager face. Julia giggled at her Daughter. &quot; I suppose so, But I'll only make you 18 long enough for you to get your powers. After all I want to keep you as my little girl as long as I can.&quot; Julie smiled as she raised her wand and cast the spell. Patty grinned as she grew older. She felt a strong magic build inside of her and she loved it. It would be a part of her, now and forever. Patty giggled with excitement as she felt herself returning to her proper age. Opening her eyes, Patty beamed with joy as her mother presented her with a spell book and magic wand, Her book and her wand. Patty giggle with pride as she pulled herself out of the water and took her two new possessions and opened the page on human transformation. Patty did what the book said and she was once again human. Patty still wore her tankini top and now a bikini bottom that matched. Patty stood up and giggled happily as she dd a small twirl.</p>
