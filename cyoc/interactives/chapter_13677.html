<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mike and his hook up for the night, or at least the hour, drove along the blonde hustler couldn’t help reaching his hand over into the driver’s lap and copping a feel.  Not much to grab onto but it was getting harder with each squeeze<br />
“Careful kid.  Don’t want to crash.”<br />
“You won’t.  If you can drive to church each week with a car full of kids and your wife screaming at them…. and you… you can handle a little of this” Mike said suddenly taking a handful of the guy’s cock and squeeze in a vice like grip.  <br />
“JESUS, KID!!!  You better be on the clock already.”<br />
“Dude, I ain’t even started to earn that 150 yet.  Pull up here.  You can part in front of the Barber Shop.”<br />
As Mike got out of the passenger’s side of the car and waited on the side walk for his client to join him, he noticed the Barber Shop was still open.  <br />
“This is a great place man, you should try it out!!” Mike said walking over to the shop’s front door. “You seriously need a new do’ “<br />
“What, are you crazy kid. Don’t have time for that.”<br />
Mike walked, no, he sauntered up to the guy. His back was to Mike as he filled the parking meter with spare change so, while he didn’t see Mike, finally felt him as Mike leaned into the guy  Mikes hand reached around and grabbed the guy’s nipples though his shirt. “Come on babe.  You’re going home with a smile on your face that won’t go away for weeks.  Wifeys going to want to know why.  Nothing cheers a real man up like a hair cut.  Well, almost night…” Mike’s hand slipped down to the client’s crotch again.  He playfully started pulling down the zipper. “The Barber’s a fast worker.  I’m not…”<br />
“Ok, ok.  But the tips coming out of your price.”<br />
“ACE!!!”<br />
Mike sprang back and ran to the door, opening it gallantly for client.  As the guy passed Make was able to see him clearly for the first time.  It might have been the harsh lights of street post, or the lights in the shop’s front window, but the guy looked worn.  He might have been taller than Mike’s 6 feet plus, but he sagged at the shoulders so much it was impossible to tell.  Keeping that up might even lead to some type of back problems later in life, if not a hunch.  Skin pale from working in an office probably from dawn till way past dusk.  Ass a bit too big and a good beer belly going for him.  His reddish brown hair had a good male pattern baldness starting.  No clear bald spots yet but it was heading that way.  Certainly was thinning.  The mustache, what was that about, Mike thought.  Did not look good on him.  Had to be, yea that’s it, Mike realized, had to be his one bit of rebellion.  The Misses wouldn’t allow anything else and work would frown on a tattoo, so he went with a ‘statch.  Well, he’d leave something in that fur ball that’ll make his wife wonder what he was eating while she was away.  But what if there wasn’t a…. hmmmm.<br />
The Barber grinned and brushed a few hairs off the chair with a rag.<br />
“Mikey!!  Back so soon?  Not two hair cuts in one day Big Fella?”<br />
“No, I want you to fix my man….”<br />
“Hen….John.” Henry said introducing himself as any polite business man would.  Any businessman hanging out with a teem boy hooker who remembered he shouldn’t give his real name.  <br />
“I want you to fix my man John up like you did me this afternoon.”<br />
“My pleasure.  Well…….’John’.  What would you like?” the Barber asked pulling the sheet around ‘John’s’ neck.  Mike sat across from the guy, in a small chair along the wall.  Above his head was a mirror that ran the length of the store.  John, real name Henry, could see the Barber, Mike and himself all at the same time.  <br />
‘Kind of spur of the moment.  The Kid was pretty persuasive.  This is more his idea than mine.” He said with a nervous smile. “Just a trim.”<br />
“DUDE!” Mikey yells and leans forward, tossing aside the magazine he was trying to read.  (Nice pictures, too may words.) “LOOSE THAT LAME ASS MUSTASCHE!!!”  <br />
John/Henry was a little taken aback by this. “Well… I’ve”<br />
<br />
“I think that’s a good choice John.  Trust me, you won’t believe the change it’ll make.”<br />
That’s all he had to hear. “I think I do trust you” the man said leaning back in the chair a bit “OK, let’s do it.  As for the rest.  What ever you think is best.”<br />
Two smiles suddenly appeared in the room.  One on Mike simply because, as a simple man, he smiled a lot.  And you knew the other was on the Barber.<br />
Henry thought it was odd that the sudden sound of the small electric razor the Barber turned on didn’t make his jump.  He could smell that classic barber sent of soap, lather and shampoo as he made quick work of the mustache.  Henry could see a faint shadow left.  He did look better.  Always thought the growth made him look younger but he defiantly looked younger without it.  With one of the classic shaving cream brushes the Barber started rubbing the white foam into the left over bristles.  The aroma made Henry light headed but it felt great.  What a great idea this was. The long straight razor came out and hovered for a second over Henry before masterfully taking its first swipe.<br />
<br />
For some reason tough, the Barer didn’t wipe the foam and stubble off on a towel, but whipped it off on Henry’s chin.  Was that normal, he thought?  The rhythm started up, swipe, then wipe.  Back and forth, almost hypnotizing.  By the time he was done Henry’s upper lip was bare, but his chin was now covered with white foam peppered with brown stubble.<br />
“I’m sorry,” The Barber said, “Let me take care of that.”<br />
Softly but firmly he wipes the used shaving cream away.  It in its place is a beard.  Well kind of a beard, it’s just where the foam was, on your chin.  What do the kid’s call these?  Soul Patches.<br />
“Aces” Mike said leaning back in his chair.  His legs part and a major hard on his visible through his board shorts.<br />
“Always thought it would look good.” Henry said.  ‘I look… young.”<br />
Henry couldn’t get over it, he did look young.  And not so much as he looked when he was younger, but a younger version of someone he could have been.  He never had this firm of skin.  His cheek bones were never this pronounced.  That fat, double chin wasn’t gone but it wasn’t what it once was.  This made Henry sit up in his chair higher, shoulders back some.<br />
“Now, about that hair.” The Barber said hitting the switch on his electric razor.  The buzzing filled the room but again, the sudden harsh noise didn’t make the man in the chair jump, it got him excited.  Placing the blades on the right side of Henry’s head, the Barber took a long streak of hair off from the temple to the back of his head.  Down to barely a shadow in one sweep. Then another, and another.  With each swipe of the electric razor Henry changed.  Fat disappeared with the second stroke.  He shrank down to 5’6 with the third, but loss no mass as all that extra flesh became muscle.  Forth stroke his face squared off, chin becoming strong and firm, forehead square and eye, turning green.  <br />
When the Barber snapped off the shears there was a new man sitting in the chair.  22 year old man.  Full of life and strength.  Not as smart as before, but what he lot in book smarts he gained in street/ life experiences smarts.  The head was square but handsome, his neck almost as thick as his head, under the sheet you could see the pecs creating a rise in the fabric before is fell off in the thin waist.  The arms that were holding onto the arm rest were now thicker, hairier.  Hands rough and calloused from real work.  <br />
“Almost there” The Barber said taking out the shaving brush and starting to lather up Henry’s head.<br />
“Oh yes.” Was all Henry could get out.  <br />
Without saying a word Mike got off the chair and walked over to Henry.  Mike had cum in his pants without even touching himself.  It dribbled down his leg and left a noticeable stain in his crotch.  He got down on his knees and pushed the silky sheet up exposing Mike’s lap.  Instead of the “just came from work” outfit Henry had on when he sat down in the chair, he now wore sweat pants and well beat up sneakers.  Mike reached back farther, around Henry’s hips and pulled the pans down to Henry’s knees.  Henry had to raise up his muscular butt for a second to allow it.  Mike didn’t have to do the same with the boxer briefs Henry was originally wearing, the stained jock strap Henry had on now conveniently flipped under Henry’s nuts, allowing the 8 inch of dick to spring up.  Henry got a brief look at if in the mirror before Mike went down on it.  <br />
That wasn’t his dick!!  Maybe he hadn’t seen it in a while due to his pot belly being in the way but he certainly would have remembered a dick like that.  What the hell was going on?  Who was, what did they……  Oh my god I’ve got to get out of here?!?!  <br />
Then the straight razor touched Henry’s head and all those old thoughts stopped.  Again, like before, front to back, front to back.  And with each swipe, another change.  With the first one, his lips ballooned, cheek bones became even more pronounced, forehead a little higher and his skin a nice tan.  Second swipe, his skin starts to darken even more.  It’s becoming black.  He’s shrinking down to 5’4”.  Third swipe the hair on his body starts to fall out.  As Mike strokes Henry’s legs that hairs pull out and drop to the floor.  His legs become a bit firmer, there’s almost nothing between his skin and the built up muscle now.  Forth swipe and the head reshaped a little, becoming a bit rounder in back, forehead pulling back a bit.  The soul patch on Henry’s face is the only hair being left alone, except for is curling and kinking into a small patch of afro like hair.  His eyebrows are still there, but much thinner.  <br />
All this time Mike has been deep throating Henry’s ever changing cock.  It’s gone from a dust brown 8 inched to a deep black 11.  The head huge and purple now.  Mike notices the skin’s becoming a bit looser and as he pulls back, sees a heavy foreskin has now appeared.  The taste of the foreskin is strong, heavy, but not unpleasant.  As he continues to take the cock down his throat Mike has to move around a bit to adjust to the growing size.  <br />
Henry’s been watching Mike throughout most of this and doesn’t look up into the mirror until the Barber brings a towel to his head.  The stark whiteness of the towel all but beans off the dark blue/black skin Henry now finds himself living in.  His head reflected the bright lights of the shop off the black skin with amazing results.  There was no stubble or shadow left to mare the effect, the hair was gone and would not be coming back.  .  He’s short, 5’4” but he’s packing a big dick and ton of muscle.  The Barber removes the sheet to reveal Henry is now wearing a basketball jersey.  The straps over the shoulder do not cover the square pecs lifting off of Henry’s chest.  His nipples are big and black as coal.  Mike is still going down but they all know Henry is about done.<br />
“You’ll need one of these” The Barber said touching Henry’s ear.  As he moves his hand away a huge gold hoop earring has appeared in Henry’s ear.  It matches perfectly with the skin tone.  “Don’t there usually get sold in pairs?” the Barber asks.<br />
Henry is breathing too hard to even hear.  Suddenly, shoots his wad.  Mike plunges his head down on the shaft trying to take it all in as Henry comes in gallons like never before.  Drips of cum leak out of the corners of Mike’s mouth.  As he removes it from the still hard cock, a trail of spit and cum stretch from Mike’s mouth to the PA now adorning the end of Henry’s dick. It matches the ring in Henry’s ear. <br />
“Ah, there it is.”<br />
“Outstanding” Mike said falling back on the floor looking up at the African stud smiling like he had never smiled before. <br />
“And to you like it…. Was it John?”<br />
“No man, Kwammbe.  It’s great.  It’s exactly what I wanted.”<br />
“It always is.” The Barber said folding the sheet. “Didn’t you boys have some business upstairs?”<br />
“I don’t have 150 for you Mike, I told you that.  Not even sure I have money for this hair cut….” Kwammbe said checking for a wallet that wasn’t there. He was now speaking in a heavy accent.  “Did I leave my wallet in my car… no wait, I don’t have a driver’s license here yet.”<br />
“Are you even here legally” the Barber asked<br />
“I don’t…. I don’t think so.”<br />
“Hmmmm, tough situation.  I’ve got an idea.  Mike, why not show Kwammbe here the ropes.  Show him how you make your living.  <br />
“DUDE… BRILLIANT!!!!  Man you are going to make SO much money. Put you dick away though.” Kwammbe looked down to see his softening but huge dick still out in the open.  Her flipped it back into the jockstrap which not strained to keep it in.  He bent over to pick up his shorts, revealing two melon shaped ass cheeks encircled by white straps from the jock.  Both the Barber and Mike watched in silent appreciation.  <br />
“Let’s go up to my place first and I’ll….” Mike didn’t have to go any farther.  With smiles wiper than their faces the two young gay hustlers all but skipped out the door and into the night.<br />
The police came by a few days later asking about the mini van out front.  The owner’s wife had reported her husband missing days before and the police were wondering if the Barber saw anything.  While he had noticed the van had been there for several days, he didn’t know anything else.  <br />
“Well, that’s OK” the cop chuckled. “From the looks of it, this guy’s business partner is moving in on the wife even before her missing husband’s bed is cold.  Maybe he caught on and left town out of shame.”  <br />
“Could be.”<br />
“From the looks of him he didn’t seem the type that would take life very easily.  Up tight, out of shape, stuck in a rut.  Not like those two.” the policeman said gesturing to the tall blonde surfer dude carrying his smaller dark black buddy piggy back down the street. “Say what you will, those gay boys certainly know how to enjoy life.”<br />
“They’re both regular customers of mine.  They’ve promised to bring some of their friends.  How about you Officer?  I offer a very special deal to law enforcement clients….</p>
