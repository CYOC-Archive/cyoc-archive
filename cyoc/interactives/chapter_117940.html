<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fluttering behind his lover, Jay and Jane came to rest in a valley park just inside the city. The quiet hilly place had a burbling stream, walking trails, and a vast line of trees leading to what were ski trails in the winter.<br />
<br />
Jay looked around at their surroundings and was startled as Jane put her wing around him assertively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember when you first saw me?&quot; She said sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course!&quot; Jay said.<br />
<br />
They cuddled in the long grass around them and watched the water lazily twist under a stone bridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were...&quot; Jay&#39;s eyes widened and he stared at his girlfriend in sudden realization. &quot;You were making a nest. Jane! D-Did you have a partner already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wasn&#39;t you.&quot; She said simply. &quot;Nor could he ever be. There&#39;s a point I&#39;d like to make in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which... is?&quot; Jay in sudden uncertainty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, through sheer will, ascended me from a mere animal. I am no longer of instinct and compulsion but of thinking and feeling. I&#39;ve left that part of me behind just as you want to leave your human life behind. We are both, in a sense, reborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay took in her words thoughtfully and mulled over them, eventually smiling. &quot;You&#39;re so poetical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With the mind and consciousness that you granted me, my handsome Jay, through a good natured act of kindness.&quot; Jane took a deep breath. &quot;I was ready to be mated as I used to be. I would like to be mated as I am now, and I want to share my life with yours. No matter what we are or where we go, we will always have been destined for each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warm tears began to surge forward in Jay&#39;s avian eyes. Jane saw the expression of pure emotion and gently craned her head to his chest reassuringly. &quot;Is that joy or sorrow? I must know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody has ever cared for me like this.&quot; Jay said simply. &quot;I&#39;ve never cared for anything like I care for you. Are... you saying that we were meant to be here? That I was meant to change you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had your pick of anything to change and you settled on me.&quot; Jane said sweetly. &quot;I do believe that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay sat silently, wiping his eyes with one wing. Jane put her wing on top of his, looking deep in his eyes. &quot;I would like to teach you now.&quot; She said softly, her intentions clear. &quot;Will you follow me?&quot;<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The tallest tree on the highest hill in the park was completely inaccessible to any other animal but a bird with wings. Sitting comfortably in each other&#39;s embrace on a soft bed of leaves and bark they had put together, some three stories above the ground, the two birds began to act on their lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to show you how we work, at least, as we are.&quot; Jane said with a sly smile. Standing with each other, the female blue jay gently bent down and raised her tail feathers in the air. Jay stared at his girlfriend&#39;s pussy, swollen and warm. Inviting. A pert protrusion of pink just ahead of her beautiful blue tail, just at the edge of her body. Strangely alien from what he had imagined it to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my cloaca.&quot; She said scientifically. &quot;You have one too. It is both a sex organ and a means of evacuating waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay&#39;s eyes widened. A mood killing record scratch would have been appropriate. &quot;Y-You mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a very efficient organ.&quot; She continued, seeing his total disbelief and apparent disgust. &quot;To do the deed, we would need to rub our cloacas together to completion, whereupon you will fertilize me by ejaculating semen and then I will lay eggs. The entire process will take very little time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing Jay&#39;s crestfallen expression, Jane now trilled again. &quot;I can see your disapointment. Do humans do it differently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have had a penis.&quot; Jay explained. Seeing her quizzical face, he elaborated nervously. &quot;Uh, a shaft to insert into your hole. And...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh.&quot; She nodded. &quot;I see, I see. Is it like... dogs? I&#39;ve seen dogs mating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of.&quot; Jay said, shrugging a little. &quot;Anatomically, the point is the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That does seem more... personal.&quot; She said, smiling. &quot;Having my lover place a part of his body inside of me. I wonder how that would feel!&quot; She drifted off, trying hard to comprehend such love making.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do... you still... want to go... more human?&quot; Jay said, wondering if he had hurt his lover&#39;s feelings by showing disgust at her natural intercourse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a moment.&quot; Jane said wickedly. &quot;I want to try something first. I want to please you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gulping, Jay stood stiffly as Jane walked in front of him, brushing her warm feathered body across his own, and soon enough he relaxed as she caressed him and preened him, soon growing aroused once again. He realized what was about to happen as, with her human intelligence, she reached under his tail with her wing and began softly rubbing his bulge.<br />
<br />
The feeling of her smooth feathers on his apparent cloaca sent Jay into a stupor. He felt sexual pleasure for the first time in his avian body... and it felt incredible. Jane continued rubbing in a soft circular pattern, tracing the contour of his bulge, and Jay lowered his head and closed his eyes. His first sexual experience with another was with his beautiful blue jay lover.<br />
<br />
Slowly he felt building. Swelling. An urgent need growing within him. That was a familiar sensation he knew well. Almost without thinking, he began to grind his opening against her wing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my goodness.&quot; Jane said in whispy delight. &quot;This is incredible! Look at you, my handsome Jay. Imagine me behind you, my own organ rubbing on yours. Do you understand now? There&#39;s nothing offensive about this. This is how you get pleasure now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The suggestion of grinding this strange new sex organ on Jane&#39;s own made Jay almost buckle with need to do so. Her wing began to press harder and circle his orface faster. He felt building... building... he went low to the ground and raised his tail feathers into the air, shaking! The pressure! He was going to cum!<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, my mate.&quot; Jane said, coyly slipping her wing out from under him and licking a drop of clear fluid from her feathers.<br />
<br />
Jay turned in anticipation and sure enough Jane&#39;s foot stepped on his back. The position was totally alien to him, but he had a good inclination of what she was about to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish me to be infertile.&quot; She said with a grin. &quot;Can you?! I don&#39;t want to be a mother yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, concentrated, and Jane jerked as a sharp pulling rendered her unable to brood. &quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; She said in excitement, and continued. Standing on Jay&#39;s back, almost straddling him, she pressed her tail under him and began to grind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me teach you how to do this.&quot; She said, already panting, and Ty realized their cloacas were touching. He felt her warmth and apparent wetness. He felt her flesh grinding on his. Again, the pressure.<br />
<br />
Jane began to grind harder, harder, and Jay prayed he could last for her. As it turned out, he easily held on for his mate. She let out a terrific song of pure ecstasy, crying from the tree top as she went into orgasm. This display pushed Jay right over, and with a sudden internal pulsation he released his seed, splattering Jane&#39;s cloaca with his sperm as they pressed together in rapture.<br />
<br />
Orgasm faded quickly, leaving both heavily breathing and satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lesson&#39;s over.&quot; Jane said with a trill. &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn to teach me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... a very eager student.&quot; Jay said in a daze, and together they embraced and laughed.</p>
