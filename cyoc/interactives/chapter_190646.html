<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dillon had a brilliant idea to prove to Jacob the ring works. “What if I told you… you can be as big and strong as me?” Dillon said flexing his muscles out. Jacob’s tail twitched as if his spine just shivered as his eyes looked like they were gonna pop. Dillon knew he had him caught because he always wanted to build muscles but never had the time. Dillon held the ring close to his mouth. “Jacob will grow muscles as big as mine with a sense of enjoyment.” Dillon said. Jacob looked confused as to why Dillon was talking to a ring. “Whatever man. As much as I’d like it, there’s… no… way…” Jacob started to stutter as he saw the ring glow himself. “Now, bulk up!” Dillon shouted. <br />
<br />
Not even a second after, Jacob could feel the sensations in his body. He could already see his chest and shoulders getting bigger. His average build chest started to balloon into pecs as large as Dillon’s. “No way,,, this is unreal…” Jacob said struggling but enjoying the rush of having his body grow. His shoulders and arms started to bulk up as his t-shirt started to rip. “Oh, sorry. I should’ve modified your clothes too.” Dillon said scratching the back of his neck. Jacob couldn’t register what Dillon said as he was too focused at his hands getting bigger and his stomach hardening into six pack abs. “Yess… I feel… big… strong… GAH!” He bent to his knees and shirked as his shirt gave out and ripped clean off.<br />
<br />
Jacob’s upper body continued to grow as the changes moved down to his lower body. Jacob physically felt his crotch bulging and his glutes tightened below his slim monkey tail that was growing slightly longer and swishing erratically. His knees started to shred his jeans as his calves grew muscular with visible veins. His feet started hurting as his shoes were getting to tight. “Ugh!” Jacob fell to his chin on the floor as his shoes practically ripped in half revealing his supersize feet ending his growth. Jacob lied on the ground panting in exhaustion/excitement that just flowed through his body.<br />
<br />
Jacob looked up to see Dillon holding out a muscular arm. “C’mon, let’s see those results.” Dillon said as Jacob grabbed his hand and lifted himself with the help. Dillon looked at Jacob pleased with the results. He was basically just as ripped as he was, “Almost like looking in a mirror.” Dillon joked while Jacob was still trying to catch his breath. “Believe me now?” Dillon said with a smug smile. Jacob just looked at him then at his new muscular body. It was true their bodies almost looked identical if it weren’t for Jacob’s more tan skin tone. They basically had builds of giant gorillas. “Holy shit, that felt amazing…” The two stared at each other for a minute before Jacob came closer and held his pectoral muscles against Dillons. The next few minutes, the two were based flexing off against each other holding their biceps side by side. “I mean, your not wrong. It’s we’re basically even.” Jacob said backing up to give them space. “Yeah, but I think my tails give me more muscle overall.” Dillon laughed. “Nah, that’s more fat than muscle. At least I got a flexible one.” Jacob swished his tail around. “Flexible, huh?” Dillon said curling his chameleon tail.<br />
<br />
The two continued to joking around and admiring their muscular bodies before Jacob finally admitted his disbelief. “So that ring can really do anything you tell it?” He asked. “It worked with everything so far. You know my landlord Phil?” Jacob nodded at Dillon. “The kangaroo mother man right?” Dillon laughed at Jacob’s name for Phil. “Yeah. Before he was just a normal guy. But I gave him a female kangaroo body with his own joey.” Jacob saw the implication and realized how ridiculous that really sounded. “So he wasn’t a kangaroo before?” Jacob asked chuckling a bit. “Nope. No roo or child. Not until now at least.” Dillon sat back down on the couch. “So, does this basically mean me, and everyone else is at your whim? I mean, you could just change anything and people live with it like it’s nothing.” Dillon felt weird with Jacob’s comment. He certainly enjoyed the time he had with the ring, and he was right that every change he made people could just live with it, but him manipulating minds like that kinda gave him an unnerving feeling. He could have done what he did with Jacob and he wouldn’t even react if it wasn’t for his specific command. “Yeah… I guess you could put it that way.” Dillon said with a sense of guilt. “Hey man, I say go nuts! The world is basically your sandbox. I get your not comfortable with changing how people think, but your still in control. I was just lucky enough you wanted me to witness this. Cause I know I wouldn’t turn down a cool power like that.” Jacob explained. This made Dillon feel a bit better about the whole situation. “Yeah… I guess I shouldn’t question it. I should just roll with it… you were surprisingly going real philosophical with me right there.” Dillon commented. Jacob laughed. “Yeah. I have those moments.”<br />
<br />
Dillon and Jacob stared at the ring in question. “So, what do you plan to do next Mr. all powerful Dillon?” Jacob teased Dillon. “Yeah… good question.” Dillon thought.</p>
