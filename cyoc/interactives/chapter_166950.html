<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Anna’s clothing put away Mark went to find Anna. As a councillor Mark had been told he needed to visit the Administration office after 4.30, hopefully the real Anna would accompany her. Mark knocked on the door to Anna’s room.<br />
<br />
The door opened but it wasn’t Anna. It was the Asian girl Mark had noticed “Jennifer” talking to earlier. <br />
<br />
Before Mark could ask for “Jennifer” she was grabbed by the Asian girl and pulled inside, with the door pulled shut behind her. The girl snipped the lock on the handles. <br />
<br />
‘What the?’ said Mark.<br />
<br />
‘I’ve been so looking forward to seeing you again. We had better hurry as my room-mates will be back soon’ with that the girl wrapped her arms around Mark and drew their bodies together. Mark was conscious of her breasts pushing into the girls as the girl gave Mark a passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
Eventually the kiss ended. Not by Mark. She was enjoying it. Just who was this girl? ‘Anna, it’s so good to see you again. I was disappointed to see we weren’t going to share a room. Maybe one of us could change’<br />
<br />
‘Umm yeah…. It’s good to see you too’ Mark didn’t know what to say. ‘I actually didn’t know you were in this room. I was looking for my friend Jennifer’<br />
<br />
‘Jennifer? That’s her bed. She and Kate have gone to the admin building to collect their schedules. She’s a looker isn’t she? How do you know her?’<br />
<br />
‘She goes to my school. I convinced her to sign up to be a counsellor’ well that was sort of half the truth. It was Anna who had convinced Mark to sign up as “Jennifer” <br />
<br />
‘I was sitting beside her on the bus. She seems really nice. I think we can be good friends? Does she know about us? Do you think she will mind?’<br />
<br />
Mark didn’t know for sure what the Asian girl meant by “Us” however she suspected from the greeting that perhaps Anna and the Asian girl were some sort of lesbian couple. Mark could recall Anna saying “It wouldn’t be the first time I fooled around on camp”. Now she guessed who with. Mark needed to find Anna and talk to her urgently. ‘I need to go and get my own schedule. I was going to take Jennifer up there thinking she wouldn’t know where to go’<br />
<br />
‘Kate took her. She’s in the third bed’ <br />
<br />
‘Oh right’ Mark had no idea who Kate was. ‘I’d better go, I have a few other jobs to do. We can talk later’ <br />
<br />
‘Sure. I heard you’re now leading girl. I hope that doesn’t mean you can’t spend time with your old friends’<br />
<br />
‘I hope not as well. That’s what I have to find out’. With that Mark pulled away and quickly exited the room. She had to find out the name of that girl. It wasn’t that Mark didn’t enjoy the kiss. Being kissed like that at any time was a turn on however she felt very confused. Was she somehow cheating on Anna? Or was she awkward at the idea of Anna making love to another girl? She hurried up to what looked like the office of the camp.<br />
<br />
In the building there were a number of girls sitting down and apparently waiting. They were chatting away and no doubt renewing old acquaintances. Mark new the camp wasn’t just for the girls who had come up on the two buses this morning. She had seen at least 1 more bus pull up since she had arrived and guessed there may have been one or two earlier buses. None of the girls in the room looked familiar, certainly Jennifer was not in sight.<br />
<br />
One of the girls called out ‘Anna, how are you?’<br />
<br />
Thank god this girl was wearing a name tag. “Kylie” was a short dark haired girl who looked to be about 17, Anna’s age. <br />
<br />
‘Hi Kylie. What’s the story? What are we meant to do?’<br />
<br />
‘Join the queue. Don’t worry it’s not that long. There’s only Sharon and Jessica in front of me. Amy and Rhonda are with me. Your friend Kate is in there now with a new girl’<br />
<br />
‘A tall blonde called Jennifer?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes. Do you know her? She seems nice’<br />
<br />
‘Yes we go to school together’<br />
<br />
‘So you should join us and tell us what you have been up to for the last year’ <br />
<br />
Awkwardly Mark sat down on the seat Kylie indicated. The conversation wasn’t that bad. It seemed that Kylie was “Leading Girl” from the buses that had arrived earlier in the day and that Sharon was “Leading Girl” for the last bus to arrive. Mark just wished she knew what “Leading girl” involved. <br />
<br />
Kylie and the others just wanted to know how many girls “Anna” was looking after and a bit of gossip about “Jennifer”. Mark was able to fill them in on Jennifer, just giving them details of the real Jennifer. Yes she was a cheerleader and yes all the boys at school did lust after her. That got the conversation around to boyfriends. <br />
<br />
‘Did you end up hooking up with one of the guys you were telling us about last year?’ asked the girl Mark now knew was Rhonda. <br />
<br />
Awkwardly Mark asked ‘I can’t remember what I told you. But yes I now have a boyfriend. His name is Mark’<br />
<br />
‘So is Mark the good looking rich boy your parents liked or the nice nerd? I can remember you couldn’t decide which one you would go out with’<br />
<br />
Mark could feel herself blushing. No doubt Mark in his own body was the nice nerd. The rich boy was James, his rival. James had the advantage of being the son of Mr K’s boss. Anna had gone out with James on more than 1 occasion prior to accepting a date with Mark. As far as Mark knew James was in the past. Mark thought James was totally up himself.<br />
<br />
‘Mark is the nerd but he’s very good looking’. That was probably an exaggeration but vanity made her say that.<br />
<br />
Just then an inner door opened and “Jennifer” and the girl who must be Kate came out. “Jennifer” was carrying a folder. She saw Mark and came across. <br />
<br />
‘Hi Anna. Just finding out what I signed up for. It sounds like I’ll be busy in the mornings but will have free time every afternoon’<br />
<br />
A woman came out and summoned Sharon and Jessica went into the office. While there she said ‘Hi Anna. It’s good to see you again. We won’t be long.’ Clearly like everyone else, she knew Anna.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer” took a seat beside Mark. But Kate (again after greeting “Anna” with a hug – but no passionate kiss) made excuses and headed back to the dormitory. <br />
<br />
It was Kylie who asked ‘Jen, can you tell us anything about Anna’s boyfriend. All we know is that his name is Mark’<br />
<br />
‘Mark, yes I know Mark. He’s nice’<br />
<br />
‘Come on tell us more. What’s he like?’<br />
<br />
‘Well he’s tall and he’s smart. Though he has been known to do some dumb things’<br />
<br />
‘Is he good looking?’<br />
<br />
‘Well I’d have to say he is very pretty for a boy. I wouldn’t say he’s the most masculine boy around’ <br />
<br />
Mark wearing Anna’s body could feel herself turning beetroot red. No doubt at the moment she wasn’t very masculine. Then a thought hit her. ‘I’ll show you a picture’ She got out her phone and found a picture of herself and Anna at the end of school dance. There was Anna in the red dress Mark had just hung up in her wardrobe. Mark was in a suit and tie at Anna’s side. In Marks opinionion the boy in the photo was masculine. The girls gooed and gushed.<br />
<br />
‘He is pretty’ said Amy. Mark was not used to be called pretty. She was silent, lost for words.<br />
<br />
‘What about you Jennifer? You must have your pick of boys at school. Do you have a boyfriend?’<br />
<br />
‘No if I had my pick of boys Mark would be my boyfriend.’ She gave Mark a wink. ‘Alas I’m single. I guess an all-girl camp isn’t the greatest place to find boys’<br />
<br />
‘Don’t worry. As senior girls we have dances with the boys’ camp every Saturday night. With your looks you will be able to have your choice. Usually some of the activity co-ordinators are pretty hot as well. Last year there was this Kiwi bloke who gave archery lessons, he was to die for’<br />
<br />
‘Oh really, luckily I put archery down as one of my electives. Tell me more about this boys’ camp. Anna didn’t tell me anything about it’<br />
<br />
Kylie went on to explain that there was a boys’ camp on the other side of the lake. It was run by the same foundation. <br />
<br />
She was still telling “Jennifer” about this when the door opened. Kylie, Amy and Rhonda were called in to the office.<br />
<br />
Alone at last Mark was able to talk to Anna. In hushed tones she said ‘You didn’t tell me about the boys’ camp. I could have gone there. It would have been easier than this’ she indicated herself.<br />
<br />
‘We only see the boys once per week. I need to see more of you than that’<br />
<br />
‘Well we need to swap. I can’t be leading girl. I don’t know what a leading girl does’<br />
<br />
‘It’s easy. You will have free afternoons as well. We can spend our afternoons together’<br />
<br />
‘So what do I have to do?’<br />
<br />
‘Look after your charges. I and Kate are in charge of the 14 to 16 year olds&#39;. You are in charge of the 10 – 13 year olds&#39;. You just have to get them to breakfast and ready for each of the morning activities. Once they have had lunch they will be off to their elective activities and they are someone else’s problem until after dinner. Like I say we can spend every afternoon together’<br />
<br />
‘Do I get any help? I don’t know how to look after 10 year old girls. One of them spewed all over me on the bus’<br />
<br />
‘So that’s why you are no longer wearing my blue dress. I thought you must have just got shy, not wanting to look too pretty. But to answer your question. Heather will be in charge. You just have to help her’<br />
<br />
‘That reminds me. You probably need to get your dress cleaned. It stinks’<br />
<br />
‘It’s your dress now “Anna”. Take it to the laundry. It might need to be soaked. All your clothes have your name on them. I’ll need to mark all of Christine’s clothes that I borrowed. I should get a marker while I’m here in the office’<br />
<br />
‘You will need to help me. I have no idea how to care for your dress. By the way. I went to your room earlier and met an Asian girl. She greeted me in a way I wasn’t expecting. I gather she is the girl you have “Experimented” with’<br />
<br />
It was Jennifer’s turn to blush. ‘Yes, we have been special friends. She’s quite a kisser’<br />
<br />
‘I was expecting to be kissing you. Not your girlfriend’<br />
<br />
‘Did you enjoy it? I mean I can imagine how Abby might have greeted you’<br />
<br />
‘Abby? Of course I did. I’m a 17 year old male. I…. Well I was a 17 year old male’<br />
<br />
‘Maybe you wouldn’t need to break up with Abby. I wouldn’t mind. Maybe we could be a threesome?’<br />
<br />
Mark couldn’t believe what Anna was saying. She had visions of being in bed with two lingerie clad females. The idea was appealing. She felt herself getting moist. ‘Umm…. Maybe’<br />
<br />
‘Let’s tread carefully though. Try and avoid Abby tonight. Our affair last summer was a secret. Kate is pretty straight laced she mustn’t find out’<br />
<br />
Just then the inner door opened. Kylie, Rhonda and Amy came out. Kylie told Mark ‘Mrs Berken told me to send you in Anna’</p>
