<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karyn and I were equally excited and nervous about the transformations class.  We supposedly had a vial that <br />
could transform a human into a horse.  Based upon what my mother told us, we might have to demonstrate its <br />
effectiveness.  That was assuming we’d made it right in the first place.<br />
<br />
The class was held in a normal looking science lab, but with one significant difference.  One of the walls <br />
could open to reveal a large fenced area outside.  It was being closed as we entered the class.  Before we <br />
could sit down we were confronted by a friendly looking woman with long black hair who appeared to be in her <br />
late 30s.  “Karyn and Joey, how are you today?” she asked eagerly.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” we answered simultaneously.<br />
<br />
“Good to hear,” said the woman.  “Are you two interested in volunteering your project today?”<br />
<br />
I was too afraid to answer.  I looked at Karyn.  She glanced at me briefly but said, “Sure, why not?”<br />
<br />
“Wonderful.  Why don’t you give me your formula now so I can get it ready,” said the woman.  Obviously she was <br />
our teacher, but I was clueless as to her name.  Karyn retrieved the formula from her purse and handed it to <br />
the teacher.  “Don’t worry,” she said.  “I have full confidence and you two, and you know we don’t take <br />
risks.”  She walked to what seemed to be her own personal lab table and began to prepare our formula for <br />
testing, I assumed.<br />
<br />
Karyn and I took our seats.  “What’s her name?” Karyn whispered to me.<br />
<br />
“Get ready,” I said.  I made the wish to know the names of both this teacher and our sex class teacher.  We <br />
got hit by the jolt again, but since we were both getting used to it by now, it didn’t have as much impact.  <br />
“Lori Youngblood.  Professor Youngblood, I guess,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Our sex teacher is named Chelsea Chester?” Karyn asked.  “That sounds like a porn name.”<br />
<br />
I looked at her suspiciously.  “And you would know how?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shut up,” she said as she slapped me in the arm.<br />
<br />
The class began with Prof. Youngblood addressing the class.  She said, “So far in our studies we have <br />
witnessed the transformation to a stag and to a bull.  Today we are going to continue with a stallion.  Joey <br />
and Karyn have very generously volunteered their formula for examination and, if all goes well, <br />
transformation.  So let’s get right to it.”<br />
<br />
She turned on a projector which showed an image of our formula under a microscope.  She pointed out several <br />
characteristics to the class, using a bunch of scientific terms that were strangely familiar to me.  Part of <br />
me said I shouldn’t have had a clue as to what the professor said, but somehow I knew exactly what she meant.<br />
<br />
After Prof. Youngblood pointed out the characteristics of our formula, she removed it from the microscope and <br />
put up a different slide.  The second slide contained what she said was a scientifically approved formula for <br />
human to horse transformations.  She pointed out a few differences between ours and this one, mostly little <br />
things that were results of the different conditions under which the formulas were created.  She declared that <br />
our formula was correct and could be used for demonstrations.  <br />
<br />
Prof. Youngblood returned to the front lab table and turned off the projector.  She had a syringe with which <br />
she loaded our formula.  She looked at us and said, “Which one of you wants to show us your success?”<br />
<br />
Karyn stood right up and said, “I will.”<br />
<br />
I stood up beside her and said, with a worried look on my face, “Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
“Positive,” she said with a grin.  Then she whispered, “If anything goes wrong, you’ve got the ring to make it <br />
right.”<br />
<br />
“Sharing secrets are we?” Prof. Youngblood asked.<br />
<br />
Karyn walked to the front of the class.  “Oh, I just told her to stop being such a wuss,” she replied.  This <br />
drew laughter from everyone in the class.<br />
<br />
“Joey, this is your formula, too, so please give your partner support,” Prof. Youngblood said as she motioned <br />
for me to come to the front of the class.  “Let’s get ready,” she said.  She pressed a button on something <br />
that looked like a remote control and the wall in the classroom opened.  “Ready Karyn?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Karyn took a deep breath.  “Ready,” she said bravely.<br />
<br />
Prof. Youngblood inserted the needle into Karyn’s arm and injected the formula.  The effects took place rather <br />
quickly.  A fine layer of gray fur began to appear in several places on Karyn’s body.  It grew thicker and <br />
soon covered her entire body.  A tail sprouted above her ass and grew in length.  The professor asked her to <br />
demonstrate her control of it and Karyn swished the tail back and forth.<br />
<br />
The professor gave a kind of play by play account of Karyn’s transformation as it took place.  The next change <br />
was that Karyn’s pussy sealed.  Once that happened her magnificent breasts receded into her body.  Professor <br />
Youngblood reminded us that all of our formulas, for this part of the class, were only for the male form of <br />
our “less fortunate” species.  She hinted that evolution had not been as kind to other animals as it had been <br />
to us.  Karyn looked worried at the loss of her breasts but the professor reassured her nothing was wrong.<br />
<br />
More dramatic changes began now.  Karyn’s cock changed in shape to resemble that of a horse.  It also grew to <br />
an incredible size that could almost touch her chest.  Karyn could not help but let out a few moans as her <br />
cock changed.  Next Karyn’s ears changed as they grew more pointed and less rounded as compared to human ears.  <br />
They also increased in size.<br />
<br />
The next change happened in Karyn’s feet.  Her toes became covered in a black, enamel-like substance as they <br />
slowly fused together and became hooves.  Her fingers followed suit and they too fused together to become <br />
front hooves.  Her arms started to resemble the forelegs of a horse.  Her body began to thicken and add muscle <br />
in several areas, most noticeably in her ass.  <br />
<br />
Prof. Youngblood cautioned that the next part might cause some discomfort.  Karyn’s body added muscle in the <br />
upper parts of her body, while she was gradually forced into a four-legged position.  I could see was in pain <br />
as she gritted her teeth.  Her body increased in overall size and she now looked completely like a horse <br />
except for her face.<br />
<br />
Her hair grew longer so that it resembled the mane of a horse.  The last and most dramatic part of her change <br />
started as her teeth grew larger and her face pushed out into a horse’s snout.  She let out a few soft cries <br />
of pain and by doing so made clear the change in her voice from human to horse.  What started as “Aah’s” <br />
became “Neigh’s.”<br />
<br />
I was truly amazed.  Where Karyn once stood there was now a powerful and graceful looking stallion.  Prof. <br />
Youngblood beckoned for Karyn to follow her to the outside area.  Karyn complied with no difficulty.  The <br />
professor asked her to run in the enclosed area.  Karyn appeared wobbly at first but soon gained control of <br />
herself and galloped throughout the small field.  She let out several cries which I interpreted to be happy in <br />
nature.<br />
<br />
After ten minutes of running around, Karyn returned to us.  The professor asked Karyn if she was ready to <br />
change back.  Karyn appeared to shake her head “No,” but the professor insisted since the class was about to <br />
end.  She injected Karyn with what she said was an antidote to our formula.  Within a few minutes Karyn was <br />
again herself.  The professor dismissed the class but asked the two of us to remain.</p>
