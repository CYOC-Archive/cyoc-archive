<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Buh, bye, monkeyboy,&quot; said Karl as he tapped his tablet.<br />
<br />
Chad sat in the now huge chalk circle.  This couldn&#39;t be real.  Karl must&#39;ve slipped him LSD or something. Karl looked huge.  He really felt he was a tiny monkey, and he had climbed and crawled on Karl.  Damn, it felt so real.  What did Karl say about soccer?  It reminded him of something Coach Sinclair used to say, &quot;Be the ball.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad wasn&#39;t a monkey any more.  Damn, it was hard for him to think now.  Definitely drugs of some type.  Maybe that stuff his secret admirer said to wear.  He no longer had Bonzo&#39;s thoughts and memories overwriting his own.  His mind was like a blank slate. He was a sphere.  No hands, no feet, no tail.  He was the ball! <br />
<br />
Karl strolled over to the soccer ball sitting on the field house floor, and kicked the ball up, and dribbled it between his feet. He laughed, &quot;Feels good to kick you around for a change, ballboy. Chad how does it feel to be demoted from Quarterback, Water Polo Center and Baseball Pitcher to ballboy?  Well, I better get you back to the Athletic Building, so you&#39;re ready for Real Football Practice tomorrow morning.  Remember what Coach Sinclair says to all his ball players?  &quot;Be the ball&quot;, and now you really are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kicking the shiny new soccer ball all the way from the field house, and through the open door and into the athletic building, and into the locker room.  It was mostly deserted at this time.  Most of the athletes would be using the locker room in about an hour or two, as after school practices and workouts came to an end.  He kicked the ball down one row, and then the next.  He kicked the ball into the football team&#39;s locker room, saying, &quot;Ooops!&quot; In case, anyone heard.   Karl followed Chad the ball into the football locker room.<br />
<br />
All the football players were out on the practice field except for Chad.  He kicked Chad the ball up and bounced him off of Chad&#39;s locker then rebounded Chad on his knees bouncing Chad back and forth.  Chad was rolling back and forth from one knee to the other while Karl&#39;s penis quickly rose to tent his shorts.  Fuck, Karl was getting off on Chad&#39;s helpless soccer ball state.  Oh, fuck, he was going to get kicked to hell by Karl and the soccer team tomorrow.  Damn, he missed having a penis.  Wait, he could still sense his penis- it was his air valve now. Oh, great, if those guys knew, Karl and Willem, and Todd and the rest would all aim for the valve when they kicked him.  He was so focused on himself and Karl&#39;s tented shorts, he hadn&#39;t realized that Karl had opened Chad&#39;s locker, and spread his gear on the locker room bench.  Only when Karl decided to search through Chad&#39;s gym and clothes, and set the soccer ball down on the floor did Chad realize that Karl was looting his locker.  It suddenly occurred to Chad that Karl&#39;s prank might not be a prank.  He had assumed he&#39;d be transformed back into a man after soccer practice ended tomorrow, but now?  Karl was emptying Chad&#39;s wallet.  Karl held up the three unopened condom packets, and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think you will ever be needing these again, ball boy,&quot;  Karl laughed. Then he pulled out Chad&#39;s fake ID&#39;s, &quot;Oh, wow, I mean, wow. You have all these fake ID&#39;s.  Very realistic.  I&#39;ll have to ask your replacement what you used them for, after I upload your memories into him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Replacement?  wondered Chad.  <br />
<br />
Karl wheeled in the dirty towel bin, and then the lost and found bin.  He emptied out the damp towels and the discarded jockstraps, torn shorts, holey underwear, and smelly socks into a heap on the locker room floor. Then he put on a hazmat glove, and opened a metal thermos, and poured a shiny metallic liquid onto the pile of fabric.  He hit a button on his tablet.  The mass of cloth became a shiny black molten liquid that rose into a humanoid shape.  A phallic shape rose out of the black statue.  It looked only vaguely like Chad, but Chad felt weird.  He was tingling all over.  The nanobots in him were syncing with the nanobots in the towels and clothes.  Suddenly, the shimmering black statue was naked Chad.  Then Chad&#39;s life began to flash before his eyes at a ridiculously high speed.  The nanobots were copying his memories and transmitting them to the Chad clone or was it a robot?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Carl, what the fuck are you doing with my stuff?&quot; the new Chad asked angrily.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say, nanoChad?&quot; Karl said in a mean tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry Master Karl, sir.  I guess, my programming was still uploading when I spoke.  May I give you a blow job to make amends, sir?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
No fucking way, thought Chad.  Oh, gawd.  He was going to be a soccer ball forever!<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, Chad.  First,&quot; Karl said, &quot;I gotta inventory this new soccer ball.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet, Master Karl, may I watch as you mark the former me as official school property?&quot; the doppelganger said eagerly.<br />
<br />
Ballboy was horrified to see his naked doppelganger popping a raging hardon at the prospect of the real Chad being reduced to athletic equipment.  <br />
<br />
Karl laughed, &quot;Sure.  I guess, his new purpose in life signifies your new life too.  Sort of like a christening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Christening?  Yeah.  Can I go out for soccer team, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would Chad go out for soccer?&quot; Karl said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ball boy wouldn&#39;t unless, it knew who the ball really was. It&#39;s still conscious, so every time I kick it, it will envy me, and what it lost,&quot; the replacement Chad said with sadistic glee.<br />
<br />
Karl picked up the ball, and whispered, &quot;How do you feel about the new gay you kicking you around ball boy?&quot; <br />
<br />
Chad couldn&#39;t answer, but he couldn&#39;t help but notice the wet spot on Karl&#39;s shorts.  He would love to have said no, but his air head mind reasoned that as long as somebody remembered who he really was, there was a chance he might be human again.  He wasn&#39;t sure how, but at least he wouldn&#39;t be forgotten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, just thinking about Chad kicking Chad around on the soccer field has be hard.  Okay, &quot;Chad&quot;, give me a blow job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessir!&quot;  the doppelganger was on his knees, licking his lips, and leaning eagerly into Karl&#39;s crotch, and went to work.<br />
<br />
Karl put the ball back down, and said to it, &quot;Pay attention, ball boy, if you&#39;re ever human again, I&#39;ll expect you to give head just like this Chad is doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, um, Kaul, fi itz ooman uhgun?&quot; the new Chad asked with his mouth full.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, yes, keep talking.  That tongue action is great.  I was thinking I could double my pleasure, and double my fun with one Chad sucking my balls while I fuck the other one&#39;s ass,&quot; Karl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMmmm, gwut uhduh!&quot; the doppelganger liked the idea of there being Chad One and Chad Two - then he would literally be able to fuck himself.  He wasn&#39;t sure if that idea was from the downloaded mind of the original Chad, or from Master Karl&#39;s personalized programming or if the new Chad had the idea all on his own, but it didn&#39;t matter as long as he was top Chad, and ball boy was bottom Chad.</p>
