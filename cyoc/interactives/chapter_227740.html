<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff got close enough to the farm to see it, he noticed that his dad, Douglas, was driving the tractor. Jeff also noticed that his dad was wearing overalls and boots but nothing else. Douglas had been a modest man who always wore button up shirts so this lack of clothing was a surprise.<br />
<br />
Jeff waved at his dad and Douglas stopped the tractor. Douglas walked briskly to greet his son in a bear hug. Douglas had never touched his son before because that was inappropriate touching but now Douglas grabbed Jeff by the back and butt and lifted him in the air.<br />
<br />
Douglas said, &quot;I heard the good news. The scouts from several universities have said that you have promise for an athletic scholarship.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas put Jeff down and Jeff asked, &quot;Really?&quot; but Douglas was too busy feeling up his son to answer.<br />
<br />
Douglas felt Jeff&#39;s arms first saying, &quot;Let me examine those fine muscles.&quot; Douglas then moved down Jeff&#39;s body. When he grabbed Jeff&#39;s cock through the sweat pants, Jeff blushed.<br />
<br />
Douglas asked, &quot;What are you blushing for? That&#39;s a fine poke stick you&#39;ve got. How many times have you poked a guy now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas said, &quot;I told you to keep a tally. I promised that on your hundredth poke, I&#39;d buy you a car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Jeff&#39;s memory came to him and he said, &quot;I&#39;ve poked seventeen times. I&#39;ve poked thirteen opponents but I poked a few of them twice in the same match. I poked poor Danny three times in one match and I wasn&#39;t the only one. By the end of the day, Dan was sure hollering about his sore ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas then walked around and grabbed Jeff&#39;s ass. &quot;And you&#39;re still keeping this tight to prevent from being poked, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his dad&#39;s hands attempting to invade his ass. &quot;Remember, dad, even the greatest have been poked. It&#39;s inevitable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas said, &quot;Yea, I know but you&#39;re preventing it most of the time. What&#39;s your tally?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Nine.&quot; but Jeff thought about how he&#39;d only been poked nine times officially. He didn&#39;t count all the unofficial times he&#39;d been poked. Jeff&#39;s dad wasn&#39;t interested in how well Jeff did in practice bouts or other unofficial bouts.<br />
<br />
They walked back toward the house with Jeff&#39;s dad walking behind Jeff. Jeff wondered about the hardness he felt bouncing off his butt as they walked but Jeff enjoyed his dad&#39;s hands massaging his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jeff was tackled by his brother, Jason. Jason was 17 and bigger but not as handsome as Jeff. &quot;Jeffy, congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stood up and started stripping his clothes off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you stripping?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
Jason answered, &quot;I don&#39;t want to get my clothes dirty. You better strip quickly before I rip your clothes off you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated. He saw more ripples from the book and wondered if anyone else noticed the ripples. The ripples had became less frequent meaning that the bulk of the changes had already been made but Jeff wondered what these new ripples had changed.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t get the chance to figure out as Jason tackled him and pulled his sweat pants down. When Jason went for Jeff&#39;s shirt, Jeff cried, &quot;Don&#39;t rip the shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shouted, &quot;You should have removed it when you had the chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff allowed Jason to pull his shirt over his head to keep from ripping the shirt. Then they stood facing each other stark naked. They circled each other.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad yelled, &quot;Come on Jeff, show us what your made of. Poke your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff got distracted and Jason took the opportunity to pick Jeff up and throw him in the nearby mud. Then Jason landed on top of Jeff and the match was on.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t have time to think much. He shut off his brain and let his subconscious training take over. It was like letting the force flow through him and move his muscles for him. Jeff focused all his attention on getting his cock inside that hole.<br />
<br />
The pleasure of slipping and sliding around each other made it easy to keep his poke stick primed and ready. Closer.. Closer... Almost there...<br />
<br />
Then he realized that he was about to poke his brother for the first time. That momentary thought cost him as he suddenly felt himself flipped around. Then he felt the invasion of his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAggghhh&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad said, &#39;That&#39;s okay. He&#39;s bigger than you. You almost had him. Losses are part of the game. Walk it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Jason didn&#39;t get up immediately. He basked for a bit in the glory of victory rubbing his cock back and forth a little. He started to pull out and then slammed in again. Then he repeated this.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad said, &#39;That&#39;s enough Jason. You won.&quot; Douglas grabbed the hand of Jason and raised it in victory as Jason stood up. Jeff laid there a moment catching his breath. Then he stood up.<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;Turn around. I want to see your hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitantly turned and felt his ass cheeks pulled apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bend over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked back at his dad but saw his dad&#39;s serious face so he bent over.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad said, &quot;You left white stuff in him, Jason. What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Sorry but you know it&#39;s wrong to have premarital sex. I get a lot of that white stuff building up inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad said, &quot;I suppose. You yungins can&#39;t help yourself. At least it&#39;s not as bad as that time Wayne filled you with seed, Jeff. Remember how he shot all over you until his seed was dripping down your face?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff remembered.<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;I thought Wayne was sexually active though. It&#39;s still a mystery how he shot so much seed in you instead of her. Let&#39;s get you two cleaned up before we go inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
They went over to the hose and Douglas began spraying his boys down. The water was freezing cold and the two boys danced in an out to get clean without freezing.<br />
<br />
When they were done, Jeff decided to prank his dad. He ran over and grabbed the hose and sprayed his dad.<br />
<br />
Dad moved out of the way and stripped of his clothes. &quot;That&#39;s it, you&#39;re asking for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas caught Jeff by surprise by skipping the starting positions and immediately picking Jeff up in the air. Before he realized it, he was caught in a standing full nelson with his dad&#39;s cock up his ass.<br />
<br />
Douglas proceeded to march Jeff into the kitchen keeping him in a full nelson and impaled.<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &#39;Uh, hi mom. What&#39;s for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mom, Molly, was a traditional mom who dressed up even for a day of housekeeping. She didn&#39;t wear pearls but she wore a full length dress. &quot;Shepherd&#39;s pie. Now don&#39;t leave white stuff all over my freshly cleaned floors. Get some clothes on and get ready for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dinner was pretty much the same as always except that dinner conversation was a lot more gay. Jeff still couldn&#39;t tell his family how much he was attracted to men but it was nice being able to talk about how much he loved wrestling. After chores, they even watched more wrestling as they settled down for the night.<br />
<br />
Jeff went to bed wondering what school would be like.</p>
