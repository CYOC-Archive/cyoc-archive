<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bull and I woke up late next morning, when the sun was already high. Apparently, Bull had pulled his dick out of me at some point during the night, because my ass felt rather empty. Of course, that wasn&#39;t very important right then.<br />
I yawned and kissed Bull on his wide mouth. &quot;Good morning&quot;, he smiled, and that made me feel all bubbly inside again.<br />
&quot;Good morning Bull&quot;, I replied, while getting up.<br />
I was shortly searching for my shirt, but then I remembered it&#39;s final fate yesterday. I considered grabbing a new one from my pack, but then decided to go without. I pulled on my pants though, as opposed to Bull, who was just leaving the tent in all his glorious nakedness. He had a small tail, swishing right and left, and his entire backside was covered in dense hair, furlike even.<br />
There was something new, as well. Where his feet were supposed to be, there were two solid horn plates, hooves, that gave him an admirable stability.<br />
He scratched his ass while I got out of the tent as well.<br />
&quot;Well, Urinal, I have to piss like an ox.&quot; <br />
I chuckled at the not so clever joke, but suddenly I got an idea.<br />
&quot;Hey, how about we take this to the wash house? That kinda feels right, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
Bull just shrugged his shoulders. &quot;As you like, sweety.&quot;<br />
I liked the nickname, but somehow I preferred to be called by my real name, Urinal. There was no need to argue though, I just lead the way to the abandoned wash house.<br />
We had only entered the place once, when we arrived, and that seemed like it was ages ago.<br />
Inside was only broken equipment and empty pipes sticking out of the walls and floor. I headed directly to one of the latter ones and chose the pipe that was rusted the least. Surprisingly, there was really one that seemed, as filthy and grimy as it was, to show no signs of rust.<br />
I let my sweatpants fall to my ankles and sat down on the pipe much like you would on a toilet, but was a bit disappointed. The waste pipe was much to big. I could sit on it no problem, but what I originally wanted, to connect, was absolutely impossible. I figured the diameter was at least two to three times the diameter of my asshole.<br />
Bull watched my feeble attempts to wiggle on to the pipe, before stepping up.<br />
&quot;Let me help you with that, Urinal&quot; he said gently. Without waiting for an answer, his two incredibly strong hands picked me up and lifted me a bit into the air. Then, with a sudden bulge in his arm muscles, he shoved me down with considerable force. I must admit, I expected the pain of a century, but instead, I just felt my ass widening incredibly wide and the pipe slide into it. It felt grimy and slimy, but it went in for a considerable amount, until my ass set down on the floor.<br />
My insides were rummaging and I felt a big slush of stuff flow inside the pipe, probably all that piss and cum from yesterday.<br />
I didn&#39;t really have time to concentrate on that, as Bull took his dick into his hand and stepped nearer. Opening my mouth wide and wider was considerably more easy than yesterday and with a mix of joy (because I was being a good urinal) and sadness (because it wouldn&#39;t add to my scent and filth), I managed to catch the full force of the stream that was hitting the back wall of my mouth.<br />
Just to be sure, I opened wider and wider, as Bull happily emptied his bladder inside of me. I could taste his piss, and feel it run down my throat, passing through my stomach and up into my pipe, that connected me to the ground.<br />
The sound of Bull&#39;s piss in my mouth changed a bit, while I was enjoying myself. From the wet sound of hitting flesh in my mouth, it became harder, like he was pissing against a solid material, like stone. No, like ceramic, I corrected myself.<br />
While he was filling me up, Bull looked around lazily, until something caught his eye. I couldn&#39;t see what it was from my position, but apparently it was interesting enough for him to lean over to the old washboard counter and reach for whatever he had seen, spraying his stream all over my body unintentionally while doing so (yay!).<br />
When he came back into view, he was holding a large metal ring in his hand.<br />
&quot;Look at that&quot;, he exclaimed, and showed it to me. &quot;A nose ring, just laying around in here.&quot;<br />
If I would have been able to talk, I would have voiced my concern about how unclean everything was in here, and that it was probably a good idea to clean the thing first before doing anything else.<br />
However, I was just an urinal, and urinals don&#39;t speak, they drink piss.<br />
After admiring the brass ring for a moment, Bull opened it up a bit, and then jabbed it into his own nose. I would have twitched if I had not been completely immobile. That must have hurt a lot.<br />
However, Bull showed no sign of pain, and I admired him for that. The ring looked a bit stupid though: it was much too big for his nose and even for his large face.<br />
Bulls stream trickled down now. I had almost forgotten I was being used, because the swallowing came just so natural for me now. He shaked away the last drops from his majestic cock and turned around, leaving without another word and without flushing.<br />
Of course he didn&#39;t flush, I corrected myself. It was not like there was running water here, and I wouldn&#39;t have been connected to it anyway.<br />
As I listened to the sound of his hooves on the tiled floor and then the old door swinging, I could see that there was a mirror on the opposite wall. Bulls bulky body must have obscured it from view before, but now I could see myself through the layer of dust and grime on the mirror.<br />
My face, no my hole body was being dominated by my mouth, which spanned at least two thirds of my size, open and ready for anyone who wanted to take a piss into me. It was rectangular, much like the rest of my body, which had taken on an artificial looking form. My hands were resting on the floor, as where my kneeling legs. Even if I could have moved, I would not have been able to lift them up, because they appeared to be bolted to the floor, giving me stability.<br />
My ass sat on the floor as well, securely fixing the waste pipe to my body.<br />
My cock was sticking out straight and had a metallic glean to it. I figured stepping on it would cause me to flush if there was running water. I didn&#39;t really mind the last of Bull&#39;s urine pooling in the back of my mouth though, the taste was heavenly.<br />
Except for the stinky mop of hair on my head, my body was entirely hairless, which I had to admit looked good on me.<br />
My entire body except for the cock was white and had a ceramic shine to it. Of course, it was not clean and shiny, but crusted, filthy and recently pissed on, giving me a really raunchy look.<br />
I sat there for several hours, patiently waiting for anything to happen and tasting Bulls urine in my mouth. Luckily, there were no flies in here like yesterday.<br />
Finally, mobility came back. The bolts fastening me to the floor came out and slowly, I could move my limps again. I was also able to close my mouth, although it did appear much larger than I was used to.<br />
In contrast, my body seemed to have shrunken in on itself a bit, leaving me a head shorter than before. Neither that nor the rectangular form really reverted, making me a strange sight to look at, like a walking urinal. Finally, the texture and color of my skin only reverted a bit. It still looked pretty much like soiled ceramic, but it was softer and warm. I could life with that: it only made my purpose clearer for the world to see. I tried to pull up my sweatpants and boxers, only to find them ill fitting to my new rectangular frame. I decided to ditch them all together and go naked, just like Bull.<br />
Speaking of which:<br />
He was doing push-ups when I exited the room and acknowledged me with a sweaty nod.<br />
I sat down on my camping chair and just enjoyed the show. There was a new development, I realized: Bull&#39;s entire face had warped forward, forming a wide muzzle with a big nose. The ring didn&#39;t look too big anymore, but was very well fitting. His ears had also enlarged as well as his beautiful brown eyes.<br />
All in all, Bull was now sporting a real bull&#39;s head, complete with long and manly horns, and it looked great on him.<br />
As his ass went up and down, I also noticed his tail, that was swishing like it had a mind of its own, had grown to proper bull proportions, completing the look of an upright human bull, like a minotaur from legend.<br />
When Bull was done with his sports, he proceeded to eat. Apparently, with his new muzzle came a new diet, as he just got down on all fours and started to graze. I, of course, was not hungry. I doubted I would ever need to eat again, I could sustain myself entirely from drinking Bull&#39;s piss.<br />
We talked afterwards: both of us were really happy here, and with each other. Although we would never have known we were gay - or a bull or an urinal for that matter, it just felt like that&#39;s what we were supposed to be. Nobody of us could imagine to just go back to his old life, so we just decided to stay here forever, living the lifes we were meant to live.<br />
We did. Bull was a massive bull man now, without much of an inhibition or intelligence. He ate and dropped cow pies as he liked, and of course, used me and made love to me a lot.<br />
I was his urinal, collecting and drinking his piss. I was often immobile and stood in the old wash house, but I always turned back into my current form afterwards. Apparently, the place was happy with me that way.<br />
I know I was. This existence, being here with Bull - all that was a dream come true. Not a dream I would ever have imagined, but now I was there, it was pure bliss. I loved this life and I loved Bull.</p>
