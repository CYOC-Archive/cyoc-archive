Back to the Ramseys and Nate… <br />
 <br />
Nate and Peyton Ramsey set the Ramsey’s small dinner table while Alex helped his mom in the kitchen. Nate was surprised just how skilled Alex was. He knew Alex was good, but not this good.<br />
<br />
“You never mentioned you could chop vegetables at light speed.” Nate said, making Alex blush at the compliment. Alex’s mother scolded him for being so bashful. <br />
<br />
“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about dear.”<br />
<br />
“Who said anything about being embarrassed? I’ve just never cooked in front of Nate before.” Alex said, cheeks burning even brighter. <br />
<br />
“Well shame on you. You two have been going out for what? A month?”<br />
<br />
“Only a couple of weeks Mom.” Alex corrected. They’d only “officially” been going out for about two weeks. But they’d been “enjoying” each other’s company since Nate moved to town. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, alright. Well, go help Nate and your father finish bringing the dishes to the table. I’m just about done here. I’ll be in in a second or two.” Alex’s mom shooed Alex away from the stove. Alex would have liked to finish, but knew better than to get in his mom’s way. <br />
<br />
“I told you my parents were going to humiliate me more than your mom did the other night.” Alex muttered to Nate as they walked to the dining room. <br />
<br />
“Please, that wasn’t that bad. Start throwing these chips around like they’re frisbees, then we might be even.” Nate pointed to the bowl full of disc shaped corn chips in his hands. Alex picked one up and popped it in his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Not a chance stud. I make the food, you’re the one who plays with it.” he said placing the bowl of cut up vegetables on the table. It was a “make your own” style dinner. Shelley Ramsey brought over the sizzling pieces of chicken to the table, setting them on a hot plate coaster. <br />
<br />
Much like the dinner at the Anderson’s, the beginning portion of the evening was spent eating and catching up on small talk. The Ramseys tried to avoid any subjects they thought might bring up William, just to be safe. They weren’t sure how healed Nate’s wounds were, and didn’t want to do anything to reopen them. <br />
<br />
“Do you have any idea what you might want to do in the future Nate?” Peyton asked about halfway through their dinner. <br />
<br />
“Not really. Just focusing on passing junior year right now. Thought about following Eric’s lead, joining the police force.” <br />
<br />
“You should do it because YOU want to, not just because your brother’s doing it.” Alex said. <br />
<br />
“I know, I’m only considering all the options. Truthfully I really don’t have a clue what I’m going to do after high school. College obviously, my mom would kill me if I didn’t continue my education. Who knows, maybe it’ll just hit me over the head one day.” Nate shrugged. <br />
<br />
He always hated everyone asking, “What do you want to be when you grow up?”. Nate always responded with the same cheeky answer; “I want to be me.” And Nate was still trying to figure out who he was. Everyone else seemed to have their life in order but him. <br />
<br />
Alex wanted to cook, Eric wanted to be a cop, Cassie wanted to be a doctor, and though Ben didn’t acknowledge it, Nate got the feeling he was going into the family business (aka psychology). <br />
<br />
“Did either of you know what you wanted to do when you were high school?” Nate asked, curious to get the Ramsey’s take on the matter. <br />
<br />
“Not really. I moved to town in my senior year. And the whole were thing threw me for a loop to say the least. After making the change, I doing the same thing you’re probably doing now. Adjusting. I think the first semester of college I spent goofing off and enjoying being a were.” Peyton remarked. <br />
<br />
“And how. By the time I got to the college you’d developed quite the reputation. ‘Pay it forward’ Peyton.” Shelley smiled at her husband. <br />
<br />
“Don’t remind me.” Mr. Ramsey sighed, putting one hand to his face. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want you getting any nicknames like that Alex. You keep your nose clean.”<br />
<br />
“Mom…” Alex’s face was turning red an awful lot tonight. Nate almost choked on his food when Alex’s mother mentioned something about Alex finishing school before he got any crazy ideas in his head like marriage or having pups. <br />
<br />
“Mom!” Alex swore his face must have been on fire it was so hot. <br />
<br />
“What? I’m sure Martha feels the same way.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely.” Nate nodded in agreement. He didn’t want to have kids at a young age anymore than his mom or the Ramseys did. The idea of having to finish college and raise kids was more like torture. And he wasn’t even sure how he and Alex would go about something like that. <br />
<br />
“The only two female wolves I know are Cassie and Megan. And there’s no way in hell I want my kid sharing DNA with Megan, or spending time in her womb. It’d be too awkward to ask Cassie. Of course then there’s her mom, ugh no that’d be even weirder. That would make the kid Eric’s brother in law, and nephew.” Nate’s thoughts went off the rail, and his eyes sort of glassed over. <br />
<br />
“Hello, earth to Nate?” Alex waved a hand in front of Nate snapping him back into reality. And once again, in his startled state, Nate launched a bean from his quesadilla into the air. Thankfully it landed on his plate, at which point Alex started rolling with laughter. <br />
<br />
“Does sending your food into the stratosphere make it taste better?” Alex teased. Nate blushed and muttered an apology. <br />
<br />
“Oh be quiet Alex. You’ve done your fair share of food throwing. Remember your seventh birthday party?” <br />
<br />
“Oh come on Dad, don’t tell…”<br />
<br />
“Listens to one of his brilliant friends, and sticks a piece of cake into his pants, and then throws another piece across the room. Real class act, son.” Peyton chuckled to his son’s embarrassment. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…<br />
<br />
Martha and Eric were having a significantly quieter meal across town, as it was just the two of them. It was the first time in a long time they’d had any alone time. Also the first time they hadn’t spent that alone time crying. But everyone’s wounds were healing, slowly but surely. <br />
<br />
Eric told his mom all about his day. Skipping over some of the more intimate parts, like his evening activities with Cassie. Martha didn’t have much to report. She decided not to tell Eric about her “date” with Kat. It was a bit premature, as she wasn’t even sure what kind of relationship they had, or were going to have. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Have you given any thought to what kind of present you’re going to get Cassie for her birthday?” Martha asked as they finished up their leftovers. <br />
<br />
“Not really. Actually I was kinda hoping you could help. I was going to ask Nate, but, well, I seriously doubt he knows what girls like.” Eric’s cheeks turned pink. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I’ll help you find something for Cassie. What does she like? Books, music, that kind of stuff.” <br />
<br />
“Uh… you know I don’t really know. We’ve been busy talking about everything else except those things. We just jumped straight into the serious parts. Is that bad?”<br />
<br />
“No. Considering how the relationship started in the first place, it was probably the natural thing to do. And it just means you two are in tune with each other. You and Cassie may have had a rough start, but I know things can only get better.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks Mom.” Eric leaned over to hug his mom. She smiled and patted Eric’s head of dark hair. Even if he smelled like the wolf, a tiny bit was more familiar, and close to home. The tiny portion that was still holding onto William, and Eric’s normal scent. It made Martha smile, and hope for the best moving forward. <br />
