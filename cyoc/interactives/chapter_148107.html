<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If what he knew of the curse, Mathew figured that, because he hadn&#39;t given in, Linus was not only safe, but also it should provide a way out of not only the cabin, but also the woods. Tromping through the underbrush, listening as the man made a hooting noise every so often, Mathew tried to find any holes in what he saw as something that not seemed the most logical, but also made the most sense. Taking a deep breath, he glanced back at Linus to make sure the man was okay, noted he was still clutching tightly the plush Unicorn, and turning away, Mathew tried to decide if they should continue in the direction they were headed or maybe veer off to either the right or left.<br />
<br />
Behind him, unconcerned that he was following someone he&#39;d only met a couple hours earlier, or that he was still in only his pyjamas, Linus made a series of soft hooting noises and tried to block out what was really bothering him. Clutching tightly his plush, he tried to work out why the thing that made water would not return to its normal state of being and whether the insistent feeling of wanting to touch it was in some way connected. Drawing no conclusion, he looked about for the sister, the mother or the father, thinking they could help, but then he remembered that they weren&#39;t with him and the girl with the face of a boy was going to lead him back to the them. Trying to find some way to distract himself, he softly hooted, &quot;Mathew will help,&quot; as he thought about a story he had started writing.<br />
<br />
In front of him, so lost in his own thoughts, Mathew didn&#39;t hear it when Linus whispered his name. Instead, his mind was on other matters, including trying to find a way out of the woods. Certain he was on to something when he decided that, because Linus had resisted the curse, it would not effect him and thus escape was possible, he stopped and gazed about the forest. Feeling hot and rather flushed, he wondered if he was getting sick as he absent rubbed his chest. Failing to make the connection that what he was feeling was arousal, he mentally found himself glad that, for the first time in what seemed like days, he didn&#39;t have a raging hard on.<br />
<br />
Still not seeing anything that appeared to be the edge of the forest, Mathew experienced a flash of doubt. But then he mentally reasoned, &quot;Think about it. If it didn&#39;t work, you would surely have found your way back to the cabin by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
A belief that he was safe so long as he remained with Linus stole over him and absently still rubbing his chest, the warmth starting to settle in specific places, including between his legs, Mathew glanced back at his odd companion. Seeing that the man was staring idly up at the trees, Mathew started to turn away, but then realised that the man, every so often, would reach down and adjust himself.<br />
<br />
Troubled by this, especially as he could see that, every time Linus fiddled with himself, that he was sporting an erection, Mathew began to breath heavily. Disturbing images of wanting to go to Linus, to suckle at the man&#39;s cock, to tease it, to place it between his legs came briefly to Mathew and quickly turning away, he shook his head. Thinking, &quot;No,&quot; he decided on a direction as he told himself, &quot;I shan&#39;t give in. I shall not condemn this man to being cursed. We can escape it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind him, completely oblivious to Mathew&#39;s problems, Linus hooted a couple times. When he became aware that the girl with the face of a boy had started walking, he uttered a hooting noise that sound like, &quot;Over hill, over dale.&quot; Hugging his plush tight, he followed after.<br />
<br />
As he did this, Linus tried to put out of his mind his problem. But, he was discovering that the more he tried, the more insistent these alien feelings became. Looking at Mathew, his mind suddenly leapt to a notion he had never experienced as he pictured the girl with the boy&#39;s face laying down and he, Linus, lying on top of him, thrusting the thing that made water into a blank spot. Concerned about these thoughts, he peered upward and tried to return to making up a story about the leaves in the trees.<br />
<br />
In front of him, Mathew veered wildly in as many different directions as he could, sometimes even crossing brooks or, once or twice, stepping into the really shallow water and following it up toward its source or down in the same direction the water was running. Not caring that his shoes were getting soaked, he tried to focus on the way ahead, but continuously found himself looking to either his left or right, glancing surreptitiously at Linus as he did and liking what he was seeing. Trying to tell himself, &quot;You are not a girl. You should not even be checking out another guy. You like girls, not boys&quot; Mathew found even this sort of distraction didn&#39;t help as he imagined what he could do to help Linus alleviate what was clearly an issue for the man.<br />
<br />
Absently, he again rubbed his chest, ran his hand up and down his chin and chuckled nervously. As he did this, he choose a new direction and muttered, &quot;I mean. Get off it. You aren&#39;t even horny. Your dick is still flaccid,&quot; and realising he had said this aloud, he peered back at Linus and, noticing the other was a lot closer then he had thought, Mathew felt like something shifted.<br />
<br />
Unaware that he was now staring lustfully at the other, Linus was trouble. It was as if someone or something else had come into his mind and was directing him. Yet, somehow knew this wasn&#39;t entirely accurate and what was happening was one of those moments where the connections were suddenly made. Taking a step toward Mathew, he knew what the insistent feeling meant, how to make the thing that made water return to its resting state, all of it, it seemed so clear. As if watching himself from a distance, he shifted his plush so that it was held securely between his upper arm and his body before he reached out, placed his hands on the girl with the face of a boy&#39;s shoulders and gently began to massage them.<br />
<br />
The curse having taken full control of Linus, it worked more and more on Mathew, who continued to resist, even as his resolve continued to slip. When he glanced back at the other, missing the look he was being given, he felt a powerful urge to go to the man, to allow himself to be taken. When Linus stepped closer and placed his hands on Mathew&#39;s shoulders, the twenty-five year old man made the connection that, somehow, he was sexually aroused. Wanting to tell the younger man to stop, that they shouldn&#39;t, Mathew instead leaned back and in a sensual tone, whispered, &quot;Mmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smoothly, Linus got Mathew to turn to face him. As he did this, lost in everything that was happening, and finding it was a titbit enjoyable, he drew the other closer. As he did this, the older man tried to resist, but then felt his resolve give way when Linus kissed him. Suddenly wanting the other, Mathew panted heavily, reached down, placed his hand&#39;s in the younger man&#39;s pyjama bottoms, and began using his fingernails to delicately tease the tip of Linus&#39; cock. A combination hoot-moan escaping the other at such an intimate touch, he pressed himself closer, knowing what he needed, even if nothing of what was happening would have made sense any other time.<br />
<br />
At some point, Mathew lost his shirt and shoes, whilst Linus had set aside his plush and somehow managed to step out of his pyjama bottoms. One man naked from the waist up, the other naked from the waist down, Mathew almost managed to regain control of himself, but then he saw the large, erect member Linus was sporting. The two kissing, pawing, groping, breathing heavily, both missed what was happening to them as Linus&#39; tailbone began to extend and Mathew&#39;s scrotum pulled tighter and flatter back between his legs.<br />
<br />
Suddenly wanting his pants off, Mathew began fumbling clumsily with the garment and as his testicles pulled back up into his body and his scrotum reformed into a labia, the twenty-five-year-old gave up trying to undo them and instead resorted to pushing them down. Fully naked, he pushed Linus back against a tree as he stepped out of the last of his clothes. The other, following the cues of the other, had a brief flash that something wasn&#39;t right when he felt something behind him pinch. But then he lost interest as Mathew leaped up, straddled the other and as the opening that was his vagina formed, he started making a gentle rocking motion, finding the stimulation of Linus&#39;s dick rubbing against the area between his legs so enjoyable, it threatened to send him into an orgasm right then and there.<br />
<br />
The curse still working over the two, guiding Mathew to his first female experience and helping Linus make the connections necessary to do what needed to be done, both failed to see any more what was happened as the younger man guided the older man to the forest floor. Linus&#39; tail fully formed, and hair starting to cover it, all it needed was the final release to cement the changes as his semen, which had changed from human to equine, geared up to be released. Beneath him, Mathew caught a brief flash of Linus&#39; tail and for a split second, he knew they shouldn&#39;t. But then, as his vagina formed, his testicles moved deeper into his body, the cervix, uterus and Fallopian tubes came into being, he lost everything as Linus slid his cock inward.<br />
<br />
Neo-vaginal juices making the tunnel moister, a gasp at the slightly pinched sensation and for a moment, Mathew tried to say, &quot;No. We shouldn&#39;t,&quot; and to beg the other to take it out. But as Linus began to rhythmically thrust back and forth, the twenyt-five-year-old found his words didn&#39;t mean much and what he actually wanted was to be brought to the height of sexual release. Ovaries forming, his testicles attaching themselves to the bottom of them, Mathew spread his legs as far as they would go, arched his back, pivoted his hips to match the other&#39;s motions and moaned. And as the last vestiges of their transformation took effect, the pumping of female hormones as well as male hormones for Mathew and the ability to swish his tail for Linus, the two came, cementing in place the changes that left one man with an extended coccyx and the other with a tiny penis, a labia and fully functional female and male reproductive organs.</p>
