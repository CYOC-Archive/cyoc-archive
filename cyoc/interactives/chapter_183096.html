<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He decided to alter himself first. Taking a swig of beer from the can to calm himself, he expanded the profile window for himself to fill the entire screen, minimizing Chris&#39;s. Wryly he thought how he would use that to minimize Chris himself later.<br />
<br />
As before, the options relating to his physical statistics, mental statistics, and personality statistics were on the left-hand side of the screen whereas a naked Avatar of himself was displayed on the right-hand side. Looking critically, Daren saw a relatively good-looking twenty-five-year-old of average height, nothing spectacular but not a dog either. But he could also see where the demands of his job and city living had been taking their toll, his body was beginning the long and inexorable process of softening into a &#39;Dad Bod&#39;. He also noticed his hairline was beginning to recede. Under the physical characteristics section of the menu, there was an &#39;Age&#39; slider. He clicked the widget and dragged it slowly to the right, the age of the avatar increasing year by year with every increment.<br />
<br />
His avatar lost all muscle definition within five years, his stomach beginning to distend outwards and his pectorals morphing into perky little manboobs. Within ten years his head of hair had gone, migrating across the rest of this body to form a downy layer and leaving a shiny, naked pate behind. Within twenty years the worst of his Greek genes had come to dominate, leaving an almost stereotypical rotund, hairy and oleaginous butterball. <br />
<br />
He looked like his Uncle Alex. He reached for the can of beer again and drained it to steady his nerves. What good looks he had were doomed to fade away, were already in fact fading away. He dragged the age slider back till it displayed his current age. He already knew he wasn&#39;t going to allow himself to end up like that. But he knew that what he would become had its seeds in what he was now. <br />
<br />
An overhaul was required. But what kind? What kind of man did he want to be? What he saw had repulsed him and he knew it would have repulsed Chris. Shiny, smooth, and perky Chris hated bears. Daren snorted; Chris was always lusting after those models you saw on the television selling aftershave. The beautiful men with perfect bodies, shot in black and white, wearing the most stylish clothes.<br />
<br />
And in that thought, he knew he had determined his future and he set to work editing, moving through each characteristic in turn.<br />
<br />
He looked at the age slider again. There was a checkmark at the bottom &#39;LOCK AGE&#39;. He moused over it and a tooltip appeared, &#39;Locks Subject Age at the specified level. DOES NOT CONFER IMMORTALITY, the subject will retain natural lifespan but will not age&#39;. He check it and options appeared for disease immunity and infirmity immunity, both of which he checked as a matter of course.<br />
<br />
He decided to leave his age at twenty-five, fully mature, and an indisputable adult. That was going to be important for later in helping establish who was in charge. And to reinforce that he dragged his height upwards from its current five foot ten to six foot three. There was still room to go further. Many of the physical characteristic sliders seemed to be able to go beyond what a normal human could achieve, but Daren didn&#39;t want that. He wanted to be an exceptional specimen, but not a freakishly impossible one. He decided he would stay within the bounds of possibility.<br />
<br />
His race he left as Greek, no need to alter that, though he did shift his skin tone more towards the golden olive tone typical of the Mediterranean. He watched as his perky red areolae darkened to brown.<br />
<br />
His brown hair he turned to a lush black, and he set it to be naturally lush and tousled whilst removing any possibility it would ever thin or degrade as time went by. He toned down the body hair growth on the rest of his body except for his armpits and pubic region. He didn&#39;t want to end up like his Uncle Alex.<br />
<br />
His body he was disturbed, but not surprised, to learn was somewhere between an Endomorph and a Mesomorph and as he had realized earlier, the Endomorph side would come to dominate. He moved that slider firmly to the Mesomorph side, the avatar&#39;s musculature reshaping itself in response. He then bulked up his muscles and increased their definition. <br />
<br />
He took particular care with his face as he reshaped it. He wanted to remain recognizably himself but in an idealized form. He tweaked his eye shape, the size of his nose, the spread of his lips, the position of his cheekbones. It took over an hour of minute manipulations, but the straining erection within his pants told him he&#39;d been successful if he&#39;d popped a woody at what he was going to be. His new face was going to be the epitome of masculine beauty.<br />
<br />
His penis he didn’t mess much with in terms of size. He’d had a bit of fun earlier making it a monster, but it was already pretty substantial and he didn’t want to become freakish. He increased it’s length to eight inches and fiddled with the shape somewhat, making it aesthetically pleasing. His dick was straining within his jeans, so he opened the fly and let it spill out. He gave himself a few pleasurable tugs before continuing.<br />
<br />
And then it was finished. His Avatar was him, but with all flaws removed and with beauty enhanced. Not only would he not look out of place in one of those stylishly shot commercials Chris drooled over, but people would question why he wasn&#39;t there right now. It took all his self control to not click the apply button then and there. There were still other factors to take care of.<br />
<br />
He clicked &#39;mental&#39; and saw it included sliders for his intelligence, emotional intelligence, logic, deduction, reasoning and learning skills.<br />
He just maxxed them out.<br />
<br />
Next he opened the final section, personality. He wanted to remain himself, but there were aspects of his character he felt he could fix.<br />
His charisma he increased dramatically. His sense of drive he also increased. He left his sense of ambition alone though, he knew what he wanted to achieve with the Chronivac and he was wise enough even now to know that unbridled ambition could lead him down some unintended paths. His anger levels he increased, but his level of self control he maxxed out. His anger would serve him rather than the other way around. His need to dominate and his ability to dominate he also maxxed out. He intended to be in charge. A few personality settings, such as &#39;Defiance&#39; were grayed out for him.<br />
<br />
There was a sub-menu marked sexuality. He opened it up. It displayed his sexuality as 80% towards Homosexual end of the spectrum. He casually dragged the slider towards the centre. Somewhere close to the centre it displayed his sexuality as 30% towards the Homosexual end of the spectrum (Bisexual tendencies). A thought occurred to him then. And he smiled. He dragged the slider a little bit more till he was 15% towards the Homosexual end of the spectrum (pronounced Bisexuality) and then he stopped. This would be perfect, he knew exactly what he was going to do with this.<br />
<br />
He scrolled down towards &#39;Kinks and turn ons&#39;. It listed Ephebophiliac. There was an option to remove it. He stared at it for a few moments. If only a few hours ago someone had given him a switch that could have removed these desires from his head, he would have taken it gladly. Here was the option to do so. It would be the right thing to do, surely?<br />
<br />
Except, he thought with a wry smile, whatever I do is moral now. <br />
<br />
He left it in place. His other kinks were there. Uniforms. Infantilisation. Dominance. Humiliation (Dispensing). There were sliders next to each kink emphasisng the level of enjoyment he got out of them. He cranked it up on all of them.<br />
<br />
He took a few minutes to go through the changes again, reviewing every single aspect of what would be the new Daren Adamos the moment he clicked submit. There were a few tiny tweaks here or there but once he was done he felt satisfied.<br />
<br />
He finished off his can of beer, now lukewarm. With shaking hand, he moved the mouse pointer over &#39;Submit&#39;. He clicked it.</p>
