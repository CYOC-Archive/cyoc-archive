<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaida Moreland huffed in annoyance, slamming her door perhaps a bit too hard as she found herself brooding in her room. How could her mother not allow her to go hang out with her friends at the mall by themselves, she was 11 now, turning 12 in a few months. It was so unfair.<br />
<br />
Letting out an exasperated sigh the young girl now studied herself in the mirror. Kaida was taking her first steps into adulthood, her breasts beginning to bud with the slightest amount of curve to her hips. Couple that with her shoulder length blonde hair and emerald green eyes and it was no wonder that seventh grade boy wanted to go steady. Now, he would probably end up going steady with that bitch, Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, mom is so unfair.&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
Huffing in annoyance, Kaida now glanced outside as a car now pulled up to the Moreland residence. Kaida recognized her Uncle Chase and Aunt Charlotte&#39;s car, and if they were here did that mean?<br />
<br />
Kaida could feel her pulse quicken as she watched Aaron now exit the car. Holding back a girlish scream, Kaida now quickly fixed her hair as she bolted down the stairs to see Chase, Charlotte, and of course Aaron.<br />
<br />
Gazing at Connor and Spark&#39;s home, a small smile spread across Aaron&#39;s face. The trip to see the couple was planned as well as personal. The planned portion was bringing the couple some of Nina&#39;s famous fried chicken. Spark had only returned home yesterday, leaving Connor to care for their four children. As good as a father, he was, Nina felt he could use a breather.<br />
<br />
The second reason was personal for Chase and Aaron. While the two were tight lipped about who they were dating, asking Caleb&#39;s opinion was a no go, but maybe they could find a more reasonable side with Connor? Connor was the more level headed of the brothers, taking a moment to think things through. If they could get an idea of what Connor thought of the Tepes family, maybe they could get some advice on dating Andromeda and Nyx.<br />
<br />
As they approached the house, Charlotte and Aaron waved as Jay and Cali bolted out of the house. Jay, age 8, and Cali, age 6, were the second and third of Connor&#39;s children. Giggling the two blonde haired kids hugged Charlotte before leaping at Chase. A hearty laugh now escaped Chase&#39;s lips as the two young children hung off his muscular biceps as if they were monkey bars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful you two,&quot; Connor called. &quot;Last thing I need is one of you cracking your skull after playing with Uncle Chase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll be fine Connor,&quot; Chase grinned. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay and Cali giggled, nodding their small heads as Connor shook his head. Sometimes he wasn&#39;t sure who was more trouble, his children or Chase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s good to see you,&quot; Connor smirked. &quot;C&#39;mon in and keep the kids safe. Spark just went to grab Colton.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase nodded, the pair entering Connor&#39;s home. Glancing around the living room, the young trio could see a home made of love. Numerous family photos hung on the walls, pictures of the kids scattered on tables, a few drawings the children had done hung with pride, and finally toys scattered all over the living room floor. It was a charming sight for Chase, Aaron, and Charlotte as they maneuvered their way towards the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Spark called. Aaron, Chase, and Charlotte turned, noting the fairy turned human carrying her youngest son, Colton. The 18 month old appeared to be drifting off for a nap, a look of relief on the green haired woman&#39;s face. Although Spark had put on some weight after four children, she still maintained a relatively trim figure with only a C section scar along her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Spark,&quot; Charlotte grinned. &quot;How was the trip?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exhausting,&quot; Spark groaned. &quot;Freaking werewolves, then I come home and I get to deal with my oldest. Not sure which is worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Kaida?&quot; Chase asked.<br />
<br />
The sound of footsteps barreling down the stairs made the trio turn as the preteen now came into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chase Aunt Charlotte.&quot; she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kaida,&quot; the twins smiled. &quot;Come give us a hug.&quot; Kaida smiled softly, giving her aunt and uncle a side hug, the all too familiar sign of a growing adolescent. Kaida now turned to Aaron, the girls cheeks flushing slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aaron.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kaida,&quot; he replied. &quot;How&#39;s school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m mean it&#39;s not bad so far,&quot; Kaida shrugged. &quot;I mean it&#39;s middle school now. Did you know my birthday is coming up soon? I&#39;m going to be 12. Pretty soon, I&#39;m going to be driving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really growing up Kaida.&quot; Aaron stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know right,&quot; Kaida said excitedly. &quot;So..um do you think you can give me driving lessons?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not getting driving lessons Kaida,&quot; Spark exclaimed. &quot;You only 11!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not some little kid Mom,&quot; Kaida countered. &quot;Ugh why do you treat me like a kid? My bra is almost as big as yours! Ugh, why do you try to embarass me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaida now stormed off, the sound of Kaida&#39;s footsteps echoing through the house as she sounded up the stairs before slamming the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, freaking preteens.&quot; Spark grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure she gets that from you.&quot; Connor smirked as he entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s bullshit Connor Moreland,&quot; Spark countered furrowing her brown. &quot;I did not act like that when I was a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what Nova told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark scowled, narrowing her eyes as she stared daggers at her husband. Connor simply smirked, leaning on his cane as he watched his wife. He so rarely had a chance to poke fun at Spark that he took it when it came. Deep down, Spark couldn&#39;t argue. Kaida was her mini me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m putting Colton down and taking a short nap,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Make sure the kids eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dear,&quot; Connor grinned. &quot;Love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark grunted out an I love you too. The irony of her stomping out of the room and slamming her door like her daughter not lost on anyone. Connor simply chuckled, taking Nina&#39;s food from his brother and sister.<br />
<br />
Making plates for the children was easy enough. Jay and Cali sitting down as they scarfed down their grandmother&#39;s meal. Aaron, Chase, and Charlotte now helped themselves as well, while Connor brought a plate to his oldest child.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s Kaida?&quot; Charlotte asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well her head didn&#39;t spin in a circle when I brought her her food,&quot; Connor replied sheepishly. &quot;Still, she&#39;s real mad at her mom. She wanted me to tell you sorry Aaron.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me,&quot; asked Aaron. &quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase, Connor, and Charlotte now looked at one another before bursting onto laughter. Aaron still confused by what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude she&#39;s got a crush on you.&quot; Chase laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously,&quot; Aaron exclaimed. &quot;But..but I&#39;m like twice her age!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a school girl crush,&quot; Charlotte stated, the young woman slowly rising to her feet. &quot;I&#39;ll go check on her, maybe sit down for some girl talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Charlotte left, Jay and Cali finished their meals. Excusing themselves, the two now sprinted off enjoying themselves in the setting November sun. Aaron and Chase were now left alone with Connor. Perhaps this was the opportunity Chase was waiting for.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Connor said. &quot;Mom tells me you two found girlfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of,&quot; Aaron blushed. &quot; They&#39;re sisters, we kinda just ran into them. Things have been going well. Maybe..maybe we can bring them over someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind that,&quot; Connor smirked. &quot;Happy you two found someone special.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron and Chase nodded, the pair looking between each other. So far Connor seemed thrilled for them. The concern though was, what his opinion of the Tepes family was. Connor may be happy for Chase and Aaron, but would he still feel like that if he discovered the sisters were Tepes?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Connor,&quot; Chase said slowly. &quot;I&#39;ve been wondering if I could talk to you about the Tepes family.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mood in the kitchen changed, Connor&#39;s warm smile vanishing. The man&#39;s face twisted, his brow furrowing as he gripped his cane tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Chase said nervously. &quot;I was just wondering. Do you think the Tepes family is as bad as we thought? After all....they can&#39;t all be bad. Can they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor said nothing, instead turning to gaze out his kitchen windows. Cali and Jay were currently jumping in a pile of leaves, leaves Connor had to cleanup at some point.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Dad used to hold you in the palm of his hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad,&quot; Connor replied. &quot;He used to hold you in the palm of his hand. Dad had pretty big hands. When you and Charlotte were born, he would take turns holding you and her. I was still a kid, but I would see the look on his face when he did. He was happy, but he wished he could hold both of you. The Tepes family took that away from him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor I..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me finish Chase,&quot; Connor continued. &quot;At least give me that.&quot; Chase nodded, as Connor took a deep breath. &quot;The Tepes family nearly killed Dad once. Had their assassin, Ann, tear his arm clean off his body. Few years later, they finished the job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor I..I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They killed Dad,&quot; said Connor. &quot;Killed my old nanny too, a golem named Daphne. Daphne meant a lot to me when I was a kid, always looked out for me, took care of me, and the Tepes assassin once again took something important in our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Connor,&quot; Chase said softly. &quot;I won&#39;t ask again. Let&#39;s just drop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not finished.&quot; Connor said firmly. Chase and Aaron now quieting. They had never seen this look on Connor&#39;s face. He had always been the calm, level headed brother. The brother who always had a kind word or wanted to take a measured response. Now, he had a pained and vengeful look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already know what happened to me,&quot; Connor said, his voice frightening despite being barely audible. &quot;So, I won&#39;t go over that again. Tell me though, do you have any idea what it&#39;s like, to not play with your kids? To not be able to teach your kids how to ride a bike? To not be able to carry your kids to bed because you&#39;re afraid your hip will give out? To have the love of your life look at you, like you&#39;re made of glass?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase and Aaron shook their heads no. Quietly watching Connor as the man watched his children run. &quot;The Tepes family broke my body,&quot; he said. &quot;But worse, they broke my life. There are things that I&#39;ll never be able to do as a father....and it&#39;s because of the Tepes family. I could forgive them for what happened to me, I can never forgive them for taking things away from my kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor turned to face his brother and friend, he looked exhausted, his eyes glossy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a moment alone.&quot; he sighed.<br />
<br />
Chase and Aaron nodded, quietly leaving the kitchen as Connor remained. For the two friends they realized that dating the Tepes sisters wasn&#39;t going to be as easy as they hoped.<br />
<br />
Chase now took a deep breath before looking at Aaron, and Aaron realized his friend had another idea on his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what is it this time? What&#39;s your brillaint plan now?&quot; Aaron sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I know this sounds like suicide to do again, but....&quot; Chase began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to go back to the vampire realm.&quot; Aaron finished knowing what Chase was going to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, listen don&#39;t argue with me on this, but hear me out. Convincing our families that our girlfriends aren&#39;t bad might be a little hard, so why don&#39;t we go and try to convince their parents that we&#39;re good material for them?&quot; Chase lined out his idea as Aaron took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know, I&#39;m not doing this for you or me, I&#39;m doing this for Nyx. I...I...really do love her and I want her to be happy. So if this will make her happy, then I&#39;ll go along with your crazy scheme.&quot; Aaron said as Chase smiled. Now he might have to ask another favor from his cousin Tammy, and knew she might not like it. But sometimes love makes you do crazy things.</p>
