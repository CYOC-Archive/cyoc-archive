<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Ty could finish his sentence the headless multilimbed orc woman shouldered past him and picked up a vial at random, one which Ty had not tested before.  “Wait!  You can’t drink that!  We have no idea what it will do to you.  You could even revert to how you were, or worse!” Ty exclaimed, but his friend was having none of it.  Steph pushed Ty away as another pair of arms uncorked the bottle.  The orc bent over, baring her shapely ass, and with one set of arms spread her cheeks as a third arms popped the bottle in her ass and let the liquid flow in.  Steph stood up and waited for the, hopefully beneficial, changes to begin.  There was a gurgling sound coming from her groin and Ty watched in curious horror as Steph’s already massive pussy began to widen further and further until there was an audible ripping noise echoed through the room and Steph fell to his knees, then fell onto his back.  Looking down, Ty saw what had happened; amazingly Stephs monster pussy had reduced in size, but the reason for that was it had increased in number.  Now the orc female had not one, but two large, yet smaller than their previous incarnation, twitching green cunts.<br />
<br />
The eyes above them squinted in disgust and Steph chucked the bottle across the room as his upper arms picked up another bottle.  Ty pounced on his friend, trying to rip the bottle away but with so many arms Steph had no trouble keeping the elftaur away.  The cork came off and once more the potion was absorbed into the orcs ass.  Through his struggle, Ty was just able to see his friends breasts, already modest Cs, inflate until they grew bigger than Ty’s own head, and the dark green nipples grew as wide around as the palm of his hand and with nipples as thick as soda cans and almost as long.  To his amazement the breasts did not sag at all and seemed quite firm, likely due to the orcs strong musculature.  Disappointed once more, the orc chucked the bottle against the wall and reached for another.<br />
<br />
Once more the bottle went up Steph’s ass and it hungrily drank it down, this time with the entire potion being consumed in one go.  The bottle clattered to the floor and Steph went limp, then jolted back to life as all six hand began to itch at the spot where his head had once been.  Ty backed up and watched as two bumps began to push themselves out from between Stephs broad shoulders.  The mounds rapidly expanded outward, taking on familiar shapes as features began to form on the lumps of flesh.  A nose, short pointy ears, then eyes, lips, and  a short black mohawk appeared on each of the growing heads.  After a few moments of fleshing out the heads had become fully formed, exact copies of the head the orc character had previously sported.  The heads gasped in unison and began to look around the room in a panic.  They moved in tandem, when one head looked left, the other did too, and their eyes moved in exactly the same way.  In unison both heads screamed, “Oh fuck my vision I’m seeing three of-oh my god I can talk again I have a head aaaAAAAHHHh why do I have two heads Ty wha-!”, but the Steph heads were interrupted as Ty’s four fingered green hand slapped first the right head, then the left.  Mostly to stop Steph from freaking out, but also to get a little retribution from the rough play from earlier.<br />
<br />
“Snap out of it dude!  If you chill for a sec the potion will normalize your body!”  Both heads stared blankly at him, along with the eyes resting above the two pussies.  Steph’s massive tits rose and fell as the heads breathed in slowly, waiting for the adjustment to come.  After several moments of severe confusion, the Stephs seemed to calm down.  A bit.  <br />
<br />
As one, they said, “Oh man, this is really messing with my head, er, heads…” they said.  “It’s like, this is all me, but I can see in three different places at once.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Steph said as he hoisted his friend up to a standing position, “at least you have a head again.  Even if it is two. Are you happy now?”<br />
<br />
The left head and right heads stared at the floor, and, was Ty just imagining it or was that dark green flush the heads blushing?  “It’s a lot better than when I started, not as good as when we first got here, but now man I’m just so…” a hand rubbed the twin cunts in his crotchs while another grabbed a huge tit, “… I’m a mess of parts dude.  And these, er, feelings are starting to get to me.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I certainly understand you, believe me I do,” he said trying not to think about his own collection of genitals resting in his rear, “but I don’t think we can do anything about it until we finish this quest.  We’re just going to have to adjust to this as best we can.  Now, do you think you’re good to go?  We need to find Aaron and Eric, who hopefully have been faring better than us.”  <br />
<br />
The two heads laughed and all three sets of eyes lit up, “Damn, I hope you’re right.  Ok, I’m with you man, you seem to have your head on right about this,”. An echoed pair of laughs came out from Steph’s heads and even Ty giggled a little.  “Let’s get out of here and get our buds and hopefully undo all of…” the six arms gestured vaguely, “…this.”<br />
<br />
Ty nodded in agreement and the two set about preparing to leave the goblin settlement.  Ty was able to cobble together some robes he found in the huts into a outfit for his tau body, one robe tied around his upper torso, another longer one tied around his bottom half with a split in the middle to allow for his tail.  A make shift set of clothes worked as underwear to help keep his long cock tucked away.  Steph meanwhile settled for a more free look and wrapped some clothe over his chest that just barely held in huge breasts.  Down south Steph had wrapped a bolt of cloth around his hips and ass in a makeshift thong, one that left enough room for his third set of eyes to see and only just contain his pair of fat cunts.  The two managed to arm themselves, Ty with a longbow, arrows, and a twin pair of daggers.  Steph brandished six shorts word with six matching sheaths looped onto her large hips.  Each also had a satchel full of whatever supplies they could carry, and unbeknownst to Ty, Steph had snuck around a dozen of the goblin alchemist potions into his rucksack.  Having done all they could the two set off.</p>
