<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Possession.&quot;<br />
Alec was sitting in a chair. A cry of rage, mixed in with a large amount of confusion as Alem tried to fight the guard in his impaired shape.<br />
The two other guards led him away.<br />
&quot;Thank you for delivering him to us.&quot; The larger guard said. He handed Alec a small pouch. &quot;There was a price on his head. I had a long discussion with the treasurer about this. He was of the opinion that Alem technically turned himself in. I don&#39;t like technicalities.&quot;<br />
Alec smiled and took the pouch. To his delight it was heavier than it looked. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec and Vivian were walking down the busy streets. Things didn&#39;t go exactly as planned, but he was another step closer to his potential cure. He player with the pouch of coins. It felt reassuring to be holding actual money in his hands again. So far everything else had gone through his adventurers pass. <br />
One ingredient remained on his list.<br />
&quot;So where are we going now? The minotaurs?&quot;<br />
Vivian shrugged. &quot;I get that&#39;s where you want to go. But I&#39;m not ready yet. And I think you should hold your horses before you go running off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; He asked as they turned a corner and arrived back on the open square. It was crowded as usual with small kids playing in the fountain while mothers talked.<br />
Alec noted some new species near the fountain though, some green skinned barely clothed women with the lower body of a deer. He wondered if they were related to centaurs somehow.<br />
His eyes rested on the hotel his adventure had started in. Somehow it looked inviting and he wondered if Amber had returned yet.<br />
&quot;You slept in that dinky hotel there?&quot; She asked.<br />
He hadn&#39;t realized he was staring. &quot;Yes. It really wasn&#39;t bad, magical mishaps not withstanding.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t but I&#39;ll show you a better one now that you have money.&quot; She said smiling. She started walking to across the open square.<br />
&quot;Wait, let&#39;s go and check if the witch has returned yet. She was a frequent visitor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine by me. Anyway Andrea figured it was weird that they didn&#39;t have Minotaur milk. It&#39;s hard to get, but not exactly rare. Usually the mage guild has a supply.&quot;<br />
Alec felt his heart rate speeding up. He didn&#39;t like where this was going.<br />
&quot;The guild wasn&#39;t able to give all the details. But apparently they actually did have a supply. However apparently the Minotaurs closed their borders.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Take it easy, they didn&#39;t lie. They&#39;ve rationed all milk for emergencies and your sex change doesn&#39;t fall under emergencies so the doctor was obligated to tell you to go get your own.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck that. Shouldn&#39;t they just help me if I throw money at them?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not how it works. While you do pay, they also have a duty to the larger community.&quot;<br />
They stood before the hotel&#39;s open doors. &quot;Go ask if your &#39;witch&#39; is back yet. I&#39;ll wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec returned to the waiting Vivian. &quot;Not there?&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think she would be yet. But it was worth a shot. Okay, so what&#39;s the deal with the Minotaurs closing borders?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what Andrea has gone to find out for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Should we head to the guild and meet with her?&quot;<br />
&quot;I figured we&#39;d take this opportunity and go shopping with you. Girls like it when a guy throws his money around you know.&quot; she winked.<br />
&quot;Stop that, you&#39;re probably underage now. But fine, let&#39;s go shopping. Are we going to get horses?&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to get you some decent equipment first and then we&#39;ll see about transportation.&quot;<br />
She led the pair through the narrow streets and passed the store Alec originally went shopping. &quot;We&#39;re not going in there?&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s good, but I know a better one.&quot;<br />
<br />
They rounded the corner and ended up next to a building. A crooked store sign denoted &quot;ye old armory&quot;. It&#39;s sturdy looking dark wooden doors didn&#39;t look very inviting.<br />
He vaguely remembered seeing it on his first rounds, but thinking it wasn&#39;t for him. I mean who would even take a name like that seriously.<br />
Vivian however led him inside. The inside somehow seemed much larger than the outside, yet was still filled to the brim with weapons, armor and various appliances of which Alec had no idea what they were supposed to be.<br />
&quot;Vivian!&quot; A tall and slender man approached, dressed in an immaculate red tweed suit. &quot;You look younger every time I see you.&quot;<br />
He seemed to be nearly dancing through his store as he approached. His fluid moments and his soft over familiar speech sent Alec&#39;s neckhairs upright.<br />
&quot;Morning Jerry, we need some equipment for my friend here. He has money, some crappy stuff and no clue what he&#39;s doing. Help him out, but no swindling. I&#39;ll be right here next to him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Swindling? Why, I&#39;m hurt.&quot; Jerry said as he inspected Alec from head to toe. &quot;Where&#39;d you find this guy then?&quot; <br />
&quot;The guild. We finished an S rank mission together.&quot; Alec said with pride.<br />
Jerry looked taken aback and looked Alec over again. &quot;Really? Fine, give me your card.&quot;<br />
Alec looked at Vivian who nodded.<br />
Jerry ran the card and his face seemed to light up. <br />
&quot;I also have this.&quot; Alec held up the bag of coins.<br />
&quot;Put that dirty thing away. This is should be plenty. Please hand over your gear, take off your shirt and let&#39;s get you outfitted.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man went through his shop like a whirlwind. Stuff of various materials was pulled out from cabinets, shelfs and seemingly out of the guys ass as he tried them on. Pants, shirts, armor to big and bulky for him to even move in. <br />
Large swords, whips, bows, axes there seemed to be no end to the stuff this store had. Yet all the while Alec had just one thought. &quot;I hope I don&#39;t have to take off my pants.&quot;<br />
At the end of the session Alec they settled on some light metal chainmail. Alex remembered reading about how heavy they were supposed to be, but this one barely seemed to weight more than the shirt he wore on top of it.<br />
Based on Vivian&#39;s pointers Jerry had exchanged the sword he&#39;d bought for himself for a new more straight forward sword as long as his upper arm. A bright red gemstone was set in the hilt. Jerry also produced a belt that magically held a limited supply of throwing knives.<br />
Jerry whirled around him taking some seemingly random measurements. Most didn&#39;t bother him, but the way he got close to his crotch made him feel uncomfortable. A light accidental brush was enough to make him throw a look.<br />
Either oblivious or just plain ignoring him Jerry just continued unabated. Alec received some extra guards for his crotch, shins and arms and after fitting them on, he felt ready to kick some ass. <br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s it. If you&#39;re satisfied I&#39;ll charge your card.&quot; <br />
Alec nodded as he admired the gold trimming on his arm guards. <br />
&quot;Are you done getting wet over yourself? Because then we can go and find Andrea.&quot;</p>
