<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that night Genius Woman and female Gavon were dressed in sexy uniforms for tonight&#39;s game: a black leather one piece(think black canary) with fishnet stockings with black 6 inch high heels. The top pinched the women&#39;s waists into hour glass figures and pushed up their plump cleavage, black choakers with bow ties were tied around their necks. Each woman had dainty white gloves with detached shirt cuffs and their faces were caked in makeup that made them look like hookers. Genius Woman&#39;s hair had been dyed back to its original black color and was pulled into two pigtails tied with black bows while female Gavon&#39;s short blonde hair was curled with a black hair band that had a black bow on it.<br />
Amanda Mars admired the two dressed up as sexy, seductive waitresses. To think that these two women were once the most brilliant minds on the planet brought a slight smile to the wicked woman&#39;s beautiful face. She herself was dressed up for this occasion as well: decked out in a red sequined, backless dress that had a slit that started mid thigh. The dress&#39;s neckline plummeted down her ample chest, showing off her buxom breasts and stopped inches above her taunt belly.<br />
Her luscious brown hair was tied tightly in a fancy updo, she wore gleaming diamond earrings and a large diamond embroided gold necklace. Her face was made up and enhanced her stunning beauty.<br />
Soon the guests arrived, the criminals were dolled up in fancy, expensive clothes unlike their usual armor or costumes. Gabriella Claw aka The Lioness dressed up in an extravagant royal blue tuxedo with beautiful gold patterns, the pure white shirt underneath was frilly and had a black bow tightly around her neck. Matching black leather business shoes that looked expensive were tied to her feet. Gabriella&#39;s dark brown face was done up in fabulous makeup &#128132; and her blonde hair, that had reddish-orange tips, was in a neat bun on top of her head, she also had blue jem earrings.<br />
Amanda had never seen Gabriella so made up before! She was after all very  dykeish, that was probably why she opted for a nice tuxedo instead of an elegant dress.<br />
&quot;Miss Claw, you look astonishing! Did you dress yourself? Or was it your lovely friend?&quot; Amanda said and hinted at the cute blonde wrapped in the African American&#39;s arms.<br />
The blonde&#39;s hair was long and curly with smooth pale skin and makeup that highlighted her feminine features. She was squeezed into a shiny white dress with matching 4 inch high heels, she accessorized with big pearl earrings on small silver chains and a pretty pearl necklace, the young woman was clutching a dazzling white hand purse. <br />
&quot;Girlfriend actually.&quot; She said in a sweet voice as she pulled Gabriella&#39;s face close to hers,<br />
&quot;My widdle poodie-tat sure looks dashing in this suit.&quot; She continued as she kissed the woman and ran her hand on the fine fabric of the tuxedo.<br />
&quot;Well the game starts soon so please head in and have something to drink.&quot; Mars ushered the two lovebirds inside.<br />
Then there was another person she never thought she&#39;d see in formal wear: Jessica Pierce aka FireMaiden. She was 18, she had black hair that was normally in a spiked bob but was now combed and jelled neatly behind her ears, she had on a simple, flowy burgundy dress that stopped just above her knees with dark red flats and dark leggings. The girl had various tattoos on her light skin and dark black eye makeup with red lipstick. Her eyes were fire red(no pun intended) and looked like she&#39;s been crying, her fingernails that were normally painted black were painted red. The only jewelry she wore was a simple cross necklace.<br />
&quot;Ah Miss Peirce, you look better than normal, you should wear dresses more often&quot; the woman greeted her with a warm smile.<br />
&quot;Fuck off old woman, the next time I wear a dress is gonna be at your funeral after I torch your fucking house.&quot; The young girl responded as she entered, not even glancing at Amanda.<br />
&quot;Brat&quot; The woman thought to herself, &quot;that girl could use some discipline.&quot; Then the thought of bending that punk over her knee and giving her a much needed spanking almost turned Amanda on, bending and manipulating others brought her amusement.<br />
Then came ShadowFang aka Wanda Green, well Wanda wasn&#39;t actually ShadowFang. She was the host to a horrible demonic being, the entity was permenately attached to the 13 year old. Wanda was dressed in a frilly white dress with a lacy collar and a big bow tied around her waist, she had white stockings and white flats that had little bows in them. Her shoulder length blonde hair was tied into a tight ponytail with a white bow.<br />
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t expect you to show up&quot; the brunette admitted.<br />
The girl&#39;s eyes were pure black with dark smoke emanating from them, that means the demon was in control. When the little girl&#39;s bright blue eyes replaced the menacing demon&#39;s Wanda was in control.<br />
&quot;You called, we came. You helped us before.&quot; She/it said in the voice of a little girl and that of a dark ominous voice at the same time.<br />
The possessed girl walked through the door.<br />
The next guest was Rudolph &quot;Rudie&quot; Wimsy aka The Jester, she was Black Lynx&#39;s arch nemesis. <br />
The white faced woman was wearing a white frilly dress shirt with a purple bow tie, the shirt was tucked into a dark pink Bermuda shorts with a purple belt. A matching dark pink suit jacket that had puffy shoulders was buttoned over the shirt and had a lime green flower on the chest. On the woman&#39;s legs were purple knee socks and pink boat shoes. The Jester&#39;s face was white with bright red lipstick framing her wide trademark smile, she had lime green eyes and curly blue hair that was permed.<br />
&quot;Welcome Miss Wimsy, its good to see you.&quot; Amanda spoke and tried to maintain her smile.<br />
&quot;Thank you my dear hostess! And you can call me Jester! No need to be all formal!&quot; The 26 year old woman announced happily and walked inside.<br />
The last guest to show up was Fiona White aka Missus Cold, she was inside her armored exosuit that kept her body at sub-zero temperatures.(she&#39;s like mister freeze,look it up if you don&#39;t know) Fiona was in an accident involving cryogenics, she had frozen her wife, Rabecca, until she could find a cure for her rare illness.<br />
Missus Cold wasn&#39;t one for formalities so Amanda quickly let her in.<br />
After everyone sat at the large, grand poker table, they began.<br />
