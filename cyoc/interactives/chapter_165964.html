<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a wave of the Eris’s hand, the teenaged surfers’ swimsuits instantly vanished. The teens were stunned at first, but kept facing at their goddess, despite their blushes.  <br />
<br />
On the floor, the plastic surfboards were mystically raised up into the air. With a swift motion, each board swung towards the teens; so fast the teens barely even flinched. <br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t strike their heads. Instead, the boards immediately dissolved into a white, glue-like liquid that covered each teenager from head to toe. It quickly spread into their orifices and their insides, covering every bit of flesh on their bodies. <br />
<br />
The liquid smoothed on their skin, and the teens opened their eyes (which were still human). When they looked down, they found their bodies resembled pure-white, porcelain statues.  <br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” said one of the guys, who checked out his hairless crotch. All the hair on the teen’s bodies had vanished, leaving them completely bald. The two girls of the group felt their breasts, and found their nipples were still there. <br />
<br />
<i>“Perhaps my followers would like to see my handiwork!”</i>, said Eris. <i>“The four of you, look towards your audience.”</i><br />
<br />
The four teens turned around, and faced the marveled crowd who were also waiting to be transformed. The teens were still somewhat embarrassed by their nakedness, but they tried to smile.<br />
<br />
<i>“Now….take a step back.”</i><br />
<br />
They did. Only to surprisingly hit a marble wall that the Goddess had quietly conjured from the temple floor. Eris giggled. <br />
<br />
<i>“Why don’t you take a seat?”</i><br />
<br />
The teens weren’t sure what she meant, but then they found their bodies suddenly flowing in, like the wall was just a block of wet sand. Carefully, they crouched their bodies down, like they were sitting on chairs.  <br />
<br />
The wall solidified, leaving them stuck in the wall in this position. To their alarm, their arms and legs immediately started withering away. <br />
<br />
“W-wait! Y-y-you said it’s going to be ocean related!”, one of the other teen girls cried out, as her hands and feet melted into lumps.<br />
<br />
<i>“I said it would be a form of water,”</i> said Eris, who still sat on her makeshift throne.  <i>“Are you not pleased with my gift?”</i><br />
<br />
“I-I’m happy, my Goddess!”, the girl quickly replied back. “You can turn us into anything you want.”<br />
<br />
Similar ‘yeahs’ came from the other teens, even as they were nervous of their changes. <br />
<br />
<i>“Very well then.”</i><br />
<br />
While their limbs fully absorbed into the teen’s torsos, the teenagers&#39; heads sank downwards, with their necks disappearing. A metal pipe grew out from the wall, right underneath their bodies. Arching upwards in a 90 degree angle, they plugged into each of their anuses. The teenagers yelped in shock, then they began moaning as if they had dildoes inside of them.  <br />
<br />
Eris leaned forward on her seat. Being a Goddess with unnatural powers, she didn’t have to see the kids to know what they looked like now.  <br />
<br />
<i>“Enjoying yourselves?”</i><br />
<br />
“We’re happy, my goddess!”, the teen girls and boys said in unison, taking in the pleasure of the pipe in their rears. Their heads have almost completely absorbed into their torsos, leaving their faces on their chests. Their privates and nipples smoothed over till they no longer existed, while the girls also found their breasts flattening. Meanwhile, a second metal pipe grew out from the top center of their bodies, and plunged its other end onto the wall. <br />
<br />
The teens looked less like humans, and more like vaguely-rectangular blocks with human faces. For any onlooker, it seemed so obvious what they were about to become. <br />
<br />
<i>“Open your mouths for your goddess.”</i><br />
<br />
The teens obeyed. When they opened, their lower jaws were immediately pulled at by invisible hands, stretching them so far down it covered their entire torsos. <br />
<br />
“Uuuuuuuugh”, the teens moaned, as the bottom jaws reached where their privates used to be, and jutted forward. Their teeth and tongue had merged with the sides of their now-enormous mouths, leaving only their throats visible. Though difficult for the onlookers to see, the opening of their throats had migrated downwards; right over where the pipe had invaded the teen’s rears. They became a circular hole with a little plastic grate on top. <br />
<br />
The teens mouths were stuck like this. Before they could try moaning, a stream of water began flowing from new holes atop their mouths; falling down the backside of their mouths like a gentle waterfall, and into their throats. The teens gurgled pleasingly.<br />
<br />
Eris had left her seat, and stepped (with a slight ground-quake with every step) over to the front the altar.<br />
<br />
<i>“A form of water, as requested.”</i>, said Eris, looking over the newly created wall urinals. <br />
<br />
The teens tried to speak, but all they could manage were wet “glug”s. Their eyes (the only moving parts of their body left) looked adoringly at their wonderful goddess. <br />
<br />
<i>“You are welcome.” </i><br />
<br />
With a wave of Eris’s hand, the urinals and their shared wall seemed to ‘phase away’ from the stage. Though Eris’s worshippers could still see them, it was now through a large circular portal.<br />
<br />
The teenaged urinals found themselves in a bathroom. They couldn’t see the portal, or any sign of the temple, the onlookers or their beloved goddess. They were alone. <br />
<br />
Oddly, the teens’ visions were watery and distorted, and they realized their eyes had somehow teleported to their own mouths, with water flowing right over them. Their eyes have also merged together in the center, and were nothing but a round, glassy bump right above their throats. <br />
<br />
And then there was a taste. In the teens’ lower jaws sat a urinal cake. The flowery flavor mixed with the water pouring down their mouths, spreading around their jaw in a shallow pool before swirling down their gullets. <br />
<br />
The teen urinals tried to speak out, but they couldn’t even gurgle anymore. Nor do they even remember which teen was where. Whatever presence they felt of each other, it was just the flowing of water, and a feeling of comfy satisfaction.<br />
<br />
A door opened somewhere, and four men walked into view. The teens couldn’t make out their faces, but they saw the men were wearing only tight, bulging swimshorts. They took their places in front of each transformed teen, and pulled down their speedos; letting their cocks flop out. <br />
<br />
Streams of piss splattered into their mouths, and upon their eyes. <br />
<br />
The teens almost moaned. Their ‘mouths’ had become so sensitive, the pee hitting it felt like someone tickling their genitals. And whenever it hit their eyes, it was like someone touching their clitorises (or for the boys, prodding into their urethras). <br />
<br />
As they took in the heavenly liquid, their human memories began to slip. School, surfing, families and homework were now just faint concepts. Names and gender? Who needs those? All that mattered was water; flowing over them, splashing on them, going into their lower pipes, foul and flowery flavored, all for the rest of their lives. It was a blissful existence.  <br />
<br />
The four urinals felt each other’s happiness. With the men’s pee still pouring in, they drank up with delight. <br />
<br />
-0-0-<br />
<br />
Back at the beach, Eris’s worshippers watched through the portal as the men emptied their bladders into the urinals. Eris was back in her seat. <br />
<br />
<i>“Look at them, my followers,”</i> said the goddess. <i>“See how satisfied they are with their new forms!. What new purpose they have in their lives!”</i><br />
<br />
Her worshippers agreed. Many of them were even more excited for what their Goddess has in store for them. Deciding it was time to continue, Eris waved her hand, and the portal vanished; leaving the wall urinals to whatever pissy future lay before them. <br />
<br />
<i>“Now, who is next?”</i></p>
