<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kathy and her staff do their best to maintain Rick condition as stable as they can, but they can&#39;t ignore the chance that Rick cell would begin to decay by any minutes or so and still check for any change in the cell. Meanwhile, Frank was just few mile away from the police station to retrieve Diane and soon after quickly bring her to the Hospital; However the situation has now become much difficult, now that he was stuck right in the middle of a traffic jam. As for Rick, he can only lay on the table, his mind now feeling hazy due to his transformation, as more fur now appear on his legs and arm, and could even feel his spine beginning to stretch. <br />
<br />
Tears were falling from Rick face, but it wasn&#39;t due to the transformation, but something worse; what if he doesn&#39;t become a woman? He believe that if he come a were-cat, he could finally be what he always believe he was in the inside, but from the nurse had told him, he could be just becoming a simple male were. If that was true, then that mean everything that he did and went through was for nothing, that his only opinion would be o get surgery to become a woman, but that isn&#39;t what he want. Even if the surgery goes well,  he would never be 100% female, he would still has his &quot;boys&quot; and never be able to experience the gift of making life, and it hard for transgender to even get into relationship if he still has his male bits. Everyone had being distance or cruel for him when he wanted to be a woman, even his parents were ashamed by this and kick him out from his home, yet even so he continue his search for a way to become female. If reality was this cruel, taking away the only thing he ever dream of being, then he simple want to die then to face the fact he can never be a woman.<br />
<br />
Just outside of the hospital, a giant figure stand on top of a tree inside the woods, his face shrouded in darkness as he began jump down from one tree branch to another and as he got closer to the ground, his body began to shrink down, his fur began to fall off till he was human again. The mysterious figure pull from his bag that he carry with a spare of clothing (jean, shirt, shoe, wallet, etc.) and began changing till he was fully dress. The stranger slowly precede to the hospital with caution, as if not wanted to be seen, slowly making his way to the front of the building. As he got closer, his appearance is that of someone around the age of 40&#39;s or more, his skin is pale, and he look like he was doing athletic works for a few years. Just near the front entrance of the building was another dark figure hold a small bag in his hand, standing a few feet away from the door, yet was attempting to not be seen by the camera. This figure was much older than the other stranger (around 50 to 60), his body didn&#39;t had much muscular tone, but isn&#39;t as thin either, and wearing glasses. <br />
<br />
The athletic figure move closer to the man and speak quietly. &quot;So do you have it?&quot; The man with the glasses nearly jump out from the surprise, but quickly calm down when he saw who was behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, god dammit, you nearly gave me a heart attack! What took you so long? If you weren&#39;t here by the next few minutes, I was going to leave you and get out of here.&quot; The stranger, now known as Andrew, try to calm him down, but at the same time attempt to make him be quiet. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Henry, it was a challenge for me to travel from the ranch all the way to here. Anyway, do you have it with you?&quot; The man call Henry let out a sign from Andrew question, but soon he pull out from his bag which contain a syringe with a strange liquid in it, a lists of were species and genders, and even information about the patient know as Rick Plunkett.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I brought all my research with me. But Andrew, I&#39;m taking this risk because I thought it was important and also to return that debt he help me out, but why on earth are we saving this patient that we have never met or even know about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor, I know this is strange and it even hard for to say this, but do you remember about the dream I told you about?&quot; Henry nearly let out a growl of annoyance and whisper (hear we go again) before continue to listen to Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was weeks ago I had a dream of this woman; this beautiful, were-cheetah woman who I was meant to be met and fall in love with. I look for her all over Moon Lake, but I couldn&#39;t find anyone with that exactly detail or appearance of that woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That because it was a dream!&quot; Henry yell in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was true, until I found her... or rather him. Once I saw him, I had that dream again, only now that the woman I was in love was this person call Rick. I was rather disturb by this, but I found out that he wanted to be a woman and even tried to become a were-cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But no male has ever become a female were-cat; it could kill them before they could even finish the transformation. However, This rick has a unique genetic condition, having a XXY Chromosomes which is rare to find in a human. However, even with this, it isn&#39;t enough to become what he want, and the only chance he would survive is to become a first Male were-cheetah and then maybe go through therapy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I have a feeling that he wouldn&#39;t be happy to go through that, so I had to contact you because you have been studying the genders and transformation of were&#39;s and once found a way it was possible to transform into a completely different gender were.&quot; Henry look into his bag with a rather heartache and sadness.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, I spend years figuring out the changes of the body going from man to beast, but also trying to understand why do we can or cannot change base of our genders, and had decided to see if it is possible to find a method to also change gender as well during the transformation. After many years of hard work and struggle, I finally found one method that could change gender. However, soon all of my funds were cancel, my research trash and eventually was kick out all because they thought that my research was ridiculous. Before they destroy my research, I was able to get my remain research&#39;s, formula and equipment&#39;s  before they could finish the rest and then I was on the run from the law every since.&quot; He look back at Andrew with concern before look back at the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do understand that you are making me go to the one place I should never be? Not only you are risking my life, but also your as well! If they find you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor, I know the risks and dangers of this, but I must do this. He is suffering and I want to help him be what he was destiny to be. So will you help me?&quot; The former doctor try argue back, but he couldn&#39;t find the will to go against someone who was in love, plus he did own him a favor.<br />
<br />
&quot;*sign* All right, you win. Let just get in before anyone finds out were here. I have already, um, &quot;borrowed&quot; the control of the camera system just before you arrive and have place it in a loop. We have but only 15 minutes before the securities notice something off with the systems and fix it.&quot;</p>
