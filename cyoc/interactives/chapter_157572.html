<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chriss thought who he could potentially possess and why, there was Jacob Matyon  (his bully) that he could take revenge on. There was his crush, Phoebe, that he could possess to finally see what was under that tight T-shirt, or even possess one of teachers to give himself better grades! <br />
<br />
All of that for...Chris hadn&#39;t even asked how much the ring was, “uh...sorry to keep you waiting, how much for the ring?” the old man looked at Chris with a mischievous grin and a twinkle in his eye, “since your my first ever customer, I&#39;ll let you have it for free” he said in his mysterious voice. Chris couldn&#39;t believe it, potential power over anyone was all he ever wanted and now his wish was coming true!<br />
<br />
“Thanks Mr....what&#39;s your name?” Chris asked the old man who smiles and says “my name does not matter, however I will give you two words to remember me by: no refunds” and with that Chris found himself outside an old abandoned workshop that lookef as if no one had used it for 20 years. “Huh, weird” Chris said as he looked down to see the ring still in his hands, “I&#39;m gonna put you to good use” he said with a slight chuckle as he started walking the rest of the way home.<br />
<br />
However, soon a car pulled up on the side of the round and when the window rolled down he saw Michelle Ferry, his best friend&#39;s mom. “Hey Chris! How was Josh today?” she kindly asked through the passenger seat window, “he was cool Mrs. Ferry, had a few laughs with Josh (his best friend)”.  She nods in acceptance and asks with a hint of worry, “do you want a ride home? It looks like its about to storm” he shakes his head and says “nah I can make it home by myself, thanks though” she doesn&#39;t look so sure but nods anyway and says, “well be safe, Chris” and rolls up the window as she begins to drive away.<br />
<br />
As he watches her car drive away he looks at the ring in his head and smirks, “might as well test it out” he says as he slips the ring down his finger and thought of Michelle Ferry before clicking his fingers and suddenly his whole body including his clothes and other belongings became transparent and began to float. “Wow! that&#39;s cool” just as he begins to look at his new ghostly form it zips him all the way into the body of Michelle Ferry, suddenly he&#39;s staring at a stop light with two manicured hands held tightly to a stirring wheel. <br />
<br />
“Woah! It worked!” he said in her voice with a tone of surprise as he let go of the wheel and felt his new boobs, “ooh kinda soft...and sensitive” he said with a slight giggle as he notices the light had turned green. “hmm lets go home, I&#39;m sure my little baby is very tired from sitting on his ass and playing on the PS4 all day he he” as he makes his way towards the Ferry household. Soon he makes it to the house and parks the car in the driveway, “ahhh perfect landing, finally I can pay attention to these girls now” Chris says as he  lifts up the blue blouse Mrs. Ferry had on to reveal a matching blue bra holding back her tits, “hmm maybe not now though, time to mess with Josh” he says as he straightens out the blouse and steps out into the windy yard, a storm was definitely coming.<br />
<br />
He uses his new purse to get the house keys and unlocks the door causing it to swing open due to the wind, “damnit! Come on” he says in frustration as he manages to grab the handle and pull it shut. “Whew, that&#39;s my exercise for the day, now where the fuck is josh?” he says to himself as he places the purse down on a small table and starts to walk upstairs, carefully trying not to fall down due to her heels, he finds him in his room still playing COD from earlier. “Heh he has no idea what I&#39;m about to do” Chris says quietly with a smirk as he bursts open the door and shouts at the top of of his lungs so everyone in voice chat can hear him “DO I HAVE TO SAY IT A FIFTH TIME JOSHUA FERRY? GO DOWNSTAIRS NOW!!!” Josh immediately jumps in surprise and you can hear laughing from the headphones as he turns off the PS4 and says, “sorry mom, didn&#39;t hear you” you barely maintain your angered face as he heads past you downstairs.<br />
<br />
Chris kicks off the heels before following him since he wasn&#39;t going through that pain again, when he reaches the downstairs hallway where Josh is standing you look at him with glares and say, “hah got you good, man” and burst out laughing. “Wait what?” Josh says with a confused expression as Chris continues busting his gut over what just happened, “ohhh that was gooood, well I guess I should explain” Chris then explains how he&#39;s actually not his mother but his best friend possessing her and how it came to be. He&#39;s sceptical at first but soon starts to believe him as the story progresses until, like Chris, he was excited about the ring as well “Bro you could even be fucking heather and let me screw her!” (Josh&#39;s crush was a senior named Heather Mony who was way out of his league), “I mean this would be the only chance you&#39;d have of screwing her so Fuck yeah” Chris encouraged.</p>
