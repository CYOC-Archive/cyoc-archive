<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Davids POV <br />
<br />
Around 7:30 the medical team came in a final time and disconnected the IVs and catheters. The patients were unaware do to Sally sedating them by stimulating and limiting various controls with the body.<br />
<br />
At 8am my eyes snapped open, which was unusual because I tend to be more of a lingering in semi-consciousness for 30 minutes, kind of a person. I brought myself to a sitting position and felt heavy and reasoned my muscles must still be tired from last night, but thankfully they aren&#39;t sore. <br />
<br />
I stood up nearly loosing my balance, maybe I&#39;m really still tired but dont realize it? I lumbered over to the bathroom needing to pee like I just chugged water all night. the floor almost felt like it was squishier than last night. like it was giving more under my weight. but that&#39;s absurd... buildings don&#39;t just loose structural integrity over night without something like a fire or earthquake. <br />
<br />
I went into the attached bathroom, turned on the light immediately squinting, and bee lined to the toilet, Normally I would stand but the pressure I felt made me question if I would be able to keep the stream steady. I didn&#39;t want to piss all over so I just sat down.<br />
<br />
once finished I washed my hands and caught sight of something strange in the mirror looking up I saw a hair less man staring at me. I yelled and jumped back.<br />
<br />
When he did the same, at the same time, I realized why I felt so off and immediately began having a panic attack on the bathroom floor. After having a reaction that would be considered of the perfectly appropriate strength given the situation, I cautiously worked my way up and looked at myself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck&quot; escaped my lips but it wasn&#39;t my voice. well I guess it is my voice now, but it was a lot deeper than my usual voice. This nearly had me panicking again. I calmed myself and took stock. I am taller. I am bald, entirely... no hair on the head, eyebrows,  or armpits. I realized I needed to check my crotch but I can only handle so much at once. <br />
<br />
My face looked leaner, my jaw squarer, I looked almost like a 20 year old who decided to shave everything off, which made me look like a mannequin modeling a hospital gown. My exposed arms showed me that my biceps were large, larger than their engorged state last night. and that was what I could see with the gown on... <br />
<br />
So I threw caution to the wind and removed the gown letting it fall to the floor. I look like a model. I&#39;m lean, ripped. and muscular, No pubic hair, but my cock is bigger than yesterday so that&#39;s good.<br />
<br />
 I rooted around the room and found some t-shirts and shorts of various sizes, out of habit I grabbed a medium shirt as I had just upgraded from smalls... apparently I have just upgraded to larges...<br />
<br />
Soon someone came to my room and we started activities at 9. Breakfast was interesting, My dad was easy to pick out. I motioned him to come over, because I had just put a bite of food in my mouth. <br />
<br />
It was weird seeing him without his striking salt and pepper hair. stubble, and body hair. I am sure he thought the same about me not having my light brown hair. I got my brown hair and eyes from my mom, my dad had black hair and blue eyes. <br />
<br />
As he approached the table I said, &quot;Hey Dad.&quot; My voice made him stop in is tracks and his jaw dropped, that made me laugh. &quot;Wow Dave, you sound a lot like Lucas, its eerie.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was obvious he had lost a ton of weight and he was really excited about it. He was also marveling at how good I looked and how I was almost as tall as him. He couldn&#39;t help but make a joke about how, &quot;they grow up so fast...&quot;<br />
<br />
After breakfast we did some leisurely Frisbee. The instructor said it was to help me reset my sense of balance, and the sooner I am acclimated to moving around the sooner it will feel normal and the easier it will be tomorrow. My hand eye coordination had been passable but now it was awful. I fell several times but instead of hitting bone, I had shoulder muscle to help cushion the fall which was a little easier. <br />
<br />
The light exercise continued throughout the day along with regular stretches. I had several more bottles of the black water and eventually lunch came. I seem to be much more eager than Dad to eat as I always seem to be at the table already eating by the time he comes in with his meager meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like... Woah!&quot; I heard dad say as I was chowing down on one of my allotted 7 fajitas, compared to his 1. I looked up confirming that he was staring at me. &quot;Woah&quot; I returned, He had continued to loose weight throughout the day and I noticed he had a coating of short hairs on his head. Some were white like usual, but the others were definitely brown instead of his usual black. <br />
<br />
I guessed he was shocked by the sudden hair growth. To me, growing 5 inches and gaining 40 lbs overnight is more surprising than some hair on my head. &quot;Oh, it looks like we&#39;re getting our hair back.&quot; I pat my head with a smile feeling it was there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not only that son, but it looks like you need to start shaving, and if you get that much since breakfast, you&#39;ll be able to braid it within a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt my face knowing what I&#39;ll find. I felt funny for a second but was immediately calm again, I think I&#39;m happy about my development. Though its a little difficult to tell my feelings from Sally induced feelings. It makes sense that she would keep us from freaking out about stuff, though thinking about being manipulated on such a basic and fundamental level makes me feel fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad, is my hair black? because you still have white hair but the hair with color looks brown.&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is black. I&#39;d guess that the DNA swap has changed the pigment my color cells make, but that alone wasn&#39;t able to reactivate the color cells that were already dormant. I&#39;m sure there are a few steps yet to go and one of them will restore my grays.&quot; Dad smiled at the thought. <br />
<br />
While he was talking, I looked more closely. I didn&#39;t see any evidence of him growing a beard, and looking at his arms, he didn&#39;t have any body hair like I was beginning to grow. My realization, the unstated expectation that Ill be mostly gray soon, my growth spurt, or his less dominating presence brought on another wave of fleeting emotions. I think it was a mixture of fear and excitement, maybe I was happy to think I could over power him? Emotions are easier to identify when they last more than a quarter second.<br />
<br />
Every three bites of food dad excused himself to the bathroom, I have an idea how hes been loosing weight. When he came back I noticed his watch. It was loose at breakfast, was now it was so loose it had turned itself around. &quot;Um dad, do you want me to take care of that for you?&quot; I offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, its probably not going to fit any better any time soon.&quot; he said passing it over. I placed it on my wrist surprised to find it fit me a little better than it was fitting him.. still very loose but that must mean that I actually weigh more than him. Huh...<br />
<br />
Dr Markle walked up as we were about to leave setting a cup of black coffee in down. Dad eyed it longingly as he greeted us. &quot;I see you are both coming along nicely. From the questioning yesterday we discussed food preferences, do you recall?&quot;<br />
<br />
We both nodded. &quot;Good.&quot; Dr. Markle said. &quot;There were a number of divergent preferences, and to satisfy the NDAs you both signed your taste preferences will need to be switched so you can more fully act the part. For example,  Frank you dislike strong tart flavors, David, Lemon bars are a preferred treat. Do you see how it could be a problem if something you are known to enjoy causes revulsion?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at the coffee fearfully as steam was wafting off it. &quot;Yeah?&quot; I squeaked in my manly voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to make this a fun for you to help you embrace the experience over the rest of your stay. Frank would you mind taking a sip.&quot; He quickly and happily took a gulp, &quot;Oh I missed that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you won&#39;t any longer, and please bear this in mind, You will have to trust your new senses.&quot; With that he put his hand to his ear, presumably activating his radio, &quot;They&#39;re ready, go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mouth, Nose and sinuses all suddenly started to tingle and I sneezed twice. &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;David, could you please...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh jeez.&quot; dad yelled in shock with a look of disgust on his face. &quot;What did you put in that? It&#39;s aftertaste is awful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try it David.&quot; Dr. Markle insisted.<br />
<br />
I hesitantly lifted the cup to my lips fearing both the scalding heat and the vile taste. I let the liquid fall into my mouth knowing there would be no avoiding it and was hit with a wonderful flavor and the temperature was pleasant. I immediately took another couple gulps responding to it like it was candy. &quot;Amazing&quot; I said to Dr. Markle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, and Frank, please enjoy this.&quot; he produced a small piece of lemon bar from behind his back. <br />
<br />
Dad was just as hesitant as I had been but after the first morsel hit his tongue the rest was inhaled. He himself looked surprised by his reaction looking at us sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know why I ate half the tray before the party...&quot; I said, referring to a time he had grounded me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would call this experiment a success. Good day.&quot; Dr. Markle hurriedly left as I went back to my coffee.<br />
<br />
The afternoon was filled with more questions and then another intense exercise session before dinner. I was overjoyed at my new weight limits and like yesterday, my muscles are engorged with blood. I was sure to position myself in bed nicely after the alarm went off... I am excited and curious how strong Ill be tomorrow.</p>
