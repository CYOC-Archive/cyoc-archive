<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You see the blush on Zarsh&#39;s cheeks, and as you watch her turn around you couldn’t help but stare at her more than endowed curves. &quot;What is it now?&quot; Zarsh asked now with a slightly annoyed look on her face. A small thought popped into your head that made you blush, and seeing Zarsh in a new form of beauty sent that idea you had into motion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I don’t know what you’re pla-&quot; Zarsh began to speak, but then there you were wrapping your arms around her form. One of your hands was around her waist and cupping her plump rear, and your other pulled her head into yours. You opened your mouth as you pulled her in all at once into a passionate kiss, while also lightly groping her ass.<br />
<br />
Zarsh seemed confused, the way her tits squished up against yours wasn’t natural to her, and the way you just rubbed your pelvis up against her thigh made her cheeks turn red. She didn’t seem comfortable, but she didn’t resist any of your efforts to demonstrate your feelings for her. Then you slowly pushed your tongue forward passed her lips and her eyes went wide, and she started to resist. <br />
<br />
However she slipped up and fell backwards in her humiliation and in a desperate attempt to stay standing she wrapped her arms around you. This only took you with her as the two of you fell onto the ground, Zarsh flat on her back, and you looking down at her overtop. Shock was the only expression that Zarsh seemed to be experiencing right now as she just stared into your eyes with a heavy blush. <br />
<br />
You blushed as well and said,&quot;U-Ummmm....?&quot; You waved your hand in front of her face, and there was no response. &quot;Did I break her?&quot; You thought to yourself before you started to worry, have you just committed a sort of tribal treason act?! You began to feel extremely worried until you felt Zarsh put her hand behind your head and pull your lips together once again.<br />
<br />
This time she was the one squeezing your ass, and the first to push her tongue into your mouth. You were surprised but reciprocated by slipping your tongue into her mouth past her teeth. The taste honestly wasn’t too great, she had rancid breath too, but what did you expect out of a retired warrior... warrioress?<br />
<br />
After a few seconds that honestly felt like minutes the two of you stopped and looked into each other’s eyes lovingly. Thinking that you might even go again, you closed your eyes and prepared for the whatever happened next only for Zarsh to smack you on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ack! What the he-&quot; You began then Zarsh put cuffed her hands around your snout.<br />
<br />
&quot;You! Me! My.... your tent! Now!&quot; Zarsh hissed looking aggravated, like she just forgot all of her femininity and just looked pissed off. You immediately nodded and complied, and she immediately took your hand and dragged you all the way to the chief&#39;s tent by claw.<br />
<br />
Once you were inside the large tent Zarsh marched on over to a large bed, no doubt a bed meant for her and her mate while he was male, and she dragged you over too with a death grip on your hand. &quot;Ah, Ack! Hey, easy!&quot; You cried and Zarsh turned around and glared at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you just do to me?!&quot; Zarsh asked looking extremely serious, however her seriousness was heavily outshined by her jiggling breasts and large ass.<br />
<br />
Admittedly you stared and glanced back up only to respond,&quot;E-Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was....?! Arrrgh!&quot; Zarsh hissed then stormed over to a rack of weapons and try to break a large spear over her knee only to hurt herself and stab it into the ground.<br />
<br />
You were surprised by how angry she was, but much more concerned when she walked back over to you and growled,&quot;Outside! You... you grabbed my tail, pulled me in, embraced me and groped my rear as a man would. Then as our breast were squishing you held my head against yours as your tongue... YOUR TONGUE.... went into my mouth!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You would feel threatened and afraid if it wasn’t for the cherry red blush on her face, or for the reason you brought up next. &quot;You did too, on the ground you squeezed my ass, and kissed me in the same way I did,&quot; You retorted trying to downplay what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes but you... you did that tongue thing back! It was almost like an act of passion, but you... me... we’re women!!!&quot; Zarsh screamed<br />
<br />
You then paused and said,&quot;Aaaaaand...?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And? AND?! Doesn’t that bother you?! It bothers me, and what’s worse is that... I... loved it....&quot; Zarsh paused and you watched her aggression subside, and she almost looked like her heart dropped.<br />
<br />
You then tilted your head and paused for a moment before finally asking,&quot;Zarsh... do you not understand this sort of thing? I’m bisexual,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bi.... what?! Urrrgh, start making sense already wo.... urrgh, just tell me,&quot; Zarsh groaned grasping her head with her claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zarsh... you keep going on about how you want a husband, but you never considered that I could still be your wife? Zarsh, bisexual means I’m sexually attracted to both men and women, and if you’re searching for a husband and are still passionate enough to kiss me like that, well... you’re bisexual,&quot; You replied putting your hand on Zarsh&#39;s shoulder and briefly taking a moment to brush some mud off of it.<br />
<br />
Zarsh paused and shook her head,&quot;I-I don’t.... n-no I...”<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s fine to be in denial right now, you just had two bombshells dropped on you,&quot; You exclaimed then Zarsh interrupted you,&quot;Look, whatever a bombshell is I don’t care right now, just tell me what’s wrong with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is wrong Zarsh, not with you, your body or anything!&quot; You hiss turning her head so she stared you dead in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re just in denial about your sexual preference, and the only way to overcome that is to experiment a bit. Now, you could go searching for a man, and have a mountain full of eggs, and that’s okay. All I’m saying is that the sooner that you accept this, the better... and I...&quot; Now you blushed and paused, biting your lip,&quot;I... think I might... oh how do I put this so you understand...? Might... be in love with your new... you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh’s face turned red and she shook her head again,&quot;I can’t believe what you’re saying right now,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s alright for you to stay with me if you want, you can talk to Tha-&quot; You began then Zarsh shook her head and said,&quot;Nope! Not now!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then paused and she squinted looking you dead in the eyes, trying to see if she could spot any cracks. However she crossed her arms and raised a brow at you,&quot;You’re... being honest... or you’re an incredibly deceptive woman. Dear gods, what kind of sick hell am I stuck in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s okay... if you truly don’t know I think Tharss could help you understand. At the very least I.... need help leading... in general, and you’ve been here the longest so...&quot; You muttered<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll think about it while I get new clothes, if you don’t see me in one-twelfth of a sun cycle then you can find me in some other male&#39;s tent being impregnated,&quot; Zarsh exclaimed<br />
<br />
You nodded silently to her and said,&quot;Okay, goodbye then... uh... wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh then paused and sighed,&quot;For now, at least, Chieftress,&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh then left and you were alone in her former tent with nothing but about a lifetime&#39;s odor of masculinity in the form of sweat, and musk.<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
You have no clue how much time it has been, enough time for you to clean off the spear Zarsh shoved into the ground, organize the weapons on the rack, and throw out any of Zarsh’s loincloth that she no longer needed. Now you were left with yourself in an empty tent, wearing a necklace with Zarsh’s tooth cradled between your tits. The more you thought of Zarsh’s body the more you secretly knew that you wanted her, and the more you admittedly regretted just throwing caution to the wind back there with her. At least she liked it, you think at least, and now you wait for someone, anyone to walk through the entrance to the tent.<br />
<br />
Just as you were about to leave you watched a familiar clawed hand push open the flaps of your tent and in walked Zarsh who now had a large bra, and a equally large skirt around her waist. You perked up when she returned and said,&quot;Zarsh, you’re back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Admittedly you were surprised, but Zarsh nodded and said,&quot;It took them awhile to find my size, and the first two tries they were too small, it was embarrassing.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed a bit and said,&quot;Well... you are pretty... endowed...&quot; You looked down at her breasts which still jiggled around despite her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, uh...&quot; Zarsh blushed,&quot;Anyways I... we need to talk to you,&quot; Zarsh said<br />
<br />
You then paused and asked,&quot;We...?&quot;<br />
<br />
You then watched the tent flap open, and to your surprise and worry walked in....</p>
