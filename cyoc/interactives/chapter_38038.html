<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>David opened the door to find his butler, which was even a great surprise to him, seeing as though he thought that he would be alone in the house. Since David had moved into the house a few nights ago, he has come to enjoy the company of Buzz the butler. Buzz wasn't his real name, it's just what he liked to be called since his name was Gary and he didn't like it. Buzz looked as his name sounded, to be completely honest. He was six feet tall, heavily muscular build, short and close cropped hair like an Army Sargent, medium bronzed skin wearing the typical black and white butler uniform. His voice was somewhat low, which David assumed swooned the ladies... if Buzz even took the time to be around some.</Br>
<Br>"Good day to you David!"</Br>
<Br>"Good day to you as well Buzz."</Br>
<Br>"Ahh, I see we are going for a relaxed look for work today?" He said with a smirk and a sarcastic undertone.</Br>
<Br>David rolled his eyes, not really wanting to be critiqued on what he planned to be one of his last days in the office he hated going to. "Yes Buzz, this is what I am wearing and if you want to give me any grief about it, then I will just start calling you by your real first name." Which David smirked at himself, knowing what type of reaction that would elicit from Buzz.</Br>
<Br>Buzz grimaced slightly, then glared sternly at David, then smiled knowing that David would not do it, but loved to torment him.</Br>
<Br>"David... do you plan on going into work anytime soon?"</Br>
<Br>"No, not really Buzz... why do you ask?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest sir, there are some things that I would like to share with you about the estate, but it would take some time. Perhaps over breakfast?"</Br>
<Br>David shrugged his shoulders, not really caring one way or the other about his job, as he wanted to learn about the new estate he would be living in for some time. "Sure Buzz, how about we start as we head down to the dining area?"</Br>
<Br>"That sounds like a splendid idea sir... er, uh excuse me... David. It is going to take me some time getting used to being informal with you. Your mother and father just liked sir and ma'am."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I know Buzz... but the whole sir thing is just not me. They were older for one and didn't mind the plain titles. I think it is easier to get to know one another if that boundary between work and life wasn't there."</Br>
<Br>"I do agree with you David. It is much nicer to be able to be coy and easier to become your friend like I did with your mother and father. So... about the estate, there are some things I think you should know right off the top of things."</Br>
<Br>"Oh yeah, what would that be?"</Br>
<Br>"Well in the many years the estate has been occupied, there have been many people and many things that have gone on here. A few things have happened since I have worked for your family for the fourteen years that I have. One thing is that there are many secret passages around the building. Some lead to other known about rooms in the house which are maintained, but some lead to unexplored and secret rooms in the house. There is one that I have known about for some time, but was instructed not to go down there until you started living here."</Br>
<Br>"What is so special about that room Buzz?"</Br>
<Br>"I am being honest with you now David, but I haven't the foggiest clue. Your parents said that you were the only one to know about it, besides myself, and that I was to accompany you there."</Br>
<Br>"Ok... so what else did you want to tell me?"</Br>
<Br>"I wanted to tell you about the one thing I know to have happened here when I first started. A few nights after my very first day, a strange illness befell everyone living in the estate, including myself and your parents. For some, it was taken to like a common cold or flu, but some of the people living here actually died from the sickness. No one that survived ever figured it out as it made absolutely no sense to anyone. We thought it was very strange for a few people to die where the majority were sick for three or four days. What I found out was that the room I am supposed to go with you to, was what was behind everyone getting sick. Personally I think it was some germ that mutated over time being locked up in a dank and dark portion of the house and when the seal of the room was broken, it made it's escape."</Br>
<Br>"So are you telling me that if we go to that room, there is a chance that you and I will get sick or possibly die?"</Br>
<Br>"Actually, it is the exact opposite. You see, when we were all infected, the virus or whatever it was placed a genetic marker in our DNA. The ones that survived it and had children passed it on through their blood, meaning that no one else can get sick or die from whatever it was down there. Besides that, the fact is that the room was left as it was, opened slightly because no one ever went in."</Br>
<Br>"Hmm... that sounds very interesting Buzz. I think we may have to check things out for ourselves!"</Br>
<Br>"Very good David! What shall we do first, take a look at that room or grab some breakfast?"</Br></p>
