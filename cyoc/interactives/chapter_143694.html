<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two new anthro women got off of one another and stepped out of their ruined tent. The only thing remaining of Jess’ humanity were her panties, still barely holding on. She removed them, dropping them on the ground there, and the two walked over to Tim’s tent. Jess, now part cat, moved silently across the site, but while Ami had been lucky before, her big rabbit feet made her clumsy and on the way she accidentally stepped on a branch, causing it to crack. The noise itself wasn’t enough to wake the drunk Tim, but it was able to scare a bat hanging in a nearby tree enough that it took off. The startling nature of its awakening left it disoriented and in a swift movement it flew straight into the site of Tim’s tent, causing quite the ruckus, an then it flew away. The two girls listened as Tim was clearly now awake from that debacle and the girls took off to hide before he came out and saw. Tim sat up groggily and rubbed his eyes. He felt parched and needed a drink to combat the effects of his somewhat still drunk somewhat hungover illness. He stood up and opened the door to his tent, stepping out in a t-shirt and boxers. He went over to their picnic table where the water canteen was and tried to fill his hands for a drink. After getting one, and requiring a lot of effort, he turned back and took a look at the still burning file pit. There were no longer any flames but there were still coals burning in it. He took the poker and shuffled the logs around, hoping to stir up a bit more heat.<br />
Tim looked over at the girls tent but was worried when he noticed the wide tear in the side. He went over and took a peek inside. “Ami? Jess?” he asked, but received no response. He took another step closer trying to get a better look, hoping they weren’t naked or anything, and he stepped on something that felt strange. He looked down but didn’t have enough light to make out exactly what it was, it just looked like a triangle. He reached down and picked it up, feeling it was fabric, holding it closer to his still slightly groggy eyes he realized what it was, they were panties.<br />
Tim was now very worried, scared that some sexual psychopath had kidnapped them and ran off. He Ducked back into his tent and scrambled to find his flash light, hoping that if he could see he might be able to make better sense of the situation, but he had a lot of trouble finding it. When he eventually did, he turned it on, pointed at the ground. He stood up to go out, shone it towards the door, and immediately flew backwards, screaming, as he saw a black figure with slitted green eyes staring back at him. The flashlight went flying and landed on the other side of the tent, leaving only ambient light behind, just enough that Tim could now see there were tow figures, one was next to impossible to see, most likely the black one, the other one seemed lighter and he could make out a few details.<br />
“Who the hell are you two? And what did you do with my friends?!” he asked.<br />
“It’s us silly,” Ami replied.<br />
“Ami? Why the hell did you guys scare me like that? What the hell happened to your tent? Why is there underwear on the ground…” Tim fired off a series of questions while he lay on the ground, still looking up at the girls until the came closer, very close, and he stopped. “What are you doing?”<br />
“Like, why all the questions Timmy, why not just enjoy the moment and junk,” Jess cooed.<br />
“What? You scared the shit out of me.”<br />
“Yeah but, now we really wanna make it up to you.” Ami said with a seductive tone.<br />
Tim was very caught off guard by this. He had been drunk before and so had Ami but for her to be acting like this, he figured one of them had to be very, very drunk. “What the hell’s gotten into you Ami?”<br />
“I did,” Jess smirked.<br />
“And it felt so good,” Ami added.<br />
“Okay, I’m dreaming. I’m a horny drunk teenager, and I’m dreaming.” Tim said to himself.<br />
“No dreams, not yet at least, we’re like, here to make them come true,” Jess said.<br />
Tim looked up at the girls and while he still couldn’t quite make them out, he could still see that something was wrong, in particular it looked like there was something on each of their heads and something was waving around behind Jess. As his vision finally started making out their shapes Jess’ tail accidentally hit the flashlight in the corner of the tent and turned it towards them, showing Tim their full bodies. The first thing he noted was that Jess was now fully black, resembling a cat woman, while Ami was a white bunny girl. He then noticed that their bodies, beyond animalistic features, seemed more ‘full’ than before. “What the hell!?”<br />
Those three words were all that Tim got out before the two girls had pinned him down and began to make out with him. One their own he might have been able to escape been together the did a good job at holding him down. Ami was locking lips with him at the moment while Jess pinned down his side, swaying her tail around and used a free hand to trace her finger around Tim’s privates. He was panicking at the moment, not sure which was worse, that his friends were now animal freaks or that he was making out with his long-time best friend, okay that wasn’t that bad. Tim quickly fell into the kiss and before he could even understand it Ami had backed off, the girls now both sitting over him, wanting to watch the changes this time.</p>
