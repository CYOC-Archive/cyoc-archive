<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Genie wandered along, meeting people and when someone would make slight of another person and call him or her a less than becoming sort or name, the Genie would avail the name caller with a form and fate similar to that wished upon either friend or foe.<br />
<br />
Genie found this a common role for many people, thinking the worst of another human, and as much ready to damn and doom anyone to being something without honor or integrity.<br />
<br />
This continued until one day the Genie floated past a middle aged man walking through a forested park, the man talking to himself, obvious distraught with something, the Genie took time to take a listen.<br />
<br />
Upset with the portion of the world he had to reside in and living there had made a mess of his life, the man grumbled, wishing aloud that if he had a choice and chance to be something other than what he was, he would be in form as something to give and cause such discord, if seen by people they would run and seek shelter.<br />
<br />
Stepping out from behind a massive old Oak tree, the Genie looked Ken in the face, eyes meeting as silence then seemed louder than of what Ken rambled a moment before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it that you would rather be as if not born, or created in such a way as to draw friends and foes to some dastardly fate?&quot; The Genie bluntly asked Ken, both standing one before the other, and Ken having a facial expression as one astonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, well, yes, if you wish to butt in and ask me what I would want and to be, then it is like so!<br />
<br />
Instead of this aging partially bald man standing here, a pudgy diabetic ailing with complications from an auto accident and what happened after; if asked and offered I would wish to be as my own worst nightmare for those who put me down to where I am!&quot; Ken rambled, he thinking of his times when in a dreamy fantasy mindset he listening to classical music and having time to wish he could return some hardships upon other who did the same to him, he had something in mind he would like to be as if...<br />
<br />
The Genie smiled at Ken, a grin of one seemingly reading the dark thoughts that abound in us all at times when  he are feeling low.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, how interesting, you would wish to be as some alluring female creature, part of you as a tall, slinky whore of a human form woman, well endowed to chest, but wearing outwardly the sensual allurement of being like to a satyr-woman.&quot; The Genie reading what Ken thought to say, but wanted to speak his mind in a slightly restricted fashion, as not to embarrass himself totally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, how did...well if it could be real, yes, I would become a devilish creature, partially a blend of slinky woman and much of what it is to be animalistic and as then a sexy alluring goat.<br />
<br />
Bestial in my body and as much in my lusty thoughts, alluring to all males, men or animals, a she-beast, wild for seeking my pleasures, as if nymphomaniac in desire and lusting. Seeking sensations and pleasures I would lure men to a sexual damnation equal to my own, but with their acting like me to females, they would continue to change and be then as big, buck male goats, constantly in the mindset of rut.<br />
<br />
As of women I might draw in and having them assault my body in like fashion as do the men, licking my dark damning gated lips to hell and what lies behind them, bringing upon them all the lust of passions they had till that moment not dared to think or let it be known.<br />
<br />
I want to be as a devil, doing to those who put me down to where I am now, giving them of what I feel they truly deserve. This is but part of what I would do if all were a possibility!&quot; Ken chided his dastardly dream at the Genie, totally unsuspecting this personage before him had the power to change Ken to the very essence of his being and soul into a slutty animal-woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you think of and ask is to me quite something funny. I for one, I think often of similar and often do as you would, if you could.<br />
<br />
So then,&quot; said the Genie as raising arms up and with hands cocked down at the wrists, then came a command upon Ken that his crude, rude dream shall be a truth.<br />
<br />
Awestruck, Ken stood there with his mouth open, aghast at what he saw standing before him, unbelieving that of what he had expounded could possibly become a reality.<br />
<br />
Golden rays of cursing power exploded from the ends of each finger on the hands of the Genie.<br />
<br />
Golden rays that rained down upon a nervous man. Rays that struck Ken, sinking into him to the deepest, lowest denominator, to his very atomic structure; changing a man into a woman, adding to this the sexual attributes to be alluring to evil thinking people.<br />
<br />
Ken moaned, the sound of his voice changing from a deep monotone to one of a sweet alluring voice as owned by so many devious females.<br />
<br />
What were as clothing upon Ken became instead as not a black pinstriped business suit, but being then as a shaggy coat of goat wool. Furry from head to toes, toes that with legs did rapidly rack with changing, becoming cloven hooves, long feet, heels as strong hocks, and thighs as stout muscle to send Ken running across the turf when the spirit moved her. <br />
<br />
Blue eyes turned harsh and oddly alluring, becoming brightly colored yellow rectangle iris with square pupils.<br />
<br />
Human ears became floppy fur covered oval shaped lobes, as facially Ken felt his chin narrow and nose tweaked, lips pouted and made able to suck men to their doom.<br />
<br />
Surprised at the lack of pain from the drastic changes, Ken stood watching as he changed from a male human to some bestial creature and then being like to a female.<br />
<br />
Head tiled, cocked to eye downward, Ken watched in silence as his maleness softened, melting back into his groin and leaving then the lust loving gates to the hellish poised vagina and what lay beyond it.<br />
<br />
Nervous as it all took place, Ken suddenly felt something moving, and with a half twisting turn he eyed his grown goat tail, poked up and bearing for all to see was her dark skin toned rump.<br />
<br />
Sensations began to flood into a changing brain and mind of what Ken asked to be, he feeling and finding his fantasy wish as a blunt reality for her to deal out devilish justice.<br />
<br />
Tingling sensation moved upward and downward, encompassing Ken he watched as male nipples swelled into perky tipped nipples, black, and standing out two inches as if the teats of a lust seeking goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breasts, tits, oh, oh, oh how I need now to feel them sucked!&quot; Ken woefully moaned, feeling of them with her hairy hands, and nearly slicing one nipple with the talon like claws Ken had in place of human fingernails.<br />
<br />
Goat hind legs splined apart, tail wiggling, and then feel from the wealth of strange sensations, Ken began to orgasm, juices moistening his vagina, and dripping, she turned wild eyed with wanton lust to feel the prong of some male to quell he pangs.<br />
<br />
The Genie thought this was the epedemy of many humans, they wishing that if possible the living in animalistic form was as something better and more fun than the safe, secure, and comfortable lifestyle granted to most humans.  <br />
<br />
Seeing this Satyress form swooning for someone to quell her building lusty passions, the Genie poked three fingers into a dripping vagina, shocking the hot tunnel, and making Ken to faint from the wild feelings of her getting F.....!</p>
