<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So far I&#39;d been turned into a helpless baby and been seen naked and crying by my friends, brother and my past self. They&#39;d called me cute, laughed and treated me like a baby and outwardly I was. Gone were my toned muscles, body strength and sex appeal.<br />
<br />
I remembered back to when I was travelling through the portal. I could feel  strange sensations throughout my body, like it was being warped and contorted. I felt my limbs slowly shrinking and draining of their strength. My chest grew light as my head grew heavier and I fell backwards like I was sinking, swallowed up in darkness. I thought it had all just been disorientation from the time-travel; I wish it had... <br />
<br />
I fell out of the portal. The world grew a little lighter but I couldn’t tell what was going on, something was blocking the light and I could do nothing to stop my fall as I impotently flailed my arms. Then something warm caught me and with a jolt we landed. I slowly descended to rest on much a cooler surface and then the light returned as layers of white and green were pulled away from me. Something was moving them, something big.  I tried to reach for my gun, a knife, anything but I couldn’t find them. Then the creature found me. It’s warm touch was gentle as it prodded then cupped my butt in its massive claws. Its hand seemed big enough to fit around my waist and my heart raced as I imagined how big its mouth and teeth would be. A final layer was peeled away and bright light shone in my eyes blinding me. All I saw was a vaguely humanoid shape peering down on me.<br />
<br />
“It is a baby&#39;s bottom!” I hear a bright, plucky sounding woman say and feel the giant reach underneath me and lift me into the air. I tense up automatically and brace for what is to come but I’m not even slightly prepared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you just the cutest thing,&quot;  says Maedel, my best friend, only now her face takes up my entire vision, she’s not just close, she’s gigantic. My mouth drops open but I don’t know what to say, I’m too astounded to try to decipher meaning in what she’s said. After staring at her goofy grin I start to become aware that I’m being held in her arms. I can feel her warm hands cradling me, touching my bare skin. My chest is light and I can feel the cool air over it. I move my legs, expecting to feel the fabric of my shorts or underwear but feel nothing but cool air and Maedel’s warmth on bare skin. I’m totally naked in front of Maedel!<br />
<br />
I flail about try to lift myself off of my back and start to say “What is going on?” but after only three syllables I realize my mouth is moving but my tongue and my lips don’t know what to do. I’d taken it for granted but now I just couldn’t remember how to produce the sounds I wanted. I prepared to try to speak again but rolling my tongue around my mouth I realized I couldn’t feel any teeth. Now Maedel’s smile had intensified, I’d never seen her grin so big. The way she looked down at me, grinning, it was like she was enjoying my plight. I lift my legs, to try to swing them enough to help me up but the legs I see above me aren’t mine. They’re all fat and chubby, nothing like my sporty runners thighs and calfs. I furrow my eyebrows, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe is baby trying to touch her toes?&quot; Maedel giggles, she’s still looking at me, and she just said baby, she called me a baby! Those chubby baby legs are my legs! I’m a baby!<br />
<br />
I’ve got no teeth, I can’t talk, my chest is flat and my head is heavy.<br />
<br />
Another giant obscures the light. Its another familiar face yet eerily large. It’s almost like staring into a mirror but my reflection smiles back while I worry.  <br />
<br />
&quot;If you can understand us - don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll take care of you and try to figure out what happened... It just might take a while... We&#39;re awfully busy at the moment.&quot; The other me says.<br />
<br />
She’s the younger me. She still has the long hair and bright smile of the naive girl I used to be. She can’t help. She won’t be able to do anything when shit hits the fan – just like I couldn’t at her age. That’s why I had to go back because now I had the smarts, the toughness to stand and fight… but it’s been taken away. I can’t stand or fight. <br />
<br />
My face feels hot and I’m frowning.<br />
<br />
I can’t speak. I’m not going to be able to change a thing. I can’t even warn them.<br />
<br />
My lips quiver and I can feel pressure behind my eyes.<br />
<br />
 I can’t fight, I can’t help, I’m useless! It’s not fair! <br />
<br />
The feelings surge in me and I begin to bawl like a baby and Maedel tries to comfort me.I stop momentarily as I feel another odd sensation. A bubble gently pops and little trickle begins to run through me that turns into river. I feel the warm, wetness over my legs and butt quickly start to cool. Oh Gods I just peed all over myself and Maedel!<br />
<br />
Its not right! I’m tough, my own soldiers feared me. Everyone listened to me! I don’t need anyone! I’m a hero! I’m an adult, not a child! I don’t pee myself… not ever. Not In front of Maedel. .<br />
My wailing turns to sobs and I’m handed off to my old self. She holds me tightly, pressed up against her breasts. Rubbing them in my face, showing how mature she is compared to me, the little baby that just peed herself.  <br />
<br />
I hear them arguing over who gets to hold me and reach out for Maedel. Every second in my own arms is a second I’m reminded of what I lost and I’m feeling so tired and weary and just want to stop thinking and sleep. Maedel holds me against her warm, naked breast and my eyelids droop. I’m vaguely aware of a conversation about naming me. I hear the name Hazel and can’t help but smile and laugh. “I’d always like that name” I think as I slip into slumber. <br />
<br />
I awoke to the jingle of bells off in the distance and began to panic - where I&#39;m from, where there are bells, there are usually jesters. I start to panic. I&#39;d come all this way and I couldn&#39;t even warn anyone about what was to come. I couldn&#39;t do anything! I wasn&#39;t even sure if I&#39;d be able to crawl on my own let alone walk, I could easily end up as a little play thing for the clowns, stuck in some kindergarten taught to be the perfect clown and toy for the Clown Queen. Or something worse could happen. The Clown Queen could somehow recognize me as her wayward step-daughter, I still didn&#39;t know the extent of her powers or their source so it could be possible. She would love to catch me, have me under her thumb, humiliating me in public. That&#39;s what scared me. <br />
<br />
Luckily, Maedel the giant cradling me noticed the bells too. She’s quick to take the lead and decide to head for the next town. I’m handed to the other me, Princess Sara, again and I see an already topless Maedel take off her cloak and begin fixing it underneath a giant pig that I’m sure is Princess Connie.<br />
<br />
“This should keep Hazel warm and mostly dry.” Maedel states, “It’s an elven cloak. Water only passes one way through it so even if she pees it’ll seep straight through. ”<br />
<br />
“Oh I get to carry the baby!” Connie squeals enthusiastically. My enthusiasm is non-existent. Does Maedel really intend to hang me in a cradle underneath a pig? Still, I’m glad to hear I won’t end up drenched in my own pee.<br />
<br />
“Why can’t we just carry her?” Sara asks.<br />
<br />
“Can’t you feel the air? It’s about to start raining pretty bad… Andrew and I need to be ready for a fight and… your clumsy enough when it’s dry.” Maedel shrugs. <br />
<br />
Sara was not happy about hearing the truth so bluntly. “And you’re just going to walk around topless in the rain? Is that an elven ranger thing too?”<br />
<br />
“No. Well,… yes. Its part of survival training. They stick you and a friend alone in a forest together naked and…” <br />
Sara raised an eyebrow at Maedel explanation.<br />
<br />
“I’m just still icky from baby pee. It’s not a fruity elf thing, okay?... The first thing me and my partner, Desmae did was make some clothes. Even if hers did keep falling off…” <br />
 <br />
I’m quickly loaded into the baby carrier. It’s hot, muggy and the smell is pretty bad. I’d been around Connie the pig for many years but never this close and as bad as it was I was able to quickly drift off to sleep. <br />
<br />
<br />
When I awoke I was back in Maedel’s arms, snuggled up to her now clothed chest. We’re in a tavern or inn I can hear lively music and loud conversations. The place seems huge, full of bearded giants and there massive tankards. I feel small and vulnerable. Maedel lowers me onto the table to rest me on my back and I feel a pang of fear. “Don’t put me down!”<br />
<br />
“You can cuddle in a moment. Lets just get some clothes on you first, huh?”  Maedel says, sweetly and I try to nod. I’d feel a little better with clothes on.<br />
<br />
She lies me on my back and I’m embarrassed as she lifts my legs and bum with one hand. I feel so small and she can see everything! She giggles, perhaps noticing my embarrassment and slips something beneath me. My legs are gently lowered and my now sits on my soft new clothes. They feel so nice that I imagine they’re the finest elven materials and I smile at Maedel in thanks. She lifts part of the elven cloth up between my legs and up to my belly. The material crinkles – these aren’t eleven clothes! She closes it up tightly and my legs are kept apart by the thickness of it.<br />
<br />
“There you go, snug as a bug!” Maedel said in tone reserved for babies and small children ,“Couldn’t find any elven so you get gnome disposable diapers for the time being. Now, time for your reward for being such a good little bunny while you had your diaper changed!” <br />
<br />
She pulled out a bottle of milk with a rubber nipple and before I could protest it was popped into my mouth and I began noisily sucking on the bottle, my mouth moving of its own accord. Maedel had to hold the bottle for me. It was almost as big as I was, reminding me just how small I’d gotten. Somehow I manage to down the whole thing and soon found myself held over Maedel’s shoulder, being rubbed on the back. I burped loudly and the jolt through my body moved something. I went cold, realizing that it was my bowels and with a wet fart I filled my first diaper. I had just pooped In a room full of strangers and found myself looking around worried they’d been watching, or they could smell the mess I’d made. Somehow my thumb had gotten into my mouth and I’d begun sucking profusely. As I looked around my eyes met someone else’s. They sat in the shadows in a dark corner but their mouth glittered with pearly white teeth, sharpened to points. I heard them laugh a haughty woman’s laugh. It sounded almost like she was mocking me. I shivered and finished peeing in my diaper.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, Maedel placed me on my back on the table again.<br />
<br />
“Well, poopie pants, your certainly not afraid to get messy like Sara is, huh?” she said, scrunching up her nose.<br />
<br />
By the end of the day I’d had two more equally embarrassing diaper changes. I looked but I never saw the sharp toothed woman again, though I felt her laughter. From then on it seemed every laugh from the other patrons was at my expense, like they somehow all knew I’d taken the risk of time-travelling and doomed myself to begin life anew as a baby. I’d gone from proud warrior to poopie pants and they knew.<br />
<br />
 I awoke early the following day, wet and sticky in my own mess. Sara and Maedel slept peacefully either side of me. I sat there for a time, wriggling to try to escape the soggy diaper but it just became more uncomfortable. I had to wake Maedel or I’d be stuck all sticky for hours. <br />
<br />
Reaching out as far as I could I managed to grab Maedel’s nose as she lay facing me. I tried to squeeze it hoping it would wake her but instead she rolled over onto her back. I felt an overwhelming frustration but managed to keep it together, Maedels pointy elf ear was now withn reach and I grabbed it giving it a squeeze, expecting her to wake because elf ears were particularly sensitive. Instead she softly moaned “Mmmm.”<br />
 <br />
My frustrations hit boiling point and I impotently slapped my hands against the bed, still hitting them to softly to wake the sleeping giants making me feel worse. After I began chattering and again failing to wake them my frustrations boiled over as tears that streamed down my face. Realizing how helpless I was I began crying in earnest, finally awakening my caretakers. All that for a diaper change I didn’t even want to experience in the first place.<br />
<br />
Maedel scooped me up and quickly began dealing with my messy predicament, stripping me and wiping me down as if I had no dignity at all. She seemed to have forgotten the idea that I might actually be an adult and treated me like the baby I appeared to be.<br />
<br />
Maedel went back to bed for a few hours leaving me to plan or rather imagine ideal situtions where I’d be able to show them I’m and adult. If I could just get hold of a quill and ink. Hell, if they gave me baby blocks I could try giving them a message. When the others finally awoke we went to visit a fortune teller. By now I was thoroughly sleepy from being awake imagining things and as soon as we entered the mystics dimly lit domicile I nodded off snuggled in Maedel’s arms, head between her soft bosoms. I must admit it the closeness was nice and I was sleeping more soundly than I had in years.<br />
<br />
When I woke I was acutely aware than Maedel’s bountiful breasts seemed even bigger, now they appeared bigger than my head. At first I began to worry, fearing I’d shrunk further, but upon investigation of the rest of my surrounding I came to the conclusion they’d gotten bigger. Squeezing them, they felt softer and jiggly-er.<br />
<br />
“Aww jeeze. I thought you might notice, Hazel,” Maedel looked down at me and said, <br />
“They’re really sore so I guess we’re going to have to do this.” She sighed, unbuttoning her clean tunic, “You seem interested enough.”<br />
It didn’t take long before I knew was she was talking about. In moments I was face to face with her engorged nipple and my jaw dropped. She didn’t really plan to… She did. My head was gently pressed against her boob, my open, gummy mouth latching onto her and suckling. I didn’t know how I’d be able to look Maedel in the eye if and when I get changed back. She’d already cleaned my smelly bottom and now was feeding me with her own teat! For all intents and purposes my best friend had become my mother! Greedily gulping down on her yummy milk I became aware that I was enjoying this.  The feeding, the cuddling, the peaceful sleep… I felt loved.<br />
<br />
“So… the fortune teller said you were Sara from the future. Crazy, right?” Maedel said, as if making idle conversation. With effort I manage to stop my suckling and look up at her pleasant smile which faded into a goofy look of puzzlement.  I try to say “I am,” but only mange to blow bubbles and send milk running down my cheek.<br />
<br />
“Wow… I guess we’re kind of stuck playing happy families for now.” Maedel laughs, nervously, “This would be weird if it weren’t so funny. Prissy little Princess is now a poopy little baby! I bet you’re glad to have mommy Maedel rather than your old mom though, huh? You certainly seem to enjoy mommy’s milk!”<br />
<br />
Of all the times for her to find out, why’d it have to be now? I turn my head away cheeks red with humiliation. Trust Maedel to enjoy this!<br />
 “Aww is my little Princess embarrassed? Did she make stinkies in her diapee?” I shake my head at the question but she inquisitively sticks two fingers down my diaper anyway, seeming disappointed I’d managed to go 5 minutes without wetting myself.<br />
<br />
“Listen Sara… Hazel, you are going to have get used to being babied because, well, you are one and it could be a long time before we can figure out how to change you back. I mean we don’t even know who did this to you and we’ve got a bunch of magic clowns after us. Just go with it. Think of it like... a holiday from responsibility,” and dignity, I think to myself.</p>
