<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was 30 with blonde hair and blue eyes.<br />
<br />
He and Maria had known eachother for a long time, and he had finally proposed to her.<br />
<br />
They'd been engaged for some time.<br />
<br />
Before they could get married, Maria had to go overseas on an archeological expedition in Greece.<br />
<br />
John remembered the day she left to get on the plane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please be careful over there.&quot; he said &quot;I don't want to lose you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, John.&quot; she replied, putting her left hand on his right shoulder &quot;I promise I'll be back. You'll see. We'll get married when I'm done <br />
with this job, and it will be the happiest wedding anyone has seen. I love you John.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you, Maria.&quot; he replied. <br />
<br />
The two then hugged and kissed eachother on the lips, then she got on the plan and flew off - it was the last time he saw her, or spoke with <br />
her.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Now, six months later, John was one of the soldiers trying to preserve mankind from a virus, with those infected serving the very same woman <br />
he had pledged to marry.<br />
<br />
He couldn't believe Maria, HIS Maria, was capable of doing all this to the world.<br />
<br />
He blamed the virus, for he believed she must be acting under it's influence - otherwise she would never do something like this, so he thought.<br />
<br />
Queen Maria still loved John, and she still wanted to marry him. She gave orders to all her loyal subjects not to infect him, but to bring him to <br />
her so that she could infect him herself, so he was safe - for now anyway.<br />
<br />
Today, he was on patrol through the now ruined city.<br />
<br />
With him was Rene, a 27-year-old black woman with her hair tied back in a ponytail.<br />
<br />
She had been recently assigned to be his new partner after the virus had claimed his last one, so she was more than a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't seen any of the goat-freaks all day.&quot; Rene said as they walked in an alleyway &quot;I tell you John, I've got a bad feeling in the back of my  <br />
neck about this. They're up to something - I just know it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep your cool, Rene.&quot; John told her &quot;As long as we stay level-headed about this, we're fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as they got to the end of the alleyway, a satyr jumped out at them.<br />
<br />
He had green eyes, and thick, red hair covering his whole body except for his face. He had a small goatee. He was about 27.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, good lookn'.&quot; he said to Rene &quot;I'm Greg. Do you have a name to go with that beautiful body of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Rene,&quot; she replied, pulling out her gun and pointing it at Greg &quot;and you'd better remember it, 'cause if you make one wrong move, it'll be <br />
the last thing you ever know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool your jets, beautiful.&quot; Greg said, smiling &quot;I'm here for him.&quot; he pointed at John &quot;Her Majesty, Queen Maria gave us orders to bring you to <br />
her if we found you, which I just did, and don't worry about ME transforming you - she's reserved that pleasure for herself. You coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not going anywhere with you!&quot; Rene spat at Greg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm coming.&quot; John replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; exclaimed Rene &quot;Why John? You're one of our best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This could be my chance to see her.&quot; John said to her &quot;If I could talk some sense into her, she'd call this whole thing off, and we could win <br />
this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Rene said &quot;I won't let you go with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Greg said, smiling cleverly &quot;you're going to help me take him there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I do that?&quot; Rene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you feel a small prick in the back of your neck a minuet or two ago?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; she replied &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you two were walking,&quot; Greg replied, smiling &quot;I was hiding, and I shot a dart into the back of your neck filled with the virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rene felt the back of her neck, and pulled out the now-empty dart.&quot;OH CRAP!!!&quot; she exclaimed, as her nose became a black goat's nose, her <br />
lips became black, and her upper lip split down the middle.<br />
<br />
She then tried to shoot herself, but her gun became a set of panpipes with a shoulder strap. Her ears then popped into goat ears with black <br />
hair to match the hair on her head, and freckles appeared on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry beautiful,&quot; Greg said to her, as goat horns erupted from her forehead and curled back around her ears &quot;but I can't have you wasting <br />
yourself like that. I hope you understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then turned toward John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me John.&quot; she said as her hair grew past her waist &quot;You don't have to do this. Just run - NOW!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Rene,&quot; John said as her fingernails became hard and black &quot;but if there's even the slightest chance that I can get through to her, I <br />
must take it. Afterall, I still love her. I always have, and I always will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, that's sweet.&quot; Rene said as her pupils became rectangle-shaped &quot;Her Majesty is very fortunate to have a man who loves her so much. I <br />
just wish I had a man like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can grant that wish.&quot; Greg said slyly. He took her by the hand, hugged her, and kissed her passionately on her lips. This sped up the <br />
process, and caused her to burst out of her clothes.<br />
<br />
She was now a full satyress, with thick black hair covering all but her face, stopping at the top of her neck.<br />
<br />
John followed them to a helicopter.<br />
<br />
Greg got in the driver's seat, Rene sat next to him, and John sat in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry you got dragged into this, Rene.&quot; John said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be.&quot; she said smiling &quot;Now I've got me a man of my own, and he's soo strong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind not distracting me while I'm piloting, beautiful?&quot; Greg asked with a nervous smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry cutie.&quot; Rene replied smiling &quot;I promise I'll be a good girl - for the rest of the fight anyway. Hee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
They flew all the way to Athens, Greece, where Queen Maria's place was. It was very big and ornate obviously constructed by experts.<br />
<br />
They landed at the top.<br />
<br />
They got out, and went inside the throne room on top of the building.<br />
<br />
The whole way there, Greg and Rene couldn't stop flirting with eachother, holding hands, and kissing eachother.<br />
<br />
When they got there, it was a huge room with pleasing fragrances, and soft carpets couches and pillows, and lying on the largest couch at the <br />
end of the room, in a seductive pose, was Queen Maria herself. She was wearing gold hoop earrings, gold bracelets on her arms, a gold <br />
necklace, and a leafy laurel on top of her head. As she laid there, eating grapes (and the seed with the branches too) from a large basket of <br />
fruit, she looked up at John, and smiled wide, playfully wagging her little goat tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Greg.&quot; Maria said &quot;You've done well. Now please, leave so that the two us can be alone together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, your Majesty.&quot; With that, Rene could no longer contain herself - she jumped on Greg's back, and the two raced out of the room, <br />
and down to one of the unoccupied lower rooms were they could get to &quot;know&quot; eachother better. Rene could be heard giggling all the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, my lover.&quot; Maria said, smiling and playfully motioning with her finger.<br />
<br />
John sat on the left side, while Maria was on his left, lying on her front, and looking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you've finally given up, have you?&quot; she asked playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't given up on saving humanity, or you.&quot; he bravely replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee-hee! Save ME?&quot; she asked with a look of mirth on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you are under the control of the virus, and that it's making you do all this.&quot; he told her &quot;The Maria I know would never act like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eee-hee-hee! I guess you don't know me as well as you thought you did!&quot; she said, grinning like a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly John.&quot; she replied, smiling and batting her eyelashes at him &quot;This is what I wanted from the beginning. Mankind is so corrupt and cruel. It <br />
was on a path of self-destrution. When I heard the stories about the vase containing the ancient magic to repopulate the satyr race, I jumped at <br />
the chance. It was said that the first person to open it would become the ruler, and so I have. I was scared at first, but knowing what would <br />
follow gave me the courage to smile again. However, in spite of all I've gained, I still lack one thing - a husband to rule beside me as the new <br />
satyr king. We will have many children, as will all our kind. I told you we'd get married and have the happiest wedding anyone's ever seen. This <br />
is exactly what I had in mind right from the start!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the virus keeps spreading,&quot; John said &quot;humans as a species will become extinct, and nothing will be left to remember of it. I came to speak <br />
with you, hoping you'd listen to reason and stop this before it's too late. Please Maria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; she asked with a pouty look on her face &quot;I thought you loved me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; he replied &quot;and that's why I can't let you do this. Please. It's not fair to the humans that are left if they don't want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria thought about it for a few minuets, and then gave John her answer.<br />
<br />
Smiling, she said ...</p>
