<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Got two more coming for now, then a sex scene, and then thats me done for a bit.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I was kind of hoping for sooner rather than later.” Jake said. Nathan winced, not wanting a repeat of last time, but wanting relief more than he wanted to guard the shame. <br />
<br />
Jenna, for her part, was not reacting like Steph. She took a moment, staring at a bulge that shifted with unnatural sensuality, taking a drag of her vape pen and letting it draconically sliding out of her nose. Looking around, she pushed Nathan to one side, half hiding him in a bush, her free hand then landing on his groin.<br />
<br />
Nathan wobbled on his legs again, nearly dropping his coffee.<br />
<br />
“I bet you are a slut, aren’t you?” She said, her dominant gaze unmoved from his eyes. “Bet you came here just to try and fuck me?” Her hand was’t firm, nor was it moving, but it&#39;s presence alone was enough to make little jhake vibrate with a pur, rubbing his face against the imprint of the hand. “You saw my tits and you just had to try didn’t you?”<br />
<br />
Nathan’s shaky paw started to rise towards them, only for Jenna to jab it back down with the mouth end of her vape pen.<br />
<br />
“That’s fucking bold, didn’t ask you to do that did I?” He shook his head, quivering. “I’m not a slut, unlike you. Despite these tits I’m not a bitch, unlike you. Isn’t that right.”<br />
<br />
Nathan nodded, steadying himself with a hand on a planter, biting his lip and trying not to look at the rest of humanity as it walked around him. He tried to put the coffee down, to free up at least one hand, but she pushed it back up, forcing him to take a sip.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t ask that either, did I?” Jenna barked with a hush, hand siding to fondle his balls, getting so close her colossal tits made contact with his chest. “God, are you that desperate?” Again, he nodded. “Well then, drink that hot coffee, all of it, and maybe then you can have a grope, if I let you.”<br />
<br />
Precum spewed out of Jake, as Nathan hurried the rest of the coffee down into his belly, scalding his throat, feeling the urge to cum overwhelm him. It took both of them, Nathan and Jake focusing in tandem, to keep the cum back, and the dog boy on his feet, as the dog girl pressed even closer. Her face was inches from his, her soft breasts weighing on him, but she remained silent, exploring Jake through the cotton.<br />
<br />
“Cum.” She whispered. It was all they needed, as a tsunami of splooge filled his pants, Jake reduced to a twitching mess.<br />
<br />
She pulled away, letting the two of them stagger back upwards, as she smile and sat on the planter. Her ass trapped his hand, but before he removed it he paused, looking at her as his composure returned.<br />
<br />
“Do you want me to remove it?” She took another drag, and shook her head. The ass was colossal, so heavy that it hurt a little, but even if it hurt a lot Nathan would have kept his hand there. “Do you want me to…”<br />
<br />
“What I want is for you to earn the orgasm I just gave you.” she said. “And earn rights to your hand back.” His hand began to fish around a little, before she shook her head. “What I want you to do is open that app, make me your mistress, and promise to come see me tonight, Nathan from Biology.”<br />
<br />
“You…” <br />
<br />
“I remember, just because I act coy doesn’t make me an idiot, and if you like transformation I might have use for you. Not gonna let you get away again.” Jenna chuckled, the vapour easing out of her nose. “Or at least, I’m not gonna let you get away with ignoring me again.” She added, shifting her ass until it better pinned Jake’s hand, until the pain eclipsed the arousal, and he was genuinely stuck. <br />
<br />
Nathan reached out through his nerves and found Jake still in a sex-drunk stupour, unable to comment, nevermind help. That said, he wasn’t sure he wanted help.<br />
<br />
“I have a deal with my friend too,” Nathan gasped, “the one you just met. I think he would be upset if I entered an exclusive relationship.” Jenna shrugged.<br />
<br />
“You two can fuck about, jusrt as long as you come running when I say you do. After a person to fuck, if I wanted a husband I’d send you to get a ring.”<br />
<br />
With that, he added her to his profile, finally getting his paw back. His wrist felt genuinely hurt by that point, and as he began to rub the joint Jenna jumped back and let out a shout. <br />
<br />
“Oh no!” She squeaked. “Did you just bang it against the planter?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah?” Nathan laughed.<br />
<br />
“Come with me, I’m gonna make it all better.” She said, a sinister tone buried amongst the innocence.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the hour, the last few minutes before midday, were spent back in the Coffee Lab, watching Jenna’s preformative concern as she bandaged up his injured paw. He explained to her colleagues that he had fallen as he tried to flirt with her, while she joked that she didn’t even know it was flirting, but gave him her number anyway. While it was all very hot Jenna, the real Jenna, would have never given her number to someone like him. Suddenly, that line of acceptability they discussed yesterday, shrunk, leaving oddworld Jenna on the far side of it.<br />
<br />
She escorted him to the bus, putting him on it just as a feeling of freshness flooded Nathan’s pants, Jake coming to at last. As she stepped away she pulled in Nathan&#39;s paw, giving it a kiss, her face blushing red behind the fur. She was even able to feign embarrassment.<br />
<br />
When the bus became quiet, yards from his house, Jake finally piqued up, his little paw pulling him out of the sheath.<br />
<br />
“Dude, that rocked.” Nathan didn’t acknowledge, but made it clear he was listening. “According to the Vac most of that is a result of this new world, that her being here made her…”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Nathan snapped. “It&#39;s all a little much, you know?”<br />
<br />
Silence fell, as Jake looked through his options menu.<br />
<br />
“We can bail if you want dude.” Jake whispered, his head knocked back to his senses. “Sorry dude I don’t know what…”<br />
<br />
Before he could finish the thought another traveller entered earshot, pushing the two back into their thoughts. The post-nut clarity started waxing and waning in and out of ideas, fears and realities, the two cooling it and reentering reality. Moments later, they were getting off the bus, alone again, in front of Nathan’s house.<br />
<br />
“You have to come out.” Jake said. “That’s the last thing you and I have to do. After that, we can bail.”<br />
<br />
Nathan nodded, pushing open the gate, walking up the garden path.</p>
