<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark and Kevin were scared of being seeing like that. They didn&#39;t have anywhere to run, so they just were able to hide under Raul&#39;s bed. It wasn&#39;t too big and their feet were showing outside.<br />
&quot;We need to hide our feet!&quot; Kevin said.<br />
&quot;How? This bed is too small!&quot; Mark replied.<br />
&quot;I think I have an idea, but you won&#39;t like it!&quot; Kevin said and he got over Mark. &quot;Turn a little now!&quot; <br />
Mark was upset because of what Kevin had made but he knew that they didn&#39;t have time to fight each other, so he obeyed him and they ended in a cross position. Then, they kept quiet trying to hide from who was coming to the room. However, under the bed were a lot of cum and precum which had fallen from Jimmy&#39;s and Raul&#39;s dicks.<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; Mark said. &quot;These things are all over around! I don&#39;t want to be here too much time!&quot;<br />
&quot;Me neither..&quot; Kevin hushed him.<br />
<br />
Lucile entered to her son&#39;s bedroom with the pill bottle on her hands. She hadn&#39;t been able to make a choice and she had thought that looking at his nephew could help her. She saw that Raul had entered too and both boys were lying on the bed. Lucile wondered if they were sleeping or exhausted. Mark and Kevin can see her getting closer by her feet moving. When she was near to the bed she saw that both boys were covered in a lot of fluids. She freaked out and avoided to touch it.<br />
&quot;My por angels...&quot; She said. &quot;Did Jimmy get older?&quot;<br />
Lucile realized that his nephew was as big as Raul. They looked like twins with minor differences like the hair and skin colors. Lucile knew that it must be caused by the pills. She was thinking about it when she smelled the bad odor coming from Jimmy&#39;s feet.<br />
&quot;Oh, Jimmy... You will need foot deodorant!&quot; Lucile said. &quot;I think I have one in the garage&quot;<br />
Lucile left the pill bottle on Raul&#39;s desk and she went to the garage to look for the deodorant. She was trying to avoid to make a decision so this could give her some time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she&#39;s out!&quot; Kevin said. &quot;We can go out now&quot;<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; Mark said. &quot;I was beginning to despair!&quot;<br />
Yeah, me too!&quot; Kevin replied. &quot;My nose can&#39;t bear any more reek!&quot;<br />
&quot;I think Raul&#39;s mother knew about what happened to the guys.&quot; Mark said. &quot;She wasn&#39;t too surprised&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, she left these pills over the desk...&quot; Kevin said while he took the bottle. &quot;It has no label... Maybe I should try one&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you saying...?&quot; Mark said when he saw that Kevin was taking a pill from a small bottle. &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t do that! Are you stupid?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe is an antidote&quot; Kevin said. &quot;She had left it for some reason...&quot;<br />
&quot;If it was an antidote why didn&#39;t she use it with Raul and Jimmy?&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe she didn&#39;t bear the bad odor...&quot; Kevin said. &quot;Anyway... I will take one!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t do it!&quot; Mark said. &quot;First, we need to get this out of us. I&#39;m tired of too much cum!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Kevin said. &quot;What could be worse tan our actual situation?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say that!&quot; Mark said. &quot;Things always get worst after that!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ridiculous! Hahaha!&quot; Kevin said but a sudden pain changed his mind. The pain was on all his body. &quot;My body hurts!&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you!&quot; Mark replied but then he felt a similar sensation, except that he felt it on his butt.<br />
Both boys closed their eyes as the pain was increasing. After some minutes the pain was gone and they were breathing hardly in relief.<br />
&quot;Something happened to us!&quot; Mark said. &quot;I know it!&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, I know..&quot; Kevin said. &quot;Did you get smaller?&quot;<br />
Mark saw Kevin and he realized what happened to him.<br />
&quot;No, you grew up&quot; Mark answered. &quot;You&#39;re taller now... maybe a foot taller&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?!&quot; Kevin yelled. &quot;That&#39;s great!&quot;<br />
&quot;And...&quot; Mark said. &quot;What happened to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see anything different on you...&quot; Kevin said while he was looking for any change on Mark&#39;s body &quot;You look the same... Oh, wow!&quot;<br />
&quot;What happens?&quot; Mark questioned.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pissing&quot; Kevin said. &quot;Can&#39;t you feel it?&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you taaaa...&quot; Mark said but he saw that Kevin was right. &quot;My bladder! I can&#39;t control it! I can&#39;t stop!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow... dude. You&#39;re unlucky...&quot; Kevin said. &quot;That&#39;s a bad change...&quot;<br />
Mark was red in embarrassment. &quot;I can&#39;t wear these pants anymore. I will take some of Raul&#39;s&quot;<br />
&quot;And you will piss them too...&quot; Kevin said. &quot;You need a diaper, hahaha!&quot;<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t use a diaper!&quot; Mark shouted accompanied by a loud fart. &quot;No, no, no! No from behind!&quot; And without being able to do anything he crapped a little bit of poop. &quot;NOOO&quot;<br />
&quot;Gross!&quot; Kevin said. &quot;At least go to the bathroom!&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t run like this!&quot; Mark said. &quot;Raul! Son of a bitch! What have you done to me?!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey! Control yourself!&quot; Kevin said,<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot; Mark replied. &quot;I can&#39;t control my body!&quot;<br />
&quot;And they can&#39;t too&quot; Kevin said. &quot;Calm down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucile had taken the foot deodorant and she was returning to her son&#39;s bedroom. She was wondering where Raul&#39;s Friends were because she had seen them on the camera. Maybe they had left when they saw Raul&#39;s big member.<br />
&quot;It will be better than handle with them...&quot; She thought.<br />
But, when she opened the door of her son&#39;s bedroom she saw both boys in the middle of the room. She was astounded because she was seeing how Mark was pissing and shitting.<br />
&quot;Mark!&quot; She screamed. &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Calm down, mrs. L!&quot; Kevin said and his manly voice made Lucile to get shocked. &quot;He can&#39;t control it! It&#39;s because of the cum that Raul was shotting!&quot;<br />
Lucile thought that Kevin was crazy, but then she realized that he was higher than before. Also, he and Mark had thick beards and big feet. Definitely something was wrong.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry guys!&quot; Lucile said. &quot;I didn&#39;t have any idea!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, mrs. L&quot; Kevin said. &quot;At least you have understood our situation...&quot;<br />
Lucile didn&#39;t know what to say about it.<br />
&quot;Finally...&quot; Mark said. &quot;I think I&#39;m done.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you ok, Mark?&quot; Lucile asked.<br />
&quot;Yes, but I think I could need some clothes...&quot; Mark stopped for a second and said. &quot;...Maybe I need a diaper...&quot;<br />
&quot;I think I have one in the garage...&quot; Lucile said. &quot;I will look for it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, mrs. L, you have everything in your garage!&quot; Kevin said.<br />
&quot;Well, I used to work at a pharmacy&quot; Lucile said. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a moment. Please, stay here.&quot;<br />
Both boys nodded and Lucile left the room again.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great. You increased your height and lose my basic functions...&quot; Mark said to Kevin.<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t say that...&quot; Kevin answered. &quot;At least you have got a big caboose!&quot;<br />
Mark touched his butt and he realized that Kevin was right. His butt had growth huge and it had bubbled in a perfect round shape. He smiled a little bit but his smile quickly disappeared when he felt some crap on his rectum.<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; Mark said. &quot;I have touched my own crap!&quot;<br />
&quot;Better go to clean your ass!&quot; Kevin said. &quot;I will try to clean some of this mess... I don&#39;t want any more surprises...&quot;<br />
Mark nodded and he left Kevin alone in the room with both sleepy boys. He had told Mark that he didn&#39;t want any other change, but actually, he was excited about the changes. He thought that those pills could have something to do with these. So, he thought that if he took some of them, he could get a good change like Raul and Jimmy&#39;s big dicks. Now, he needed to think how many pills he would take.</p>
