<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Karyu was a four, Anija was a three, being just as attracted to hens as he was to drakes.<br />
<br />
Like many bisexual drakes, he found that there was a little bit of a dominance and submission quality to his sexuality with drakes, with rivalry instincts blending with his sense of attraction in an emotional cocktail that could turn as easily toxic as lustful. His instinct to treat Vrack as a territorial rival made it necessary for him to decide whether he was going to play the role of a gloating victorious drake or a more servile defeated drake. However, Anija was experienced enough to know that there were drakes that only liked other drakes, and they knew nothing about these games, tending to be more egalitarian.<br />
<br />
Anija&#39;s feelings toward Vracka lacked that quality, but instead, he had an intense desire to prove himself to her. He knew that he was the right drake for her, and he showed it by posing gallantly and handsomely for her. He spent a while smiling and taking in the beauty before him. He felt a little out of his element, though.<br />
<br />
Vracka turned around, one forepaw raised anxiously as Anija hesitated. &quot;It&#39;s my horns, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she said, looking dismayed. &quot;You find them hideous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anija was instantly flooded with a deep sadness for Vracka, momentarily, for her huge horns. He knew that hens with large horns were often ridiculed, and she must have been bullied terribly when she was young. Was that why she had given up being a hen? She had not stayed a hen long enough, he realized, to find out that some drakes are especially attracted to big-horned females. Stepping forward gallantly, he said to her, &quot;My sweet hen, I was just waiting for your permission to approach you,&quot; he said with tones of sincere respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said meekly. After a pause, she added, tentatively, &quot;please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anija slithered up to her, and the azure drake inhaled the beautiful, white hen&#39;s pure, sweet scent.<br />
<br />
Before he could get far, Anija sat down on her haunches and turned her forequarters and head to look back at him, a serious expression on her face. &quot;You don&#39;t have to pretend you find these things attractive,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;I want us to be able to be honest with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anija arched his neck humorously, and he turned the question around on her. &quot;I would be as likely to ask you,&quot; he said, &quot;if you found a drake like me attractive.&quot; He posed for her in a way that exaggerated his uncommonly feminine traits. Anija was built like something between a scholarly nerd and a feminine male, being like that favorite professor that had the soft, warm, gentle nature about him that some professors do. During the time he had spent in the city, during his youth, he had been nastily spurned by drakes that had only liked more masculine drakes than himself, and drakes like that were certain that he was merely inherently inferior.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better watch out, or you&#39;ll get yourself rimmed again,&quot; Vracka muttered.<br />
<br />
Anija uttered a dismissive laugh. &quot;A hen, trying to give a rimjob! Oy, vey! You crack me up, Vracka!&quot; he said, finding this very funny.<br />
<br />
At this, Vracka scowled indignantly, but her and Anija getting back to their usual teasing really was making her feel better. &quot;I can rim you as well as a hen as I ever could as a drake, you overgrown shrimp,&quot; she said challengingly.<br />
<br />
Anija started to walk away, saying, &quot;Oh, let&#39;s take a poll on that,&quot; he said hilariously. &quot;Let&#39;s go ask every member of the Crew.&quot; His eyes flew open, though, as he was brought up short.<br />
<br />
The white hen had grabbed him firmly around his haunches, and she had used one of her horns to lift Anija&#39;s tail out of the way, making room for her snout to drive itself home. Her long, supple tongue drove its way deep into Anija&#39;s bowels, quickly finding the bump where his prostate was located. Slowly, the dragoness tongue-fucked the drake, murring softly into his ass.<br />
<br />
The azure eastern dragon, who had not resisted, was quickly dropped down on his chest, with his forelegs sprawled out in front of him. His eyes were closed in deep pleasure as the hen serviced his ass lustily. This was certainly a surprise, coming from a hen, but then again, Vrack had done it many enough times when he was a drake. &quot;O-o-o-oh...okay,&quot; he gasped as his cock began dripping steadily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just okay?&quot; Vracka asked archly, lifting her head up from her work. In her eyes, there was a definite &quot;girl power&quot; gleam.<br />
<br />
Anija slithered his forequarters up to Anija and turned his head to kiss her on the muzzle, not minding his own taste on her breath. &quot;You do a fine job,&quot; he said as he broke the kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...the horns are okay for a hen?&quot; Anija asked timidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look beautiful on a hen for the same reason that they look beautiful on a drake,&quot; Anija said impatiently. &quot;After that rimjob, though, you have me all flustered. What do you say we start working on that clutch you are after?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Vracka posed with her hindlegs spread out invitingly, and she cast a coy look over her shoulder. &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask, cutie,&quot; she replied.</p>
