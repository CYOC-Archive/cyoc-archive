<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Odd...&quot; Mark thought to himself as he holds the small pendant. Even odder was the basket right next to it. Something about it seemed to be calling out to him. Almost like an urge to put it on. He examined it a bit more. There was a symbol that almost looked like a bunny on the front with some weird markings on the back. &quot;Did that thing really drop this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark eventually shook his head no. This wasn&#39;t making any sense. &quot;The easter bunny,&quot; he mocked himself for even thinking of the idea. However, the strange basket of multiple, multi-colored eggs still intrigued him. At the very least someone must have been playing a very elaborate trick. He shoved the pendant in his pocket and then grabbed the basket.<br />
<br />
Heading back to his college dorm room, Mark saw people pointing at him. He just happily swung the basket back and forth while maintaining a bounce in his step, almost mocking the idea that he could be doing this with any other intent than irony. People laughed and he laughed right along with them. He knew how silly it had to be seeing a 21 year old guy with a purple and pink easter basket filled with easter eggs. Yet, as he passed different people, he almost wanted to just hand them out. <br />
<br />
That would have been a step too far. Mark knew that. He wasn&#39;t exactly Mr. Popular, but he knew handing out eggs to strangers wasn&#39;t a good idea. After he almost reached in and handed an orange and black stripped one to a football player, he knew he needed to rush back. &quot;Hey Leo,&quot; Mark said as he closed the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Leo responded. He was on his computer with his headphones on. <br />
<br />
Mark rushed over and put a golden colored egg on the desk. &quot;Look what I found!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;An egg?&quot; Leo studied the thing. It looked just like a chicken egg, but it looked to be solid yellow. Not painted or dyed, but like it came out of the chicken that bright yellow color. &quot;What&#39;s this for?&quot; He picked it up, completely unsure why Mark would have something like this. As he touched it, it started to rattle. Almost like something was in it. &quot;What the hell!?&quot; He set it back down on the desk and looked at Mark for some kind sign that this was a prank. Yet, Mark looked just as confused. And curious.<br />
<br />
The two leaned in as a crack formed on the egg. Then slowly a bright yellow figure emerged. There stood a translucent little lion. Barely even 4 inches tall, it let out a massive yawn. &quot;Awwww!&quot; Mark squealed as he saw the tiny figure wander around the desk. It moved closer to Leo&#39;s hand and rubbed up against it. &quot;I think he likes you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?!&quot; Leo repeated. &quot;What is this thing!? And how did you get it!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, I found it,&quot; Mark said. &quot;But if that&#39;s what these little things are, I need to hand some more out. I&#39;m sure people will love it!&quot; A joyous feeling welled up inside him and the urge to hand those eggs out was impossible to ignore. If they contained something as cute as that little lion, nuzzling against his roommate, the others had to have something just as adorable. He grabbed his basket and rushed out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Leo called out for him. But it was too late. The door slammed shut and he was alone with this tiny creature. &quot;What even are you?&quot; he leaned in closer to get a better look. Somehow it looked exactly like a lion. But even more surprising was that it almost seemed to have a will of its own. It brushed its furry mane against Leo&#39;s hand. He could almost feel the tough tawny fur rubbing against his skin. But as Leo moved closer to examine it, it moved closer to the desk. And before Leo realized it, the lion had jumped from his desk right into his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?&quot; Leo jumped from his seat. He&#39;d felt a bit of a thud against his face, but then nothing. Looking around, he tried to find that little creature. But nothing. Nothing was around him. He looked under his desk. In his chair. Just around anything. But still nothing. The lion was small, but it also radiated a bit of a golden light around it, so he should have been able to find it easily. <br />
<br />
Then he reached for his face. It was stupid, but that was the only place he hadn&#39;t properly looked yet. As his fingers touched his nose, something felt off. Almost like it&#39;d grown a bit larger. Leo rushed to the bathroom to get a better look. &quot;What--&quot; he uttered. He couldn&#39;t say anything else as he reached for his nose and touched it. The problem was it wasn&#39;t his nose. It was growing wider. His nostrils flared but looked like they were growing bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on!?&quot; he managed to cry out, but noticed that his mouth no longer felt the same. Each of his teeth had sharpened and were growing inside his mouth. Rapidly taking up any room they could. Leo braced himself on the sink. His nails had grown sharp, scratching the ceramic basin. The pain of his bones reshaping and growing was too much. He could feel his jaw pushing further and further out from his face. It grew widen with each passing second.<br />
<br />
Muscle packed onto what was already there. His body bulged with power. The shirt he was wearing quickly became nothing but shreds as his arms and shoulders grew bigger. Each one growing more defined and powerful. His chest pushed far out in front of him while a bit of a belly laid underneath. His body bulked up into something more like a powerlifter, bit, strong and with just a little bit of weight on him to make him even stronger.<br />
<br />
Leo&#39;s mouth opened as he tried to stretch it out. He could feel them molding into something else. Something far more animalistic. &quot;I have to go find Mark,&quot; he growled. The normal sound of his voice deepened to something far more masculine. Each word had a hard gravely sound as he reached for the doorhandle. But as Leo took a step he fell forward. His feet had shifted into something more like paws. He could see dark claws that had torn through his socks. He tried to pick himself back up but the sudden change in his posture sent him back to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta... Find... Mark...&quot; Leo crawled for the elevator. Golden fur started to erupt from his hands and feet. It quickly covered the rest of his body. A dark brown beard covered his growing jawline, blending into the hair on his head. It grew unbelievably fast. But suddenly, he stopped. Leo stood up. Brushed himself off. He looked around a bit confused. Something seemed off as he swished his large tail back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; he wondered to himself for a second. An 8 foot tall 400 pound naked lion man stood where Mark would have been. His muscles bulged with power and strength. Every part of him masculine strength. &quot;Gotta find Mark? I guess I should probably thank him for the easter egg.&quot;</p>
