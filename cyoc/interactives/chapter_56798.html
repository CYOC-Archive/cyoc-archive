<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Madam Serenity left the grounds, glade she didn't run into Julie along the way, she <br />
took one more look at the trio of fountain heads, not knowing one had been a lupman <br />
female love doll for a short while.<br />
<br />
'That girl Amy, and Penny have a lot of work ahead of them.' <br />
<br />
Driving to Penny's apartment and find it uninhabited felt like an old song to Madam <br />
Serenity.  So Serenity called, begrudgingly, call Gillie again, and asked if she had any idea <br />
where Penny could be. <br />
<br />
The conversation was cold to say the least. But Gillie did let it slipped that Penny was <br />
apparently her -cousin-... <br />
<br />
Gillie said that assuming Penny hadn't been kidnapped, that she was likely with her parents <br />
since her fiance was recovering from being &quot;Leoman Reclining.&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity didn't expect Gillie to have that address, but apparently she did from a directly <br />
book that Gillie admitted was -still- growing! Serenity shuddered at that. Wondering how <br />
far this 'plague' would spread, and if this plague would stop anywhere at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;And it's going to spread faster when my men, my women, get off the mend dammit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity again passed a chilling goodbye with her life long friend. 'Poor Gill. She <br />
didn't deserve this. There's so much I could be teaching her right now, I've gone through it <br />
all, but I can't believe she'd -abandon- me with that scheme of erasing her own memories. <br />
A trick I can't follow.'<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity drove to the house address, finding many buildings were now much larger <br />
to scale... to serve the people living in them that were GIANTS. <br />
<br />
When she knocked on the door, she was greeted by a plum colored wolf woman wearing <br />
(what Serenity assumed) was a black wig with chop stick, a kimono done in style of the <br />
four seasons, and had a bust-line that certainly made her practical life an aggravating <br />
nightmare. 'There's no way those things aren't a product of the game!'  Serenity felt sick at <br />
whatever perverted lunatic had forced THIS On this poor woman! <br />
<br />
She bowed, &quot;Ohayou gozaimasu Madam Serenity. What brings you to the house of the <br />
Glendale Leoman Pride?&quot; <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity remembered that she had been hired now to track down the parents of <br />
some children within the pack now, so of course she'd be more known. In particular after <br />
the war with Kurse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.... I, am looking for Penny Glen. Is she in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall fetch the mistress.&quot; Umeko left. <br />
<br />
'Mistress?' Serenity readied herself for another person corrupted by the game's <br />
temptations. <br />
<br />
The she wolf returned a minute later pushing a wheelchair in witch a light almost white <br />
beige woman was sitting, with a leoman about her age with a gold brown mane flanking <br />
her.  The she wolve dotted over her like a sycophant, Penny didn't look too thrilled at that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity?&quot; Penny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny Glen? I have four leomans in my car who need use of your particular talent.&quot; 'No <br />
need to drive her insane with the details.' <br />
<br />
Penny's eyes widened as it clicked what 'particular talents' Madam Serenity could be <br />
logically referring to.  &quot;I.. I understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
Leslie meanwhile miles away thought, 'Oh well. Looks like they won't be staying part of the <br />
still/eternal/unmoving/art world after all.'<br />
<br />
Helen replied, 'Well, WE are art, they're sex toys, not nearly as dignifying. Our forms simply <br />
appeal to the Alpha's tastes, they're just to appeal to some sicko who can't get a date.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
'So there are 'supposed' to be five statues, and thus a complete sub-pack for Kira, Sunny <br />
and Luna, heh, I mean Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Monkey King.' Helen thought/sent/spoke <br />
teasingly.  <br />
<br />
Nelson quipped, 'Don't worry Kira, you're a romeo enough to convince two beautiful and <br />
intelligent she wolves to mate with you after knowing them for only a few days, and then <br />
deciding to tie the knot while you're at it. ... I'm sure you'll find a couple she wolves to fill <br />
the other nitches soon enough who won't mind sharing eternity with you.' <br />
<br />
'On the bright side,' Kira thought/sent/spoke, 'No matter how many people I bring into the <br />
eternal world out of the transient world, I can't just leave anyone I bring in there if I want <br />
to enter the transient world myself. So we don't need to worry about our pups abandoning <br />
anyone...' <br />
<br />
After the pups and cubs had relocated to the library to explore the Pack's vast collection of <br />
books, the trio of giant statues found a new visitor looking up at them.  She touched Kira <br />
as an offer bowl appeared at his feet as well, he was supposed to be the aspect of a minor <br />
deity after all. <br />
<br />
It was a female lupman glass pup, but it clearly wasn't Alice, Samantha, or Abbey, unlike <br />
the uniform appearance (in other species' opinion) of leoman females, lupman females <br />
were much easier to tell apart. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aspects of the gods, avatars, facets of Amy's shinto gods who do not carry the grudges of <br />
the whole.&quot; She said formally then switched to a slightly less formal tone, &quot;Hello aspect of <br />
Tsukuyomi-no-kami, aspect of Monkey King, and aspect of Amaterasu. Luna, Kira, Sunny. <br />
I am an avatar myself. Congratulations on becoming mothers and a father to be. <br />
<br />
Three silent gasps of surprise.<br />
<br />
My name is Marie-Eliza. I was turned into Glass, an aspect of Kurse during the fight for Big <br />
Bad Island and the world.  After Kurse's death I was left with her power, but not her <br />
insanity or sociopathery or delusional state. I am the game in a way, but not with any of it's <br />
evil.  I can sense anywhere it lays it's hands, and you technically have a turn at the game <br />
Kira, so I can sense you.   I felt that you needed some explaination at your current roles in <br />
fate. <br />
<br />
She looked at Sunny, &quot;When your brother  Susanoo-no-Mikoto was drunk and killed one of <br />
your hand maidens -or least he was drunk in some versions-, you went into hiding in <br />
protest of his actions. As the sun god, this left the world slowly freezing to death. <br />
<br />
Your friend, Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto, the goddess of stage performance among other <br />
things, was able to trick you out of hiding in a trick involving her own stage talents and a <br />
giant mirror and saying how 'this beautiful one is outside', which eventually lured you out, <br />
and you brother swore to not repeat his actions.  To note also, there are other versions of <br />
the myth that say  Susanoo-no-Mikoto was the one who struck down the goddess of food. <br />
<br />
She looked at Luna, Tsukuyomi-no-kami saw Uke Mochi produced the flawless feast by <br />
spitting out a fish into the ocean, coughing up rice, and the rest of the feast out of her <br />
rear.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt the three souls inside the statues shudder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still, as a pack you're incomplete since Monkey King Disguised As A Wolf it seems is <br />
effectively becoming his own sub-pack of living art with a divine touch if one accepts the <br />
existence of Amy's gods. So it seems that Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi laid aside with the <br />
Monkey King.  Or at least these two aspects of them. <br />
<br />
And at least one aspect of Uke Mochi survived to reconcile with Tsukuyomi. Ame-no-<br />
Uzume-no-Mikoto will join aside her friend it seems. Don't worry, existence loathes a <br />
vacuum. Fate itself will insure that two more will come along soon enough to complete the <br />
art pack of lupmen avatars of Amy's gods. As a fellow avatar -though only of a girl with <br />
power thrust upon her that she doesn't want and she know can't be trusted to anyone- I <br />
wish you all the greatest of happiness with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza's avatar vanished. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
1689 August 10th  Day of Fate <br />
<br />
As Joella looked at her grandfather and to where one of her mothers had left in a storm, <br />
she sighed. &quot;I wish you wouldn't fight grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Running Bear looked at this girl who had called him grandfather. &quot;I'm sorry  Joella. I don't <br />
mean to be that way. But your mothers... are... very set in their ways... they do not like to <br />
compromise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joella had no argument there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Both looked to see a naked human girl with her dark hair in a pony tail.<br />
<br />
Running Bear quickly put a coat around her put it fell off her almost instantly, he tried this <br />
again with the same result. the geass would never harm Running-Bear, not in a thousand <br />
years. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mama, I mean Miss Gita, I mean Miss Gaal, says I don't need to wear clothes if I don't want <br />
to, so nay!&quot; Lark stuck her tongue out at Running-Bear. <br />
<br />
Joella said, &quot;Lark that's not nice. And what are you doing here so far from Glendale-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamas-, I mean, the witches wanted one of us to be with you to protect you in case the <br />
evil hunter army came this way and tried to double back and tried to use you as a hostage.&quot; <br />
She went to attention. &quot;I'm to destroy anyone who even tries to harm you! The witches have <br />
given me a super important job!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such Responsibility from you. Accepting your role in what is expected of you.&quot; Running-<br />
Bear said, &quot;How grown up of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lark looked very confused, &quot;But grown ups are bad, er, I mean, all other grown ups are bad <br />
except for you and the witches, so that CAN'T be a grown up thing! And nobody should <br />
have to work! Everyone should just be able to play.&quot; <br />
<br />
Running Bear sighed, &quot;Maybe in a fantasy world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which the witches are going to make that everyone can play in!&quot; <br />
<br />
Running-Bear wondered, if his daughters had ASKED people to join them, like they had <br />
with Free... would more have willingly joined them? 'Gita. Golwyn. Giselle.' <br />
<br />
 Golgatha was storming through the praying town, aggravated at her foster father's words. <br />
'How could he ask us to compromise WITH EVIL? One who compromises with evil gives <br />
ground to evil!'<br />
<br />
Some miles away Marie Cruz shivered. <br />
<br />
Vadican asked, &quot;Marie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, just thinking how scary it is that there a few thing that I agree with the witches <br />
on. I'm not happy about that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Everything has come too far, and everyone is depending on us like we're depending on <br />
them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz caught sight of the trees she knew where more than they appeared... most to <br />
how two of the giant boxing-punching-fighting-trees were bored playing cards.  A gift <br />
from Oliver to the hexed town's protectors. <br />
<br />
And a big wild near next to them with it's neck broken. A couple coyotes with a broken <br />
neck also added to the pile. They took their duty of defending Glendale quite seriously. <br />
<br />
Vadican whispered, &quot;How do they see what faces are on the cards?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz whispered back, &quot;Likely the same way you do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Now they just waited for the signal, and hoped the trees continued their card game until <br />
then. <br />
<br />
Back in the praying town, Golgatha turned an old man into a little boy here, turning back <br />
time for a cripple to before the accident there. <br />
<br />
But she was so distracted by her god father's worlds she didn't see where she was going <br />
and bumped into a tall man wearing a hat, jacket, and carrying a musket. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Woman! Stay out of the way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should stay out of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your tongue Woman! Have you seen a woman nigger about?! She have escaped this <br />
way some time ago according to some other people I asked.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Her name was Afua?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! Where is she Woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Safe from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU LITTLE!&quot;   <br />
<br />
He back handed her, or tried to, he found his body paralyzed. <br />
<br />
Golgtha slowly walked around him. While the witches had many flaws, sexism was not one <br />
of them.  The man's gun turned into a tree in the middle of town. The big man's clothes <br />
vanished, and he was slowly pushed down by an invisible force onto all fours. His hands <br />
and feet became the same, fingerless hooves. Gold fur covered his entire body as antlers <br />
grew from his skull VERY painfully. <br />
<br />
Beauregard, screamed in his mind. As his eyes grew wide and became orbs as solid black <br />
as his soul. The tail again painfully pushed out of his rear. His face became a muzzle and <br />
his teeth flat. His size and muscle mass increased. However he remained frozen. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall live your life as a -coward- among Gold Dear. NOW GIT!&quot; She then slapped him <br />
harshly on the rear, the Gold Deer buck let out a pathetic cry and  Beauregard fled madly <br />
out of the praying town. <br />
<br />
Feeling very satisfied with herself, Golgatha continued on her way back home unopposed.</p>
