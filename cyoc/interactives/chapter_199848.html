<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...A female pirate captain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence. Pat opened his mouth, but no words came out. Whereas in hindsight he could have predicted Ian&#39;s wish, Caden&#39;s was completely out of left field. Well, he knew his friend had an interest in pirates -- but <i>female?</i><br />
<br />
Ian raised an eyebrow. But, while he was surprised, he seemed to be taking it in stride. Evan, however, sagged back against the wall, staring at Caden, and he was the one who spoke first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, really? That&#39;s... that&#39;s almost crazier then Ian turning into a green fox guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, exactly.&quot; Caden crossed his arms defiantly. &quot;If Ian can turn into a green Japanese fox, then I should be able to turn into a pirate chick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Arannese,</i>&quot; corrected Ian -- or Aranor? Seeing the green kitsune in the flesh, Pat couldn&#39;t help but wonder himself which name was more appropriate. &quot;Aranna, Aranor&#39;s homeland, takes some influence from Japan, but I was also inspired by Tolkien.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Caden rolled his eyes. &quot;Point is, if you can get a &#39;crazy&#39; wish, then so can I. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I guess,&quot; stammered Pat. He ubbed his head with his free hand. &quot;Turning you into a girl shouldn&#39;t be an issue...&quot; He tossed the stone up and caught it. &quot;I&#39;m just... I never knew you were interested... in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well...&quot; Caden blushed slightly and closed his eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve always been interested in girls in a different way then you guys. Well, you and Ian, heh.&quot; Evan was bi but mostly preferred guys. &quot;What&#39;s it like? To have boobs, to have a... pussy instead of a cock? I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m trans, so I never dared say anything... Not that you would &#39;judge&#39; me, right?&quot; He opened his eyes to glance challengingly at Evan, who shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, of course not, bro... this is just... weird. But not, like, <i>bad.</i> Really, the &#39;pirate&#39; thing is the really <i>weird</i> part. How is that even gonna work??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering that as well,&quot; added Ian. &quot;We&#39;re in the middle of a landlocked town, in the 21st century. What aspects of the world might be changed to accommodate you as a pirate captain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph.&quot; Caden bounced on his heels a bit. &quot;Why should anything change? I&#39;m not asking for a ship or a crew... yet, heh. I don&#39;t need those to be a captain. You&#39;ve got your wish, let me have mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ian shook his head, but leaned back with a resigned smile. &quot;<i>Touché</i> I guess. Well, we&#39;ll find out soon enough. I suppose Pat can revoke the wish if somehting goes awry. And I can&#39;t deny I&#39;m curious.&quot; He folded his fingers together, a gesture none of the others had ever seen him use. It made Pat feel a bit uneasy, reminding him that his friend was different inside now as well as outside.<br />
<br />
It made him hesitate a bit about granting Caden&#39;s wish, more than Ian&#39;s actual argument had. But seeing Caden about to burst from the delay, he buried his doubts and cleared his throat. &quot;I wish Caden was a pirate -- lady -- captain!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smoo-&quot; Caden began to jibe, but the word morphed into a higher-pitched, breathy &quot;-- ooohhhh, yeees...&quot; as he began to feel the pleasant warmth of transformation blossom through him as it had Ian. He reached up, rubbing at his nipples through his shirt, feeling them grow large and plump and sensitive. <i>Sooo...</i> senstive... ah-already...&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued to moan as his friends saw his chest gain in volume. Soon he wasn&#39;t just rolling his nipples between his fingers, he was fondling a pair of hefty breasts. Meanwhile, his face lost its masculine squareness, his lashes grew out and his lips grew full. Hints of rouge appeared on his face, as his skin lost its blotchy paleness to an even tan. His hair became a more fiery shade of red that feel down around his shoulders in a mass of curls.<br />
<br />
Although his clothes did not pull away from him as they had for Ian&#39;s kitsune transformation, the bulge at his crotch was still clearly visible as his jeans turned into black breeches; a bulge that seemed to be pushed back into him as the fabric tightened, until all that was left was the suggestion of a smooth mound. The breeches also highlighted his expanding hips and thighs, growing in time with his breasts -- <i>her</i> breasts -- to give the new girl a voluptuous hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
His shoes climbed his legs as they turned into polished black leather boots, fastened by a gold buckle each, a heel adding a couple of inches to her height. And his t-shirt began to diverge in colour and texture. The front became white silk with a frilly lace neck-line that dipped lower and lower until it barely contained Caden&#39;s now DD bust, showing off the deep, narrow canyon as it squeezed the two smooth globes together.<br />
<br />
But the sides and back of the shirt darkened to a midnight blue, the short sleeves lengthening and widened, broad turned-back cuffs decorated with stiff gold thread forming around her wrists. Soon the two garments parted ways, and Caden was wearing a heavy great coat over a seductive blouse.<br />
<br />
As the border of the coat fell to her ankles, a tricorn faded into existence atop her head; black, trimmed in gold, a light blue plume overflowing it. From under the collar of her coat a delicate golden chain slipped, a heavy ruby pendant forming at the entrance to her cleavage. And, finally, a broad leather belt also with gold buckles materialised around her waist, a coin pouch and sheathed cutlass hanging off her left hip, and a holstered pistol off her right.<br />
<br />
Still moaning, the now female Caden slipped her blouse down further, letting her breasts pop out for easier access.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haa... haaarr... ahoy there, me beauties...&quot; The others started at the new voice, accented and sexily husky. &quot;Ye gooods... ne&#39;er thought... &#39;twould feel so... an&#39; me voice... haaaa... ahhhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heat filled Pat&#39;s cheeks -- and loins -- as Caden decided she wanted more stimulation, and slid a now elegant hand with red-painted nails down towards her breeches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; protested Evan. &quot;Don&#39;t do that in front of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; That be &#39;Cap&#39;n Dana&#39; to ye,&quot; retorted the newly minted pirate. &quot;But fine...&quot; Sighing, she pulled her questing fingers away from her crotch, and adjusted her blouse so that it once again hid her nipples beneath its ruffled lace.<br />
<br />
Ian laughed. &quot;We can explore <i>that</i> later. It --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We sure will, fox boy,&quot; Dana interrupted with a lewd grin. &quot;I saw what ye had stowed down there. I can&#39;t wait to --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you two <i>please</i> not,&quot; groaned Evan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haharr, matey! Never knew ye were such a prude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying,&quot; continued Ian, &quot;it&#39;s interesting that you have that &#39;pirate accent.&#39; I wasn&#39;t expecting <i>that.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May &#39;s well, aye? But, Hell&#39;s teeth, it be bloody hot in these clothes...&quot; Unbuckling her belt, she let it fall to the floor with a thud and jingle of coins, then shrugged off the coat, throwing it and the hat onto another chair. She shook out her curls. &quot;Better... And aye, what be the fun o&#39; bein&#39; a pirate if&#39;n ye don&#39;t talk like one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got me there,&quot; replied Ian. He stretched. &quot;So, now what? Feel any different, &#39;Captain?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harr...&quot; Dana stroked her chin, cradling her elbow in her other hand. &quot;Only thing I c&#39;n think of right now be the knowledge o&#39; swordplay. An&#39;... how... how <i>wondrous</i> it be t&#39; have tits an&#39; cun- -ny.&quot; She grinned as she caught herself. &quot;Pardon, mateys. Don&#39;t want to offend the lady.&quot; She winked at Evan, who rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An&#39;... me name has legally changed. S&#39; far as anyone outside this room knows, I&#39;ve been Dana fer... a while. Seems I were still born male, but began transitiionin&#39; a couple o&#39; years back, an&#39; got me name changed when I were sixteen. Nobody pays mind t&#39; the fact that modern tech shouldn&#39;t be able to give me a workin&#39; -- lass&#39;s innards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm. The name is also a surprise,&quot; noted Ian. &quot;I was expecting you to choose something more similar to &quot;Caden.&#39; But I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you choose it?&quot; asked Pat, finally recovered enough from his horniness to contribute. And curious about how his magic rock actually worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, so I did. I, ah, have given a bit o&#39; thought to this, actually. Not only bein&#39; a lass, but also bein&#39; a pirate... I plan to christen me ship the <i>Cadenza,</i> after me old name. Once I get her.&quot; She gave Pat another speculative glance.<br />
<br />
Figuring out what she was thinking, he shook his head. &quot;I think that&#39;s enough wishes for today, Ca- er, Dana. I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t want to overdo it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;Killjoy. That ol&#39; djinn ne&#39;er said there were a limit to his rock&#39;s powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Pat has a point.&quot; Ian came to his defense. &quot;I know Aranna still only exists inside my head, but... since my magic works here, I have to think the &#39;rules&#39; are similar. Everything has a limit, and most magic carries some price.&quot; He frowned and fell silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Evan spoke up, &quot;I think I&#39;ve seen enough far-out stuff for one day. Why don&#39;t we go do something fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d as soon go back to me home an&#39;... take stock o&#39; how certain things feel as a lady.&quot; Dana laid a hand on her bust suggestively. &quot;Sorry to leave ye high &#39;n dry, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Pat nodded. His own head was kind of spinning, and he wouldn&#39;t mind some alone time to process what had just happened -- not just the changes to his friends and himself, but what having a reality-watping, wish-granting rock would mean going forward. On the other hand, Evan looked kind of bummed that this would be the end of their hanging out.</p>
