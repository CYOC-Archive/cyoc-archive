<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eugene didn&#39;t know what it was that Coach Dane wanted on a Saturday, but he was not about to frown on the idea of getting even better numbers on his Cross Country time. This was his varsity year, and he needed to make it count. Everything that he was. Everything that he could do. Every bit of energy went into this. Into the potential. Into the passion. He had to make his times get better, every single week, or it was a waste of time.<br />
<br />
He considered it a mark of his masculinity - that he could achieve the best numbers in the school, and even potentially make it to the Olympics. His parents had forbade him since he was young from playing football, citing the risks and the dangers from collisions. And honestly, with how Britton and some of the other guys got banged up after especially grueling games? Eugene kinda got it.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t like it - he didn&#39;t appreciate that there was some fact behind their decision - but he got it. So when he felt that he needed to join a sports team, to really demonstrate his athletics, what did Eugene have but the school&#39;s other gem. The rival jewel, as it were. There was the football team, with all the risks and adversities, the epic highs and lows of high school football as it were... and then there was the track team. People came here for any number of things.<br />
<br />
David the shot-putter and his shoulders. Just...shoulders for days, that guy. <br />
<br />
As Eugene headed into the college locker room, he looked in the mirror on the wall as he walked in - sure, he wasn&#39;t as built as some of the football guys, but he was confident he looked damn good. He had thick, wavy brown hair, bright blue eyes, and a lean, tight body. He didn&#39;t really have much call for mass, per se, but he still had an amazingly toned body. His abs didn&#39;t really pop like on some of the footballers, but he still had em. And that was what counted. His skin was heavily tanned from countless days running in the fields and on the town sidewalks. Using any place he could to further his time...<br />
<br />
And speaking of which. He wondered if Coach had some new training method. The guy seemed to be pretty nervous lately. He said that the time for getting Eugene ready was closing - and if he didn&#39;t do something &quot;drastic&quot;, they might be shit outta luck. Eugene even remembered not sleeping all that well that night - troubled by the very idea of not making it after all that training. After all the stress and strain and pushing his body to its breaking point numerous times...<br />
<br />
That was when he heard the voice of his coach coming from his office further down in the locker room; &quot;Ah, St. Cloud, you came! Glad to see you&#39;re taking this as seriously as it merits. I&#39;ve managed to find something. Something that could make it for us...&quot; He sounded...conflicted. Excited, but a little nervous at the same time.<br />
<br />
Eugene turned his head and smiled a bit - then walked down into the main locker room, stepping into the door leading to the office, overlooking the numerous benches and lockers arrayed in neat lines across the area. Eugene crossed his arms as he regarded the man who&#39;d been training him for going on years now. Coach Eric Dane was a muscled guy, more in tune with the kind of football players he usually handled than Eugene - his blond hair was straight and cut short, his eyes were light brown, and he had a nice tan. <br />
<br />
Eric Dane was a man that Eugene&#39;s mom, a strict Catholic, initially had some reservations about. The coach had apparently done some raunchy videos online to make ends meet. Something about gay for pay? But it seemed like Mr. Dane was rather ashamed by them. And when Eugene had brought up his mother&#39;s reaction, Eric had asked him not to talk about it. Something about that not being &quot;his proudest moments&quot;. But it was a moment that made it clear; Eric trusted him, and in turn, Eugene saw reason to trust Eric.<br />
<br />
The coach carried with him a bottle of pills in one hand - gingerly holding them. He really did seem nervous about this. Turning the bottle over, back and forth, in his hand.<br />
<br />
Eugene nodded and said, &quot;Yeah, sure thing coach. What&#39;s the pills? Some sort of vitamin?&quot; Eugene had never really considered the more morally murky options. Mostly because they seemed so far away. Like they were for the big deal guys. The bodybuilders. The professionals. Not for some...varsity athlete.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got these from a friend of mine, developed these in a lab.&quot; Turning the container over in his hand again and holding it up, Eric said, &quot;Apparently these are gonna be used to improve stamina across the board. Derived from like, star race horses.&quot; He breathed and continued after a pause, &quot;You just need to make sure you take them as I tell you. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; Supplements...or something like that. An experiment of some kind? Honestly, Eugene wasn&#39;t that opposed to the idea. It sounded like it was a fascinating concept. So he would be able to...what? Acquire the stamina and speed and all from a champion race horse? Honestly...that might just push him over the edge and get him to that exact Olympic level. He could rest easy at night, knowing he had through...certain means...managed to push past any of his plateaus.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re sure this is all good?&quot; Eugene crossed his arms, &quot;It won&#39;t...like, hurt me none, or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but again. My buddy stressed this. Take it exactly as you&#39;re told. No more, no less.&quot; Eugene bit his lip as he saw his coach suddenly get really serious about this, &quot;If you take this, you&#39;re partaking in a big experiment. We don&#39;t know what&#39;ll happen if you use too much, and I don&#39;t wanna know. Take it only once a day, every week day, taking the weekends off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Well, okay,&quot; Eugene shrugged, &quot;I could always do with more of an edge. And this doesn&#39;t sound like androgenics.&quot; Taking the supplement bottle from his coach&#39;s hand, Eugene cradled it in his own. Feeling the jostling tiny capsules inside. &quot;You&#39;re sure I can&#39;t get caught doing these things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, they don&#39;t even know enough about it to test for em yet.&quot; Eric replied. &quot;Just...again. One a day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you say, coach, like you say.&quot; And with that, Eugene pocketed the weird &quot;gene steroids&quot; or whatever these things were, confident at least that they probably did something. As soon as he was out of eyeshot, Eugene promptly popped the bottle open for his first dose. Putting a tiny white tablet on his hand, he put it in his mouth and quickly swallowed it. Feeling it go down his gullet, Eugene didn&#39;t detect any immediate taste, or really, any immediate response.<br />
<br />
He supposed expecting it to be like the Cap Serum or something was a bit much to ask. He just hoped there&#39;d be some indication it was working. The track star hoped at least that when he came back in on Monday of next week, he would be noticeably improved enough to really show in his track times.<br />
<br />
As Eugene walked home however, he started to distinctly feel something.<br />
<br />
His muscles felt like they were squirming. Tensing constantly, flexing without his input, and pumping up. Veins starting to pop up on his bicep as he went to look at it in the middle of the sidewalk. His brow was sweaty suddenly as he raised his arm to check. His pits likewise registering that sweaty feel. Yeah, there was something happening already. He&#39;d just been a little hasty in dismissing the idea of immediate effects.<br />
<br />
Muscles began to press against his tight white t-shirt, both due to what looked like a bit more meat on his bones, and the sheer heat of the day. But if someone expected these strange squirming and tensing, growing sensations to feel awkward or painful, well, no - Eugene before long was biting his lip and awkwardly blushing as he walked. His cock was pressing up against the crotch of his pants. Forming a distinctly profane and obvious bulge that indicated intense desire.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Eugene felt like he would&#39;ve if his girlfriend was giving him the best blowjob of her whole fucking time with him. Something was really, really intensely feeling good in his crotch. And Eugene started jogging toward home, fearing that if it kept on going, he might well end up blowing his load publicly. He also couldn&#39;t help but notice that the bulge was itself a bit bigger than usual. A more strong, large indication of arousal. He kinda looked forward to inviting his girlfriend over for some fun times later.<br />
<br />
She would probably appreciate whatever effect was causing him to get a bigger dick. <br />
<br />
Then he remembered the exact details of the gene steroid, and grinned, &quot;Is it makin&#39; me fuckin&#39; hung like a---?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eugene was feeling distinctly delirious with pleasure as he crossed the street to his home. He knew from a glance at the empty driveway that his parents were out, and being that he was an only child, he didn&#39;t have to worry about any siblings. As he rushed up the driveway and awkwardly pressed himself against the door (unconsciously shoving his dick against it several times), Eugene worked on getting the door open. Awkwardly missing a couple times with his key due to the sheer intensity.<br />
<br />
Before long however, Eugene had the door open...and he just as quickly slammed it shut behind him as he hurried inside. As he got in he was already pulling his shirt off, and then his pants and underwear both at once. He was greeted by a cock much larger than the usual. Still human looking, thankfully, but the head did look slightly thicker than normal. Eugene was glad that this gene stuff didn&#39;t turn him into some kind of chimeric freak...<br />
<br />
...But his thoughts were short lived on that front as he laid there on his couch. Grinning like a fool. Looking at his manhood, bobbing up and down in front of him. Eugene was almost drooling as he thought of how he&#39;d get to use this newly big endowment. Not to mention his body. Usually, putting on any size would be call for some panic - but Eugene distinctly noticed how he had grown bigger and stronger in several key areas. Across the board he was bigger, but the defining bits were in his legs and calves.<br />
<br />
Holy shit his thighs and quads looked crazy.<br />
<br />
Before long, Eugene had his phone fished out of his pockets from where his pants lay. He was thinking about what to do. Postpone the release and wait for his girlfriend to get there? Or just look up some porn and enjoy himself now?</p>
