<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Fall came the creek water had long cleared and the week of it's gray color had slipped from everyone's thoughts. The applesauce kitchen was working as the seven happy sons helped the picking. <br />
<br />
Mason Dixson was very proud of his boys as they rolled up with load after load of Cortlands apples for the kitchen. He thought of all the happy customers and their passionate evenings serving his applesauce under a candle lighted supper.<br />
<br />
The drug company was very helpful and even gave him a manufacturer discount on the gelcaps. The smell from the kitchen was so good that the boys all stood by to catch any extra over runs of the deep golden sauce.<br />
<br />
Andrew was the first born son and at eighteen years old had on occasion sampled his father's favorite vitamin. Not that one needs that sort of thing at such a young age he was the rage of his classmates.<br />
<br />
Andrew began to complain of headaches and lower back pains. Each day of the harvest he was first to the orchard and last to come in. Yet his complaning of pains continued.<br />
<br />
As October was coming to a close Andrew looked more healthy than ever.<br />
His pains continued and a doctor appointment was now authorized. The afternoon of the appointment the doctor called and asked for Angie and Mason to come in to his office that day!<br />
<br />
&quot;Angie, Mason, I have never seen an X-ray like the one I'm about to show you now!&quot; Holding the X-ray of Andrew's backbone to the lighted plate he pointed to the bone structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, here, and most of all here! Andrew is growing more vertebra! The numbers here don't lie, between each bone is now growing one addtional vertebra bone which in time will make his back bone twice the length. Moreover is the extension at the base here, this might be considered the growth of a tail if Andrew were a animal!&quot; said the Doctor.<br />
<br />
In his thoughts Mason knew it had to be connected with the gray water in the creek during the August drought. Yet his lust for the profits from the Apple Passion sauce made him hold the information from the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was Andrew around any feed lots where he might have injested or breathed in some animal hormone?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Mason was quiet but then Angie spoke up, &quot;Yes he was to that Henry Hopper's feed lot this summer for on of those Super Farmer Convention.<br />
They were doing a government study on something to do with hybred stock. You remeber Mason, mister Hopper's big farm just twenty miles North of our farm. He has the watershed for the entire valley from the lake that ajoins his property.&quot;<br />
<br />
That afternoon Andrew was sitting by himself still having pains when Marsha his best love came by. The two walked down the lane toward the pumphouse which offered a quiet place for conversation.<br />
<br />
As normal the conversation became so heated between the two the clothing was just too confining. A cot offed a good place of comfort for their close conversations. As Andrew kissed his love her hand pushed his waiting member into her waiting slit. Moaning in the true passion which the valley was possibly named after they enjoyed the other to the fullest.<br />
<br />
Marsha was the first to beg Andrew to pull out of her aching body. &quot;Andrew you must have eaten a ton of the wild sauce your family makes! My backbone could feel your touching and the size you have grown to be is stretching my vagina something wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew smiled and kept on thrusting till he too felt a severe pain.<br />
At first he moaned and then moaned louder till he began to scream and press his hand to his lower back.<br />
<br />
Andrew's pain became painful to Marsha as she strained to pull his erect member from her groin. Clinched teeth, Andrew groaned and suddenly fainted.<br />
<br />
Marsha was trapped beneath her mate, his bodily weight seemed more than normal. She pushed and pushed to roll Andrew to the floor. Suddenly the cot flipped over and the two of them hit the floor with a thud.<br />
<br />
Marsha laid there a foot away from her lover and quickly noticed he was still buried deep in the body. Looking down his penis was larger than a Polish sausage in width. The pretty pink it had been was now more mottled of brown and dark spots.<br />
<br />
Andrew's testicles were by the same view much larger and the skin color was a deep black. Rolling up to kneeling she still had his penis stuck in her now dripping vagina. Andrew had a finger like extension protruding from above his butt. <br />
<br />
Marsha had wondered when Andrew might start sprouting some body hair but it seemed all too sudden now. As she stroked his thighs the feel of short stubble hairs were everywhere. As she fondled his balls they began to move and the penis became erect and pumped a gusher of semen into Marsha.<br />
<br />
Andrew began to awaken and moaned strangely. As he opened his eyes the bright blue pupils were now a deep dark brown. Lips that had kissed with such passion looked thicker as did his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, Andrew,!' said Marsha as she shook him awake.</p>
