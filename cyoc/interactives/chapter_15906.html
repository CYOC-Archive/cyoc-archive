<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two Shane men watched as the tow truck drove off into the distance, happily sipping their beer on the side of the road.  Neither notices the tents forming in their pants, only that this beer is making them feel really, really good.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes, Mike slaps his son on the back.  &quot;I got to take a leak.  Hold this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No prob Dad.  You're not gonna get lost?&quot;  John replied, somewhat jokingly, remembering a few years back when his father got lost in the woods behind their house after he downed a few beers and decided to chase a deer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!  No way.  I'm not even buzzed yet.  Here, see?  Still almost full.&quot;  Mike said as he handed the beer to his son.<br />
<br />
John took it and smiled.  His old man was getting slow.  John had nearly finished his and he felt really good.  Looking at the beer bottle more closely, he didn't recognize the brand.  Too bad, it was good stuff.  He probably wouldn't be able to get his friend to get him some from the local convienience store.  Looking up, he saw his Dad walk into the woods.  Did he have his hand down his pants?<br />
<br />
John shook his head, then threw it back and downed the rest of his beer.  Nice and cold.<br />
<br />
Never being the &quot;responsible&quot; type, John threw the bottleon the road.  Smirking, he started sipping his father's beer.<br />
<br />
The buzz was great.  John also finally noticed his massive erection.  He gave it a little rub which caused a thrill to run through his entire body.  Taking another sip, he noticed the tent starting to deflate slowly.  However, the sensations were still amazing and looking around, he unzipped his jeans and stuck his hands in his boxers.<br />
<br />
Utterly amazing he thought.  It felt great.  Although he hadn't spewed his load yet, he noticed through the electric tingling and the strange buzz, that it seemed that his cock was getting smaller.<br />
<br />
No matter, it still felt great.  John took a large gulp of his second beer.  It went down nice and smooth.  Looking at the bottle, he absently starting running his tounge around the top.  The bottle was getting warm, but John didn't mind.  The beer wasn't all that bad warm.  Putting the bottle in his mouth, he starting pushing and pulling it.  Meanwhile, his other hand returned to his now flacid (and seemingly smaller) cock.  Rubbing it made him feel soooooo good.<br />
<br />
A thrill ran down John's body.  Moaning loudly, he spewed out beer from his full mouth.  It ran down his face and dripped on his shirt.  Instinctively, John tried to flick off the liquid with his hand.  However, instead of coming in contact with a skinny boy's hard bony chest, he felt his hand rub something soft and sensual.  Looking down, he saw two hard nipples jutting out through his now wet shirt.  Not only were his nipples hard (and felt soooo good), they seemed to be on slight mounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; John murmered, still pleasently buzzed and very horny.  He flicked one of the nipples, gasping at the pleasent sensations these caused.  <br />
<br />
Chugging down the rest of the beer, John dropped the bottle and took off his shirt.  The shirt rubbed against his chest, causing John to shudder with excitement.<br />
<br />
The excitement turned to alarm when he looked down and saw two mounds - two breasts!  &quot;Nooo!  Shit!  What the fuck!&quot;  They seemed to get bigger as he watched, but he couldn't be sure about that.  Then he noticed brown hair flowing down the front of his face, gently caressing his two perfect breasts.  John moaned in terror and arousal.<br />
<br />
In shock, he pulled back the silky, soft hair.  It had been years since he had any hair at all.  Just running his hands through it was an incredible feeling.  Without thinking, he dropped one hand to his cock, intending to stroke it.<br />
<br />
To his shock, he felt his hand brush up against a bush.  His middle finger curled, and he felt it enter inside him!  &quot;Urrgg!  Oooooh!  Ummmmm!&quot;  It was heaven.  He began to pump his finger and rub his breasts.<br />
<br />
John lowered himself to the ground.  He knew he should stop.  He knew something was very wrong.  He knew what was happening wasn't right.  He knew he should somehow fight what was happening to him.  He knew his father would be back any minute.  But he also knew that this felt sooooo good.<br />
<br />
On his back, he noticed his once bony, thin ass was now wider, more full and soft.  Looking down his body, he noticed his skin was slightly darker, as if he had a good tan.  Lowering a hand to his new feminimity, he saw it was delicate.  His arms were slender.  He moaned loadly as his hand entered his womanhood.  Grabbing some of his long brown hair, he rubbed it against his C-cup breasts.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes in bliss, John's mind was still very much his own, however assaulted it was with this new drive.  He tried fantisizing about Molly, a girl he knew in school, but instead found himself salivating for a big cock.  Reaching back over his head, he grabbed the empty bottle beer bottle and put it in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Disgusted and exilerated, John found himself imagining it was a huge cock, just for him.  Moaning and squirming on the side of the road, John, now an absolute hot young babe, didn't know that...</p>
