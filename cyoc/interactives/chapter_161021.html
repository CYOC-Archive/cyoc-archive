<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few blocks away from Colin&#39;s home there&#39;s a middle school where a wrestling match was happening between two 12 years old boys, Zach and Ethan. Both kids, skiny but skilled, are competing for a place in their school&#39;s wrestling team. Plus this match is going to put an end to years of rivalry between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, boys. It&#39;s freestyle but I don&#39;t want anything out of place, do you get it?&quot; The coach said. He&#39;s the only one in the gym except for them. &quot;Take your positions!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to fall! Dumbass!!&quot; Zach told Ethan as he adjusted his tight red spandex singlet.<br />
<br />
&quot;In your dreams! This is my revenge!&quot; Ethan replied ready to run towards his rival. His shiny blue spandex was firmly covering his pale hairless body same as Zach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready? Begin!&quot; The coach said and both kids ran towards each other and hugged in a very uncomfortable way. &quot;Hey!! Hands away from your opponent&#39;s singlet! I don&#39;t want you to end up nude!&quot;<br />
<br />
Although, the coach was trying to calm down these kids. Their mutual hate was making them to ignore the man&#39;s words and keep fighting with intention to hurt each other. After struggling a while, they were panting but didn&#39;t seem to stop wrestling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see you won&#39;t listen to me, so-&quot; The coach was speaking with an upset tone when he was interrupted by a mysterious invisible wave that hit them all and made the kids to fall in the ground. However, they didn&#39;t stop fighting and were turning around all over the gym ignoring completely their coach&#39;s instructions. &quot;Hey! You two!! Calm down!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach was going to separate them when his assistant, who was training with the swimming team arrived to the gym very worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach!! Coach!! You must come here!! The boys in the pool!&quot; The assistant said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What happen with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know! A strange wind pushed the water and almost drown them and now they are groaning in pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A strange wind?&quot; The coach said as he remembered that something like that had pushed those wrestling kids to the floor. &quot;Ok, let&#39;s see! Keep an eye on these two.&quot; The coach said as he left the gym, however, the assistant didn&#39;t obey and ran behind him leaving Zach and Ethan alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I feel weird.&quot; Ethan told Zach as they rolled through the gym floor.  The sweat on his body seemed to increase notoriously. &quot;We should stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuugh!!!&quot; Zach complained but he didn&#39;t stop wrestling. &quot;You&#39;re trying to distract me but you won&#39;t make it!&quot;<br />
<br />
They kept tossing around the floor ignoring that the Chronivac had already started to change their young pale bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zaaach!!&quot; Ethan yelled while his body began to grow larger causing his singlet to stretch around his larger frame. Zach was growing as well and although he wanted to clench his expanding chest with his arms to relieve some of the pain, he didn&#39;t want to give an advantage to Ethan. <br />
<br />
Both kids could feel their chest widening and their whole body stretching. They can notice that pecs were starting to get notoriously bigger in their opponent&#39;s chest but they were so proud to admit it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!!&quot; Both guys yelled in unison when their pecs grew too big that they literally came out of their singlets. They can see on each other that they had aged several years in a matter of seconds. Their clothes were now stretching to their limit as their bodies had gone through puberty quickly and duplicated their body mass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooh!!&quot; Zach&#39;s feet started to grow as his toes started to open up on his socks. Ethan could feel the same as his shoes were ripping open until both guys&#39; huge manly feet were completely exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the gimmick, Ethan?!!! Drug and special effects?!!!&quot; Zach&#39;s voice was starting to change. His body continued to expand as his stomach had developed abs that began to tear off his red singlet. His muscles had grown a lot since this started as he aged from his preteens to late teens.<br />
<br />
&quot;No stupid moron! You did something to me!!&quot; Ethan yelled in a equally deeper voice. He could feel his shoulders broadening as he listened to the sounds of his singlet ripping open around him.<br />
<br />
They felt their legs stretching and enlarging as their impossible tight singlet started to burst open exposing slightly hairy legs and thick thighs. Their feet continued to grow to match the huge tree trunks that their legs had become.<br />
<br />
Now instead of two 12 years old boys there was two 20 years old men wrestling around the gym floor with so huge muscles that could put some actual grown-up wrestlers to shame. And although they were impressed by their opponent body, they didn&#39;t want to stop wrestling until one of them wins.<br />
<br />
Their eyes widened as their bodies kept growing even more. &quot;Ahhhhh!!&quot; They yelled in their now deep rumbling voices as they clenched their fists around their opponent&#39;s broad back as their biceps exploded with more muscle finally ripping their singlets completely and leaving their upper half totally exposed. Without the clothing oppression their backs and chests keep growing until they looked beyond bodybuilders.<br />
<br />
They both yelled in deep baritone voices from the pain that they were experiencing. Their already thick thighs grew larger and larger until his tight remaining clothes could no longer contain them anymore and bursted out. Without their shoes which had already ripped to shred because of their huge manly feet, now they&#39;re only wearing their tiny kid jockstrap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!! What happened to you? And what happened to me?!!!&quot; Ethan shouted as his face showed signs of discomfort as it matured to resemble that of a man in his 20’s. Zach didn&#39;t replied because he could feel his face changing as well as it grew a subtle stubble on his chin.<br />
<br />
Then, both men&#39;s cries of pain suddenly turned into moans as they feel in their tight jockstraps that their throbbing packages were the last things to catch up to their now large bodies. They didn&#39;t know it but this part was going to change according to the pornstar configuration on the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Their butts expanded instantly ripping their last clothing and leaving them completely nude in front of each other. Dr. They tried to look away but they&#39;re also curious of how their opponent was growing down there.<br />
<br />
Their faces turned red of shame and orgasmic pleasure. &quot;Uuuuuuh!&quot; As their dicks started to length from their already adult 4 1/2&quot; size to gargantuan pornstar proportions. They had a strong urge to rub their lengthening dicks but they were still wrestling. It wasn&#39;t until they felt that their balls suddenly dropped and hung out over the other hairy ones that they felt shame and stopped fighting.<br />
<br />
They stayed on the floor for a while checking their own bodies as well as checking the other one&#39;s until they felt their humongous cocks throbbing and they heavy bull balls hitting the cold ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;UUUUH! OH!&quot; They squeezed their packages only causing them to feel greater pleasure. They kept doing it, masturbating for their first time, until they started to feel a pressure build inside of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOH! Help me-UUUH!!&quot; Their cocks released a stream of thick white substance onto the floor in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH!!&quot; Ethan pounded on the floor as he screamed in pleasure, closely followed by Zach. They were now catching their breather from all of the excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Zach said in his deep manly voice as he panted on the floor. &quot;Ready for round two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always! Dumbass!!&quot; Ethan replied. &quot;And when I win I&#39;ll put my salami in that fat ass of yours!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be my salami which will be inside of your fat ass!!&quot; Zach replied but his previous aggressive tone had now changed to a more seductive one. How this will end between these former rivals?</p>
