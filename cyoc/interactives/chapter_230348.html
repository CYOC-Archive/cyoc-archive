<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN, THE AMUSEMENT SO FAR-(this sounds better with the song &quot;power of the night by Johnny steele&quot; for the back story here.) looking around in terror as you seen the gator and gorilla have been joined by other large animals for there were A kangaroo, a hippo, an eagle, a snake, a bear, an octopus even a T-rex that you quickly decided to be in a fight challenge of a four on on round match off against the crocodile, the kangaroo, a bear, and most impotently, the T.Rex. making this match as you even raised the stakes on who of them beats that by wining all the four round match offs is where you win the prize while it becomes lesser if you were to lose even one match, yet if you should to lose all the matches with the rule of default is where the ring mistress decides what you&#39;ll receive. while wishing for better wrestlers like the mighty lion, a tough honey badger, a proud tiger, and a wolf to name off a few that the audience of the crowd up roared and cheered on the match up you claimed as she approved of it and the crowd goes wild.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long after when the snake-man ushers you over and leads you off stage to the back area, where you were left in a locker-room that tells you to get change into what appears to be a wrestling singlet and closes the door. The singlet smelled like it&#39;s been used before with the musk of sweat and other scents clinging to the fabric that you wondered when it was last washed, still you didn&#39;t want to become a donkey or worse as you you did just as he told you while thinking about the match you just made. it was a tight fit, but slightly concerned about how little it covers your package while it preserves your modesty well enough as you didn&#39;t know any good wrestling moves is where you see a laptop that you soon Open it up to find some files on each of the wrestlers your facing for these footage and stats on each of the fighters to the ring was enough to watch a few matches on their style to come up with each strategy and counter each of their movements on how to win while deciding to spend the rest of the time warming up. some time later when the girl came into the locker-room with the snake-man, saying it was time for your first match and wished you luck with a smile and leads you back out into the arena to face off one of the four fighters that one fight after another as you&#39;ve been wining your wins upon each challenging fights.<br />
<br />
entering the ring was one thing as you&#39;ve even gotten to punish each one for your triumphant victory that the bear was the first while being carried offstage and a hurry and hefts you down a side hallway to what appears to be his dressing room and closes the door as his was to make you into a better fighter and to be your first wrestling league fighter starter up back at your place, keeping him for yourself to your future team in which you later call your family. the mistress did came in with the snake-man with a bag in hand, somehow knowing about what his punishment was as she told him pack up for he was fired when she glares at you madly that with a snap of her fingers is where the bear-man with his pack bag in hand had vanish from sight and he was shortly at your place while another bear-man simply moves right on in to take his place for this one was a grizzly type. second was the crocodile for the audience of the crowd up roared and quickly cheered on the match up you once claimed as the crowd was going wild that like before with the bear-man is where he too had hefts you up to carry you offstage for you were soon down a side hallway to what appears to be his dressing room with his scale-like arms and closes the door behind him for his punishment was like the bear&#39;s, to train you up to be a better fighter and later join up with the bear-man while becoming your second wrestling league fighter starter up back at your place to also keep him. you&#39;ve also mention to him that they&#39;ll maybe a third or fourth member joining later on to start building a large structure house for both you to live in, and a place for matches while to train as well for the snake-man and the mistress came in with a bag in hand. knowing what his punishment was while telling him to pack up as he was to fired from her service that like before, she glares madly at you that she now has an anthro black crocodile man to take his place and snapped her fingers while she sighed to see the gator-man with his pack bag of belongings in hand had vanished over to your place. the feeling of the two beast-man were going to be safe back home is where the new croc-man simply moves right on in to take the place of the old on while readying yourself to face with the mighty anthro Tyrannosaurs Rex, T.rex for short as he was also known by BFTP-Blast From The Past.<br />
<br />
it took you more than well over Fifteen minutes as this was the toughest fight you had for there were also see a few random items within reach of the ring, which were to spice up this round of the match that you later found his his scales did not make good enough efforts like before while each plowing each others hits on blow for blow. the girl of the match was shocked that he was ticked enough to take this match seriously to start using a hammer as you were back into a corner while looking for something to use when you randomly grab something to hit this T.rex wrestler with in the face, yet you were both surprised by this when what you shortly grabbed to hit him with was a.... a fish!? it did enough to knock the hammer out of his hands though as he fell face first into the ropes and shortly became tangled up in for his Face was towards the audience while his back to you, upside down you may add that T.rex soon had himself by you a wedgie of his life time. his eyes squinted shut in pain for when you landed back in the ring, after climbing up the ropes a little to grabbed a set of what were now the T.rex&#39;s shorts by now and jump back to pull down is when you hear a klink to glance down to see a pair of hand cuffs that Blast From The Past was nearly flashing his asshole to the audience at this point to Feel the humiliation and now felt ashamed in this fight with his eyes closed and was so red to even blush. since his legs were being kept forcefully spread by the ropes while trying to use his arms to cover his ass was nearly impossible for they weren&#39;t caught up in the rope as he did thought of his tail, but the tail wasn&#39;t long enough to do so for covering even his crotch when you gotten the idea that he felt you pulling on the belt to lash out at you with his tail. it just however put him in a tight situation of your trap for his tail was soon caught up in the belt while quickly using the cuffs to loop through the belt on his wrists as the belt was obviously made of a very strong, and stretchy material as the Rex realized he was lo longer in control of this match and squirmed to get free of the ropes for you Seek to add on to his humiliation that BFTP soon after gets untangled and manages to fall back into the ring to continue on.<br />
<br />
Getting angry by this now was when he manages to get onto his knees as he couldn&#39;t get his balance enough to stand up for his ass was just sticking up in the air that you later found something else to use on him and walked over to the T.rex wrestler with it while he was squirming with Eyes watering in pain, yet Once you were close enough to have him only hear you is when you whispered something to him. he whimpered quite a bit, but understood to what you said that he nodded his head as you felt so little resistance to reach down and stroke his cock from both the inside of his shorts by now and out for the audience seeing first hand at the action while he felt more pleasure than in pain to lost the will on fighting back with you for he began to moan. seeing that he was getting what he deserved by the reward from the audience is when you jump onto his back while driving his legs out from under him for one of his hands instinctively swings at you as it comes dangerously close to slicing you, but you did grab it in time before he did anything else. this got you Angry though that Getting a devious idea, you decided to grab the fish from earlier and start spanking him furiously with it for you did this a few dozen times to see him to be enjoying this to simply given up and just let you do what ever you wanted with him while Deciding it was long enough is when you step away from BFTP and pin him down for three seconds as you&#39;ve finally won this fight to hear the bell rang three times. winning your third match off is when a few doctors come out and took Blast From The Past backstage while the MC announced the winner of the match in surprisement one more that soon after, the girl approached you for she then leads you offstage and down a side hallway to what appears to be the rex&#39;s dressing room as you entered to have her closed the door behind you.<br />
<br />
having to see him on the bed while the doctors were checking to know if he was aright for one called her over as you&#39;ve over heard then saying that he&#39;ll be fine, but he won&#39;t be able to fight for quite some time while the other doctors left the room. heading over to give him his punishment while deciding on what it will be for you can tell he was really strong, yet somewhere deep down inside of him was a nice man as you&#39;ve expected him to be a bit kinky that when the doctor was done talking to her and left the room is when you soon told him what was going to happen to him on his punishment. after a bit of some conversation with BFTP is when you&#39;ve told him as for his punishment was from here on out that once was better is when it will begin. he&#39;ll be retiring for at least three to five years now as he&#39;ll also begin training newer wrestlers when they come for they&#39;ll also be turned into different types of other here, other then you of course that when he&#39;s well enough and back on his feet by then is where he can be with the others in no time at all while being ready to fight again. understanding by this outcome, know his wrestling time in the ring will have to be placed on hold for awhile as he felt sad about it that the two of you soon left his room while closing the door behind for a little chat while seeing he a bit surprised by this.<br />
<br />
she asked if you were interested on a little deal the girl was offering while you still had a match with the kangaroo wrestler ahead of you yet as you&#39;ve just gave BFTP some well deserved rest with some r and r time that thinking about it now was when she was soon gone for she went backstage. thinking about what she offer was would had to wait as you&#39;ve got ready for your final round and prepared yourself by heading over to the training gym, unaware of the kangaroo was already there and pumping up with training also for you approached to see the wrestling roo training aggressively by the punching bag that you could tell he was made at something while overhearing why from the distance of the Shadows. you over hear him as he couldn&#39;t believe this for his two friends lost to you that he mentioned the three of them promised of leaving the island together, until then is where they would all had to stay here while being her anthro wrestlers. he also said that if you should lose, then you&#39;ll be turned into an anthro wrestler yourself this was also his last fight for it was an all or nothing match at this point as he&#39;ll be able to finally leave this island freely. with a sad look on his face, he continued his speech as he didn&#39;t want to end up being sold somewhere to box while being completely changed into his feral form that he wish for someone to find him and help him out of this place to almost be in tears by now for this didn&#39;t feel right to you of him being someone&#39;s pet boxing roo to step out of the shadows and into the training room. he shortly after went off to train as you Find an empty spot next to him for you soon started to train with him, with a small chat while not making it obvious to what you&#39;re doing with him out loud from the others near by.<br />
<br />
telling to not to talk and just keep trying with you was enough for him to know something was up that he didn&#39;t even make eye contact with you when the girl from before sees you training with the anthromorphic kangaroo and shortly left, without saying a word as it was soon clear enough to speak for this was your only chance to tell him what&#39;s on you&#39;re mind while thinking of raising the stack higher for his last up coming match. begging the chat by telling to not blame you for taking his friends out of here without him as you&#39;ve offered to have him join the team of being the third member of the group that thinking about what you heard earlier from him, you&#39;ve mention this to him while pumping up some iron for his puts yours to shame to be working out with him to which no eye contacts were made for the moment. telling him that he&#39;ll not be turned into a feral animal as he&#39;ll be like he is while being treated well, with a tess of him being treated like a pet for unless he wants to. to this, he&#39;ll basically still be anthro with his friends back home as you&#39;ll be like a new father to him that he started to worry for if should you lose and begging to ask questions while sounding concerned on your safety now that you simply showed him this by giving a military like nod. just then, you both heard the man who turned donkey braying as you turn your gaze to him, even he was looking at this ass of a mule to which he mentioned he was somehow still in there for being a donkey to the human eyes while not quite understanding how he was able to talk with him that it was like he hasn&#39;t even been turned into an animal at all.<br />
<br />
what came next however, the roo-man asked on what were you going to do with him that he swiftly got off of his training and up over to the donkey for you didn&#39;t get a response from him till he was next to him as he then whispered something into his ear for it was for it was like he was wishing him luck on his last fight while not understanding this to feel a bit confused. tilting your head a bit to this on what&#39;s going on here while asking is when he shortly explained, saying that you&#39;re the one who&#39;s going to do with him as part of his earlier match&#39;s punishment for you soon had a thought of some use to him and told him what his punishment shall be. asking first if he wanted this punishment to be done on him as he was ready to accept his fate to be and nods a few times to approve of his decision that for his punishment though, he&#39;ll have to forget on ever being human to begin with for he&#39;s also your my third anthro wrestlers of the wrestling league start up fighters back at your home who loves a practical joke now a days who&#39;s also into cross dressing in a girly fashion getups. also telling him which from now on, he&#39;ll only remember what you&#39;re about to tell him as his family will know what happened to him while his former memories will slowly come back upon each day while liking your new life style, except from pleasure island here that he&#39;ll be trained by your two other wrestlers and into a better fighter. thinking that a donkey wouldn&#39;t do much for him is when you thought a stripped hyena would do better and told him this while also telling him that when you&#39;ve snap your figures together, he&#39;ll vanish from sight and reappear at your place to where he&#39;ll see the gator - man at work with the bear - man and to help them out as his things would pop up shortly after he arrived as he was  braying at you like crazy. Even though you didn&#39;t understand what he was saying that the kangaroo wrestler had to help translate for you as he was unaware of his transformation and was already changing into his useful form of a anthro stripped hyena wrestler for this is what he had to say in his brays, &quot;(You can&#39;t be serious!? You can&#39;t do this to me! Change me back right now! Haw-Haw-Hee-Haw!? Hee-haw-Haw-Hee-Haw-Hee! Haw-Hee-Haw-Hee-Haw!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a quick snap of your fingers is when he was soon gone as he was transported at your house that He saw two beast men of a bear and an alligator working on a building of sorts for he could remember why he was there, All he could remember right now though was this was his new home and he was your third wrestling league start up with them while he was soon enough helping them build. the roo-man started to think that maybe he was better off fighting with you than against you as he wondered if you had his back for the snake man entered, before you could answer him while the snake man tells you to get our butts in gear. he&#39;s been slithering around, looking for you both as he head on back to the ring within 5 minutes for he was panting out of breath and then slithered off once again that heading on out while chatting still is when you&#39;ve answered his question of having his back out there for he shuck hands with yours to say he dose and left the gym to enter the ring for the greatest fight of your life. you were both walked up to the ring from your training in the gym with this kangaroo-man that you wished to to fight off against something cooler like a mighty lion, a tough honey badger, a proud tiger, even a cool wolf for these were a few of the list of names to call off on as you did get a few starters of having now a bear-man, an alligator-man, and even a stripped hyena-man while hoping to save this wrestling kangaroo for your team off for this was where the fate of all fighting warriors lay it out on the line. after the announcements and Hoping up to your corner now that looking back to Red Jack&#39;s corner is when you wondered on how were you going to pull this off without fooling anybody as you both prepare to fight while hoping to see the out come of this match in one piece for you saw no fear out of him while knowing he wasn&#39;t like the three you fought before, There were no words to say when he knows you&#39;ve sent the two of his boys packing at your home for there punishment when your faces said it all.<br />
<br />
trying to hold back each of your fears in which was well kept hidden is when everything was on the line and at stack that the MC soon started up the match for nether one of you wanted to lose this match for one shall stand and one shall fall as the bell shortly rang for the match to start that Within moments, you were wrestling against one of the four beast-man left while not affording to be knocked out when he took a swing at your head for it was a miss for you&#39;ve given each a good blow for blow. he was moving so fast at the time for you were not what he hit you with most of them as they each definitely hurts...a lot that by the time you while Definitely feeling groggy now from his tail advantage, you&#39;ve made a comeback while giving him a really strong right uppercut to his chin. this landing a massive blow that you&#39;ve seen almost all of the Rock movies to know how this match will end up for you were almost out of strange to fight anymore, but just when he&#39;s peppering you with his right and left fury attacks of his fists is when the lights flickered green, red, blue, white, yellow, even purple while thinking something was up....and you were right. as the giant screen tv shows different anthro wrestlers for this also surprise the MC that On it were the white dragon looking wrestler with no wings (looks a little like shinning saber from in the land of leadale to be his name), a mighty black lion with a gorgeous beautiful red mane for it was well said with his red tufted tail, a muscular and beat up looking brown wolf (he looks more like a drawing of wolfali&#39;s your next!) And finally a blue shark for which they call him riptide for it was because of all those drawings of him in furaffinity and deviantart. The song was going off for them at the time was &quot;no more words (wwe edit)&quot; by endeverafter that he was distracted by what&#39;s going on is when you took this opportunity to sneak up behind him and grabbing to a bear hug lock as you then flipped him over for a back arch to have his shoulders touching the mate which Surprised him by this move and he was struggling to break free to even fling his tail around while kick in the air, but it didn&#39;t help him escape from your grasp much to have the referee started to slam the hand onto the floor for the count out....and your win.<br />
<br />
with the greatest wrestling league match off challenge finally over while the audience of the crowd was going wild upon your winning streak that you noticed something about him to know now he was actually a she while seeing the MC getting closer to place the collar on to be sold as a a feral boxing pet, yet you made your way over to Red Jack first for you were going to keep promise. telling her about the promise you&#39;ve made that the MC was stun to see what you&#39;ve said and done for you then told the audience about what her punishment shall be, the MC tried to intervene while she was more than past upset about this by now to the point of her getting boiling mad. exclaiming with confident that there are rules to follow as she&#39;s in charge of them as she was right about this, until you mentioned bets in which you&#39;ve made while in the gym with the kangaroo wrestler for she was then stun and paled by this to turn the snake-man and acknowledged everything he heard. This forced the MC to stand down from this as to the audience upon her faver to what the punishment of the kangaroo wrestler had planned on going in the first place that her punishment was for her to originally be sold off and be someone&#39;s pet boxing kangaroo in a feral form, but you&#39;ve changed this completely. tugging her closer for only her ears can hear as you&#39;ve Whispered in her ear while telling her of knowing of her being a tomboy female kangaroo for this was only the beginning to what you were going to do with her in which she deceived you by.<br />
<br />
privately punishing her in a whisper for you&#39;ve told her to remain at a female kangaroo wrestler fighter while being your first wrestling league fighter starter up diva as she was to secretly battle like she was, but with a small bonus of a boxing kangaroo joey hiding in her pouch that not even you know on how this idea came from and where you&#39;ve gotten this from while speaking to her of her motherly Instinct of keeping it and raising this young joey like it were her own child. although it won&#39;t age for it will mostly stay small enough to fit into her pouch as it&#39;ll be in there for when she go out boxing while it comes out most of the rest that the boys back home will take really good care of the young like they were each it&#39;s very own uncles, aunts if there&#39;s anymore girls around. it was true of knowing of her being once a man to when she got here as she&#39;ll be leaving here to what she is that she&#39;ll also remember her human memories before coming to the island while not controlling herself of wanting to be mounted by a kangaroo stud to which embarrasses her to blushing red for this, and yet she actually enjoy this for the boys back home would find out about her secret of being a female kangaroo wrestler sooner or later. should that day come, they&#39;ll probably want to have a go with her on having S...E...X. you also told her of having a strange fetish for that lion for she would think of him as her boyfriend crush.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve further her punishment for when it came back to this young joey of hers in which it was out of the pouch as she&#39;ll be in the ring of ether boxing to wrestling that everything around her would immediately turn her on while feeling like she was in heat, to feel this all the time upon seasonal days. she&#39;ll feel like this all the time as she&#39;ll need to cool down by doing one of the followings for it&#39;s the only way for her now that one was to have sex three times a day the morning to the afternoon hour to the night&#39;s bed time, second was to pleasure herself while being milked while the third was to go in the training gym area and train herself until she couldn&#39;t anymore, yet the fourth option was to restrain herself by being tied up into certain bondage items like a muzzle and a straitjacket to name a few to keep this bad girl style of hers in place. You then slowly remove yourself from her as you then made your announcement on her that you&#39;ve told the crowed you&#39;re going to claim her to be one of your own wrestling league fighter starter Ups while also telling them of her to tell you about the four wrestlers who were just seen on the screen, before she leaves back home with her supplies for when you arrive there.<br />
<br />
Red Jack asked if you were enjoying this and shortly told you about the four wrestlers as their group name was called &quot;The Out Lawers&quot; that the The white one was a dragon by shinning saber for the blue shark one was riptide while the beat up brown wolf boy there was what they&#39;ve been calling him fang when he&#39;s actually lupine when the black lion was given the name nightfire by the Mc. being told of being banished from the ring here as they&#39;re looking for employment who works in the ring in which you were in because of them being to popular for the crowd that she&#39;d fired them that she mentioned them being back stage while saying they had to be placed to work on A job of some sorts, before flick of your fingers to send her off back home. Once there that she felt something squirming inside her pouch as she shortly found out when a head popped out to find she now had a baby joey living in her pouch, her joey for she was going to be the best mom for her little one. Leaving the ring arena as you were now Walking around the backstage to meet up with Lupine the wolf, Nightfire the lion, Riptid the shark, and Shinning Saber the dragon that you felt confident enough to this point of meeting up with them for the first time in your life, yet One of the other wrestlers from the MC&#39;s staff wanted to speak with you as you wondered what this anthro wrestler wanted to talk to you about while also thinking on who this anthro was. thinking about it more as it could of been any one of the MC&#39;s staff for it could of been the MC&#39;s new crocodile-man, the new grizzly bear-man, the snake-man, the octopus-man, the gorilla-man, the hippo-man, not to mention the eagle-man, and the tyrannosaurus rex-men that you quickly saw the four and tailing up behind them as they were heading out to the ring arena while seeing what&#39;s up.<br />
<br />
you followed them out to the arena ring site, to where it all began as the MC was standing there in the middle of it all while holding onto the mic with one hand that entering into the ring for &#39;The Out Lawers&#39; shortly followed after words for you stood with Shinning Saber behind you with Lupine to your left and Nightfire to your right while Riptid was next to him for they each made a fiercing roar which it shook the audience with excitement to their knees. the MC congratulated you for a well fought match while being called a champion as she told you that you&#39;ve not only won second prize for it was a free trip to next years Pleasure island, but also the four anthro wrestlers. they were each stun to begin looking at each other, before turning back to look at you for you began to realize what the prize was as you&#39;ve turn back to face the MC again to make a curation on her part from seven to eight because of the donkey who turned into a anthro stripped hyena wrestler for one that the snake-man would conform all of this was truth and bowed his head while she mention a special great wrestling league match off challenge match for the two of you in which she made. people already signing up on the sheet to face off against some of both team&#39;s wrestlers that she has already chosen two of her fighters for this set up. even though it was a special match fight that they can also make it into a tag team match off which she to had chosen for her grizzly bear-man and her gorilla-man to enter in as she even made it special enough to have her snake-man to be her substitute for any of my two fighters, which the snake-man was surprised and stun to hear he was also in this match fight to even look... frightened.<br />
<br />
thinking it might be a good idea to have a few new wrestlers on the team that you&#39;ve agree to this as you noticed the snake-man was shacking and quivering in his boot first to wonder why to asked the MC for she wasn&#39;t telling you the hole story about what would happen if your team should loose as she kept evading the question. turns out that your hunch was correct as the MC told you the rest of the special match offs for the roles are simple, should your team wins off against each one of your fighters is where you and the team gets to punish like before on who should enter the ring while thinking to this could be just about anything you want. and yet, that&#39;s not without its flaw backs for should your side should lose also as the sign up sheet was shortly handed over to by the eagle-man in which you were figuring out who to sent into this match. the MC said she had six signed in for her team matches while yours were a group of three tag matches, and ten one on one single matches that are signed in for on your team as she was setting this up with in two days time while setting up your team on who faces who. shortly seeing the match sheet that only three of the one on one fights were for female as there was a tag fight with a girl in one of them too while the rest were for the boys matches group for you brought back both your kangaroo who was now called D.J. and your hyena who was now Kirdy to with a snap of your fingers, and a bit of a gender shift for him to which was only temporary at the time here.<br />
<br />
thinking it wold be best to have Nightfire the lion in the ring for the boys of a one on one while having him being in a tag match with Shinning Saber the dragon for two as you have D.J. tagged up with Kirdy the stripped hyena in a tag match that with Kirdy being in one out of the three matches is to have one girl problem which made things a lot easier, but having Shinning Saber entering one single match himself and D.J. entering one also now only left you with only seven other matches left to sort out. with only seven other matches left to sort out that Lupine didn&#39;t say who he was saying for it turned out his real name was Alex for one as he was also once a she before coming here by the name D.G. (Dorothy Gale) while thinking it would be best to call him Alex, Dorothy Gale to be shorten it to A.D.G. from now on, even if he thought it was better than being called Fido to later be explained on having him fight in three of the one on one rounds in which left only four matches to assign to against who knows who. having Kirdy the stripped hyena entering two singles left two spots as you&#39;ve made your choice for it was clearly obvious to have Riptid the shark for you thought of no one else for this that you&#39;ve told the gang of the group who&#39;s the last spot for the one on one singles fight.... yours truly. with the seating all set up on who&#39;s fighting where as the group for this also included you to rest up, work out while training, and more is when the two day flew by like you were having fun on a video game you like playing so much back home that it was soon time to begin the great wrestling league match off challenge specials. as you were with your team that believe it or not... you were ready to enter this fight.<br />
<br />
NOW-(the song power of the night ends here as it&#39;s time for the actual story to begin... NOW.) as you begin to enter the arena with your picked out team that the MC, the one who made this special league match off possible was already in the ring with her fellow wrestlers. though they would of been frightening to face off back then as they now don&#39;t seem that bad of fighting, but the snake-man was still looking worried while looking at you. shortly entering the ring, the MC started to speak int her microphone, to start the greatest wrestling league special matches.<br />
<br />
&quot;and here we are, folks! The great wrestling league special match off challenge, is here at last! we also have our very special guest here, The Out Lawers! Nightfire, the lion! and following with him are Lupine the wolf, Riptid the shark, and Shinning Saber the dragon! oh! and let us not forget our two fighters from a few days ago, ha!&quot; the MC spoke as they each made a fiercing roar that shook the audience with excitement to their knees, even you made a jestering wave while the MC then had to settle down the crowd before she spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;now then, not only do my team have six matches while yours have ten single matches with three tags that the matches are going to be special with of some few rules. one, all matches are genderized between boys and girls. two, some of the matches are from the audience in which will part take in the ring&#39;s fight as the losers shall be punished like the matches in the greatest wrestling league match off challenge. three should any person here be pregnant with an unbirth child before they enter the ring won&#39;t be punished as they&#39;ll be disqualified. four, there is no cheating within the matches of the ring like entering while the match is in place, bring in personal weapons of any sort, etc. and five, respect your opponent while giving it your all as there may be some miners here in the audience watching. now then, without thereafter ado, let the special matches... begin. fighters, at the ready.&quot; the MC said as she got most of her wrestlers on the stand by.<br />
<br />
you did save yourself from becoming doing some crazy jobs that would hire you to pay off your debt from her, even if you decided to come wrestle for her to pay it off for a week as it could of been even longer. still though, with sixteen signal matches with three tag matches that you know you have female fighters when she has none on her team. so how is going to pull this off against your team? unless she&#39;d plans to recruit a couple of girls to be her teams wrestlers for your team&#39;s tag match that she shortly announced the first match to be with...<br />
<br />
(oh boy! Well, this is it. things are starting to get hot in here now. the greatest wrestling league special match off challenge is about to begin as you now have a new team of wrestlers at the ready. However, You also wondered if the MC had anything to do with this that you might as well give thanks for the help of recruiting some new wrestlers. then again, what is she up to? if not however, then you wondered what will she do now as she begins to call out the first match. fell free to add you very own ideas as there are a few listed down below. Again, thank you and happy reading to this point of the tale.)</p>
