<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A wave of nausea flew through Ben’s body; his self-preservation instinct was beginning to go nuts. He was very angry with the man and slowly started backing off and cursed at the man.<br />
<br />
“You fucking son of bitch, how dare you do this to me! You’ll never get away with this!” he screamed. The man simply laughed and started walking towards him. Ben’s anger at the man increased exponentially and ran at the man and kicked him in the stomach as hard as he could. The man screamed and fell to his knees and Ben took the opportunity to run towards the door. The man struggled to rise and ordered the two women to stop him. Ben felt itchy and knew his time ran short. He reacted with instincts and remembered the martial arts training he had taken as a child.<br />
<br />
He ran up towards the first women and jumped up and kicked her in the head, sending her flying back into the wall and into unconsciousness. The other one ran at him and he did a roundhouse kick, hitting him in the stomach, knocking her to the ground. Seeing that she was still conscious, he jumped on top of her and punched her in the head, knocking her out.<br />
<br />
The itchiness in his body was spreading and he was beginning to feel dizzy. Everything starting looking fuzzy and he had trouble balancing himself. He pulled up his sleeve to see brown fur starting to grow on his arms. His ears started to ache. When he felt them, he discovered that they were growing longer.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” he cursed as he realized that this really was happening to him. The man picked himself up and mocked Ben.<br />
<br />
“Your time is running out Ben, it doesn’t matter what you do anymore. You’ll be braying in a matter of minutes. But your assault has condemned you to a much less pleasant fate.” he said as he pulled out a small device from his pocket and pressed a button on it to summon security.<br />
<br />
Ben noticed that his fingers were beginning to feel stiff and that his face felt funny. He screamed and ran towards the door just as two heavily armed security officers burst through it. Everything was starting to spin and he could see his face starting to get longer. He heard a ripping sound as a tail burst through the back of his jeans. <br />
<br />
“No!” he screamed as he fell to his knees. One of the men walked up to him while the other walked over to the man. The man standing over Ben simply laughed at him as he watched Ben’s humanity slipping away. Ben looked up at the man and saw him laughing. Even as his face began to elongate ad his fingers were getting thin, he still thought of a way to escape. What these people were doing to him angered him big time and he was willing to do anything to save his humanity.<br />
<br />
With a final effort, he stood up and kicked the man as he grabbed at his gun. The man’s grip on the rifle loosened just enough for Ben to snatch it from his hands. Ben slowly backed up and pointed the rifle at the man. The other security guard demanded that Ben drop his rifle, telling him that he would shoot him if he didn’t. Ben turned around and pointed the rifle at the man.<br />
<br />
“Go ahead shoot me, better to die a quick death by your hands then to live my life out as a fucking donkey!” he yelled. His fingers were getting even stiffer and it was becoming difficult to control them. He could hear the other guard approaching him from behind and felt now donkey ears twitching, he could feel hair on the back of his neck starting to grow into a mane, somehow it altered him to the approaching man. <br />
<br />
Without thinking, he turned around and pulled the trigger of the rifle, sending it’s buckshot into the mans chest, killing him instantly. As the man dropped lifeless onto the ground, Ben turned around to see the other man aiming. He tried to react, but he wasn’t fast enough. The other guard fired and struck him in the left shoulder, sending him flying back onto his back. <br />
<br />
Something was odd, such a blast should have been enough to take his arm off, but somehow his shoulder was mostly intact! It was not until he looked at his torso and saw that he was quickly gaining a massive amount of muscle and bulk. While it meant that his transformation was nearly completion, it has also saved his arm and possibly his life. He realized that he still had a hold of the rifle and didn’t take the time to think about what to do and let his emerging bestial instincts guide him. Without a second though, he aimed the rifle and shot the other guard in the chest. The guard was pushed back by the impact of the blast and was slammed against the wall where he fell lifeless face first onto the floor in a pool of blood.<br />
<br />
The man who had injected Ben looked him with a look of fear in his face. Ben could feel his fingers becoming near impossible to use and could see his face lengthening. With what little humanity he had left, he managed to pick himself up and pointed his rifle at the man.<br />
<br />
“Change me back or we both die here and now!” he demanded, planning on shooting the man and then turning the gun on himself before the transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
“Now why should I do that? You won’t be able to pull that trigger for much longer Ben. I hope you enjoy life as a donkey.” The man said as he began to laugh.<br />
<br />
Ben knew that his time was nearly up and decided to……</p>
