<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailey Meyers sighed as she now trudged back towards her room. Things had certainly taken an odd turn for the young woman. A month ago she was a college graduate desperately looking for employment. A fateful night out with her mother changed everything. Hailey and her mother were attacked, turned into vampires, and now she found herself training to be an agent within a secret government agency. <br />
<br />
&quot;You did good today kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey turned, her eyes resting on her instructor Cole Harris. Cole was a hulking former Marine, talked into joining S.P.E.A.R by a demon hunter named Jacob Moreland. Despite the former Marine s intimidating physique, Hailey found him to be quite friendly. &quot;Thanks Sgt Harris,&quot; she said softly. &quot;This is proving to be harder than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Director McMillan wants me to get you up to speed,&quot; Cole stated. &quot;She wants you trained just like any other federal agent just quicker. That means we have alot to cover in a very short time frame.&quot; Hailey nodded as the pair moved towards her room. As the newest and youngest member of S.P.E.A.R she was essentially a test case for how the agency would train their agents. Director McMillan wanted it run similar to other agencies, which Hailey understood. Consideing she was for all intents and purposes a homeless vampire, they had designed a portion of the building tobact as a dormitory. For Hailey, the academy felt like college again.<br />
<br />
Honestly the academic portion wasn&#39;t an issue, she had graduated in the spring with a 3.8 GPA earning a degree in computer science. It was the self defense courses that were proving to be taxing.<br />
Hailey had never been a very athletic person before becoming a vampire. Sure she went to the gym but she was no athlete. When she had been turned her physical strength, speed, and stamina had been increased, meaning she would be pushed hard physically. Now she was being put through the wringer, self defense courses, CQC training, firearms training. Hailey didn&#39;t know the first thing about guns, the first time she fired her weapon she let out a startled scream at how loud it was. Needless to say, that situation proved to be quite embarrassing. &quot;I just worry I&#39;ll fail,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I mean what are my options if that happens? I&#39;m a vampire, it&#39;s not like I can just go work at Walmart or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing fine trust me,&quot; Cole smiled. &quot;Academically you&#39;re on track and the physical stuff will come. Hell it took me sometime to become an expert.&quot; Hailey raised an eyebrow, critically looking over the massive ex Marine. &quot;How long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couple of weeks&quot; Cole replied sheepishly, rubbing his bald head. Hailey snorted, she had a feeling it would take her much longer. As the pair continued towards the room, Hailey spotted Jacob Moreland, the demon hunter furrowing his brow as he glared at her. &quot;He really doesn&#39;t like me,&quot; she shuddered. &quot;What did I do to make him so angry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not what you did but what you are,&quot; Cole stated. &quot;Jacob spent most of his life fighting vampires. He doesn&#39;t trust them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I mean I didn&#39;t do anything to him,&quot; Hailey exclaimed. &quot;And besides what did vampires do to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tore his arm off,&quot; Cole said flatly. &quot;And tried to kill him multiple times.&quot; Hailey paused, she hadn&#39;t known about Jacob&#39;s history. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Okay, maybe he has a reason but he seems to get along with Mrs. MacGregor. Heck you told me you&#39;ve had run ins with vampires too. Didn&#39;t a bunch of them try to kidnap your kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember telling you about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey blushed, now regretting poking into Coles personal files. She was at first very intimated by the man and wanted to know more about him. In doing so she found out about his family, his siblings, his service record, and what had transpired a little over a year ago when the vampires tried to kidnap his children. &quot;Okay maybe I did some personal research.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole smirked, watching the young woman turn several shades of red. When Sarah decided to bring her in, he was curious how the newly turned vampire would react. Hailey was a bit of an introvert and the last person you would think would join a law enforcement environment. Even now as a vampire, she remained unsure of herself. When the agency asked Marisa McGregor to evaluate the girl, they were surprised by what she said. Hailey was a rarity amongst vampires. A vampire, like Marisa herself, who maintained her humanity. Hailey didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone, the idea of drinking blood, even to survive, making the young woman gag. She didn&#39;t want to hurt people, making her an ideal candidate for S.P.E.A.R.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay yeah I can&#39;t exactly give a five star review to the vampires I&#39;ve met,&quot; Cole stated. &quot;But you&#39;re s bit different from them Hailey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah a loser vampire,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Vampires are supposed to be all big and bad. Drinking people dry and I&#39;m over here squimish just thinking about biting someone. If Mrs. MacGregor hadn&#39;t told me about the blood bank I probably would&#39;ve starved to death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didn&#39;t and the fact that you don&#39;t want to hurt people means you have some humanity left in you.&quot; Cole now smiled, placing a reassuring hand on Haileys shoulder. &quot;Look I know it&#39;s gonna take some getting used to.  Hell look at Mitchell and Rosario, they&#39;re still adjusting to being werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Hailey sighed. &quot;I just wish Jacob didn&#39;t look at me like he&#39;s thinking of different ways to kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give him time,&quot; Cole stated. &quot;Jacob&#39;s a good guy, he&#39;s just stuck in his ways. Eventually he&#39;ll come around. He&#39;ll still be thinking of five different ways to kill you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole stifled a laugh, noting the annoyed look on Haileys face. &quot;Oh ha ha very funny,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;You know just for that I&#39;m not taking it easy on you later for self defense class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting you too,&quot; Cole smirked. &quot;Finish up your work and get some rest. I&#39;ll see you in the gym in two hours.&quot; Hailey nodded, making her way into the room the agency had given her as Cole left. The young woman&#39;s life may have been turned upside down but it was proving to be an interesting turn of events.</p>
