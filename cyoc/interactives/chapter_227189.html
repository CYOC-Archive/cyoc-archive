<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Wake up, you stupid bastard!”<br />
<br />
You woke up to someone smacking you with a towel, using it as a whip. You took a second to gather your bearings: right, you had transformed into a dragon, lost control of your lust, devoured your roommate, blew them out as a hot load and went to sleep. Now you were being yelled at by…your roommate?<br />
<br />
“Ow, stop, what’s happening?”<br />
<br />
“What in the Hells were you thinking?” Julius’s voice thundered in the dorm room as he continued to whip you. “You’re a full dragon for less than a week and you decide to enslave me and turn me into your baby batter?!”<br />
<br />
“Ow, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, I lost control. Now stop hitting me!”<br />
<br />
The light turned on and you saw Julius standing naked next to the bed, wet towel in hand, absolutely furious. You noticed that the large decorative vase Julius kept on his side of the room was now gone, and the floor was covered in a puddle of something over where it was. The other puddle in the room had dried up while you slept, leaving a crusty white stain in the dorm carpet. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck, Cody?!” was all Julius could say, arms now folded in disapproval. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, really, I don’t know what came over me. I didn’t understand what would happen or what I could do.”<br />
<br />
“That’s because you didn’t bother looking up what dragon you were becoming until it already happened! And yes, I remember everything! Dammit, Cody, this is why you were supposed to study that beforehand! If I hadn’t had a clone prepped, you would have just killed me in cold blood!”<br />
<br />
A clone? Oh, that’s what must have been in the vase. You breathe a mental sigh of relief, glad that you hadn’t accidentally killed your roommate. He was right to be mad, you never studied until the last second, and on something important like this it was life threatening. You needed to figure out why you’d lost control and how to control yourself in the future. You sheepishly apologized to Julius, who was already casting a bunch of spells around the room. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, fine, I suppose you’re forgiven this time, if only because you didn’t know—even if you really should have. I’m making sure it never happens again, though!”<br />
<br />
The mage was casting multiple wards on both himself and you, as well as the room itself. He picked up his discarded and cum-soaked robes and used a spell to clean them. <br />
<br />
“At least you didn’t eat my equipment. Now stand up and let me inspect you.”<br />
<br />
“Inspect me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I want to make sure my wards are set properly and that I didn’t miss anything. I don’t intend on taking another trip down the ejaculate express.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Julius.”<br />
<br />
“I forgive you. Honestly I was never in any real danger. The university keeps clones of all students just in case something drastic like this occurs. Well, maybe not quite like this, but you get the picture. I just happened to have my own set up for practice. I didn’t think I’d have to use it, though. We’ll talk about how much you owe me for a replacement vessel later. Right now…”<br />
<br />
He walked around you, examining you, casting more spells, using strange items. You really were impressed with how skilled Julius was. You were a slouch when it came to anything magic, but even most other guys in your cohort who knew what they were doing couldn’t pull off magic at the level that Julius could. He was exceedingly gifted, perhaps why he had been chosen as your roommate, hoping that he would be a good influence on you. <br />
<br />
“…Interesting.”<br />
<br />
“What is?”<br />
<br />
“You seem to have absorbed my magical energy when you consumed me. Your magic potential is even higher now than before.”<br />
<br />
“I stole your magic?”<br />
<br />
“Well, not permanently, thanks to the clone spell, but yes, all the magic that was in my old body is inside you now. That explains why it took more mana to cast those wards than I was expecting. That’s why I wanted to make sure they were applied properly. They should be good, I just had to cast them at a more potent level than I was expecting. Now I shouldn’t have to worry about you hypnotizing me with your dick.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t apologize enough for that, I didn’t mean to violate you like that.”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, it uh…well, honestly…that part wasn’t so bad. The digesting me into cum part was not appreciated.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…you liked having sex with me?”<br />
<br />
“Um, well…yeah, actually. I guess I never told you that I’m gay, it hadn’t really come up before, and as I understand it you were straight before the change. It was pretty hot though, and not to be rude, but you look way more attractive as a dragon.”<br />
<br />
“Understandable,” you admit, knowing that your previous overweight slob lifestyle wasn’t doing you any favors for attracting either gender. “I guess…I’m just glad you liked it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t get me wrong, it was fantastic. But I’d prefer it if I was willing next time.”<br />
<br />
“…Next time?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah, I’m not opposed to doing that kind of stuff with you again, just, on my terms, y’know?”<br />
<br />
The two of you looked at each other, both blushing. Neither of you was sure where to go from here, but your new dragon half took over again, making you lean your serpentine neck down and go for a kiss. Julius hesitated a moment, still rattled from earlier, but quickly gave in and returned the affection. Your lips locked and the two of you held the kiss for a moment before breaking away and staring at each other uncertainly again.<br />
<br />
“Um, you’re really attractive, Julius,” you tell him. “And you’re super talented and supportive of me, even though I was a crappy mage and a shitty dragon. I know I was out of line earlier, but if you can forgive me, I uh…I’d like to try being with you for real.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, um, you know? I think I might like that, actually. But we definitely need to work on your control before we can do anything like what happened earlier again. If you’re willing to study and work towards controlling yourself, though, I’d be happy to be your partner.”</p>
