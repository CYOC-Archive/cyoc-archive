<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary probably would have continued playing for hours, if she hadn&#39;t seen the woman watching them from a bench outside the enclosure.  Embarrassed, Mary slowly walked to the gate trying to avoid her gaze. To her horror, the woman followed her to the gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t mind me. I think that&#39;s the most fun Max has had in quite a while, &quot; the woman said as she walked up to Mary. <br />
<br />
She was short, around 5&#39;3&quot;, and of Asian descent. Her dark hair framed her pale face quite nicely, stopping just past her shoulders, and her warm brown eyes caught the light of the morning sun. She wore a simple outfit comprised of an unzipped black windbreaker over a black tank top and a dark gray pair of leggings that clung tightly to her slim legs. On her feet were black and white checkerboard Vans slip-ons, white ankle socks peeked out from in the insides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max? &quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Max is the dog you&#39;re having some much fun with. I&#39;m responsible for him&quot;, she said with a smile. As Mary continued to walk to the gate, Max followed her, jumping around her and occasionally barking. It was obvious he was enjoying the game and didn&#39;t want it to end.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said sheepishly. &quot;I wasn&#39;t trying to steal him or anything. I just saw him alone out here and I thought he needed some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem, &quot; she said. &quot;I should actually be thanking you. We&#39;re not supposed to leave dogs unattended out here. I had just dropped Max off when I got kind of an emergency call, and I had to run over to my apartment to take care of it&quot;. She pointed to the apartments nearby, where Mary also lived. &quot;You look familiar. Do you live around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary remembered the woman. She lived on the same floor as her, and Mary thought she was very attractive. But she never found the courage to ask her out. &quot;Yes, we live in the same building.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, now I remember,&quot; said the woman. &quot;My name is Jane, by the way. Jane Chang.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mary, &quot; she said. She had reached the gate, opposite Jane. She extended her hand, and Jane shook it.<br />
<br />
Jane though that Mary was cute too, and had thought about asking her out herself. However, she had just been too preoccupied with work lately for any other kind of relationship. Besides, when she had occasionally seen Mary in the hallway, she seemed a little cold and distant, avoiding eye contact. Meeting her up close now, she realized that she was just really shy. Before Jane shook her hands, she hadn&#39;t noticed how oddly shaped they were. Mary&#39;s fingers seemed kind of short and stubby, and the fingernails were long, thick with a slight black sheen. But she was a nice girl, so Jane tried not to stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your emergency?&quot; Mary asked. Max continued to pace around her. Occasionally, nuzzling or licking her hand. He did not want her standing at the fence talking. He wanted to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was a work thing. I work as a vet for a living, but sometimes I also do part-time work as a dog sitter and trainer - for dogs like Max,&quot; she said, gesturing towards him. &quot;One of my other clients is having a lot of problems with their dog, and they needed some immediate advice.&quot; <br />
<br />
As if on cue, her phone began to ring. &quot;Not again. Probably Max&#39;s owner this time. Sorry we are going to have to leave. Come, Max.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, but obediently, Max walked to the gate and allowed Jane to put on his leash. Mary leaned over to Max&#39;s face to say goodbye, and scratched his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Max, it was the most fun I&#39;ve had for a long time, too.&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly, Max began to lick her face, occasionally getting his tongue in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heel, Max, heel,&quot; said Jane as she pulled Max away. &quot;Sorry about that. He&#39;s still being trained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; said Mary, a little dazed. Her face felt a little funny. She was wondering if it had something to do with the potion. I better get home, too, she thought, and quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for your help, &quot;said Jane. &quot;I really owe you one. If you come over sometime, I promise I will make it up to you. And, of course, if he hasn&#39;t been picked up yet, you can always play with your friend here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might just do that,&quot; said Mary with a smile. She turned and looked to the apartment complex. Jane noted that she appeared a little anxious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know where I live. Come over anytime,&quot; said Jane with a warm smile. She turned and walked back to the apartment complex.<br />
<br />
Mary retrieved her hat from the enclosure, and exited the pen. She looked at her feet; they appeared even longer now, and her toes appeared thick and short. Her nails were much thicker, slightly curved, and appeared to be covered in black nail polish. There was no way her sneakers would fit now. She grabbed her shoes and quickly ran home, curious to see what other changes were in store for her.</p>
