<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, here we go again&quot; he said under his breath. Jeff walked casually from his bedroom into the bathroom again, his chest began to tingle and itch mildly. he began to scratch his chest, he looked down and became alarmed- tiny hairs had appeared in the center of his chest. The tiny hairs began to spread across his pecs and immediately began to darken. <br />
<br />
They were not visible in the mirror- ...yet, but he noticed something else, hairs on his chin, small hairs, and they were becoming more and more visible, very rapidly. He leaned over into the mirror closely examining his chin. He watched intently as each hair began to grow and thicken, it darkened and spread, He moved his fingers across the hairs, a small mass of dark hair had now overtaken the bottom of his chin, and it was quickly moving down and his neck. The fine hairs were smooth and short, but he felt them grow longer under his fingers, &quot;bizarre&quot; he said quietly.<br />
<br />
He stepped back for the moment, he was confronted with a changed reflection. Hair on his chest was now visible, thin hairs, all across his chest had lengthened considerably and were now visible, not thick by any means, but visible from a few feet away, but more shockingly, his stomach! his once thin happy trail had grown into a huge patch which now dominated his whole stomach. The hair, very dense up the center of his stomach, thinned out as the hair moved up and away from his stomach.<br />
<br />
This was different, much different, and it seemed he couldn’t pull his eyes away for a moment or he wouldn’t be able to watch the changes. His chest was now more densely hairy, and his face! it was covered with hair! he almost had a full beard, it was a bit patchy in places, but his sideburns had grown in, thick too. and hair now extended down and across his neck. He was hairy now. Even his eyebrows seemed thicker and heavier.<br />
<br />
His arms, how they had changed in appearance, hair had, of course, thickened dramatically there too. making his arms darker looking, and more masculine. His legs hadn’t changed as much, but they were noticeably hairier. The timer was now down to 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
9....8...7...6...<br />
<br />
&quot;God, what’s happened to me?!?&quot; ...3..2...1   <br />
<br />
he heard a quiet beep in the other room.<br />
<br />
He stared on at his reflection, hair all over his chest. He wasn’t extremely hairy, but for his age.... he really, really very hairy.<br />
<br />
And he had a beard! it had grown a good inch and a half long, his full beard. &quot;incredible&quot; he muttered as he stroked it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;man, i wonder where we the keep razors...&quot;<br />
<br />
He thought about his dad's electric shaver, he'd never used one, he wasn’t sure what to do with it... but unless he wanted to keep the beard, and he didn’t, he needed it. <br />
<br />
Jeff was thinking about going up stairs, but how could he do that looking like this? what if he was caught? what if one of his parents came home? it was 5:30 by now, his dad or mom would be home any minute.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked into his bedroom, still unable to believe what had just happened, and walked over to his dresser and pulled out a shirt. <br />
<br />
He put it on, but he could feel something incredible, the hair under his shirt, it felt so strange, as he moved he could feel the hair on his chest brush against the fabric of his shirt. &quot;I’m gonna have to get used to this.&quot; he said aloud. <br />
<br />
He took a final glance at the mirror in his room and headed up the stairs, passing the garage, and then passing the living room. 'good thing jesse isn’t home' he thought, 'he must be over at one of his friend's houses again. But he was still nervous, he'd have to get past his sister, who was still in the house... <br />
<br />
He made it to his parent's bathroom, his sister must have been preoccupied in her room, with the door closed. thank god. The razor was staring at him now. He turned it on and it made a loud buzzing sound. looking into another mirror, it was still so strange to him, he looked so incredibly different, older...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit... what if Lisa sees the Chronovac on? shit! what if she sees me doing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
just then, he heard something....</p>
