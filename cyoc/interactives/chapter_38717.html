<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle was happy. School had been good, Tommy had asked her out and the prom was only two months away. Oh yeah, she was happy.<br />
<br />
Michelle was your average sixteen year old girl. Worried about her looks, size six waist was just so fattening and her B cup size breasts were just to small, trying to remember when her monthly was last, and whether or not she was passing school and whether the hot boy, Tommy liked her or not; which he did.<br />
<br />
Yup, she was just your average sixteen year old girl. She woke up, got dressed for school, it was a rich private school and required a uniform, received her morning shot, Michelle got two of those, one in the morning and one after dinner and when she asked what they were for, her mother only told her that she would explain when she was older, probably when she was twenty one, and caught the shuttle bus to school.<br />
<br />
It was just outside the school, which didn't start for another hour and a half, that she saw Tommy ducking into an arcade that dated back to the eighties. Calling out, &quot;Tommy,&quot; Michelle  chased after him.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside, she found herself in a dim atmosphere and all around she could hear the clinks and pings of video games. After her eyes adjusted, she saw Tommy standing by a claw machine. Walking over, she put her arms around his waist and greeted him.<br />
<br />
Tommy twisted and turned before finally turning about. Seeing Michelle, he kissed her and replied, &quot;Morning gorgeous. I've never noticed this place before. Have you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle shook her head and Tommy turned back to the claw machine. Inserting a quarter into the slot, he asked, &quot;What say we try and win a beautiful prize for my beautiful girl,&quot; and began to move the claw over the various prizes.<br />
<br />
It took him three quarters before he won something. Pulling it out of the prize bin, he handed it to Michelle and said, &quot;This is for you. Maybe I could buy you some perfume to put in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle giggled and told him, &quot;That would be nice,&quot; and then kissed him again. Across the street, the first bell rang and the two ran out holding hands, giggling about something and hoping they weren't caught truant.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Michelle sat down in the library. It was after school and she had a couple hours before she was due home for dinner. From her bag she withdrew her homework. She was just about to close the bag when she noticed the bottle Tommy had won for her. Taking it out, she studied it very carefully.<br />
<br />
It appeared to be really old, but she wasn't sure of how old. Tilting the bottle this way and that, she thought she saw something move about. Thinking it might be liquid, she looked about and then breathed a sigh of relief when she saw no one in this section of the library.<br />
<br />
Grasping the cork, she began to pull.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Andrew was aware that someone had the bottle, just not who. He'd tried to scream for help and then to warm them not to open the bottle, but this was difficult due to the fact he had no corporeal form. Suddenly there was an audible pop and the purple smoke that was Andrew began to billow out.<br />
<br />
Andrew was at first happy to be out of the bottle, but all that turned to horror as he saw before him a beautiful sixteen year old girl. As she began to turn to purple smoke, he, now she, exclaimed, &quot;No, no, no! Anything but a girl!&quot; and then seeing the horrified look upon the poor girl's face, offered, &quot;I'm sorry. If I can, I'll try and fix all this,&quot; as way of apology.<br />
<br />
It took only a matter before the girl was encased in the bottle that once housed Andrew and before that a Djinn. Picking it up, Andrew set it on the table. Looking down he saw a purse and backpack. Figuring they belonged to the girl, Andrew picked them up.<br />
<br />
From the table he took the homework and slid it into her backpack and then placed the bottle into the purse. A strange noise from the abdomen of this body gave Andrew pause and he thought, &quot;Oh god. This girl isn't having her period, is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
A bought of cramps flashed across her abdomen and Andrew doubled over in pain. As the pain in her gut slowly spread throughout her body, a spike of pain stabbed into Andrew's brain and memories of this young woman's life began to over take his. But this was only the half of it as the pain in her abdomen quadrupled, causing Andrew, who now knew that this girl's name is Michelle, to crumple to the floor.<br />
<br />
Without really thinking about it, Andrew, now Michelle, rolled under the table, glad for the darkness that was brought on by a table clothe dropped over the table and the libraries low lights. Reaching a hand out, Michelle pulled her purse and book bag under the table with her.<br />
<br />
Curling up into a ball, she could only go deep into her mind as the pain that coursed through her body brought her nearer and nearer to unconsciousness. The last thing she saw before her eyes closed was her hand reshaping so that she only had three fingers and a thumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;My god, what is wrong with this person, err me,&quot; Andrew asked herself as she drifted off into unconsciousness.</p>
