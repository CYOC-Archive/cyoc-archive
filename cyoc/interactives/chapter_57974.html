<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A sharp ringing woke Kelly from her deep sleep. She was to drowsy to see anything clearly, so she just fumbled around under her bed until she found the phone. Mashing what she thought was the answer button, she put the phone to her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; She asked, trying to sound awake as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, is this John's phone?&quot; A male voice asked, Kelly instantly recognised it as Harry.<br />
<br />
'Oh shit!' She thought, suddenly wide awake. &quot;Yup, he is in the shower at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At 6am? Okay. Who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Crap. Crap. Crap!' Kelly thought, her mind scrambling for an answer. Desperately, she blurted out the first one that came to mind. &quot;I'm his girlfriend, Kelly.&quot; She had no idea why she chose that answer over all others - it had just come naturally to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I can't believe he didn't tell me that! Alright, bye...&quot; Harry almost sounded offended, making Kelly feel unnaturally guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! I - uh, I mean John wants you to come around after school, bring the others too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Harry sounded a little happier as he hung up then.<br />
<br />
A knock came from his bedroom door. &quot;Kelly.&quot; Louis whispered through the wood. &quot;You package just arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a flash Kelly had opened the door, tearing the large cardboard box from Louis' hands and placing it down on her bed. The box was already open, but Louis said she had snuck a peek inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a few very cute outfits in there Kelly - they will suit you brilliantly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bit by bit, Kelly pulled out the contents of the box. First came a toiletries bag complete with a toothbrush, toothpaste a hairbrush, some moisturiser, a bottle of shampoo, a fluffy body washer thing and a packet of tampons. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think I'll need those, do you?&quot; She asked fearfully, but Louis could only shrug.<br />
<br />
Next came a small, pink briefcase that, when opened, revealed dozens of different make-up accessories. It all looked very daunting, but Louis' hand on her shoulder reassured her.<br />
<br />
Next came a violet blue silk nightie. Kelly rubbed the fabric on her cheek and smiled, loving the feeling of it. She could only imagine how good it would feel to wear it. Next came a bra and panties of the same violet blue colour, both with frilly patterns that left some parts concealed and others not so much. Louis' hand tightened a little.<br />
<br />
Finally, folded neatly at the bottom, was the cute little outfit that Louis must have been talking about. It was simple - just a pale green singlet and some tight jeans, but Kelly knew that they would be a perfect fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was there a note or anything?&quot; She asked, looking over her shoulder at Louis.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. There was just a knock on the door and this plain cardboard box on the doorstep. Now how about a shower, I'll help you get ready - and then we can head to the mall? Does that sound fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Kelly replied, confused at this sudden warmth Louis was expressing. She never wanted to spend this much time with John, but now that he was a she, she seemed to have suddenly taken a huge liking to her.<br />
<br />
Stripping off the poorly fitting clothes, Kelly stepped into the adjacent bathroom and made to close the door, but Louis stopped her. &quot;You get started dear, I'll be back in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Kelly showered, feeling the warm droplets of water peppered her new, supple body, Louis walked in and out, bringing in items from her own bathroom, like her hair straightener, a hairdryer and a chair from the dining room. While she did that, Kelly turned her back and let her hands roam. Her breasts, felt so soft and malleable, they were like putty in her hands, and when she touched them a warm tingling spread through her body. She liked the sensations she felt when touching her nipples, but was afraid to go any further while in the presence of her foster mother, so moved on, running her hands down her curvy midriff. She slipped a hand between her legs and gingerly probed the tight slit that was her vagina. A slight gasp escaped her lips as an even stronger tingling sensation emanated from her womanhood. Feeling suddenly bolder, she probed deeper, pushing her fingers in the whole way. The pleasure increased and she closed her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly!&quot; Louis shrieked, scaring Kelly so much that she almost fell over. &quot;Get out here now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a child caught stealing from the cookie jar, she did as she was told. As soon as she was out, she was trapped in a tightly wrapped towel and firmly sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I know this is a strange experience for you, but for this week I expect you to treat your body as any real woman would - with dignity and respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly was blushing furiously, unable to contain her embarrassment. Louis continued to rant and Kelly surprised herself by sniffling. Tears began to inexplicitly well up behind her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't cry, darling!&quot; Louis cooed, suddenly becoming very motherly.<br />
<br />
Kelly didn't understand why she was suddenly so sensitive. She hadn't cried since she was thirteen, and all of a sudden - at a slight chastising - she was ready to start blubbering.<br />
<br />
&quot;I - I think this whole experience has just worn me thin.&quot; She told Louis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, well let's forget about this whole thing, shall we?&quot; She suggested, wiping the tears from Kelly's eyes. &quot;Let's get on with your lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis then set about rigorously drying Kelly before plugging in the hairdryer and handing it to the newly made girl. She told her what to do and Kelly took to it instantly. As she watched herself in the mirror, Kelly realised she looked like she had been doing this for years.<br />
<br />
After she was all dry, Louis got the hair straightener and began to teach Kelly about hair. By the time her hair was dried and styled, Kelly was beginning to understand what Louis was talking about last night. Though she wouldn't say anything, she actually felt really good about her hair - how it went dead straight to her shoulders down the sides and back, and at the fringe it cut across her hairline from left to right so that it framed her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go.&quot; Louis said, handing her the blue panties.<br />
<br />
Kelly slid them up her smooth, hairless legs until the rested snuggly in her crotch. She liked the feeling of how they fit so well with the shape of her body. Next Louis taught her how to put on the bra and helped her clasp it at the back. Once again, Kelly took to it like she had been doing it for years. Looking at herself in the mirror, she knew she looked amazing. The bra felt so comfortable, supporting her breasts and even pushing them up slightly. An urge came over her then and she struck a sexy pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Louis muttered. &quot;Every girl on the block is going to be envious of you.<br />
<br />
This inspired a giggle from Kelly, who instantly covered her mouth with her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright dear, that's just your laugh. Now for the make-up.&quot;<br />
<br />
To Kelly's surprise, the two of them talked just like two school girls as Louis did her make-up. It all came naturally to her now. The talkativeness, the giggling, she even felt excited when Louis mentioned shopping.<br />
<br />
After half an hour, Kelly was standing in front of her mirror, looking at the new her. She had been utterly transformed since 6am that morning. Her eyes were darkened with eye shadow, his cheeks had foundation on them, her lips were glossy with pink lip gloss. She loved the way her light green singlet just revealed the edges of her bra, and the tightness of the jeans. She even loved the pair of heels - that Louis has supplied given they were the same foot size - and the way they made her look taller. Louis had been right the night before, Kelly now felt totally feminine and was loving it - her confidence was through the roof.<br />
<br />
She giggled as she turned to Louis. &quot;let's hit the town then, shall we?&quot;</p>
