<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This segment contains mild non-con and a super-mild spoilers for a plot-point in Aliens: Resurrection (1997).  Otherwise, it is what it says on the tin.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><em>Just after they entered the &#39;cabin&#39;... ———————————————</em><br />
<br />
...Matthew looked up and around the three story main lobby of this rustic hotel.  There was hardwood flooring for most of the place, with streamers of black, blue, and silver hanging from the rafters and lit by two chandeliers.  Down on the floor against the far wall was not one but two fireplaces.  Between them, a wide set of double-doors that lead outward to the back patio that overlooked the lake.<br />
<br />
The main room had a number of couches and chairs, each with hardwood end tables between them.  All through the space were a number of columns holding up the roof, each with little sudo candelabra with flame-shaped white lightbulbs within.  There were long windows along the far wall, and up above were walkways for the second and third floor that were each connected down into the main room by a spiral staircase.<br />
<br />
Looking to a sign on the wall just beyond the main desk, Matthew took in the directions on the big map there.  It looked like there two double-wings, to the north and south, with west and east hallways, triple-stacked.  &quot;Holy shit, guys... this place didn&#39;t seem this big from the outside,&quot; which was true.  Now that everyone was inside, the cabin had shifted its features.  &quot;Look at this,&quot; he pointed.  &quot;ten rooms up one hallway, two hallways on each side of the lobby, three stories of rooms... that&#39;s, what, a hundred and twenty rooms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and?&quot; Eric asked, a long black-furred feline tail out behind him as he moved.  The boy had already shrunk an inch, but that didn&#39;t make him short at 5&#39;11&quot; now... simply that he&#39;d noticed it compared to others.  That tail swished as he pushed the point.  &quot;I take it you&#39;ve never been to a big multi-story hotel before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Course I have,&quot; Matthew grumbled.  His fluffed up brown deer tail at his back with little spots of white over the top and a full white color underneath had escaped from being tucked under his shirt again.  &quot;I just... didn&#39;t expect something like this to be in a state park.  It&#39;s just so weird, right?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh,&quot; Ahmed shrugged.  &quot;Been in much nicer, less loggah locations,&quot; he spoke with the easily misplaced accent.  Eric stood in front of the map of all of ten seconds before turning and walking towards the wall where an old-design, wood and steel elevator with Francis and Lukas close behind.  &quot;And where are you tree goin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pool&#39;s one floor down.  It&#39;s gotta have locker room with showers, yeah?&quot; the black-haired young man asked, looking back to Ahmed and Matthew by leaning over the steel frame of the elevator.  It wasn&#39;t walled and you could see and hear the chains jangle as Eric stepped onto it.  &quot;Need I remind you that this was a <i>black shirt,</i>&quot; he said, pulling his cum-covered, white-plastered shirt up from his torso with an audible sticky sound as is slowly separated from his skin.<br />
<br />
Everyone in earshot sort of winced a the nasty noise.  Matthew just shook his head.  &quot;Fair point,&quot; his said as the elevator dinged, and started to move.<br />
<br />
Matthew glanced at Ahmed, then down at his own not-supposed-to-be-white shirt and pants.  Looking to the tan-skinned wide receiver, they both heard Eric call out &quot;Carolina <b>[Panthers]</b>!&quot; followed by a brief pause and then a follow-up: &quot;You asked me <i>why</i> I was a <i>kitty</i> and not a <i>wolf</i>... and you asked me back <i>before</i> what my favorite NFL team was!&quot; he said, clearly responding to either Lukas or Francis, neither of which were speaking loudly enough to hear.<br />
<br />
Stepping away from the entrance, Mathew and Ahmed started walking towards the elevator, the only in the building, when Coach Banks stopped them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys,&quot; he said in a tone that sounded like he thought they were up to no good.  He winced for a second, fully expecting Zelda to repeat &#39;boys&#39; from behind him, but when he glanced over his shoulder, she was talking with her friends at the front desk.  Turning his head back to Matthew and Ahmed who had stopped a few feet from the elevator he said: &quot;I want you all where we can see each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wet all due respect,&quot; Ahmed said, looking his coach in the eyes.  &quot;We didn&#39;t just have a gay orgy because we weren&#39;t supervised, coach,&quot; he said flatly.  &quot;Maybe in my dreams, but not for real,&quot; he added, unnecessarily, reconfirming his own homosexuality.  &quot;Matthew for one is the most uncomfortably straight guy I know,&quot; he thumbed at his teammate.  &quot;It&#39;s literally taken magic for him to give me a—&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew furrowed his brow, then interjected: &quot;The fu— <i>heck</i> is &#39;uncomfortably straight&#39;?&quot; he enquired, doing finger quotes in the air. Coach Banks nodded as Ahmed&#39;s remark anyway with a smile.  <i>&quot;Why</i> are you <i>nodding?&quot;</i>. Somewhere nearby, an awake Jessica, his girlfriend, laughed.  &quot;Seriously?&quot; he wondered, looking over to her sitting on a couch with two other girls.  She just turned to look at him, met his eyes, smiled, shrugged, then looked back to her conversation.<br />
<br />
Coach Banks just smirked and looked to the tanned young man.  &quot;You&#39;re point, Ahmed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, Francis, and Lukas went for the showers to get cleaned up,&quot; he explained.  &quot;So either we need to go get them for you because you&#39;re worried they&#39;re going to have a &#39;shower scene&#39;... or you could just, like, give us fifteen-twenty minutes to join them and get cleaned up so we don&#39;t smell like cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Banks groaned.  &quot;Young adult or not, I don&#39;t want to hear my team talking about cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Semen?  Ejaculation?&quot; Ahmed asked.  Matthew chuckled, but also blushed a little, thinking lewd thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Semen, I guess,&quot; Coach Banks grumbled.  &quot;OK.  Twenty minutes, and soak your cloths.  No &#39;shower scene&#39;, no pranking.  If there&#39;s enough shower-heads I want you each at least one apart and definitely resist the urge to approach others if there another one of these &#39;lust wave&#39; things Heather thinks happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew raised a finger to the Coach.  &quot;Hey.  Why don&#39;t you have a tail, anyway?  Wouldn&#39;t doing the whole &#39;say an animal&#39; thing mean the lust wave&#39;d hit you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personal, medical issues,&quot; Coach Banks assured him without giving any more details than that.  Matthew raised an eyebrow, while Ahmed tapped him on the shoulder.  &quot;Maybe higher willpower than teenagers?&quot; he pondered aloud.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Plenty of the other adults weren&#39;t hit with a lust wave, I don&#39;t think.&quot;  He sighed, relenting to the question at hand, &quot;Whatever the case: Twenty minutes... no more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; Matthew confirmed loudly, giving a faux salute.  He and Ahmed then turned to wait on the one elevator to come up a floor.<br />
<br />
The elevator was slow to leave, slow to arrive, but when it finally showed up, it locked into place, and the front gate opened.  Ahmed and Matthew stepped onto the elevator.  As it started to descend, the brown-skinned Ahmed looked to Matthew.  He ran a hand through his messy black hair and shook his head at the white boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Matthew asked as the singular light on the elevator was all they could see from for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Banks had testicular cancer in his thirties, dude,&quot; said Ahmed.  &quot;You know that.  &#39;Medical Issues&#39;, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew raised an eyebrow.  &quot;You think he&#39;s not as affected because he has only one ball?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think <i>he</i> thinks that,&quot; Ahmed said.  &quot;As for me, I&#39;m having simultaneous issues believing this is happening at all, wrapped up in the undeniable images of everyone&#39;s tails and also <i>Ted&#39;s fucking face</i>.&quot;  He shivered.  &quot;Wolf muzzle, nose and all, but fur into hair and human ears and eyes... like one of those mis-matched creatures in sci-fi build or bread wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking the room of Ripley clones from Resurrection,&quot; Matthew admitted.  Ahmed raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Aliens: Resurrection?&quot; he asked.  Ahmed nodded at that, understanding the reference now.  &quot;When the rain stops, probably in the morning, I say we go hunting for an exit.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;Also, &#39;fucking face&#39;.  Good one,&quot; he smirked, finger-gunning at him.<br />
<br />
Ahem rolled his eyes.  &quot;Rain&#39;s already stopped anyway,&quot; he added as they walked up the hall passed a laundry room, the snack machines, a single bathroom, and onwards towards the pool and changing rooms.  &quot;Just a moment after the last person came inside... cloudy sky, no lightening, no rain,&quot; he said.  &quot;I was watching the windows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew took a breath.  &quot;Well, shit.  I don&#39;t really want to go into the woods at night... that seems way dumber than doing it during the day,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Ahmed nodded.  &quot;Normally I&#39;d call you a wuss, but... you right.  I ain&#39;t doing that shiz either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew quickly put a finger up to his lips.  &quot;You hear that?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The showers?&quot; Ahmed queried.  &quot;Yes, I hear that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, listen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahmed leaned forward a little when Matthew took his finger from his lip and pointed towards the locker room up ahead.  Like the upstairs bathroom, it appeared to be unisex from the outside.  But more importantly, there were moans coming somewhat loudly from inside the showers.<br />
<br />
Matthew laughed.  &quot;Are they seriously—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!&quot; Ahmed called as he took off running towards the showers.  Matthew smiled, curious as to what transformations were taking place, and followed after the other boy.  Ahmed, to his credit, was very concerned, going so far as to sprint all the way through the changing area and end up at the showers.  &quot;Guys!&quot; he yelled at the three of them.<br />
<br />
Matthew came to a stop in the archway, then took a few more steps onto the wet tile floor, his shoes slipping a little as he did.  There was a communal showering area off to one side, but it looked like Lukas, Francis, and Eric each were on the opposite side where there were personal showers.  Cleary, they had tried to take Coach Bank&#39;s advise even without hearing it as there were dividers splitting them up.<br />
<br />
Stone patterning made up the upper third of he wall with blue and silver tiles for the remaining space.  The partial walls pushed out to make eight alcoves in total.  They couldn&#39;t tell who was in each, but there was someone in the far left, then three slots over in the center-left, then the one more in the far right.<br />
<br />
Matthew looked at how the dim illumination of the room seemed to light each occupant from the front, giving them each a telling silhouette.  In the farthest left was a figure with wide, child-baring hips and what was perhaps antenna, tall ears, or horns.  The center was built like Lukas, but a little more curved, as if looking at the back of an amazon.  And the final figure, on the far right, was slender, plump, and gave the slightest outline of breasts as they turned sideways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys?&quot;  Matthew asked softly, <i>really</i> curious what he was about see.  In truth, the three figures each seemed to stop or slow their movements.  Ahmed just watched in shock for a moment as Matthew approached the figure on the right.  &quot;We gotta see,&quot; Matt said as he stepped forward and pulled aside the curtain.<br />
<br />
In the shower was... well, it was Eric.  His tail long, leopard tail twitching at the very tip as he turned to see Matthew.  This showed off his boner in a way that the other man cared not to see and averted his eyes up to Eric&#39;s blossoming chest of barely lumped up breasts.  His muscles hadn&#39;t left him, but his shoulders had narrowed a bit, and his butt had plumped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I wasn&#39;t d-doing anything,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
Ahmed had had enough.  &quot;Alright.  Out!&quot; he said as he approached the central alcove.  When no one came out, he pulled aside the curtain to find Lukas finishing his task... which is to say, he opened the view of his teammate and his teammate ejaculated all over his chest.  Ahmed reflexively reached up to his chest, dealing with the feeling of being shot by the force and quantity.<br />
<br />
Ahmed stumbled backwards, slipped on the wet tile, and fell onto his ass.  This left him looking up at Lukas who could now be described as &#39;amazonian&#39;.  The man was thicker of muscle by more than a little, though like Eric he&#39;d smoothed out a little bit in the legs and face.  And, just above his penis, was some pinkest flesh with two little nubs which took Ahmed&#39;s brain a moment to register as the beginning of an udder.<br />
<br />
Lukas opened his mouth, but all he managed to say, after removing his hand from his dick, was: &quot;This isn&#39;t what it looks like!&quot;<br />
<br />
From the far left stall, Francis peaked out.  Rabbit ears were shrinking back into human ears as his eyes alternated between Lukas and Ahmed.  &quot;It totally <i>is</i> what it looks like,&quot; he said, his voice feminine, but returning its male tone.  &quot;Glad you guys showed up,&quot; Francis said, taking the soap and shampoo as he moved across the space and to the non-walled showers.  &quot;I just started cleaning, so watch me finish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch you?&quot; Lukas and Ahmed both asked at the same time before looking at each other, then back at Francis.<br />
<br />
Francis took in and let out a singular long breath.  &quot;I think because the closed shower was too much like home, my brain had logged it as &#39;jerk-off time&#39; he said as his ears were basically all human even if his rear hadn&#39;t shrunk back down yet.  In truth, Francis only logged mentally that he was changing, not how, so there was a tiny bit of daze going on.  &quot;It... it wasn&#39;t a &#39;wave&#39; like earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahmed frowned.  His cloths were somewhat soaked already and he began to disrobe.  It was only then that he could hear grunting and thrusting from Eric and Matthew&#39;s direction.<br />
<br />
<em>Like, two minutes ago, tops... ———————————————</em><br />
<br />
Eric stuttered: &quot;I... I wasn&#39;t d-doing anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you weren&#39;t,&quot; Matthew said softly as Ahem rushed towards the central stall.  Taking one step forward, Matt legitimately slipped and fell into Eric before each of them caught the other.  Matthew&#39;s hand moved over the top of Eric&#39;s softening breasts as he pushed himself off of him, but as he doing so brought a light gasp from Eric.  With it... the lump of tissue halted it&#39;s shrinking, paused, then expanded very slowly as Matthew carefully rubbed the nipple on purpose.<br />
<br />
Eric let out a slight moan, and Matthew grew a little hard.  <i>Breasts?</i> his mind questioned at the speed of light.  <i>Only women have breasts,</i> he was certain.  While Eric&#39;s dick was a big turn-off, Matt couldn&#39;t see it from this angle.  &quot;Fuck, girl, you&#39;re so sexy,&quot; he whispered over his teammate&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a—&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew shushed &#39;her&#39;, one hand fondling Eric&#39;s left breast, while the other reached up under his tail.  &quot;I think you want to be,&quot; said the man with the fluffy, spotted deer tail.  &quot;I think this pussy wish she had a pussy,&quot; he grinned, squeezing up under Eric&#39;s ass with his right hand.  Eric&#39;s breasts were notably actual cup-sizes now under one hand, but under the other... Matthew felt something move.<br />
<br />
Matthew&#39;s pants were tight as he had to have imagined the ripple of skin, the feeling of a body moving beneath his fingers, but if what he felt was true... he didn&#39;t know what he would do.  &quot;What was—&quot; he began, until one finger reached the very edge of a not yet open cleft between Eric&#39;s legs. &quot;—that,&quot; he finished the thought.  &quot;Oh, yes... you really do want this... go ahead,&quot; he rubbed Eric&#39;s lower lips.  &quot;Imagine how good it would feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt those fingers upon his neo-vagina and shuttered.  Together, he and Matthew worked out the details, you might say.  Eric would push back towards Matthew and, in Eric&#39;s mind, Matthew was the one in control of this... carving out a channel to fit his manhood while Eric was at his mercy.  It was situation of submissive aligning with humiliation and soon enough, Eric had a human pussy of his own.  He moaned and thrust back against the larger man.<br />
<br />
All the while, Matthew had removed one hand from Eric&#39;s slightly less than average breasts and unzipped his pants.  His new, pinker shaft wasn&#39;t as human as Matthew remembered.  But it was still a penis, and it would certainly do just as well for Eric as it would for his girlfriend Jessica... or her sister Rebecca... or all the other girls he&#39;d cheated on her with.<br />
<br />
Ahmed, currently the only one not in or recovering from lust, called towards the curtain that the two men were inside of: &quot;The fuck are you two doing!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The <i>fuck</i> we <i>are,&quot;</i> Matthew called back.  Then he leaned in towards Eric from behind and whispered in his ear again.  &quot;If you don&#39;t tell them you want this, Eric... they&#39;re going to make me stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Stop?</i> Eric tried to ponder, a portion of his rational mind waking up and looking around as if from a haze.  But like a person drowning in a swimming pool—and, admittedly, under a curse—Eric found he was unable to agree with that notion as soon as Matthew teased his bulbous head along Eric&#39;s new pussy lips.  <i>This might be my only chance...</i> the virgin—if you want to use that term—convinced himself.<br />
<br />
Matthew was a trusted teammate, Eric instantly convinced himself.  And, from Matt&#39;s last words was, in truth, an instant.  &quot;Just let me have this!&quot; Eric pleaded loudly to the guys on the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m out,&quot; Francis said, eyes wide as he found his hand on his dick before pulling it away and slapping his own face.  &quot;I mean it,&quot; he said, exerting willpower to hurry out of the shower area.  &quot;Resisting is <i>so</i> much harder, even without a &#39;wave&#39;.&quot; And with that, the young man with the puffy rabbit tail was out of the room without any new changes.<br />
<br />
The same could not be said for Lukas who was entranced with what he saw, but Ahmed saw him stroking his dick again and grabbed that arm, specifically.  &quot;I can&#39;t stop all tree of you, but I can save one,&quot; he declared, meeting Lukas eyes.  Lukas, for his part, misread the closeness in his clouded mind and tried to lean forward and give Ahem a kiss.  But at that point, the other man slapped him across the face with opposite hand, full-fore.  Then, Ahmed yanked on the bigger man&#39;s arm to pull him to his feet.  &quot;You&#39;ll thank me later,&quot; he said, and meant it, dragging the bigger man out of the showers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Matthew was loving his new toy.  He&#39;d been speaking into Eric&#39;s ears the whole time he casually thrust, letting that new tunnel get experience.  Matt&#39;s penis continued to growl larger, and he ended up hitting Eric&#39;s cervix rather quickly.  When that happened, he encouraged the other man to envision his passage widening, deepening... to have a plumper bottom, and plumper lips to cushion the impact.<br />
<br />
All the while, Matthew&#39;s balls fell large and heavy in a furred sack.  Tiny numbs began to grow out of his skull, and his own body shifted shape slightly.  Indeed, as Eric&#39;s limited—but, to Matthew, <i>important</i>—changes happened, Matthew&#39;s body was shifting more as he teased and teased and denied climax to them both.<br />
<br />
Matthew leaned in, breathlessly, and persisted: &quot;Just think of it,&quot; he implored.  &quot;Sex as a woman.  Periods like a women.  Babies like a women,&quot; he sneered, but Eric couldn&#39;t see it, his hands up on the wall under the shower now.  His voice faked a genuine care that he&#39;d long practiced: &quot;This can be you with this &#39;gift&#39;, <i>forever.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Resting outside of Eric for a moment, Matthew&#39;s body had not yet passed his brain the memo that he softened his shape while remaining the same size.  His face, his shoulders, and most of all his hips had all shifted feminine... because as he encouraged Eric to focus on his changes, he too had focused on them.  Just as their respective transformations began to recede, Matthew began thrusting again.<br />
<br />
As Matthew picked up speed, he held onto Eric&#39;s stomach, leaning back with his eyes closed.  Eric&#39;s tail up and off to one side, Matthew only had a moment to realize that his chest had ballooned up into a different kind of deer rack.  The only part of his body besides his balls wrapped in fur, the feeling brought him into the moment.  But in the time it took him to realize his situation and tell his body to stop fucking Eric with purpose, Eric came and came hard.<br />
<br />
Eric was now what he was, locked by the curse in his shudders back against his teammate.  But Matthew... Matthew had a moment... a tension.  <i>Hold it!</i> he yelled at himself in his own head.  And for an instant, he was convinced he could do it... pull out and step back and calm himself down.  But it was not to be, and, in truth, it was all his fault.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breed me, you fuck!&quot; demanded Eric as he shoved his round ass back against Matthew, that quivering, rock-hard shaft up inside of him.  Matthew had created a monster... a monster that only just heard himself speak for the first time.  It was still his own voice, but the words.  <i>What the fuck am I saying!?</i> Eric asked, coming to his senses too late.<br />
<br />
That last thrust was the end of Matthew&#39;s masculinity.<br />
<br />
His body shaking, he made a shrill-like yell, a deer&#39;s noise, as his mind wanted to push away... but his body was like &#39;fuck you, we&#39;re literally <i>doing</i> this&#39;.  His arms pulled against Eric&#39;s form, hands gripping his breasts, as Matthew came and came... The spurts didn&#39;t even start until after Eric and he could both feel Eric&#39;s belly protruding outwards with how much he was being filled.<br />
<br />
The two thrust back and forth against each other lightly for a moment before they both came down and Matthew too realized what he&#39;d done.  Not all of what he&#39;d done, mind you, as it would be a moment before some of the cum would come leaking out of Eric&#39;s no longer virgin cunt.  There was just a the tiniest hint of blood there...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, holy shit,&quot; was Mathew&#39;s new female voice, though honestly either of them could have said those same words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re good,&quot; Eric said, turning around to face Matthew.  His breasts were on full display there, with wide areolae and plump nipples.  &quot;Looks at me,&quot; he said, running his hands over his belly.  &quot;This... this is crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
But when Matthew looked down at the curve of Eric&#39;s body, he couldn&#39;t help but see white dripping from Eric&#39;s still hard, human cock.  And with that, Matthew&#39;s uncomfortable straightness reasserted itself.  Covering his mouth as if he might vomit, he scrambled out of the showers and away from his dirty deed.<br />
<br />
His dirty deed, Eric, cried out for him in anger and tears, but Matthew blocked it out.  What he couldn&#39;t block out, though, was the sensation that his shirt had ripped at its sides for his new, weighty breasts.  His pants had been pulled into striped rips where his thighs and ass had expanded.  His hair was longer, and his legs shapelier.<br />
<br />
Focusing on himself, and no one else, Matthew looked up and down the full-sized mirror on the wall of the locker room.  He met his own eyes, and looked down at his own cock and balls... but oh so much else, in his cismale mind screamed at the loudest possible volume that all this was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a dick-girl...&quot;</p>
