<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My name is Mark, and I am responsible for everything you have been reading about these past few days.  I don’t <br />
want forgiveness, I just want to use what little time I have left to get the true story out there.  Maybe <br />
somebody else can fix this, I tried to, but I failed.  You probably don’t trust me, you probably want to know <br />
where Tom is.  I’ll try to tell you as much as I can and hopefully I answer all your questions and win your <br />
trust.  The changes are all true, they’ve been happening.  The bros have been taking over our school.  But the <br />
man you thought was trying to warn and help you is a mad man.  I would know, I used to be one of his best <br />
friends.  Tom is not who you think he is, and the story isn’t quite as he told you it was.  <br />
<br />
I’ll try to start from the beginning.  Before I even came into the picture Tom had a friend named David.  They <br />
grew up together, sand box buddies or whatever sentimental tag you wanna give it.  The real cutesy life long <br />
friendship sort of thing, or not.  Tom came here to this boring hole in the earth for college and David went <br />
elsewhere.  The first time apart can be hard on any couple.  I joke about it, like I did back then when he <br />
first told me but now its to loosen my own nerves.  A year goes by, too much work and school to keep up but <br />
summer comes like dawn and Tom’s glowing in the morning light.  They were going to meet up, I was asked to go, <br />
not much for borderline homos though so I didn’t.  That was probably my first mistake.  Tom goes, day goes by <br />
like usual, Tom comes back.  I expected to get my ear talked off about their little date, instead I saw a man <br />
who looked like he just crawled back from Hell.  I wish I had listened, tried to pay attention, helped in some <br />
way.  He was going on about how David had changed into a total ‘bro’.  I just blew it off and told him that’s <br />
what happens in college, it’s the way of the world.  You get here and you leave your intelligence, childhood <br />
dreams and other shit at the door and grab a beer.  All he did was whine and go on about how this was <br />
different, how David was different, he was such a great person etc etc and now he wasn’t.  Honestly at the <br />
time I wanted to stab myself in the ears I had no idea how much pain was festering in that fragile mind of <br />
his.  <br />
<br />
Months went by and Tom seemed better but he was secretive, reclusive, strange even, more so then usual.  I <br />
started going through his history.  This site and several others showed up.  At first it was mostly CYOC and <br />
other tf fantasy websites, then he got darker.  It was hypnosis sites, magic sites, anything that promised <br />
real tfing.  Another mistake, I should’ve jumped in there, maybe it would’ve changed things.  But kept going, <br />
he got more shut in until he spent virtually every moment on his computer focused on tfs and tfing.  One day I <br />
went to his room to check on him and found him in front of the mirror dressed up.  He was wearing clothes that <br />
can only be defined as ‘broish’: a snapback, a chain, tight polo, shorts and those ugly boat shoes people wear <br />
for some reason.  This alone was pretty ridiculous but they weren’t even his size, it was like he was wearing <br />
someone else’s clothes.  He was posing, flexing and talking to himself in bro slang.  I thought it was kind of <br />
funny him acting like a total wannabe so I got out my phone and started a capture to send to some friends for <br />
a laugh later.  That was when things got really weird, Tom wasn’t just talking to himself, he was arguing.  It <br />
went something like this.<br />
<br />
“Bro, just let me out… cmon you want it, being sexy, being loved…”<br />
“No, no David I won’t stop doing this!”<br />
“Too late to turn back Tommy, you’re already a bro, just look at you in my swag, like it was meant to be.”<br />
“God what have I done?  Please, please don’t do this.”<br />
“You want this, you put it on, you figured out how to do this… you, you, you, now me.”<br />
“This isn’t what you want.”<br />
“Too fucking bad bro, its just what you got…”<br />
<br />
They went on for awhile, his voice actually changing throughout the conversation.  It was freaking me out as <br />
he switched between his fake bro voice and a true deep one.  Then he just went limp, his arms fell down <br />
perfectly relaxed and his eyes glazed over.  Everything slackened and it looked like he was being held up by <br />
invisible strings as his head jerked up.  I watched as he started to struggle in front of the mirror, his <br />
veins swelled to hideous proportions and I could actually see them… pumping something through him.  His arms <br />
twisted in grotesque and impossible ways, bending and breaking as they grew longer and leaner.  The muscles <br />
squirmed as if made of liquid and built up into impressive masses along his arms, especially his biceps which <br />
swelled to almost jockish size.  His hands flopped about as if he had no bones before quickly and painfully <br />
straightening and then beginning to extend.  His fingers were almost pulled out as some invisible force <br />
stretched them out making his hands grow.  They curled into fists and relaxed, longer still as a tan spread <br />
out from the tips of his fingers, surging inward.  His hands became enveloped in sun kissed, foreign skin <br />
which spread across his arms lightening and thickening the fuzz on them as the muscles kept growing and <br />
molding.  He let out a long gasp as his lungs drew in more air than he could hold, his chest kept rising and <br />
pushing out and his lungs kept expanding until he perfectly fitted the polo.  His pecs now a perfect shelf of <br />
hard meaty muscle.  He bent backwards in a way that made me wince, the cracking sound was so loud, so <br />
horrible.  His spine broke and lengthened, the pain had to be unimaginable.  He straightened out and shrugged <br />
as his shoulders inched out and his arms filled the sleeves to the brim.  I could see the shorts filling out <br />
to, knowing everything was happening… there, his legs becoming like his arms and his shoes bulging out a bit <br />
as his feet shifted to fit them.  His face was twisted beyond recognition, tan, masculine, the features of a <br />
different person entirely.  His eyes glowing, his hair shortening and thickening into blond curls.  His chin <br />
dropped a bit further, sharpening, his cheek bones rose up.  Stubble began appearing in small patches before <br />
becoming more uniform, overtaking his chin.  It was like watching a pro photoshop on fast forward.  He gave <br />
one last look of true terror at the mirror before a big, forced looking smile appeared and he just started <br />
laughing and laughing in a different voice.  I stumbled out, accidentally sending the video.  <br />
<br />
I didn’t hear from my friends the rest of the day, they didn’t return my calls.  When I next saw them, they <br />
were bros.  They sent the video to more people.  The weak minded usually, nerds, geeks, the desperate to fit <br />
in.  They were easily dominated.  But that wasn’t enough for the new ‘Tom.’  He started planning a big party <br />
to change the rest of the school, he was obsessed with making everyone a bro.  After seeing what just the <br />
video could do he figured out a way to change people into bros himself.  I followed him around and pieced <br />
together his plan, watching him recruit key allies and eliminate enemies.  First was his own cousin, Evan, <br />
easily influenced and Evan had access to plenty of alcohol to supply to the party since his mom owned a store.  <br />
Then he changed his Josh, one of the school’s best DJ’s to supply music followed by one of the schools most <br />
well connected flamers to extend his reach and get a good supply of girls to attract guys.  Finally, he went <br />
after the only thing in his way.  The jocks.  He crashed their party and changed all of them right in front of <br />
me, as if daring me to try to stop him.  I found this site yesterday in his history and I’ve read his posts.  <br />
I don’t think it was made up, the horror he described as he watched each change was probably real.  Even <br />
though he caused it and wanted it I think watching them made him relive his own friends change and his own <br />
transformation.  I know once I make this post he’ll know I know too much and make sure I can’t do anything <br />
more but that’ll happen sooner or later anyway and I want the truth to get out.  I need the truth to get out <br />
so I haven’t sacrificed myself for nothing.  <br />
<br />
I hear Tom outside.  He’s pounding on the door.  There are others out there too, I can’t count how many.  This <br />
is it.  For what its worth I’m sorry, to all of you and to Tom especially if he ever reads this and can still <br />
even understand it.  <br />
<br />
- End.</p>
