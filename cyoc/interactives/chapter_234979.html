<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I know I can use the necklace&#39;s magic to change myself, but... Will it work on something else?&quot; Terra wondered while she stared at the crimson disks around her neck. &quot;Or someone else...&quot; She smiled and sneaked out of her room. It was very late and her parents were already at their room.<br />
<br />
The house was very quiet and she wondered if her little brother, Matt, was already sleeping. She planned to use him as her test subject but she didn&#39;t want to waste a disks to make him cooperate with her. After a few minutes waiting, she finally decided to go in Matt&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
She softly knocked the door in case he wasn&#39;t sleeping yet. Because she got no answer, she felt confident enough to came inside. In there, Matt was sleeping covered with a thin blanket. It was summer, but that made him feel safe. Terra stared at him for a while before doing anything.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t very tall, being 10 years old and far from puberty made it totally normal. However, Terra always liked it that way, his little brother was very cute to her eyes and she can&#39;t even imagine how he would look when he gets older. She knew teenage boys aren&#39;t cute at all, they&#39;re greasy, sweaty and awkward. She wondered if Matt&#39;s going to become like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s only one way to know it.&quot; She whispered while she rubbed Matt&#39;s blonde messy hair for an instant. &quot;I wish that Matt will turn into a grown man while he&#39;s sleeping...&quot; She was mid sentence when she realized he will outgrown his clothes. &quot;And his clothes are going to fit him no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waited for a few minutes, she already knew the magic didn&#39;t work immediately and she took the opportunity to take the blanket off him. She was a little bit surprised to realize that Matt was wearing just a pair of briefs instead of his usual pajamas. &quot;It&#39;s a hot summer night after all.&quot; She thought.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately after she exposed her brother&#39;s barely dressed body, he started to change. At first, his arms and legs were just lengthening, followed by his hand and feet. He was taller but nothing impressive. Then he groaned a little and he suddenly went through a drastic change.<br />
<br />
He now looked like a preteen boy, ready to start puberty. And puberty kicked him very hard. He grew almost a foot taller, his torso lengthened and his body lost all of his remaining baby fat, now he looked lanky and skinny. But didn&#39;t last too long. Muscles started to bulk and his face got a more mature look, starting to show what he would look in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;He look like the boys at my class.&quot; Terra said while she watched that something was happening in Matt&#39;s briefs. The almost flat surface was growing a little bulge. Nothing too impressive but very notorious when there was nothing there a minute ago. It swelled a little and stayed like that for a few second before it started to make a tent. It was Matt&#39;s first erection!<br />
<br />
Terra blushed but she can&#39;t take her eyes off it. That cause she didn&#39;t notice that Matt was already surpassing her in age and through puberty. His former hairless armpits were now exposing fuzzy bushes, a thin layer of hair had grown on Matt&#39;s arms and a thicker one had developed on his legs. &quot;He&#39;s not my cute little brother anymore.&quot; Terra thought while she watched Matt&#39;s treasure trail sprouting on his flat belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He now looks like a high school student.&quot; Terra thought while she watched at the young man that had replaced her 10 years old brother. But Terra didn&#39;t specified an age, and it seems that Matt was still changing. Now that puberty was almost done on him, he started to grow from a teenager to fully developed man.<br />
<br />
His arms suddenly bulked out with big muscles, followed closely by his chest where two slabs of pecs had pushed out. Matt nipples looked tiny in comparison and they&#39;re pointing downward now. &quot;Oh wow, Matt is getting so big.&quot; Terra thought while she watched Matt&#39;s abs pushing out and getting defined despite of the hair around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my!!&quot; Terra blushed deeply red when she noticed that Matt&#39;s tent on his brief had grown up a lot since the last time she saw it. Now, Matt&#39;s balls silhouette can be seen through the fabric. Even his mushroom shaped glans was visible which was leaking clear precum to make it way more notorious.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a sasquatch.&quot; She thought despite Matt wasn&#39;t that hairy. She noticed that pubes where protruding from above the briefs and even some were going down to connect with his leg hair. Finally those legs grew muscles as well and his feet elongated a few sizes to match. Terra was glad the bed was big enough to bear that big guy.<br />
<br />
And it was done. The former 10 years old cute button boy was now a handsome man on his twenties. He looked like a junior bodybuilder at Terra&#39;s eyes, but she didn&#39;t meet to many grown men, so it wasn&#39;t a very objective opinion... Like petting a dog, she wanted to touch what was in front of her and she started to rub Matt&#39;s leg. Those fuzzy hairs felt funny between her fingers.<br />
<br />
She was moving her hand up through his legs, but before she touched his privates, she stopped. She stayed there a few more minutes watching how handsome and manly Matt looks. She even considered made herself older and a boy to fraternize with him, but she remembered she didn&#39;t made any mental change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt&#39;s going to freak out if he watches himself like that.&quot; She said and she didn&#39;t notice she spoke so loud this time that Matt woke up for a brief moment. The young man exposed his clear blue eyes for a few seconds without realizing what was going on. However, it was enough for Terra&#39;s wish undid almost instantly and he turned into the little boy he is.<br />
<br />
He fell asleep again and he suddenly turned into a grown man again. Terra can&#39;t believe what had just happened. It&#39;s like he was only able to stay as a man when he&#39;s sleeping. She tried to remind her exact words and then she realized it. She had wished that Matt turned into a grown man while he&#39;s sleeping. So that&#39;s going to happen, not just this moment or this night, but all the time he falls asleep.<br />
<br />
Terra had accidentally cursed her brother with that transformation and she wondered if she should undo that wish or wait and see what it&#39;s going to happen on the next days. One thing was sure, she wasn&#39;t worried anymore of waking Matt up, so she started to rub him on more places than just his legs.</p>
