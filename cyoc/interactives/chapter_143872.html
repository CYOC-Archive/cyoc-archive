<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Thank you for coming with me,&quot; a young woman commented a small group of people sat in one of the waiting rooms at Horizon, &quot;it helps me feel comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that the young woman was uncomfortable, but after a long trip getting to use a spare room  the apartment that one of her present hosts, Anne Cumbertin, shared with her bond-mate, Oscar, having Anne and Janice there was helpful. Particularly as she&#39;d found a lot of things moving rather hectically in Lyre and Animalia, particularly as they celebrated the Lunar New Year. She supposed it related to the fact that in the Chinese Zodiac there were various animals to represent specific years in a rotation, and for a community of uplifted animals or converted humans that was Animalia, some of that connection was taken with excitement even if the people weren&#39;t of Asian ancestry or follow the Chinese Zodiac. In fact she actually enjoyed some of the proposed festivities that went along with it, but for the moment while she was still Human and Anne and Janice were both Striped Skunk Animalians, young Fleur felt a bit &quot;left out&quot; as it were.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are always there for you dear,&quot; Anne said softly as she sat in the chair across from Fleur, who was seated next to Janice, &quot;We are family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I decide not to be a skunk?&quot; Fleur asked as she ran her fingers through Janice&#39;s tail. <br />
<br />
The fur was long and silky smooth to Fleur&#39;s fingers. It really felt nice, and Fleur felt she could spend hours just stroking the appendage, though Janice seemed protective of it and would have personally preferred to be with her own bond-mate, Walter. It was enough to recognize that there was only so much that Fleur could get away with when it came to showing her happy enthusiasm at being reunited with family. Though, while Fleur enjoyed messing Janice to a degree, her personal choice leaned more toward foxes. Their fur was soft too and they were also quite sleek and agile, without the &quot;odor&quot; issue with skunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you don&#39;t want to be a skunk,&quot; Janice assured her, &quot;now please... stop petting my tail. I&#39;m not a pet and we&#39;re not lovers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we are family,&quot; Fleur teased, which made Janice give a frustrated sigh to Anne. <br />
<br />
Anne only replied with a knowing look, which left Janice feeling a bit frustrated in the fact that Fleur had seemed more interested in her tail than anything else. Fleur wasn&#39;t aggressive or mean, by any means, but Janice was clearly opposed to being petted like a pet. In this, Janice accepted Fleur&#39;s willingness to convert as a means to end that sort of thing. For as an Animalian, Fleur would either recognize that having a big furry tail didn&#39;t mean one wanted to be petted, or would at least have her own tail. It was then that Judy came in and looked to Fleur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ready?&quot; Fleur asked standing up and eyeing the generous swell of Judy&#39;s bosom under the sea green button down shirt that she was presently wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Judy nodded with a nervous glance to both Anne and Janice as she noticed the almost hungry look in Fleur&#39;s eyes. This in turn made the uplifted Rabbit Animalian a bit nervous, but she continued on as Fleur stood up and began to follow Judy out from the waiting room and toward one of the transformation rooms.<br />
<br />
&quot;The wait was a bit longer than I expected...&quot; Fleur commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... while the Red Fox is the most common fox species,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;but you requested the Platinum color scheme... something I&#39;ve only seen with domestic foxes... and even then, only on television.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But aren&#39;t there already a bunch of Fox Animalians in Animalia?&quot; Fleur asked curiously, &quot;Your deputy mayor is a Red Fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded, &quot;Yes, but nearly all of them are the standard Red Fox coloration. Those that aren&#39;t of the &quot;cross phase.&quot; They don&#39;t have the genes that have resulted in the Platinum phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Fleur managed as they made their way to the door that lead into the transformation room, where one of the Horizon staff members was there with a small plastic box in his hands that held the needles that carried the specific formula that would be needed for Fleur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go on in,&quot; Judy instructed to Fleur, &quot;the door isn&#39;t locked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t that let you come in and ravage me?&quot; Fleur asked playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could...&quot; Judy sighed, &quot;but with our Edicts, your privacy will be respected if you so desire it, and as an uplifted rabbit, I am not interested in those of my gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Fleur said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family can help you with contacts that will be of help to you,&quot; Judy assured her, &quot;and you may find someone among those Humans that have become Animalians that are interested...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fleur slowly nodded and reached out for the door and opened it. It swung inward and allowed her in. The room was more sterile than the room at Anne and Oscar&#39;s apartment that she&#39;d been given, but from what she&#39;d seen reported on Animalia and Horizon, she figured it made sense. She settled in and sat down on the bed provided and then waited for Judy to came in. It wasn&#39;t long before she did come in with the Horizon attendant in the doorway and standing with the box. This gave Judy the time to keep herself focused and ready, just in case Fleur got to excitable. However, Fleur remained still and let Judy apply the shots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; Judy offered to Fleur as she finished with the second shot and then left the room with the attendant shutting the door behind them.<br />
<br />
The room was already feeling warmer as they left, and Fleur though she could hear the door click shut as the latch clicked. True, a shutting door wouldn&#39;t necessarily be silent, but as the other two left the shutting of the door sounded far louder than she would have anticipated. At the same time she felt a bit of slight discomfort, particularly in her hands hand feet, which was something she remembered from talks with Anne and Janice. The transformation wasn&#39;t necessarily painful, but certain parts of it could be uncomfortable, particularly in cases where the changing body grew past the size their clothes could contain  or when there were massive alterations to the skull and feet where the movement of bones wasn&#39;t always pleasurable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I am on my way,&quot; Fleur mused to her self and lifted one foot up and reached down so as to undo the laces.<br />
<br />
As she did so, she could see white fur beginning to grow out around her hands and forearms. At the same time small nubs were growing out of her fingertips, becoming the short stubby claws that Red Foxes had. But the noticeable difference was in the fur color. The standard Red Fox that most knew, like Robbie, had a largely red orange body with dark brown or black gloves/socks on the paws with a white tail tip and a white underbelly. However, the Red Fox was also known for various color phases that went beyond the norm, and Fleur had picked one of those color phases, the platinum phase. In this phase the gloves/socks and tail tip were white. The tail, upper legs, shoulders, and ears were a blackish-blue, while the head and body were more of a silver-blue. And as Fleur unlaced her shoes and then pulled down her socks she could see that coloration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becoming beautiful,&quot; Fleur said happily as stood up and twirled on her lengthening feet and managing to just keep her balance as she settled onto her feet as they grew longer and pushed her into a more digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
As she got used to her new feet, she made her way across the room, feeling a bit constrained by her clothes at the moment. Her pants and underwear seemed to fit rather tightly around her hips and rear. Not to the point of breaking, but they were a bit tighter than before as she could feel her hips flare out wider, taking the same sort of stance that all Animalians were known for. Fleur got the same sensation with regard to her chest, as she could feel her breasts swelling within the fabric prison that was her bra. Some things pinched a bit as her bosom swelled to the generous size that a double dosed Animalian would have. Fleur noted this and loved it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about bra busters,&quot; Fleur happily mused to herself, either not knowing that Animalia&#39;s Cow Animalians were larger in terms of their chest sizes and Jen and Marjorie dwarfed all of them. <br />
<br />
Fleur was really only comparable to most other Fox Animalians, like Robbie&#39;s wife, Martha, but if Fleur fully knew that, she didn&#39;t care... For she felt happy to join Animalia and in a way be like her cousin and aunt. And since Animalia made them the beautiful Skunk women they were, Fleur was happy to be a beautiful Fox woman with them. And as she looked in the mirror, she could also see that her ears had already moved up to the top of her head. She kept them perked and gave a very happy smile, revealing more pointed teeth as her face began to push out into a narrow and pointed vulpine muzzle. It looked more painful than it actually felt, and Fleur found herself happily barking as her body continued to change.<br />
<br />
The final part of her change came from behind her. It started as a small nub, but it slowly began to grow out longer with long soft and silky fur covering it. At first it wasn&#39;t too bad, but as her tail began to grow longer and larger it began to compete with her swelling hips and rear for space in her pants, and space that her clothing couldn&#39;t easily give. Animalians had to have an assortment of flaps and folds in their clothing to accommodate tails as they went about their daily lives. For some that had very thick tails like the Crocodilian Animalians and Dinotopians probably had to have even greater modifications to accommodate their tails. Fleur, however, had come as a Human and thus for the moment wasn&#39;t wearing anything that would easily accommodate a tail. Thus, Fleur did the only thing she could do. She pulled the back of her pants and underwear down a little so that her tail could freely grow out behind her, and as it did she loved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;J&#39;adore,&quot; Fleur thought to herself as she curled her tail around and caught in her paws. It felt softer than Janice&#39;s and it was flexible too. She happily nuzzled her tail for a moment and then marveled at the fox woman in the mirror. Her clothing wasn&#39;t the most fancy, but she was very well built with a sort of sensual beauty that Fleur had dreamed of having and at times had desired enjoying as well. That made her feel even better, as she got the sense that now she would have some new games to play with Janice and even mused that when she found a good girlfriend, Janice and Walter would go for a double date... or maybe bring Anne and Oscar too, and all of them could talk and enjoy how marvelously wonderful they&#39;d all become.</p>
