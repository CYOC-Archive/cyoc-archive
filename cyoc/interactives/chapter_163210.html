<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jory woke slowly, that wine he&#39;d been drinking may not be getting him drunk but he certainly felt like he had a hangover. His head was splitting. His legs were sore and strangely, his feet felt stiff. He tried to pull the sheet off of him but it stuck in places where his cum from his dreams had soaked through the sheet. It was not pleasant, and he winced at it tugged at some of his body hair.<br />
<br />
It took him a moment to notice he wasn&#39;t alone in the room. Theo was at the table, having set down a tray with a meal and a chilled pitched of that damned wine on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breakfast in bed?&quot; Jory asked trying to be funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch. Basil thought you deserved to sleep in just today. Though that means Bruto is chomping at the bit to have you all afternoon.&quot; Theo made no comment as to Jory&#39;s state as he struggled to get out of bed.<br />
<br />
When his feet hit the ground he stared at them, four toes, and the nails were black. He flexed them and they were stiff, like the joints weren&#39;t working quite right. He reached for his forehead and found the source of his headache, two nubs were growing from his skull, though they felt to be no more than an inch long at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, every day is going to be one shock after another for a bit.&quot; Theo said. &quot;C&#39;mon, eat up and then I&#39;ll show you to the baths, then I&#39;ll turn you over to Bruto.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jory looked about for something to cover himself with. &quot;My um..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen a naked dude before, we mostly wear those for a little modesty. Most satyrs would wander around naked if we wouldn&#39;t shock half the realms doing so. I think everyone was dressed yesterday more for your benefit, someone&#39;s usually naked.&quot; Theo laughed. &quot;If it makes you feel better.&quot; Theo undid the wrap at his waist and tossed it aside. Jory didn&#39;t know what he was expecting, but between the two furry goat legs was a very normal human looking cock. Well, normal in all things but size. It was soft, but it must have been eight inches. As big as Jory was hard, and a pair of heavy egg-sized, goat-furred balls hanging behind it.<br />
<br />
Jory sighed and got up, his morning wood was particularly.. hard. His dick felt swollen to the point it should hurt, but it just felt.. horny. Theo whistled. &quot;Hmm... if you&#39;re that big now, once the change hits your cock you&#39;re going to be truly impressive, no wonder Basil wanted you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jory looked down at his rigid cock then back to Theo, confusion obvious on his face. He sat down and poured himself some of the wine, downing that before he began eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Around the magic realms &#39;hung like a satyr&#39; is kind of like &#39;hung like a horse&#39; back home. We&#39;re pretty well-endowed as a species. I&#39;m only kind of average.&quot; Jory must have looked skeptical. &quot;Really, I was average as a human so I&#39;m average as a satyr.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me escape.&quot; Jory said after a moment.<br />
<br />
Theo sighed and shook his head. &quot;There&#39;s no going back, none for you and none for me. I suggest you forget your old life and move on. Your old friends, family.. all of that.. just.. just let it go. It&#39;s cruel to say but it&#39;s easier in the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jory shoved some sort of bread slathered with butter into his mouth. He had never been so hungry. &quot;Why buy anyone at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Theo shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s the way of things here. A lot of these beings hold grudges against humans for chasing them from ancestral homes, others its a matter of survival, some.. I couldn&#39;t tell you. Basil.. You&#39;d have to ask him why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, Jory had eaten all the food and drunk the wine, but he hardly felt full. Theo got to his feet and motioned for Jory to follow. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I.. get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Theo shook his head. &quot;New rule. No clothes for you until your change is done. Gotta break you of those human habits, get you comfortable in your own skin.&quot; Theo just kept walking.<br />
<br />
Jory opened his mouth to argue but ended up just following after. It wasn&#39;t a long walk, just to another room in the manor, and they didn&#39;t even come across anyone. But this room was warm, and a large basin in the middle was filled with water. &quot;Welcome to the baths.&quot; Theo stepped right into the waters, motioning for Jory to join him.<br />
<br />
It did look inviting, and soon Jory found himself sinking into the warm waters. He found some soap and something scrubber like on a tray on the side of the bath and began to work at cleaning up last night&#39;s mess. Theo seemed content to just lounge. Though when Jory got to his own cock, it was still rigid, having not gone down one bit since he woke, and trying to clean himself was simply sending waves of pleasure through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to help you with that?&quot; Theo asked, one eye open and focused on Jory.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can clean myself..&quot; He said back with a bit of a snap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that..&quot; Theo moved across the bath so he was next to Jory and took the rigid cock in his hand. &quot;This.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. I don&#39;t think..&quot; Jory started but Theo cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I was a macho guy when I first got here. Thought two men having pleasuring each other was.. wrong. I was wrong. And my first few weeks here would have been much easier if I had let Bruto take some of my pent up frustrations from me. When I finally let go, it was so much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jory bit his lip, but nodded. He expected Theo to start jerking him off, but instead the blond-haired satyr was suddenly straddling his lap, guiding his cock between those goat-furred ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
It was tight, and warm. Something like a pussy, but so different. Theo&#39;s ass clenched around his cock, almost seeming to massage it. It was even better than it had been in that dream the first night. Then he met lips with Theo, their beards rasps together, he could feel Theo&#39;s furry chest pressed up against his. It was sensual in a way he had never experienced before. Where Amber had been soft and smooth, this was rough and hard, but no less pleasurable. <br />
<br />
Jory began to rock his hips, losing himself in the moment with Theo. It felt like an eternity they spent wrapped up together in the warm water, and not long enough at all before Jory was emptying his seed into Theo&#39;s tight ass. One more kiss passed between them before Theo pulled off of Jory&#39;s cock, and wonder of wonders, it actually began to soften. It didn&#39;t shrink though, just soften. What was once eight inches hard was now eight inches soft, an almost perfect match for Theo&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Jory pulled himself out of the water and sat on the edge of the bath, hefting his enlarged cock in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told ya.&quot; Theo said with a smirk. &quot;I have a theory it&#39;s also like other muscles. The more you use it during your changing time, the more impressive it will be. Speaking of..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are!&quot; Came Bruto&#39;s gruff voice. &quot;Good, nice and clean before I get you all sweaty again. Dry off and hop to it, we got stuff to do.&quot; Bruto was standing in the entrance to the baths, and Jory&#39;s eyes went wide. The satyr was completely naked, his lower goat half the same black as his hair. The scary part was what was between his legs though, he had no idea how any waist wrap could hide that monster. It must have been over a foot, and it wasn&#39;t even hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told ya.&quot; Theo said again with yet another smirk.<br />
<br />
Jory was hit in the face by a towel thrown by Bruto. &quot;Dry!&quot; He hopped out of the bath to comply, finding a place to set aside the towel befre following after Bruto, wondering what torture was in store for him.</p>
