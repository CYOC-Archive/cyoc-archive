<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Turning to Kellie, Katie didn’t notice any change yet from her once mother, now sister. So far, she could tell that her face was a bit fresher and her skin looked a little tan. But other then that, no other changes present. The 24-year-old Kellie looked to her little sister for a bit and asked, “What are you starring at shrimp?” Katie turned back and said in a polite tone, “Nothing… I’m just happy that you can take me to the beach today.” Kellie nodded and gave a deep sigh. “Thanks sis, it’s the least I can do. After all, this is going to be my last day for freedom before I start working as a lawyer. Total snoresville that’s for sure. I really need to start finding a nanny to keep watch for you when I’m at work.” Katie was a little hesitant and said to her sister, “But I’m thirteen! I’m too old for a babysitter!” “Well unless you want to get stuck with me in the office, I don’t know what else to do.” she said feeling a little aggravated over this. Katie though decided to ignore her and watched on as more changes happened.<br />
<br />
“Urgh… This music is so boring.” Kellie said as the elevator music was aggravating her she was listing to since she started driving. She started to change the station and picked up a pop channel that had an up beat. “There… That’s much better.” She said in pure enjoyment, “I swear if I hear another antique song again I’m going to tear my ears off.” Katie looked to her sister and could tell that she was looking a little fresher. And who could blame her; she was now twenty-three and was going through her senior year in college. She was also behaving like a college girl too as she tapped her fingers to the music and twirling her hair with her free hand. She seems to be more relaxed then before and was enjoying her life as a young adult. Katie could tell that she looked happier then when she was once her mother. As she was looking at Kellie, she notices something else off. For one, the car looked a little different. Sure, she was driving a Honda Civic, a typical mom’s car, but it looked like it was shifting a bit, looking sleeker and more powerful. She then look back to see a surfboard appearing in the back. It looked rugged and scratched up, like it has seen years of surfing. Katie’s guess is that Kellie’s own surfboard as new memories told her that she was a professional surfer before becoming a lawyer.  <br />
<br />
Kelly caught Katie staring at her and the 22 year old gave her a quizzical look.  &quot;What -are- you staring at tweeb?&quot;  Kellie said, using a typical term an older sibling might have for a preteen younger one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, nothing nothing...&quot;  Katie lied her eyes falling to her mother&#39;s diminishing breasts.  <br />
<br />
Kelly noticed her gaze and grinned, using her free arm to shift her mounds.  &quot;Not bad huh?  You shouldn&#39;t worry so much, you&#39;ll get some when your older.  I was like that when I was your age. I too was a little embarrassed at the fact that I looked like the teenage version of the ugly duckling. But as years passed, my ugliness faded and I have become the ravishing gal that I’ve grown to be. Give it a few years and maybe you can become as perfect as me.” <br />
<br />
Katie frowned.  Her mom was acting more and more abrasive the younger she became and the more her mind altered from mother to sister.  She was treating Katie very much like a nuisance she hadn&#39;t wanted to take to the beach.  Chances were, with the changes going on in Kelly&#39;s mind, that&#39;s exactly what her altered memories were telling her.  <br />
<br />
Katie could tell that that Kelly was looking radiant then ever. Going down a year, the now 21-year-old was feeling more energized then ever and felt like she was ready to take on the world. She even noticed the car their in shifting around as she could feel the seat getting more snuggled and the gauges and dashboard went from being old fashioned to almost digital. She could even feel the car going faster then normal as the engine shifting into something more powerful. Plus looking back, she could see Kellie’s surfboard looking less worn then before with lesser scratches. Katie could tell that reality is altering to match her mother’s age. <br />
<br />
Brushing a few of the radiant hairs out of her face, Kelly sighed. “You know,” she said with a little sultry sound to her voice, “I could bei going to the bar after I surf. Get some beer, meet some boys.  But no, I have to babysit you, squirt....” <br />
<br />
Katie winced.  Kellie was entering the alcohol phase of her life.  To her memory, she was experimenting with things to break the rules and boundaries, and having her younger sister along just made it so she was forced to be responsible.  <br />
<br />
Kellie watched as her mother regressed into 20-year-old young adult woman. She was looking more vibrant then ever and her skin was tight and darkened to a golden brown tan like hers. Her bikini was shifting to match her own and the sandals was growing a cork in the bottom heel and extending to four inches, looking as if it matches her swimwear. Even her hair grew a longer.   She noticed Kelly sulking and sighed.  &quot;Aww, come on Shrimpo...don&#39;t be so glum.  I can still meet guys even if you&#39;re there.  They might think your cute too, who knows, you might meet a little boyfriend...maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie let out a breath as her mother&#39;s memories of alchohol began to fade as she was becoming too young to drink.  Sure Kelly might have experimented with a thing or two..but she was supposed to be the responsible one.  The car shifted again now, Looking up, she noticed the roof of the car opening a hole and growing, exposing more of the warm air. She looked around and noticed that the car is continuing to change to match their age. It was changing to a sleeker, more durable, and fast model as the engine was sounding that it had a whole lot more horsepower then ever. Almost like the car is changing into something teenagers like to drive.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This mustang has a real kick&quot;  Kelly said.  &quot;Trust me.  Mom&#39;s inheritance was well spent when I bought it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now nineteen, her sister looked attractive as a young adult. She was vibrant, her skin is tanned, her boobs were round and bouncy, and her face was a beaut. She did look like she shaved off a few inches, but that means her height is pretty much even to her own, perfect for a twin status. Her swimsuit had become a strapless top and thong. Not only that, but a navel ring appeared on her belly button. <br />
<br />
The car had finished changing as they pulled into the parking lot at the beach.  The top opened fully, the windows went downward, and the car finished shifting. Now the car went from being an old, raggedy Honda Civic to a sleek and cherry red Mustang with black pinstripe.  Kelly turned off the ignition and grinned at her sister.  &quot;We&#39;re here kiddo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie stared in awe.  Where once had been a beautiful woman now sat an eighteen year old girl.   Her mother had been completely, utterly transformed into a teenager.  The resemblance between the two was only accentuated more as their ages had closed in.  In fact, Kelly looked like just an older version of what Katie might imagine herself to be at that age.  The teen looked at her quizzically.  &quot;What?  Something in my teeth?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head, &quot;no no!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well come on then, you&#39;ve pestered me to go to the beach for a week!  Let&#39;s go have some fun...just ...keep an eye out for boys alright?  And...pretend we&#39;re not related...&quot;  Kelly shut the door and moved slowly around to the trunk.  Katie sat for a moment utterly stunned.  She knew the changes weren&#39;t complete, but she didn&#39;t like this teenaged version of her mother.  She silently wished the change to move on to the next step...</p>
