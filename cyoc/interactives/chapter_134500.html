<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda quickly activated the chronovac, bathing Michelle and Frank in its invisible beam before tucking it away in her pocket. Looking at the two menacing adults she could see that in only moments neither would be a threat any longer.<br />
<br />
Already Michelle amd Frank were retreating from middle age. The two adulta rapidly left their 40s and reentered their 30s. The fine lines and grey hairs vanishing as they reclaimed their youth. Happily Amanda could see that neither seemed to be aware they were rapidly growing younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its no use trying to run Katherine,&quot; Michelle said smugly as she became 30. &quot;You know as well as I Ms. LaCrouix wont rest until the chronovac is back in her possession.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deanna gazed fearfully at the two adults. She had no idea who these people were but she could tell they were serious about acquiring the chronovac. As she watched them carefully her fear turned to wonder. Deanna could see that both were now rapidly becoming younger. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you gawking at kid,&quot; Michelle asked curiously. Deanna said nothing, merely gazing in wonder as the two adults became 25. <br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle,&quot; Frank whispered. &quot;Look!&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle paused, turning she gasped as she saw her partner. Frank was now a uoung man with dark hair and a youthful face. Gone were the grey hair and slight paunch she was accustomed too.  Instead the man was now a fit young man with an athletic body, dark hair and a smooth unlined face. As she continued to gaze at his facr she could see he was becoming younger by the second. The man was quickly becoming boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; she whispered. Quickly she noq turned towards a nearby window to lpok over her appearance. Gasping she could see she roo was growing younger as well.<br />
<br />
Michelle couldn&#39;t be older than 20 now. The girl in the mirror had a youthful and innocent face with long brown hair and a fit athletic body. As she ran her hamds over her body she noticed her breasts seemed perkier than before having lost the droop and fullness of middle age. Lookong between herself and Frank she could see the two of them reenter high school. Both now looked every bit the teenager. Lanky, youthful bodies replaced their former adult selves.<br />
<br />
18 uear old Michelle stormed over to where Deanna and Amanda stood, givong the two girla as stern a look as her teenage featurrs could muster. &quot;Okay who has it,&quot; she scowled, noticing her voice rising in pitch.<br />
<br />
Deanna and Amanda said nothing as the two teens continued to dwindle.<br />
<br />
18...17...16..<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon fix this,&quot; Frank whined, noticing he was now getting shorter, having relived a late growth spurt in reverse. Deanna gazed at the boy, noticing his face begining the transition from teen to tween as he grew younger. The boy now held his slacks up witb one hand as he became 15. The dark haired teen looked worried, as he continued growing shorter. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t very funny,&quot; he fumed, his voice cracking. 15 year old Michelle turned, supressing a giggle as she saw the lanky boy her partner had become. As she looked herself over she realized she wasnt faring much better.<br />
<br />
Although she had yet to relive a growth spurt in reverse she could see her curves were quickly melting away.  Michelles once proud breasts had been reduced to a pair of small b cups while her curvy hips were becoming less pronounced. Looking at her reflection she was startled to see a teen version of herself staring back. A teen that was rapidly racing towards childhood.<br />
<br />
15..14...13<br />
<br />
Michelle and Frank before began growing shorter as puberty reversed itself. The two watched in shock as the cuffs of their shirts began to swallow their hands. As the two looked at eachother they realized they were niw children themselves. Frank was a skinny boy with a youthful face while Michelle was a youmg girl with small conical breasts that were rapidly shrinki ng into her chest. Both now watched themselves closely, not paying attention to the two children in front of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Michelle,&quot; Frank gasped, his voice cracking before settling in a boys soprano. &quot;Look at you, your just a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me,&quot; Michelle exclaimed in a girlish tone. &quot;Look at you shrimp.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two watched as they became 12. Frank was a dark haired boy with a skinny body while Michelle was a young girl with barely flared hips and tiny breasts.  Frank giggled as he saw the young girl blush in embarassment as she held her clothes in place on her childiah body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure what your trying to cover up,&quot; he laughed. &quot;You dont look like you have alot going on up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelles eyes grew blurry with tears as she recalled taunts from her childhood. Out of instinct she kicked afrank in the shin causing her shoe to fly of her tiny foot and causing Frank to fall over, his too large pants falling to his ankles.<br />
<br />
12..11..10..<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats the matter shorty, &quot; Michelle taunted. &quot;Your mom give you the wrong size pants before you left home.&quot;<br />
<br />
9..8..7..<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you big meaney,&quot; Frank cried, wiping his eyes on his overly large sleeves. &quot;Make me,&quot; Michelle taunted sticking her tongue out. Frank lept to his feet, leaving his pants and shoes behind. Lunging at the 7 year old girl Frank knocked her backwards, causing the girl to fall out of her slacks and remaining heel. The two then stood up glaring eachother before giving chase to one another, their overly large shirts hanging to their knees and maintaining their modesty.<br />
<br />
Deanna turned slowly towards Amanda, a look of shock on her face. &quot;W..what happened to them,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Amanda smiled as she watched the two 7 year olds continue to fight. &quot;Their now 7 not only in body but in mind,&quot; she grinned. &quot;We wont have to worry about them again. Still I better cover our tracks or we might end up with more visitors from TransDem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deanna nodded numbly as Amanda began to cover up the fact Michelle and Frank had paid them a visit. Turning she could see Frank and Michelle continueing to argue like brother and sister,  wondering what else was in store for them that day.</p>
