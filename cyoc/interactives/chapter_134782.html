<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We could start out by talking with Ethel&#39;s drinking buddies.&quot; Said Luka as she looked at Ethel, her soon-to-be boyfriend, and maybe husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that you and Ethel will be the only ones to talk to them, the rest of us will go find other possible clues.&quot; Said Oliver as he looked at Celestia, who was preparing herself to see her friend, Luka sighed as she rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, before we go see them, i must ask you a few questions, so that we won&#39;t go there without finding possible answers.&quot; Started Luka as she looked at Ethel with serious eyes and a strict look on her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then go ahead.&quot; Replied Ethel as he crossed his arms while looking at Luka with a smile on his lips, Luka had to admit that Ethel was probably close with Karyu in terms of comedy, most of the time he would be the one to lighten up the mood of The Crew and The Entourage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did any of them act quite suspiciously?&quot; Asked Luka suddenly, &quot;Most of the times not showing up in the bar, having a certain charm and mostly needing private moments?&quot; continued Luka as she kept looking at Ethel who looked at one of the walls in the room, most likely thinking if any of his friends acted the same way.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one.&quot; Replied Ethel quickly as he looked at Luka, &quot;His name is Sol from what i remember, he&#39;s a Kilin just like me, he was given the name due to his golden eyes and white scales, he&#39;s not really in a strong position, he&#39;s just a simple cadet.&quot; started Ethel as he clicked his claw-like nails on the table, &quot;But he does have quite an area of influence, most of the girls would constantly look at his direction, he doesn&#39;t really show up with us most of the time, and he does have a tendancy to leave the bar whenever someone leaves.&quot; continued Ethel pausing from time to time, &quot;Today i will meet my buddies at a bar nearby, Sol said the he would join aswell.&quot; finished Ethel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then i guess i will join you.&quot; Stated Luka, &quot;But first, i&#39;ll have to change my appearance, if he would see me he would most likely recognize me.&quot; finished Luka as she went towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Luka and Ethel were walking around in the middle of the night in the peaceful streets of Aquaria, Luka changed her appearance into one of a beautiful Kilin woman with the same red scales as Ethel, while also changing the color of her eyes into a beautiful azure one,  walking around with the excuse of being his little sister, most of the time Luka would remain silent as she thought about the poem told by the sage to her, still trying to decipher what it meant, from time to time she would look around and at the edge of her peripheral vision she would sometimes see a snow white owl with blue eyes watching her, Karyu decided to go with Luka and Ethel, but to not attract too much attention, he became one with Luka&#39;s shadow using his powers as a demonic drake.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been really quiet.&quot; Said Ethel with a worried voice as he looked at Luka.<br />
<br />
Luka paused a little as she looked at Ethel, she was thinking about telling him what the sage told her in the forest, but it was way too personal, the only ones that could know this were Karyu and her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-It&#39;s nothing, i was just thinking about something.&quot; Replied Luka as she blushed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? And what were you thinking about?&quot; Asked Ethel with a smirk as he leaned closer to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;About you!&quot; Whispered Luka as she pulled him for a romantic kiss, Ethel quickly kissed her aswell, the two of them heard a small eldritch chuckle, most likely created by Karyu.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Luka and Ethel reached the bar, before entering it, Luka commanded a group of guards to remain in the shadows incase something happend, after that, she and Ethel entered the bar, where the red Kilin&#39;s buddies were drinking glasses of wine and mead, both of them were Kilins, one of them had sand yellow scales with green eyes and the other one had lime green scales with red eyes.<br />
<br />
Ethel and Luka sat near the two Kilins who greeted them, the bartender gave both Luka and Ethel a glass of wine as they started speaking and getting to know Luka.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who&#39;s the pretty lady right beside you?&quot; Asked the sand yellow Kilin, as he played a game of chess with Ethel, his eyes inspecting Luka&#39;s beautiful form.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s my sister, she currently finished her studies and became a priestess.&quot; Replied Ethel as he looked at Luka who quickly patted her on the head, just like a brother would to his little sister.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Sol came in the bar, Luka took a moment to look at the Kilin, his eyes were like two glimmering stars and the color of his scales looked like innocent clouds. Too bad that on the inside, the Kilin before her could be manipulator. Luka got to know Sol, just like Ethel told her, he did have the charm of a manipulator, but she didn&#39;t fall for it, she waited patiently for the chess game to end so that she could excuse herself from the scene. A few minutes have passed and Ethel won the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to pay the drinks.&quot; Proclaimed Ethel as he looked at the sand yellow Kilin with a cheeky smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now if you won&#39;t excuse me, i will head outside to take some fresh air, it feels like i&#39;m inside an oven.&quot; Said Luka as she slowly got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, would you like me to accompany you?&quot; Asked Sol politely, at this question, Luka nodded as the two of them headed outside, &quot;So, you&#39;re a priestess of the god of war, am i right?&quot; asked Sol as he looked at Luka.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is correct.&quot; Replied Luka with an adorable voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t take it as an offense, but your position isn&#39;t really... Noticeable.&quot; Stated Sol with an innocent voice, &quot;That&#39;s a weakness every kingdom has, nobody thinks that a simple bartender or maid has the ability to be the most effective spy.&quot; continued Sol his voice becoming more and more serious, &quot;This will be the downfall of the kingdom of Aquaria.&quot; finished Sol as he gave Luka a serious look, &quot;Luka, join the Cultists, at first i was a cadet in the military, i was barely noticed by my comrades, but when i joined the Cultists, i was given the power i needed.&quot; said Sol, trying to persuade Luka to join the Cultists.<br />
<br />
Luka smiled at this as she caught him red handed, &quot;Well, i appreciate the offer, but...&quot; started Luka as she clapped her hand two times, a group of guards came out of the shadows surrounding Sol, wielding spears that were inches away from him, with a quick gesture of her hand, Luka took off her disguise, &quot;Sol, you&#39;re under arrest for sharing information to terrorist groups and the presumed murder of three individuals, including the son of a lieutenant.&quot; stated Luka.<br />
<br />
At this, Sol laughed as one of the guards handcuffed him, &quot;You may arrest me general, but someone will take my position sooner or later.&quot; said Sol, only to then be knocked out by the same guard that handcuffed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we take him to the guillotine ma&#39;am?&quot; Asked one of the guards as he looked at Luka.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he possibly knows informations about those Cultists and other members that are inside this kingdom or other allied kingdoms, persuading most of the citizens into joining them.&quot; Replied Luka as she looked at Sol&#39;s unconscious body, &quot;Beat him up a little and prepare him in the interrogation chamber.&quot; commanded Luka, the guards quickly nodded as they took Sol inside the dephts of the castle.<br />
<br />
Ethel quickly headed outside and saw Luka with Karyu, &quot;So he was a member of the Cultists?&quot; asked Ethel with a worried voice, being quickly replied with a nod from Luka, at this Ethel sighed, &quot;He was a good friend of mine, i can&#39;t believe that he was a member of those lunatics.&quot; said Ethel as he looked down in sadness, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, if he is indeed a member of the Cultists then i will forget about him.&quot; finished Ethel as he looked at Luka with a determined look.</p>
