<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Continued commission. Sorry for the long delay!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah woke up the next day and went through her normal routine.<br />
<br />
She wanted to get going because she had an important swim meet today. Alex and herself would be doing a time trial in front of talent scouts from different colleges. While her number one goal was the Olympics, she was hoping that if she couldn’t make it now, that she could get scouted later in college. There wouldn’t be another opportunity like this again.<br />
<br />
Making sure that she ate a proper breakfast, she went back upstairs and finished doing her hair.<br />
<br />
She had long, curly brown hair that cascaded down her back in wild ringlets. That took work to pull off, and she was an avid swimmer, so keeping her hair soft and moist in the face of constant chlorine was a challenge. Hair done, she did a few morning stretches and drank her favorite protein shake and caught up on social media before the bus arrived.<br />
<br />
The bus came and she got on it like usual, sitting by herself in the back. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later, she arrived at school. As she passed through the doors, a tingle of static tickled through her body, making her pussy spasm. Sarah let out a gasp of pleasure and skipped a step on the stairs inside, almost falling over. Her vagina was wet and her legs slid sensually together as she awkwardly walked to the locker room.<br />
<br />
The closer she got to the locker room, the more the world seemed to grow distant and out of focus, almost like it was swirling away from her and then…<br />
<br />
She pushed open the door and everything was back to normal.  For a moment she almost worried that she was high – maybe her older sister trying to play a prank on her by slipping some weed oil in her coffee.  Or hell, maybe her sister just trying to give her something to relax before the big event later today.  But no, Lisa wasn’t that stupid and, in any event, Sarah hadn’t had anything to eat or drink this morning.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the feeling was mostly gone now, so she tried to ignore the slickness between her legs and made it into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Alexandra was already there, the front half of her body concealed by her opened locker. The blonde-haired girl was half naked as she fished out her swimming suit. Sarah liked the color, but thought her own ringlets were much more attractive, not that she’d ever tell Alexandra that. <br />
<br />
As Sarah walked by, the blonde girl turned to greet her.<br />
<br />
“Morning Sarah, ready for the time trial?” Alexandra asked.<br />
<br />
Sarah was about to respond but paused, staring at Alexandra’s breasts. <br />
<br />
Alexandra wasn’t wearing a bra, her smaller tits looking odd. The areolas looked smaller and her round breasts seemed stretched across her chest in a more square shape. Alexandra was fingering her nipples, which were leaking fluid.<br />
<br />
“Alexandra?” Sara eyed her friend as she rubbed her oddly firm breasts. “Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Mmm, yeah.” Alexandra breathed, massaging her breasts a little more, liquid trickling down her toned stomach, her eyes half lidded. “I walked into school and just felt… well, my body feels nice today.”<br />
<br />
Sarah thought back to the weird tingle and the slickness between her thighs. “Yeah, must be pre-trial jitters. I’m pretty turned on by it too.”<br />
<br />
Alexandra smiled and nodded and Sarah continued past her friend to her locker.<br />
<br />
Sarah opened her locker and started taking off her clothes. As she undid the bra strap on her back, the sudden loss of tension freed her breasts to drop down a bit, only for their natural elasticity to cause them to jolt back up, jiggling slightly. The flesh felt springy, like a rubber band. As the ripple passed into the back of her nipple, Sarah felt a twinge of pleasure and a flash of heat flow through her body.<br />
<br />
Her cunt got wet, her clit twitching strangely as her breasts continued to bounce. Sarah let out a moan, picturing her boyfriend fondling her breasts as she brought her hands up to cup her tits. She ran a finger over her nipple and hissed at the intensely pleasurable feelings that brought her. Her nipples felt so oddly sensitive, and warm liquid trickled down her stomach. <br />
<br />
She brought her other hand between her legs, fingering her throbbing clit. It felt swollen and even the lightest touch sent jolts of pleasure to her brain. She felt her legs quake as her hand schlicked inside of her. Her breast felt firmer, the skin stretching across her torso, deforming the roundness into something more square.<br />
<br />
Sarah gasped as her insides suddenly clenched and quivered as she came, fluids drooling across her fingers, her engorged clit twitching wildly. <br />
<br />
As the orgasm washed over her in pleasant waves, her nipples started to feel less and less sensitive. She brought her other hand up from her still-spasming pussy and flicked her nipple but felt nothing. Even stranger was the nipple itself. She looked to to confirm it. Sure enough, instead of the hard, nigh-erect protrusion she’d expected, instead it felt like a small swell, almost flush with the breast itself. <br />
<br />
She pushed down on her nipple and noticed there was a lot more resistance than usual. <br />
<br />
The flesh seemed to bounce one last time as she touched it. Instead of feeling the soft, fatty tissue under her probing fingers, instead she felt dense muscles. She looked in the mirror in her locker and saw that her breasts were now more appropriately designated as pecs. Very heavy and meaty pecs, if she were any judge.<br />
<br />
Sarah’s eyes slowly widened in horror as she stared at her disfigured body. <br />
<br />
“A-Alex?” She cried out, turning to her fellow swimmer.<br />
<br />
Alexandra turned, brushing the hair out of her eyes. Sarah’s eyes fell on Alex’s muscular pecs. They were huge and bounced with every movement he made. Alexandra looked down at her chest and then back at Sarah. <br />
<br />
“Checking out the goods?” Alexandra winked. “Didn’t pin you for a lesbo, Sarah.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Sarah stared at her friend, flabbergasted. “But I- You-” She tried to find the right words, collect her thoughts, her heart hammering in her chest. “Your breasts-”<br />
<br />
“They’re big, right?” She chuckled. With a smirk, Alexandra bounced a pec muscle. “You’re not so bad either in that department. Why? What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
Sarah frowned, sure there was something wrong, but Alexandra didn’t seem bothered. Had she been mistaken? She turned to her mirror and flexed her pectorals, watching the solid meat bounce and smiled, shaking her head.<br />
<br />
She must just have the pre-trial jitters.<br />
<br />
Sarah returned to her locker and pulled on her swim trunks. <br />
<br />
For a moment, she was confused. Wasn’t she supposed to wear a full suit? These were just tight shorts. And maybe not tight enough at that - as Sarah pulled them on, she couldn’t help but notice how roomy they were in the front. <br />
<br />
As Sarah wondered about the feeling of unease she had about her pants, a cool breeze wafted up and blew along her vagina. She let them go and immediately felt them begin to slip down her waist.<br />
<br />
Sarah grit her teeth and tied the strings around the waist into a tight bow before tucking it into her trunks. What the heck was going on with her today? Everything felt so off!<br />
<br />
By the time she was finished prepping her hair and getting it under the rubber cap, Alexandra had already left.<br />
<br />
She hurried out of the locker and met up with Alexandra. They walked together around the tiled floor through the showers to the Olympic sized pool. Surrounded by bleachers, it was the perfect arena for large swim competitions, but today’s time trial weren’t a competition and it was far too early for the talent scouts to be here. In fact, the only thing currently in the pool area were themselves and the echoes of their footsteps slapping against the tiles.<br />
<br />
“Where’s the scouts?” Alexandra looked around, confused.<br />
<br />
“They said they weren&#39;t coming until after lunch.” Sarah smiled as she jumped into the pool. “We have the morning to ourselves to practice! Let’s get in and do some warmups.”<br />
<br />
Sarah followed her in, then shivered - the ordinarily heated water was freezing cold, to the point that her now-flat nipples were rock hard and gooseflesh dimpled her skin. <br />
<br />
“Did they forget to turn the heater on?” Sarah asked, teeth chattering as she turned to Alexandra and saw something… peculiar.<br />
<br />
The lightly bronzed skin on Alex’s arms and face were growing even darker, while the skin on her chest and around her eyes was getting paler. Soon, a distinct black-and-white pattern had shaded Alexandra’s skin. Sarah stared at her as Alexandra turned to look at her in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Cold? What do you mean, it’s perfectly warm in here.” Alexandra replied.<br />
<br />
As Sarah returned Alexandra’s confused look, the water around her began to feel warmer, like someone had peed in it.<br />
<br />
Had she really just? She thought as she looked down at herself, half expecting to see a slight green tinge to the water around her waist.  But the gasp that came out of her mouth wasn’t from the color of the water, but the color of her skin - her chest was now bright white.<br />
<br />
And that wasn’t all. Sarah moved her hand to her stomach, only to see that the skin running form the tips of her fingers all the way to her shoulder was midnight black. As she examined her hand, she soon realized that it wasn’t a simple matter of a color shift, but the texture of her skin that had changed. It felt moist and rubbery and had a definite wet sheen to it.<br />
<br />
Wait, this was definitely different!<br />
<br />
Sarah knew for a fact they’d had normal skin tones before. Alexandra even used fake tanning solution and everyone made fun of her for her orange skin! There was no way this wasn’t different. This time, Alexandra would definitely notice!<br />
<br />
“Alexandra,” Sarah asked, “does something seem… different to you?”<br />
<br />
“No, what do you mean?” Alexandra replied.<br />
<br />
Sarah stared at her friend. “Your skin! It’s all different!”<br />
<br />
Alexandra glanced at her arms before looking back up at Sarah, the expression on her face one of concern. “Sarah, are you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Just… “ Sarah sputtered, shaking her head. “Okay, like, back in the locker room, our breasts-”<br />
<br />
“Pecs,” Alexandra corrected.<br />
<br />
Sarah blinked rapidly, “Right… sorry. What was I saying?”<br />
<br />
“Something about things being weird?” Alexandra crossed her arms under her heavy pecs. <br />
<br />
“Well, back in the locker room and now in the pool, I just have this… this sense that something is off about my body!” Sarah exclaimed. “It’s like… deja vu, you know? And whenever I think about what’s wrong, it’s like I can’t quite recall what that might be.”<br />
<br />
“Sarah,” Alexandra said, her voice stern, “you’re just getting jitters because of the time trials later today.”<br />
<br />
Sarah felt gaslit. It was like being the wife in a horror movie-she knew what she saw, dammit! And yet Alexandra was looking at her like she was crazy!<br />
<br />
Was she?<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Sarah conceded, but not quite believing it herself.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s concentrate on warm-ups. Get your mind off of things.” Alexandra replied.<br />
<br />
The next few hours passed by without incident. Sarah and Alexandra did some laps, then hung out by the sides of the pool. It was all very nice, though Sarah felt tingles rippling through her body the entire time. It wasn’t unpleasant-in fact, they actually felt pleasurable. But the constant arousal made the odd day even odder.<br />
<br />
Finally, Sara and Alexandra sat down beside the pool with their lunch.<br />
<br />
They ate chips and sandwiches, enjoying a soda and some water. For as crazy as the rest of the day had seemed, Sarah was relieved at how normal lunch felt.  That was until Alexandra placed her soda between her legs. Sarah’s eyes unconsciously followed the movement and she did a doubletake.<br />
<br />
Between Alexandra’s legs, there was a distinct bulge in the front of her trunks. It wasn’t very big, at least not at first, but Sarah swore it was growing larger as she watched<br />
<br />
“Whatcha staring at?” Alexandra asked as she lifted the soda to her lips, her voice a little deeper.<br />
<br />
“N-nothing!” Sarah blushed and tried to focus on her lunch, but her eyes kept getting drawn back to the now-sizeable bulge in Alexandra’s trunks.<br />
<br />
It was then that Sarah felt a line of warmth run from the top of her stomach down to her crotch.<br />
<br />
Sarah shifted uncomfortably, her clit feeling more puffy and swollen. She moaned as her clit throbbed and pulsed needily, feeling something shift inside of her. She spread her legs wantonly, feeling her insides squirm and clench, her groan of pleasure at the strangely-pleasant sensations growing deeper.<br />
<br />
She began to imagine Alex’s body, how big and muscular it was, how large his package was. Then she glanced at Alex’s big bulge again, her clit stiffening at the sight of the outline of his large cock in his swim trunks. That’s when her thoughts shifted from horny daydream to overt sexuality. She could see Alex naked, his big, stiff cock bobbing in the air, jutting from his crotch proudly. <br />
<br />
Her clit continued to throb, pressing against the fabric of her trunks, and she grunted deeply as two  somethings swelled underneath it, straining her trunks as they sagged heavily.<br />
<br />
Sarah closed his eyes, moaning as she finished her sexual fantasy. She could feel Alex grab her hips, press himself against her, then thrust deep into her ass. Sarah visually pictured him fucking her, each mental thrust causing her to grow more and more…<br />
<br />
Hard.<br />
<br />
Sarah snapped out of her lust fueled dream at the sudden feeling of her shorts tenting out against her huge cock. She looked down at her girthy member as it tented the fabric lewdly. He let out a moan as his package throbbed and swelled even larger.<br />
<br />
“Having a good daydream there, Sammy boy?” Alex said, smirking and staring at Sam’s crotch.<br />
<br />
Sam blushed.<br />
<br />
This time, he knew there was something off about this. His cock felt so foreign and alien, it’s a feeling he knew he’s never experienced before. For a brief moment, he tried to grasp the concept of what he should have in its place- a cunt?<br />
<br />
Yes, a moist, needy cunt, ready to take Alex’s cock all the way to the hilt before he ejaculated inside of her womb.<br />
<br />
Wait, no, there was still something wrong with that thought. Sam knew he should have a cunt, but he just couldn’t picture what it would feel like. Every time he tried to create a mental picture for what sensations he should be feeling from his lower body, all he could think of was how his erect cock felt.<br />
<br />
Dammit! <br />
<br />
Sam snarled mentally. It was so frustrating to have these kind of inexpressible feelings. His cock felt all wrong, of course, but it was still all he could think of. He clenched his ass, trying to simulate the mental feeling of a pussy by imaging the feeling of his clenched ass, but he knew, somehow, that it wasn’t even close to approximating the right sensation.<br />
<br />
“You okay, Sam?” Alex asked, raising a brow, breaking Sam out of his line of thought.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, uh, just had a strange feeling in my body there,” Sam said, blushing again as he glanced at Alex’s cock. “I think maybe I went a bit too hard with the warm-ups.”<br />
<br />
Sam unclenched his ass, feeling confused. What was he doing clenching it in the first place? There had been something off about him. But what could it possibly have been?<br />
<br />
He scanned over his body, but everything seemed to be normal. Big fat cock and huge bull balls, just like always. Sam wondered why he had felt so panicked earlier, but his train of thought was interrupted by Alex’s ringing phone<br />
<br />
The scouts were going to be another hour late. Sam sighed. Typical bullshit. Sam and Alex swam another couple of laps, taking it slow and leisurely.<br />
<br />
Sam swore Alex was growing larger, his already large muscles growing enormous, not to a ridiculous degree, but bulky and perfect for his nearly 7 foot tall form. He himself felt his muscles throb and swell while he was swimming. It was a nice sensation, like he’d done the best workout of his life.<br />
<br />
He flexed his muscles after a lap, enjoying the strain on his skin the thick slabs of meat put on them.<br />
<br />
Then, finally, the talent scouts wandered in, taking their time and getting seated on the bleachers. It was time for the exhibition to begin. <br />
<br />
A man stepped forward as the two high schoolers finished their warm-ups.<br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m with the Pacific University,” The man said, before gesturing towards the other people sitting in the bleachers.<br />
<br />
“Calvesity San Diego,” another pipped.<br />
<br />
“Calversity Davis,” said one who raised his hand in a sort of half wave.<br />
<br />
“Seaford.”<br />
<br />
“Chico Cal.”<br />
<br />
They all had the same middle aged, former jock look that Sam expected a men’s college swim coach to have.  Not that these were necessarily swim coaches – the big schools had dedicated scouts – but it was impossible to tell.<br />
<br />
“Its not often that this many scouts come out for just two swimmers, but we’ve heard good things about you two,” Saunders smiled slyly, “and the nearby Navy base.”<br />
<br />
Sam and Alex got to their lanes and waited as they both tried to calm their nerves. It was all happening so suddenly! He needed to be scouted now, not in four or five years! The Olympics was next year, this was his best shot. <br />
<br />
The PU scout blew a whistle. “Go!”<br />
<br />
Sam pushed off from the side of the pool. <br />
<br />
As Sam turned his head to take breaths, he noticed the talent scouts watching them. Oddly, he swore he could see one of them scratching his skin as a patch of shiny scales appeared on his neck. Another had fins growing form the underside of his throat. The PU scout himself appeared shorter and a scaled tail was pushing out of the back of his pants.<br />
<br />
 It was all so surreal that it threw Sam off of his already shaky groove.<br />
<br />
He finally finished in a terrible time, but he was too occupied staring at the anthropomorphic fish that were now watching them. The scouts’ cold, emotionless fish-eyes just stared at Sam and Alex as an unrecognizable scout read their scores in a burbly tone.<br />
<br />
“Terrible. Good thing for you, that was just the warm-up.“ The scout’s gills flapped uselessly in the air.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it is a good thing, because we honestly expected more,” Said a sturgeon-man sitting in the first row. <br />
<br />
Murmurs of agreement rippled through the row of scaly anthro-fish spectators.<br />
<br />
“Guys!” A very short, squat tuna-man suddenly spoke up, his fin hands fanning his face. “I-I feel hot here. I, uh, am just going to watch the next trial from the pool, okay?”<br />
<br />
“I think that’s a fabulous idea!” another scout burbled, staring at the other fish unblinkingly. “Why don’t we all get in?”<br />
<br />
The fish-men flopped into the pool eagerly.<br />
<br />
Sam stared as their bodies began to grow ever-more fish like, their heads and bodies streamlining. The scouts dipped down into the water, fanning their gills. Sam wondered how they were breathing chlorine, but quickly realized he could taste salt on his tongue whenever he swallowed water. Had the chlorinated water become sea water?<br />
<br />
It was all so crazy for Sam to even comprehend.<br />
<br />
“Okay boys!” One of the fish popped his head out of the water. “Let’s do another few sets, and this time… go faster, okay?”<br />
<br />
Saunders popped up out of the water just long enough to blow his whistle.<br />
<br />
Sam pushed off powerfully, but soon he was struggling against the water, his good start squandered. He was simply too massive to properly swim now. There was a reason skinny guys set records-there was a golden range of height-weight that was needed to win gold. He might be built like a brick shithouse with enormous muscles, but those muscles weighed a lot.<br />
<br />
As he slowed down, Sam felt a sudden, intense pressure in his back and between his cheeks. It felt like there was a heavy weight pressing down on all his muscles, preventing him from showing the scouts his true strength. He tried to think about his life and his future.<br />
<br />
Right now, his body felt incredibly heavy and tired. At the same time, it felt like something was trying to rip its way out of him. He wanted to stop, but he couldn’t. Not when he was so damn close to winning the time trial. <br />
<br />
Sam clenched his eyes, pressed his feet against the side of the pool, and focused all his energy into his legs as he pushed off. But instead of going to his feet, the energy pulsing through his body diverted itself to his spine, which exploded with new vertebra as a muscular, fluked tail shot out of the base of his hip.  Meanwhile, another burst of energy flowed into the space between his shoulder as rigid, sinuous flesh extruded out into a new dorsal fin..<br />
<br />
Pumping his new tail back and forth, Sam rocketed along the bottom of the pool.<br />
<br />
The plaster and tile floor below whooshed along by him. He felt a tightness in his lungs and slammed his hands against the bottom of the pool, causing his body to rocket up towards the surface.  But he only let his back just barely breach into the fresh air, blowing warm, moist air out of blowhole before allowing it to be replaced by an onrush of fresh, cool oxygen. <br />
<br />
Sam and Alex finished the time trial, swimming over to the stopwatch they had set up next to a camcorder.<br />
<br />
“Oh man!” Alex grinned excitedly. “We did it! We blew away that target time!”<br />
<br />
Sam cheered, his voice deep and bassy. “Fuck yeah, bro!”<br />
<br />
“We can send this video to any talent scout in the country.” Alex smiled, showing off his pointed teeth. <br />
<br />
They fist-bumped and Sam saw a flash of green dart by him.<br />
<br />
“Times like these call for a bit of snack, don’t you think?” Sam grinned.<br />
<br />
“Definitely,” Alex said, grinning at the water as a flash of green darted by him. <br />
<br />
The navy kept their training tank filled with fresh fish.  Not only were they nutritious, but chasing them down was a fun way to stay in shape.  Still, Sam couldn’t help but think that the fish that were delivered this afternoon were a bit plumper and slower than usual.  <br />
<br />
There was an odd hint of déjà vu as he chased after a particularly slow seabass.  But then his teeth sank into the fish’s soft flesh, the taste of salt and iron filled his mouth, and whatever thought had previously disturbed his mind was long gone.</p>
