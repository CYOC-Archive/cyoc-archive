<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We returned to the living room to find Pam and Carl waiting.  Scott and Joyce were still in the spare room.  Since Scott freely admitted that Joyce took the lead, I wondered how much of their encounters were similar to those of me and Rachel.  My mind was also preoccupied with what Rachel just told me.  I was open to her idea, I guessed.  She warned me it would sound weird and she was right.  It most certainly did.  But I promised I’d keep an open mind.  The bigger question was how Pam, Carl and Scott would take to the suggestion. <br />
 <br />
I gave Carl a once-over look to see if his changes had progressed further.  He noticed, naturally.  In typical Carl fashion he said, “Don’t stare too long.  I’d hate to see you and your sister fight over me.”<br />
 <br />
Pam looked at me and said teasingly, “You checking out my woman?”<br />
 <br />
“Oh, so I am a woman now?” asked Carl.  Obviously he was referring to Pam’s comments from a little while ago.<br />
 <br />
“Yes,” she said.  “I’ve seen what you’re hiding under that stupid shirt, you don’t have a dick anymore, and I guess you haven’t noticed that your face is changing now.”<br />
 <br />
“Is it?” he asked as he felt his face with his slender fingers and small hands.  “Yea, I guess it is.”  Rachel had told me that my cheeks felt rounder.  From what I could tell, Carl’s cheeks were getting rounder, too.  But I could also see differences in the sizes of his mouth, lips and nose.  His mouth and nose were a little smaller and his lips were a little fuller.  I thought his chin looked a little less prominent, too.<br />
 <br />
“I see your face is changing, too,” Pam said to me.<br />
 <br />
“Sure is,” I said.<br />
 <br />
“So is Scott’s,” said Joyce.  We turned again to see them re-enter the room.  They took their places on the couch.  I looked at Scott’s face and it appeared that the changes to his face had followed the same trend as mine and Carl’s. <br />
 <br />
“Did we miss anything?” asked Scott.<br />
 <br />
“You were about to,” said Carl.  He stood up from the couch.  “I want to say something.  You all wondered how this change would affect me.  How would a gay guy react to turning into a woman in what would be a world full of women?  I wondered myself.  I spent most of the day yesterday worried about that.  I was hung up on the fact that I was losing so much weight so quickly, as if that was a bad thing.  Well I want you to know that I’m happy with this change.  In fact, I’m more than happy.  I met this great girl here,” he said motioning to Pam.  “I’m sorry, I meant I met this great woman.  Right away she made me realize how much of an off-putting jerk I’d been.  She made me realize that I needed an attitude adjustment to go along with this physical change.  And if I may say so, she’s really helped make the physical change a lot more fun.”<br />
 <br />
Scott interrupted by saying, “Bow-chicka-bow-wow.”<br />
 <br />
Pam, to my surprise, looked neither annoyed nor embarrassed by Scott’s comment.  Carl chuckled and continued, “So I’m ready for everything to finish and start over again.  And that’s all thanks to Pam.  So here’s what is going to happen.  It’s time to really embrace being a woman.”  He clutched the top of his shirt in his hands and began to rip it apart.  It took a few seconds for the shirt to give way.  Once it did, it ripped perfectly down the middle all the way to the bottom.  In the process it revealed what were now somewhere between B and C-cup breasts.  It also fully revealed his womanhood.  Even though he had been bottomless, his loss of height had made the shirt too big for his body and so it had blocked that part of him from plain sight.  He took the ripped shirt off and flung it onto the pile of discarded clothes.  He was the first of us to go fully nude.  “So here I am, in all my naked female glory!” he said.<br />
 <br />
Pam stood up next to him.  She quickly unbuttoned her jeans and took them off as quickly as she could.  She, too, threw her jeans onto the clothes pile.  “And here’s me the same way!”  Yes, I still found it a little odd to see my sister completely naked, but by this point it also felt completely natural.  They wrapped their arms around each other and gave each other a little squeeze.  “Don’t we make a cute couple?” she asked.  We all chimed in with various acknowledgements that they did.<br />
 <br />
Carl said, “But there’s one last part to this.  I’ve decided…well, we’ve decided that since this is such a new beginning, and because it’s a new me, physically, mentally, attitude-wise, whatever, I am going to change my name.  From this moment forward, my name is…”  He looked at Pam and she gave him a smile and a nod.  He finished, “My name is Vanessa.”<br />
 <br />
I couldn’t say I was surprised by his choice in name because anything would have made and not made sense.  “How’d you pick that name?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
The newly christened Vanessa answered, “We talked about it and we both liked the sound of it, so that’s the one I’m going with.  And since I’ve changed my name now, you all better start referring to me as ‘she’ and ‘her’ and all that.  No more masculine names for me.”<br />
 <br />
I couldn’t argue with the logic.  I stood up and walked over to them.  I gave both of them a big hug.  I was honestly happy for them.  Sure everything was happening so fast, but I’d never seen my sister this happy and I’d certainly never seen Carl…er, Vanessa, so happy and so upbeat.  It seemed that they were getting fresh perspectives and finding what they wanted.  Since that seemed to be happening between all of us, I could only hope that everyone in the world was having this same kind of experience.<br />
 <br />
As I walked back to my seat, I almost tripped and fell down.  I looked down and saw that my socks had finally decided that they were too big and slipped down my much smaller feet.  “I honestly don’t know why I was still wearing these anyway,” I said.  I slipped them off completely and tossed them on the pile.  Now I was naked, too.  In an instant, Rachel, Scott and Joyce removed the rest of their clothes as well.  We had all finally reached the point of total nudity, as the wish granted.  “I think this calls for a toast!” I said.   We toasted to our nudity, to Vanessa’s new name and to everything still to come.</p>
