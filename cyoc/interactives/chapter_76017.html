<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The smoke hangs heavily in the air, making the room seem out of focus <br />
and surreal in the flickering light of the TV.  Your eyes swim around <br />
the room, vaguely registering at least half a dozen other guys in <br />
here, all pretty glazed over and in various states of undress.  One of <br />
the guys seems familiar, but your brain is heavy and slow and you <br />
can’t quite place him.  Meanwhile, your eyes are drawn back to the TV, <br />
swiveling of their own accord to focus on the flickering image. Given <br />
the haze and the fuzziness of the rest of the room, the TV is <br />
astoundingly clear:  Crisp, rich and deep.  You feel your eyes widen -<br />
- partially in surprise, partially to drink in more of the image.  The <br />
guy on the cartoon is nodding, and you feel your head bob a little in <br />
agreement.  He leans forward, nearer to the screen.<br />
<br />
Nod ... nod ... you lean forward too, your eyes feel so ... wide ... <br />
and yet only mildly uncomfortable.  It's a strange sensation.  Like <br />
the opposite of being Chinese.  In fact, they feel huge, and square.  <br />
You imagine they are assuming the shape of the TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ... weeird,&quot; you say.  Your eyes feeling flickery too, <br />
reflecting the TV, more than just optically.  <br />
<br />
The cartoon guy is saying, &quot;Hey.  It's happening to you, too, right?&quot;  <br />
Your eyebrows twitch and twitter, very confused.  Is he addressing <br />
you??  &quot;Yeah, you, man. It's cool.&quot;  <br />
<br />
What is ... you blink again, not sure how he knows what you’re <br />
thinking.  Your eyes are tempted to look back and forth for some sort <br />
of support.  <br />
<br />
The guy in the TV screen produces a big fat cartoon dutchie, drags, <br />
then glances around surreptitiously and gestures for you to approach.<br />
<br />
You have that sort of passive TV-watching mindset, where ... like if <br />
Tinkerbell were dying, you wouldn't clap your hands, because it's just <br />
a show.  Well, you might clap if there were children in the room ... <br />
hm, your mind's wandering, you think.  But it’s curious all the same, <br />
how he seems to be checking you out.<br />
<br />
The glowing j wanders into your periphery.  But he's a &quot;car...toooon,&quot; <br />
you protest. <br />
<br />
It bobs, it wiggles, it approaches.<br />
<br />
Your head bobs and wiggles too, as if it's tapping at your personal <br />
space... the doob, that is.  Its glow is hovering at eye level now, <br />
smoke streaming.  Your eyes cross slightly and focus on it... /pass <br />
... pass ... the trick is to pass ... /<br />
<br />
Your hand starts to rise -- it's more that you see it, rather than <br />
feel it or will it -- but then you remember you have to let it pass.  <br />
Or maybe you have to &quot;... pass ... it ...&quot; you think aloud.<br />
<br />
The hand holding it is down ... below ... so far below the glow, so <br />
... detached from the business end.  <br />
The smoke is wafting into your face and is almost textural as it moves <br />
over you.  You let out a light cough.  Until yesterday, you'd never <br />
smoked.  You need to move this along.  Your hand, low down, reaches <br />
above his, clasping it lightly, and you take the long roach clip <br />
stick, the glow before your eyes moving upward slightly as you remove <br />
it from his limp hand, which remains there as if forgotten.<br />
<br />
With great effort of concentration, you transfer it to your left hand, <br />
getting ready to pass it on.  The handle is warm and kinda soft, and <br />
the whole thing is strangely cantilevered.  You raise your hand to <br />
look more closely at the handle, drawn to inspect the unexpected <br />
texture.  Even as you move your hand to the left, the glow remains <br />
before your eyes, like a steadicam on its slow swivel.  No matter <br />
which way you move your hand, the various joints and arms of the <br />
armature swing and jerk, bringing the j nearer to your mouth. The more <br />
you try to pass it, the closer looms the smoldering fattie.  You have <br />
to resort to moving your mouth away from the j, rather than the other <br />
way around, as the thing's physics are beyond you to manipulate... <br />
your head moves slightly side to side, trying to avoid it.<br />
<br />
You realize that the way to pass is ... not to try and pass.  This is <br />
... &quot;fucking ... ridiculous...&quot;  you say, going a bit glazed as the <br />
thought suffuses your mind and drenches it in paradox.  Something must <br />
be fucking with your head.  The physics are impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking Ridiculous&quot; murmurs . . . .someone nearby.  Your eyes seek <br />
out the source, but the joint looms, attention split... wait ... are <br />
you ... was that your voice?<br />
<br />
So you are left to either pass, in which case you can't pass, or not <br />
try to pass in which case you are still not passing.  It gums up your <br />
brain, this situation.  You need ... grounding ... some help ... your <br />
eyes break the magnetic zone of the doob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zoone of the doob,&quot; comes a stoned sounding voice.  /How do they <br />
know?/ you wonder.<br />
<br />
...and a soft &quot;heh&quot; chuckle …<br />
<br />
...and a light cough.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you could pass it more quickly away, or get the next guy to <br />
take it from you… your eyes roam around the room, seeking a plan or <br />
some advice.  But these guys all seem pretty zonked.  Meanwhile the j <br />
is brushing lightly against your lips, a slow tick.... tock ... <br />
<br />
Your eyes swivel to your left.  If you can get his attention... your <br />
lips, something about your lips... they feel ... oddly ... heavy and <br />
slow.  The tip of the j scratches at your bottom lip, seeking entry.  <br />
Your tongue darts between your lips, stimulated by the slight tickly <br />
itch, and flicks the tip.  It draws out a tangible, standing stream of <br />
smoke, like pieces of plastic yarn adhered to your tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; you say, but it comes out tangled around your tongue as your <br />
eyes seek out the guy to your left, to pass to.  It feels like there <br />
are tiny hands gripping your tongue.<br />
<br />
The guy over there is sprawled and glazed and seems familiar ... that <br />
same feeling from earlier.  &quot;Hey...&quot; you repeat, nudging his knee with <br />
your knee with some sense of urgency.  He's grinning happily at the <br />
TV, zonked.  You scan his face and realize he kinda looks like you, <br />
but kinda  ... rougher.  Your neck cracks slightly as your head cocks <br />
in surprise, taking stock.<br />
<br />
His head swivels toward you, wobbly and glazed, his gaze oddly, <br />
unsettlingly vacant.  He has ... no ... irises?  You feel yourself in <br />
danger of falling into those eyes, and yet you chub slightly at the <br />
sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got this, uhhh...&quot; you try to articulate what you’re thinking.<br />
<br />
He grins, and nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta pass,&quot; he says, and you nod... exactly.  &quot;You just got here,” <br />
he explains.  “I'm later.&quot;  Your head cocks the other way, your eyes <br />
screwing up as you ponder what he's just said... more paradox.  &quot;I’m <br />
over there in an hour,&quot; he gestures vaguely.<br />
<br />
Against your will, your head swivels slowly in the direction of his <br />
vague gesture, noting his hands ... are ... different from yours ... <br />
your eyes follow his arm, hand, and further along to where he’s <br />
pointing, and see a younger guy.  Kinda street-punk-looking.   He's <br />
propped in the corner, kinda drooling and rubbing his hand around <br />
under his underwear, which is his only clothing.  You feel a little <br />
more blood surge into your cock as you watch him.  His tongue lolls <br />
out as he concentrates on pleasuring himself.  &quot;Wwwwowwwwwww...&quot; your <br />
voice is thick and slow...<br />
<br />
&quot;Course it changes as you change,&quot; the guy next to you says, <br />
effortlessly but so slow and thick... so much slower and thicker... <br />
and a murmur echoes around the room several times:  “pass.”<br />
<br />
You tear your eyes away from the guy in the corner, and your hand <br />
automatically reaches out to pass to your left on command.  The device <br />
inserts the doob deftly into your mouth.  It's a powerful impetus, <br />
that command from all around.  &quot;Nmmm...&quot; you protest, but dammit, <br />
moving your hand away only serves to wiggle it a little deeper.  It <br />
glows insistent before your eyes, the tip seeming miiiiles away, such <br />
a loooong ... loooong... the smoke begins to ooze out over your <br />
tongue.  &quot;Glkkn…&quot;  It inhales itself into you (is that what's <br />
happening?) the physical sensation, so ... odd ... backward, liquid <br />
and vapor at once, it is heavy thick and aromatic, like playing back <br />
an exhalation... backward, a perfect reflection of your own exhalation <br />
seconds later; it had to happen because it couldn't be undone without <br />
being done first.<br />
<br />
Your eyes seem to swell in their sockets, so heavy and big.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh,&quot; you hear them all moan around you ... as they have exactly <br />
the same thing alter, each to his own degree.  &quot;That'ssss newwww...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, that was,&quot; the guy on your left draws a deep breath.  &quot;Fucked <br />
uhhp.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn s s s s s l l l l l  o o o o o  o w w w w w w  l l l l l l y <br />
y y y yy y, and follow the doob with your eyes as it wiggles away, <br />
tick ... swoooosh ... tock -- to face yourself.  &quot;Iiiiyou should <br />
stop,&quot; you say to yourself, as a reminder to your future self, like <br />
jettisoning an escape pod in hopes someone will find it later.  You <br />
realize you are now to the left of where you thought, and you are <br />
looking at this guy, who's sitting where you were ... just ... now.  <br />
Your hand comes to rest softly in his lap.<br />
<br />
The weed takes hold, and your head tips ... slowly ... back ... <br />
against the head rest of the couch... staring at the ceiling / wall <br />
corner ahead.  You feel yourself sinking downward and swelling upward,<br />
expanding and dissipating.  &quot;Mmmmnnnnn,&quot; you moan in a whisper...<br />
<br />
Shit ... but if he takes a hit ... and he's you ... you ponder this as <br />
you continue to stare at the wall...<br />
<br />
You hear the guy to your left saying, &quot;Fucking ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking ridiculous,&quot; you echo, grinning, remembering...<br />
<br />
Wait ... the TV ... different from different angles...<br />
You see he has the roach clip now, and is maneuvering unsuccessfully.  <br />
Wait, no, he needs to not ... he really ... &quot;Need to pass,&quot; you say <br />
aloud... but ... fuck.  If he passes to the next guy ... then you'll <br />
be that much further gone when you take the hit, which means ... <br />
<br />
There is a sinking feeling as you realize no matter where or how or <br />
when he passes (or doesn’t) it won't matter.  You're all you.  Which, <br />
coincidentally is the name of the show now flickering away its title <br />
before you.  &quot;You're all you!” it announces brightly.<br />
<br />
What's worse is ... you kinda wish you had it to smoke right now.  <br />
This does not bode well.  <br />
<br />
You notice the “You’re All You!” titles just fading away, and get <br />
sucked into the TV, and nod.  You figured that out.  And we're all <br />
stoned.  You figured that out, too.  You realize that a hit has been <br />
taken, because you are aware of another shift in your position and the <br />
feeling of a scruffy goatee on your chin.  Briefly your mind wanders <br />
to what it'd be like if two of you made out ... it'd be so hot once <br />
... and twice ... knowing ... you blink and shake off the image.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ... fuck dude, doon’t...&quot; you call to yourself, vaguely...<br />
<br />
You also know a hit has been taken because the cloud floats by the <br />
screen... someone nearby.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Pot.&quot; says the TV.<br />
<br />
You ponder whether this a single loop that repeats, or is somehow <br />
cyclical, or spiral ... where do you end up, at the end ... is there <br />
an end?  Maybe you can get out where you came in . . . ?  You should <br />
... just ... not smoke from here on in.  Then all the future yous ... <br />
only the one newcomer will be --<br />
<br />
The TV has other ideas, though.  Now that you are nearer to it, you <br />
have become aware of the soundtrack of the show.  It’s a strange, <br />
pulsating music that is overtly erotic in some sense you never knew <br />
existed.  You start zonking out listening to it ... your head <br />
bobbing...<br />
<br />
[]<br />
<br />
Like it's groping you.  Invading you.  You want it to have you...  <br />
just give it you ... <br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking Ridiculous,” Past You is saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking Ridiculous&quot; comes the echo from somewhere diagonally opposite <br />
you.<br />
<br />
You know you should be stopping it, but it's all a dream anyway, <br />
right?  Your shirt has at some point been removed, and your hand <br />
strays to play with the chunky metal hoop in your nip, jangling your <br />
nipple nerves in wonderful new ways.  You feel your arousal swell, <br />
merging with the throbbing music.  You just wish you had the fucking <br />
joint ... or something!<br />
<br />
Now in a new corner, you survey the room.  The original You has just <br />
come in, of course.  The blobs of colored light from the lava lamps <br />
give the whole place a surreal, disjointed feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; you say, weakly.<br />
But you realize that you are not interested in stopping him now; his <br />
toke will ultimately affect you, and you are totally into that idea.  <br />
Instead, you chuckle softly and enjoy the show.  What you wouldn’t <br />
give for a j of your own . . . &quot;Take a hit,&quot; you whisper, <br />
subliminally...<br />
<br />
You realize several of these . . . versions have their own supply, and <br />
you’re actually a bit put out that they have them and you ... mmm ... <br />
don’t … but they're yummy to watch.  The guy over there has a big <br />
phallic hookah.  He fellates the hose ardently, smoke cumming out.  <br />
Then there's that one, with a similar, larger hookah, but he seems to <br />
have grown an appendage which serves as his private hose, the end of <br />
which licks and laps at the central chamber … with a mix of envy and <br />
satisfaction that seems paradoxical, you think it’s all fine … you’ll <br />
get there sometime.  After all, You’re All You.</p>
