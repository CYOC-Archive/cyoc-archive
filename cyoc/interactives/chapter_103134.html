<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What the hell, I’m awake now anyway” I said, shrugging my meaty shoulders. <br />
<br />
“That’s the spirit” said Runt with glee.<br />
<br />
I walked through my apartment. It was bigger then my old one, with the living room attached to the kitchen, and past there, a bedroom and bathroom. It was modestly furnished, a small flat screen tv, wooden coffee table, a leather couch.<br />
<br />
I pulled off my t-shirt, looking at myself in the mirror. I gave a few flexes, smiling to myself. As I worked out often, I kept track of my measurements, 18ich biceps, 45inch chest, and 213lbs. I flexed my big hairy chest, watching the mounds of muscle tense.<br />
<br />
“All right big guy, lets get this show on the road” said Runt, who was already spread out on the coach, jacking off using my real cock.<br />
<br />
“Your gonna use my real body to do this?” I asked, folding my huge arms, my biceps pressing my pecs together.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, maybe with a few upgrades” he replied, before his cock began to grow with every stroke. As I watched the once average tool become a huge 12 inch one, I felt my mouth begin to water, my own cock growing hard in my boxers.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying the show?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Well… that’s mighty impressive kid” I said in awe, as I began to stroke my own thick 10 and a half-inch daddy cock through my boxers.<br />
<br />
“Come over here Joel, I got a little something for ya”<br />
<br />
“Heh, sure it’s little?” I joked, walking up to him.<br />
<br />
“Funny man” smirked the imp, before grabbing the front of my boxers. Instantly the material changed from cotton to shiny black leather, as it began to stretch and grow down my big muscular hairy thighs, past my diamond shaped calves, to my ankles, forming skin-tight leather pants. <br />
<br />
The crotch and seat also opened up, exposing my round hairy ass and my big daddy cock, so I was now wearing leather chaps, with a thick leather belt with a huge silver buckle, depicting a bison skull. On my cock was a large silver cock ring, my big hairy balls tied with a leather strap. A pair of matching big black pointed cowboy boots appeared on my size 14 feet, complete with spurs.<br />
<br />
“Well… Damn” I said, looking at my legs.<br />
<br />
“Not done yet” grinned Runt, before reaching up and pinching my nipples.<br />
<br />
“Arghh.. gahd.. yeah” I gritted my teeth, feeling pleasure in the pain. “Harder”<br />
<br />
“In a second… there we go”<br />
<br />
I looked down to see I was wearing a black leather cowboy vest, unbuttoned. Around my biceps were black leather armbands, with matching cowboy gloves on my hands, when Runt removed his fingers, I realised I now had pierced nipples, a silver bar in each.<br />
<br />
“Finishing touch” said Runt. <br />
<br />
He pulled a black cowboy hat out of nowhere, and put it on my head, as a lit roll up appeared in my mouth. I turned to look at the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Damn…” I said, taking a puff. “Nice work kid”<br />
<br />
“Thanks. You look good as a cowboy,” said Runt, admiring his handy work. “You ever dressed up like that before?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yeah… although that was when I was back on my dad’s ranch” I explained, turning back to face Runt. “You know… but with less leather, and with a shirt…” I turned back to the mirror “…and pants”.<br />
<br />
“I think…” Runt then grabbed the back of my belt and pulled me towards him with surprising strength. “You look better with out”.<br />
<br />
He then pushed my cheeks apart and dug his face into my exposed asshole and began eating me out.<br />
<br />
“Woah there…” I said, surprised at the wet tongue licking around my anus.<br />
<br />
“Taste good too…” came his muffled voice. “Ripe and sweaty, just enough musk”<br />
<br />
“Glad you… ahhh…approve”<br />
<br />
I gasped as I felt his tongue go deeper in my ass, it seemed impossibly long as it snaked it’s way in.<br />
<br />
“Grrahhhh… yeah… that’s the stuff” I said, as I began to move my hips back and forth. I then let out a moan as I felt his tongue lick back and forth on my prostate. I jacked off my cock with every thrust, grunting and groaning as Runt’s tongue invaded my anal cavity. He then pulled out, making me gasp sharply.<br />
<br />
“Lie down on the couch big guy, I got more where that came from”<br />
<br />
“Yessir” I replied, tilting my hat. I laid down on the couch next to him on my back, legs spread open, my thick daddy cock rock hard in the air, as I teased my cock head, pushing my foreskin back and forth, pre-cum oozing from the tip.<br />
<br />
Runt then pushed my legs foreword and placed his face back over my ass. I felt his tongue then slip back into me and snake its way in to continue pleasuring my g-spot.<br />
<br />
“Ahhghh... oh Jesus… don’t stop” I breathed heavily, throwing my head back. I felt a pang of guilt when as I was raised a loyal Christian, but since I realised my sexuality, I felt I didn’t have a place in a church anymore. But it didn’t matter now.<br />
<br />
He then removed his tongue and sat up, before lining his huge foot long with my anus. <br />
<br />
“Ready?” he smirked.<br />
<br />
“Do it kid… I’m hell as ready”<br />
<br />
He pressed his cock head against my asshole, twitching with anticipation, before slowly pushing it in.<br />
<br />
“Ohh God… fuck yeah” I yelled, feeling the massive organ slowly slide into me, then out, then in again. I lifted up my legs, pulling my arms around them so my knees were by my ears, as I began to rock back and forth, the huge cock going deeper into me.<br />
<br />
“C’mon…. faster” I breathed between grunts and moans. I grabbed my dripping cock and began furiously beating it. I had no idea how such a massive cock was fitting inside me, but I didn’t care, it felt too good.<br />
<br />
Runt then picked up the tempo, fucking me balls deep. I groaned and threw my head back, closing my eyes to enjoy the sensation. All I could here was the slapping noise of his balls hitting my ass as I continued to jack my cock. I paused to lick the cum off my gloved hand, before moving it back to tease the base of my cock, massaging my big hairy balls.<br />
<br />
Runt went faster and deeper, pushing me over the edge into ecstasy, until I couldn’t hold on any longer, moaning loud as I squirted white hot cum over my huge hairy chest, and further up to my neck and mouth. At that moment, I felt my bowels flood with Runts load, as it was pumped into my anus, filling me up.<br />
<br />
He pulled out, a flood of cum spurting out of my anus as his cock left my tight ring. <br />
<br />
“That was…” I panted, my face red. “That was…”<br />
<br />
“Told you I was good” said Runt with a cocky smile. I watched as his body shifted from my old one, to his normal form. He hadn’t even broken a sweat.  “Need a moment to recover?”<br />
<br />
“No… I’m good.” I replied, sitting up. “Do all demons fuck that good?”<br />
<br />
“Told you I’m an imp,” said Runt rolling his eyes. “And yes, most of us do. We live for a long time, so we have a lot of time to learn”<br />
<br />
“How long have you been around for?” I asked, leaning forward on my knees.<br />
<br />
“Lets just say I once had the pleasure of fucking Mark Antony” he replied casually. “And he wasn’t so… boastful after I finished with him”.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that is a long time”<br />
<br />
Speaking of time, I looked at my watch. It read half 5 in the morning. Sunlight was coming through the window.<br />
<br />
“Guess I should get ready for the gym. Maybe take a shower first” I looked down at the now sweaty leather cowboy outfit, half expecting it to disappear.<br />
 <br />
“You can keep the outfit,” said Runt, lying casually on the couch, a satisfied smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Much obliged” I thanked, taking off the hat as I headed to the shower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taking off the clothes, I turned to the bathroom mirror. Leaning on the counter I examined my nipple piercings, before placing a hand to my beard, wondering if it was time for a trim.<br />
<br />
“You should keep it, suits you”<br />
<br />
I turned to see Runt sitting on the counter next to me.<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing privacy doesn’t mean much to you does it”<br />
<br />
“You have to much of it big guy”<br />
<br />
I nodded, shrugging my shoulders. He was right there.<br />
<br />
“I suppose your right, I don’t get out as much as I used to” I said, getting in the shower. I turned the knob and let the warm water run down my face. Runt lay back on the counter casually, watching my ass as I showered.<br />
<br />
“So there a reason you came to watch me or…” I asked, lifting my arm to wash my hairy armpit.<br />
<br />
“No not really…” <br />
<br />
“I thought as much” <br />
<br />
“Come to think of it…” said Runt, pausing for thought. “There is the matter of my payment so to speak”<br />
<br />
My brow furrowed, as I rubbed soap into my chest hair.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah… you said about that. I don’t have money if that’s what you’re getting at”<br />
<br />
“Pfft.... what would I need money for” replied Runt, waving his hand dismissively. “I’m talking about entertainment value, so we both get something out of this”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh” I said, washing down my cock, before turning to do my ass. “What kind of entertainment?”<br />
<br />
“Oh nothing too freaky or anything” answered Runt. My brow furrowed again at the vague answer.<br />
<br />
“I thought you were gonna be taking care of my old life?” I asked, raising an eyebrow sceptically. I turned off the water, and began to towel myself down.<br />
<br />
“Oh I will, but that doesn’t mean I can’t keep an eye on your sexy self” continued Runt. “It’s just to spice up your day-to-day so to speak. Hell you might even enjoy it”<br />
<br />
“Okay… name your price,” I said, stepping out of the shower with the towel round my shoulders.</p>
