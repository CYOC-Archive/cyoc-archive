<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana had just finished cleaning her shop when another customer came in, it was a man in jogging clothes and he was accompanied by a dog which he was holding a leash on. He started looking around the store, but because he wasn&#39;t didn&#39;t stay in a specific part, she didn&#39;t know what he wanted, so she asked &quot;Hi. You seem to be undecided, if you want you can just tell me what you are looking for and I will be able to help you choose what best fits your wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry I didn&#39;t know there was a mutant working here so I thought you were just another customer. Turns out my sex life with my wife is stagnant and I was looking to see if I can find something to spice up our relationship. I wanted to do this as a surprise for our wedding anniversary, so I&#39;m taking advantage of walking my neighbor&#39;s dog who is traveling to stop by here at the store.&quot; the man said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... sometimes people like you come along. I have something in mind, but first I need to know what you and your wife think about mutants.&quot; Diana said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see any problem with them, and neither does my wife. I actually have a mutant niece, she&#39;s a chocolate girl and we get along really well.&quot; the man said<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. So what would you or your wife think of the possibility of becoming mutants?&quot; Diana asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...now that you mention it I realize I never thought about it. Since it&#39;s impossible for me to become a mutant I never worried about it.&quot; the mas said<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I told you this is possible now? I have some new aphrodisiacs that permanently mutate people, and today I&#39;m handing out free samples to interested customers. So, would you like to try it?&quot; Diana said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. The idea sounds interesting to me, but I don&#39;t know what my wife will say if I do it without talking to her, maybe later.&quot; the man said<br />
<br />
&quot;But then you will spoil the fun. You said before that you wanted to surprise her for her wedding anniversary, so it would be best if you tried it on before seeing her again.&quot; Diana said<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right. I&#39;ll give it a try, maybe it&#39;s what we need to rekindle the flame of passion between us.&quot; the man said<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, but I would like you to try it here in the store, it can serve as some publicity. I also recommend that you take off your clothes, they can be destroyed with your transformation.&quot; Diana said<br />
<br />
The man received the pill and thought of taking it without taking his clothes off, as even if they were not destroyed they would be useless for him later. When he took his hand with the pill to his mouth, the dog jumped on him, disturbing him and causing him to drop the pill on the floor, as well as his wallet that slipped out of his pocket and fell open allowing them to see his ID Card, letting Diana see that his name was Oswald.<br />
<br />
Diana couldn&#39;t help but think it was a little funny, but to sound professional she chuckled with her other bodies who were Jen and the others in the warehouse negotiating the last few details as she watched the customer search for the dropped pill.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the fun?&quot; Mrs Watson asked<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a shopper at the store with a dog, the animal made him drop one of the aphrodisiacs and now he&#39;s looking on the floor for it.&quot; One of Diana&#39;s bodies said<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s good to find it first, as it works on animals too.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
Having the information to Diana in the store, she opened her mouth to give the warning, but it was too late and the dog already had the pill in her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fifi, drop this pill. This is not for...&quot; Oswald said, but the dog swallowed the pill.<br />
<br />
Oswald and Diana could only watch as the female Belgian shepherd changed. <br />
<br />
Fifi&#39;s neck got longer, but instead of growing more fur on it, it was the fur on her head that fell out completely. Her neck widened (breaking her collar) and her muzzle retracted as her skin looked more and more human. When her neck was wide enough in two of the upper curves a pair of human arms grew and, not far away, a pair of breasts grew until they became perky E-cups. Her head also became fully human, with the countenance of a very pretty girl, while red hair grew on her head until it reached the height of her shoulders. The finishing touch came with her canine vagina growing and changing into a human ballsack accompanied by a 10 inch human cock. Oswald&#39;s neighbor&#39;s dog was now a shemale dogtaur.<br />
<br />
As soon as her transformation was completed, Fifi looked around and at herself confused and not understanding the extent of what had happened to her. She then looked down and saw her hard cock, but she had never seen a human cock before and didn&#39;t know what it was, much less what it was for nor how it was used.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifi&quot; Oswald called the dogtaur, who thought he was going to get scolded, and ran for the back door. The man tried to run after her, but the difference in speed was too great and he couldn&#39;t do anything.<br />
<br />
Soon Fifi arrived at the warehouse, where everyone saw her stop at the entrance, where she was sniffing the air as if she had noticed some interesting smell. When she stopped sniffing she looked at Lucy and ran towards her, jumping on her and dropping her to sniff her up close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think she realized that Lucy was originally a dog too?&quot; Claire whispered to Jen<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I have no idea how the curse works on animals.&quot; Jen whispered back.<br />
<br />
Oswald arrived at the warehouse and went quickly to take Fifi off Lucy, but the dogtaur was reluctant and growled at him, because while she was there the tip of her dick rubbed against Lucy&#39;s leg and she had discovered a very good new feeling that came from there, so she didn&#39;t want to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let her do what she wants, I believe she will collaborate more when she is satisfied.&quot; Lucy said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have been careless. Because of me you are in this situation.&quot; Oswald said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, it&#39;s not as bad as you think.&quot; Lucy said as Fifi continued to rub her cock against her, moving more and more and eventually the tip reached her mouth.<br />
<br />
Fifi liked even more the feeling she had when her cock touched the mutant&#39;s mouth beneath her, she seemed to be understanding part of the functioning of her new member and pushed it inside, putting everything inside.<br />
<br />
Lucy was enjoying it all, but Frieda, being immobile as a teddy bear woman, became jealous and asked someone to help her hook up with her &#39;owner&#39;. Mrs Watson was busy stroking her wife between her legs so Jen and Claire grabbed the teddy bear woman and lifted her up, positioning her on top of Lucy adjusting her cock with the ex-dog&#39;s pussyface, helping her to penetrate.<br />
<br />
Fifi, invaded by so many new sensations, came, but she liked what she felt so much that as soon as her orgasm ended, she went back to thrust.<br />
<br />
Lucy loved the experience, especially after one of Diana&#39;s bodies came to her side and started stroking her 4 hard dicknipples. She didn&#39;t last much longer after that and came, the contractions of her pussymouth causing Frieda to reach her orgasm too. Fifi didn&#39;t seem to mind that and continued to fuck her mouth until she reached her second orgasm, which left the dogtaur panting and a little tired.<br />
<br />
Oswald now had no problems and the dogtaur, already satisfied, obeyed him, who didn&#39;t know what the owner of Fifi would think when she found out what had happened to her pet dog.</p>
