<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the week pretty much went the same as the first day. Jen would wake up, eat, visit the yard (she was becoming used to the other dogs now), morning lessons, lunch, visit the yard again, afternoon lessons, training in the side yard, dinner, sleep. She fell easily into the routine, even her daily bowel movement was no problem to her, just another step in her daily tasks. Mina was the only thing that still surprised her. Every time she delivered a meal Jen could hear the telltale buzzing and see the glazed look in her eyes and twice more she woke up at night to find the girl masturbating outside her cage though now she seemed to have a dildo with her. Jen didn&#39;t know what to do. Several times she considered breaking her silence and risking punishment to report her to Amelia but she always chickened out. Then on the eighth day of her training she woke up to find one of the other carers delivering her breakfast.<br />
<br />
Jen looked up at her quizzically, tilting her head just like a dog would. She had picked up a small handful of doggyish habits over the past week. The carer, a middle-aged woman named Alice, just shook her head and filled her bowl with eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not allowed to gossip,&quot; she whispered, &quot;but I think you&#39;ll find out soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t push the issue. It was clearly a people problem and she was becoming less of a person and more of a dog now. She ate her first bowl and waited patiently while Alice refilled it before emptying it again. She expected Amelia to come in as she finished her second helping like she always did but she never arrived. Instead Alice opened the cage and attached her leash to take her to the yard. Jen was confused but followed along obediently. As they walked down the halls they passed a couple groups of carers and trainers who were whispering furiously. Alice clicked her tongue at them and they dispersed with guilty looks.<br />
<br />
Once in the yard Jen took care of her morning pee and went to one of the many toys lying around. She had been thinking about playing with them for a couple of days now but was never able to get the courage. Now she selected a small rubber ball and, without even considering how unsanitary it might be, she picked it up in her mouth and carried it to Alice. She looked down and laughed when Jen dropped it at her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to play fetch huh? Finally feel like trying to play like a real dog? Alright, let&#39;s play!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice picked up the ball and threw it across the yard. Jen went chasing after it as fast as she could crawl. The daily sessions in the side yard had made a difference. She could achieve a sort of lumbering run that was quicker than her normal crawl, but still far slower than an actual dog could run. She retrieved the ball and brought it back to the carer who threw it several more times. Jen was having so much fun that she didn&#39;t even notice when the ball was thrown over the bushes into the part of the yard where the boys could see her, she just chased it down and carried it back as if she didn&#39;t have an audience of three male trainers and their suddenly barking dogs. Their game of fetch ended when the other dogs were brought out. Try as she might Jen had no hope of keeping up with them when the ball was thrown. Tired from her short bout of exercise, she lay down on the grass next to Alice who absentmindedly reached down and began rubbing her belly. Jen had come to love belly rubs, something about them just made her feel all warm and fuzzy inside. She lounged on her back while the woman rubbed, not caring when her hand wandered to high and crossed her bare breasts or drifted down into her pubes.<br />
<br />
When it came time for morning lessons and Amelia still hadn&#39;t appeared she started to become worried. When one of the other trainers came out and put her leash on she whined at her in a near perfect imitation of an upset dog. The trainer gave her a sad smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;Ms. Lockehart is really busy this morning. Something came up last night and she&#39;s still dealing with it so she&#39;s having me take over training you for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen whined again but allowed herself to be led to the classroom for morning lessons. She should have expected something like this, she realized. All of the other trainers rotated what dogs they were training on a daily basis. It made sense that Amelia would eventually pass her onto another trainer. Especially since she was doing so well. She breezed her way through the lesson, barely paying attention and letting her body just obey the commands her ears heard. At the end of the lesson Alice came to take her to the kennel for lunch.<br />
<br />
As they approached the door to the kennel they heard a commotion from inside. Jen was confused. The other dogs only got fed twice a day. She was the only one that got a lunch because she needed the extra calories. There shouldn&#39;t be anyone in the kennel except her and whatever carer had been assigned to feed her. As they walked through the door Jen was surprised to see both Amelia and Betty standing outside the cage across from hers. They both looked up as the two entered and Amelia looked at her watch with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noon already?&quot; she muttered, &quot;Where did the morning go. No matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty had dashed past her boss and started rubbing Jen&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girl,&quot; she trilled, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you all week! I tried to find some time but the male wing seems to have broken out in a minor flea infestation. You ladies haven&#39;t seen any over here have you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alice responded, &quot;Haven&#39;t seen a single one in months. How did the outbreak happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Joseph Catterly brought his hounds straight here after hunting so he could take off for Cancun with his mistress. One of the other dogs in his hunting club must have had them and we missed them during intake. I&#39;m thinking I might have to move all the males into the classrooms for a couple of days so I can bomb the kennel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty gave her a sour look and went back to petting Jen who had rolled onto her back so her tummy could be rubbed. Betty just laughed and started rubbing vigorously with both hands. Amelia walked up to Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for looking after Jen this morning. I did not expect to have to deal with this today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Alice asked, curious. &quot;I mean, I heard the rumors but they seem pretty exaggerated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come see for yourself.&quot; Amelia sighed and walked back over to the cage she had been standing in front of when they entered.<br />
<br />
Curious herself, Jen rolled back onto all fours and trotted after them. Alice got there first and simply groaned while covering her face with a hand. Jen had to push around her to see. She almost gasped out loud when she saw the occupant of the cage.<br />
<br />
It was Mina. Jen almost didn&#39;t recognize her. She had been stripped naked and was wearing gloves and pads just like the ones Jen wore. Her long fiery locks had been shorn down to a few inches like Jen&#39;s was and her thick patch of orange pubes had been trimmed down as well. She was lying on her back on the dog bed and moaning while she thrust her hips repeatedly into the air. A large vibrator was stuck into her pussy, it&#39;s girth spreading her lips wide. Jen could hear it buzzing away. It was louder than the one she had hidden under her skirt and clearly more powerful. Jen wondered why her moans sounded so muffled and looked at her face. She was wearing a ball gag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering what she got up to at night after everyone had left.&quot; Amelia said. &quot;So I asked Brian in security to look into it. At first they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong. She did her kitchen work, laundry work when needed, and made all of her patrols of the kennels precisely on time. When she had no other work she would clean a random room to kill time. But then Brian noticed something a little odd in the camera footage. Some of it seemed very repetitive. He went back through the archives and discovered that some of the footage had been edited, specifically the footage from the kennel during her midnight patrol. It seems she had gotten into the security office, downloaded footage of her doing her her patrol correctly for several nights in a row, and used it to patch over footage on days when she wasn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So she was neglecting her patrols then?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And also no. Brian showed me the edited footage a little under a week ago. He had also found the program that automatically spliced the footage in every night and removed it. Last night he gave me the unedited footage from the last several days and early this morning I confronted Mina. She confessed everything after I showed her the video. She was in the kennel during her patrol, but she wasn&#39;t patrolling. Instead she was stripping naked, locking herself in one of the cages, and pretending she was one of the dogs. Apparently she gets off on it. When Jen showed up she couldn&#39;t risk being caught by her, but she also couldn&#39;t resist the allure of her dream being fulfilled right before her eyes. She&#39;s been masturbating in front of Jen&#39;s cage every night for the past week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice stared at the girl writhing on the dog bed in the cage. Jen stared too. Mina obviously knew she had an audience, her ears were wide open even if her mouth was full she had opened her eyes and twisted until she could see Jen. Her face screamed &#39;LOOK AT ME!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did she end up like this?&quot; Alice asked hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave her an ultimatum. She had been neglecting her duties, violating her work contract. I was going to fire her but she begged me for a second chance. I jokingly said that she could join Jen in the kennel for the rest of the month and she agreed. I had Betty prep her while I had security search her locker. They brought me that vibrator and gag along with a bunch of other sex toys and pornography she had been stashing there. It really hurts that one of my most trusted employees would do this to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t be like that.&quot; Betty cut in, &quot;She was still a good employee, always got her job done and went above and beyond. So she was fooling around a bit on her shift, at least she was doing it in the right place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia gave Betty a cold look. Betty matched it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still no excuse.&quot; Amelia continued. &quot;This is her punishment which she chose herself. I will be overseeing her training alongside Jen. With any luck Jen might rub off on her and she&#39;ll gain a proper sense of obedience. After this if she still feels like joining the dogs in the kennel it will be on her own time, not mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned back to Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure Jen gets her lunch. I am cancelling the afternoon lessons so I can address the staff about this new development. If you would like to stay late to help cover Mina&#39;s shift I am willing to offer triple overtime from my own pocket.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can stay late, but I need to go home for a few hours this afternoon to take care of some personal business first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is perfectly fine. Feed Jen now and I&#39;ll have Betty watch the two of them while you are gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Ms. Lockehart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia turned smartly on her heel and strode out of the kennel. After she had left, Alice pulled Jen away from Mina&#39;s cage and into her own. Amelia must have called the kitchen because another carer showed up with the food cart moments later. She stared openly at Mina while Alice filled Jen&#39;s bowl from the cart.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s true then.&quot; The carer breathed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t believe the rumors.&quot; Betty responded flatly, &quot;Ms Lockehart will be making an announcement about what happened in an hour or so. Just wait and you will get to hear all the sordid details.&quot;<br />
<br />
The carer gave Betty a blank look and after Alice filled Jen&#39;s bowl the second time she wheeled cart back out of the kennel. Alice stuck around to make sure Jen finished her entire meal then handed responsibility over to Betty and left. She stood there, looking back and forth between the two girls and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just when I thought things couldn&#39;t get any weirder.&quot;</p>
