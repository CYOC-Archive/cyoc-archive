<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another fitful night of dreams awaited Ken, each just like before, a tiny body pinned beneath a cock bigger than he was. It was worse, because they were so blissful this time. While he should have been in the grip of terror, he found himself hungrily licking up at an erection larger than his own body. He was more cock than man in these dreams and it made him so, so happy. He awoke, covered in sweat and semen, the sheets and blankets sticking to his body.<br />
He kept his eyes shut, terrified of looking down at his body. The thing between his legs felt even heavier today, but there was something worse. He kicked and strained, reaching for the edge of the bed, and finding that he couldn&#39;t. He knew without even looking that he&#39;d gotten even smaller.<br />
When he climbed out of bed and his pants fell down around his ankles, he knew the truth, but something worse tickled at the back of his brain. His body felt lighter, leaner. He brought his hand in front of his face and found it seemingly delicate, far too thin to be his hand. He stole a nervous glance down at his chest and found it smooth utterly devoid of hair.<br />
Then there was something else, a weight on his backside that hadn&#39;t been there before. He clamped his hands to his ass and found it meatier...fuller, rounder. What was happening to him now? He went to rush to the bathroom to see what new horror awaited him, only to go flying forwards, unaccustomed to his new center of gravity. He tripped out of his pajama pants and went falling down, face-planted against the spongy head of his own penis.<br />
Face? Oh no that was too, too big. He stood and for the first time gauged his height against the rest of his room. He gulped, realizing that the top of his 3-foot tall dresser was at eye-level. Ken shook his head and scooped up his oversized girth and threw it over his shoulder, walking barefoot through his colossal bedroom like a child holding a pet dog.<br />
There was a floor-length mirror by his closet. He stopped in front of it and stared wide-eyed at the impossible sight before him. Could that figure in the mirror really be him? He didn&#39;t even look like himself. He had to step forwards and really get a look at his face to recognize any similarity into who he&#39;d been before.<br />
For starters, he could be barely over three feet tall. Two feet of height, gone in a single night. But not only that, all of his muscle mass had seemingly evaporated from his body, leaving him small and hairless, his features delicate and angular. He looked almost angelic, girly even, except for the massive cock dangling between his legs that&#39;d put even the largest man to shame.<br />
Another thing that seemed to not have shrunk at all was his ass. He craned his neck around his backside to get a good look at it in the mirror. It looked absolutely massive on his tiny petite frame, large and straining out a good eight inches off his body, which looked hilariously disproportionate. It was a miracle he could even walk at all.<br />
Ken couldn&#39;t explain why he did what he did next. It came about impulsively and without warning. He clamped a delicate little hand against his mammoth backside. The cheek jiggled and wobbled so much, he almost fell forwards. No sooner had he done so than a light, effeminate whimper crept out his mouth. His voice had changed too, but that was far from his only concern. Slapping his ass felt fucking good.<br />
Already he could see the python curled over his shoulder begin to stiffen and rise. Slowly, but surely it became harder to keep standing up right. He stumbled backwards and nearly fell back on his cushioney ass. There was no way he&#39;d be able to pleasure himself at this size. He&#39;d have to get creative.<br />
A part of his mind screamed in panic, the man he&#39;d been yesterday still holding sway over the oversexed BOY he was now. Oh god, he was a boy, a little twinky hypercocked boy with a giant ass, and he wanted to cum. The panicked man screaming at him, angry and horrified was a voice shrinking in the distance, a voice smaller than the giant cock beginning to rise and throb over his head.<br />
Ken looked around the room for a solution. He found one in the sheets and pillows that had fallen off his bed when he tumbled out of it. He waddled over to them, his ass cheeks jiggling with each and every step, till he allowed himself to tumble cock forwards into the smooth satin.<br />
A blissful smile moved over his face as he began thrusting his cock into the satin. It felt so good against his giant member, which had already begun leaking pre. At its full height, the massive cock now stood at least two feet tall, nearly two-thirds of his entire body. His little feet dangled off of his balls, the tips of his toes barely able to reach against the floor. He used both his hands to try and thrust himself against his cock, using the weight of his ass to push himself forwards<br />
&quot;Yeah! Yeah!&quot; he cried, his tiny little moans growing louder and louder. &quot;Fucking cum. Fucking SHRINK!&quot;<br />
The word exploded out of his mouth without his realization. For a moment he remembered himself, eyes growing wide with terror and shame. And then a tingling overtook his tiny body, and his toes lifted up off of the floor. His ass jiggled of its own accord and his cock pulsed, and his world exploded into bliss as he continued to shrink while he was awake. One long sustained shrink as the inches melted off his body, and cum spewed forth from a cock that was slowly becoming longer than he was tall. Three inches gone.<br />
&quot;YES! SHRINK!&quot; he screamed at last.<br />
Four inches. Gone. His ass was huge and bubbly and almost as big as he was now, while his cock had taken on mammoth proportions.<br />
&quot;Shrink! Shrink! Shriiiiink!&quot; He cried at last, feeling each inch leave him, until he collapsed against his own cock, barely a foot and a half tall. He lay there, panting and spent, covered in his own spunk.<br />
In the echoing distance, he heard a knocking at his door. He should probably answer it, he thought. Get cleaned up. Get some help. It was a silly thought. He could barely even walk. He passed out as the door creaked open, and a massive shadow appeared over him.</p>
