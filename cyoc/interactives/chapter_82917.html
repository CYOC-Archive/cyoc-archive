<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next couple of days the faces of Craig, Dustin and Scott slowly disappeared into Herman’s body. First skin grew over them, turning them into moving, but thankfully silent, bass reliefs. Then their features slowly smoothened over until they were gone entirely. Aside from Herman’s extra bulk not a trace remained of any of the absorbed boys’ existence. <br />
Herman could still feel their souls within him; they were trapped inside his body and they hated it. Herman couldn’t fault them for that, being stuck as sentient muscle mass didn’t sound very fun. That, however just made Herman enjoy having them inside him even more.  <br />
Less enjoyable was the amount media attention the mysterious disappearances of the three boys got. Three kids vanishing into thin air, in broad daylight and while being on school grounds was naturally a huge deal. The news wouldn’t shut up about them, the principal wouldn’t shut up about them, the teachers wouldn’t shut about them, the other kids wouldn’t shut up about them. Coach Peterson and even Herman’s parents wouldn’t shut up about them. It was annoying for one because Craig, Dustin and Scott either heard or sensed that they were searched for/talked about and the muscles they had been converted into started to squirm under his skin whenever that happened and that felt rather uncomfortable. But the whole thing also made Herman feel nervous; if Ty was found out, what would happen to Herman? Would they blame him for the disappearances? They couldn’t blame Dustin and Craig on him, he had never asked Ty to merge those two fuckers into him, he was as much a victim as them. And Scott, well, Herman hadn’t  known that Ty had given him the powers to absorb other people. They can’t blame me! Herman thought as he opened his locker in the hallway They can’t!<br />
“Good morning Mr. Weinberg, I hope you remembered to study for the test this afternoon.”<br />
Herman groaned as he closed his locker and turned to face Mr. Henning, the assistant teacher that taught his English class. That guy was the usual young English BE; tall, with bright blue eyes, a full head of longish, chestnut brown hair and always dressed to the nines, today in a sharp, navy blue pinstripe suit and pink shirt. He was one of those “passionate” teachers who really pretended to care about his subject and because he was young and a pretty boy, all the girls hung on every word he said and all the guys hated him. Herman had initially ignored it, until his own girlfriend, Gwen, had also started to fall for the little faggot. <br />
<br />
“Yes Mr. Henning,” he answered in annoyance. <br />
<br />
“Very good, Herman! You know at the moment many students use the disappearance of those three boys last week as an excuse not to study or do their homework. They say that they are too traumatised. Silly isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Fuck. Henning had to bring them up, didn’t he? <br />
“Yeah..” agreed Herman, clutching his side as what was once Craig started to squirm. <br />
<br />
Mr. Henning rose his eyebrows in amusement at that. “Are you alright Herman? You’re not upset about the whole thing too are you?” Suddenly the amusement turned into a knowing smirk, “After all, you know exactly where they are, don’t you?” <br />
<br />
“Excuse me sir?” <br />
<br />
There was a weird glint in Henning’s eye as he drew closer to Herman and lowered his voice. “Aw come on; I know very well what you did to them. I don’t know how you did it; perhaps you’re some sort of magician or mutant or whatever, but I know what I saw with mine own eyes, Herman. I watched you in the gym that day, when you sucked Scott Favela up your ass.” He cocked his eyebrow and looked over Herman top to toe “And it looks like the kid bulked you up quite nicely, if I may say so. Of course, all that bulk couldn’t come from scrawny little Scotty alone, could it? I bet everything I own that Craig and Dustin are alongside Favela, aren’t they Herman?” <br />
<br />
Argh! Dustin and Scott started revolting too, Herman went down to his knees from the agony. <br />
“You can prove nothing, Henning!” Shit! Herman was caught! And to make the whole thing worse he could feel Craig’s face pushing against his skin again. You are mine Craig! He thought to himself. You ain’t gonna get out of here!<br />
<br />
Henning knelt down to him. “It seems to me, if I just keep pressing the matter I won’t have to worry about proving anything. But don’t worry I’m not here to expose you or to take those boys away from you, if that’s even possible.”<br />
Herman was confused, “Then why are you bothering me?” <br />
“Curiosity,” explained Henning and nodded towards a door, “Come, Mr. Flynn is out on a field trip with his class, let’s use his room and talk in private.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Herman followed Henning into the empty class room and explained to him everything that happened since his run in with Ty. <br />
<br />
“...and I actually thought I they had dissolved, but it seems they still have their faces.” <br />
Herman concluded his explanation about how Craig, Dustin and Scott had become part of him by lifting his shirt, exposing the part of his stomach were the outline of Craig’s face struggled in vain to break through his skin, screaming silently. Herman’s skin was stretched so tightly over Craig’s face that one could make out his features perfectly, even the outlines of individual teeth were visible. <br />
<br />
Henning knelt beside him, watching  Craig’s struggle with a goofy grin on his face. Herman had expected people to be revolted by this whole mess, Mr. Henning’s reaction creeped him out.<br />
“Unbelievable, that really is Craig McFadden. I still haven’t graded his last paper.”<br />
<br />
“He won’t be needing it anymore,” grumbled Herman and pushed Craig’s face back into his body. “Can I go now, Sir?” <br />
Mr. Henning stood up and bit his lip, “Not quite, Herman. There’s one thing I’d like to request of you.” He looked straight at Herman.<br />
<br />
“I want you to absorb me. I want to be part of you like McFadden and the other two.”<br />
Herman stared at Mr. Henning for a while.“So what do you say?” <br />
<br />
“What?” Herman shook his head “Why?” He really didn’t understand what kind of person wants to be converted into somebody else’s body mass?<br />
 <br />
Henning smiled, “Why I want to be part of you?” He snorted and shrugged his shoulders, “I have no idea? What could a successful man like me drive to wish to spend the rest of his life trapped inside a dumb jock like you? I guess...well I guess I always had this weird thing. It excites me to get dominated by somebody else and what you did to Scott, what you continue to do to all three of those boys....It’s the ultimate form of dominance; you deny them the very right to be themselves. I want that, Herman!” <br />
Herman shuddered, that guy got off of this! He shook his head.<br />
<br />
“I’m outta here! See ya, you sicko!” he started to leave, but Henning gripped his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Herman, please understand this; either you make me a part of you, or I expose your little secret to the world.” <br />
<br />
Herman turned around and glared at Henning. “Fine.” He put off his black leather jacket and put it on the teacher’s desk and then started pulling off his shirt. <br />
<br />
The goofy grin had returned to Henning’s face, “Should I get undressed too?” <br />
<br />
“Won’t be necessary,” explained Herman as he cracked his knuckles and neck to loosen his muscles, “the three others were dressed too when they became part of me. Your fancy little suit will dissolve into my flesh along with the rest of ya.” This was going to be so weird, but at least Henning would be less of a pain in the ass once he was absorbed. <br />
Herman, now wearing nothing but his jeans, built himself up in front of Henning and beckoned him to come closer, “Well, c’mere!” <br />
<br />
Henning nodded and stepped closer to Herman, admiring the football player’s chisel chest.  “How do we start?” <br />
<br />
“Like this!” Herman grabbed Henning’s head with both hands and jammed the other man’s face in-between his pecks. As Scott had been absorbed through his ass, Herman had not seen much of the process so he was looking forward to see it up-close this time around. Because he wanted to merge with Herman, Henning was much calmer than Scott, but still, natural flexes caused the college graduate to struggle against having his face smushed into Herman’s chest. It took a few moments for Herman to subjugate Henning, but once that was accomplished the same sense of power and strength like he had experienced while absorbing Scott flushed over Herman, along with that faint, but pleasant buzz in his head.  He could also feel Henning gripping him by the sides, the college graduate’s nails borrowing into his skin. <br />
<br />
Herman looked down to his chest and was treated to the awesome sight of his own pectorals liquefying and Mr. Henning’s head, blue eyes and luxurious hair all, sinking into it. At first Henning’s body tensed, but then it completely relaxed, even his hands glided from Herman’s side as his arms stupidly dangled to his sides. The absorption process continues momentarily as Henning’s body, inch for inch was sucked into Herman’s pecks, his pinstripe suited legs getting losing ground as his shoulders and chest were absorbed in one gulp-like motion. <br />
<br />
 Herman smiled as he massaged his arms, the muscles swelling with an influx of mass converted from Henning’s body. The guy might have been a sicko and a douche, but he did make a decent bit of bulk. <br />
By now all that was left of Henning was his feet, now one sticking out of each of Herman’s bulging pectorals. Herman grimaced as he saw the black shoes on them. Absorbing clothes was one thing, but shoes and socks.... Herman shuddered and removed the shoes and socks off Henning’s feet. He glanced at the clock, he was almost late for first period! <br />
<br />
“Okay, Sir, time to wrap this up,” he declared, grabbed Henning’s feet and pushed them into his pecks. He lifted his hands and all that remained was smooth, bronze colored skin. Henning was gone. <br />
Herman smirked.“Welcome to the team, Mr. Henning!” <br />
<br />
“Why, thanks Herman,” said Mr. Henning gleefully, “but you can call me Vincent now, after all you and me are one now.” <br />
<br />
Herman was startled as he looked down at his chest and saw Mr. Henning’s face nestled between his pecks. He groaned “Oh, no this again!” he started to fiddle with the clothes on the desk. <br />
Mr. Henning’s face grinned, “This is fascinating! I can’t believe I’m part of someone else’s body! Don’t worry Herman, I won’t be any bother to y...” <br />
<br />
“You bet you won’t, you little douchebag!” snapped Herman as he shoved a sock into Henning’s mouth, silencing him. Then he put on his t-shirt and zipped up his jacket, hiding the bump in his chest that was Mr. Henning’s face and left the classroom to get to first period.</p>
