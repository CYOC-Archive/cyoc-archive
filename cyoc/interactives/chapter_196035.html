<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What to do next?&quot; he thought while admiring his new, improved form in the mirror. Dustin was taken care of, at least for a little while. So how about June? Maybe Mark? It was a hard decision, since they all deserved a little revenge for the way they treated him...<br />
<br />
&quot;I think June is up for a little fun&quot; he decided, heading for the kitchen, where his foster mother was in the process of kissing Mark goodbye. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you tonight&quot; she winked. From around the corner Ty gagged silently. With their goodbyes out of the way June returned to the kitchen table to read the paper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Typical&quot; Ty sighed, if she wasn&#39;t bitching at him she was bitching at the world. As he watched from the darkened hallway, Ty saw Sam, Dustin&#39;s golden retriever, amble into the kitchen, giving him a wonderful idea. &quot;I wish that Sam was extremely attracted to June, and the more she denies his advances the more of a real &#39;bitch&#39; she&#39;ll become.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly Sam seemed to fixate on June. He walked over and placed his nose between her legs beneath the table. &quot;Sam! What&#39;s gotten into you boy?&quot; she laughed, pushing the dog away. &quot;Go on, shoo! Mommy&#39;s reading the newspaper!&quot; With a huff Sam slunk away, curling up on the rug in front of the sink, his gaze still trained on June.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly dog&quot; she laughed, shaking her head. A sudden wave of dizziness hit her, and she raised a hand to her head. As the wave receded, she realized how odd it felt to be sitting at the table... folding the paper, she headed to the living room and sat in the armchair, yet that too felt wrong for some reason. &quot;Just can&#39;t seem to get comfortable today...&quot; June slid to the floor and sighed in relief, flipping the newspaper back open. <br />
<br />
As if he knew she was more accessible, Sam came barreling into the living room. He jammed his nose between her legs again, this time rubbing her just right for she let out a soft cry of pleasure followed quickly by a shriek of shock. &quot;Sam! Bad dog! Go outside, you bad do...&quot; she trailed off, her nose tilting up as she scented something strange, like a musky cologne, but slightly sweet and ... tangy? &quot;What IS that smell?&quot; she murmured. So absorbed with the new, amazing scent in the room, June did not notice as her nose and jaw pushed outward, the tip slowly darkening as it searched for the source of the enticing smell. Setting aside the paper, she rose to her hands and knees and tried to triangulate where the scent was coming from, and within moments her newly sensitive nose had narrowed it down to the retriever sitting before her. June&#39;s eyes lifted and met Sam&#39;s insistent gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam... why...? I feel so... strange...&quot; she tried to hold herself back but her mind seemed to drift away as an animal instinct took over. Her now much longer tongue flicked out, lapping at Sam&#39;s muzzle and wriggling to get inside... and just as suddenly reality came back to her. &quot;What am I doing!&quot; she spit out a few golden hairs. &quot;Did I just lick...&quot; she suddenly felt an insistent itching sensation at the base of her spine. As she reached back to scratch, she realized she could feel something protruding down there... it felt like... a slender tail?! Twisting, she could just see something protruding from her lower back, about five inches in length and covered lightly in long, golden fur. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; June jumped up and raced to the downstairs bathroom. As she reached the mirror and caught a glance of her face, she let out an inhuman YELP!<br />
<br />
Unnoticed, Ty looked on as his foster mom transformed. Her tail had continued growing, now a whopping 2 feet long and covered in thick golden fur. Her face was a mix between dog and human, and her body had started to become lightly patched with golden fur. Her feet had started to change as well, while her hands still retained much of their original shape. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening to me?&quot; she repeated, watching her reflection while turning her head this way and that in horror. From outside the bathroom June heard a sharp bark. Sam was outside the door rolled over, his canine penis fully extended from it&#39;s sheath. &quot;You! You did this to me! ...but, how?&quot; June started to cry and fell to her knees. Sam took this as an invitation and rolled quickly to his feet, circling behind her to sniff and lap at her crotch again. She twisted awkwardly, trying to push him away, but her legs continued to change. &quot;No! I don&#39;t want to be a dog! I don&#39;t to have sex with Sam, please I... I&quot; her mouth pushed out farther, teeth growing and sharpening as her tongue changed fully, making it impossible to form human speech. Her hips cracked and legs shortened to fit her increasingly canine body. Her shorts slid down her thinner legs and puddled on the floor, revealing a lower half that matched Sam&#39;s almost perfectly.<br />
<br />
June looked back at herself and howled in disgust &quot;NOOOARRROOOOW!&quot; collapsing her forearms to the ground and burying her face in the carpet. Sam wasted no time in taking advantage of her new position, mounting her from behind and using his fore-paws to grip her torso. She wriggled frantically, but she was unable to shake the dog loose - she could feel his slick member pushing at her entrance! Looking down for something to help her pry the family dog off of her, she temporarily froze as she watched her hands transform, the digits shortening as her fingernails narrowed and pushed out into blunt claws. June whimpered as the transformation continued, renewing her struggle to get away from Sam. Succeeding in escaping his clutches, she scurried on all fours away from him, scrambling for the kitchen and hopefully the back door. Everything seemed huge around her, and she realized through her terror that she must have shrunk as well! Her nails clicked and scratched at the cool linoleum as she reached the kitchen and slid to a stop against the heavy door to the back yard - for some reason she couldn&#39;t really imagine how to make the door open; her mind was filled with a sort of fogginess when she tried to figure out the mechanics.<br />
<br />
Sam appeared in the opening to the living room, his hips still pumping slightly as his gaze locked on her once more. June whined. The only thing she could think of was that he was somehow the cause of her transformation, but the further she got... the more drawn to him she felt. Her nose twitched and her tongue lolled out as she caught his enticing scent again. She lifted one paw to scratch at the door as the final instinct to flee rose and popped like a bubble, leaving her mind blank and overwhelmed with canine instincts - the urge to mate quickly swamping her system and filling her with lust.<br />
<br />
She was a female dog through an through now, a true bitch.<br />
<br />
Ty backed away and headed for the stairs, wondering if he&#39;d gone too far. &quot;I have to change her back, but... I think I&#39;ll wait till they&#39;re done.&quot; He laughed, thinking about her shock and horror if he turned her back mid-act.<br />
<br />
As he rounded the corner he collided with Dustin, but was saved from falling over as his foster brother&#39;s smaller, altered form bounced back.<br />
<br />
Dustin regained his footing quickly, fueled by confusion and rage. He put his hands on his shrunken hips and snarled at Ty: &quot;Okay asshole, what did you do, put estrogen into my breakfast or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Estrogen couldn&#39;t do that much in one day, stupid&quot; Ty smiled somewhat evilly. &quot;But I did have something to do with it...&quot; he laughed seeing Dustin light up like a neon sign. <br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it! Wait till I tell mom! You&#39;ll be out on your ass!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down stupid, I can fix it, if I want to... Plus, I don&#39;t think you want to bug your mommy right now, she&#39;s not exactly &#39;herself&#39; at the moment.&quot; Ty walked passed Dustin with a grin on his face, heading up the stairs and back to his bedroom. This day was shaping up to be freaking incredible!</p>
