<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You shook your head and looked again. Your body was that of a little girl. Reaching down you felt between your legs to confirm this and sure enough you had a girl's pussy. You slipped a finger inside to see just how much there was. As far as you could tell it seemed to be complete. You looked up to see Dr. Morgana looking at you with a smile on her face. You blushed and took your finger out and covered your pussy with your hands. Dr. Morgana shook her head smiling. Soon the water was drained and you were let out. &quot;Why am I a little girl?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it was decided that since the first ones may not like us checking up on them using the communication aspect of the nanites that the next best way would be for one of us to take care of you,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;I was the lucky one chosen to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about my family?&quot; you asked. You couldn't just leave them. Ok so you still lived at home with your parents but your dad was legally disabled so you were there to help out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've already contacted them,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;We told them that you had been selected by the government to be part of a secret project.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll think that I've been kidnapped,&quot; you said. &quot;What happens when they ask around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they think that you told them,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;We synthesized your voice. Besides you are part of a secret project now. And you will be able to see them again. Your original DNA is stored in the nanites. Though for awhile we don't want you using it. besides there's a special code word you need to say to activate it. Now I'm sure you're wondering what your new name is. Your name is now Rachael Jo Morgana. This is who you are now. And it looks like your sister is about done transforming herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at the girl in the tank and thought that she did look younger from when you last saw her. A green light flashed on the side and Dr. Morgana started draining the water from her cylinder. &quot;Why did you transform me into a girl but leave her as a girl?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you answered that you would like to be transformed into a little girl if you could,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;Susan meanwhile said she didn't want to be transformed into a little boy. We wanted to have four people in the first round. Two male and two female. One of the males would be transformed into a little girl while the other was transformed into a little boy. One of the females would be transformed into a little boy while the other was transformed into a little girl. It's my luck that I ended up with the two little girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I can't be a girl,&quot; you said in shock. &quot;I don't know the first thing about being one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you answer the questions on the forms truthfully?&quot; Dr. Morgana asked looking worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; you said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you should be able to adjust,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;It's part of the reason that we picked you. I realize that this is a bit of a shock to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I said I was willing to be a little girl,&quot; you said. &quot;But to be honest I didn't really think that I would become one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;We should have put that question on there. Well we'll just have to add it.&quot; She shook her head and said, &quot;And to think we had thought that we had thought of everything. Probably the most important question and we missed it. I'm sorry that I surprised you with this transformation but we thought you were the perfect candidate for this. I think you still are though if I had known that you really didn't think you would be transformed into a little girl I would have told you. Though you do seem to be handling it well.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed and said, &quot;Thanks. Uh... can I get some clothes here Dr. Morgana?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a moment,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;And please call me Mom or Mommy as that's what I am to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I can do that,&quot; you said as Dr. Morgana opened Susan's cylinder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's understandable but I would prefer it if you did,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. She turned to Susan and said with a smile, &quot;Hello Susan Marie Morgana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Sally,&quot; Susan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not now,&quot; Dr. Morgana said then launched into an explanation of what she told you. &quot;So you're my daughter now,&quot; she finished up. &quot;Just as Rachael is. I guess you two want to know how old you are.&quot; When you both nodded she continued, &quot;You're both eight. You're fraternal twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at Susan and saw that she had sandy brown hair and green eyes. You on the other hand looked in a mirror and saw that you had dirty blond hair and blue eyes. You had slightly smaller ears than Susan and your eyes were set a little closer together than hers. &quot;How about some clothes now Dr. Morgana?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm your mother not Dr. Morgana,&quot; Dr. Morgana scolded you. &quot;As to clothes you can direct the nanites to create them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Susan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just will the clothing inventory to appear in front of your eyes,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;Well it really won't appear there but it will seem like it to you. Then all you have to do is scroll through the clothes and for each piece you want to wear just say &quot;Clothes appear&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
You seemed to have no problem with bringing the selection up. There was a limited selection though and you asked, &quot;How do we get more clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when you put new clothes on the nanites can integrate them into the system,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;To do that you'd have to say &quot;Clothes integrate&quot; and the nanites will do the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and continued to scroll through the clothes. Finally you settled on a pair of plain yellow panties. You said, &quot;Clothes appear,&quot; and watched what happened. The skin that would be covered by the panties began to tingle. You saw the panties fade into view. You were amazed by it and when your skin stopped tingling you pulled the waist band of your panties out. They were real. You felt the smooth cotton fabric of them where they touched your skin. &quot;Wow,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty neat huh,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;What you're holding are the nanites that reside in your body now. When you pick the clothes they migrate to the surface of your skin to form what you pick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it feels like cotton not metal,&quot; Susan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because the nanites have arranged themselves to feel like cotton,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;They can arrange themselves to be silk, satin, metal, plastic, grass, or any other form of material. If you put those panties beside another pair you wouldn't be able to tell which ones were comprised of the nanites and which ones were the natural fibers. Now finish getting dressed girls then I'll take you home and we can have dinner. I'll also tell you how to communicate with each other without saying anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got you excited so you quickly chose socks, a yellow shirt, a pair of pants with yellow flowers on it, and a pair of shoes. Susan had chosen a pink dress and sandals. Now clothed Dr. Morgana took you to your new home.</p>
