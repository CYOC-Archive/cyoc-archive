<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fido and Ellie seemed to run through the neighborhood for ages, before an overpowering scent seemed to hit them. The two of them stopped by the park and sniffed the air. Ellie had no idea where this smell was coming from, but Fido had a strange feeling that he recognized it from before. Before long, they heard a rustling in the bushes. <br />
<br />
“What was that?” Freddy thought to himself, nervously, as he looked in its direction.<br />
<br />
After a moment passed, Fido and Ellie could see the stray black labrador bitch from last week emerge from the bush and cautiously trot over to approach them. The dog’s face had a mix of confusion and anger across it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God no&quot; Freddy thought to himself, as the stray bitch got up close to Fido&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The dogs began to bark at each other, as the stray bitch demanded to know why Fido had run off from her last week and who Ellie was. Ellie defended Fido, saying that he was her boyfriend, which Fido outright denied. The barking grew more intense, as they argued about Fido and the fact that the two two female dogs were now both pregnant with his puppies. Both grew increasingly angry at Fido for being a player and demanded to know how many other female dogs he had slept with before them. Fido denied sleeping with anyone else, even though he had fucked Michael just yesterday. They didn&#39;t need to know this, in Freddy&#39;s estimation. The barking between the dogs became so loud that a nearby neighbor opened their door and proceeded to yell at the dogs to shoo and go away. <br />
<br />
In a panic, the three dogs made their way to the bush where the stray bitch had come from and hid in there to continue their confrontation. Finally, after the two female dogs had calmed down a bit, Fido told them of who he really was and what he needed to do. The two female dogs listened closely, as Fido barked in defense of Michael, who he referred to as his master, and his desire to rescue his friends. The dogs were hesitant when Fido finally asked them to help him find Michael and Sofya. They had no idea who they were, although Ellie had an inkling of who Michael might be, where to look for them and no clue as to what their scent was like. The stray bitch thought that Fido should stay in the park with her, while Ellie thought that she and Fido should be getting back home now.<br />
<br />
Fido resisted their temptations to change course and continued to insist they needed to find Michael and Sofya. He warned them that they were in danger and it was his responsibility and obligation to rescue them. He barked about a location on the outskirts of town where an old, abandoned house was. He barked that maybe this was where they were being held. Ellie had no idea where this house was, while the stay bitch knew of its location, but advised against going there. Someone had died in that house, the stray bitch insisted, based on the smell of a rotting corpse that laid somewhere in the house. Fido insisted that the wizard may have been responsible for killing that person and they should check it out. <br />
<br />
Ellie was resistant to the idea, the stray was even more so. Both had their objections. It was too dangerous. Ellie wanted to go home to her master, even though he was mad at her. The stray bitch thought there was more danger in the house than she was prepared to face. Fido tried to reassure them that he just needed their help in finding his friends and that he’d go rescue them on his own. The two female dogs thought to themselves for a moment. Fido stared at them, unsure of what they’d decide. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they both reluctantly barked in agreement that they would help him find his friends. Fido barked happily in response, knowing that three heads, or rather, three dogs, were better than one.<br />
<br />
After Fido celebrated his ability to convince the two female dogs to help him, he came upon a new problem.<br />
<br />
“Where is that house in relation to here?” Freddy thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Fido laid down in the dirt, as the stray bitch and Ellie watched him warily, puzzled by his actions. Freddy remembered where the house when he was a human, but his memories weren’t so strong as a dog. He’d have to trace his steps from where they were in the park. The only way he suspected he could get to the old house was through the center of town. That was a risky gamble because lots of people would be out there this afternoon and they could be spotted and caught by the dog catcher. Bill had probably called the pound, so there&#39;d be eyes looking out for them. <br />
<br />
Ellie barked at Fido, asking what he was thinking about. Fido barked back that he was trying to figure out how to get to the house. The stray bitch barked that she knew how to get to the house from where they were, but they’d have to be careful, as lots of humans perused the path they needed to take. Wanting to leave as soon as possible, Fido barked to the stray bitch to lead the way and she did so.<br />
<br />
When Fido got up from the ground, the dogs sprinted out of the bush and began to run towards the center of town. Once they arrived in the more crowded part of town, Fido started to get increasingly nervous. The sights, sounds and smells were beginning to overwhelm his enhanced senses. The other two dogs seemed unfazed by this, as if they were already used to it. Fido hadn&#39;t lived his entire life as a dog, so it was becoming increasingly difficult to deal with all of these attacks on his overpowered senses. He was getting increasingly nervous, as he began to have trouble following the lead of the stray bitch. At a certain point, the stray bitch turned to Fido, as if to indicate that he needed to keep up with her. Fido nodded, which the stray bitch didn’t understand, but turned back to continue moving. <br />
<br />
As the three dogs made their way through the center of town, Fido passed by the coffee shop that he and Michael usually frequented on the weekends.<br />
<br />
“It’ll be nice for things to get back to normal so I can go back there again” Freddy thought to himself, as Fido briefly stopped to look in the window of the crowded shop.<br />
<br />
After a short moment, Fido continued to trot to keep up with the other two dogs. As they turned a corner. Fido spotted the magic shop where he originally took possession of the ring and stopped for a moment to look inside. <br />
<br />
“I wonder if the old man is in today” Freddy thought to himself, as he peered in the store&#39;s window. <br />
<br />
As he tried to enter the shop, the stray bitch barked at him loudly, as if to indicate that they needed to keep going. Fido barked back at her that the old man in the magic shop could help them find his friends, but the stray bitch barked that there was no magic shop and that they needed to keep moving. <br />
<br />
“So Diya’s theory was correct” Freddy thought to himself, as Fido turned away from the magic shop and quickly ran to catch up with the other two female dogs. “The shop is only visible to those who are meant to see it. I can’t wait to tell Michael about this. That is, if I can ever find him.”<br />
<br />
Fido continued to make his way through town with the other two dogs, as pedestrians began to spot them and freaked out at their presence. <br />
<br />
“Oh my lord” one woman said, as she clutched her pearls when the dogs passed her by. <br />
<br />
“Who let those strays on the loose?” another woman asked her friend, when she spotted them. “Don’t we have pest control around here?”<br />
<br />
A commotion began to build, as civilians freaked out over seeing the strays roaming the streets of their town unattended. Freaking out, Fido began to make a dash for a less crowded part of town, as the two bitches followed closely behind him. The stray bitch barked at Fido to be careful, as he was going the wrong way. Despite her barks of warning, Fldo was not listening to her. Before they could stop arguing, however, a loud voice could be heard addressing them.<br />
<br />
“There you are!” the man said to them. <br />
<br />
The three dogs turned up to see a man who was the town’s dog catcher. He wore beige pants and a beige shirt, sort of like a UPS driver. A hat he wore atop his head was embroiled with the words &quot;dog catcher&quot; on it.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Freddy thought to himself, as he stared up at the dog catcher nervously. “This can’t be good.”<br />
<br />
“You three are coming with me” the dog catcher said, as he made his way towards them. <br />
<br />
In a panic, the three dogs began to bolt away as fast as they could, as they continued to quickly run through town. The dog catcher got in his vehicle that was parked nearby and proceeded to drive in their direction. Despite their ability to evade humans on foot, they were powerless to outrun the dog catcher’s van. Thinking they could evade him somehow, the three dogs turned a corner, but learned too late that it was not a good decision.<br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself, as he looked up the alleyway in a panic. “It’s a dead end.”<br />
<br />
The dog catcher’s van drove up and blocked the entrance of the alleyway. Getting out of his vehicle, the dog catcher had a prod and another hidden device. The three dogs loudly barked at him, as he slowly made his way towards them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay away!&quot; Freddy barked as Fido.<br />
<br />
“Alright doggies” the dog catcher said to them, menacingly. “You want to do this the easy way or the hard way.”<br />
<br />
The stray bitch barked loudly, as she proceeded to lunge at him. Before she could land her teeth on his skin, the dog catcher blew a dart which landed on her neck. In shock, the dog fell back to the ground and proceeded to fall into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Freddy thought to himself, as he looked up at the dog catcher, with darts in his hand. <br />
<br />
In fear, Fido and Ellie began to sprint to the other end of the alleyway, hoping to find some sort of way to climb up the wall and escape. As they attempted to flee the dog catcher, two puffing noises could be heard, as tranquilizer darts landed on Fido and Ellie’s butts. Freaking out, the two dogs were forced to fall down to the ground and they both began to feel sleepy.<br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself, as Fido began to doze off. “This is it. I’m in big trouble now.”<br />
<br />
The last thing Fido could see before he blacked out was the dog catcher taking a net and placing it over his neck. <br />
<br />
When Fido woke up, he was…..</p>
