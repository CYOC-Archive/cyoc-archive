<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought this through and wondered if he wants to randomly turn into an animal.  This might give him a real good experience and it would be fun being an animal doing whatever they want.  So he decided to let it happen.  Of course, he had to make a few modifications before he could start changing.<br />
<br />
The first thing he chooses is the random option on the animal category.  In the location option, he decided to random as well.  As he was done with that, he spotted two more options that he didn’t see coming.  One was if he wanted the change to be mental.  Thinking about that, he decided to change his mind to match his body.  That way he won’t feel completely uncomfortable with his animal form.  The second option is the duration of the change.  As in, how long will he stay in his animal form?  From what he was looking at, the range is somewhere between one day to completely random as well.  Looking at this, he has to decided on his options.  If he goes random, there’s no telling when the animal inside and outside him would end.  The last thing he wants is to make the changes permanent.  So looking through his options, he decided to end the change manually.  His best option is for the change to last a full year.  That way he can experience the whole thing without worry about when it will end.  Review all of his choice, he nodded in approval and smiled deeply.  Moving the mouse cursor to the start button, he clicked it and the page changed to a message that says…<br />
<br />
‘Warning: A random mental change with a time limit of one year could lead to some serious consequences.  Any type of implementations that might occur (Such as sex, death, or an unexpected event) would lead to the change is permanent.  Do you which to accept these options.’  Below it was the choice between the yes and no buttons.  He finds that quite unique since anyone who had this program would have second thoughts on the changes.  But not Jeff…  Jeff will take the risk to try out this random animal package.  So feeling confident with himself, he took a deep breath and clicked on the yes button.  Almost immediately, the screen changed and said, ‘Transformation in progress.’  The moment that happened, Jeff could feel the tingling all over his body.  That means that the changes have started.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happens is that his seems to be growing only a few inches.  So his guess is that he was gaining some height and growing big.  So he got off of his chair and looked at himself to see his clothes feeling a little tighter.  But just as he was gaining height, he was also growing some muscles as well.  He could feel his clothes straining as his muscles bulged on his arms and legs.  Feeling ecstatic, he hurried to the mirror next to his bed to get a good look at himself.  Turns out, he was starting to become quite a hunk.  He could feel his chest expanding with pectoral muscles, and his arms and legs looked very muscular.  His height even grew substantially as he was above the six-foot mark.  In fact, his shirt started to ride up at the bottom to reveal his six-pack abs that just appeared.  Jeff couldn’t believe this as he started to flew some muscles while at the same time his clothes started to rip apart at the seems.  He doesn’t know what animal he was becoming, but at least he knows that it was something both big and strong.<br />
<br />
As he was checking himself out at the mirror, something strange happened all around him.  Though he doesn’t know it yet, but his old plant that he rarely takes care of is starting to become healthy as the green foliage was returning to its leaves.  But just as it was getting healthy, it also started to grow bigger, almost reaching the ceiling.  But it’s not his plant that was changing, it was everything else.  All around his room, his furniture was slowly yet surely changing while the walls were peeling paint and slowly eroding.  The chair he sat on was sprouting twigs while leaves emanated out of it, his bed looked like it was imploding in the middle as the sheets turned green, and his television was shapshifting while getting hard.  Yet Jeff didn’t even know this yet as he was checking himself out in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He continued to grow more and more, reaching the seven-foot mark as his body gaining more and more muscles by the second.  He started to strike some manly poses and was feeling completely comfortable even though his clothes are on the verge of snapping.  “Wow!  This is super cool!” he said with his voice sounding much lower and a little rougher at the same time.  “I wonder what type of animal I’m turning into that has this body?”  The moment he said that his shirt tore apart in one rip revealing his manly chest and abs.   At the same time, his shoes and socks couldn’t take the as they blow open, exposing his feet.  And the legging of his pants ripped apart leaving him with nothing but incredibly tight ripped shorts.  He could even feel his button popped off and his zipper unzipping itself to show of his incredibly tight boxers.  The really strangest part is that the little body hair he has thinned and sucked into his skin, leaving his chest, arms and legs incredibly bare.  But Jeff didn’t mind that, as he was bigger and muscular by the second, already hitting the eight footer.<br />
<br />
As the changes continued, he started to feel a little aroused.  Looking down at himself, he noticed his groin was stirring and tenting up through his boxers.  He figured that the transformation is causing him to turn himself on.  Yet for some strange reason, he really wanted to masturbate while changing.  Eager to do this, he ripped off the remaining fabric off of him and was completely naked.  He then saw his penis fully erect and ready to deliver.  But as he was looking at that, he also noticed that all of his pubic hair was uncurling and sinking into his skin.  Feeling it around his skin, he could tell that it was getting less bushy by the second.  But Jeff didn’t care anymore; all he wants to do is release his member from agony.  So feeling completely confident, he placed his hand on his dick and started to pump at it hard.  He closed his eyes and moaned in pleasure as he tried his best to reach orgasm.  But as he was doing that, the changes progressed further as he goes up to eight feet.  But then, other changes took place that he didn’t expect.<br />
<br />
The first one is that there was a lump that was growing down his back as his spine started to lengthen.  The limp started to grow and went down his butt.  At the same time, the nails on his toes and fingers started to lengthen and were pointing, becoming sharper in moments.  Yet Jeff didn’t feel any pain what so ever.  All he could feel is extreme pleasure as he was forcing himself to pump harder.  As he was moaning, his voice grew deeper and rougher, sounding a little animalistic.  His teeth then grew long and sharp too, making them looks a little more carnivorous then normal.  Then the hair on his head was shrinking, looking less and less like he had hair to begin with.<br />
<br />
As the real changes started with him, his room continued to morph into the type of environment for his animal.  The paint on the wall was peeling more and more as the surface itself was degrading, revealing holed through the world around him.  The windows glass started to shatter as the wood started rotting away.  The floor was getting shaggier as the color when from dark brown to green.  The furniture all around him was looking less like furniture to begin with.  Ben bedspread sprouted bushed and was covering the entire bed while the wood in between grew out and formed branches themselves.  His chair was also growing at the twigs spread out and turned into branches of their own while more leaves sprout out of them.  His television then bloated up and hardens around the edges, fading away from existence and looking like a huge boulder.  The computer and desk was changing as well.  His desk expanded and grew jagged as the computer joined in and merged at the bottom.  The computer screen itself that was running the Chronovac program short-circuited for the moment and water was seeping out of the edges.  All around him, the things he didn’t need, like books, DVDs, teenage toys, CDs and clothes strewn about, started to decay and fade away to nothing.  Now his mirror he was looking at was the next to go, as the wood grew round while the glass started to crack bit by bit.  Still, Jeff didn’t expect anything as the transformation continued while he was trying desperately to release himself.<br />
<br />
As he was making out, his height has officially reached the tenth mark and he was growing bigger and bigger by the second.  He stopped gaining muscles, but that didn’t stop the other changes taking place.  His nub grew longer and longer and muscle mass slowly appeared around it.  Almost instantly, it began to twitch and move on its own accord.  That means that it had formed into a tail.  His feet were starting to change more then ever.  First his two front toes slowly drew closer together.  Then the two toes merged with each other until they formed into one, making his feet look like they have four toes.  The front three toes started to grow further apart from each other and extending.  His smallest toe migrated further to the back as his heel was slowly starting to lift itself up.  It was highly evident that his feet were looking less human and more animalistic.  All the while, his skin tone was loosing its peach color while scales were slowly forming around the bridges of his newly formed feet.  The body started to change as the bones inside began to alter.  His rib cage was expanding, his bones grew harder, and his spine lengthened further.  His face then started to look disfigured as his nose grew and pushed forward.  He then started to growl and moan more carnivorous then ever as his teeth grew extremely sharper then ever.  And the hair on his head shrank further until it was nothing more then a buzz cut.<br />
<br />
As he was growing past ten feet, Jeff’s head was close to the ceiling and was on the verge of hitting it.  But then, the ceiling opened up and faded away, leaving his height to extend upward until it stopped.  But it’s not the ceiling that changed; it was the rest of the room.  The walls around him was decaying at a world beyond his was being revealed.  His bed was long gone and in its place was a bush with branches sticking out of its sides.  The floor then changes textures from hard to completely soft as grass blades grew out of it.  His former television grew big and jagged, forming into a huge boulder.  His plant grew so much that the pot that it was in burst open to reveal its roots.  It then sank into the new floor and soaked up its rich nutrients.  The computer screen was then shut off and exploded, letting crystal clear water to come out of it and pouring down rocks that was use to be his desk and bottom half of his computer.  His chair then grew bigger as roots dug into the ground and new branches appeared, forming into a small tree.  The mirror then grew bigger as more cracks seeped through the glass.  Almost immediately, the glass exploded and shattered all over the floor.  At the same time, the wood where the mirror once was rounded as broken branches appeared at the side.  It was looking like more like a log then a mirror.  Jeff couldn’t see any of it, as he was busy pleasuring himself.<br />
<br />
His height and size already past the eleven-foot mark and he continues to grow and grow by the second.  With his size came his body as he was starting to become less and less human.  His tail continued to grow bigger and it was waving back and forth forcefully.  His feet stretched and grew long, making them too big for anything.  His legs then compressed and bend slightly, making it look distinguishable and easy to walk.  All the while, his body alters as his bones cracked, taking shape and forcing him to bend to the front.  But it didn’t matter to him since this new form makes it easier for him to pump his member.  But he was stroking it; he felt something a little off.  For one, his arms were a little shorter and it was getting harder to reach the full climax.  What he didn’t realize is that his arms were shrinking as they were slowly loosing their muscle mass.  But he can still hold on to his dick as he kept on stroking it with all of his might.  His skin was getting a yellowish green complexion as his texture went from soft to rough with scales covering more of his body.  His face continued to push forward, forcing his eyes to draw apart from each other.  His lips were slowly thinning, slowly showing his razor sharp teeth, while his ears grew smaller and non-existent.  What’s left of his hair on his head sank into his scaly skin, as he had nothing but a baldhead.  Even his pubic hair around his penis sank up and disappeared completely.  He was completely hairless.<br />
<br />
What’s left of the room has completely altered.  The remaining walls crumpled away and there was nothing left as the world opened around Jeff.  His floor is nothing more then a bed of wet grass.  All of his remaining furniture was replaced with nature as well.  His bed was a huge bush with sticks in between.  His television, nothing more then a huge boulder.  The mirror became a huge broken log.  His chair grew and turned into a tree that’s eight feet tall.  His old plant then grew to match a former chair’s height and has become a tree on its own.  His desk and computer became a rocky hill with a waterfall pouring down into a newly formed lake.  The room was long gone and there was no evidence of its existence.  All around him is nothing but a prehistoric forest with now houses, cars, schools, or anything modern.  Just a forest filled with Dinosaurs and a volcano in the background that was slowly erupting.  As the area around Jeff changed, his transformation is almost finished.<br />
<br />
He grew incredibly big and reached the 14th footmark but almost immediately, it stopped.  He was incredibly big that he was the size of a small building.  As his body stopped growing the rest of the changes were finishing up.  His skin was completely scaly and rough while his color was a combination of yellow and green.  His feet weren’t human as they were big with three sharp claws at the front and one poking out at the back.  His legs were bent a little to give him walking power and dominance.  His tail grew to the point that it was bigger then his body.  His back cracked more while his body pushed forward to the point that it was natural for him to walk in that stance.  His body twisted and contorted as his neck lengthened to the match his body.  His arms kept on shrinking, making it impossible to him to pump on his cock as hard as he could.  But if wasn’t Jeff’s arms that were changing, it was also his hands as well.  As his arms shrink, the fingers of his hands drew closer together and merged to form to digits while his nails sharpen to the point they were completely razor.  The muscles on his arms grew weaker and it was getting harder to him to stoke his dick.  But he managed to get through with one final touch and he felt it coming.  Almost immediately, Jeff roared out loud in a complete orgasm as the last of the changes took place.<br />
<br />
What’s left of his arms shrank away while the rest of his muscle tone withered away.  When they were finished, they were just tiny weak little stubs with two sharp fingers.  Only thing left was his head as it was going through the final phases.  His head was getting bigger as his skull deformed and shaped to match his body.  His voice was loud and it was a complete roar.  His nose grew big and stout as his face pushed forward for five to six feet wide.  In fact, his face was pushed forward so much that his eyes were at the side of his head.  And speaking of his eyes, the moment he opened them, his eyes had changed from bright blue to completely yellow with his pupils dilating to diamond shapes like that of a reptile.  His lips were long gone and he was showing off his sharp, dangerous teeth.  As his face pushed forward into a muzzle, more teeth grew into the back of his gums, making him look more dangerous then ever.  His earlobes shrank and faded away until they are nothing more then two holes between his head.  The last thing that happens was that his brain grew smaller and his mind began to alter.  Memories of his former life were quickly evaporating as more animalistic thoughts took place.  Soon enough, he had forgotten all about his previous life as memories or hunting, fighting, killing, and eating took place.  The moment the last of his cum spewed out and the self-orgy was finished, the transformation was done.<br />
<br />
In a matter of ten to fifteen minutes, Jeff was no more.  In his place was a dangerous and ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex both on the outside and inside.  And even though he no longer has a computer, the year of remaining as a T-Rex is already set.  The T-Rex surveyed the area and was completely hungry.  Feeling the need to eat, he walked away and started to search for some food.  During that time…</p>
