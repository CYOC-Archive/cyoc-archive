<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian began to prance anywhere he was taken, he feel the exhilaration of new hope from a wizard giving a promise. Llandros had found the traitor in his household and made an example of him for all there whether near or far as to his desire to keep what was his as pure. He had treated Mason to his being drastically demeaned, as his fate taught all there what they might expect from the wizard if they too tried to disorient his household.<br />
<br />
El-Sandros was horror struck from having seen where Llandros put to shame Mason, the eldest son of a managing man in the employ to a wizard. Even Tinker, the younger and ignorant a child got his greatest wish granted to him, although others noting what he liked to do and gained as his new vocation had all there thinking even less of him. The Llandros household was not as then set into proper order like he, the wizard might wish it, as from making a new example of the proper traitor led to others feeling Llandros was too harsh on Mason.<br />
<br />
The harsh duty put on Mason was the least of the concerns to Brian, he being exonerated soon from his having to live his life by being an animal, a horse Percheron, beast of burden. Although Brian was happily looking forward to having as his the niceties of again being as is a human, he knew down deep in his groin he would miss the wondrous feelings he felt by being a stallion horse used as a farm stud. His was as brutal a lifestyle being a horse as is an animal kept in a barn stall, devoid of friends and the respect he had earn while being a young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good day to you there Brian,&quot; greeted there the next morning a voice of a man that Brian did not know of him or his scent.<br />
<br />
Brian though still all horse could but snuffle or whinny his reply, though he just stood there being silent, he questioning as to who this new man was, or was doing.<br />
<br />
The new man set into the stall a bucket of water and another bucket filled with an unusual amount of grain. As Brian began to drink from the one bucket, the man left the stall, only to return and gift Brian a sizable amount of hay for him to eat.<br />
<br />
The strange man took his leave from Brian as then did Tinker arrive to do what were his most preferred job of cock cleaner to all the farm studs and sires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings to you sire Brian, this is a fine day, and for you about your duties today, I was told to come and service you. Please, do continue to eat your morning meal, while I begin my attending to washing your sheath, and cleaning your might shaft from the dried scales of encrusted semen and female juices.&quot; Tinker said, and he kneeling to the rear of Brian, he began a messaging of the sheath using a warm, wet, cloth.<br />
<br />
Brian trusted Tinker, he had come to the stallions often and by night cleaned their cocks before stroking them to an erect state before suckling on them, bring one or another to orgasmic pleasures. He, Brian liked what Tinker did, and as he stood there munching the grain given to him, he began to feel his cock being aroused. Slowly the great big cock began to unravel its cock body from out the large sheath. Brian liked the sensation of his cock becoming so bloated as a coming aroused state would lead to his becoming fully erect, made able of toying with, whether masturbating or then led to visit a horny mare.<br />
<br />
Having time to recall what delighted him more about being made a horse, Brian would contemplate often his thrill of being put into the pasture, or running as part of the farm herd. Although he highly relished his sexual encounters with mares, he had some fun, fond memories of Tinker coming and servicing a stallion. When as promised by Llandros that Brian would regain his being a human soon, he knew he would miss the fondled attentions of Tinker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are soon to be the real you sire Brian,&quot; Tinker said as he began his washing of the bloated horse cock.<br />
<br />
Brian snuffled his reply, as Tinker hearing the snuffle took it as if an answer to what he said. &quot;I would make a bet you shall miss the more brutal sex you so enjoyed by being a stallion, the fun feelings from this your large as so long a cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stallion offered no reply to what Tinker said, as Brian being a stallion was given reason to wonder then if he would miss that portion of his animal lifestyle, as after he became again a young man.<br />
<br />
Brian began an attempt at starting to masturbate using his cock to bump at his furred belly, as meanwhile Tinker was busy washing the cock, he was suddenly blunt-force batted in the chin by a rising horse cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, take it easy up there, I am at work down here!&quot; Tinker exclaimed, although he did not mind the feel of an aroused horse cock smacking at his face. Tinker smiled as he grabbed at the extended cock, took then a firm hold of it, began using his own tongue to purse at the large, rounded piss-hole, giving the stallion above a real sense of sensual a thrill.<br />
<br />
A moment later and Tinker having tongued the cock to its most heightened state of sexual readiness, he eyeing the flared trumpet bell shape to the Percheron cock, with his mouth wide open, Tinker using his fingers he coaxed the cock-head inside his mouth as his tongue began to tickle the aroused cock-head.<br />
<br />
Above Tinker, Brian the stallion ceased munching and focused his body to stiffen, feeling of something he relished almost as much as mating a mare. No pelvic moves were needed as from the cock came such waves of stimulating that Brian, stallion Percheron horse he was felt his groin stir and the gushed rush of his semen to flowing along the length of his cock.<br />
<br />
Tinker set kneeling and began to gag when the semen shot out from the cock piss-hole and went down his throat. One, two, three big gushing hot streams of semen were shot out the cock, as if from the stayed sensations, then a second wave of semen began spurting from the cock hole.<br />
<br />
Brian was too busy to take note or have any concern for young Tinker, he did not know that Tinker was near to being drowned by the vast volume of spent semen shot down his throat. Worsening his situation, the volume of semen gushing went both up and down in his throat. What semen went down his gullet ended up bloating fat his tummy. The force of spent semen moved as well upward, entering the sinus, blocking his nasal passages, and from the back force, the semen began draining from the corners of his eyes.<br />
<br />
Tinker, he with arms flagging from fright, set knelt there beneath the tall stallion, the horse cock filling his mouth as was the semen from the ejaculating stallion plastered full all else where he could capture some air to breathe. Brian having then spent his load, he if inside a mare would back out of her and then from a different need let go the wealth of urine held in his bladder before he would feel fully sated and able to relax after having enjoyed some mare sex fun.<br />
<br />
Tinker was near to dying of air starvation when the cock erupted with a hot stream of urine, affecting it to let the cock-head slip free from the mouth where it was bloated and stuck. Tinker just laid there on his back feeling then the stout stream of horse urine soaking his shirt, his chest, his face with what otherwise he might have thought to be something vile. Indeed, as able to breathe again, Tinker let Brian do his thing and the piss showering continued to where the cock began again to fold its way back up and entering inside the large sheath.<br />
<br />
Finishing his urinating, Brian then stepped over where he had taken a hearty piss to see there Tinker lying face-up and soaked in urine, he gasping to try and breathe.<br />
<br />
Brian whinnied aloud his sense of surprise from seeing Tinker in such a state of dismay.<br />
<br />
As the stallion took to nervously pacing his stall, Tinker had time to collect his thoughts, as snorting, clear the packed semen from out his nose. &quot;Holy cow there Brian, you almost killed me,&quot; Tinker exclaimed, he getting to again a kneeling position, began couching, as puking out coagulating chunks of horse semen from his throat.<br />
<br />
Luckily for Tinker, his timing being there with Brian and doing what he did, there was not a live human soul capable of seeing the sexually stimulating scene. The barn walls own big ears of other horses, some of what who were listening were born human and damned to being as animals permanently. A whinny of obvious concern turned Tinker to replying, as said, &quot;I am OK now, be calm my dearest Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
A questioning &quot;Huh,&quot; came from Brian, this being one manner of communicating left to him while burdened by being a horse.<br />
<br />
Hack, cough, cough, did Tinker as he stood up on his feet and looked at Brian. &quot;You might remember Alice, she was the bar maid servicing the knights and occasional royal types visiting the main house. She would do for them what I just did for you, or she was until she offered her niceties to Llandros and they got seen by Hillary. She being as much a witch both socially and empowered, she did wait until Alice was alone before she struck, as caused my friend Alice to become a brood mare.<br />
<br />
When you gain your return to being a an, beware then of Hillary and her advances. The closer she gets the more likely she will attack and do it from behind. She shows a nice front, a smiling congenial face, but behind that face is a scheming mind, she hates men, and that includes her scheming husband. I heard tell of Llandros traveling to a wizard gathering and while there, he was away from Hillary, he had the desire for the company of a prettier woman. He offered his pleasuring to several women, but they knowing of his powers knew to stay away. His wife, Hillary kept a watch using I suppose her crystal ball, and wishing to stop her husband from any fun fornicating, she went to be with him, flying there on her broom.<br />
<br />
As told to me, that Hillary with Llandros were leaving the inn where they had stayed, going to the wizardly Sabbath meeting, one of the women he tried to coax saw him, she with a more common man were entering the inn for a place to frolic. When she saw Llandros and he her, she said to him as seeing then Hillary, she said, &quot;Greetings fine sir, I see you found some cheap as sordid company for a fun night! Ha,ha,ha,ha, I wish I was there then, but maybe for my better I was not, as Hillary more than the Master might well have made me to come and service her with my mouth and tongue.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Tinker was about to take his leave from Brian, the stall door opened and there stood Hillary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse my having overheard your telling of that old joke, but that lady in the story has since that night found her fun from the man she was as escorting, they being still as cow and bull living together on a farm not far from our bigger farm. You need to beware of me, as my feelings are easily hurt, and what hurts me I give hurt!<br />
<br />
Come Brian I have a full day planned for you, as several fine mares have need for your servicing of them. Usually I would not lower myself with dealings of animal mating, but three of the mares were born human and you mating with them makes their new forms as their permanent selves. Do as I ask and when again in manly a form I shall offer you my good will.&quot; She said, as Tinker scurried away, he fearful for his own bodily self.</p>
