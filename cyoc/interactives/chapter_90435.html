<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of all the things she wanted to be, Janet decided what she wanted to become...a mother. Janet truly loved her mom, and her mom seemed like the happiest woman in the world. Janet craved to understand the love a mother can have for her child, to literally create a life in her womb, then raise it to become a happy, healthy and successful human being. She would be a truly kind and loving parent. So...why wait? She imagined herself as the perfect mother: kind, compassionate, and dedicated to her children. The amulet shone bright, and her transformation began!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation began as she looked into the mirror to see the results.  The changers were minor, as she grew a little bit.  Her shirt began to crawl up her chest, slowly but carefully. She felt her breasts begin to swell as they grew. Her hair changed to a darker shade of brown. Fortunately, it seemed like her skirt and stockings weren&#39;t changing. Maybe she&#39;d be fully clothed for this change?<br />
<br />
Janet was a little miffed. Her shirt vanished and leaved her top part nearly naked. At least she still had her bra on this time...and to her embarrassment, her breasts had grown much larger. Still, they didn&#39;t feel too massive, and her bra still supported them well. Meanwhile, she grew a bit taller, and her face seemed almost a little bit...older? Her hair started to grow out a little longer as well. Still, so far so good!<br />
<br />
Janet felt the changes ripple throughout her body. She grew even taller than before, and she felt strange. Her youth was leaving as her energy seemed depleted as an older age, but she didn&#39;t feel uncomfortable about it in the slightest. A beautiful white shirt appeared around her chest, leaving her midriff open. Her hair restyled itself, looking more neat and tidy while also growing in length. Her face became a little bit thinner, though she still looked pretty similar to before. As she was observing this, she felt something odd in her stomach, well, a bit lower. It almost felt like something was...growing down there. Was this what pregnancy felt like?<br />
<br />
Janet felt strange for a moment. Looking down, she realized her hair had grown longer...but more importantly, her belly was huge! It looked kind of like her stomach had a pillow inside it or something. It felt very sensitive to the touch. She could tell immediately that there was a baby inside there...her baby. The baby she had with her wonderful husband? But was she married? Janet understood that the mental changes were coming. She felt compassion begin to overwhelm her already warm heart. Still, it wasn&#39;t over yet!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s shirt grew longer, covering her still expanding belly. She felt her stomach, touching it lovingly and tenderly. Her baby was in there. She felt it carefully, and could feel it kicking lightly against the walls of its protective &quot;shell&quot;. While it was uncomfortable for her at first, it became oddly soothing. Every kick was a reassurance of the life she lived...and the lives she had created. She rubbed it tenderly, letting her immense love flow into it. This feeling was great; surely she&#39;d be the perfect mother to her children...<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was finally complete. She felt her womb swell one last time. It was extremely large, she knew that very soon she&#39;d give birth to a beautiful baby girl. She felt incredibly comfortable. She wasn&#39;t scared in the slightest...after all, it&#39;s not like this was her first time.  Looking around, she could see that reality has changed and she was still in her room.  Maybe the altered reality hasn’t affected her yet.  But then when she looked to the dresser, she noticed the picture has changed.  Instead of her and her family, it was her older self with a family of her own.  She saw her husband, John, who was her best friend in school and he looked handsome when he’s older.  She also saw a little girl was the spitting image of her mother when she was younger.  She smiled widely and knew that she now has a family of her own and a child she will cherish forever. <br />
<br />
As she was looking at the picture, she heard someone call her at the door.  “Moooom!”  She turned to the direction of the door and saw her daughter, Jessica, at the door with a bit of shock in her face.  “What are you doing in my room?”  Janet was a bit shocked to see that her daughter was at the door looking a little confused.  “Uh…” she said with a few little words to speak about, “I was just cleaning it up.  Can’t have my precious daughter have a messy room.  You know you’re going to have a new sister on the way and she doesn’t want to see an older sibling.”  Jessica raised an eyebrow and said, “Okay…  Wanna watch pink princess with me? Pretty pretty please!&quot;. The love was radiating from Janet&#39;s heart as she said, “But of course honey.  You go start the DVD, I’ll be there in a second.”  Jessica squealed in delight as she headed back downstairs to prepare the movie.  As she was gone, Janet had a warm smile and was happy to have a daughter she cared so much about.  She loved her family, with her wonderful husband John, and her beautiful daughter Jessica...and soon, her second daughter as well.  Leaving her old room, she was ready to life as a perfect mother.</p>
