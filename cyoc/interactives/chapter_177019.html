<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So, littl- I mean big sis, what shall we do next?” Jeff asked Olivia. “I want to go to the main city and have fun with my size”. “Alright, let’s go, my master”. “Ooooh master, I like that, but I’m not your master little Jeff; I’m still your little sister, just 25 times bigger.”, Livie said. “Whatever, you say, master” Jeff said jokingly. “Oh stop it, you”, Livie remarked. She grabbed her tiny older brother in her huge palm and wrapped her fingers gently around him, and lifted him effortlessly and carried him in her palm by her side. Olivia headed over to the city ready to play around with all the tiny citizens and buildings. On her way she felt something crush under her foot. “Ow, what was that”, Olivia said. She lifted up her bare foot and checked what she had stepped on. Turns out she stepped on a parked car which was now flattened under Livie’s foot without her noticing. “Oops, hope nobody noticed.” Livie said, but a lot of people noticed, and they were either running away or hiding from the giant young girl. “Chill out, guys, I’m not going to hurt you.” She told them. She put Jeff into her pocket, and bent down to pick up one of the tiny bystanders. She dangled the 20 year old man in front of her face. “Hey there little guy, what’s your name?” she asked. “d-d-Derek”. Meanwhile, Jeff was in Olivia’s pocket, waiting for whatever’s next. ‘Gosh, I can feel Livie’s body heat very well being this close to her thigh’ Jeff thought. He rested himself on Livie’s pants, the part closest to her skin. It felt like a nice, hot summer day. They reached the city and this is where the real fun begins. Livie was as tall as most of the buildings, and taller than some. She looked into the windows and saw all of the little people working at their desks. She ran around, carefully avoiding all of the people below, but unfortunately stepping on a few. “Sorry!” she said as she danced through the streets. She then saw a girl in an alley getting robbed by four men. “HEY”, Livie yelled as she hurried over there. “You men better stop this right now, and turn yourselves in to the police. They tried to run away with the girl but Livie stopped them by blocking them by sitting in front of them with her legs surrounding them. She grabbed the girl from them and placed her away from the thugs. “Go on now, you’re safe”, Livie told the woman. “Now to deal with you guys”, she said with a mean look on her pretty face. She got up, and said, “Go on guys I’ll give you a head start”. They ran away, but not far enough away. Livie waited 10 seconds for the robbers to get as far away as they could. It took her two steps to catch up to them. [WARNING, the next part is pretty violent]. She stopped one of the men by placing her toe on his head, and then lowered her foot and crushed him. The next guy she lifted up, winded up her arm, and threw him onto the ground as hard as she could and he went splat on the ground. The third guy she picked up, dangled him over her open mouth, and dropped him in. She chewed him up a bit and swallowed him. “Mmmm, tasty”. Finally, she grabbed the last guy,  and put him level with her face. She stared at him directly into his eyes, pure intimidation. After about five seconds, without breaking eye contact for a second, Olivia squeezed her hand tighter and tighter. The man screamed as his bones were breaking, she just kept staring, and crushing the man with her feminine, young girl hand. The rush she got was insane when the man died                     was insane. She took a second to look around at what she did. She took Jeff out of her pocket and placed him on top of a short building, probably a fifth of her height. She then placed her huge foot on the building in a victory pose, and yelled, “I AM THE QUEEN OF THE WORLD”. The whole city probably heard her voice. Then, the building collapsed under the pressure of her bus sized foot. Jeff fell onto the top of Olivia’s foot which broke his fall and he was not harmed. “Gosh that building was so flimsy, although it did have the weight of another building on top of it.” Jeff was in disbelief, his little sister just crushed an entire building under her foot, by accident. He didn’t even know that she just killed 4 men. Then they heard sirens coming, and the military with it. They started shooting guns at her, but all of the bullets just bounced off her skin. “Hey stop that tickles”, she laughed. She grabbed one of the helicopters out of the sky and flew it around like a child who plays with a toy airplane. She set the helicopter back down, and sat down in front of the force. The chief of officers got out a megaphone and yelled, “PLEASE DESIST NOW, OR WE WILL HAVE TO DETAIN YOU BY FORCE”. “Chill out officer, I’m not going to harm you all”, she reached down and picked him up. “And besides, I’m 100 feet tall, there is nothing you can to stop me, I’m a pretty big girl, and as it turns out, I’m able to crush a building without even trying, so you better tell your pals down there to get out of here, or I might have to wipe you all out by crushing each and every one of you with just my big toe.” She laid the officer down on the ground and put her big toe on his body, “Is that clear?”. The officer commanded the force to back down and Livie lifted her toe off of him. “Good, but just remember, I don’t mean any harm to you guys, I’m just a little girl out here having fun.” Livie told them. She grabbed Jeff in her massive hand and gave him a big kiss on his whole body. “Let’s go home Jeff, it’s getting pretty late.” Olivia walked them back home and then quickly realized, that she was way too big for the house. “Hey Jeff can you shrink me back down so I can fit in the house”, Livie asked. “Sure little sis, should shrink you back to your normal height?” “Actually can you still keep me tall, I like being big, just make me small enough to be able to walk around in the house”. Jeff aimed the chronivac at Livie and shrunk her down until she was 8’5”, 3 feet taller than Jeff. “It feels weird being this short again, I was starting to get used to being a giantess”. “It feels weird to me as well, I was getting used to you being a giantess”, Jeff agreed. ‘Today was a wild day’, Livie thought. “Alright Livie, it’s time for bed, and... how are you going to fit into bed.” “Hey Jeff can I um, sleep with you in mom and dad’s bed tonight.” Livie asked. Jeff was excited to hear that question. “Yeah, I’d love to”, Jeff responded. “Yay!” Livie squealed. She picked Jeff up and kissed him on his lips. She tilted her head a bit, and so did Jeff. He felt her pulling him in and he closed his eyes. They shared each others lips for about 20 seconds straight. They pulled apart and they were both blushing. “Let’s go to bed now” Livie said. She carried Jeff into their parents’ room. And they both took most of their clothes off and climbed into bed together. Olivia wrapped her arms around Jeff’s body and pressed him against her warm skin. “Goodnight little bro” Livie whispered. “Goodnight big sis”, Jeff responded to his younger, but bigger sister. After a good night’s sleep, the two woke up. “What should we do today Livie?”</p>
