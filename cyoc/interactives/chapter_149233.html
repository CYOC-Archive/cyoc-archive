<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite being the first Dinotopian, it took Heather a far longer time to move to Dinosaur City. Of course, for starters, it wasn&#39;t a simple matter of moving house between states, especially when it was easier to fly than to drive. But they&#39;ve had their stuff packed up in a moving unit and had it shipped ahead of them. But there were several other things that kept Heather and Jeremy from moving right away. First there was Heather&#39;s exhibition  match with Regina for the start of the Mesozoic Fight Club. Then Polly had her synchronized swimming event which took too long to happen. But finally, Heather and Jeremy were ready to move to their new home.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Heather and Jeremy walked out of the terminal at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport. It was inconvenient that Dinosaur City didn&#39;t have the space for its own airport, but there had to be some sacrifices made. At least the airport here had enough room for the jumbo jet that the two <i>Syntixisaurus rexes</i> had to take. &quot;I&#39;m glad we already sent most of our belongings ahead,&quot; said Heather, &quot;It would have been too awkward to have to carry all of our stuff from the airport.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think our personal load isn&#39;t equally divided,&quot; grunted Jeremy. While Heather was carrying some bags, the lion&#39;s share of the luggage was being toted by Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the man&#39;s job to do most of the heavy lifting,&quot; said Heather, &quot;Besides, you need to use your muscles more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should have gotten a trolley,&quot; said Jeremy with annoyance.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, they didn&#39;t have to go far. Tyra and Rex were waiting for them at Departures. &quot;Oh, there&#39;s my favorite granddaughter. Come here and give your ol&#39; gran a hug,&quot; said Tyra. Jeremy had a feeling something was off, considering Tyra almost never referred to herself as Heather&#39;s grandmother. But his recent assignment as pack mule made him just stand and watch while his wife walked over to her grandmother. As soon as she was in reach, Tyra grabbed Heather&#39;s horn and yanked her hard. &quot;What in blazes took ya&#39;ll so long?&quot; she demanded, &quot;Ya made me miss June. Everyone knows weddin&#39;s are meant for June! How am I supposed to get hitched without you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, the URP was delayed...&quot; started Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think ya could have had the time to come over here and be at mah weddin&#39; before headin&#39; back to watch that swimmin&#39; show,&quot; snapped Tyra, &quot;You&#39;re lucky we can get the bakery to reschedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we don&#39;t eat cake,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ain&#39;t loadin&#39; it up with chocolate. But I&#39;m havin&#39; a lemon cake for my weddin&#39;,&quot; snapped Tyra.<br />
<br />
Jeremy glanced over at Rex, who gave him a helpless look. &quot;Uh, maybe we should move this discussion to our new residence,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Tyra snorted before turning to Rex. &quot;Rex, be a sweetie and take some of those bags,&quot; said Tyra. With that, she walked out, dragging Heather behind her.<br />
<br />
As Rex took some of the luggage, Jeremy asked, &quot;Has she been like this the whole time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, though she&#39;s gotten rather short on patience the longer you guys took with getting here,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has she gone full Bridezilla?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully no,&quot; said Rex, &quot;She&#39;s being reasonable. Though I hope the dress will go okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The dress?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see what I mean,&quot; said Rex.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It was a big relief for Heather that she wasn&#39;t going to be sharing a home with Tyra. As much as she loved her grandmother, she sometimes made Heather want to tear her hair out (if she still had hair). They weren&#39;t living in the same apartment building or even sharing a duplex. They both had their own separate houses, which, while looking like something straight out of the Flintstones, had a perfectly modern interior. Jeremy and Heather&#39;s belongings still needed to be unpacked, but at least most of the furniture were in the appropriate rooms. The only caveat was that Tyra and Rex lived right next door. At least Tyra won&#39;t do anything to embarrassing, like sunbathing in the nude.<br />
<br />
Jeremy and Heather didn&#39;t have long to admire their new home as they were soon be pulled away to different appointments. Heather was going with Tyra to get her bridesmaid dress fitted while Jeremy and Rex were going to the Horizon Labs building in Dinosaur City, with a stop at the gym later.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The dress fitting wasn&#39;t so bad. Heather remembered the dress fitting for her own wedding and bridesmaids didn&#39;t have so much attention on them. &quot;I was a little worried you&#39;d make me dress up in faux animal skins,&quot; said Heather, looking down at her dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, too gauche,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;I do have some class, ya know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how&#39;s your dress?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll just love this,&quot; said Tyra before getting her wedding dress out.<br />
<br />
Heather did like the dress...though it looked very familiar. &quot;Is that my wedding dress?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;Good thing we&#39;re a similar size. Though it had to be let out in the chest a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like this is a violation of privacy,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;Your mother got married in my old dress. This is basically the same principle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except you&#39;re my-&quot; started Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the bride, I can be whoever I want to be,&quot; said Tyra with a snarl.<br />
<br />
Heather shut her mouth quickly. There were some things you didn&#39;t want to provoke a woman about, especially not a saurian woman.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Jeremy was glad that his work station in the local Horizon Labs was already accommodated for his size. It even included a keyboard that was larger and made of thicker plastic. He was still a little slower at typing because of his lesser amount of fingers, but he was still able to work.<br />
<br />
After that, he and Rex took a little guys&#39; time at the gym. Jeremy wasn&#39;t really the type to spend time with others like this, which made him suspect the others were trying to intervene before he got into a sedimentary lifestyle. &quot;It&#39;s not like I avoid the gym, you know,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;And I&#39;m not putting on weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still a good idea to keep regular exercise,&quot; said Rex, &quot;It&#39;s possible for even Animalians to get out of shape if we don&#39;t maintain our bodies. And things would get awkward if you pulled a muscle or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still doubtful about the equipment,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; asked Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they&#39;re made with rocks,&quot; said Jeremy flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Super-dense rock,&quot; said Rex, &quot;You&#39;ll get more exercise out of them than you&#39;ll think. Besides, most of the machines just look like they&#39;re made of stone, bone, and wood. It&#39;s as valid a gym as any other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy sighed and said, &quot;Well, I guess we&#39;ll be spending more time here together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not me so much,&quot; said Rex, &quot;I&#39;m going to be busy with the wedding and then there&#39;s the honeymoon afterwards. Tyra and me will be going to Spain to see Irena. But I&#39;ve already set you up with a personal trainer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personal trainer?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Just then, a very large theropod Dinotopian walked over to them. He was easily bigger and taller than Jeremy. The Dinotopian looked down at Jeremy and said, &quot;Mr. Green? I&#39;m going to be your new trainer here. You can call me Mr. M.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy gulped. He was suddenly wondering if he was going to have a rougher time than his wife.</p>
