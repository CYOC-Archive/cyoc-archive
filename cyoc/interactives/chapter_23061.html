<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>She had barely started to pull open the door when she heard Kyle's voice once more.
<P>"Transform or Dare?" he said.
<P>"You learned your lesson that quickly?" she said. "I guess I underestimated y-- GACK!" Jennifer was quickly silenced as Kyle attempted to strangle her with what felt like a leather belt. He had snuck up behind her without her noticing thanks to the way his voice was being bounced off the walls. She frantically tried to grasp the belt with her hands, but her fingers were much too thick to get a grip. She attempted to shake him off, but he held fast.
<P>Thinking quickly, she backed into a stall, slamming Kyle against the door. His scream nearly deafened her as his tail was crushed by the impact. His grip loosened and she pulled the belt free of her throat.
<P>It made a harsh clanging sound, and she looked at it to find that it wasn't a belt, it was a collar. The black leather had pointed silver studs at each inch. In the middle, a giant brass cowbell was attached to it. Looking more closely, she discovered that it was embossed with a name. <i>Her</i> name.
<P>"Time's up," Kyle said, wincing and rubbing his tail. "You get both."
<P>"You prick," she gasped. This was his plan all along. If she tried to get revenge on him, he was ready to confront her with another round of cursing.
<P>"If you had just left me alone, you probably could have found a friend to help you change you back to normal," Kyle lectured. "But you decided on revenge. Revenge begets revenge...," he chuckled at his own words. "Well, first I'm going to dare you to take off that ridiculous shirt and allow me to put that collar on you. And once I'm done cursing you, I dare you to transform me back to normal.
<P>"Don't worry, it's not like you'll be cold or anything with all that fur," he continued as Jennifer threw off her shirt. He took the collar from her and pulled it around her neck, fastening it tight. "Nobody is going to care what you're wearing, or what you're not wearing, as is the case. Nobody is going to think that it's unusual for you to be a cowgirl or anything of the sort, except for you and me of course."
<P>Jennifer attempted to remove the collar now that she had control of her body again. However, her slippery hoofed fingers couldn't manage to work the small clasp.
<P>"Since you're obviously not comfortable with your body, let's make some adjustments." He scanned her over. "I like the fur on your breasts, or udders, or whatever you could call them," he said. "But you really don't look that much like a cow with them. Even though you pull off the spots quite well. Let's see you grow a real udder. But slowly. From now on, everything you eat or drink that doesn't get digested into your body for nutrition will be specially processed and turned into milk for your new, true udder. I like how you were able to retain your hourglass look, by the way. Not easy for a cow. How about you stay that thin as well, no matter how much you eat. Instead of converting into extra fat, food will simply change into milk for the udder."
<P>"If you think I want to be milked for the rest of my life, you can forget it!" Though Jennifer couldn't deny that she enjoyed her first milking experience, she knew it just wasn't natural.
<P>"Okay then...," he thought. "Then how about this? All of your teats, on your breasts and your new udder, will be closed tightly. You'll barely be able to squeeze a few drops at a time out of any of them. Of course, this might lead to some pain later on...but under certain, special conditions you will be able to be milked freely."
<P>"Conditions?"
<P>"You'll know it when it happens," Kyle smirked. "Look on the bright side, you'll never have to go to the bathroom again."
<P>"You're a pretty sick kid."
<P>"I know," he smiled. "But you're a pretty mean cow. Say, I just had another thought. Let's give you a special kind of milk...an addictive concoction that will transform anyone who drinks it into a cowgirl like yourself. While we're at it, let's make it clear that I'm immune to its effects. Now, how about taking care of this?" He held up his furry tail.
<P>Jennifer performed the Transform or Dare curse exactly how Kyle specified, and his tail shrank back into his body.
<P>"That's a good girl. If you're nicer to me and everybody else, I just might change you back in a week or two. Oh, look at that. Late for class." He walked past Jennifer and out the door.
<P>Jennifer looked in the mirror, forlorn. As she watched the fur on her stomach recede and the skin turn pink, she wondered if she actually deserved this. Maybe some form of punishment, but this whole cowgirl situation was something nobody should be forced to experience.
<P>Her cow udder started to form, partially under her skirt. As the the waistband grew tighter, she could feel four teats pushing from inside the skirt as well. Although the flesh scarcely protruded a few inches at this point, she had a feeling that was soon to change.</p>
