<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Willow turned when she herd heavy footsteps aproching from around the corner, the guard drew his sword and leaped to hide against the wall, his sword raised and ready to strike, the female satyr and darted to the stable doors trying desperately to open the large doors, only to find them jamed in place, something on the other side holding the doors firmly shut.<br />
<br />
The footsteps drew closer and Willow&#39;s hands wrapped themselves around her babies, holding her belly protectively, if she was to be struck then she was going to defend her children, she had already experienced loosing one child in a way, she was not going to do it again, suddenly the guard swung his sword, letting out a weardly high pitched battle cry before his sword stopped short.<br />
<br />
Mazy gulped loudly as the cold metal blade stopped just short of her neck, so close she could hear the ring of the metal as the wind blew against it, she gripped Rose&#39;s hand tight as her other hand clutched over her belly &quot;ummmm my lady, can you ask your guard not to remove my head please&quot; said Mazy in a small voice, her breath light and quick with fear, Willow let out a shocked gasp as the Knight steped back, shocked that he had almost killed one of Lady Willow&#39;s servents and knocked into Willow&#39;s sholder, Willow tried to brace herself for the impending impact of the wooden floor, but was caught by the satyr and the Knight, but then the Knight let out a high pitched moan as Willow&#39;s hand shot out to his chest.<br />
<br />
It was only then that Willow realised that the hand she had braced herself against the guards armored chest plate, was the hand that held the purple crystal, the impact splitting it in two as it shot through the guards armour and into his chest, but the impact had loosened the guards chestplate and helmet, and once everyone had helped Lady Willow upright the Knights armor came clattering loudly to the floor, it turned out that he was actually a she, the elf woman that stood infront of Willow was drop dead gorgeous, with silky white skin, almost shining in the candle light of the hallway, her eyes shining in sapphire blue and her lips so red they looked to be made of roses, her hair was a deep rich brown, tied back in a net that covered her hair, her neck was slim and strong, with her small amount of muscles along her neck and shoulders flexing naturally under her silky skin, her breasts had been strapped down to hide her curves and her stomach was sculpted with a fair amount of muscle.<br />
<br />
The guard yelped in shock and covered herself, her cheek flushing red in embarrassment as she looked at the floor, Willow guessed that she didn&#39;t intend for anyone to find out her secret, everyone stood still, mouths agape and eyes wide from the knights secret being revealed, but Willow waddled over to her Knight and placed her hand gently on her sholder, the Knight looked up at Lady Willow with tears in her eyes &quot;forgive me my lady, it was never my intention to keep my true self a secret from you its just-&quot; she was cut of as Willow placed a finger to her Knights lips &quot;Are you not my Knight?, sworn to defend me and my line of your own free will?&quot; Asked Willow as she raised an eyebrow to the Knight who immediately corrected herself and placed the tip of her blade against the floor and rested her head atop it&#39;s hilt, taking a knee now facing her lady, &quot;of corse my lady, I am your sword, your shield, your friend and your guardian, I have pledged to guard your life until the void of death takes me back to the earth&quot; said the Knight determined as she gazed at the floor.<br />
<br />
Willow gave a nod as she looked at her last Knight with pride &quot;and may I have the name of my loyal guard?&quot; She asked as the Knight looked up at her &quot;it&#39;s Luna my lady, Luna Evenwood&quot; said Rose as she once again looked down, Willow smiled and placed her hands on her knights armoured sholders &quot;then rise and fight mistress Luna, Knight of the western woods&quot; declared Willow as Luna stood up, a look of pride on her face, you then looked around to see Mazy and Rose helping the satyr maid unlock the door, using their newly acquired knowledge of fire magic to melt the locks Willow smiled at this, so early into their training and they were already taking to magic like a duck to water.<br />
<br />
Willow them looked to see miss Luna trying to get her chestplate back on, yet she seemed to be struggling with the straps along the sides &quot;you ok over there&quot; Asked Willow as she leaned up against the wall, cupping her hands under her belly to ease some of the weight off her hips, Luna then let out a grunt as her chestplate sprung up into her face as her straps once again snapped open, she then let out a groan of frustration &quot;this is why I wrap my breasts, thwis things make putting on armour so hard, especially when I asked for mens armour&quot; she sighed before grunting in anger as she threw her chestplate against the far wall, everyone turning as it clattered to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you know what forget it, I apologise for what I&#39;m about to do my lady&quot; said the satyr as she placed her hand on Lunas chestplate and it began to melt into a liquid, everyone watched in shock as the satyr girl then lifted up a one handed forging hammer, a dragons crest on both sides that glowed red, the satyr thwn blushed as her hoof made small circles on the floor &quot;sorry my lady, my father and mother were blacksmiths, our family has been for generations, all blessed with the ability to reform metal in our hands, untill I decided that I wanted to serve you instead of following my ancestors&quot; she said as she smiled at Lady Willow before she walked over to the door, swinging her new hammer around and around in her hand before throwing it at the door.<br />
<br />
The hammer burst into flames in mid air, the flames forming into the head of a dragon as it let out a deafening roar before colliding and smashing straight through the door, the satyr then turned to look at Willow, straightening her dress and appren before bowing her head &quot; the names Trisha of house dragonblood my lady, at your service&quot; she said, Willow only smiled and nodded as she stood up, then Willow heard the sound of fabric ripping and turned to its source.<br />
<br />
Looking to her left Willow saw Luna frozen in shock, her hands still on her sword as she put it back on her hip, the ripping sound continued before a long stretch of fabric fell to the floor and Luna lurched forward, her hands clutching over her breasts as they practically lunged forward, almost dragging Luna along with them, Luna then looked up in shock at Willow, her hands cupped over the tops of her steadily growing breasts  her nipples now bright pink and erect as some unseen force stimulated them, Willow and Luna then watched in fascination as something began to move from underneath her breasts skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmmm, Lady Willow....you might want to come and see this there&#39;s a-  HIT THE DECK!!!&quot; screamed Rose from the stables as Willow&#39;s vision was engulfed in light...</p>
