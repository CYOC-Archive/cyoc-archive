<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to go with the cheerleader&#39;s outfit. After all, you always envied them as a teen. They were the most popular people in school, and could get whatever they wanted and whoever they wanted just by being so popular. You grimace in rage at the memory. You shake your head, trying to clear your thoughts. Finally, you perk up the courage to rush to the changing rooms, praying to whatever deity might be there that you don&#39;t get seen with the dress. The changing rooms are surprisingly large and luxurious for a shop so small. And they appear to be themed to different outfits. You search for a small while and find the one labeled &quot;Cheerleader&quot;. You enter it and shut the door, immediately regretting your decision. You snap out of your trance and turn around to walk out of the door and put it back, only to find a set of lockers in front of you. You open all of them, only to find that they&#39;re just that, lockers. You panic for a while, wondering what the hell is going on. As you&#39;re panicking, a thought begins to creep in to your head. A sort of guilty pleasure of what you were about to do. I mean, sure, it&#39;s frowned upon, but it&#39;s not illegal or anything, right? You continue looking for a way out, this time looking to the outfit you left on the floor a little more than would be normal. But that&#39;s okay, right? A few seconds walking around in it wouldn&#39;t hurt, would it? You take a few hesitative steps towards the outfit and take it out of it&#39;s packaging piece by piece. The main color is a hot magenta with white highlights. The front of the low cut top says TG on it. You assume that  it&#39;s just the imaginary school it was designed for and lay it out neatly on the table. The next thing you pull out is the bra. It&#39;s got to be an E-cup at least. It&#39;s lace, and slightly transparent with a hole for nipples to poke through and arouse adolescent males even more. You chuckle a little at that thought. The next piece is the panties, which are ridiculously revealing, nigh on g-string. You get the feeling that those are going to be a little difficult to get on. Out next comes a pair of magenta nylon tights that would reach up to just below your manly bits. You keep rummaging through and placing the items of clothing neatly on the bench; A pair of white high-heels with straps, a miniskirt that would hug anyone&#39;s curves, two hairbands for putting your hair up in pigtails, white gloves that go up to where your sleeves begin, there&#39;s even a makeup kit with magenta lipstick, pink eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, a foundation that would suggest a nice tan, the whole kit and caboodle.  You sigh with a smile. It&#39;s the moment of truth...<br />
<br />
You undress completely and look yourself up an down in the reflection on the locker. After much more contemplation, the temptation still wins over you and you pick up the panties. You stick one leg in and then the other, both slowly. You then gradually manage to pull it further and further up, it making whatever it brushes tingle a little. You get it up to the top, put the patch on your junk, settle the rest in, and wait. You don&#39;t know why you&#39;re waiting, you just have the urge to do so. Suddenly, your penis begins to throb with untold pleasure and you groan, it continues throbbing, getting harder and harder with each pulse, but strangely it doesn&#39;t seem to be getting any larger. In fact, the patch is going towards you instead of away, your junk is actually retreating in to your body. You don&#39;t worry about it too much as you&#39;re in such pleasure. Eventually the penis itself is gone, but still retreating through your body to make a uterus, your testicles also begin retreating and shifting into ovaries.The foreskin the folds over and fills up with a little bit of flesh, creating a clitoris and vulva, which begin secreting a small amount of fluid at your pleasure. You begin to moan again as your rear fills with fat and your hips expand. It stops, leaving you breathing quite heavily. You look down at yourself and realize that, aside from the bits covered by the panties, nothing had changed. You then decide to continue with your lower body and put on the tights, the same tingling feeling as before wherever they touch your body. You wait for a while longer in anticipation. It was perfectly fine now, and you felt no guilt, as you were actually a woman. Suddenly, you feel your body hair being sucked back inside by an invisible vacuum. Your calves thin out and you shrink a bit. But after that, the fat gathered from your calves and a little more appears in your thighs now giving you shapely, womanly legs to go with your ass and tight cunnie. You put on the skirt but anything that could changed has already been covered. You then equip the high heels. Which, after the waiting, make you wince a little as your feet snap in, becoming dainty and fitting the shoes. You now have the complete lower body of a woman, it&#39;s time to do the upper body... <br />
<br />
You first apply the bra and you moan more and more as flesh begins to fill your chest, your nipples become erect, grow in size and become darker. It eventually stops, and your bust is nearly breaking the bra. You grab your breast and pleasure runs through you, signalling that it&#39;s real. You slip the shirt over you and tuck it in to your skirt. You gasp as it pushes your waist in to turn you into a very nice hourglass figure. Your gut then sucks in to become a flat, sexy core.You wince a little as your back snaps into an arch that pushes out your T&A. Your shoulders also snap in as your neck shrinks and your adam&#39;s apple disappears.  You speak to yourself a little. &quot;Like, testing, one two, one two. Like, oh my god. My voice is like, sooo much of a valley girl stereotype!&quot; You decide that that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing and carry on. You equip the gloves next, pulling them up as far as they will go. Your arms deflate a little and your hands snap in, becoming dainty and feminine. You feel your fingernails extend and, though you can&#39;t see it, you somehow know that you now have magenta nail polish on. You finally move on to the makeup, brushing your fringe aside as you apply the foundation, and all of your remaining body hair falls off as your skin bronzes all over. You suddenly feel a sunkissed warmth rush over you. You then wince as your face rounds and becomes more heart shaped, your facial hair almost completely disappears too, aside from your eyebrows, which thin out and arch. After applying the eyeshadow, your eyes widen and become a deep shade of blue. Applying mascara suddenly makes your lashes grow even more than they would with normal mascara, until they&#39;re fully feminine. You then apply the blush, which raises your cheekbones and fills your cheeks slightly. You apply the lipstick and your lips fill and turn in to a permanent semi-pout. You take what little hair you can and stick it through the hairbands. Suddenly, two tails cascade to your upper back and turn a bleach blonde, they become more voluminous and gain a bit of shine. That&#39;s all, you think to yourself. You look around to see that a door has appeared and a girl now similar to your age peeps through it.<br />
&quot;Like, Steph!&quot; She begins, &quot;Come on! We&#39;ve got some work to do!&quot;<br />
&quot;Coming, Case!&quot; You don&#39;t know how you know her name, but new memories have snuggled in with your old ones. &quot;Just, like, give me a few seconds and I&#39;ll totally be there.&quot; Casey closes the door again and you sigh. &quot;Well, this is my new life.&quot; You think to yourself. With a deep breath, you step out of the door into...</p>
