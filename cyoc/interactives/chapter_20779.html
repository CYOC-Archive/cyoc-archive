<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With June now a 16-year-old 6’4” tall beauty, Ty could see little at the moment he could do to improve her. He admired her sumptuous curves and full tight breasts and felt his penis ache with the need for release. She was his girlfriend now, after all. A sudden thought occurred to Ty. Where did that leave Mark and Dustin?! Mark couldn’t be June’s husband anymore and Dustin couldn’t be her child. Ty looked over the frozen masturbating June once more and sighed. He had a couple of loose ends to tie up before he could enjoy his new lover. “June,” Ty said, “you can unfreeze now.” June reanimated and immediately continued pleasuring herself, starting to moan and thrust her fingers into an increasingly wet slit.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned. “June, why don’t you go upstairs and go play with yourself on my bed?” The large sexy redhead moaned louder and then slowly retracted her wet fingers from her pussy, blinking. “Er… T-Ty? I’m just going to go upstairs and do this.” Ty nodded his approval, gave June a gentle rub on her back, and sent her off. She walked upstairs quickly and he saw her slip her fingers back inside herself when she got to the top and disappeared around the corner.<br />
<br />
“Now, then! Mark!” Ty said with an excited grin, heading back towards the living room. Was his little horsey pal still sleeping soundly? Ty walked slowly up to the couch and found Mark sleeping pleasantly in the same position he had left him, only with his strong equine arm dangling out. Ty grinned while he admired Mark’s quite handsome little horse snout. Ty reached out his index finger and brushed it against Mark’s nose repeatedly, petting his muzzle. The little horse man stirred and then groggily opened his eyes. Ty wrapped his whole hand around Mark’s chest, picking his warm little form up from the couch and placing the foot tall anthro in his other hand.  “Oh!” Mark said as his eyes went wide with shock, then he grinned and got comfortable in Ty’s palm. “Right. I forgot.” He smiled warmly, flicking his tail, and Ty smiled back with fondness.<br />
<br />
“Well, Ty?” Mark said casually, letting out a quick yawn. “What happens to me now? More pleasure, or something else?” Ty grinned, unexpectedly placing the tip of his finger on Mark’s sheath, making the animal almost flop forward and let out a gasp. “Ohhh!” Mark groaned deeply, “oh, God, it’s still so tender. I don’t think I can go again, Ty.” Ty laid down on the couch and snuggled the foot-tall Mark next to him, with Mark suddenly staring up at Ty’s gaze, which was locked firmly on his own. Ty smiled and gave Mark a pat on the head, prompting a content nicker from him. “I think,” Ty began, “that we’re going to change your mind around a little.” A confused Mark now looked a bit worried. “M-My mind? Why do you want to change my mind?” Ty began to stroke Mark’s chest, sifting through his thick fur and feeling the tight muscles underneath the animal hide. “Well,” Ty continued, “there’s no need to worry. Do you remember June, for a start?”<br />
<br />
Mark looked at Ty with a comically confused look now. “What? Your girlfriend June? Of course! I already knew you were going out with her long before you changed me into a little horse guy. What does that have to do with anything?” Ty nodded, confirming that he had indeed changed more than just June’s perception. “And Dustin?” Mark was flabbergasted, but Ty urged him to go on. “Uh,” Mark stammered, “Dustin is my adopted son. Just like you!” Ty grinned. That was all he needed. “Okay, Mark, I want you to clear your mind and relax.” Mark looked a bit dazed and then he let out a content sigh and laid back with his eyes closed and a grin on his snout. “Of course, Ty, I’ll do whatever you want me to.” The little Mark horse said softly, now under Ty’s influence.<br />
<br />
“Good, Mark. You were never a human being. You have always been a horse. I bought you from a breeder and raised you into an adult horse from a young foal, always taking great care of you, and when I found out I had my power I turned you into what you are now. I gave you the gift of sentience and a long human life.” Mark’s very history suddenly changed, and Ty noticed with amazement that all the pictures on the wall of the family and in particular Mark just vanished into thin air. He looked on in more amazement as a large framed portrait of Ty riding a handsome pinto horse that was clearly Mark appeared on the center wall of the room instead. Ty continued, being somewhat shocked he had just erased a person from existence and reconfigured his life on a whim. “You are my best and most devoted friend. You will do anything for June or me, but you will retain your own intelligence and will. You will become a totally new person based on what I’ve now made you.” Ty looked down in amazement at Mark, wondering if everything he had just said had really happened.<br />
<br />
Mark opened his eyes again and looked up at Ty with a huge grin. “Oh, Tyler,” he said gently, sounding very much like a different person than he had been just a few minutes ago. “I just want to thank you again for all you’ve done for me. To think, just a day ago I was a stupid animal.” The little horse sat up and nuzzled Ty’s cheek, almost in tears. “You’ve given me so much to look forward to. So much I can now experience in this new body. The change itself was so wonderful. You made it so sensual. But, may I ask you a question?” Ty nodded silently, now somewhat agape at the full realization he had the power to alter reality any way he liked. “Well,” Mark said almost shyly, “I don’t mean to sound unappreciative or anything, but why did you shrink me so small?”<br />
<br />
Ty smiled, coming up with a suitable answer for the brand new Mark. “Well, that’s easy. I-I had to get you inside the house as a fully-grown horse, didn’t I? And if you got scared or something nasty happened to you, I needed you at a size I could control easily, just in case.” Mark nodded, smiling back. “Yes, I thought so. That does make quite a lot of good sense.” Ty grinned, “you’re quite the inquisitive little thing, hey?” Mark nodded happily, now sitting with his legs folded up to his chest and his hands resting on his knees, his tail occasionally swishing from side to side as their dialogue continued. “Of course, Ty!” Mark said. “There’s still a lot about the world I don’t understand, but I’m sure with your guidance you can help me.” Ty nodded, deciding that he didn’t want to have his new friend tiny any longer. “How about I grow you nice and big, now that you’re all changed?” Mark whinnied excitedly. “Oh, you will?! Lovely! I don’t want to be so uselessly small like this forever, you know! There's stuff I want to do! Things I want to see! And I doubt it'll be easy at one foot tall.”<br />
<br />
The two of them hardly noticed the muffled cry of pleasure from upstairs as June continued to masturbate insatiably on Ty’s bed as she had been for the last twenty minutes.</p>
