<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sometime while laying on the bed Chris fell asleep. He awoke early but started his routine, his acting career <br />
demands that he stay in optimal physical fitness and several beers followed by immediate sleeping add to the <br />
flab.<br />
<br />
After working out, taking his protein shake and multitude of vitamins, showering, getting dressed, and <br />
grabbing his morning coffee Chris still had some time to kill. He decided to putz around online, maybe check <br />
friends statuses or the whatnot. Immediately, upon waking up the computer, it flashed a window saying &quot;You <br />
have 12:27:06 to confirm that you wish to save these changes, otherwise your settings will revert. Do you wish <br />
to save these changes?&quot; The timer was counting down 5..4..3..2.<br />
<br />
Initially Chris didn't know what changes the machine was talking about. All of a sudden, the memories came <br />
flooding back, both Chris's were fully aware of each other, what happened, and what the goal was. Chris <br />
staggered back as the room seemed to be spinning, he collapsed on his bed and passed out.<br />
<br />
Four minutes later he awoke and Chris was Chris. All the aspects of both personalities were there at the same <br />
time including all their memories and opinions, but they weren't separate anymore. Chris imagined his brother <br />
and could now easily recall all the memories he had with him both as a father and brother. <br />
<br />
The mental divide that had previously arisen when reality had shifted, broke down. Although there was still <br />
potential for mental conflict it was something he could deal with now that he understands the situation in <br />
full. <br />
<br />
Chris went back to the machine seeing that he still had 12 hours and 20 some odd minutes before the the <br />
changes would revert him and his father back to their former selves. He noticed the options:<br />
<br />
[ ] Revert Now<br />
[ ] Accept Changes<br />
[ ] Accept Changes But Save Original Profiles And New Profiles<br />
<br />
Wow, Chris thought. This machine is extremely user friendly. Then he remembered the multitude of popup boxes <br />
he played with last night that walked him through completely restructuring his reality, seemingly exactly how <br />
he wanted.<br />
<br />
Chris leaned back in his chair and thought about his life, it was an odd sensation to try to think about the <br />
mundane aspects of his life, and accept them as both completely true and completely false at the same time.<br />
<br />
Going over his life he took mental notes of the significant differences of how things played out and the <br />
experiences he previously didn't have, he also noted the mental changes the machine had made at his request <br />
and the effect they had as the story unfolded.<br />
<br />
As children, Mike and Chris were always close, the age gap was about a year so it wasn't much of an issue <br />
regarding Mike getting to do things where Chris couldn't. Usually Mike would raise an issue about curfew, <br />
bedtime, dating, or using the car and the restrictions were lifted for both of them or Chris got the new <br />
privilege a few months later after Mike had gotten a chance to enjoy it first.<br />
<br />
Mike and Chris had many of the same friends and high school was wonderful for them. One of the two boys always <br />
had a friend over so the other boy could almost always jump in if they were feeling social. Sometimes there <br />
were fights but the two of them usually forgot about it within hours, if not, it was settled by the next day.<br />
<br />
Chris remembered the parties he and Mike had thrown, and gone to. Chris was always the more outgoing of the <br />
two and he was always the one pulling stunts and getting wild. Chris remembered getting drunk at parties, <br />
having sex, trying pot, roofies, coke and other things because he always felt safe. His brother was there or <br />
would be if he needed him. He continued smoking pot and still does several times a week.<br />
<br />
Struck by the situation, Chris realized that in his original reality he never would have done most of those <br />
things. He wouldn't have had a brother to rely on and cover for him. so he wouldn't have ever tried anything <br />
that could be dangerous. He didn't have the circle of friends constantly coming into and out of the house, so <br />
he wouldn't have the opportunities current Chris did. <br />
<br />
But is his situation now, better than what it could have become if he just let himself grow up normally? Or <br />
even with the help of the machine? He was torn, his old self would have never have wanted this, but his <br />
current self loves his life. Undecided, Chris continued recounting the different aspects of his life.<br />
<br />
Mike got a job in his mid teens. Chris saw the nice things Mike could buy and quickly followed suit. They both <br />
carried jobs through high school and into college, Mike went for his 4yr degree but Chris stopped after his <br />
2yr degree. Chris loved art, music, drama, and worked out so he could keep his options open. Several times he <br />
was a clothing model for a catalog doing full body shots of outfits, a few times for swimwear and underwear. <br />
<br />
His mind flipped to the present and he took pride in the 1 year contract he recently got last month. He is <br />
working his way up from unsteady picture deals to a contracted acting career! He was the lead male role in a <br />
full length film being put on by a small studio in a town relatively close. Its a porno and the writing is <br />
crappy but he gets to speak and then have sex numerous times a day, and he gets paid for it!<br />
<br />
Here different trains of thought went rampant. Old Chris wouldn't ever resort to doing a porno, he wanted to <br />
do Hollywood dramas and action movies where he could bring the characters to life. New Chris is so very much <br />
more outgoing and proud of his accomplishments, his body is built to do porn. Everything including his <br />
personality, physique, stamina, cock size and interest in being on film make this the perfect fit for him.<br />
<br />
Well, not everything. Chris pondered for a moment, one thing could make everything better...<br />
<br />
Leaning forward Chris minimized the popup and went into the settings for himself, he switched sexual <br />
preference from straight to bi and increased his sexual interest from very high to extreme. Finally he went <br />
into the knowledge section and deleted ever knowing he was, at one point, Mike's son. He kept knowledge of the <br />
device and moved the mouse over the GO button. Waiting, undecided.<br />
<br />
The popup he minimized came back up by itself and the computer beeped at him, letting him know he needs to address that <br />
first. His mouse hovered over the Revert Now button...<br />
<br />
Chris sat there pondering his options. His contract took a hefty hit because he refused to do anything with <br />
men sexually. For Chris, the thought of doing anything sexual with a man was a huge turn off. He has no ill will <br />
towards people who like that but he simply cant perform sexual acts to another man. Even receiving oral from a man <br />
turns him off. He experimented and tried to like it. He wished he was bisexual because it would have meant another 10k <br />
in his contract. If he changes his orientation to bi, he could go to his boss to get his contract updated, make more <br />
money, and give himself more options in the future.<br />
<br />
Or, he could respect who he was. In realizing that this was wildly out of sorts from where it was supposed to <br />
go, he could go back to a lame 16 year old and try again. Maybe not making such a life altering change with so <br />
many variables. He could recreate his life piece by piece through smaller changes, and chalk this up to over <br />
excitement with a new toy. <br />
<br />
Or, he thought, maybe he didn't go far enough? Chris has a relatively unstable future because he was never <br />
self reliant and never had anyone relying on him. People usually expected things from his older brother. Chris <br />
would jump in and help but it was always his brother's responsibility, his brother's success or failure... <br />
Maybe if Chris were the older brother... or maybe Chris could go back to 16 so he could make Mike his 6 year old and <br />
Chris would be his 27 year old father? After going back, Mike's parenting memories would be restored and Chris could <br />
use them as his own...<br />
<br />
What to do? He has to head to work in the next 20 or so minutes. Chris <br />
works a full 8 hour shift and gets an hour for lunch (more so for penile recovery). So that's 9 hours. His <br />
drive takes about 40 minutes there and an hour back (rush hour traffic). So thats 10 hours and 40 minutes from <br />
when I leave to when I return, and we have 20 minutes till I leave, so 11 hours from now I'll be getting home! <br />
<br />
The timer was still counting down, 11 hours 25 minutes until changes automatically reverse. Chris wants to make a <br />
decision now. What to do? Technically, he could wait till he gets home but he may get caught in traffic and not make it <br />
Home before things revert back, Or while Chris is gone, Mike might try to check his email just like Chris did... that <br />
could make things really awkward.</p>
