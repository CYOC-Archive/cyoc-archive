<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly, but with an ever continuing longing I began to think in goatish terms, taking to grazing on green grass there outside the gates leading one to the Back to Cedius, Rachel, and the bandy bunch of satyrs.<br />
<br />
Strange when I think back to those days, of how at ease with the world I felt. The only real remembrance that bothers me yet, was when the Park attendants from &quot;Animal Husbandry&quot; snared me by the neck and dragged me into a truck stuffed full of partial or fully, like me, changed and changing people becoming soon as an animal.<br />
<br />
Inside the truck bay I found some who wanted nothing to do with me; while from in the throng of partially changed people came two girls, they attended to me as had Rachel.<br />
<br />
What made me as I stood there, that sweet but damning wine of Pan the satyr men did offer and of which I drank; its changing ability remained in me but blended into my semen, urine, and the manure I allowed to drop from a hairy rump.<br />
<br />
Two horny females did toy, suckle, and drink my seed. They as had I became more like me, and by continuing to urge me into orgasm after climax, each made of their self a nanny goat.<br />
<br />
Those others in the truck that retained some of their bodily form, with human wits and rational thinking, sat amazed and appalled.<br />
<br />
I remember this one man, seemingly an older person than of all the young men and some girls that foolishly came to the Isle of Pleasure Island.<br />
<br />
One pair of eyes did take aim and watching me as I stood allowing the young women to suckle and later as I mounted them, humping them, and granting to them what I was and felt as something being very comfortable.<br />
<br />
I remember him, that man and he setting off to one side of the truck bay, close to the open slats and some passing fresh air.<br />
<br />
He had large dark orbs of eyes, and a face half changed to that of a brown furry donkey. His mealy gray muzzle stood out in the dim light of that busy but dank and dark truck bay. He often licked his lips, as if they were very dry or if he seeing me, did want for something I had for him to drink.<br />
<br />
Whatever, he like the others and as days before that so had I, this man was feeling the changing of a human body to become soon as some larger breed of donkey than were the younger boys.<br />
<br />
I get hard just thinking of as I watched him and he changing into his final form of becoming what I heard of later, an Andalusian Mammoth Jack donkey stud; while I rutted one of my changing women, the thought of him and how he as such a bigger animal would know and have a greater amount of pleasure from his animalistic life.<br />
<br />
Jealousy of bestial lifestyle did well up inside of me. The new force of deep feeling emotions that in time I came to realize as the dooming factor which kept those changed to be animals, as remaining then as animals.<br />
<br />
Some few luck men met with Veterinaries, became then neutered and with early on loosing of their bigger balls, found that without a hefty and constant flow of testosterone, the being as an animal did wane and allowed them to return again to a human form.<br />
<br />
Others went on to become as brute beasts and lusted constantly for more and many sexual conquests. It was of these the Park and their Animal Husbandry department made a fine profit. <br />
<br />
Once the mind had fully accepted and allowed the animalistic body to function as some bold and passionate breeder sire, the human mind, will, and rationale were lost; it was of these many who continue to  live on as animals, being jealous of each and the others like their kinds.<br />
<br />
Oddly, and fortunate for me the sexual sense of passion seemed to fade and I again returned to living a passion free life of simple grazing and feeling sated.<br />
<br />
Slowly, as from months and years of acting like I were some elderly big buck, my humanity returned, making of me a satyr, and then on to becoming human like but not as of my original face and weak bodily form.<br />
<br />
As I changed to being a satyr, the management saw in me a good choice as a sheep and goat herder. A Shepard of the fields, I tended the animals and felt still no need or want to bare myself into any of them.<br />
<br />
Times passed and with it I became again a very stout and heartily strong form of a man, something like a virile Paul Bunyan, standing 6'7&quot; tall, a chest girth of 54 inches, and my forearms, arms and legs with tight hard muscular strength equal to having once been as an animal.<br />
<br />
Although having returned to be a part of humanity, those there at the farm where I matured again saw me as something they feared to allow me my freedom and leave the farm.<br />
<br />
Saddened at first, I gave it some consideration and thought, realizing that not one of those I held dear as family could or would recognize me as ever being a part of that family unit. As longings passed into forgotten delights, I faced up to being a hearty big farmhand.<br />
<br />
In time those there in management thought enough of me and trusted me to ride the retrieval truck into the Park, helping to snare loose wanderers, and gather in changed and those still changing.<br />
<br />
The truck driver, my boss as such, told me of many he had captured, some as females did try to offer him a romp. He warned me to these alluring and extra-sensual females, reminding me that they could infect me and if done I would again return to being as an animal but like them it would be quite permanent.   <br />
<br />
My daily work and the sorted sense of new freedom granted to me still brought me to hate my life and what I dealt with as one working in animal husbandry.<br />
<br />
Happenstance had me sent to work for a week at the Donkey, Mule, stud farm, where there I discovered Tyler, a hearty huge stud of an Andalusian Mammoth Jack Donkey, he hard at work. This big Jack was the older man I saw there in that truck on my fated night of being captured.  <br />
<br />
Tyler knew of me as when I was a fully formed big buck of a mating goat; and not what I later became as regaining my link to humanity.<br />
<br />
I would talk with him, he still retaining some inklings of what he was once, and with remembering of me, Tyler seeing me after that would show his delight by getting a massive big erection.<br />
<br />
Tyler had me as when I was then a buck goat feeling a sense of jealousy; he endowed with such a long and huge big cock, it still turned me on with seeing it.<br />
<br />
Management took note of my befriending of Tyler, they stepping up his numbers of mares to mate and make from them more mules. Tyler found his maleness in dire need by many a jennet donkey, to which he showed all there how he could excel at mating and still return to being calm and able to communicate.<br />
<br />
Unable to speak through those thick and rubbery donkey lips, Tyler did with some showing by me, he regained learned knowledge and wrote with a fore hoof in the sand of his corral.A southpaw, being left handed in human times, as a Mammoth donkey he grasped then at what he knew when human, dragging information from the right side of a degraded brain.<br />
<br />
He wrote and I spoke, my conversing with Tyler led me to nearly doing as had those women in the truck to me when standing as a virile buck goat.<br />
<br />
As from that aroused erection Tyler would greet me whenever we would meet; I felt an urge to kneel and suckle on it, knowing that the poisons blended into his huge equine testicles would then make of me another like him.</p>
