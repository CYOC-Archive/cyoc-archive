<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking a breath, Jeff now knocked on Mrs. Evans door, a muffled voice answering and asking for him to come in. Entering Mrs. Evans office, Jeff noted a warm smile on her face as she beckoned Jeff to take a seat. &quot;So how was your Spring Break?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Jeff shrugged glancing up at the clock. &quot;Um is there something I can help you with Mrs. Evans? The bell is about to ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Jeff,&quot; she smiled, Jeff now watched as the assistant principal made a quick phone call before sprawling out a pass. &quot;Their,&quot; she said. &quot;That pass will keep you from catching a tardy plus I let your homeroom teacher know you were in my office. I wanted to talk with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff uttered a thank you, knowing he would have the next hour to do as he pleased. A million thoughts raced through his head as to what he should do. Firstly though he wanted to know what Mrs. Evans wanted. &quot;Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is fine Jeff,&quot; she said. &quot;In fact I wanted to commend you. I&#39;ve been watching how you deal with your brothers and their friends. You&#39;ve really made a positive impact on them and the paper you wrote? I just started it but I&#39;m impressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mrs. Evans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you thought about becoming a teacher,&quot; she asked. &quot;You have a gift when it comes to influencing young kids in a positive way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff paused, he hadn&#39;t really thought about what to do after graduation. He still had another year plus of high school. As he thought about his future, Mrs. Evans continued to talk, her last sentence regaining Jeffs full attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I wish I had known someone like you when I was your brothers age,&quot; she mused. &quot;I think I could avoided alot of mistakes if I had a mentor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You made mistakes,&quot; Jeff asked, drawing a chuckle from the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone makes mistakes,&quot; she said. &quot;And as you grow older you do have regrets. Yeah I&#39;ve had a pretty good career. I&#39;ve had a pretty good life. Sometimes though, kind of wish I could be young again. You know, not have all those adult worries.&quot; Mrs. Evans paused, blushing slightly. &quot;Sorry about that just thinking out loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s okay,&quot; Jeff stated. &quot;I get it. Whats that saying, youth is wasted on the young?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Evans laughed, Jeff noticing her blue eyes sparkle as she nodded. Jeff now tried to hide his grin as he thought. After regressing so many adults into childhood, he wanted to try something a little different. &quot;What if I told you that I could give you your youth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Id say that would be a neat trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not a trick Mrs. Evans,&quot; Jeff stated. &quot;If you wish it I can make you young. Even if its just for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought of you as the creative type Mr. Davis,&quot; she said. &quot;But I suppose I can humor you.&quot; Jeff smirked, taking out his phone and bringing up the Chronovac. Tapping in Mrs. Evans, he now showed the assistant principal her stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Cheyenne Evans<br />
Age: 52<br />
Mental Age: 52<br />
Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: 164 lbs<br />
Hair: blonde <br />
Eyes: blue<br />
Gender: female<br />
<br />
&quot;How were you able to do that,&quot; Mrs. Evans asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Chronovac scans a person&#39;s statistics,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;After that I can alter their statistics. Watch as I alter your age.&quot; Mrs. Evans nodded, watching as Jeff now tapped his phone a few times before showing Mrs. Evans his work.<br />
<br />
Name: Cheyenne Evans<br />
Age: 5<br />
Mental Age: 5 (delayed reaction)<br />
Height: auto <br />
Weight: auto<br />
Hair: blonde <br />
Eyes: blue<br />
Gender: female <br />
Alter clothes: yes (delayed)<br />
Alter reality: yes <br />
Activate changes? Yes/No<br />
<br />
Mrs. Evans eyes grew wide as she looked between the Chronovac and Jeff. &quot;You&#39;re going to make me five,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Why five?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Artie thought you were pretty,&quot; Jeff smirked, eliciting a laugh from Mrs. Evans. &quot;So what do you say? Feel like reliving kindergarten?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Evans bit her lip, thinking this was some sort of gag. It wasn&#39;t possible that a simple app on a cellphone could change people. Still, part of her wanted it to be true but to be five years old again seemed a bit extreme. What would happen to her if she were reduced to a young child once again? Slowly she now reached out, gently touching the button to activate the Chronovac. &quot;So what happens now,&quot; she asked anxiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Cheyenne,&quot; Jeff smirked. &quot;Now you start getting younger. By the way I left the awareness option on. I want to hear your opinion on things as you grow younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just call me Cheyenne,&quot; she asked, feeling a bit indignant at being addressed by her first name. &quot;I&#39;m still the assistant principal Mr. Davis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for much longer take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne paused, casting Jeff an odd look. Slowly she now withdrew a mirror from her purse, gasping as she saw her face. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; she gasped. &quot;I look.....younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne now stood, quickly making her way towards a larger mirror in her office. Glancing at it the woman was stunned by what she saw. She looked to be in her mid forties once again, the small stray greys vanishing as the small creases around her eyes began to smooth. A small laugh now escaping her lips as she watched her hair brighten while her figure firmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible,&quot; the now 40 year old whispered. &quot;I think I&#39;m almost back in my thirties!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, admiring the womans figure. Cheyenne had a firm figure with a flat stomach, ample curves and CC cups breasts. As she retreated through her thirties, Jeff marveled at the beauty before her, still Cheyenne was in for a shock in a moment. &quot;How old were you when you became assistant principal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty eight why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned, motioning towards the nameplate on her desk. Cheyenne now looked at where Jeff was pointing, gasping as she saw it changed. &quot;My names gone,&quot; she gasped. Cheyenne now picked the plate up, furrowing her brow as she looked at the new name. &quot;Alex Stewart,&quot; she said. &quot;Mr. Stewart is the new Assistant Principal how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too young to be the assistant principal now,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;You look about 30 now. What can you tell me about Mr. Stewart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes been trying to become the assistant principal,&quot; she said. &quot;I talked with him recently, he said he probably will have an assistant principal job next year.&quot; Cheyenne gazed in awe atbthe name plate, rubbing her finger along the name as she pondered what had happened. &quot;If he&#39;s the assistant principal then what am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A teacher,&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;But probably not for much longer. I think you&#39;re back in your twenties now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne gasped, glancing over herself before studying her appearance in the mirror. Cheyenne&#39;s face was now smooth and unlined, her body trim with firm breasts and an admittedly cute ass. She was back in her prime now, her late twenties when she turned heads everytime she entered the room. Cheyenne knew she was attra time, yet she wanted to be appreciated for her skill not her looks. It had taken her a longtime to reconcile that fact and be appreciated for her intelligence and work ethic.<br />
<br />
Now though her prime was beginning to look like something that was to be anticipated as opposed to something she had lived through. Cheyenne continued to race through her twenties, edging closer to her college days. Jeff noting her face rounding slightly, her body continuing to thin. &quot;Quick question Cheyenne,&quot; Jeff smirked. &quot;Do you have a teacher ID?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne frowned, about to lecture Jeff before digging into her purse and producing her school identification. Holding it up, she noted a bemused amirk cross Jeffs face, the young teacher now glancing at it before gasping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Student teacher,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Oh my God! I can&#39;t be more than what? 23? 24?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds about right Miss C,&quot; Jeff said with a smile. &quot;Although Cheyenne seems more appropriate now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne now glanced  at herself once more, her blue eyes growing wide as she gazed at the girl in the mirror. The blonde woman&#39;s face was so young looking now, appearing as if she still had a year to graduate from college. Cheyenne&#39;s blond hair fell in thick golden tresses, spilling halfway down her back as her eyes sparkled with youthful energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just out of curiosity Cheyenne are you old enough to buy alcohol?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne frowned, casting a surly look at Jeff. Quickly reaching for her license, Cheyenne gasped as she watched a series of red letters now appear on her license. &quot;Under 21,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Oh God I&#39;m only 20!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded watching as the pretty young coed retreat further back in college. The now 19 year olds curves beginning to melt away, the Freshmen fifteen wiped away leaving an attractive 18 year old High Schooler who Jeff imagined was every boys secret crush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Cheyenne,&quot; Jeff said in awe. &quot;You sure were cute in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne blushed, casting a nervous glance at Jeff before looking at herself. The 18 year old was astonished at her changes, her face now becoming more innocent, her waist becoming thinner forcing her to hike her slacks up, even her heels felt a little looser. Looking at Jeff it frightened her slightly that Jeff didn&#39;t appear so young anymore, now he looked like her peer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um thanks Jeff,&quot; she stammered. Cheyenne paused, clearing her throat as she looked to Jeff. &quot;How old am I now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seventeen,&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;No wait sixteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne squeaked, the pretty blond teen gasping in shock as her clothes bellowed around her. She had just relived a late growth spurt in reverse, shrinking down an inch as her clothing continued to grow on her. The now 16 year old teen glancing at Jeff as she stumbled in her slightly oversized heels.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I just shrunk,&quot; she whispered, &quot;And these shoes are starting to be a pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne now sat across from Jeff, her cheeks blushing slightly as she looked at the teen. For a moment the two were the same age, Cheyenne realizing she would probably have a crush on him if she was a teen. Jeff now reached down, gently picking up Cheyennes feet before removing her shoes, exposing her now much smaller feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um thanks,&quot; Cheyenne stammered, the teen shrinking down from 16 to 15. &quot;They were starting to get a bit annoying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, holding the girls shrinking feet in his hands. Both teens now watched as Cheyenne continued to grow younger, her feet shrinking ever so slightly as the hem of her pants crept over her ankles. On a whim, Jeff now tickled her foot eliciting a girlish squeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that,&quot; she squealed, leaping to her feet. &quot;I&#39;m ticklish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff now stood, chuckling softly as he looked into Cheyenne&#39;s eyes. The pretty blonde teen couldn&#39;t be more than 14 now, appearing like a waifish girl who was just starting her high school career. Cheyenne gulped, gripping her slacks tightly as puberty began to reverse itself, the girls breasts slowly but steadily melting back into her chest as she grew younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me,&quot; the preteen whispered, watching her hands grow smaller as her breasts became a pair of softball sized mounds. &quot;I can&#39;t be more than 12 now! Im....I&#39;m...just a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, Cheyenne taking a breath as she scooted back onto her chair. The girls eyes now growing wide, watching as her feet slowly began to lift off the floor, vanishing into her pant legs. Cheyenne now extended her arms out, giggling as she noticed her blouse completely covering her hands. The material extending several inches pat them and growing with each passing moment. It was surreal for the girl, Cheyenne feeling as if she was swimming in her adult clothing.<br />
<br />
Jeff now watched as the regression competed itself. Cheyenne clinging to her blouse as she giggled at the ridiculousness of her situation. She was five years old with her adult mind and clothing. &quot;Can I have some clothes that fit,&quot; she asked in between giggles.<br />
<br />
Cheyenne gasped, watching her clothing ahift around her as soon as the words left her mouth. Cheyenne&#39;s slacks shrinking, becoming a pair of jeggings as her blouse transformed into a frilly emerald green dress shirt. Glancing at her discarded heels, Cheyenne watched as they transformed into a pair of sneakers with socks. The little girl hopping out of her chair as she began to put them on.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible Jeff,&quot; she said in astonishment. &quot;I can&#39;t believe that worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to have a blast,&quot; Cheyenne said happily. &quot;I mean its kindergarten the work isn&#39;t going to be that hard. I&#39;m just going to relax and play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you will Cheyenne,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;You just won&#39;t remember being an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheyenne paused, what did Jeff mean by that. As she went ask she paused, her mind catching up with her physical regression. Years of knowledge and experience emptying out of her mind leaving her an innocent young kindergartener. Jeff now approached the girl with a warm smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Cheyenne let&#39;s hurry you don&#39;t want to be any later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kay,&quot; Cheyenne said, the little girl taking Jeffs hand as he led her to her class. Jeff now watching as Cheyenne approached Artie the two children exchanging a shy smile as they began to play. Jeff smiled, heading back towards the high school area as he thought about what to do with the rest of his day.</p>
