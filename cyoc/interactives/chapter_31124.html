<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You pull up your pant leg so you can keep an eye on your leg as you walk. When you pull your pant leg up, you realize the change has been creeping up your leg slowly, because you see about 1/16th of an inch of fur past your sock, you try to stay calm, so you don't do anything that could raise your heart rate and increase blood flow, and you decide to tie one on your other leg, so if it does get that far, it wont change your leg, you also rip the other sock in half, and wrap it around the top of each arm, and you set your belt as tight around your stomach as you can, and still be able to breath enough.<br />
<br />
You continue to walk slowly, looking for someone or something to help you, and you step on something that feels squishy under your rabbit foot, and you look down and scream &quot;OW!&quot; when something bites you. You were scared, you didn't know what had bitten you, and you didn't want to change anymore. Your foot feels very dry, and your rabbit fur is coming out, you think, &quot;Maybe it was the cure!&quot; but soon realize it isn't, because scales start forming on your skin where the fur came out, and pretty soon, your leg is still the shape of a rabbits foot, but it is covered in scales instead of fur, and you still have pink paw pad, but they are dirty.<br />
<br />
You get worried and pass out from trying to breathe too hard, and having a belt around your stomach. When you wake up an hour later, you have a hard time breathing, and decide to tie the belt as tightly around your waist as you can, so it doesn't happen again, and so you get up after the hour rest from passing out, and continue walking.<br />
<br />
After walking for 3 or so hours, you finally find your way home, and you take off your long pants, and shirt, and are only in your underwear, so that you can keep an eye on the change a little better. You get your camera, and take a picture of your self, and upload it to your computer, you decided you would create a journal about what is happening to your body.<br />
<br />
The next day, you call in sick from work, and tell them you won't be coming for a while because you are really sick. After you hung up the phone, you realized you were glad your boss didn't ask what was wrong, because you hadn't thought of something good to say. You also relieved the socks from your arms, and your still human leg, so they could get some blood. You took off the belt the day before, because you realized it wouldn't do anything. Plus, not getting blood flow to your rabbit/snake leg made it get really cold, so you always had a heating pad wrapped around it.<br />
<br />
You took another picture of your leg, and noted it had spread up about another half an inch. After 20 hours of your leg being like this, you weren't so freaked anymore, but you were worried about a rat or something getting into your house, and biting you, because you didn't want anything else to happen to you, it was weird enough already.<br />
<br />
The next few days were uneventful, you were careful not to let people see you when you checked your mail, and you were lucky, because just a week ago, before your leg changed, you stocked up on canned food, but you don't know what you are going to do when you run out.<br />
<br />
A little later that day, you noticed your paw pads were really dirty, so you left your leg sitting in warm water for the rest of the day, and night. The next day, you noticed the scales getting close to your middle of your calf, you decided to get some rope, and make the knot at the sock tighter, and you also decided to tie rope at the top and middle of your calf, so the change is slower, and hopefully won't go any further if you can make the knot tight enough.<br />
<br />
After about a week, you notice it has stopped where you tied the rope around the middle of your calf, but the rope is uncomfortable, but if you take it off, the change will keep going. <br />
<br />
After sitting in your house for a month, the change managed to progress half an inch past the middle rope, and you were running out of things to do for entertainment. TV got boring, video games got boring, and so did eating, and exercising. You decided you could exercise your imagination; you tried to figure out, and draw what you would look like if the change completely happened, and if something else bit you.<br />
<br />
After another day or so, you began to run low on food, you only had enough for 4 days, and so you had to go to the store, but how would you go without letting people see your elongated foot? &quot;I know!&quot; You exclaimed to noone in particular. You could order food online, and the job you had before got you enough money to retire 20 years ago, so you could live life leisurely except for the cramps you sometimes get from your slowly changing body.<br />
<br />
You wondered about having to go outside and signing that you received a package, since online food services always seem to require that. At least you wont have to check the fruit you buy from them, because they make sure it is good before they ship it.<br />
<br />
You make an order, but you don't buy many fresh items such as fruit, because you want to minimize how many times you go outside, because fresh fruit would go bad faster than canned soups for example. You find a large drench coat in your closet, and you keep your leg wrapped in the warming pad, and look yourself over in a full body mirror. Your foot is disguised well enough; someone might think you broke your foot or something because you are limping, trying to hide the foot.<br />
<br />
The next day, your food arrives; the total came out to $452.21 for 2 months of food, and shipping costs. You put it all away in the cabinets, and go rest for a bit after lugging 450 dollars of groceries into the house.<br />
<br />
Another month goes by, and you get fed up with your computer, you need to get a new one before the old one dies, so you can keep ordering food online, and continue your journal on your change. You have to get a new one fast, because you need to stay in your house, and use the Internet to order one.<br />
<br />
In 2 days when your new computer arrives, your neighbor asks why she never sees you out any more, and why you are limping. You reply, &quot;I retired, and I broke my ankle, but I'm fine,&quot; and she tries to be a friendly neighbor and talk, so you talk with her for a little, she invites you to sit, and take off the drench coat, because it is hot outside, and you almost forgot about hiding your foot, because you almost said ok.<br />
<br />
You are setting up your computer the minute you got it in the door, feeling the excitement of getting a new thing that costs a lot. You turn on the computer. A welcome screen shows up, and it asks you for information, such as the time, and what you want your use name to be, you decided to make it scaly rabbit based on your foot. It also asked if you wanted free AOL service, but you said no, because you already have high speed internet from Comcast.<br />
<br />
Once your computer is set up, you transfer the data from your old computer to your new one, and your desktop is finally clean, and your cords behind your computer aren't all tangled, you also have a 32 bit graphics card, a 17&quot; 1280x1024 flat screen monitor, a 32 bit sound card, speakers, and two 200 gig hard drives, all of which you didn't have with your old computer. plus, this computer is much faster than the old one.<br />
<br />
Now that you have a new computer that runs Windows instead of Dos, and is much more powerful, you decide to order some games online, which provides much more entertainment for a long while, so you can keep yourself sane, while cooped up in your house.<br />
<br />
After about 4 years, your other leg has changed in just the same way as the first one did, and another 5 years, and it has risen up your chest and back, and about to go onto your arms, so you decide to tie some ropes around your arms. <br />
<br />
You notice that you are very tired, and you need some sleep, so you go to lie down on your bed, and ponder the last 7.5 years of your life. You then realize, what will I do when my head changes? it seems like that will happen last, so you aren't very worried just yet, but you want to figure out something as soon as you can. You also need to figure out something about your hands, what if your hands turn completly into paws when it reaches them? how would you grab things? You figure, that if you keep all of your fingers and 2 thumbs, you could wear gloves.<br />
<br />
In another 2 and a half years, everything below your neck has changed, and you have removed the ropes from your arms, because they will do no good anymore. You kept your basic hand, except, scales, small claws, paw pads on the end of each finger and thumb, and a bigger one on your palm, you figured this was ok where it was, and you were glad it stopped there.<br />
<br />
Now came the hard part, you had to keep your head hidden. After thinking about it for a few minutes, you decided to get some of that mesh that hides a persons face, but the person can see thru it, which is sometimes used in costumes. you have a hood on the coat, and hopefully your ears, when they grow, will be able to drape down comfortably.<br />
<br />
You decide to remove the rest of the ropes from your leg, and get the change finished, and you stick your face in a pillow for when you scream in pain from your skull reforming. you wait a couple seconds, ans you feel scales growing on your neck, and once they reach your head, the pain comes, as your skull reforms to create a rabbits muzzle, and teeth like a rabbit, The ears growing wasn't nearly as painful as your skull shifting.<br />
<br />
You look in the mirror, your head is covered in scales, you have a pink nose, long drapy ears, and snake eyes, you got freaked by the snake eyes, but then remembered the snake biting you.<br />
<br />
Your face is sore for the next week from your skull changing, but other than that, you are just fine.</p>
