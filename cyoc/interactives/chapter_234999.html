<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff heard the front door open and close, followed by a ping from the Chronivac on the computer. Jeff looked at the computer and saw that a new profile had appeared as a potential subject, his older brother David, who was 18 and a senior in High School. David was a star soccer player with a few offers from colleges already that he&#39;d yet to have decided between yet, and he was likely home to quick change for practice before heading back out. Any more he was rarely home as he was either at school, at practice, out with his friends or girlfriend, Laura. He also remembered being treated by David--until relatively recently--as the annoying little brother by him. The one who was a bit of embarrassment when it came to lacking much in the way of athleticism.<br />
<br />
Jeff wondered what David would be like if the roles were reversed, and David were the little brother to Jeff being the older brother.<br />
<br />
Well, why not find out?<br />

<br />
Jeff hit enter and decided he wanted to watch this transformation as much as possible. And so Jeff got up from the computer as the timer that appeared began to count down. Jeff knocked on David&#39;s door before being told he could enter. Jeff entered his brother&#39;s room to find incense burning to try and cover the smell of the dirty sweated through clothes in his hamper. David himself still looked like the big brother Jeff knew, though dressed in gym shorts and his team jersey. It looked like Jeff had interrupted while David was busy looking for his soccer socks and shin guards that went underneath them. He was barefoot otherwise, with his soccer cleats tied together by their laces and hanging around David&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up Jeff?&quot; asked David as he returned to the bed and picked up the shin guard laying there before. It might have been Jeff&#39;s imagination, but David looked a little thinner, less built out, and more langy, and his face looked slightly rounder to Jeff&#39;s observations. His thoughts were confirmed when Jeff watched as the shin guard shrunk right in David&#39;s hand, and so did the muscle on the leg he attached it to. If Jeff had to guess, David looked more like a twin brother, than an older brother at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, just wanted to wish you luck before practice and your scrimage later tonight,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thaaanks Jeff,&quot; said David, his voice cracking slightly, something Jeff only vaguely remembered happening a few years ago.<br />
<br />
The changes in David now became far more noticeable as not only did his face look rounder and more like a cute boyish face, but David&#39;s hands and feet were starting to look somewhat out of proportion with the rest of his body--something his attempt to put on his sock over his large feet with shrinking legs, he looked rather comical.<br />
<br />
David was definitely younger than Jeff now, and from the looks of it quickly exiting puberty in the opposite direction as the team logo on the front of the jersey transformed from something more respectable like a fighting wasp to a more child-friendly bumble bee. His height was now definitely shorter than Jeff&#39;s, and David was certainly a little brother to Jeff now, but the changes were not yet finished.<br />
<br />
With the last bit of the transformation completed, David&#39;s oversized feet and hands shrunk to more proportional sizes befitting a young twelve year old boy, along with his height definitely shrinking a few inches. Jeff now saw his brother that he remembered from 6 years prior, only now instead of looking up at him, he was looking down as he pulled his socks up his legs and over his shin guards.<br />
<br />
The room surrounding David--no, Davey and Jeff shifted as well. Photos of David with his friends and girlfriend vanished or altered to photos of David with new friends. Ribbons, medals, and trophies David had won from his dedication to high school athleticism disappeared entirely. More childish adornments appeared, a leftover Pokemon poster here, an old Lego Movie poster there, and so on. Soon, David was sitting in a perfect recreation of what his room looked like when Davey really was 12 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to go!&quot; announced Davey, whose voice had definitely returned to that of a little boy&#39;s voice. His brother looked expectantly at him, and Jeff soon realized that Davey was expecting him to say something, and it was about then that a fuzzy memory of promising his mother this morning to drive Davey to soccer practice popped up in his memory right before she hurried out the door for work.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed at his keys in his pocket as Davey stuffed his feet into crocs to wear until they got to the field for him to put his cleats on.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, let&#39;s head out,&quot; said Jeff as he ushered his new little brother out of his room and down to the beat up old junker that had been David&#39;s car, but now was Jeff&#39;s--with Jeff only having just recently gotten his license--something that he hadn&#39;t had before as he&#39;d relied on David&#39;s driving him to school for the past two years.<br />
<br />
It was weird driving Davey to soccer practice. At once it felt like he&#39;d been doing so for a little while now, but at the same time, it felt completely new. And that weird feeling of deja vu mixed with inexperience continued after they got to the pitch. Davey had barely settled onto the bleachers to change his shoes than Jeff realized he was one of the only teenagers there compared to the flock of parents who occupied the bleachers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, I saved you a seat!&quot; called a voice he recognized, and quickly Jeff found himself staring right at Claire Woods. A vague memory of Claire driving her own little brother, Mike, Davey&#39;s best friend, popped into his head, and how Claire and Jeff had been enjoying each other&#39;s company being two of the only teenagers here with nothing better to do than take their little brothers to soccer practice. Claire had a pile of school books next to her that she quickly switched to the other side of her, allowing Jeff to slide in next to Claire. As Jeff recalled from his memory before the change--Claire Woods had always been a bit of a bookworm and an honor roll student. Something easy to achieve if you need to kill time watching your little brother practice all the time. Before David&#39;s transformation he had been friendly with her, but not friends in the strictest sense of the term, apparently that was an unintentional change from all of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was starting to worry that you and Davey weren&#39;t coming,&quot; said Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nahh, Davey just took his time getting ready today,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
Claire then launched into a chat with Jeff as though they were picking up from some earlier conversation which Jeff at first found difficult to follow until vague memories started cropping up in his mind that eventually made talking with Claire feel easy, natural, and second nature. Before he knew it, practice was over and Davey and Mike were back over at the bleachers, cleats already off and crocs already on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Jeff, do you wanna, hang out sometime without our annoying little brothers tagging along?&quot; suggested Claire boldly, but with a slight hint of hesitancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, name the time and place, and let&#39;s go--my treat,&quot; said Jeff as casually as he might any friend, though there was a certain undertone to the conversation he was getting from Claire which made him think she was testing the waters with him, and Jeff was amenable to seeing where things might go--no need to pressure anything, Claire was kinda cute in her own way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I&#39;ll text you,&quot; said Claire before grabbing the stunned looking Mike and heading off towards the cars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you dating Claire?&quot; asked Davey with a tone that Jeff recognized was on the verge of turning into a &quot;Jeff and Claire sitting in the tree&quot; rhyme. Jeff cut that off right at the pass with a &quot;Sometimes I wanna hang out without my little brother as chaperone, thanks,&quot; before they headed back to the old junker.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does chaperone mean?&quot; asked Davey once they got to the car.<br />
<br />
Jeff was stunned at first--this was the first time David had ever asked him what something meant. He recalled the reverse many times growing up, but now his memories were getting fuzzy as he recalled Davey constantly asking him what such and such meant and so forth. Trying to put it into terms that Davey would understand, Jeff said, &quot;It&#39;s kinda like a babysitter, or a killjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, as your babysitter? Guess that makes you the baby,&quot; teased Davey with a laugh. Jeff felt such a tease couldn&#39;t go without some sort of response, so he leaned over, grabbed Davey about his skinny shoulders and rubbed his knuckles against Davey&#39;s scalp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can a baby give you a noogie?&quot; asked Jeff, not putting much pressure into the rub.<br />
<br />
Davey laughed and squirmed, but Jeff held tight until Davey called &quot;uncle!&quot; which was the unexplained rules that even Jeff recognized.<br />
<br />
Jeff drove his little brother home, feeling rather contented at the change in birth order had brought him: a closer relationship with his brother, a potential girl interested in him, and a license with an old junker of a car that was his. All in all, it wasn&#39;t bad to be the older brother at all.</p>
