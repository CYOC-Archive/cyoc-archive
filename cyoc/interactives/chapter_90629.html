<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s POV<br />
<br />
I&#39;m gay. Mike did something to me, switched bodies with me and now I&#39;m gay. I can&#39;t believe it.<br />
<br />
I went home. I was lost in my thoughts the entire way home and wound up at Mike&#39;s house. How did I even know where Mike lived? I drove past it to look for my home but didn&#39;t have a clear idea where my home was. I had a clear knowledge of where Mike lived by I only had a vague idea where I lived.<br />
<br />
I drove into the city to the bar we usually hang out at. Most of the team was there and they told me that Jeff had just left. I looked around at the women and not one of them interested me but I saw a few men that interested me. I didn&#39;t stay at the bar.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t know where I was headed. I just drove for a while. As long as I was alone, I could think of myself as Jeff and ignore that I was in Mike&#39;s body. But every time I saw a sexy man, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I&#39;m not Jeff anymore. I&#39;m Mike.<br />
<br />
I found some women hanging out and tried to hook up with them. It was surprisingly easy. Most women don&#39;t even give me a second glance but these women just accepted me into their group right away. Then they started talking about women&#39;s stuff, stuff I usually just nod my head to as I try to seduce them. But I couldn&#39;t get them to shut up about it. I even caught myself talking along with them. Finally I had enough and stuck my arm around one of them.<br />
<br />
She turned to me and said, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was speechless.<br />
<br />
She said, &quot;I thought you were a nice guy. Get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
I left but now I was desperate. I wasn&#39;t desperate for sex but I was desperate to prove to my self that I wasn&#39;t gay. I found a prostitute but I couldn&#39;t keep myself interested in her. My thoughts kept wandering to men.<br />
<br />
The prostitute told me, &quot;It happens sometimes.&quot; Then she had pity on me and gave me my money back. I didn&#39;t take it. I just left.<br />
<br />
I found one of those ex-gay places and pounded on the door. I begged for them to cure me. They complained about the late hour but they gathered a few people to pray over me and exercise the gay spirit out of me. They were brutal, pushing me, yelling at me.<br />
<br />
I cried and cried until I was spent. I fell asleep but they woke me up. They asked me if the evil spirit had left me and I said I didn&#39;t know. So they continued pushing and hollering and sprinkling me with something.<br />
<br />
Finally, I did feel this euphoric state. I shouted I&#39;ve been healed. They told me they didn&#39;t have any beds available so I would have to go home but they wanted to see me again to make sure I stayed clean.<br />
<br />
I drove away exhausted and confused but feeling so high that I managed to make it home. I crawled into bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning, I awoke to Mike&#39;s mom yelling at me that I would be late for school. I jolted and curled up in a ball in the corner of the room. I must have made some noise because Mike&#39;s mom burst in asking me, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t say anything but I was shaking. She felt my forehead and said, &quot;You don&#39;t seem to have a fever but your clammy and shaking. It&#39;s alright if you want to stay home today.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No, I want to go to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said, &quot;Alright but don&#39;t rush yourself. Take it easy and go when you&#39;re ready. Unfortunately, I have an appointment so I won&#39;t be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She left. I eased myself out of bed and headed for the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and saw Mike&#39;s face. I took a long hot shower and went back to my room. I looked through Mike&#39;s stuff and liked what I saw. He was into a lot of the same things I was into. I read his car magazines. Mike had the same subscriptions I had. Then I read his sports magazines which also matched mine. I looked to see if he had any porn and sure enough but it wasn&#39;t the same magazines I had. I decided to exercise instead.<br />
<br />
Mike did have a few weights. He had more upper body strength than I did and could lift heavier weights. I enjoyed working out in Mike&#39;s body. Correction, my body. He switched with me.<br />
<br />
I went back to the mirror to look at myself. I looked good. I looked as good as Jeff did. I took off my clothes and looked at my whole body. I looked good. I started playing with myself and it felt good. I went and did some more exercises while naked and felt really good.<br />
<br />
I started to get turned on and decided to hell with it. This is my body now. I pleasured myself. Then I started looking at Mike&#39;s gay porn but I was too turned on to care. I just let the images of men play around in my head until I came. It was not the best orgasm I ever had but it wasn&#39;t the worst either. It felt good.<br />
<br />
I cleaned up and got dressed. Fine, I&#39;m Mike today and I&#39;m going to school as Mike.<br />
<br />

<br />
Mike&#39;s POV<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s twenty-first birthday was coming up and I wondered if we would switch back in time or if Jeff would miss his birthday while being stuck in my body. But other than plead with the fairy godmother who did this to us, there wasn&#39;t much I could do.<br />
<br />
I spent a good part of the night trying to compare my memories with Jeff&#39;s memories. Jeff&#39;s memories came easily but my own memories weren&#39;t as clear. I had to really concentrate just to get a vague idea of how my life had been before I swapped with Jeff.<br />
<br />
My dad was a pastor of a very conservative church who spoke often against homosexuality. I had not come out to my parents yet and was still keeping it a secret.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad was not very religious at all. He didn&#39;t attend church and never brought up the subject of god but if someone asked him what his religion was he said, &quot;I&#39;m a Christian of course. That&#39;s the religion of America.&quot;<br />
<br />
My dad talked often about how women were the weaker sex that needed to be cared for and sheltered.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad had no respect for women at all. He even called his own wife his woman.<br />
<br />
One thing both Jeff and I had in common was that both our dads were workaholics that were never home. But at least Jeff&#39;s dad would occasionally take Jeff hunting or fishing. My dad went hunting and fishing too but never took me with him.<br />
<br />
I began to see where Jeff&#39;s homophobia came from. Not that I wanted to go hunting and fishing but I could tell that Jeff was struggling with feelings of abandonment because the only time he spent with his father was trying to be a man like his father.<br />
<br />
Then I realized another difference between Jeff and me. My parents had actively discouraged me from hanging out with guys like Jeff. My parents had called them sinners and wanted to protect me from their evil influence. But in keeping me from hanging out with guys like Jeff, my parents had unknowingly steered me toward hanging out with a different crowd, one that was just as sinful in my dads eyes as Jeff but more covert about it.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s parents had pushed Jeff to hang out with jerkwads in the bars where men treated women like whores. Jeff was encouraged to see women as trophies and conquests.<br />
<br />
The morning came and I got ready for school but tried to avoid Jeff&#39;s family as much as possible. I especially hated Jeff&#39;s dad.<br />
<br />
I made it to school expecting to see Jeff but he wasn&#39;t there. Being in college, that isn&#39;t such a big deal. You can skip classes as much as you want and the only penalty is poor grades which leads to not being eligible for the rugby team. But after last night, I wanted to know if Jeff was okay.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t make it in until after lunch. When he did show up, I was shocked. He was running around like a pervert openly staring at passing guys and occasionally touching them in very sexual ways.<br />
<br />
I yanked him aside and asked him, &quot;Why are you acting that way in my body?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I&#39;m gay aren&#39;t I. Isn&#39;t that what gay guys do?&quot;<br />
<br />
I snapped, &quot;Not if they want to live to see tomorrow. What&#39;s the matter with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I can&#39;t help it.&quot; I felt his hand stroking my ass. &quot;You have such a fine ass you know that? Do you want to make out?&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt like hitting him. I honestly felt like beating this faggot up. How dare he perv on me.<br />
<br />
But what I did was I told him, &quot;You&#39;re in my body. Don&#39;t mess up my life. Don&#39;t give me the reputation of being a pervert. I don&#39;t want you sleeping around and creating chaos for me to deal with when we switch back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff straightened up and said, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll control myself. Have you been sleeping around in my body?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No. I&#39;m a hetero jerkwad now. I don&#39;t want guys and girls don&#39;t want me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Yea, that sounds about right. I can help you find some girls if you&#39;re interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No thanks. Do you think that&#39;s why I switched with you, so I could sleep with girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Well, yea. It&#39;s the natural order of things. Guys chase girls&quot;.<br />
<br />
I felt like hitting him again but this time for being a homophobic prick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to sleep with girls and I don&#39;t want you sleeping with guys either while we&#39;re swapped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little late for that.&quot; Jeff said, &quot;I met this really cute twink in the bathroom...&quot;<br />
<br />
I slapped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I said, &quot;I realize this isn&#39;t easy for you. This isn&#39;t easy for me either.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked hurt but then he started laughing. Jeff said, &quot;You&#39;ve wanted to hit me for a while now and I&#39;ve wanted to hit you. Now we&#39;ve both hit each other in a way. You&#39;re mind and my body slapped my mind and your body. ha ha ha.&quot;<br />
<br />
I groaned. Then I began to chuckle too.<br />
<br />
I started calling, &quot;Okay fairy godmother. We&#39;ve learned our lesson now. You can switch us back.&quot;<br />
<br />
But there was no answer.<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Maybe whoever expects us to do it together. You&#39;ve wanted me for months.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at him with no desire for him at all. &quot;I wanted you but not this way. Even more than wanting to have sex with you, I wanted us to be friends. I didn&#39;t need you to turn gay on me. I just needed you to not be such a jerkwad toward me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Okay friends it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
We went on to classes but caught up with each other frequently. It continued to be awkward but I could tell that Jeff was making a real effort.<br />
<br />
Then it was time for practice again and we got undressed in the locker room to change into our rugby gear. Suddenly I felt Jeff&#39;s hand on my naked ass as he said, &quot;You look hot today.&quot;<br />
<br />
It all clicked. I finally understood why Jeff didn&#39;t want me touching his ass. Before the swap, I would have thought that Jeff should take it as a compliment that I&#39;m attracted to him. But now I realized that Jeff, in my body, was looking at me as a conquest, a trophy. He had switched from looking at girls to looking at guys but he hadn&#39;t switched from looking for trophies. He didn&#39;t want to be friends. He wanted to use me and move on to his next conquest.<br />
<br />
Either that or seeing life through Jeff&#39;s perspective, I felt like a target. I did not feel complimented. I felt threatened. I felt scared. I wasn&#39;t a person in Mike&#39;s eyes. I was a game.<br />
<br />
I pushed his hand away, finished dressing and walked away.</p>
