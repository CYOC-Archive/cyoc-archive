<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday starts.  Martha wakes up with the biggest hard cock she&#39;s ever seen, one that just a few months ago she couldn&#39;t believe one this big could exist, let alone that it would be attached to her. She sat down and then got up, heading to the bathroom with his member dangling proudly in front of her, and there she started jerking off. She barely started to masturbate and already noticed that something was strange, she had the impression that her dick was bigger than the day before. She ran to get a measuring tape that was kept in the kitchen and measured it, and it confirmed that her dick really was bigger and was now 21 inches long. She thought that she had just measured it wrong the day before, with the surprise of knowing that she was going to be a father and everything else she thought it was a possibility and decided to ignore it, but when it was getting dark she couldn&#39;t ignore it anymore. She couldn&#39;t rule out the possibility that her dick had gotten bigger and after dinner, with her dick hard, she measured it again and now it was 22 inches long.<br />
<br />
Her dick was definitely growing and that had never happened outside of lab testing sessions.  Martha called Dr Alex and she answered that it was probably just the effect of the lotion that was taking longer to wear off than usual and should stop soon, but she would check anyway and get in touch if she found anything.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday Martha overslept and woke up at 10 am, and the first thing she did was measure her dick, which had grown longer and was now 23 inches.  She got up from the bed and felt an extra weight between her legs and looked at her sack, and found that it had grown bigger and fuller with the presence of a fifth testicle that had grown while she slept. Gloria showed up at her house, wanting to talk and make plans about their child, and was surprised when her friend told her what was going on. They went out to dinner together that night, but they had problems.  Martha got hard looking at the waitress and her cock, now 24 inches, climbed up her blouse and between her breasts, the tip sticking out through her cleavage and being exposed. She had to go to the bathroom to jerk off and then pay the bill and leave with Gloria.  She was ashamed, as with the continued growth of her cock and sack the amount of cum she ejaculated was increasing, and this time she left so much cum behind that she was afraid they would find out it was her.<br />
<br />
Wednesday Martha woke up hugging Gloria, having slept at her friend&#39;s house and sharing her bed. Her cock was now 25 inches long and hard passing between Gloria&#39;s legs, who was also aroused and had her own hard cock pressing against her belly. They had sex first with Martha sucking her pregnant friend&#39;s dick, then Gloria fucked her ass, and they ended with Martha having to stick her whole hand inside Gloria&#39;s pussy, as her dick no longer fit. Then Martha called her mother to report the situation. In the afternoon they looked for June, because the clothes she had made for Martha were reaching their limit and she needed a bigger one.  They left at the end of the day in a new outfit that comfortably contained Martha&#39;s 26-inch cock.<br />
<br />
Thursday morning Martha had breakfast, enjoying the fact that she was home alone and naked with her 27 inch dick rising in front of her.  Her cell phone rings and she answers Dr Alex, who immediately asks if the growth has stopped and receives a negative answer. After that she reported that they did a deeper analysis on the samples they had taken from her almost two weeks ago and found that there were still traces of the lotion proteins mixed in her blood.  They had come to the conclusion that it took longer for the product to be fully eliminated from the person&#39;s system and too frequent use could make the growth take longer and longer to stop. With that information Dr Alex said that all further tests of the penis enlargement lotion with her were off, but that she didn&#39;t need to worry.  Martha was pleased that they still had more test sessions and she would get paid as usual, but from the next session it would be to test an antidote they were creating to combat this problem caused by overuse of the product.<br />
<br />
At night Martha was watching some TV before bed, her cock having already reached 28 inches, when she felt a tightening sensation in her balls.  She immediately looked over to see what was going on and saw the sack rapidly increase in size and be occupied by a sixth testicle.<br />
<br />
Friday Martha woke up with a 29 inch hard cock between her legs, the cock almost as big as her leg, and she jerked off right there.  As her orgasm approached she pointed her male member at a cleaning bucket that was empty, filling almost all of it as she came. She then went to get something to eat before leaving, but she was unable to drive.  Her sack now had six testicles the size of melons and they were so tight in the space under the steering wheel and between her legs that they hurt like hell. She called Gloria, who offered to help.  Later, the pregnant woman decided to stay at Martha&#39;s house for a few days, helping her until everything went back to normal. And when she went to sleep she took a new measurement and saw that her dick had reached the 30 inch long mark.<br />
<br />
Saturday,  as soon as Martha woke up, she measured her cock and saw that it was still the same 30 inches as the night before, and later that day she took the measurement again and was sure the growth had finally stopped. On this day the most important event was when Gloria called Martha for a serious conversation, one in which she already started by apologizing to Martha. The single mother found this attitude strange, as she didn&#39;t know anything her friend could have done to need to apologize, so she asked why.<br />
<br />
Gloria responded by saying that she needed to apologize because she was so happy when she found out she was pregnant that she hadn&#39;t worried about how she felt about becoming a father, if she really wanted the child. Martha reassured her that it really had been a big surprise for her, but that she was happy with the situation.  As the conversation progressed, they decided that they would move to a bigger house where they would live together and raise the child together.<br />
<br />
After the decision was made, Martha decided to do something inevitable right away.  She called her mother and explained the whole situation, telling her that she was going to be a father and that she was going to live with the child&#39;s mother. Her mother was a woman who did not accept a homoaffective relationship at all and would normally condemn her daughter&#39;s attitude, but she also believed that much worse than that was a father who abandons his children for the mother to take care of alone.  Knowing that the experiment her daughter was participating in had made this possible, she was obliged to make an exception and congratulate her.  Peter was around and didn&#39;t understand the details of the situation, but he understood very well when he heard that he was going to be a big brother and he was very happy about it.<br />
<br />
Finally the fateful day of the new test arrived, in which Martha would test the antidote for the lotion.</p>
