<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A Vaporwave outfit? It looks like a superhero suit, but super colorful. And, like... glossy?&quot; Darius stared down at the bundle of clothing he was handed. Shirt, vest, shorts, baseball cap... It&#39;s less of a superhero costume and more of a rap star&#39;s outfit from the 1990s, if the rap star was faded in a washing machine and then coated in shellac. All the parts are stiff, and oddly heavy. Fred seems to think this is a superhero costume, though, and saying it just felt natural.<br />
<br />
Uncle Curtis points at the strange outfit. &quot;The base layer is at the bottom of the pile, Fredrick. It should already be lubed up and ready to wear. If you had ANY idea how hard it was to get this thing made in your size, you&#39;d appreciate it more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius digs his hands down past several other articles of clothing, eventually hitting a tightly-folded square of white. A sharp artificial scent hits his nostrils as the tacky garment unfolds with a sticky sound. It&#39;s a bodysuit- white latex, nearly paper-thin, destined to cover Fred&#39;s body from the neck down. If Darius wasn&#39;t already wearing something very similar, he might have been taken aback. &quot;So I just slip it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;d tear it. I&#39;LL slip it on you. Get in the swivel chair and we&#39;ll make it quick.&quot; The old man watched Fred sit his bare bottom on the cushion, steam still clinging to his skin. With the tight collar of the suit stretched open, Curtis began to ease the boy&#39;s legs into the body stocking. There was a soft squeaking sound as the rubber slid across Fred&#39;s skin, caressing his body all the way down to the tips of his toes. As Fred&#39;s feet stretched the latex it was encased in, his toes, heels and ankles were just barely visible through the thinnest parts of the fabric. Curtis rolled the legs of the suit up gently as they flowed over Fred&#39;s calves and crested his knees, also stretched thin over his kneecaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmnf...&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius huffed and bit his lower lip. He&#39;d never actually worn latex fetish wear before, and feeling it with Fred&#39;s sensitive body was something he wasn&#39;t prepared for today. Flexing Fred&#39;s toes produced small creaking and snapping noises as it stretched against his small frame. He swung his legs slowly and felt no air rushing against him. Darius felt a blush growing on Fred&#39;s face... and felt a twitch in his cock as it began to stiffen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it, don&#39;t you?&quot; Curtis patted the boy on the head, then went back to pulling his suit up to his thighs. &quot;Think you&#39;ll be able to hide it? It&#39;s a pretty tight outfit, and it&#39;s small, but it&#39;s not THAT small. Now stand up so I can get this stuff over your keister, you&#39;ll REALLY like this part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius obliged &quot;Uncle Curtis&quot;. The soles of Fred&#39;s feet made quiet sticking noises against the tile floor. His manager stood close behind him- uncomfortably close- and began swaying the kid&#39;s hips from side to side as he eased the tight garment up and over his pelvis. Darius felt his penis reach full mast a while ago, but now the whole length was flipped up and plastered against his belly by a smooth surface which kept caressing him like solidified ocean waves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... ooooh... mm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, bigger than ever. Sorry Fred, it looks like you might need some help with your, uh, &#39;modesty&#39; there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Shut up...&quot; Darius was filled with conflicting emotions as the suit slid up his belly. This wasn&#39;t exactly his body to &quot;enjoy&quot;, and he resented the sad old man claiming to be his manager more with every passing second. At the same time, he was pretty sure the real Fred Hollyhock wasn&#39;t conscious or aware of what was happening right now. If I&#39;m taking a hit for Fred right now, Darius thought to himself between caresses, this probably counts as an overall good thing, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Fred&#39;s hands were encased in thin white latex, fingertips and elbows just barely visible behind the barrier. Curtis pulled the neck of the suit tight; the suit&#39;s collar was thick and opaque, anatomically following the contours of Fred&#39;s jawline and covering the back of his neck. As the last few kinks were yanked away, Darius couldn&#39;t help but notice that Fred&#39;s nipples were poking up from underneath the latex. He felt them, hard from the cool dressing room air, and his cock twitched once more.<br />
<br />
Curtis let out a mocking &quot;Pfft&quot; as he fetched more of the costume. &quot;Don&#39;t get too excited yet, you&#39;re barely started.&quot;<br />
<br />
A pair of black rubber socks fell into Fred&#39;s hands. They were far too thick to be for casual wear, nearly two millimeters, and permanently molded into the shape of the foot it was meant for. Darius turned one them inside-out as he pulled them on. &quot;Did you... uh... make a cast of my body? I don&#39;t remember you doing that, uncle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, every genius has their methods.&quot; Curtis stared intently as Fred&#39;s feet were enveloped up to the ankle. The mold was thicker at the cuff, imitating the folds of a slightly bunched-up sock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle? I can&#39;t move my toes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to, Fredrick. Now raise your arms.&quot; Curtis quickly drops a black rubber T-shirt over Fred&#39;s head, filling the air with squealing noises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnf, stop pulling my hair!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, your head is almost through.&quot; Curtis finished getting the shirt on him and smoothed out a few creases, making sure the Windows logo on the front was readable. He then dropped a puffy magenta vest over Fred&#39;s shoulders- amazingly not rubber, merely polyester with a chunky plastic zipper. Darius blinked as beads of sweat were already dripping down into his eyes. The hem of the shirt was squeezing around his belly, caressing the very tip of his penis in a way which was difficult to ignore. Even trying to take a deep breath was making the components of his costume shift around in an erotic way.<br />
<br />
Being given a pair of chunky cyan rubber gloves was almost a relief. &quot;Right, right, next part,&quot; said Darius. Though they had textured palms like a pair of motocross gloves would, their stiff and chunky construction was better suited for electrical work, if anything. Darius had just enough manual dexterity left to buckle the wrist straps on the gloves, holding them snug against his hands.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Curtis strapped a pair of silver-dyed Velcro sneakers onto Fred&#39;s feet. To Darius&#39; dismay (but not his surprise), the shoes fit perfectly over the black rubber socks without any resistance, custom-molded to the shape. &quot;Okay, enough sitting,&quot; said Curtis as he picked up Fred and stood him up. The stiff, springy soles of his new shoes had chunky boot treads which conformed to the shape of the floor beneath them.<br />
<br />
Darius put on the cyan baseball cap he was given- backwards, of course, with exactly one lock of his bangs sticking out of the front. &quot;Open wide,&quot; said Curtis, &quot;This part&#39;s important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Click. Fred&#39;s upper teeth were lined with the metal rim of a dental retainer, saliva already beginning to coat its icy blue resin body. &quot;Thish ishn&#39;t necchecchary, Bossh. My teetsh are already perfect. I can barely schpeak with thish on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Test audiences thought it was cute. I&#39;d agree! It&#39;s so cute that we almost forgot your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh.&quot; Darius looked down and remembered what his costume wasn&#39;t concealing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re still rock-hard. Go on, Fredrick, do something about it. We have slightly less than twenty minutes until the shoot starts. I&#39;m waiting...&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Darius a moment to realize what his manager meant. With trembling fingers, Darius began to stroke his erection... and immediately heard a sigh of relief behind him. Doing his best to ignore that, he kept petting himself, allowing his muscles to tense and his legs to start shaking, heavy treads keeping him from sliding on the floor. If he closed his eyes, it was almost a normal lazy weekend back home. Just a little more and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooooh...&quot;<br />
<br />
SQUIRT.<br />
<br />
It was a bit anti-climatic. The only real change was that Fred had a translucent white stain on his belly... under a translucent white latex suit, cleverly concealed. Darius was still blushing and hyperventilating; he was not even slightly emotionally prepared for whatever was happening here. &quot;I... you... I... Bossh... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
He was interrupted by Curtis grabbing Fred&#39;s rapidly shrinking penis (MMF!) and rotating it so it pointed downwards. At some point while Darius was touching himself, Curtis had stepped Fred&#39;s body into a bright magenta bikini bottom which he was only pulling up over Fred&#39;s crotch right then. This thick pink layer painted over Darius&#39; crotch, leaving only a smooth bulge which shined under the vanity lights. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you shaid there were pantshOOOH...&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis interrupted his client&#39;s rambling with a quick squeeze of his bulge. &quot;If you can still feel that, then it isn&#39;t the pants. One more major piece...&quot; A pair of cyan cargo shorts- heavy, stiff rubber- travelled up Fred&#39;s legs and buttoned closed right at his belt line. The waistband of his pink briefs just slightly poked out from the top of the pant&#39;s waist, a cheeky reminder of why Darius was being dressed like this.<br />
<br />
Some spray-on freckles, a tan adhesive bandage over the bridge of his nose, and &quot;Fred&quot; was fully in costume. &quot;I feel ridicloush...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, It&#39;ll all make sense once the shoot starts. Guess what the photoshoot is. Go on, guess.&quot;</p>
