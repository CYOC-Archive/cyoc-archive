<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ross was watching Wes asking people about Allison&#39;s whereabouts from a distance. Apparently, from what he could glean, she had disappeared earlier in a panic, and Wes was getting worried about her. Ross kept that in mind as he went to met Diego.<br />
<br />
&quot;That meddlesome girl might become a problem,&quot; Ross said after he told Diego what he saw earlier. &quot;I&#39;m worried that she&#39;ll do something like try and reverse our wishes if we leave her alone.&quot; Although Ross had no clue what they were going to do. He didn&#39;t want to hurt her, but how were they going to convince her otherwise? He doubted Diego had any ideas either, but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I already took care of that.&quot; Diego nonchalantly stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did?&quot; Ross replied, quite confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I went to the carnival earlier and wished for Allison to turn into a man.&quot; Ross looked even more confused after Diego&#39;s explanation. Clearly, some clarification was needed. &quot;You see, Allison is concerned about her boyfriend changing without explanation, right? I think she&#39;s worried that he&#39;ll leave her behind. So, if she changes along with him, she won&#39;t feel left behind anymore. Plus, if she tries to reverse the wish, she might just reverse the wish on herself instead of the entire school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross was quite impressed, honestly. It wasn&#39;t a perfect solution, but it was a solution that&#39;s going to work well enough if everything goes to plan, and if doesn&#39;t, they&#39;ll have time to think of something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you clever? Looks I need to give you something special to reward you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Back in the groundskeeper&#39;s office, Kendel was fondling Allison&#39;s breasts when he noticed that they felt different than they usually do. For some reason, they felt like they were smaller, maybe even harder? Kendel would have pondered this more, but then he felt someone was servicing his dick.<br />
<br />
Lost in pleasure, the groundskeeper quickly wrote it off as him having bigger and more muscular hands made her breast feel different to him. In fact, all three of them were too distracted to notice the subtle changes happening to Allison&#39;s body. Like her slowly growing taller and her muscles getting more defined.<br />
<br />
It wouldn&#39;t be long before they would notice, however.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mr. Clark was in the teacher&#39;s lounge casually texting Darlene about their date tonight. Although, honestly, Alex wasn&#39;t as excited about his date as he was before. Don&#39;t get him wrong, he was still excited about dating again, but not as much as when he first matched with Darlene. Perhaps the rush of excitement from having a younger woman interested in dating him was starting to wear off. Or maybe it was because Darlene didn&#39;t seem to be looking for a serious relationship at the moment. Honestly, if Alex wanted something casual, there was plenty of hot singles at the school, not to mention Chad at the gym. Now that he thought of it, it was surprising how many single teachers and faculty there were.<br />
<br />
Really, though, Alex was looking more forward to hitting the gym with the other teachers. He wanted to show off his newfound strength to his co-workers and show them why he was nicknamed the muscle monster in his youth. He also wanted to see just how strong the other teacher and faculty were getting. <br />
<br />
... And to see how hot they were getting. Ugh, just thinking about this was making him horny. Thankfully Alex knew how to control himself, unlike some of the other teachers. Speaking of which, it seems like Mr. Suarez had just arrived in the teacher&#39;s lounge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, there, Alex. You getting ready for your date?&quot; It seems like the school&#39;s rumor mill was going as fast as ever. &quot;Well, here some advice, first you- Hgnn!&quot; However, before Alex could even roll his eyes at Suarez&#39;s advice, Suarez had doubled over clutching his stomach. Alex immediately got up to see what was wrong; however, their concern shifted to amazement once William lifted up his shirt. They watched in awe as Suarez&#39;s stocky midsection had turned into abs right before their eyes.<br />
<br />
It was then Alex was starting to look at Suarez differently. Was he finding him attractive? It was shocking at first, but after his sexual awakening, maybe it wasn&#39;t that strange to find more men attractive. Besides, just because he was now finding Suarez attractive didn&#39;t mean he had to act on those feelings, right? Oh boy.</p>
