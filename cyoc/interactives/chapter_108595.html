<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob struggled over the decision, he really did. He knew that giving in was tantamount to relinquishing what little control he had left, to being reduced to hoping that James didn&#39;t do anything with the Chronivac that he couldn&#39;t reverse. The thought chilled him from his tiny, wiggly toes all the way up to his soft mop of curly black hair. But twenty-three years&#39; worth of fantasies are hard to resist - and as he watched his friends indulge in pleasures both infantile and adult, he felt the wall of resistance begin to crumble. It did not fall, however, until his body gave him the nudge he needed.<br />
<br />
He felt his tummy rumble and knew exactly what that internal churning was a preview of, a little whimper escaping his lips as he shifted his balance from tiny foot to tiny foot, doing what little he could to hold it back until he could be sure that this was what he wanted. Was he really going to let this happen? Was he going to squat in the middle of this office turned daycare - the office in which he, as recently as a few minutes ago, worked as a twenty-eight year old man - and fill his diaper? He wasn&#39;t...he wasn&#39;t <i>really</i> a baby, was he?<br />
<br />
The answer to all those questions, as it turned out, was yes.<br />
<br />
Jacob moaned as a cramp forced him to spread his legs and bend his knees, feeling as though his chubby little toddler body was moving of its volition. He felt the same way when he screwed his eyes shut and jammed his thumb between his lips, sucking on it with a newborn&#39;s neediness as he gave into every instinct, fantasy and desire - as he tugged desperately on his stiff little dinky while pushing a massive load into his diaper. The seat of his Pampers erupted in crinkles as it rapidly expanded under the weight forced into it, the plasticky symphony tickling Jacob&#39;s burning ears as his only concern became to poop his pants as thoroughly and completely as he could. He felt his diaper sagging further and further down between his trembling, pudgy legs, felt the strain of the tapes in their attempt to hold the whole thing together, felt a rivulet of drool trickle out of the corner of his thumbsucking lips and down his adorably dimpled chin. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;mma...I&#39;mma baybee...&quot; He babbled around that sucked thumb. He whimpered and whined and thrust up into the soft, cushy front of his infantile undies as he tugged faster and faster on a trembling stiffy that screamed for release. &quot;I...ahh...ahhhhh...AHHHHHHHHH!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob clamped his lips down on his sodden digit as he gave his chubby hips one final buck, burying his tiny rod into the yielding padding as the most tremendous orgasm of his life crashed over him. A wet warmth surrounded his pulsing little baby dick and for a second he thought he was shooting off - but the reality was that his bladder given way when he reached climax, and his squeals of infantile ecstasy were only intensified by the realization that he was soaking his diaper and drenching a garment whose limits had already been tested by what happened on the other side. Every undeveloped muscle tightened with coursing pleasure until the storm finally subsided, until he gasped for air as his wobbling legs finally gave way beneath him and caused the newly-minted baby to fall onto his tush with an audible squish.<br />
<br />
Jacob panted and squirmed on the carpet as he came to terms with what&#39;d he done. It was <i>everywhere</i>. All over his little baby bottom, between his legs, coating his empty marble-sized balls and softening pee-pee. Though there was enough of his adult shame left to make his cheeks burn in embarrassment, the dreamy grin curled around his still-sucked thumb told the true story. He was a <i>baby</i>. And he had never been happier.<br />
<br />
Through half-lidded his eyes he saw that his infantilized friends were enjoying their own afterglows - and he also saw James stride into the room and observe the scene with undisguised amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you all had a good one,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Can&#39;t let you stew in your own messes forever, though. And since you&#39;re closest, Jakey, I think you drew the short straw today...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob peeped as James plucked him off the carpet, holding up in the air by his armpits and raising his eyebrows at the way the toddler&#39;s diaper dangled between his smooth, chubby thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew!&quot; He grinned. &quot;You eat a rhinoceros when I wasn&#39;t looking, kiddo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob giggled and squirmed but then fell silent when he was pulled against James&#39; chest, when the adult held him close while carrying him over to the changing table. The baby was struck by how wonderful it felt to be cuddled like that, especially when he nestled up so close against James&#39; impossibly big body that he could hear the man&#39;s heart beat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot; James kissed Jacob&#39;s soft hair and gave him a little nuzzle. &quot;Looks like <i>someone&#39;s</i> awfully affectionate today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob could do nothing but beam and coo as he was laid out on the changing table and stripped of his devastated diaper. This was heaven. Everything about the moment - from the tender way in which James cleaned and powdered him to the tickle of the cool air on his wet little weenie - was exactly how he&#39;d dreamed it to be. That being the case, he was a little sad to see it end when Jacob taped him into a fresh pair of Pampers - though there was no denying that there was a different kind of niceness in being hugged by a new set of clean, soft padding. And whatever disappointment Jacob might have felt was mitigated by the massive raspberry James blew on his tummy, which made the toddler squeal and squirm and giggle like a madman.<br />
<br />
He was a baby. And he never wanted that to change.</p>
