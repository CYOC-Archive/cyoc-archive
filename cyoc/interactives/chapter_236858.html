<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tonya never thought she&#39;d ever have a chance to give another person her age a diaper change, much less her best friend, even lesser her girlfriend; the sheer extraordinary chance of this opportunity being available wasn&#39;t lost on her. It wasn&#39;t lost on Leah either, shy but happy, trusting Tonya as she laid her on the changing table.<br />
&quot;So, I have to ask...is this, like, a sexual thing?&quot; Tonya snorted at Leah&#39;s blunt, bashful question. She had removed her bathing suit, and gone with one of her t-shirts to cover up and her diaper obviously remained exposed.<br />
&quot;It...well, it&#39;s as sexual as we make it.&quot; Tonya replied. She won&#39;t deny the fact that the situation has her spiked up on pure horny energy, but she doesn&#39;t want to push anything too far; she&#39;s already thanking every god in heave for this chance, she doesn&#39;t want to ruin it.<br />
&quot;Well, you have a thing for this, and I&#39;m gonna get shit wiped off my vagina, so...&quot; She looked a tad nervous, probably just as lost on what to do if not more so. While Tonya&#39;s had a handful of boyfriends, Leah has no dating experience, and even less experience with ABDL...if she even knew what that was. Tonya gave her most genuine smile with a shrug.<br />
&quot;Leah, we don&#39;t have to do anything. Right now, it&#39;s just one girl helping another out, no sex involved. But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t make it special.&quot;<br />
Leah gave a sigh of relief, much to Tonya&#39;s joy.<br />
&quot;Yeah, that sounds good. So, uh...&quot; Leah put a thumb in her mouth and gave a wink, &quot;pwease change my diapee, Miss Tonya!&quot;<br />
The baby talk did wonders for Tonya, feeling her face flush. It was a joke, but also an open door to role play. Was she down for that? Tonya had to extinguish her desires before she got too heated and did something embarrassing. Leah chuckled as she removed her thumb.<br />
&quot;Wow, you really are into this! Man, I didn&#39;t know getting you flustered would be this easy!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh shush.&quot; Tonya spits back, face turning ever brighter. Feeling a little vindictive (and extremely horny), she picks up a clean pacifier and pushes it into Leah&#39;s mouth. The girl is surprised, but not off put, raising an eyebrow.<br />
&quot;The baby will be quiet while I change her.&quot; Tonya said in an authoritative voice. Not the one she usually uses when talking with kids, but one she...never really used before. Leah&#39;s cheeks flaring made her realize just how dominating the move was. Was it too much? If it was, Leah showed no signs of being upset, sucking her pacifier with a goofy smile.<br />
&quot;Sowwy Miss Tonya, awl be good.&quot; She said, and again Tonya was wondering how much is teasing and how much is flirting. Is there a difference at this point? They&#39;ve play flirted with each other before, but that was clearly in jest (or was it?). Now, everything they said had an extra layer of romantic subtext to it, and the shift really wasn&#39;t that big. Well, minus the diapers of course; that added a whole new layer of complications. But as Tonya said, they have time. If Leah was down for exploring a little role play, they could get to it. Now, she just wanted to change her girlfriend&#39;s diaper so they could leave the house.<br />
Popping open the tapes on Leah&#39;s diaper unleashed the full power of the stench, making Leah cringe.<br />
&quot;Jesus that reeks. Are you sure you&#39;re okay with this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Leah, I&#39;ve changed diapers infinitely worse than this.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but they were snot nosed little kids, not your...um...&quot; Leah petered off, looking flustered at just saying the word &#39;girlfriend&#39;. Not that Tonya can blame her, just thinking it made her giddy.<br />
&quot;Leah, I&#39;mma be real with you. At the risk of sounding horny as hell...this is not a bad experience for me. It is very much the opposite.&quot; Her face was burning, but Tonya wanted Leah to not feel insecure for doing what&#39;s one of Tonya&#39;s biggest fantasies. Leah&#39;s face instantly erupted into bright red, but she gave another goofy smile.<br />
The next few moments were simultaneously tense, content, nerve racking, joy tingling, and ungodly sensual as she removed Leah&#39;s absolutely packed diaper, then slowly and methodically wiped her down. Tonya tried to keep her attention on cleaning and cleaning only, but she could absolutely not ignore the little hitches in Leah&#39;s breath as she cleaned around her groin. <br />
&quot;Y-You alright?&quot; Tonya tried to ask calmly, despite every hair on her skin standing straight.<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah, fine, just...um, it feels...nice.&quot; Leah looked like a blushing mess, only barely catching Tonya&#39;s eyes before looking away, &quot;It, uh...never felt nice before. Or whatever.&quot; Tonya couldn&#39;t hold back giggles at her behavior. Leah never got to experience this kind of intimacy with anyone else before, and it filled Tonya with indescribable joy to be the first.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to clean up your front now.&quot;<br />
&quot;My...front? You mean my vagina?&quot;<br />
&quot;*snort* Yes, Leah, your vagina. If you feel at all uncomfortable, even a little, tell me and I&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, why are you asking? No one else asks.&quot; Leah looks flustered and nervous, but Tonya disarms her with a wink.<br />
&quot;No one else was your girlfriend before, now were they?&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s goofy smile returned, and though nervous, gives a nod.<br />
Tina carefully wipes down, cleaning all the little bits and pieces off that got caught in her bush. Despite the gentle touch though, Leah&#39;s breath hitches loudly. Tonya looks her in the eyes, silently asking to continue, and Leah gives another flustered nod. What should&#39;ve taken only a few seconds lasted a full minute, and Tonya herself was getting hot and bothered. Leah was clearly enjoying herself though, and every breath put Tina on edge. She said there didn&#39;t have to be anything sexual, but the tension was immense. Finally, she wiped off her butt, and gave a sigh of relief. They were both sweaty, horny messes by the end of it; it was probably the most intense diaper change either of them experienced. With a bit of baby powder, and a fresh diaper folded underneath her, Tonya placed the final tape and an audible sigh.<br />
&quot;So, how was that?&quot;<br />
&quot;F-...fucking amazing.&quot; Leah gasped, not able to look Tonya in the eyes. It was enough to get her to burst into laughter, followed soon by Leah. The tension flew right out as the two laughed at the absurdity of it all. Tonya sat next to Leah as she sat up, and the two smiled at each other. Those smiles vanished quickly as they both acknowledged how pent up they were, Leah&#39;s eyes wondering to Tonya&#39;s lips.<br />
&quot;Hey, can...can we-&quot;<br />
She didn&#39;t get to finish as Tonya closed the gap this time, grabbing Leah&#39;s mouth with her own. This time, there was no dirty diaper keeping them, and what was a peck before quickly evolved into something deeper. Leah straddled Tonya, who grabbed Leah&#39;s diapered ass, and the two spent the next several minutes exploring each other&#39;s mouths. They eventually had to come up for air, gasping from exertion. Leah was floored, entering a new realm of sensations, and returned to kissing with a needy desperation. Tonya laughed, choking a bit as Leah smashed their noses together and the two separated.<br />
&quot;God, so sorry-&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine! It&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;H-Holy shit...&quot;<br />
&quot;Ha ha ha, was that your first kiss.&quot;<br />
&quot;No...I mean, it was definitely a first but...you don&#39;t remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;Remember what?&quot;<br />
&quot;You were my first kiss.&quot;<br />
Tonya blinked in surprise, but Leah looked genuine.<br />
&quot;Remember in 5th grade? I got stood up in that stupid dance, and you dropped your date to be mine? Later that night, I dared you to kiss me and you did.&quot;<br />
Tonya furrowed her brow. The memory sparked in her mind, and though Leah heavily condensed it, she remembers it well. It seemed like just a silly, childhood action she did.<br />
&quot;You remember that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me? I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it! And you never seemed bothered by it, so I felt like I couldn&#39;t bring it up. I...I guess I&#39;m not surprised you don&#39;t remember it.&quot;<br />
Tonya wracked her brain in panic. There was no way. 5th grade was around the same time she started being interested in diapers, and liked to fantasize about dressing Leah up like one of her dolls. It was at that dance that Tonya realized how much Leah was bothered by people belittling her for her size after being stood up by a jerk that said she looked like a preschooler. From then on, she never allowed herself to think of Leah like that again. Oh what bitter, cosmic irony.<br />
The moment was interrupted by a growing warmth on Tonya&#39;s stomach and hands, along with a loud hissing. Looking down, the two saw a growing yellow stain on Leah&#39;s bare diaper.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m wetting myself.&quot; Leah deadpans. Tonya can&#39;t help but chortle at her dismay.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not enough to need a change.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jeez, this is going to be a really weird relationship isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s as weird as we make it.&quot; The two readjust themselves, with Leah sitting in Tonya&#39;s lap and leaning against her. The two just quietly cuddled, soaking in each other&#39;s presence. <br />
&quot;We could go out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean...that is why I was hired.&quot;<br />
&quot;Holy shit, I almost forgot about that.&quot;<br />
Leah looks up, and Tonya looks down.<br />
&quot;Well, we definitely won&#39;t get pregnant. That much we can promise.&quot; Leah says with a devious smile. Tonya just laughs. <br />
&quot;So, what feels appropriate for a first date? Especially given my particular circumstances.&quot;<br />
Tonya thought for a sec. &quot;Well...&quot;</p>
