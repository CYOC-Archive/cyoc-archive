<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You silently cursed the old lady as you walked down the dark country road towards your home. You cursed yourself for driving so recklessly. You cursed your roommate for drinking all your milk. You cursed your friends for demanding that you make that special dip that required the milk before the Big Game, the Big Game that you were now missing. And you cursed your luck for having this accident the one time you forgot to charge your cellphone or fill your gas tank. <br />
<br />
 But mostly you cursed the old lady. That mark on your ass really hurt. It didn&#39;t help that it felt like your ass was swelling, making the mark press more firmly against your jeans as you walked. With each step your ass felt bigger, putting more pressure on the sensitive mark. You wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if it was infected or something.<br />
<br />
 Lucky for you pain in other parts of your body distracted you. Your feet were killing you. They felt incredibly stiff and your shoes felt too tight. You would have taken them off but you didn&#39;t want to walk barefoot on the gravel. Your heels felt particularly stiff and you found it surprisingly more comfortable to walk on the balls your feet, almost on your tip toes. <br />
<br />
 You probably would have wondered more about your odd way of walking were it not for the other pains. Your belly felt bloated, protruding a little and pulling on your shirt. You knew you had let yourself go a little bit, but you didn&#39;t think you were that fat. You were a little worried that the infection in your buttocks was spreading to the rest of your body. Everything seemed to ache. Your head hurt, particularly your scalp. You winced as you felt two large bumps on the top of your scalp. You reasoned they must have been bruises, but for the life of you you couldn&#39;t remember when you had bumped your head. Your fingers felt stiff and numb, especially at the tips. It was hard to tell in the dark but your nails looked darker almost black, like they had been bleeding under the nail. You began to worry if the accident had been more serious than you thought. Maybe you had internal bleeding or something.<br />
<br />
 But worst of all had to be the itching. Every inch of your body seemed to itch and no amount of scratching seemed to relive the sensation. In fact it almost made it worse, as the itching only increased as you continued to walk and scratch. You felt a light fuzz on your swollen belly and decided you probably needed to do some waxing. You thought it was a little gay and you didn&#39;t consider yourself particularly hairy so you had never tried it before. But your roommate swore by it, saying the ladies loved your smooth skin. And if you were as hairy as you felt in the dark then you really needed a shave. <br />
<br />
 But you would worry about that later. All that mattered now was getting home.<br />
<br />
 So You trudged along the dark road, trying to ignore the continuing and seemingly increasing aches and pains occurring across your body. You pacified yourself with the promise that it would all be okay as soon as you got home, just a little bit further ahead. You told yourself to just focus on the road ahead, putting one foot in front of the other and tried to block everything else out. But when you finally tripped you could no longer ignore the changes in your body.<br />
<br />
 You cursed as you rolled on the ground. You had stumbled and tripped over your feet for some reason. As you lay on the ground you could ignore the pain in your feet no longer. They were so swollen that the seams of your shoes were coming apart at the soles. With a grunt, you pulled your shoes off and were shocked into silence at the sight of your transformed feet.<br />
<br />
 Not only were they swollen, but they looked longer and thinner. The ankle was bent at an unnatural ankle, explaining why you was walking on your toes. And those toes. They were a sight to behold. They looked swollen and thick, ending in a hard dark black nail. Worse the flesh of the swollen toes overlapped, making it looked like they were merging, forming just two large toes.<br />
<br />
 As you rubbed your feet you were astonished to see that your fingers looked the same. You had been ignoring them as you walked but now you could see that they were swollen, too, and appeared to be convalescing into just two large digits and a thumb. You tried to pulled them apart but the flesh refused to yield. Instead, the effort seemed to spur their growth. The fine hairs covering your hands and feet grew thicker, forming a nice fur coat of black and white spotted fur.<br />
<br />
 &quot;What .... what is happening to me?&quot; you said with fear.<br />
<br />
 You rolled on your hands and knees, trying to steady yourself enough to stand on your strange new feet when you were rocked by a strong pain in your back. You moaned and grunted as the pressure increased until a small bulb formed at the base of your spine. You couldn&#39;t see it, only feel it as you reached back and pulled on the developing tail. You could feel the thin appendage growing longer and hairier, with a small tuft of fur blooming at the tip. When it was long enough you pulled the tip in front your bloated belly and recognized it for what it was - a cow&#39;s tail!<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no, &quot; you jabbered nonsensically as you struggled to pull down your pants. It was difficult. Your discovery seemed to spur the transformation of your body and the pants were now much more tightly constricted against your body. Already the legs of your pants were ripping down the seam line by your enlarging thick thigh muscles - muscles covered by black and white spotted fur. With a snap the top of your pants came apart, pushed wide by your expanding hips. You were disappointed but not shocked to see a large pink sac with four thin nubs forming just below your bloated belly. With rising trepidation, you lifted your developing udder and confirmed your worst fear - your slowly shrinking penis was disappearing into the same slit that had already claimed your testicles. In vain you tried to reach around your growing udder and grab a hold of your penis, with the misguided belief that if you could just hold onto it maybe it wouldn&#39;t go away. But your udder just proved too large a hindrance and it slipped from your grasp, lost forever into your new vagina.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Noooooooooo!&quot; You moaned, as your mouth extended into a muzzle, two small horns pushed out from your scalp and your ears grew larger and rounder on the top of your head. The moan gradually became a mournful moo in the quiet, lonely night.</p>
