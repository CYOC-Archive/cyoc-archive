<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;I should call the vet,&#39; Dean thinks to himself, &#39;my pup is overdue, it is about time I see to it that he gets his shots. I also need to get him neutered and chipped&#39;. The 15-year-old takes out his phone and calls the veterinarian.<br />
<br />
Dean had heard from a new veterinarian, who had opened his clinic a few months ago. Everyone he heard talking about this new vet, say how good he is, he might be expensive, but the results are worth every penny. The teen starts to type in the number of the clinic, &#39;I want the best of the best for my puppy,&#39; he thinks to himself. As Dean raises the phone to his ear, he looks over at Jeff, who is still typing stuff into the program. The teen smiles, &#39;you&#39;ll be the happiest dog ever,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;now, what would be a good name for a Golden Retriever?&#39;<br />
<br />
The boy thinks for a while, then a wide smile appears on his face, &#39;Simba... yeah... that is a cool name,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;Golden Retriever&#39;s coloring always kind of resembles the color of a lion&#39;.<br />
<br />
As Dean is still staring at his soon-to-be puppy, he hears a voice as someone finally answers the call, “veterinarian clinic Dr. Johnson, my name is Clare. Sorry for have keeping you waiting, how may I be of service,” a young sounding female says.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Dean says, “what took so long,” he asks a little rude.<br />
<br />
“We are pretty busy,” Clare replies in a calm voice, “I am the only one at the desk today and we have around 10 people here”.<br />
<br />
“Oh...,” Dean says, feeling bad for snapping, “I am sorry, I am just a little stressed”.<br />
<br />
“No problem,” the woman says, “I understand, now what can I do for you”?<br />
<br />
“My name is Dean,” the boy says, “I just got an 8-week-old Golden Retriever puppy. He&#39;d need his shots and get neutered, also he&#39;d need to be chipped,” he continues. “I heard that you are new in town and also the best, so I was hoping you&#39;d still have a slot open,” the boy says hopefully.<br />
<br />
There is a long silence, “well, we actually have no capacity free for taking on a new patient,” she says. Dean is about to reply, when Clare continues, “however, I know my boss has a week spot for Golden Retrievers. Let me ask him and I&#39;ll get back to you, would you please give me your phone number”?<br />
<br />
“Sure, but please call back soon,” Dean says, “he really needs his treatment”.<br />
<br />
Jeff himself is unaware of what Dean is doing, the teen is to focused on editing his stats, the boy notices that he needs to pee. “Um... Dean, I need the toilette,” he says, stopping what he is doing.<br />
<br />
“No problem, Sim... I mean Jeff,” Dean says.<br />
<br />
Jeff turns around, blinking, “hu? What did you say,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Um... nothing,” Dean lies, “is everything set and ready,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yep, I only need to press the confirm button,” he says, “but... I really need to go,” he then quickly hurries past Dean and out of his room, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Once Jeff had left, Dean sits down at his computer and checks the settings, the boy shakes his head, “silly pup,” he says with a sigh, “he got it all wrong,” with that Dean starts to type.<br />
<br />
First Dean changes Jeff&#39;s mind, so that the mind of “Simba” would be the dominating part, next he changes the time of the transformation from instant to four hours. He then changes the duration of the change to last for two years... for now, he could change it to permanent at a later time. Dean also changes that Jeff would not question his demands and suggestions, as he checks the editing, Dean decides to undo the change of Jeff never existing. &#39;It&#39;ll be interesting to see what will happen if everyone remembers Jeff, but are unaware that he is my dog,&#39; the boy thinks to himself. Satisfied with the edits, Dean gets up from the computer and sits down on Jeff&#39;s bed, not a second to soon as the door opens and Jeff reapears.<br />
<br />
“Damn... Almost had an accident,” Jeff says, walking up to the computer, “well, let&#39;s get this on the way,” he says and clicks the confirmation button, not noticing the changes to his stats.<br />
<br />
Dean grins inwardly, just then his phone rings, he takes it out and looks at the screen, “um... I gotta answer this call,” he says, answering the call.<br />
<br />
“Greetings,” a man&#39;s voice is heard, “am I talking to Dean”?<br />
<br />
“Um... yeah,” the boy says, “who is this”?<br />
<br />
“I am Dr. Johnson, the vet,” the man replies.<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s eyes widen, “woah, why would the boss himself call me back,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson chuckles, “my assistant told me, that you are in need of a vet for your puppy,” he says, “normally I would not take any new patients, since I am booked out”.<br />
<br />
“Oh...,” Dean says, sounding disappointed, Jeff tilts his head in a cute dog-like way, causing Dean to grin.<br />
<br />
“Let me finish,” he then hears the vet say, “when I heard that your pup is a Golden Retriever I decided to make an exception. I&#39;d be more than happy to add you and your dog to my list”.<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s eyes sparkle, “really? Thank you so much,” he says, “would it be possible to come over today,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
“Most certainly,” the vet says, “I&#39;ll be free in an hour, I can squeeze you in between the next patient”.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hm... Simba might be still more human than dog,&#39; Dean thinks to himself, looking at Jeff, who seems to have become shorter, &#39;but he needs his shots and the other stuff&#39;. After thinking for a while Dean replies, “I&#39;ll be there in an hour,” and ends the call.<br />
<br />
Jeff/Simba looks at Dean, “who was that,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“The vet,” Dean simply replies.<br />
<br />
Jeff raises an eyebrow, “but I don&#39;t need to go to the vet,” he says, “I&#39;ll be only a dog for a week, remember”.<br />
<br />
“You still need to get your shots, you never know what might happen in a week,” Dean says, “also you need to get chipped and registered, or I&#39;ll be in serious trouble, you don&#39;t want that, do you”?<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, “n-no, but...,” he starts.<br />
<br />
“Quiet, boy,” Dean says and Jeff falls silent, Dean smiles, “good boy. Now, get out of those human clothes”.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down at his clothes, which start to look baggy on him, “bu-but I&#39;ll be nakey,” he says.<br />
<br />
“So,” Dean asks, “you&#39;re a dog and dogs don&#39;t wear clothes, no need to be modest, Simba”.<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, his hair already changing color as he continues to shrink, “Simba”?<br />
<br />
Dean nods, “your fur resembles the color of a lion&#39;s fur,” he says, “do you like the name”?<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, “y-yeah...,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Dean says with a smile, “now get out of those clothes”.<br />
<br />
Jeff does as told and soon stands naked in front of Dean, his penis erect, and his body looks a little more harier.<br />
<br />
Dean opens his backpack and takes out a collar and leash, “wh-why have you got a collar and leash, Dean,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Bad boy,” Dean says, “from now on you&#39;ll be calling me “master”, that is as long as you are still able to talk, which I hope won&#39;t be to long. As for why I always carry these items with me: I just wanted to be prepared for when I find the right dog”.<br />
<br />
Hearing Dean call him a “bad boy” makes Jeff/Simba feel miserable, he hangs his head, “s-sorry, ma-master,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
Dean walks up to Jeff/Simba and pats his head, grinning as he feels Jeff&#39;s hair already feeling more like fur than hair. “That&#39;s okay, Simba,” he says, “you have still got a lot to learn. Now, let me get this collar on you, we need to get going”.</p>
