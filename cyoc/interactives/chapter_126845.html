<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, we&#39;re here boy, and it&#39;s time to get you a proper collar, and dog bowl, and...&quot; Todd spoke as he pulled into the parking space behind the Pet Palace Store and Veterinary Clinic.   He paused as he turned around in his seat, and saw that Chad looked bigger, and was shedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, looks like mange?&quot; muttered Todd, &quot;no wait, maybe that spray is wearing off?  Chad, boy, you want to be dog or you wanna wear clothing?&quot; Todd reached into the gym bag and pulled out Chad&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
Chaddog leaned forward and sniffed his old shorts.  He remembered being human, but he really didn&#39;t want to leave master Todd, and he liked free balling it.  He shook his head, and snorted.  He wasn&#39;t sure what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Todd interpreted the action differently, &quot;No clothes then?  Right, boy, more spray then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad opened his mouth to bark in protest, but Todd already had the flea spray in his hand, and sent a blast full on into Chad&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, sorry boy did that get in your mouth, and eyes?&quot; he asked as Chad whimpered.  Todd didn&#39;t realize in the closed confines of the car that he too was exposed to the spray.   Chad was definitely looking like a healthier labrador.  Todd opened the door, and led Chad out of the car.  He didn&#39;t notice that he was getting hairier.<br />
<br />
Chad sniffed his butt, the master was different, more like the leader of the pack, thought Chaddog.  Human memories were buried deeply away by the spray.<br />
<br />
Inside the store, Todd grabbed a cart.  &quot;Oh, look two for one special on the leashes and collars.  We&#39;ll grab one of each.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nearby clerk overheard, and said, &quot;No, it&#39;s two collars for the price of one, and two leashes for the price of one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  Oh, well, we can always use a spare, right, Chad?&quot;  Todd said scratching his new dog&#39;s head. The cart was nearly full by the time the reached the Veterinary Clinic on the farside of the store.<br />
<br />
Chad sniffed and whimpered.  He smelled sick animals.  Todd coaxed him up on a low shelf which was also a scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;My he&#39;s a big boy, over 100 lbs.  Larger than most Labradors, is he a mix?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was hoping you could tell me,&quot; Todd said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you want a DNA test.  It&#39;s real simple we just swab the inside of the dog&#39;s mouth and send it into the lab.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any package deals, he needs shots too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have a total special where we fix the dog, and do the shots for free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s eyes widened and he whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he&#39;s not going to be fixed. Lemme see his license,&quot; she said reaching for the dog tag.  &quot;He&#39;s almost two, on his second birthday, his annual license fee doubles, if he&#39;s not fixed. If you do it at or before license renewal, the state will give you a fifty dollar refund on the neutering.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd pulled out Chad&#39;s wallet, and smiled.  Chad had $300 in his wallet, he had gone to the ATM before school because he had had a big weekend planned.<br />
<br />
Todd pursed his lips in thought, if Chad was fixed he might not change back, but if he was fixed and changed back Chad would be so pissed. He rubbed his chin, and said, &quot;Well, we got a few months to think about that. Just the shots and DNA test today, and the stuff in the cart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to take that to the front register.  Leave your doggy with me.  His name is Champ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, but maybe I&#39;ll change it to Champ.  We&#39;ll see.&quot;  Todd shrugged.  Chad was an odd name for a dog, when he thought about it.<br />
<br />
He told Chad to stay, and wheeled the cart toward the front of the store where the registers were.  Chad whimpered softy.  The lady shoved a long cotton swab into his mouth, and rubbed it around.  She put it in a test tube, and put a sticker on it.  Then she took Chad through the doorway into the back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, doc, got a shot job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fix im too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, owner hopes he&#39;s a breeder. Doing DNA test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, boy,&quot; Chad looked up in surprise.  He barked happily and licked his older brother Brad.  Brad was a veterinary student at college, and had a part time job at the Pet Palace.<br />
<br />
&quot;My aren&#39;t you a friendly dog! Uh, Chad?  Haha, my brother&#39;s named Chad too.  But he&#39;s a blond, and he&#39;s not nearly as affectionate as you are, Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was confused.  He let his brother inject him for ringworm, rabies, and distemper, whatever that was.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You would mind giving me a sperm sample, boy?  It would be helpful with project,&quot; Brad said, as his hand slid down Chad&#39;s belly.  <br />
<br />
Chad was only too happy to blow a load into a vial from his big brother.<br />
<br />
Todd was waiting by the counter when Brad led Chad out.  Todd had already paid the lady, and was eagerly fastening Chad&#39;s new collar around his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you go to the high school down the street?&quot; Brad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Doc, that&#39;s why I brought Chad here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might know my kid brother Chad, he&#39;s a senior there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I know Chad, he&#39;s the star quarterback,&quot; said Todd suddenly nervous that Brad somehow knew that the dog Chad was his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d you decide to name your dog Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You caught me, I named him after your brother. You&#39;re not going to tell him are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, but he&#39;s almost two years old.  So you really should seriously think about fixing him.  Even if he&#39;s all Labrador, he&#39;s a bit bigger than most, so may not be worth breeding.  Just saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t wanna lose your balls, puppy?  Believe me you won&#39;t miss them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well. I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, if he&#39;s as much of a horndog as my brother, every bitch in your neighborhood will be pregnant within a month.  So think about fixing him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My Chad or your brother?&quot; Todd asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They both could do with a set of rubber balls,&quot; Brad said bouncing a silicone prosthetic testicle on the counter like a super ball, &quot;Well, technically they&#39;re silicone.&quot;</p>
