<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck felt a tingle on his cheeks as his master’s paw stroked him and all he could do is nod obediently. More grey fur sprung up across Chuck’s chin and cheeks, forming a handsome and well-trimmed beard of soft fur, complete with a set of whiskers that happily twitched in the breeze. “Yes, my lord. It will be done,” Chuck murmured, already feeling uncontrollably horny in anticipation of doing Mark’s bidding. He jogged over toward the trailer with a bounce in his step as he put his powerful new legs to work.<br />
<br />
It barely even occurred to him that he was going into his father’s office as he peeked in and saw the young man sitting at the desk, still hard at work drawing up new plans. The young man (barely a man, at that) sat hard at work, letting inspiration fill him as he continued to design a fabulous palace to honor Mark and the other four Exemplars of the island. Chuck knew he had found the ‘otter’ that Mark had spoke of and confidently walked toward the desk, his naked body on full display for Bill to see.<br />
<br />
Bill raised his head at the sound and looked closely at his visitor. Underneath all the fur and muscles, without the long ears and beastly legs, he could still somewhat recognize his son’s face. “S-son, is that you?” he muttered in a high and youthful voice, his jaw dropping at how much his boy had changed. How sexy he had become. Bill let out a cute little whimper as he felt himself getting aroused at the sight of the muscular rabbit slowly walking toward him.<br />
<br />
“Dad? What on earth…?” Chuck asked incredulously as he ran a paw over the slim and youthful fellow at the desk. He ruffled the fur that was covering the otter-to-be’s chest, loving how sleek and soft it was. He peeked down and saw Bill’s cock throbbing in excitement and remembered the job he had been given. Part of him was a little unnerved by the idea of seducing his own dad, but it was becoming harder by the second to recognize this cute little guy as his father. He experimentally reached down and began to tease Bill’s rock-hard dick, engulfing it in one big, powerful paw.<br />
<br />
“S-stop it, Chuck…” the little otter whimpered, even though deep down he wanted the big buff bunny to keep going. “I-I’m still your father…”<br />
<br />
Chuck let out an amused snort. “You sure about that, little guy?” he whispered into Bill’s cute little ears. He gently pulled Bill to his feet and over to a mirror on the wall. For the first time, Bill got a good look at his young new body. He was slimmer than he had ever been, even the first time he had been that age, yet still he was packed with unexpectedly strong and lean muscles. Instead of a hairy chest, he had a full pelt of otter fur covering his chest, and his face had become downright cute with big blue eyes. Even so, there was still a bit of Bill’s old face in there, though it was harder to recognize since he was so much younger than before.<br />
<br />
“You look a little to young to be anyone’s father anymore,” Chuck teased, nibbling one of Bill’s ears playfully. “And by this time tomorrow, you won’t even be the same species as me anymore. You know that I think that means?” Chuck’s voice dropped down to a whisper.<br />
<br />
“W-what does it mean, Chuck?” Bill asked quietly, despite deep down knowing the answer.<br />
<br />
“It means we can do whatever we want to, little guy. Don’t worry, you’ll like this.”<br />
<br />
Chuck grinned and showed off his big rabbit front teeth, the he dipped down and found himself face to face with his father’s throbbing cock. Of course, he could no longer see the cute little twink as his father, so he had no problem running his tongue up and down the boi’s cock, getting a mouthful of musky otter precum and a long and lusty moan from Bill. Chuck took that as a sign to keep going, so he opened wide and took Bill’s whole length into his mouth at once, massaging his cock between his lips and gently running his buck teeth across Bill’s sensitive dick.<br />
<br />
“Keep going… Keep going!” Bill moaned, having given up on resisting the sexy and powerful rabbit man. He had no chance of putting up a fight, and why would he? He found himself bucking his hips into Chuck’s face, holding onto his Chuck’s long ears for support. With one last thrust he came hard into Chuck’s mouth, making cum leak out of the sides of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Chuck licked his lips and smiled, glad to have completed the task that Mark had given him. Bill collapsed back onto his couch, exhausted after cumming so hard. As he lay there, even more changes began to appear on his body. He felt a twitch beneath his tail as his butt began to swell up, giving him a perfect bubble butt that wiggled cutely as he walked. His coating of fur continued to fill in, covering his legs and rounded bottom and extending down to his feet, which narrowed into slim otter paws, complete with a thin membrane of webbing between his toes. With his powerful tail and otter paws, he’d definitely be just as at home in the water as on land.<br />
<br />
“Note to self, add a public bath to the palace,” Bill mumbled to himself as he dozed on the couch. Chuck chuckled at than and curled up right next to him, putting and arm around the cute little twink and relaxing.<br />
<br />
“Well, we’re definitely not father and son anymore, little buddy,” Chuck said, getting a blush and a nod from Bill in agreement. “If we’re both going to be Mark’s followers, I suppose we’re more like brothers, right?”<br />
<br />
“Something like that…” Bill whispered back, nuzzling up against the much larger and more muscular male. He caught a glimpse of the two of them in the mirror, well on their way to becoming full animal people. “You know, I don’t really look like a ‘Bill’ anymore, do it? Maybe I should go by ‘Will’, instead?<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me, Will,” Chuck said, giving the little otter a kiss on the mouth, tickling Will’s face with his new beard. “I can’t wait to see what you look like after our master finishes you. I’m sure you’ll be even more adorable.”<br />
<br />
Together, the former father and son relaxed on the office couch, awaiting sundown and for Mark to return and fully initiate them into his service…</p>
