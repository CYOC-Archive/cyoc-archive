<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marvin lived in the next town over meaning Wilma had about twenty minutes to think. Thankfully for her Marvin wasn’t much of a talker. As the two drove silently she found herself gazing out the window Wilma stared at the non descript houses and trees that passed by. As the two now pulled into Marvin’s home, Wilma could see an elderly woman waiting for Marvin at the front door.<br />
<br />
“Deanna,” Marvin called. “Help me get this girl inside, it’s important.” Deanna gave her husband an odd look as the barefoot 12 year old exited from the rear of the car. Wilma looked at Deanna as the woman gave her a curious look. As she entered the home Wilma could see the news was on, stopping dead in her tracks she listened as the news reporter gave the latest breaking news.<br />
<br />
“Tradgedy today as four TransDem employees died in a freak lab experiment,” the reporter stated. “Officials stated that Dr. Alan Hunter and Katherine Morgan along with two security personal Michael Hendrix and Wilma Harrison were killed during an experimental testing of TransDems latest energy generator. Police on scene. Have begun an investigation of the scene and have ruled out foul play. We’ll have more on this story tonight at 10p.m.”<br />
<br />
Wilma felt her heart race as the report finished. TransDem was already taking steps to ensure Wilma would have nowhere to go if she returned to normal. Already she dreaded what the company would do to her if they found her. The chronovac program was top secret and the company would go to any lengths to keep the secret. They had already declared Wilma dead, despite the fact their were no bodies. If they found Wilma and the chronovac she knew she would never see the light of day again.<br />
<br />
“Marvin who is this girl,” Deanna asked. Marvin rubbed his neck as he now sheepishly looked at his wife.”I’m not quite sure honey,” he said quietly. “I found her crying in the parking lot, I just couldn’t leave her their. Who knows what she’s been through. I’m guessing I should probably find out though.” Deanna gave her husband an annoyed look conveying a feeling of annoyance at her husband for stating the obvious. Shaking her head she only smiled before lovingly giving him a peck on the cheek. “That’s one of the things I always love about you hon,” she said quietly. “You always want to help the world.”<br />
<br />
Marvin smiled as he now walked to where Wilma stood. The girl appeared pale as she stared at the television. As he approached she turned, looking up at the man with sad eyes. “So tell me Wilma what exactly have you gotten yourself into?”<br />
<br />
Wilma sighed as she looked up at the man. He already had shown her more kindness than she deserved, and probably saved her life. Looking him over she had a feeling that being honest was better than being deceitful in this situation. Being only 12 meant that if he didn’t trust her she would most likely find herself out in the street or worse have the police called. Taking a deep breath she now looked up at Marvin.<br />
<br />
“Okay the truth,” she breathed, causing Marvin to nod and give her a stern look. “My name is Wilma Harrison. I’m part of the Special Security Services at TransDem. My mission tonight was to recover an experimental piece of technology two ambitious scientists had gotten a hold of. Unfortunately their were....complications. The scientists and my partner are gone. I’m now 12 and chances are TransDem is now searching for the device in my possession.”<br />
<br />
Marvin nodded as he looked the girl over. Although he could tell she was holding somethings back he could tell she was being honest with her. Sighing he now sat down in his easy chair, thoughtfully rubbing his chin. “Had a feeling it was something like that,” he muttered. “Look,” Wilma exclaimed. “I appreciate the help but I don’t want to inconvenience you. The device I have, the chronovac, it should be returning me to normal any minute. Once that happens I’ll be on my way.”Marvin now looked down at the device in Wilma’s hand. As the two watched anxiously they could hear a beep. Sighing Wilma now held out her arms, anticipating her impending progression. <br />
<br />
A warm sensation now engulfed Wilma’s body as she looked at the device. As she looked at her hands Wilma was shocked as the cuffs of her blouse crept further over her hands, leaving only her fingers exposed. Frantically she now grasped her chest as she felt her small breasts evaporate into her chest. Finally she could feel her skirt slide down her boyish hips, puddling around her bare feet. As the process stopped she looked at the device in horror, she was only 11 now.<br />
<br />
“No,” she whined. “It..it wasn’t supposed to keep making me younger. They must have tampered with it somehow.” Wilma now burst into a fresh set of tears, bemoaning her situation.<br />
<br />
Marvin had watched the process in utter disbelief. If he had not witnessed it with his own eyes he would not have believed it. In only seconds he had watched the girl in front of him shrink down becoming an 11 year old girl. Now her juvenile emotions seemed to be taking over as she sobbed uncontrollably. “Look Wilma,” he said, trying to comfort the devasted child. “Let me try to fix it. I’m pretty good at fixing machines, maybe....maybe I can fix that thing for you.”<br />
<br />
Wilma wiped her eyes on her elongated sleeve before nodding sadly and handing over the chronovac. “Listen this could take a moment but I’ll try to help okay. For now why don’t you head into the kitchen and grab something to eat.” Wilma nodded sadly as she trudged into the kitchen where Deanna was waiting. Marvin now returned his attention to the chronovac, hoping he could help the young girl before anything else happened to her or them.</p>
