<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’ve fallen behind in my History class,” Grant yawned. “You’re going to bump my grade up to an A.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Winnie asked in shock.<br />
<br />
“You know old professor Mansbridge? Yeah, tell him you’ll suck him off if he gives me a better grade,” Grant explained matter of factly. “Do that and your debt will be forgiven.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know...” Winnie trailed. She didn’t exactly like the idea of sucking off her own professor.<br />
<br />
“Come on, one more blowjob won’t hurt,” Grant replied while grabbing her chin and turning it towards him. “Unless you’d rather be my personal cum dumpster for the rest of the year.”<br />
<br />
“Fine!” Winnie sighed. “I’ll suck off professor Mansbridge.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Winnie sighed as she stood outside the teacher offices. This was stupid, she’d worn her lowest cut shirt and done her makeup and hair all nice just to seduce an old man. It would make the rest of the year awkward but at the same time it was her best shot at clearing her debt. She gave a deep sigh before entering Mansbridge’s office and closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
“Ah, miss Laurent, how can I help you?” Mansbridge asked. He was an ancient and stuffy looking man with big glasses perched on his nose and wispy hairs clinging to his head. All that hair had instead grown from his chin in the form of an extra long beard. He looked like he’d been a wimpy nerd as a kid and that fact was probably true based on the lack of pictures on his desk.<br />
<br />
“Hey professor,” she replied flirtily, toying with her hair and biting her lip. He was definitely staring at her cleavage which would have been creepy under normal circumstances but was exactly what she was looking for. “I was wondering if you could help my friend out.”<br />
<br />
“Your friend?” He asked while trying his best to hide his arousal.<br />
<br />
“Grant Lee from your History 102 class... he’s not doing so good,” she pouted while sashaying up to the desk. “Is there anything I can do to help his grade get better?”<br />
<br />
“Anything?” The old man asked.<br />
<br />
“Anything,” she repeated while licking her lips and making his pants tent. She looked down at his crotch hoping he was smart enough to get the idea. He may have been an academic genius but for all she knew he was an idiot sexually.<br />
<br />
“Well...” he trailed while staring deep within her cleavage. “There might be something.”<br />
<br />
She stepped around the desk so she was close to him and he turned nervously towards her. She stared directly at his pitched tent and licked her lips. His dick got harder at that motion and she bent down.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see if I can convince you,” she purred before her fingers undid his belt, button, and zipper. Within seconds she held an old wrinkled cock in her hands that sprouted from a bed of white pubic hair. She inhaled the scent, tried her best to ignore the wrinkles, and slowly wrapped her lips around Mansbridge’s dick.<br />
<br />
She began to work slowly, he was clearly excited and his member kept throbbing and pulsing in her mouth. She had to make this good so she began to lubricate it with her saliva. Tongue rolling over the rod and his taste getting up in her mouth. She hadn’t been sucking for two minutes when a knock came on the door. Mansbridge quickly made her crawl under the desk and slid his chair into place, folding his hands on the desk and beckoning someone in.<br />
<br />
He tried to keep a straight face while chatting with the philosophy professor but the fact that he was being sucked off with another person in the room seemed to make him hornier.<br />
<br />
Winnie continued to suck, and she started to get really into it for some reason. Old professor cock didn’t feel that strange anymore. She actually kind of liked it. It was a weird development and her eyes fell to a half closed position. She was really liking Mansbridge’s cock.<br />
<br />
When her eyes closed for a blissful moment something changed. When they opened again her eyes had turned a beautiful stormy grey colour, brimming with deep intelligence. She felt smarter, she was smart. She was a straight A history student after all. She continued to suck and her eyesight seemed to deteriorate. Glasses formed on her nose and perched on her face, clearing up her vision while her hair took on a deep cocoa colour. It tied itself up in a bun at the base of her neck, looking beautiful, organized, and professional.<br />
<br />
She was really into Mansbridge’s cock. It was the beat cock she’d ever sucked. She was loving the feeling it gave her. Her clothing began to change, seeming to regress through time periods. First it was modern, then it was from 2001 and then 1993. Blouses, shirts, pants, and shoes. It all went back and back until she was wearing a single brown pencil skirt, a white blouse, and a vest atop that. Her shoes had a light heel to them, and she was wearing more appropriate makeup.<br />
<br />
Mansbridge finished with his coworker and just in time too, because cum erupted from his cock and filled Winnie’s mouth. He moaned in pleasure and rolled back in his chair. He had to do a double take because instead of the college girl he’d just accepted a blowjob from, he was staring instead at the beautiful face of a girl he’d been crushing on when he was still in college.<br />
<br />
“Minerva Knots?” He asked in shock.<br />
<br />
“It’s Winnifred Knots actually,” Winnie told him while rising to her feet and sitting on his lap with a sexy look in her eyes. “Minnie is my sister. We’re twins so that’s an easy mistake to make.”<br />
<br />
“I-we-uh,” Mansbridge stammered before Winnie leaned forward and kissed him right on the lips with a passion he’d never known. The office was a blur, he felt a sense of vertigo, and when Winnie’s lips left his he was seated in the same university he’d been in seconds ago, except he was nineteen years old and all the calandras said it was nineteeen sixty nine. Winnie kissed him again, they were in the library and he was surrounded by books about everything he’d later teach.<br />
<br />
“Winnifred!” A voice identical to Winnie’s snapped and Winnie turned to see her sister Minnie standing there, also dressed in her librarian assistant uniform. “Stop being indecent with that boyfriend of yours.”<br />
<br />
“Oh and you never get indecent with Freddie Waynes,” Winnie responded brattily. Mansbridge was in shock. Freddie was the guy who’d prevented him from getting with Minnie, but now she had an identical twin who was sitting lovingly on his lap, her round rear pressed into his legs like he’d always dreamed about.<br />
<br />
Minnie blushed profusely but there were books to reshelve. So Winnie kissed him again and ran a finger down his cheek.<br />
<br />
“I’ll see you later darling,” she purred. “I just have to finish work and study for our history final. It should be easy. I love Renaissance history.”<br />
<br />
That made his dick go hard and press into her round rear. She smiled at the feeling and planted another kiss on his cheek before standing up and walking to go stand with her sister.<br />
<br />
“He’s cute, I’ll admit it,” Minnie sighed the second they were out of earshot. “But he’s got nothing on my Freddie.”<br />
<br />
“He’s got brains,” Winnie replied with a devilish smirk at her sister. “I doubt Freddie can write an A grade paper.”<br />
<br />
“Oh hush you,” Minnie responded with a cross look overcoming her face. “At least my children will be strong, yours will just end up with brains.”<br />
<br />
“Nothing wrong with brains,” Winnie sighed dreamily, unable to stop thinking about changing her name to Winnifred Mansbridge.</p>
