<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...you would evolve me again,&quot; June purred, rubbing her hind legs together. Jeff nodded, excited for what was to come. June could feel his heart racing, and lust pulsing down his shaft. She landed on the ground as the transformation began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d better make this a good one!&quot; she cried, as Jeff upped the settings to millions of years a second, pushing her evolution faster. A shriek broke from her lips as the energy of the Chronivac hit her.<br />
<br />
She grew quickly from her two-foot size. Her body became more sleek and streamlined, losing her fur to hard armored plates streaked yellow and black. Her exoskeleton cracked and reformed as her muscles grew strong underneath, and she rose to a full six feet - as long as Jeff was tall!  Her wings became just as indestructible as her body, yet paper thin. They beat against her back as a second pair joined them, both sharp as blades despite their gossamer appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;More!&quot; June yelled. Her posture was beginning to change, as her body rested on her two back legs while her thorax and head stood upright. All her eight legs grew something like hands, twitching fingers that would allow her dextrous movement. Her eight legs became twelve, as another pair helped support her abdomen, and another grew on her thorax. Six arms, and six legs. She flexed them as they grew thick and strong. &quot;Give me more!&quot;<br />
<br />
June had begun to tower over Jeff now. She was over twelve feet long, but her upright posture gave her a massive, eight-foot stature. Her mandibles clicked as she was suddenly given venom into new fangs, just as deadly as the one in her stinger, which had become as large as a broadsword. <br />
<br />
Something else had begun to change and shift away from insectoid physiology entirely. Jeff watched with great interest as six bumps formed on her thorax. They swelled quickly, becoming armored breasts with hard nipples, beginning to drip some sort of viscous substance. With a nod from June, Jeff reached out and scooped up some of it, bringing it to his mouth. It tasted like honey, but each sip of it sent tingles across his skin. His cock lurched to full attention, and his face flushed with heat. June clicked her mandibles with amusement. &quot;Are you liking it? It has certain properties I think we&#39;ll both enjoy later,&quot; she laughed, as the now fifteen-foot bee rubbed her new nipples. &quot;But how about you check out my actual &#39;honeypot&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widened. He ducked around to June&#39;s abdomen, where a gaping slit had opened up. June herself had spared a pair of her hind legs to rub into her folds. &quot;Come on, Jeff. The more you pleasure me, the more I&#39;ll grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which was true. With added stimulation, the Chronivac would evolve her to become more sexual. Jeff stuck his hand in and found super-strong, super-dense vaginal muscles clench and pull him further in. June moaned out. &quot;Oh, yes, come on, fuck me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s whole arm slid into her, up to his shoulder. He tugged on her clit, feeling it grow more and more muscular and large with each pull. The tentacle-like clit wrapped around his arm, holding him in place as June came for the first time, flooding his room with sticky, yellow cum. But she wasn&#39;t out of energy yet - the Chronivac made sure that she had an endless sexual appetite.<br />
<br />
Grabbing Jeff with two of her hind legs, as her total grew to sixteen, June shoved the hapless boy into her vagina feet first. Her powerful muscles sucked his shoes and socks right off his feet, before sucking on his toes. She felt her control and senses heighten as she flexed and trapped Jeff in her cavernous pussy. His clothes were ripped off him by her dexterous clits, as a total of three lashed about inside her. Everything was ground to dust and absorbed into her body, fueling her next change as spinnerets formed just above her stinger. Moving the walls of her vagina closer, she molded it around Jeff&#39;s turgid cock, and began to milk his shaft like no other. He unloaded into her in seconds. The cum floated around and was sucked inwards, absorbed by her walls. Some of them reached her eggs, but the rest spliced with her very DNA, allowing her the ext change.<br />
<br />
June roared as she felt a protrusion emerge just above her sopping wet pussy. Jeff looked up as a shaft began to grow above where his head poked out from her entrance. The shaft grew large and thick, with throbbing veins and a familiar mushroom-shaped head. Her muscular cock flailed wildly, becoming a prehensile, six-foot appendage she&#39;d be able to fuck an elephant silly with. As it happened, the head turned to face Jeff. Before he could protest, she began to lance it in and out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
However, the extra human DNA had helped to anthropomorphize her a little too. Her body took on more human proportions, hips widening, waist shrinking, breasts growing full and round. Her octet of human-like arms slid down her sides, massaging her new curves as her face softened to give human expressions. Antennae multiplied on her head, a forest of feelers that fell down her skull and the back of her thorax like hair. The tendrils could still move around on her whim, but <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was being assaulted by pleasure from all sides. One of June&#39;s clits had probed his ass and was now squirming inside him as it slammed into his prostate over and over again. Her other two clits were pulsating as they wrapped around his thighs and massaged his muscle, while her vaginal muscle clenched around his cock and made him cum again and again. Her fluids seemed to negate any refractory period he might have had. Jeff kicked his feet against her walls as two balls formed behind her monster cock, smothering him with their musky scent. His hands dug into her, desperately clawing as he tried to escape. <br />
<br />
June moaned. &quot;Oh, oh YES! J-jeff, you&#39;re gonna make me CUM!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a roar and a loud buzz, June orgasmed from her pussy and her cock all at once. Jeff was spat out, but not before he&#39;d ingested a good liter of her cum. They landed in a sodden heap on his floor, as June continued to climax and spray her thick, virile seed everywhere. <br />
<br />
Jeff crawled across the floor, dragged himself up to the Chronivac, and finally stopped June&#39;s evolution. Then, he wiped the juices from his eyes and got a good look at his creation.<br />
<br />
Twenty-five feet of solid, muscular bee had wound itself around his room. He thanked god for having high ceilings, as the new and improved June stood a whopping fifteen feet tall. She looked down at him with huge, compound eyes, letting her &#39;hair&#39; of antennae gently sway in an imaginary breeze. Her shiny onyx exoskeleton was broken up only by stripes of blinding yellow that wrapped around her body and accentuated her figure, making her look even more sexy. Down her front, six huge breasts stood with nipples as long as his cock, leaking out her honey-milk down her black, armored chest. Chiseled abs flexed underneath as June felt up her body with her eight arms, each rippling with powerful muscle. Her hips had grown, waist had tightened, making a strange, sexy hourglass figure. <br />
<br />
At the front of her abdomen, which was supported by eight, thick legs with finger-like toes that curled into the carpet, was June&#39;s cock. The six-foot pillar of muscle throbbed as one of her hands came to rest on its immense girth. Two testicles, each the size of yoga balls, hung down in an armored sack. Behind it, a slit that you could easily park a car in dripped honey down onto the carpet. Three huge, tentacle-like clits writhed around in her depths.<br />
<br />
At her back, four large wings beat, strong and impossibly thin. Her stinger glinted wickedly in the sunlight. Spinnerets sat invisible on her abdomen. And her mind was unparalleled in intelligence and sexual knowledge.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, my love?&quot; June called as she spread her arms and wings wide. &quot;Sexy enough for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gaped. &quot;Y-yeah, you&#39;re real sexy. But can you please not smother me next time?&quot;<br />
<br />
June put on a pout and lowered her head so she could look the human in the eyes. &quot;Oh, I am sorry, Jeffy. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. It just felt so good to transform!&quot; She grabbed him in her super-strong arms and pressed him close against her chest. &quot;Let me make it up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She kissed him deeply, letting her mandibles graze his cheek, exploring his mouth with her proboscis. Jeff moaned against her, wrapping his arms around her body, writhing as their chests rubbed together. June broke away. &quot;There, does that make it all better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff panted. &quot;A little bit, yeah,&quot; he admitted with a dopy grin. June made a face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, a little bit just won&#39;t do, Jeffy. I want to make you feel all good, alright?&quot; Her nails ran over his skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake. The huge bee towered over her human lover. &quot;Tell me what you&#39;d like me to do.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
What does Jeff want?</h3>
