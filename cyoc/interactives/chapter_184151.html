<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the 4th day of the trio&#39;s camping trip, and Trevor was still asleep. He dreamed of the night before; Ike, Kyle, and him having a euphoric threesome while he grew taller and more muscular. His wet dream was soon interrupted by moaning, one set from Ike and the other... also from Ike? He opened his eyes to the new day and saw a sight he couldn&#39;t comprehend. He rubbed his eyes to see if he wasn&#39;t seeing things correctly, but found the image before him the same.<br />
<br />
In front of Trevor was a valley of flesh; muscles galore. Looking upwards he found 2 separate Ikes making out with each other, each one frotting his two twin cocks against the other&#39;s. Their blowout 8-packs and Trevor&#39;s waist was stained with gallons and gallons of cum, most was from a couple of hours ago but some more recent sperm was also there. Trevor suddenly felt a rising pleasure from his dicks, or two dicks as it were. Looking away from the white bloodbath he saw 2 mounds 5&quot; wide impaling the two wrestlers&#39; bouncing, defined asses. Just as he began panting, the bouncing slowed down to a stop. He looked up at the 2 Ikes, their 4 clocks shrinking to semis and their faces becoming mortified and depressed.<br />
&quot;S-Sorry. We didn&#39;t mean to... d-do this...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah... we just woke up earlier and... we couldn&#39;t resist... sorry...&quot;<br />
Seeing the two of them so down broke Trevor&#39;s heart. He closed his arms around them into a hug and kissed them on the heads.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. I was oversleeping anyways, thank you guys for waking me up in such a hot way though~&quot;<br />
Trevor lowered his hands down to each of their nipples and twisted them. This, combined with the previous ass fillings and frottings, made all of the Ikes&#39; cocks cum over for a full minute. It would have just been a long 20 seconds, but Trevor continued to fuck their nice cheeks and play with their leaking pipes. Afterwards, Trevor got up with both Ikes still on his twin peaks, making them moan even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wellll, looks like we&#39;re gonna have to use the other beds for the rest of the trip, huh?&quot;<br />
Trevor noticed that his new voice had a deep baritone, deeper than the lowest note on a trombone or the sexiest voice an actor did. His two cum socks barely reached above his pecs, which jutted an entire foot out. He looked up to the roof and saw that he barely passed it; one more inch and he&#39;ll have to bend down.<br />
Neither of the Ikes answered him. They were too worn out from the night of wish fulfillment to even think properly. Trevor realized this and thought up a way to distinguish the two clones.<br />
&quot;Kyle? Are you good? I didn&#39;t stretch out your piercings, did I?&quot;<br />
The Ike on Trevor&#39;s right dick had all of the piercings Kyle got from movie night snapped back into reality. Just in case his face turned into a bloody mess, Trevor used negative form instead  of just &quot;Did I stretch...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah I&#39;m good. Just... I think I need a shower.&quot;<br />
Trevor couldn&#39;t look at their crotches, on account of his giant tits, so he felt around and immediately felt how sticky they all were. From their top abs all the way to the smallers&#39; feet and Trevor&#39;s knees, friction was near impossible. He patted their bulging stomach, some cum running out and down his legs, before walking towards the shower<br />
&quot;I think we all need one~&quot;<br />
<br />
The large clone carried the pierced clone and original clone by his double sausages as he went in. He took a quick look in the mirror and saw the hyper gay sight. If any man were to come in and see the trio, they would most likely turn to the green, white, and blue. He had the idea to jerk the two on him like fleshlights, but he decided against getting the cabin any grosser than it was. After all, he could just do that next time~<br />
He opened the shower and pulled the guys under his pecs, so as to keep their heads safe. However, even though he squeezed in, the shower was clearly too cramped for any action to be done. The original Ike looked down and said, &quot;Sorry, guess this is too small.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eh, I this looks big enough for about... 3 me&#39;s or 10 you&#39;s.&quot;<br />
The wish was risky, in the possibility that people will suddenly come into existence, but all that happened was the shower growing in size. The part that was the bathroom jutted out of the cabin, making an uneven bulge from it. Trevor looked over his creations and marveled in their glory. He was basically a God know, and he was ready to please like one.<br />
<br />
He turned on the water, covertly wished for 4 more shower heads, and grabbed ahold of Ike and Kyle. His hands made their way halfway around their chests, their sensitive nipples making their cocks hard again. Trevor began pulling, but the suction from their anal cavities made it harder than it should. The boys began moaning from the jerking, their minds being fried and fucked silly. If any person were to walk onto the property, the loudness and intensity of their moans would have immediately sent them away. The lust soon overtook Trevor and he started to fuck them in this unique form. He was now losing to Asmodeus&#39;s will and became a beast only resembling a human. His grunts became primordial growls, and a speed unmatched by any human became present. Soon, another dosage of salty white milk bloated the bois, most of it splurting out.<br />
&quot;Ah, Ah yeh. How that? You like that!? Fuckin&#39; sperm slaves. Yeah, take al my man&#39;juice! Get fuuuu-UU--AAAA---ACKED!!!&quot; yelled Trevor, a completely different being from how he was waking up, let alone when he came to the cabin. His stone glowed as the wails of his friends became more obedient and subservient. The next couple of climaxes stayed inside of them and inflated their abs into fat guts. Trevor didn&#39;t want his spermbanks to blow up, so he clearly wished for their stomachs to inflate to unnatural levels. After an hour of relentless sex, he had enough and started to take the doppelgangers off. two loud *pops* signaled that they were all separated. The separation caused the entire shower to flood to an entire foot in depth. Ike and Kyle were down for the count, but Trevor remembered his humanity. The tears that came from the intense earthly musk soon became tears of sorrow. His friends lied in their own cum, barely breathing. In just a moment, Trevor unwished their slavery and unnatural storage abilities away before passing out<br />
<br />
After 4 hours of lying down, regaining consciousness, and recollecting their collective breaths and sanities, Trevor -who wasn&#39;t all too comfortable using the stone- asked, &quot;Do... Do you... just wanna take a normal shower? Holy... shit...&quot;<br />
Ike and Kyle looked at each other in their identical eyes and...</p>
