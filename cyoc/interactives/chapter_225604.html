<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff gets up early the next morning and heads to the bathroom, after locking the door, the teen strips out of his boxer briefs he wore as he slept.<br />
<br />
The teen eyes the boxers, then looks at the fresh pair which are on top of his school uniform, Jeff scowls, ‘they are to boyish,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I should fix that when I’m back in my room,’ he then heads under the shower.<br />
<br />
After the shower, Jeff looks down at his body, his hairy arms, hairy arm pits, hairy legs… the teen grimaces, ‘body hair doesn’t suit me,’ he thinks to himself, he then sighs, ‘I should have thought about that yesterday, but no worries, I can fix some minor issues on my way to school. I just wish I could transform my uniform into a more feminine one, but I better not, I don’t want anyone think I am some kind of frat!’<br />
<br />
Jeff soon is sitting on the bus, on his way to school, the teen is sitting in the far back of the bus, typing into his new phone, luckily no one is nearby to notice the girly phone in the boy’s hand. The teen smiles to himself, when he feels his boxer briefs changing into lace panties under his pants and all of his body hair, except the ones on his head, reside back into his body.<br />
<br />
The teen soon arrives at his high school, when he gets off the bus, he notices that he is one of the first students to arrive, checking his watch, Jeff is surprised to notice that he is an hour to early.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, ‘he… this is a first,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I better wait before scanning the students, I’d rather do that when everyone is here, at least those who aren’t sick or skipping. I think I’ll start the scanning a minute before the bell for the first class chimes.’<br />
<br />
The teen decides to head to the cafeteria, there he sits at a table and just scrolls through his phone, he doesn’t notice a 14-year-old boy enter the cafeteria and sit a few feet away, taking out his own phone.<br />
<br />
The boy’s name is Jake, he has short blond hair, a pale, but healthy, skin tone, blue eyes and an athletic body. Jake is a straight boy, who is attracted to athletic girls, but he does not seem to be able to get a girlfriend. He always is able to get dates, or even get asked out by girls, but then, for what ever reason, the girls he dated suddenly do not want anything to do with him. This causes Jake to feel as if he’s been used, and THIS makes him furious, ‘I will get a girlfriend,’ he thinks to himself, ‘who does not use me as some “thing” just to make someone else jealous and then dump me a few days later, after getting what she wants!’<br />
<br />
Now Jake is looking down at his phone, ‘if I can’t get a girl, who isn’t a fake, and who instead WANTS to be with me, because she loves me,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I will simply MAKE myself a girlfriend. With this App I stumbled upon over the weekend, I will get what I deserve!’<br />
<br />
Jake looks around the cafeteria, there aren’t many students around, when he notices Jeff, the boy raises an eyebrow, ‘that guy as a pretty feminine body shape,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I must admit, from what I can tell, that his body looks way better that most of the girls at this school. Hm… I’m not gay… but… for some reason, seeing such a feminine boy, kind of intrigues me.’<br />
<br />
The 14-year-old, who is 5’6’’ shorter than Jeff, who is just 5’8’’ tall, causing him, Jeff, to be half a head taller than Jake, opens the App and aims it at Jeff, wanting to learn about the boy, since Jake has just started going to the school, before deciding if Jeff would make the perfect girlfriend for him.<br />
<br />
When Jake opens Jeff’s file and starts to read, his eyes widen in surprise, ‘a cunt-boy,’ the 14-year-old thinks to himself, ‘I never heard of such a… thing. What the hell is a “cunt-boy”? I better look that up.’<br />
<br />
Jake’s eyes widen when he reads what a “cunt-boy” is, ‘so… a “cunt-boy” is a male, who is born with the wrong genitals… apperantly this is something pretty rare and even rarer is that some cunt-boys are even able to get… pregnant, but only if the “error” has fully developed, meaning: the cunt-boy would have to have a womb and ovaries,’ the 14 year-old thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Jake looks up over at Jeff in disbelief, but the more he stares at the slim boy, and now knowing his secret, Jake can’t help but feel his curiosity growing. He even starts imagining what it would be like fucking a cunt-boy, his eyes widen and he looks down at his crotch, as at that thought, he feels his cock twitch and start to erect. Jake starts to grin, ‘hm… it wouldn’t be gay if I fuck him…,’ he thinks to himself, ‘a cunt-boy is nothing than a flat chested girl! I could get used to that, let’s see what else I can learn about him.’<br />
<br />
The 14-year-old returns to Jeff’s file and continues to read, Jake then frowns when he notices Jeff’s relationship status, ‘hm… so he has a girlfriend who is 18 and a boyfriend who is 9,’ he thinks to himself, ‘well… we can’t have that!’<br />
<br />
Jake is about to erase Rick and Jane from Jeff’s file, when an idea suddenly hits him, an evil grin appearing on his face, ‘what if I just erase Jane? I then would make him more submissive, before confronting him with his two secrets. Hehe… maybe, I won’t need to increase his submissiveness… I have the feeling that he’d do anything in order to prevent me from telling anyone about his dirty little secrets.’<br />
<br />
What Jake is unaware of, is that Jeff also has the Chronivac-App, but Jake is a smart boy, which actually makes him pretty dangerous, it even seems that the 14-year-old has some mental issues, which seem to make him somewhat of a psychopath. The first thing Jake made sure of doing, was to make himself immune to any other Chronivac device, meaning that, Jake is unable to be transformed, at least no one is able to transform Jake against his will.<br />
<br />
With his plan set, Jake erases Jane from Jeff’s relationship status and saves it, ‘now, all I need to do is to get him alone,’ he thinks to himself, grinning evilly, ‘hehe… you don’t know it yet, Jeffy-boy… but you are MINE! What I like about HIM is that he seems to be a virgin, which means he and this &quot;Rick&quot; character hadn&#39;t had sex yet, but what excites me more is that he has a functional womb and even ovaries! Hehe... oh, how I will enjoy popping his cherry!’</p>
