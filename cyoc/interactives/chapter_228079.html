<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio sat on Kats sofa, looking out towards the city, Kat and Mantis had gone to the upper floor to get something on that wasn&#39;t covered in Antonios blood, the stranger sat across from him, kneeling in front of the coffee table, Antonio eyed them with suspicion, the strangers eyes remained closed, their hands cupped around a warm steaming cup of tea which they had prepared themself, making a cup for Antonio as well, but he didn&#39;t touch it, he let it steam on the table, going cold as he sat with his arms crossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know....if I wanted you dead, there are faster and more efficient ways than poisoning your drink&quot; he said, taking a slow sip from his cup, his lips surprisingly full for a man, Antonio looked down at the cup, weighing his options until at last he caved, bringing the cup to his lips, the warm sweet taste filling his mouth, the heat soothing his nerves, relaxing his mind, taking another sip he let himself enjoy the warm aroma<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good no?&quot; The stranger asked, a small smile at the edge of his lips<br />
Antonio rolled his eyes<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah you can make a good cup of leaves and water, how is that going to get us all out from under Kovastov&#39;s boot&quot; Antonio said with a huff, leaning back on the couch, reading his elbows on the back, holding the cup in his fingers<br />
&quot;If tea could kill that monster, then this city would not be under his rule, or anyone else&#39;s&quot; the stranger said with a sigh<br />
&quot;True that&quot; Antonio chuckled.<br />
<br />
The stranger stood up from his crouching seat, Antonios Cybernetic arm twitching at his movements until the stranger finally removed their large hat, the round disk collapsing into a long metallic rod which the stranger stashed away in a black sash around their waist, they wore a simple grey kimono and a white scarf around his neck, all revealed as he pulled the black poncho from his shoulders, resting it like a cloak across his back, his form surprisingly slender and elegant, yet his human arm toned and strong<br />
&quot;Every man has a weakness, just like every man has their price, even men like Kovastov, the only question, is what is their price or weakness&quot; he said as he walked over and sat across from Antonio, who stared at him with caution, narrowing his eyes as he watched for the slightest move<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m guessing you know his weakness?&quot; Antonio asked, a look of curiosity now gleaming in his eye, the stranger nodded<br />
&quot;A man as powerful as Kovastov, cannot rule alone, to control the entire city would be too much for any one man alone, the only way to achieve absolute power is to create the illusion of absolute power&quot; he explained setting out Antonio&#39;s cup and his own, setting them out on the table before producing two more, and finally fishing out a a metallic tablet from his sash and setting it at top all four cups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kovastov is like this tablet, standing firm atop pillars of support and strength, each taking a portion of its weight, take one away, and the tablet becomes unsteady&quot; he whispered, removing a cup and sliding one into the middle along the tablets edge<br />
&quot;Take another away, and the instability grows&quot; repeating the action on the opposite side<br />
&quot;A third falls, and all that pressure falls to one&quot; taking the third cup from the table, Antonio watching and listening with concentration<br />
&quot;Take them all....and everything comes crashing down&quot; he said with a grin, swiping the last cup, letting his tablet fall with a loud smack<br />
&quot;I see, so where are these pillars as you put them&quot; Antonio questioned, standing up as he walked over to the window, his eyes scanning the city<br />
&quot;All over, every dark alleyway, every high end plaza, every corporation, even the law, their roots run deep, Kovastov has had years to lay the foundations of his empire&quot;<br />
Antonios eyes narrowed as he weighed his options, risk all out war with a man that controlled everything in the city, or forever be on his leash<br />
&quot;Then I suggest we better get to work digging up these foundations&quot; Antonio said, the stranger looking up at him with a sparkle in their bright blue eyes, amazed by his bold words<br />
&quot;Ok then...friend, my name is Koshi&quot; he said, extending his human hand, Antonio was hesitant as he extended his arm out to grasp his, his hand making contact with Koshi&#39;s, surprised at how delicate and soft it was in his grasp, yet firm and strong<br />
&quot;Antonio, the names Antonio....... Koshi, why do I know that name&quot; Antonio mumbled, looking up as Koshi let out an amused laugh<br />
&quot;Oh you don&#39;t know, Koshi also the name of my life of cybernetic implants, I&#39;ve made Alot of high end equipment, most of which is now in you&quot; he said with a smile, stroking down Antonios Cybernetic arm.<br />
<br />
Antonio was stunned, his eyes wide as he looked at Koshi, THIS guy was the creator of high end cybernetic equipment, and here he was dealing with theaves and criminals like himself and the girls, why not recruit some top of the line mercenaries or hit men to do the job?<br />
&quot;If your so famous and clearly loaded with all this fancy tech, why come to us?&quot; Antonio asked with a curious look on his face<br />
&quot;Because there&#39;s one thing fame and money can&#39;t get you Antonio.... knowledge&quot; he stated, Antonio diverting his attention back to the city<br />
&quot;Ah so you&#39;ve seen it have you, Kovastov&#39;s latest little experiment, devoid of humanity, able to sneak behind enemie lines, and obliterate everything in its path&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;E-8A&quot; Antonio mumbled, Koshi nodding in reply, their conversation interrupted as Mantis and Kat walked down the stairs, their hair wrapped in towels as well as their bodies, both giggling and snickering to each other as they decented<br />
&quot;Oh hey stud, we were just talking about you&quot; Mantis purred, biting her bottom lip and placing a finger on it, the other resting on her tits<br />
&quot;All good things I hope&quot; Antonio chuckled<br />
&quot;Oh trust me, very good things&quot; Kat said with a hum like moan<br />
Antonios curiosities were peaked, gazing at the two towel wrapped women with a lustful hunger, that was until Mantis looked over and noticed him and Koshi by the window<br />
&quot;Oh, did we interrupt anything, you two seemed to be talking about something important&quot; she asked<br />
Antonio shook his head with a smile<br />
&quot;No, me and Mr Koshi here were just discussing our current situation, and I think we&#39;ve reached an understanding&quot; he said, nodding over at Koshi before<br />
&quot;Honestly, can&#39;t go five minutes without causing trouble can you&quot; Mantis chuckled before letting her towel fall to the floor in a heap, leaving her naked body exposed, her soft delicate skin, her firm round breasts, her wide hips swaying as she walked over to him<br />
&quot;Maybe I should make some trouble of my own~&quot; she purred as she reached him, pressing him against the apartment window, pressing her breasts firm against his chest, leaning her hips back as she breathed heavily, Antonio could feel her hands working away at his trousers, desperately trying to pry them off, Antonio looked wide eyed at Koshi, not knowing how to respond to him seeing this situation, but was surprised to see Koshi&#39;s face in full blush, his eyes growing aroused and bright, almost glowing an electric blue<br />
&quot;Awwww does Mr Koshi want some attention too?, I can call one of my girls from downstairs if you-&quot;<br />
&quot;NO!- I mean....no....that won&#39;t be necessary Kat, not necessary at all&quot; Koshi cut Kat off with a dagger like look, Kat grinning from ear to ear at his response<br />
<br />
Antonios attention was diverted as Mantis finally managed to pry Antonios member free from its confines, waisting no time as she began stroking along it&#39;s length<br />
&quot;Oh Fuuuuck&quot; Antonio groaned, feeling his hot blood rushing to his mast, bringing it to rise to attention, now standing ridged and firm in Mantis&#39;s grasp<br />
&quot;Heeh... Good to know our breeding rod here still works after the amount of cyberware you had installed~&quot; Mantis moaned, opening her mouth and sliding her tongue along his length, Antonio groaned as he felt the velvet soft touch of her tongue, soft and wet, like petals after a heavy rain<br />
Antonio looked down at her, their eyes meeting as she slowly took his member into her mouth<br />
&quot;Mmmmmh~&quot; she moaned as she slowly began bobbing her head on his length, slurping and sucking as she went, before releasing it with a satisfying pop<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight....your body and everything with it are ours, we want to feel every inch of you grinding inside us, piercing our wombs and filling us with your seed&quot; she said between gasps, it was between pulses of pleasure that Antonio noticed Koshi and Kat whispering to eachother, seeming to argue, Kat had hold of Koshi&#39;s sash, while Koshi desperately tried to keep his outfit in tact, his face bright red<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Kat, not again, if anyone else knows then there will be no more point with this shit&quot; Koshi whispered, his voice supprisingly elegant and high pitched<br />
&quot;And what would be so wrong with that huh?, your already in the belly of the beast, may as well just join us&quot; Kat chuckled, Koshi seemed to think about this before letting out a sigh in defeat.<br />
<br />
In one fluid motion Koshi grasped hold of the Japanese bun his hair was in, and released it, a river as black as night, made of silk like hair began to glow down his back, long and elegant, his robes falling from his body, his slender frame bare in the rooms light, then he turned around and Antonio was lost for words at what he saw.<br />
A tight binding of fabric was wrapped around his chest, pressing tightly into his skin, carefully Koshi removed the binding, letting it unravel to the ground, then the real shock hit Antonio, it turned out that Koshi wasn&#39;t a he, but a she.<br />
Two delicate breasts blossomed from her chest, her stomach lean and thin, with narrow hips and a small bush above her snow white nether regions, Koshi couldn&#39;t make eye contact with Antonio, her face in a deep blush as she covered herself<br />
&quot;Wait.......but, I- I thought, but you were-&quot; he stammered, unable to find his words, he has no idea how to respond to this discovery, unable to find a way to make any sound.<br />
<br />
Mantis couldn&#39;t help but laugh, her mouth still full of Antonio&#39;s cock, gagging slightly as she laughed, before closing her eyes and continued bobbing her head, Kat and Koshi joining in<br />
&quot;Wait, so you all knew except me, I thought you were a guy!&quot; Antonio said in disbelief, only making their laughter grow<br />
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t make it easy for you, hence the whole point of a disguise, I found that in my line of work, appearing as a man can.....open certain doors&quot; Koshi chuckled as she covered herself back up with her robes<br />
&quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have business to attend to&quot; she said with a smile, tying her hair back once more and placing her facemask and hat back on her head<br />
&quot;Good, because so do we, very important very slutty business~&quot; cat said with a lustful moan, Koshi shook her head as she walked through the front door panel, the door sliding shut behind her as she left<br />
&quot;Now then stud, as far as we know, you haven&#39;t knocked us up yet, so tonight you have two wet cunts to stretch around that fat cock of yours&quot; Kat grinned, Antonio grinning with her as he placed a hand on the back of Mantis&#39;s head, holding her at his base, her throat clenching around his shaft<br />
&quot;Then I guess we better get started&quot;</p>
