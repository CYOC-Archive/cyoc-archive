<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen followed Susan off of the bus and into the school. Some of the crowd of people watching her lingered around, but Susan shot them glares and they quickly dispersed. As Jen walked, she felt as if she had sticky warm cum running down her legs, but every time she looked down, there was nothing at all there. The only physical evidence of what had just happened to her was her own feminine juices staining her panties. <br />
She awkwardly waddled to the first bathroom she spotted, and stood in the stall wondering what to do. She glanced down at the toilet. Sitting down after what had just happened to her seemed like a bad idea. Instead, she pulled down her panties and grabbed some toilet paper. She dabbed at what felt like a drip running down her leg, and found that even though the toilet paper remained dry, it was helping. Relieved, Jen ran the tissue up and down her legs until they felt mostly dry, then moved up to where actual wetness remained. She lightly brushed up against her lower lips and shuddered. She was still sensitive and puffy. She tried her best to clean up without making herself aroused, then flushed the evidence and left the bathroom.<br />
She found Susan at their shared locker, grabbing books out and checking her reflection in a small magnetic mirror. Jen walked over and started to do the same. <br />
&quot;All set?&quot; Susan asked in a teasing voice. <br />
Jen nodded and felt herself blush. Even standing there, she felt hyper-aware of the way her panties rubbed against her pussy. Something was really wrong. She finished pulling notebooks out and putting stuff into the lockers, and Susan finished up shortly after, and slammed it shut. Susan turned to head to their first shared class, Biology. Jen went to follow, but noticed one of her sneakers had come untied. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be there in a second,&quot; She said to Susan and bent down to re-lace her shoe. Susan walked away.<br />
As Jen bent down, as soon as she reached a certain angle where her pussy was facing the lockers, she felt a familiar brush against her pussy lips. She froze. She tried reaching down to her feet, and although she could reach them, found herself unable to lower her wasit any further, as her pussy sat attached to what felt like a similar dick as the bus ride. <br />
Jen tied her shoe, praying it would just go away by the time she went to stand back up, or that because the head wasn&#39;t inside of her yet, she still had a chance to get away. The bell rang and people around her started walking away toward their classes. She tried to stand back up, but found that she couldn&#39;t even change the angle of her pussy, and couldn&#39;t stand up straight. <br />
She gulped and looked around. People appeared to be leaving the halls. This looked ideal, since it seemed she might be there a while. She took a deep breath, and pushed herself back against the cock.<br />
It entered her for the second time that day, and felt no less imposing as the first time. She worked her way down the monster cock, and once again found herself meeting resistance, as if she were still a virgin. If it wasn&#39;t true the first time, it definitely wasn&#39;t by then. She forced herself past that point, wincing in pain, then moaning as the dick slid further into her. She kept pushing back, biting her lip to keep quiet, until she felt her butt hit the cold metal of the lockers. She looked back to see that her skirt didn&#39;t quite go down far enough to protect her rear from the locker. <br />
The last time, she&#39;d had a little trouble figuring out how to get out of this, but this time, she was a little more prepared. She slowly started rocking herself back and forth on the shaft, all while doing her best to keep quiet. She found herself getting wetter, and more worked up so quickly, and moaning loudly before she knew it. She twitched as she felt an orgasm building, and pumped herself quicker on the cock. Almost immediately, she exploded, halting her rocking as the orgasm washed through her and she just groaned. Her pussy twitched around the cock while she tried to recover. After a moment, she wiped some drool from her chin and continued to slide back and forth. She hoped whatever she was doing was the right way to get this thing off. <br />
While she moaned and continued to pump herself back and forth on her phantom pole, she heard footsteps approaching her. Figuring it was a lingering eye from before, she glanced up, and tried to keep herself quiet and just lean on the locker to seem casual. Feeling the cock fill her up to the max as she pressed her ass back against the locker proved too much, though, and she exploded into another orgasm as she watched Kyle Perkins casually approach her. <br />
&quot;How are you doing this morning, Jenifer? Having a bit of a wild ride?&quot; Kyle stopped right in front of her. She bit her lip and straightened up as much as she could. Feeling the huge member inside of her made her buck involuntarily, even as she tried her best to seem like nothing was wrong. She tried to speak, and came out sounding out of breath. <br />
&quot;What do- do you want, nerd?&quot; she was failing to sound like anything more than a sex line operator.<br />
Kyle laughed. &quot;That&#39;s some big talk for a slut like you. You want to say that to me while you&#39;re shish-kabobbed on a huge dick? Taking it in the middle of the hallway?&quot;<br />
Jen groaned. How did everyone know what was happening to her? Was this all some sick prank?<br />
Kyle grabbed her shoulder and pulled her as far away form the line of lockers as she could go, then pushed her back until she was leaning up against them again, and she shuddered. Another orgasm was building, and even though she&#39;d already come so many times, the tension building up made her crazy with desire. She shifted and tried her best to ride it without seeming like that was exactly what she was doing. She just hoped she could manage to come quietly this time. <br />
&quot;I just stopped by to check and see how my transform or dare is treating you, Jen, but it looks like it didn&#39;t even take you to dinner first.&quot; Kyle laughed at his own joke, but Jen found herself coming to the brink. She inched herself back to the lockers, and just as she went to pull back and hoped to bring herself to another orgasm, she felt the phantom cock unload another hefty amount of cum into her. She felt like it was filling her insides up as she leaned there, and once again found that it felt like it was starting to drip down onto her thighs as the feeling of the cock faded away into nothing. She straightened up, but stood rubbing her thighs together. She&#39;d been so close to cumming, and it was almost the only thing on her mind. <br />
&quot;Transform or- or dare?&quot; She asked in a daze.</p>
