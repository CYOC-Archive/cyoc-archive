<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roy wasn&#39;t sure how much time had passed, but he found himself amongst a nest of pillows and tangle of limbs on the floor of Blaise&#39;s room. The three werewolves were human once more, though knotted together, his cock firmly planted in Ty, while Jay had his cock knotted inside Roy. He knew this was going to be something of a common occurrence among them, and actually looked forward to it. There was something about laying here, cuddled amongst his fellows that just felt so right. Ty was humming something to himself, and Jay was stroking Roy&#39;s chest, running his fingers through the curly red hair that now grew there. &quot;Welcome to the pack.&quot; He murmured into Roy&#39;s ear, adding a little nip to the earlobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;The three of you need to untie yourselves and get cleaned up and dressed. You&#39;re on in thirty.&quot; Blaise said from where he lounged on the couch. &quot;First three wolf night show, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be spectacular. Jay, Ty, make sure Roy gets outfitted right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost as if Blaise&#39;s words were enough to cause it. &quot;Roy felt himself soften enough to pull free, even as he felt Jay do the same.&quot; His two brothers collected their performance outfits from where they discarded them, then ushered Roy out of the room quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perform?&quot; Roy said, a bit of nerves touching his voice. &quot;I.. but.. we haven&#39;t practiced.&quot; His voice sounded deeper now, even to his own ears, a touch rough and gravelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just practiced.&quot; Ty said with a laugh. &quot;It&#39;s a night show, we do some lewd dancing for a bit then fuck on stage. Then we transform and do a bit more fucking until its time for Blaise to start his show.&quot; He leaned in, pressing his nose against Roy&#39;s cheek, acting like they&#39;ve been companions for years rather than less than an hour. It was amazing how quickly the other two wolves accepted his presence among them, and Roy had to admit, he felt like he belonged with them himself, something tied the three of them together closer than he had ever felt with his other friends.<br />
<br />
Almost half an hour later he found himself backstage with Ty and Jay, all of them in identical harnesses. Blaise was there, once more a human, his devilish appearance hidden away once more. Tank was on stage, a massive minotaur showing off oiled muscles as he flexed and preened for the audience.<br />
<br />
Roy had to correct himself on one thing. Tank had the biggest cock he had ever seen. The thing flopped lewdly between his massive furred thighs. Roy could barely take his eyes off it. He heard Jay whisper in his ear. &quot;You&#39;ll get a taste, don&#39;t worry. The big guy is insatiable, he especially loves it when Ty and I service him together. Three of us? He&#39;ll be so excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy wanted to blush at the commentary, but instead he found himself eagerly licking his lips just thinking about it. He knew the changes to him were more than skin deep, but even he was a little shocked how much he wanted to play with that massive tool. He was distracted from his thoughts as Blaise came up to him, reaching out to adjust his studded harness with a smile. &quot;Perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt himself blushing at the compliment from his new boss and mentor. &quot;Roy, look out in the audience. Table to the far right.&quot; Roy did as instructed, seeing a tall lanky figure seated at the table drinking a beer. &quot;That&#39;s your friend Ryan, right?&quot; Roy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure you keep him interested and here, I want to use him in my act, as a little welcome to the team present to you.&quot; Roy smiled and nodded, but looked out over the audience again. There was no sign of John anywhere and Roy idly wondered what he had gotten up to.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Ryan didn&#39;t know what had gotten into him. The moment he walked into the theater to see the &#39;Manly Monster Burlesque&#39; he hadn&#39;t been able to convince himself to leave. The minotaur had been fascinating, and so realistic looking. And his.. Well, Ryan didn&#39;t even want to think about that. At least the two women at the table nearby were cute, one in tight jeans and a tube top, the other in daisy dukes and a frilly, tank top. He occasionally looked over to them and grinned, earning a easy smile in return. Maybe after the show..<br />
<br />
Now he was watching this next act, which had started off as three muscular, hairy men showing off, and now they were lewdly making out with each other on stage to the jeers and cheers of the audience. Ryan even found himself joining in once in a while. He had always thought of himself as completely straight. Not that he had anything against guys who found men attractive. John was obviously bi, he didn&#39;t hide it and Ryan always suspected Roy was gay and had a crush on either him or John, or maybe both. But sitting here, he found he couldn&#39;t tear his gaze off the manly, muscular forms in front of him. In fact, his cock was painfully stiff inside his jeans from the display. Something about the redhead of the trio seemed to pull Ryan&#39;s gaze to him in particular. And he thought the man might be occasionally looking over in his direction, smiling coyly as well. It was probably just his imagination.<br />
<br />
He was beginning to wonder about the monster part, when the first of the three men, the brown haired one somehow turned into a werewolf. Ryan had to admit the effects were amazing, he could barely make out the costume at all. He really wished John or Roy were here to make him feel more comfortable about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
The blond changed into a wolf next, leaving the redhead as the sole human on stage, who looked quite pleased to find himself trapped between the two hulking beasts. But he joined in soon enough, turning into a red furred beast that Ryan found it difficult to look away from. They weren&#39;t even giving the illusion of lewd dancing anymore, the show on stage had devolved into a three-headed canine fuck fest, and the audience were eagerly eating it up. Ryan wanted to be disgusted by the other audience members, but he was as fascinated and hooked as the rest.<br />
<br />
He reached under the table and kneaded his cock through his jeans with his hand. At least until he looked over at another table to see two guys at a table, both looking at him and grinning in an almost predatory way. Strangely, neither of them were completely dressed either. One had nothing on but a tattered pair of jeans that looked a couple sizes too small for him and ready to pop. The other guy had on a pair of short shorts and a frilly tank top just a bit too feminine for her leanly muscled, slightly hairy body. Not that Ryan was judging, at a show like this...<br />
<br />
Oddly, he could have sworn a pair of women had been sitting there when he walked in. He guessed he just hadn&#39;t noticed them leave. Though something about it bugged him. He kept peeking at the pair from the corner of his eye, especially as they began to make out. The one in jeans seemed to finally burst out of them, the tattered denim falling to the ground, leaving him quite naked, and very aroused. Ryan quickly looked back to the stage.<br />
<br />
The three wolves were men again, very naked except for their chest harnesses and were taking a bow. Once more Ryan swore the red head looked right at him and smirked. Then they were leaving the stage. Ryan was about to get up and go, deciding he had enough of this place and should find John. But the next act strode out onto stage and Ryan froze.<br />
<br />
He was simply the most attractive man he had ever seen. Even he admitted his supposed straight card would make an exception for him. He was also dressed like a lewd magician. He wore a tight pair of leather pants that left basically nothing to the imagination and a pair of matching knee boots. A black cape settled about his shoulders but his chest was otherwise bare, showing off perfectly tanned skin and well groomed auburn chest hair. His red-brown locks were perfectly coiffed below a fancy black top hat, and he even had on cuffs and a collar like a certain type of male dancer.<br />
<br />
He walked out on stage and spread his arms wide and Ryan found himself dropping back into his seat. &quot;Thank you for attending our Manly Monster Burlesque. Give it up for the Cerberus brothers, Jay, Ty and now including their newest member appearing for his first night, the red wolf Roy.&quot; There was excited clapping from all around the theater and even Ryan was joining in. Roy, huh? Weird coincidence, but definitely nothing like his Roy. He&#39;d die before doing any of what those wolves did up on stage, far too mousy and shy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the leader of this little troupe, the incomparable Blaise.&quot; The man spoke with an easy confidence that came just shy of being truly arrogant. He just knew how great he was and happily explained it to people. &quot;This show is all about change, some of you are simply not the same person as walked into this theater, while others have only had their perceptions altered.&quot; He continued, making grandiose gestures towards the audience. &quot;But no one leaves completely untouched, especially once I take the stage.&quot; He added with a smooth, velvety laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you made it to the final act of the evening, I want to peel back the curtain a little, let you glorify the metamorphosis this show offers, the exquisite look at the male form, both beautiful and monstrous, civilized and bestial. And finally, to free your inhibitions until the sun shines on you once more.&quot; He turned on stage, his cloak flaring out around him, &quot;But for this, I need, first, a volunteer.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few hands stretched into the air, some eager, including the naked man the next able over. &quot;A volunteer mostly untouched physically by tonight&#39;s Bacchanal.&quot; A few of the hands went down, including the naked man&#39;s, who earned a commiserating kiss and cuddle from what must be his boyfriend in the frilly top.<br />
<br />
&quot;You.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan didn&#39;t even have to look towards the man on stage to know a finger was pointed right at him. He wanted to shake his head and decline, but one look into those twin black pools he had for eyes and he felt like a mouse facing a snake. He had no choice but to obey, he slowly got to his feet and took one step after another towards the stage. Blaise stepped to the edge and extended his hand down to help Ryan up. He took the hand in his, silken smooth skin but decidedly warm in his palm, and was pulled up on stage, with the easy of a grown man picking up a child. Or a housecat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; He asked easily, motioning Ryan to a spot on the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.. Ryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely name, Ryan. And tell me, what did you think of tonight&#39;s show?&quot; Blaise took a few steps closer, but Ryan found himself pinned to the spot, unable to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was...&quot; Ryan&#39;s head swam. &quot;It was..&quot; He couldn&#39;t come up with an answer, he needed to answer. &quot;I was amazing.&quot; He finally said, earning him a smile from Blaise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Ryan, it&#39;s only starting..&quot;</p>
