<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam was dreaming another wonderful dream.  He was on a soft bed, getting ready to make love to Evelyn.  She approached him from the base of the bed, and slowly moved towards his groin, massaging his legs as she worked her way up his body. He tried to move forward and caress her, but some reason he was stuck, and could not move.  Evelyn didn&#39;t seem to notice or care, and began to lick the area on his groin around his penis.   He responded with an immediate erection, which Evelyn began to lick eagerly and vigorously.  His eyes rolled in ecstasy.  When his vision refocused, he saw that something was wrong.  Evelyn didn&#39;t look human - a long leathery tail stretched from her back, and her face ended in a long snout that was clamped on his penis. He tried to move, to get away, but he was still stuck, and  no matter how hard he struggled, he just couldn&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he woke with a start and a gasp, and saw that Mary Lou was gently massaging his erect penis.  It immediately retracted through Mary Lou&#39;s hands and back into his cloaca, leaving a surprised Mary Lou fondling thin air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, &quot; swore Mary Lou. &quot;So close.  Well, everything can&#39;t be easy, &quot; she said as she rose and stood up. &quot;Time for plan B.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell were you doing, Mary Lou! &quot; yelled Adam.  Mary Lou just ignored him, and began to dig through her satchel.<br />
<br />
Adam tried to sit up, but found that he couldn&#39;t.  Just like in his dream, he was immobilized. He looked to his wrist and ankles, and saw why.  Large rope used by the local fisherman to secure their boats was bound tightly on his wrists and ankles, secured to the ground and the trees near their den.  He was shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Lou, why am I tied up?&quot; said Adam.  The quavering in his voice betrayed the fact that his anger was now being replaced by fear.  But Mary Lou ignored him, and continued her task.  She seemed to be filling several large syringes with an amber liquid from vials in her satchel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Lou, what is going on? I demand that you tell me! &quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou laughed, and turned to him. &quot;Oh, YOU demand?&quot; She leaned over him, bringing her face close to his, holding the syringes in her hand. &quot;I think its just about time you learned who is really in control here. And who will be making the demands.&quot; Suddenly, she stuck one of the large syringes in his thigh. Adam jumped, and struggled to get out of his bonds.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou jumped back and smiled. &quot;A fighter, huh? Good we&#39;ll need that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam stopped struggling, and looked at her eyes with malice.  &quot;What do you mean, Mary Lou?  I have helped you, given you everything you wanted.  What more could you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, have you now? &quot;said Mary Lou,  dripping with sarcasm.  &quot;What could I possibly want? What does every being want? Not to be alone.  Maybe some friends, a companion ........A family, &quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never, &quot; said Adam coldly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you will have much of choice.  I&#39;ve been with several mates, and I know lots of tricks. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to resist me, especially now, &quot; said Mary Lou with a wink.<br />
<br />
Adam looked to his throbbing thigh.  &quot;What was in that vial, Mary Lou?&quot; asked Adam<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t know, being an employee of the zoo and all, &quot;said Mary Lou, feigning surprise. &quot;You see, before I came,  the zoo was struggling.  They needed a big attraction to bring in the fools and their money.  So they bought me.  But they knew that a little boring alligator wouldn&#39;t impress anyone.  No, they need something special, a Monster ,&quot; she said, and grinned evilly.  &quot;So they cooked up this little potion , and gave it to me every month like clockwork.  And sure enough, I grew and grew until I became the beauty you once knew. All that growth was incredibly painful, but a nice little side effect was that it left me very aroused, and very fertile. Must have something to do with all the strange different hormones mixed in there.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Adam&#39;s mouth dropped in shock.  He knew Mary Lou was unique, but he had no idea how she became that way.  He looked at his leg, and feared what effect the combination of  shampoo and experimental growth hormones might have.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou sensed his fear. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear. You won&#39;t be going through it alone.  I&#39;ll be changing, too.  The only difference is, I&#39;ll be taking a bigger dose.  I&#39;m in charge now, and I can&#39;t have some  larger alpha challenging my authority, so I&#39;m going to make sure I&#39;m just a little bit bigger.&quot;  And with that, she jabbed two large syringes in her thigh.  &quot;Damn, &quot; she said with a hiss. &quot; I forgot how much that hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou leaned close and brushed Adam&#39;s snout with her hand.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear.  I&#39;m gonna take good care of my little beta.&quot; Mary Lou straightened up and walked stiffly back to the satchel.  Her leg was really throbbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why, Mary Lou?  Why me? You could have done all this by yourself? &quot; said Adam, sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t listening very well.  I can&#39;t do this alone.  I need a family.  After all their work and expense, do you think those zoo vets would just let me go, slink off into the night? Oh no, they would spend their lifetimes trying to find me and bring me back.  Living in that zoo was torture, a torture I won&#39;t endure again.  Even with my original strength, a single gator would be no match for their resources.  But a family of strong alligators like myself, even a race of alligators like myself.....Well, they would put up a much better fight. Maybe enough even to challenge the whole human race.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam was shocked into silence.  Mary Lou stiffly made her way back to Adam, almost dragging her sore leg, with her hands behind her back. &quot;You see, it&#39;s Spring, and I&#39;m just about to ovulate.  Do you know how many eggs an alligator can lay? About 50 ..... every year.  It won&#39;t be long until we&#39;re a strong race, just a few years, a few generations.  All I need is a seed for my womb. And I like your seed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam gave Mary Lou a look of defiance, then quickly glanced at her satchel.  Mary Lou followed his gaze, then turned back to him and smiled. &quot;Oh, are you thinking of escape? Maybe trying to turn yourself back into a human? Are you looking for this, &quot; she said as she pulled the indigo shampoo bottle from behind her back.  Adam&#39;s eyes grew wide with fear.  &quot;I was hoping to use this myself.  I really don&#39;t like this human form; frankly,  it&#39;s a little disgusting.  I was hoping to find a nice gator out here and use this to return to my old beautiful form.  But alas, we are alone. However, being one third an alligator is better than none, and it looks like I need to teach you a lesson.&quot;  Mary Lou quickly upended the bottle, and poured the entire contents on the soft earth.  She looked directly at Adam, and said, &quot;You are mine, dear.  You always will be, no matter who hard you try to escape.  And you better learn now to always give me what I want.&quot;  She threw the bottle into the tall grass, and then straddled him.  &quot;And what I want now is you.&quot;</p>
