<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will felt himself slowly come out of his sleeping state, he must have been really tired, he didn't wake up once throughout the night. He felt a cool chill run though his body, his crotch felt damp. He shook his head, rubbing his eyes as he sat up. &quot;What the hell?&quot; He sqeaked in his small child's voice. His underwear was soaked and yellow, he also noticed that his clothes seemed a lot bigger on him today than they had yesterday. &quot;Oh no!&quot; He said, thinking the worst as he jumped off the bed in a hurry with a thud, his underwear falling right off his smaller body as he ran to the full length mirror. What he saw confirmed his fears, he was younger, more so than before, the boy that stood before him couldn't have been older than a kindergardner.<br />
 <br />
Megan smiled from outside the hall way, she had heard the thud from Will and had come to inspect. She entered the room, raising a brow trying to act the innocent. &quot;What's the matter honey?&quot; She said, genuinely concerened. She walked over to him, she smiled inwardly, he was such a cute little boy, those blue eyes and that blonde hair just made him so adorable. His cheeks were rounder and she could kiss 'em all day. She pointed to the urine stained underwear. &quot;Looks like you had a little accident last night.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;What age did you get potty trained?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will looked back at her in somewhat of an upset manner. &quot;Funny! It has nothing to do with that. Must have had something to do with my sudden change in size, my bladder couldn't hold it.&quot; The statement sounded comical coming from his new voice. &quot;Dammit, what's happening to me? Why am I getting younger?&quot; He said, his eyes glazing over with emotion.<br />
<br />
Megan smiled slightly, the chronivac must have given Will the emotional state of a five-year-old too, very fragile. She slightly pouted, feeling sad for him in a way, even though she knew this was only temporary. &quot;Aww, don't be sad, we can fix this.&quot; She said walking over to him. &quot;But right now I think someone needs a bath.&quot; She picked him up abruptly, craddling his butt with her arm as his legs and arms wrapped around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan! I can take care of myself! I don't need you to give me a bath.&quot; Will said, feeling his cheeks feel flush with embarassment, the last thing he wanted was for his girlfriend to be touching his immature body. Not to mention he was still unused to the feeling of being picked up, he was used to picking her up. She ignored him, taking him straight to the master bathroom and placing him on the toilet, he felt the coldness from the seat on his bare ass. &quot;Come on Megan, it's not funny anymore.&quot; Will said pleading with her.<br />
<br />
Megan just smiled as she drew the bath for him, feeling the right temperature, she looked over to him as the tub filled. &quot;Relax Will, I'm just having some fun, won't you let me? You'd make me so happy if you just played along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will looked at her gorgeous eyes and he just melted, the word just slipped out. &quot;Fiiinnnee...&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan's smile brightened as she scooted over to him. &quot;Thank you honey.&quot; She said, planting a big kiss on his soft child lips. As she pulled away, she could see that he liked that. &quot;Still a horny guy even with a boy's body.&quot; She winked at him. With a quick swipe she pulled the now oversized shirt over his head, leaving him completely naked on the toilet. She smiled, looking down at his crotch, where once was a proud man's penis now stood a limp pee pee of a boy. She grabbed is prepubescent penis with her thumb and index finger, massaging it slightly. &quot;It's so adorable.&quot; She said, feeling his hairless crotch.<br />
<br />
Will was feeling slightly humiliated, what he had now was nothing compared to what he had yesterday morning. But Megan was actually enjoying this, maybe it excited her in a way, it kinda did him, not that he could do anything about it with his lack of equipment. She picked him up again and put him into the filling tub, the hot water feeling good against his soft skin. As the tub finished filling, she began to wash his body with the bar of soap, lathering up a cloth and going over his entire body.<br />
<br />
Megan smiled as she washed his body, it was kind of fun taking care of a little kid. &quot;Thanks again for playing along, it really means a lot to me...in fact, why don't I join you so you don't feel so self-concious?&quot; She said standing up. She pulled her shirt up over her head, no bra, her breasts gave Will a familiar sight that actually worked to confort him. She threw the shirt into the corner, looking at Will, she could see that he couldn't take his eyes off her breasts. She squeezed them together, giving him a nice show of her nicely sized breasts. She unbuttoned her pants, turning her back to Will, bending over as she pulled her pants down, again no underwear, kicking the pants to the corner, she turned back to Will. &quot;What do you think baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will smiled, seeing his nude girlfriend. &quot;I feel better, if that's what you mean...&quot; She was gorgeous, her body was perfect, hourglass figure, not a bit of fat except in the right places. She sat down in front of him, smiling.<br />
<br />
Megan began washing him once more, washing herself at the same time, after a few moments Will had began returning the favor. She kissed his cheek. &quot;Aww, you're such a good little helper.&quot; After a what seemed like only a few minutes and was actually an hour, the bath was done. They had played with each other, Megan had tickled him a few times, and Will was still trying to be his adult self, but to no avail. She'd finished washing his hair and started draining the water. Standing up she walked over to the towel rack, grabbing one for her, she dried of quickly, then not even bother to cover up, she dried Will off from head to toe. &quot;That's my boy, all squeaky clean.&quot; She said pecking him on the lips again. She wrapped a towel around him, and one around herself.<br />
<br />
Will looked up at her as they walked into the bedroom. &quot;What're we gonna do about my clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan smiled, grabbing something out of the closet, tossing it onto the bed. &quot;I got more of my brother's old clothes, just in case you didn't stop getting younger.&quot; She grabbed the Superman underoos and helped him step into them, then she dressed him up in a cookie monster set of footie pajamas that zipped up in the back. &quot;Aww...I have to take some pictures once I'm done getting dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will shook his head, he felt ridiculous. But at least during the bath he had a good time, maybe it wasn't all bad, he wonder what would happen next though.</p>
