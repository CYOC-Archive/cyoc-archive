<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the break Mei just followed a group of students and entered a classroom, apparently bilology class. Students were chatting away while getting seated and getting their books out. Mei went to the back of the class, thinking about whom to approach next. After all there was a quota to meet. <br />
<br />
Students calmed down when the teacher arrived. Next to him Ty too entered the room. He made his way to the back, with a devious smile on his face. He glanced on Mei&#39;s belly: <br />
&quot;You have not yet met the quota? Well, there are still a couple of hours left.&quot; <br />
The teacher called out to his class: &quot;Get seated please! And quite please!&quot; <br />
There was a lot of rattling of chairs and the sound of books being put on tables, and students calmed down. Class was about to start. <br />
&quot;Today we are going to learn in depth about our bodies!&quot; the teacher said. &quot;How it is used for reproduction and the differences between sexes!&quot; <br />
<br />
A murmur went through the crowd and some students were laughing. <br />
&quot;I am not joking here. You might believe you know everthing about it already, but watching porn and having a quicky in the back of a car is not what&#39;s gonna be in the test for your exam. We are talking science here!&quot;<br />
Ty leaned towards Mei and whispered: &quot;Maybe we should spice things up a bit?&quot;<br />
Mei was scared. Whenever Ty had an idea of &quot;spicing things up&quot; it was usually she who had to suffer (or rather &quot;he&quot; - because getting turned into a woman, and a bimbo-doll at that, as well as having to bear being a part-time futanari bimbo-doll, was what Dustin had to put up with right now. He was not born a futa-bimbo-doll after all!). <br />
<br />
&quot;Mei?&quot; The teacher was addressing her. &quot;Mei? You are in too? This is perfect! Could you come to the front please?&quot;<br />
Mei was hesitating. This wasn&#39;t going as planned. She only wanted to fuck some of the boys during class to increase her fuck-count, but this? <br />
&quot;Mei! I am talking to you! Come to the front please!&quot;<br />
&quot;I think you better be going!&quot; Ty whispered. His evil grin said it all. He would not let her be. He would definitely mess with her. Mei knew it (and her Dustin self inside was scared as hell). <br />
Mei hesitantly moved to the front-desk and waited for further instruction. She had no idea where this was going. <br />
„All right Mei. Please take off your clothes.“ <br />
Mei was hesitating. This was nowhere near how she had planned this. She had initially thought about making some of the boys cum, in order to meet her quota. But she should have known. Ty had his hands in this. There was no way he would let her get away with just making 50 guys cum and then change her back. <br />
„Mei? I told you to take off your clothes!“ The teacher was clearly getting annoyed now, so Mei hesitstantly started to remove her blouse, her shirt, her shoes. She wore no underwear, since Ty had made her wear commando all the time for easy access. <br />
<br />
The teacher opened up his biology book and started to explain: „The ministry of Education and Higher Education has given us new guidelines for sex education. Starting this year, sex-ed will not only be an elementary part of your curriculum, it will be taught interdisciplinary. In other words: what you are going to learn in biology class today will not only be part of your exam, but you will need it in all other subjects, from art class to literature and physical education“ <br />
The class was all silent when this revelation began to sink in. <br />
„Our lessons will include the physiology of the male and female body, the facts and practice of reproduction and sexual transmitted diseases, their most common modes of transmission, their effects and implications down to them as cause of sterility and sexual promiscuity. Our psychology teacher Miss Fletcher will talk you through psychological issues and their effects on seminal emissions, masturbation, and erectile dysfunctions. Your Literature teacher will delve into works of literature starting with Marquis de Sade and your art-teacher will discuss the classic artists up to modern expression and photography in that respect. I am not quite sure about your physical education, but I have heard they have planned something as well. So without further ado: Let’s begin!“ <br />
<br />
The teacher made Mei stand in front of the class like a prop for medical class, pointing out different parts of her body. Explaining the breasts, nipples and left and right atrium, then explaining about breast-sizes and sensitivity down to her hips and explaining how wider hips were more suitable for carrying a child then smaller hips and so forth. Mei could see how minutes were ticking away, time that was essential for her in order to meet her goal of making 50 people cum before school was over. <br />
„Mei, please sit on my desk and spread your legs.“ <br />
Mei did as she was told and the teacher picked up his explanation, pointing out the different aspects of her pussy, pointing out Labia Majora, Labia Minora, pointed to the opening of the vagina. <br />
„If you push the Labiae aside you will come to the uretha, that is positioned slightly above the opening of the vagina, and above it, on top, so to speak, you will find the clitoris.“ <br />
Mei felt completely objectified at this. The teacher touched all her private places, but she failed to get aroused like this. An unusual reaction for an otherwise constantly horny bimbo. <br />
„All right, let me show you the inner organs now!“ <br />
Mei was scared. What was he planning to do? Her inner organs? What? Nevertheless, she was unable to move. The teacher moved his hand over Mei’s hips and mid-section and it became look-through. At the meantime, Ty was standing in the back of the class, grinning. It clearly was his doing. <br />
<br />
„As you can see, following the vagina, there is the uterus clearly visible, with Cervix at the bottom and Myometrium and Endometrium inside. At the top end the oviducts, or Fallobian tubes, lead to the ovaries that are emitting eggs that move down to the uterus for impregnation.“<br />
Mei’s head was buzzing. What was going on? <br />
„Mei, I’d like you to start emitting an egg now. I’d like to demonstrate conception now“<br />
What? What was the teacher talking about? How could she even … there was a slight dragging to be felt, and faster than it should be possible an egg actually was moving down the tube towards her uterus. <br />
„Since this would be far too small for you to see, I have started a transmission of all that is going on in Mei’s uterus to the big screen.“ The teacher was fumbling with a remote controle, the room darkened and the big screen in the front corner of the classroom was turned on. <br />
„The egg and sperms are far too small to be visible, so you will have the general overview on the left side of the screen and the transmission of the electron microscope on the right hand side of the screen.“<br />
Electro microscope? What electro microscope? Mei was about to be loosing it.</p>
