<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There, the order and the explanation are all written,&quot; Molly said from our desk while I remade our bed.<br />
<br />
The two of us had finished our round of newlywed behavior and returned to the standing business of making sure that the reference shots for our &quot;hunting cloths&quot; were done. We ended having to take photos of our other side as well when I noticed some details in Molly's stripes on one side that weren't on the other, but that was handled easily, and did not result in us having sex again.<br />
<br />
We then dressed and set about working on the next task. We both dressed ourselves again and Molly went to take care of writing the order an giving the tailor an explanation for the reference shots. I meanwhile worked to get our bed back in order. As I finished, Molly made her announcement.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you write all that so quickly?&quot; I wondered, &quot;I can barely make anything legible as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was a heavy consequence for Molly and I. Our fingers could still work like fingers, but because of their enlarged size to accommodate additional muscle mass, new tendons, and the fact that our claws were retractable had also changed how our fingers were designed. It gave both Molly and I trouble, as my fumbling with the camera demonstrated earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;More practice, I guess,&quot; Molly shrugged.<br />
<br />
I could only shrug. I then half wondered about how stuff like this affected some of the other victims. Particularly those like Miles. If trying to manipulate objects designed for human fingers with almost paw-like hands was frustrating for Molly and I, I was sure it had to be a nightmare for any one of the freak show's victims that was turned into a hoofed animal. I wasn't sure about how those that were turned into invertebrates were affected by these changes. But, I ended up pushing that to the back of my mind as I could do very little about their situations, and at the moment, I was trying to help my wife deal with our own situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to take a look at it?&quot; Molly asked from the seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; I nodded and approached the chair to read over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Molly's explanation read: &quot;Enclosed with the order form are two sets of photographs for your company to use as a reference. My husband and I would like you to make a set of shirts and shorts with our stripe patterns sewn into them. The colors MUST match with a white underbelly, reddish-orange sides and back, with black stripes. It is also important that the designs match our stripe patterns perfectly, and the photos are for you to use as a reference in doing so. The areas that we have censored out do not require as much accuracy and was done to make the photographs as tasteful as we could make them, given our circumstances. For notes on how the stripes on our sides meet with each other, George's go in a solid line from one side to the other. My stripes are in two sections. One comes up one side and angles to a point near the center of my back with the next stripe right next to it, and it goes down my other side. My husband and I greatly appreciate your work and will wait patiently for our order to be made and shipped to us. Molly Rhoer-Wayne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks pretty good,&quot; I commented and hugged her, &quot;Hopefully they'll arrive before the next hunting season.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure they will,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and the company will likely do a very good job... they haven't done a bad job yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded as the tailor that the order form came from had made both of the outfits that Molly and I were wearing.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Not everything in the area was going all that well. Jason Regus, the research assistant for the Flathead County DA's office, was announced as the defending attorney for the two ranchers that Officer Barnes and I arrested on the Friday before the present weekend. And by that Sunday, the first signs of pressure were evident. Letters to the Editor in the Sunday paper, as well as an article that was a half investigation onto the details of the case. <br />
<br />
The article wasn't much more then a couple of paragraphs which was largely the DA's explanation into the official questions. And the official answer was that there was evidence that the two were wrongfully arrested and that the actual criminal was likely the arresting officer. Essentially repeating the rancher's accusation that I had attacked their cattle. This was something that Officer Howard had told me was the most likely result.<br />
<br />
It was the letters to the editor that demonstrated the hornet's nest that Beauregard had likely opened up by hiring the DA's office to defend two ranchers. A couple came in from Columbia Falls, including one by Beauregard himself, which congratulated the DA's office for &quot;taking such a firm stance in making sure that our government remains small and free of corruption and that the rule of law is not perverted by animals looking for what they want to see.&quot; But other then Beauregard's letter, none of the other letters were that favorable for the DA's office.<br />
<br />
Nearly all of the others were critical of him for taking the side of the defendants in the present case. Some were fairly tactful, but there were several that were downright angry. All of them though came from other cities in the county, so I wasn't fully sure how much they would actually repeat their comments when they learned that the entire case was being made to get rid of an animal person. But, the fact that there were so many letters that were filled with &quot;angry&quot; criticisms of the DA, it meant that would be a ton of pressure on him come the next election...<br />
<br />
...And if Beauregard was doing this to give Regus a shot at the office in his own right, he was likely to fail there. Most of the &quot;angry&quot; letters were more aimed at Regus then the DA himself and urged that Regus be fired.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so we descend into the world of mud,&quot; I grumbled as I looked over the paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon, dear?&quot; Molly asked from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of people are already writing in to the paper and criticizing the DA for taking the rancher's case,&quot; I told her, &quot;and several seem fairly mad about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd be mad too,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;The DA's job is to prosecute bad guys... if he thinks the guy's innocent, he'd urge that charges be dropped, and that would be it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're preaching to the choir, Molly,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe this will mean that whoever you guys hire to prosecute will have an advantage,&quot; Molly commented as she came in with two large plates of breakfast for us.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will depend on whether or not the judge believes the evidence we have and whether or not he believes what those two ranchers did is legal,&quot; I told her, &quot;all these letters prove is that what Regus has done is not popular.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll only mean more pressure on Officer Howard as the DA, to defend his subordinate, has declared that I and Officer Barnes are essentially corrupt and that I did commit the attack on the cattle,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and reporters will come snooping around looking for a story to print.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only shook her head, &quot;all because some old rancher wants to be king of the mountain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully we'll be able to beat him in court,&quot; I told her, &quot;and it'll break Beauregard's little movement... hopefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The guess of snooping reporters proved to be one hundred percent accurate. When I made my way into work the next morning, there was a reporter poking around the desk area of the station when I came in. He came right up to me as moved to clock in and begin my day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, you're one of the two officers involved in the arrest of two local ranchers in this area, aren't you?&quot; he asked me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said slowly, looking for some way to get to doing what was my job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell, me sir, uh, what do you think about the DA's comments about the case from last Friday?&quot; he asked me.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's entitled to his opinion, I guess,&quot; I answered, &quot;I think he's wrong, but that doesn't mean he can't have a different opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you comment on the nature of the evidence that you have on the two ranchers then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The evidence we have is convincing,&quot; came Officer Howard's voice from the doorway, &quot;now quit badgering my officers! If you want your story, you'll have to wait for my press conference later today when the lawyer for the prosecution is announced.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reporter slunk back a few steps, but was clearly writing something. I slowly moved toward Officer Howard who seemed to be motioning for me to approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about all that,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;they've been circling like vultures ever since the DA made his statement in defense of Regus's decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did say we were corrupt, sir,&quot; I reminded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is a load of bullshit like you wouldn't believe,&quot; Officer Howard answered with a growl, &quot;I have been called many things in my life, Officer Wayne. Up until this weekend &quot;corrupt&quot; has never been one of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then lead me into his office where Officer Barnes was already waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;The guy asked me the same questions, too,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;Don't worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and waited while Officer Howard moved to sit behind his desk. Once he did so, he sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm sure as you all know, Jason Regus's taking the defendant's case has opened up a big can of worms on everyone, and especially on us,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;as a result, we're going to be playing defensive for making the arrest in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the people that have been protesting have been protesting the DA, not us,&quot; Officer Barnes said confidently, &quot;I think we'll make out okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of those people live outside of Columbia Falls and Kalispell, which will be dealing with the case,&quot; Officer Howard reminded him, &quot;one of them even came from Lincoln County.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your instructions, sir?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly that you'll both have to stay here this morning on &quot;desk duty&quot;,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;that is the bad news. The good news is that we have a young lawyer that will take the case pro bono. I'm supposed to have a press conference at ten to announce him. I want both of you there, and hopefully we can put all this nonsense about the Columbia Falls Police Department being corrupt be put to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is the lawyer?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother, Officer Barnes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey?&quot; Officer Barnes asked, &quot;Little Joey? He's normally done defense work when it's been needed, but most of what he's done is property law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and sounded awfully surprised when I called him, after every other lawyer in town said &quot;no&quot;,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;You'll be alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Joey and I were close growing up,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;I... I... I didn't think we'd ever be involved on the same case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now's your chance,&quot; Officer Howard smiled, &quot;But keep quiet on thus until we go into the shark tank with the reporters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of us nodded.</p>
