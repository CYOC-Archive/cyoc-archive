<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen finished getting dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen and got herself a bowl of cereal for breakfast, this is when she noticed a difference in the size of her head, the spoon she was using was bigger in her mouth than usual, even though it was a tea spoon. She shuddered at the thought of what she was going to do when it was almost the size of her head, but she put that thought out of mind for a while. <br />
<br />
Her mother walked in and started conversation, Jen gave brief answers as usual, but then her mom started asking questions.<br />
<br />
“So, this weekend you Aunt Joan and I are planning to help at church for that pot luck dinner, can you pitch in? I know you&#39;ve got a lot going on so...” Her mom baited her, but Jen wasn&#39;t interested.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, the team and I have some plans to practice, and I have to help Ashley study for our exams.” Jen lied, the team would get together but they would just gossip as usual, and Ashley didn&#39;t need help, Jen did. “I&#39;ve got a full weekend planned, I wasn&#39;t thinking about the pot luck this weekend.” Also lies, she had been thinking of it and planned to avoid it. “You know, busy life of a varsity cheerleader, always busy, always working.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I know, maybe next time.” Her mom said cheerfully, she really didn&#39;t mind, she usually bought what Jen was selling. Her mom turned around and Jen felt the spoon in her mouth suddenly grow larger, she yanked it out as her head began to shrink again, she panicked the food in her mouth seemingly growing as the shrinking continued, she swallowed, staring at the spoon in her hand as it seemingly got a little bigger with each shrink. She shuddered, her and her big mouth, the shrinking continued as she sat there finally feeling it stop, it had shrunk five more times, taking her down to 26 more lies left before her fate was sealed. <br />
<br />
Jen finished her breakfast as her mom left for work, Jen noticed the spoon was now even larger in her mouth, and her hands looked bigger too. She stood up and felt a little off, as if her body were much larger, it occurred to her that Kyle had said that she&#39;d suffer no health problems, but he didn&#39;t say anything about altered perception due to her shrinking senses. She wobbled over to the sink, this wasn&#39;t so bad, just uncoordinated, but how bad would it get later? Jen didn&#39;t want to think about it, but she would have to face it soon. <br />
<br />
Jen walked out to the bus stop, waiting on her bus, she worried about how fast she was changing, but shook that thought away as the bus pulled up. Jen got on the bus and sat in her usual seat, at the next stop her friend Kelly sat next to her and they started talking as usual. Jen chose her words carefully but then they started talking about gossip.<br />
<br />
“Did you hear what happened with Jamie? Jason stood her up!”<br />
<br />
“No! I can&#39;t believe he would do that!” Jen felt her head shrink again, she panicked but needed to keep composure. “Those two are such a good couple,” Another shrink. “I hope they work things out.” Jen felt a third shrink, the curse took things much more literally than she had hoped. Kelly for her part didn&#39;t even notice and continued.<br />
<br />
“Oh please, they fight like crazy. Anyway, I heard that she&#39;s planning on dumping him, but don&#39;t tell her that I told you.”<br />
<br />
“I heard nothing.” Another shrink, Jen screamed inside her head for Kelly to shut up, but she continued.<br />
“Now Denise and Todd, they&#39;re good together, who would have thought a prep and a nerd would be good together?”<br />
<br />
“I wasn&#39;t sure at first,” Another shrink, “But I&#39;m glad they&#39;re happy.” And another, she really didn&#39;t see what Denise saw in Todd, and even tried to tell her he wasn&#39;t right for her, not even in her league. Jen started answering in really short expressions after this, the curse for it&#39;s part didn&#39;t take these for lies and left her be.<br />
<br />
The bus pulled up to the school and Jen got up and felt her balance had changed greatly this time, she wobbled down the aisle of the bus as she felt her body in a much stranger fashion, how small was her head now? She rushed into the school, nearly tripping twice and made her way into the girls bathroom, turning to the mirror she gasped. Her head was now much smaller than it was this morning, it looked to be the size of a babies head, bolted on her neck which was now longer, and sloped into the base of her head.<br />
<br />
She reached her hands up to her face and felt as they practically engulfed most of her head. “My hands are huge!” She cried and felt her head shrink again. “That wasn&#39;t a lie damn it.” Another shrink. “You can&#39;t do this to me!” She felt a third shrink as she pulled away her hands, continuing to panic. “This isn&#39;t possible! The curse isn&#39;t real! This is a dream! It&#39;s all a dream!” She watched as visibly now her head shrank four more times, she then noticed that her view was changing, she seemed to see things as further away. <br />
<br />
Jen turned, feeling her body as much bulkier, the signals from her smaller brain taking several seconds to reach the much larger body it now communicated with, she felt like she was in slow motion, she stumbled into the stall, her body feeling sluggish and unwieldy. She collapsed against the wall, trying to deal with reality. “I can&#39;t live like this.” Another shrink, she was going to have to, she realized that there was going to be no choice. She shuddered, knowing she was doomed she sat there until she heard the home room bell. Jen was usually not here for home room anyway, so they usually marked her as attending, she had an understanding with her home room teacher, being that she was the cheer squad organizer and all. <br />
<br />
Jen sat for what seemed like ages, and decided that since it was going to happen anyway, she would get it over with, and started going on a lying tangent. Feeling her head and senses shrink and change again and again until a new feeling hit her, her pussy vibrated, sending a massive shock to her head, making it swim. She gathered the courage to get up. The problems with coordination where now scaled up to an extreme, she took her time walking out of the stall, having to be patient for her body to respond to her commands as her normal movements seemed like they took minutes of time, while they actually were at normal rate.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m going to have to get used to that.” She muttered as she walked out of the stall, her vision was off, her depth perception told her that she was possibly hundreds of feet in the air, while she knew she was on the ground, the bathroom looking absolutely massive to her, as if she were standing on a city street, she looked down at her body, her eyes seeing it as if it were yards away from her, she walked over to the mirror and nearly cried, the head on her shoulders ridiculously out of place, as if it had swapped with a Barbie doll. She reached up and put her hand on the back of her head, then started to actually cry, her hand dwarfed her head, fitting it in her palm she closed her hand and it covered her head. Jen shook and cried leaning against the sink for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Luckily no one had entered the restroom, and she collected herself, she gingerly moved her hand to whip her tears with a now massive finger, and noticed that the curse hand some mercy and allowed her to move normally. “At least there&#39;s that.” she muttered, she walked out of the bathroom to make her way to first period. And as she did she noticed several things had instantly changed and a new reality entered her head.</p>
