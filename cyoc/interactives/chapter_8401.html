<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Ryan and Peter Reverse Roles – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
It was the same day Ryan met Peter for the first time, but exactly a week later. Ryan and Peter walked the familiar path from Dustin’s house to the court by the park. This time, however, there was a sense of sadness in the air. Ryan realized that this could have been the last time they played basketball there, because Peter’s summer vacation was almost over and Peter was days away from flying back to Canada.<br />
<br />
They had arrived early; none of the other kids were there yet. And of course, Ryan looked completely different from a week before! He was no longer the 4’8”, skinny 9 year-old black boy, but a 10’6” muscular giant! He could now walk up to the hoop and dunk a basketball without even having to jump! Peter and Ryan were talking about what was going to happen to them within the next few days.<br />
<br />
“Do you really have to go back to Canada? I mean, isn’t there any way at all for you to stay here?” Ryan asked Peter. “I have friends and family in Canada,” Peter explained to his much bigger “little” brother, “And my parents live there too!” he continued. Ryan wanted to look for a way that would let them stay with Ty and Dustin. “Would your parents allow you to move here and live with Ty and Dustin permanently?” he asked his shorter “big” brother. Peter thought about it for a moment.<br />
<br />
“To tell you the truth,” Peter explained, “They wouldn’t mind it at all. They completely supported me when I decided to come here to visit cousin Ty and they thought it was wonderful that I got to spend the summer here with Ty and Dustin. I’m a straight-“A” student in school, and it would be relatively easy for me to live here for awhile, even if I decide to stay here till Christmas.” Ryan pondered it for a minute. “So, what’s the problem, then? Why go back? Why can’t you stay here?”<br />
<br />
“The problem is not my parents.” Peter replied, “The problem is with me. I just don’t know right now what I want to do next, but I need to make a decision on this very soon. Part of me wants to go back to Canada, and there is a part of me that wants to stay here. I talked to my parents, and they have no problem with letting me stay here with Ty and Dustin. They know that they are family and that it is just the two of them, so I would be able to help them out by staying here with them. I’m just not sure I want to do that. I mean, this has been the most fun summer vacation I’ve ever had! But do I want to stay here permanently? I don’t know that for sure!”<br />
<br />
When they were standing in front of the basket, Ryan held the ball, and turned towards Peter. “What do you want, Peter? You’re always helping others with your powers, making other people’s wishes come true. What about you? What are your wishes? Is there anything we can do to help you? Are there any wishes you might have, which we could fulfill? You are always helping others, but maybe this is our turn to help you!” Ryan said to him. He caught Peter by surprise. It had been a long time since anyone had asked him what HE wanted, or what HIS wishes were. Peter had to think.<br />
<br />
“I wish you were a little bigger”, Ryan said. “You made my muscles grow bigger, but who is going to help you grow a little bit? You are always helping others, but when was the last time you allowed someone else to help you?” Peter was left speechless, all he could say was “I don’t know.” Ryan looked at him with a smile on his face. “If I had your powers, I would have used them on you first!” he said. Just at that moment Ty and Dustin had arrived. The other kids had arrived as well, and everyone was astonished when the realized that the biggest man on the court this time was Ryan! They could not believe how much he had grown.<br />
<br />
Dustin and Peter went to play with a couple of other black kids from the neighborhood. Ty wanted to play too, but Ryan pulled him aside and wanted to talk to him first. “Hey Ty, I want to ask you a big favor.” Ty looked up to Ryan with a curious look on his face. “Ty, could you give me the power to change Peter?” he asked him. “Yes, but why? I can do it, too!” Ryan started to explain. “Peter has done so much for me, and so have you. But we have never thought about what Peter’s wishes are. I would like to grow some of his muscles. He is always helping everybody else, but now I want to help him, too!”<br />
<br />
Ty thought about it. “That is very selfless of you, Ryan! You truly care about Peter a lot! I can imagine how hard it must be to have to say goodbye to him, since he is supposed to go back to Canada the day after tomorrow! I would like to see him stay longer, but I can’t decide that for him. However, if you want to give him something, then I can help you out. I can give you the power to transform Peter. Your power will only work on Peter and nobody else, okay?” Ty whispered in Ryan’s ear, as he sat next to the giant kid on the bench by the side of the court.<br />
<br />
“That would be so cool! I want to know what it’s like to grow muscle on somebody. I just want to look at him and pick and choose which muscle will grow, and how big it would get. That would be awesome; I can then give Peter something back!” Ryan said. Ty closed his eyes and concentrated briefly on Ryan. Then he looked at Peter, who was playing basketball. Then he turned to Ryan again, concentrating on the big boy again. He had to use his power to establish an invisible link between Ryan and Peter in order to make this work.<br />
<br />
“There, you’re all set! He’s all yours! You can do to him whatever you want, unless he blocks you. He can also undo your spells, but right now he doesn’t even know that it’s you who is changing him, so it’ll be a cool surprise to him!” Ty said. “Just concentrate on the muscle he has now and just picture it growing in your mind, then wish the change to happen to Peter. “Alright, Ty. Thanks!” Ryan said.<br />
<br />
Peter had just attempted a jump shot. “Let’s add some muscle to the legs…” Ryan thought. Peter’s legs grew thicker, and his calves got much thicker, they were now big and bulging out of the back of his muscular legs. He tried another shot, and this time he jumped almost a foot higher than before. But he was so focused on the game, that he didn’t notice the change to his body yet.<br />
<br />
Ty and Ryan chuckled, for they did noticed the difference right away! “Hey Ty,” Ryan said, “Would I be able to make him taller?” Ty thought for a second, “Yes, you can do that!” Ryan grinned. He wanted to add some muscle first. “I love big biceps!” Ryan said next. Just as Ryan said that, Peter felt a tingle in his forearms. But he was so focused on getting the basketball, he wasn’t aware of the fact that his biceps were suddenly growing larger. They went up to 12”, then 13”, finally 14” when his arms began to look noticeably bigger and thicker. Then he finally caught the ball, he attempted a shot, but it hit the top of the backboard! Peter pulled back and looked at his hands with confusion. He had never missed an easy basket like that before! Why did he shoot it so hard?<br />
<br />
Ryan, Dustin and Ty were screaming! Peter had the look of confusion on his face! He noticed something was wrong but he didn’t realize yet that he had become much stronger. And none of the other players had noticed it yet, for they were all focused on the ball! Of course Ty saw Peter’s muscles grow larger! The boys loved it, because Peter was unaware of who was changing him while he played basketball.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see some abs and some pecs on him!” Ryan said out loud! Peter’s jersey was feeling tight. Actually it was becoming uncomfortable, to the point where he took it off and tossed it to the sideline on the floor! One of the players finally said something to him. “Hey Peter, you’ve been working out huh?” Peter just answered “What?” and had to focus on the game. He passed the ball to another player, but he threw it harder than he meant to. “Hey, Peter! Don’t throw the ball so hard! You almost knocked me over!” Peter looked at him with confusion. And Ryan almost fell off the bench, laughing hard!<br />
<br />
When the game was finally over, Peter was all tired and sweaty. As he walked towards the bench, Ryan made one more wish. When Peter got to the bench, Dustin stood up. Peter, who used to be 5’8” tall, was now seeing 6’0” Dustin eye-to-eye! Peter sensed something weird had happened. All he could say was “Hey Dustin, you’ve shrunk!” He looked completely confused, as Ty and Ryan were getting red with laughter! “What’s going on?” Peter asked them.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you see?” Dustin explained, “You have grown bigger and taller and more muscular!” Peter was shocked, as he looked over his body and noticed his increased muscle and height. He noticed the enlarged pecs, abs, biceps, and his powerful legs! “No wonder my shots were off tonight! I was playing terrible!” he said, as he looked over his biceps and flexed. “Wow, I’m strong! But why did you do this? Ty??” Peter asked.<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t me!! I didn’t do it!” Ty said, for Peter was looking straight at him, and he knew he didn’t want to make Peter angry. Ryan then fixed his sight on Peter, just as Peter turned towards him. But Peter was confused. How did Ryan get the power to change him? Then, suddenly, everyone around him seemed to be shrinking. Peter’s head was rising up higher, as his body started to grow really fast. He had to adjust his stance and spread out his legs, because they seemed to be growing! “What’s going on here? Hey… I’m growing! What the heck is this?” Peter said, as he almost lost his balance due to his increased height.<br />
<br />
When Peter’s growth stopped, he was twice as tall as Dustin! His legs alone were over 6 feet long, so he figured he was now close to 12 feet tall. “Oh my gosh! I’m a giant! Who is doing this to me?” Peter asked. Ryan couldn’t hold it in anymore, and revealed his secret. “It’s me! I decided to make YOU grow, for a change! Ty gave me enough power so that I can make you grow, since you are always making others grow! This is my way of thanking you!”<br />
<br />
Then Ryan got up, but Peter was now taller than the 10ft tall muscleboy. “I’m taller than you now!” Peter teased him. “Oh, let me fix that!” Ryan said, as he concentrated. Peter shrunk two feet shorter, until he was the same height as Ryan. He just grinned when he was able too look Ryan in the eye, and gave the big muscle boy a hug! The two giant boys looked at Dustin and Ty, who were now being dwarfed by the two towering boys. “Guys, I have made a decision. I’m staying with you guys at least until Christmas!” Peter announced to the group. Ryan and Dustin cheered, as Ty gave his huge cousin a hug. “I talked to your parents earlier today”, Dustin said to Peter, “And they had no problem at all with you staying here. They just thought it was wonderful because you will be with family when you stay with us!” “Great!” Peter said “I might go back to Canada to get some things, but I’ll be back in a few days afterwards.”<br />
<br />
Then Ty and Dustin walked home, followed by Peter and Ryan, who were both 10 feet tall. “Can you shrink me back, Ryan?” Peter asked him. “No,” Ryan said, “I only had the power on the court. I can’t do it anymore, you’ll need to do it yourself, or ask Ty. But, can I ask you a favor?” Ryan asked. “Sure, like what?” Peter wondered. “Stay the way you are for a few days? Please? I like you big and muscular, and I love the fact you’re as tall as me!” Ryan responded. Peter thought it over for a minute. “Alright, I’ll stay this way until I go to Canada to get my stuff. I don’t want my friends and parents to freak out on me when they see me on the airport being 10 feet tall!” Peter answered. “Besides, I can never become as big and as muscular as you, Ryan!” Peter laughed, as Ryan lifted him up and carried him into the house.</p>
