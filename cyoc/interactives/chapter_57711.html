<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We'll have something to eat thank you,&quot; I said with a smile. These people were nice <br />
and I wanted to get to finding their daughter as soon as possible. We hadn't eaten yet <br />
though and it would be wise to eat when we could.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wonderful girls,&quot; the woman said with delight. &quot;I'll just go ahead and cook it. If <br />
you need it the bathroom is right down the hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well of course we needed to use the bathroom and so we did. I was the last to use it <br />
and when I came back I noticed that the man was gone. Before I could ask where he <br />
went he came back in with a newspaper in his hands. &quot;They have a picture of the boy <br />
they found in the alley behind Greg's house,&quot; he Said sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;That poor boy,&quot; the woman said shaking her head. I thought she had meant the boy <br />
who died until she said, &quot;To think the police arrested him just because the body was <br />
found in the alley behind his house. It was obviously dumped there and the police <br />
should have seen that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he did say that he found the kid in his house,&quot; the man said shaking his head. <br />
&quot;The kid had been shot and buried. They found a patch of ground under the doghouse <br />
that was recently dug up and he does own a gun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He had a dog so of course the ground would be dug up,&quot; the woman said shaking her <br />
head. &quot;You do know that Andrea went missing. Perhaps whoever dumped the body <br />
also took Andrea and dug up the ground under the doghouse.&quot; She caught site of us <br />
and said, &quot;Oh I'm sorry girls. We shouldn't be discussing this in front of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man had put the newspaper down and Nausikka had been looking at the picture <br />
of the boy who was killed. She looked at me and said, &quot;I saw him when we started our <br />
adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
I frowned at this news. One person from our world had died in this one. His family may <br />
not ever know what happened to him unless he spontaneously went back which I <br />
didn't think would happen. &quot;Do you girls know his name?&quot; the man asked. &quot;The police <br />
are looking for anyone who knew him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know his name I just saw him,&quot; Nausikka said looking down.<br />
<br />
When the rest of us had said we hadn't even seen him the man asked, &quot;Where did you <br />
see him at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know where it was,&quot; Nausikka said sighing. &quot;It was a white room with a lot of <br />
people in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did all those people come from and where did they go?&quot; the woman asked <br />
setting plates with bacon, eggs, sausage, and toast in front of us. &quot;One of them might <br />
know who he is or maybe even did that to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know,&quot; I said before anyone else could say anything. &quot;We went off by <br />
ourselves before talking to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the man said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
We ate breakfast in silence and I saw the man and woman sneaking glances at each <br />
other. It was probably them worried about this Greg but I was getting a little uneasy. <br />
As we finished eating the doorbell rang and the man went to answer it. When he came <br />
back there was a woman with him. She looked kind enough but had the air of <br />
someone official. She smiled at us and said, &quot;Hello girls I'm Mrs. Bailey. I've been told <br />
that you don't have any parents. I'd like you to come with me and we'll find you a new <br />
home. You'll love it at the home where you'll meet many other girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we do have parents,&quot; Dike said looking a bit panicked.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Dike would have gone on but I laid my hand on her's and said, &quot;You know <br />
that we don't Bai.&quot; She looked at me surprised that I had used her original name. I <br />
also noticed that the man and woman were looking at me with knowing smiles on their <br />
faces. They hadn't really believed us and probably came up with an explanation for <br />
what they saw. It doesn't help that me and Dike didn't have our weapons visible. They <br />
appeared when we needed them and Nausikka and Semele's weapons were <br />
disguised.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Dike began.<br />
<br />
&quot;But nothing Bai,&quot; I interrupted her. &quot;We don't know who our father is and our mothers <br />
aren't with us anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem like a nice girl,&quot; Mrs. Bailey said looking at me. &quot;I take it that the four of you <br />
are sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded my head and said, &quot;Our mothers knew that the same guy was our father and <br />
made sure that we knew each other and that we were sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what are your names?&quot; Mrs. Bailey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Lisa Plunkett,&quot; I said. &quot;My sisters are Nancy Boone, Bai Kwan, and Sara Slade.&quot; I <br />
gestured to Nausikka, Dike, and Semele. Each of them seemed surprised that I <br />
introduced them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well could you girls go wait in the living room while I talk to Mr. and Mrs. Seville?&quot; <br />
Mrs. Bailey asked.<br />
<br />
We nodded and picking up our packs we went into the living room. Once we were <br />
there Nausikka whispered, &quot;How did you know the name I wanted to use?&quot; Dike and <br />
Semele also wanted to know how I knew their names.<br />
<br />
Making sure that we weren't going to be overheard I whispered, &quot;I had a dream where <br />
we were on a train and I introduced you to another girl. Since you were going to use <br />
those names I'm guessing that it was a vision of the future. I don't want to say any <br />
more because it might change things. Now remember what I said in the kitchen. We <br />
don't want too many people knowing the truth. I though they were open to it but <br />
humans have the annoying tendency to either ignore things they can't explain or <br />
explain them away with mundane explanations. Anything to avoid disrupting their lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded and then Mrs. Bailey came in saying, &quot;Well we're just about ready <br />
to go. There's just one thing. You have a necklace which belongs to their daughter's <br />
boyfriend and they need to give it to the police so they can hopefully find her.&quot; I took <br />
the medallion out of my pack and handed it to Mrs. Seville. Once I had done that Mrs. <br />
Bailey smiled and said, &quot;Now we're ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
We went out to a van and we were soon on our way to the home. The others seemed <br />
to be following my lead for now without much questioning but they were giving me <br />
glances which said that they weren't sure about this. I wasn't sure about it myself but <br />
we may find more people from our world there. It was a possibility.</p>
