<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s been a week since the kind-looking man invited Dylan, Luke and Ethan to live in his home. It was a very big place like a mansion, with rooms for each boy, several long halls, a big pool and even some stables. Despite the luxury atmosphere around him, Dylan didn&#39;t feel too comfortable with it, so he liked to spend most of his time in the stables, taking care of the horses. Ethan, who was the smaller sibling liked to be with his older brother as much as possible, so he ended up helping Dylan almost all day.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Luke was completely enjoying the new life they got. Playing videogames all day, riding his new bike, watching movies in their private theater and stuff like that. He can&#39;t understand why his brothers weren&#39;t enjoying all this things with him. Cleaning horses sounded like a dumb thing to do to Luke when you have these toys only for you.<br />
<br />
A Sunday morning, Luke woke up very early to swim in the pool before he begins a movie marathon. He noticed that all his swimming trunks were dirty, so he put on a blue speedo that he was avoiding for days. Nobody will watch him anyway, he thought. He was going to the pool when he found out his brothers were already awake. They told him they usually wake up that early and was very strange to see him at that hour. They also giggled a little when they saw him wearing a blue speedo. Luke blushed a little before he ignored their invitation to join them at the stables, but he accepted to take breakfast with them.<br />
<br />
They were eating in the huge dining room when their benefactor appeared. It was very common for Dylan and Ethan to meet him at mornings, but it wasn&#39;t for Luke who almost forgot the man&#39;s face. He joined them in the table while he asked them about their experience until now. What they like to do and what they don&#39;t. Hearing that Dylan and Ethan love being with the horses made him smile. But after hearing Luke&#39;s activities that smile turned a little sinister.<br />
<br />
While the boys were eating, the man told them he had invited a little friend who will join them right now. Then, the doors opened and a very beautiful teenage girl came in. She seemed very delicate, thin and small with porcelain skin and long black hair. She looked at the boys and politely grinned, then she took a seat next to the man. He introduced her as a wealthy girl, daughter of an important CEO who is constantly traveling and moving out. She said she has very few friends and never had a boyfriend, so she hadn&#39;t had any sexual experience either. Hearing that was kinda weird for Dylan and Luke who already knew what that means.<br />
<br />
The man said that she was looking for that special guy and she had came her to get it. Dylan didn&#39;t understand it, that girl seemed way more older than him and he was the eldest brother. Why she was looking for a boyfriend right here? However, before he can make a question, the man asked her if she already knew what she wanted to do and she replied that she does. After hearing Dylan and Ethan&#39;s story with the horses, she asked for a farmer boy. A strong virile guy who can show her a world completely different to the one she was used to. The man smiled and asked her to choose a boy, expecting she will pick Dylan.<br />
<br />
She looked at the three dumbfounded kids and grinned when he noticed the boy wearing just a speedo. She happily told the man that Luke was her choice and she can&#39;t wait to see how he will look after the transformation. After hearing that, Luke asked the man  for answers, why was going on, what she was talking about and what will happen to him. That&#39;s when the man revealed his true nature to the boys, telling them that he is a magician who makes his money from providing teenage girls with their dream men.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you have heard, this lady wants a farmer boy and she has picked you to become the farmer boy of her dreams.&quot; The man said as magic sparkles begin to emanate from his hands. &quot;Don&#39;t worry it won&#39;t be painful and it&#39;s a good thing you don&#39;t have too many clothes on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? I&#39;m not a farmer-type of guy. Dylan is more like that...&quot; Luke tried to protest but he can feel that something was already happening to him. He stood up and noticed that the floor seemed more far from his sight. Was he... growing? He was just about to look closer when he felt his spine crack and pop. He shot up. He seemed to be about 6&#39; 7&quot; tall now! He looked like the kid from Willy Wonka after being stretched out! But that didn&#39;t end there, Luke was feeling something weird on his stomach.<br />
<br />
He looked down to see his baby fat coated belly getting thinner and thinner.It turned into a two pack, four pack, six pack, EIGHT PACK! His abs were shredded! Then Luke looked to his legs. His feet were growing like crazy until they grew to a gigantic size 15 feet and his calves and quads ballooned up with muscle. The speedo was starting to feel uncomfortable as Luke gets sturdy muscled legs. He felt a twisting and tingling in his boyhood. He looked down and noticed his tiny bulge was getting bigger, he can feel his tiny mushroom penis lengthening and getting thicker like a salami. It had to be nearly 8 inches long by now! His balls also grew larger, dropping from his abdomen and hanging low in a very loose scrotum that feels disturbingly bouncy-like to Luke.<br />
<br />
Then came his shoulders. With a crunch, Luke shoulders widened to a huge size and filled with muscle. His arms got so pumped with muscle that he looked like he had been working out for years. Luke&#39;s neck got really thick, and a big adam&#39;s apple popped out of the skin. He was definitely older now and almost unrecognizable except for his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?! Why I&#39;m so big?! Is that my voice? I sound so weird!&quot; Luke said before he started to feel itchy. He looked at his feet as dark brown hair crawled onto his toes. And then his feet. The hair was thick and itchy. His legs were soon coated in thick fur and then onto his balls. Curly, wild pubes burst out around Luke&#39;s penis and all over his big balls too! A lot of pubes even stuck out of the top and sides of his speedo, making a big show of the humongous bulge in the front of the cloth from Luke&#39;s still virgin penis and balls. Then a treasure trail led up through the 8 pack abs and up to his chest. It blossomed there into a matted tangle of brown hair. Luke&#39;s body was covered in so much hair that it was barely noticeable that his skin had become rough and tanned as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, it came the facial changes. Luke&#39;s jaw enlarged and grew a sexy cleft. His nose became long and proud. His eyebrows thickened while his hair swept up from a shaggy position to a sexy high fade. A thick patch of stubble grew on Luke&#39;s prominent chin and neck.<br />
<br />
The transformation was over and before Dylan and the others there was a huge manly guy who looked more like a farmer guy than as Luke. He still can&#39;t believe what had just happened to him and he was focused on check every corner of his new body. He felt so heavy and hairy all of the sudden that he moved awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke, is that really you?&quot; Dylan asked not believing what he just saw. &quot;He is furry like a monkey!&quot; Ethan happily said. &quot;Shut up! Ethan!&quot; Luke replied with his new booming voice trying to hide his actual embarrassment. He didn&#39;t like body hair, so it&#39;s hard to see himself with so much hair that it even comes out of his speedo from every hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, sweetheart. What do you think?&quot; The magician asked the teenage girl. &quot;Are you pleased with the result?&quot;</p>
