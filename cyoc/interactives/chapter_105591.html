<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt had come home around the time his dad had dinner ready. As far as coming home everything was kind of like clockwork. He comes home, eats, plays xbox a little bit, then goes to bed. His little sister who was now 4 didn&#39;t like his absence much but Matt was pretty found of saying &quot;you&#39;ll get it when your older&quot; to her, hopping when she was older she&#39;d understand what their dad was like. Although Matt couldn&#39;t help but notice his father was beaming this evening. Usually his dad had the same old dissapointed and worn down look on his face. Having a son you hate and having to raise a little girl by yourself will do that to you Matt had assumed. But Matt hadn&#39;t seen his father this happy since he was in peewee football back in elementary school, so what gives?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good Matt your home&quot; his father said. <br />
&quot;Yeah what&#39;s up Mr. Smiley?&quot; Matt joked. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you so happy before&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s just cause before you got here I got off the phone with a training facility for ya boy&quot; Matt&#39;s father said grinning with pride. Matt had a confused look on his face now, what the hell did that statement mean? He wondered. <br />
<br />
Just then there was a loud knock on the door and Matt&#39;s father was all too eager to jump up and answer it. When he opened the door a beefy security-guard-looking guy in a black wife beater was standing there. &quot;Time to go&quot; was all the stone faced brut said. All Matt could do was gulp as the man walked over to him and pulled him up from his chair and forced him out of the house.<br />
***<br />
Bryan had been allowed to leave class early today to go and take the IQ test update. It had only taken him a few hours. Then he went back to his normal classes after that. <br />
<br />
The very next day he got the results back. His score was 140, genius level. It was really amazing he was that high at only 14. The school officially announced that he would start the special intellectual school the very next day. <br />
<br />
The next morning after his score came in he got dressed and ready for school just as he did every morning. But this time a silver/grey bus pulled up and picked him up. The driver was a big burly type of guy you&#39;d expect to be a bouncer at some club. But Bryan didn&#39;t pay much attention to it, as he noticed the bus wasn&#39;t very full only a few students and they all seemed more or less like him. Bryan sat down next to a Spanish looking teen. <br />
&quot;Hi I&#39;m David&quot; he said looking to be maybe a few years older then Bryan but not by much. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m Bryan, so you going to genius school too?&quot; He said joking. <br />
&quot;Yeah it seemed out of nowhere for me though, I wasn&#39;t considered gifted until freshmen year&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;Been my whole life but I&#39;ve never been out of public school before&quot; Bryan said sounding a little nervous.<br />
***<br />
Dan had been grabbed from behind and shoved into the van. He wasn&#39;t sure what was going on. It was a bumpy ride and felt like it was taking forever. Dan tried to scream or say something but it seemed that he was gagged by something. He also had a headache and felt dizzy...had he been drugged? <br />
<br />
When the van finally stopped he was pulled out and being brought to a large metal door. It was on what looked like the back of a very large, imposing building. Although it seemed this building had many entrances, but just by the bland unimpressive way it looked he doubted this was the front door, or even a side door.<br />
<br />
 Dan had no way of knowing that on one of the side doors Matt along with several other people on a small transport van were entering the same large building. That side of the building faced a football and track felid as that was the door used for people who were told it was a training camp. And in the main entrance the bus pulled up containing those who had been told it was a special school. Despite coming in different entrances they would eventually be mixed together. It was important to keep them away from each other until they were inside, then it didn&#39;t matter. <br />
<br />
Matt, Bryan, and Dam all entered the building separately, coming from different lives, but their fate would be the same soon.</p>
