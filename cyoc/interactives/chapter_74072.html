<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His dick had shrunk!<br />
<br />
Rick was rock hard, ready to blow, and he felt a bit smaller than normal. Maybe it's the cold, he reasoned. But, even in the cold he was bigger than this. He rubbed harder, hoping that he might get himself to grow back to the size he had been a few seconds ago.<br />
<br />
There was another tingle. &quot;Fuck,&quot; he said as he felt his dick shrink again and slip out of his pumping hand. He looked at it again and was shocked at how bare his crotch looked. Beneath the lotion, he could tell that most of his pubes seemed to have disappeared, and his fully erect dick stood only a narrow three inches long. &quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind raced. How is this possible? he though. My dick can't just shrink. He desperately wracked his brains for an answer. &quot;The lotion,&quot; he said, thinking of the only likely suspect in his shrinkage. It was all over his crotch. He grabbed some tissues and frantically tried to wipe his diminished genitals dry. As he wiped, he felt another tingle.<br />
<br />
He lifted the tissues to see that his penis had gone soft and shrunk again to only about an inch long. His crotch was completely bare, and he could see that his balls had all but disappeared up inside of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; he said. &quot;No, it can't... It's impossible!&quot; He started to whine and look around frantically. He wiped his tiny dick gently trying to dry off any lotion left on it. There was very little sensation in his dick now as compared to before. Just like it had been back when he was... &quot;No,&quot; he said, fighting off the thought. &quot;That's impossible. It's not...&quot; He couldn't say it, but he couldn't deny the thought. It was a boy's dick. A little prepubescent boy's dick.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jim and Tom listened intently the next room over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't hear anything,&quot; said Jim, as he strained his ears. &quot;Do you think it worked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh,&quot; said Tom. &quot;I think I heard him say, 'fuck.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim chuckled. &quot;Oh man, I wonder how small it got.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty small,&quot; said Tom as he held up the balloon. There was only a slight trace of air inside of it. &quot;Release,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
A door opened down the hall and they heard footsteps heading down it.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's going to the bathroom,&quot; said Tom. A door shut. They opened Tom's bedroom door and saw the bathroom door closed with a light shining under the door. They could hear Rick quietly cursing inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to knock on the door,&quot; said Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don't,&quot; said Tom, but not very emphatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm doing it. I want to hear what he says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Tom smiled.<br />
<br />
Jim snuck down the hallway and up to the door in perfect silence. He could hear water running in the bathroom and Rick saying, &quot;Come on. Grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim loudly knocked on the door, and Rick squealed inside. &quot;What the fuck!?&quot; Rick yelled, his voice sounding a bit higher than normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you almost done in there? I got to go,&quot; said Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use another room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know where it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, just go downstairs you dumb fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Jim who headed downstairs. Tom followed and met him at the foot of the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I can't wait to see what he says to Mom and Dad,&quot; said Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think he'll tell them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably, I'd want to see a doctor about something like that if I were him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys sat down and watched some TV. About 10 minutes later, they heard Rick knock on their parent's bedroom door. &quot;Mom,&quot; he said, with a slight squeak in his voice. &quot;Mom, I need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened and a Rick and Tom's bleary-sounding mother replied. &quot;Ricky, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; he started to say. &quot;I have a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door closed upstairs and the boys could hear a loud conversation start up with a lot of gasping and questioning and shouting. &quot;Just what the hell were you doing?&quot; they heard Rick and Tom's father shout. They started to laugh when they heard that.<br />
<br />
Rick followed by his Mom and Dad came downstairs a few minutes later. The pained look on Rick's face was priceless. The boys tried their best to act confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; asked Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ricky's had an... an accident,&quot; said their mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright?&quot; asked Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's fine,&quot; said their dad. &quot;We just need to see a doctor about a little...&quot; He abruptly stopped talking at that word. Rick looked like he had been punched in the gut when his Dad said it. &quot;...problem,&quot; their dad finished.<br />
<br />
Rick and his dad went to the garage and drove off. Tom and Rick's mom just made herself a cup of tea and sat in the kitchen staring off in to space.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, Mom?&quot; Tom asked her, feeling genuinely concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; she said, finally realizing that Tom and Jim were there. &quot;You boys just get some sleep. I'll wait up and see what they find out at the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
They went up to Rick's room leaving his mother to brood in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel kind of bad about your parents,&quot; said Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Rick. &quot;I didn't think about how they would take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to change him back?&quot; asked Jim.</p>
