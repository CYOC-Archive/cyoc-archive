<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The were-SWAT walked into the elementary school. it was a two-story building so it would work for a second location for male were-beasts. it has been reported that a were-beast pussy is very needy during the first night. this causes any were-beast with one to seek out multiple mates. meanwhile, the males can jack off the relief themselves so they do not need more than one mate on the first night.  <br />
<br />
As a result, more males were showing up. given how many herm and female were-beasts were created by this outbreak there will be at least three times if not more of male were-beasts. that being said it would not be long before the aquarium and high school would soon be full. Lincoln raised his hand and stopped. there were three branches from the hall they were in.  <br />
<br />
He sniffed the air, &quot;there is a large amount in the cafeteria and gym areas. I&#39;ll take the gym and Jones you&#39;ll take the cafeteria. we will meet back here to take the second floor. with this, many use the night smokers&quot; Lincoln then went left to the gym. four of his men followed him while Jones went the opposite way.  <br />
<br />
They walked past the office when a humping sound was heard. Lincoln nodded and his were-ape officer kicked the door open. a were-husky was pounding the receptionist&#39;s desk with his pelvis. cum coated the top of it as the were-beast came again. the were-ape officer then shot a dart into the husky&#39;s shoulder and the male collapsed onto the desk.  <br />
<br />
The principal&#39;s office was a mess but no were-beast was seen. moving on they approached the gym. the smell of sex was almost overpowering to the were-SWAT members. thankfully their training kept them from getting too horny. Officer Trevor Smith and a were-jaguar broke the window of the gym doors.  <br />
<br />
They then threw in the night smoke. Their masks filtered out the knockout effects of the special smoke grenades. once the noises stopped and after the thuds stopped Lincoln busted through the doors. he made sure all of the victims were asleep. &quot;poor kids. just imagine, a helping of dessert and then you in the body of an adult were-beasts&quot; his were-Pegasus officer said. the woman then went into the kitchen area to check for any who were awake.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jones approached the open teacher&#39;s break room. the sounds of beastly pleasure were quite loud. inside he saw four were-beasts who might have been the teachers. a were-goose girl was being penetrated by a lanky were-tree frog. her face was pure bliss as she lay on the table.   <br />
<br />
A were-eagle woman was being pushed into the wall as a brown werewolf plunged his cock into her ass. She and the others aimed the were-beasts and fired. three of them went down easily but the werewolf ripped the dart from his shoulder and looked at them with a pissed expression. he charged at him only to have the were-ram of his unit headbutt him into the vending machine. the were-gecko then fired another round along with a were-cow.  <br />
<br />
He stumbled as he got out of the vending machine before passing out. &quot;he must have been a were-beast for a while now&quot; the were gecko approached with caution. &quot;yeah but we still have the cafeteria to handle&quot; the were-cow said. she punched the were-ram as he snickered. apart from the werewolf the rest of the mission went off without a hitch. they then returned to the stairway and saw Lincoln&#39;s team already there.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good work I sent word for the vans to come. once we can clear the upstairs we can use this as a second male location&quot; he said before they began to ascend the stairs. what was once a school for small kids had turned into this. most of those infected here were changed by the tainted sugar or by those who changed. any places that were confirmed with were-beasts could not leave until they were checked out. sadly most of the schools within the area were affected. Lincoln could feel his hatred for the man responsible grow the more victims that showed up.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Randall Mason peeked out the motel window to see what the noise was. he sighed in relief as he just saw a werewolf tackle a teenage girl&#39;s while her boyfriend clutching his wound next to the pool. stripped fur could be seen growing from the man as his face went from pain to pleasure. Randall Mason watched as the were-tiger approached his were-donkey girlfriend and plunged his cock into her eager mouth. closing his shades he cracked open a beer and turned on the TV. Sadly nothing but the emergency broadcast was on. he turned it off with a smile forming on his lips. given the outbreak Randall figured he could escape unnoticed in the morning.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my city&#39;s being infected with were-beasts. look I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the middle of the night. that&#39;s the problem. no don&#39;t you dare transfer me to another branch. wait please...&quot; Beatrice Gray sighed.  <br />
<br />
She leaned back in her chair as the government transferred her. She needed the military here hours ago. however, she just kept getting transferred. if she had to guess even the military were unprepared for such an event. this was no longer a drug it was a pandemic.  <br />
<br />
Most of the west side of the city had been converted to were-beasts. to make matters worse she learned the line was low on night smokers. &quot;Miss Gray you okay?&quot; a feminine voice asked as the door opened. a were-monkey came in wearing clothing. &quot;yes Mary just transferred again&quot; Beatrice stifled a yawn as she looked at the were-monkey. a year ago she was raped by a werewolf.  <br />
<br />
He was later sentenced to jail without bail but still, the damage had been done. Beatrice had passed the were-beast Training Act because of this so those poor souls infected by these drug users could still work. &quot;Mr. Thompson and Mr. Clark are here,&quot; she said. this explained why she had entered the room when Beatrice told her not to disturb her unless it was important. &quot;send them in&quot; Beatrice then saw two men come in. One was a blond man in a police commissioner&#39;s outfit and the other was a ginger man in a doctor&#39;s uniform. &quot;please give me some good news&quot; Beatrice was eager to hear their response.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just got word from our were-SWAT unit. they told me that they managed to secure the were-beasts at the elementary school. it will be used as a second location for the male were-beasts&quot; Commissioner Wilson said. turning her head she saw the less-than-happy face of the doctor. &quot;well?&quot; he rubbed his neck at her question.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We managed to make more night smokers and darts. however still no update on the were-beasts cure or vaccines. We&#39;ve never had such a drug that can change the entire body once night comes until lunar ecstasy came around&quot; Doctor Samson said. Getting out of her chair Beatrice approached the window. &quot;well gentlemen we need a miracle. right now we are only fighting the symptoms. we need something soon&quot; Turning her back she failed to see a large creature be-lining straight for her.  <br />
<br />
Thankfully Mary did and ran. Beatrice was shocked when Mary tackled her to the ground. soon a loud crash came from the shattering window as a seven-foot were-falcon landed right where Beatrice had been standing. he looked at Mary with anger and decided she&#39;d be first. he used his talons to rip the were-monkey&#39;s clothes off. however, he was too aggressive and blood dripped from Mary&#39;s shoulders as he prepared to calm her.  <br />
<br />
Before he could go further he screeched in pain. Wilson stood from where he took cover and held his smoking gun. the were-falcon smirked and charged at the man. Wilson fired another bullet but it did not even slow down the creature. the were-falcon swooped down with his right arm causing some very deep gashes across the commissioner chest.  <br />
<br />
The man drooped his gun in pain as the were-beast grabbed him by the throat. it had deemed this one as an unfit mate. suddenly another much smaller pain was felt in his shoulder. glancing behind him he saw Dr. Samson holding a syringe. suddenly the room began growing dim as drowsiness overtook him. After the were-falcon fell asleep Samson breathed a sigh of relief. he kept a syringe full of night smoke on him just in case of something like this.  <br />
<br />
Doctor Samson then rushed over to Commissioner Wilson. knowing that Mary&#39;s healing is better than a human he chose the one in more danger. however, she soon found himself being dragged into a kiss and pushed back. looking in front of him Samson saw the commissioner&#39;s wounds healing as light brown fur began to spread across his body. Wilson fumbled with his pants as Samson glanced back at the mayor and was shocked to see her plunging a cock into Mary with the latter begging miss gray to stop.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly he was tackled by the commissioner as his body grew. two curved antlers grow from his head as he ripped of the doctors pants. he then plunged his cock into the man&#39;s ass and the doctor knew his fate was sealed. Wilson&#39;s fingernails grew longer as they darkened into miniature hoofs. his feet shifted in stance as his toes morphed into hoofs. all Samson could do was moan as a beak formed on his face. Wilson sniffed the air and shifted positions. he soon found the sweet scent he desired and gripped her booty while pushing his growing muzzle into her new moist pussy.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mary woke up from a daze it was hard to remember what had happened. She remembered seeing something coming towards the window. her tackling Miss Gray and the were-falcon ripping her clothes off. however, if the were-falcon was behind her then why did she feel him licking her pussy in front of her. looking down made her gasp any good feeling she had from the pleasure was soon overcome by the shock and horror she saw.  <br />
<br />
Miss Gray was the one eating up her juices. streaks of blood covered her face. Mary realized her blood must have gotten into her mouth and infected her. The mayor&#39;s body was growing, tearing through her outfit.  <br />
<br />
Brown fur began to cover her as Mary took a step back. this seemed to upset the mayor&#39;s lust-fueled mind. he rose to her rapidly growing height and pushed Mary onto her desk. still a little dizzy from her healing wounds she felt mister gray&#39;s new cock plunged into her. &quot;miss *moan* Gray! st...*moan*&quot; she kept pleading in vain.  <br />
<br />
She could see claws and pads grow from the mayor&#39;s hands and imagined something similar was happening to his feet. his bra finally snapped apart as his chest barreled out. above his large pecs, his neck thickened. Mary could only look as her boss&#39;s head shifted to an ursine appearance. his once-long hair now shrinking into his fur. The nine-foot were-bear roared as he came in her. using the brief window Mary managed to get off the desk with a thud.  <br />
<br />
Turning around she gasped as she saw a were-elk plunging his cock into a were-owl woman. the blond hair gave away who the were-elk was. turning back to the mayor she saw him jacking off with no remorse to those present. grabbing the phone she pressed some numbers. &quot;hello?&quot; the voice of the police captain could be heard. &quot;the line has been breached. the commissioner, doctor Mason, and the mayor have been changed,&quot; she explained calmly not to disturb the three were-beasts that were awake.  <br />
<br />
&quot;that&#39;s not good...&quot; he said before the power went out and the phone went dead. Mary was shocked as an explosion could be heard not far off. the power station for the area had just blown. Mary then ran to the door. opening it revealed an awful sight. Several were-beasts were seen in the hall outside her reception area. a majority were bird variations. backing up she felt someone behind her. &quot;we&#39;re not done doing &#39;business&#39;&quot; Beatrice said as he tackled her again. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Lucy and the lion were now panting as they circled each other. While Lucy had the upper hand the were-lion would not give up and leave. being primitive and charged at the lion. being caught off guard by such a brash act the were-lion was knocked onto his back and Lucy placed his hoof on the lion&#39;s stomach. &quot;leave my house&quot; Lucy said. the lion panted in exhaustion and retorted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is my house you bull&quot;. confused Lucy knelt a little and took a big sniff of the were-lions scent. his eyes widened as the pupils shrank slightly. lifting his hoof off of the were-lion he backed away. &quot;M-Marcus?!&quot; Lucy asked. &quot;how do you know my name? Who are you&quot; Marcus stood up with some effort. his pupils shrinking somewhat as the lust began to die down.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t know it was you. I was hoping you left with the kids or that my mom got my message,&quot; Lucy said. this time Marcus took in her scent. while masculine the were some hints on who the were-bull was. &quot;Lucy?&quot; Marcus said. Lucy could only nod with tears in his eyes. he had feared that this could ruin his marriage especially if Marcus was a male were-beast too.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly he was pulled into Marcus&#39;s arms. &quot;Marcus what...?&quot; he then panted lips on his wife. once it was broken Marcus spoke with a smile &quot;I love who you are not what you look like. Sure this will make things more complicated but I think we could make it work. How about you?&quot; Lucy was stunned.  <br />
<br />
he had heard the only times were-beasts of the same sex were together was when their partners were changed into the same sex as them at night. even then it was a rare sight and more often than not the couples would break up. with a weak smile, Lucy hugged him. Their cocks rubbed against each other as they embraced each other. &quot;thank you&quot; he cried out as tears of joy dropped from his eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;oh come on! Fight some more. The winner gets to mate with me&quot; the were-unicorn sang that last bit. looking over to the source of their fight the two glanced at each other. &quot;say have you gotten some use from that thing&quot; Marcus said with a sinister smile. giving one of his Lucy responses. &quot;While Lucy hasn&#39;t Luke has,&quot; Lucy, or rather Luke said.  <br />
<br />
it was not uncommon for were-beasts to choose a different name for their new forms. it was even more common for those who became herms or changed gender. he then approached the were-unicorn. Marcus followed and jumped on the bed. the last undisturbed object in the room broke sending all three were-beasts on the mattress to the floor. the two males didn&#39;t care as the lust returned. Marcus plunged his cock into Mr. Chen&#39;s ass while Luke plunged his into their mouth. the three-way lasted for a while before they cumed into satisfaction. when they awoke it was the next day.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Lucy woke first and gasped at the sight of the bedroom. clothes spilled from the broken closet and tossed drawers. her vanity was shattered and the curtains were ripped. even their bed was now in pieces. &quot;so it wasn&#39;t a dream&quot; Marcus hugged her from behind.  <br />
<br />
the two kissed before they got up. Marcus had telltale signs of his were-lion form as Lucy looked at him. his body was noticeably more hairy and muscular. the most noticeable change for him was his hair was a lot fuller and longer. its wild appearance made it look similar to the lion&#39;s mane he had in his were-beast form.  <br />
<br />
the two searched through their clothing for some things to wear. &quot;I need to call my mom and ask if the kids are there,&quot; Lucy said. Marcus noticed Mr. Chen was long gone. probably to find more mates after both of them fell asleep. he would need to have a talk with that man next time he sees him. walking out of his destroyed bedroom he saw his shredded clothes and broken frame. picking it up he saw how he looked before he changed along with his family. he sat it down and went to the living room. he then approached Lucy in the living room and saw her frantic expression.  <br />
<br />
She dialed the number again to once again hear the response &quot;I&#39;m sorry. were are experiencing technical difficulties please call at a later time&quot; the automated response said. &quot;can&#39;t get in touch with your mom?&quot; Marcus asked. &quot;no 9-1-1. my phone has no signal but 9-1-1 is supposed to go through regardless&quot; Lucy cried out. shocked by this Marcus went back to the hall and got his phone from his ruined pants. the same was seen as he showed no WiFi or mobile data.  <br />
<br />
even the response for 9-1-1 was the same. looking at the hall lights he was sure he had turned them on before he was attacked the night before. flipping the switch proved his theory correct. the power was out. the cellphone towers provided mobile data so they were out too. he&#39;d seen this once last year during a heatwave and the power stations failed.  <br />
<br />
the outbreak must have done something similar. &quot;the powers out. I don&#39;t know how far but at least until the nearby phone towers&quot; he explained to his wife. &quot;what are we gonna do&quot; Lucy said. she feared for her kids as well as her parents. taking charge Marcus went back to the hall and grabbed the keys from his other pocket. &quot;we&#39;re going to your mom&#39;s house and if they&#39;re not there we&#39;ll keep looking&quot; Marcus put a hand on his wife&#39;s shoulder. &quot;we will find them&quot; the two then left for his car.</p>
