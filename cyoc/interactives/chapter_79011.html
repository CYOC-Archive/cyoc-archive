<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The new woman Katherine made her way toward the library restrooms.  She walked with a feminine gait, and it felt natural to be wearing 4-inch heels.  She marveled at her own body.  She couldn't believe how lucky she was!  As a man she had always wondered what it would be like to be a woman.  Now through some strange magic her dream at come true.  And it felt amazing!<br />
<br />
<br />
She got a thrill when she reached the restrooms, and instead of going straight into the men's restroom, she turned and went through the door marked for women.  Inside she looked around.  Huh?  No couch?  That must be a myth...<br />
<br />
There was no-one inside.  The library restrooms were often empty.  She went over to the mirrors to look at herself...<br />
<br />
<br />
She was gorgeous!  She could hardly believe how beautiful she had become.  She had the face of a goddess!  It was beautifully accentuated by make-up.  Her hair flowed over her head and down her back, tied with dark purple bows.  Her eyes were deep emerald green.  As she moved her face and made gestures, the reflection moved with it, confirming what her eyes told her.  She blinked several times in a row, smiled, frowned, stuck out her tongue, touched her earrings and her nose stud, and stroked her hair.  Everything was real.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; she said.  The feminine voice caught her by surprise.  She had a smooth melodic soprano voice.  She said a few things out loud: &quot;I can't believe this.&quot;  &quot;I'm a woman.&quot;  &quot;There are six-point-oh-two-two times ten-to-the-twenty-third power atoms in a mole.&quot;  &quot;I'm still a nerd I guess.&quot;  &quot;I wonder if I can sing?&quot;  She tried singing a few lines of &quot;Fly Me To The Moon.&quot;  She was pretty good, but probably wouldn't be able to sing professionally.<br />
<br />
She moved on to investigate other things.  She walked back and forth, looking at her reflection in the mirrors.  She naturally walked with a very feminine gait.  Her dress flowed around her legs as she did.  It felt so natural to be wearing a dress.  She stopped and did a few jumping jacks.  Her breasts bounced up and down as she did.  She loved feeling the weight of her breasts on her chest.  The jumping jacks didn't leave her out of breath in the slightest; she was in good physical shape.  Hmm what else...?<br />
<br />
<br />
Katherine knew what she wanted to do, but was afraid that someone would walk in.  Wait!  She was still a staff member here.  Maybe she could work something out... <br />
<br />
She tried remembering things, and her mind was flooded with memories from her new life.  She remembered growing up as a little girl.  She loved playing with Barbie dolls and playing house.  She was competitive, and always wanted to prove that girls can do anything as well as boys.  She remembered that when playing with Barbie dolls she usually had Barbie go on dates with Theresa, not with Ken.  <br />
<br />
Into her teenage years she spent all her time with her female friends, and showed little interest in boys.  She had her first kiss when she was 14 years old, with another girl in class.  It happened in the school restroom.  Later Katherine had her heart broken when she learned that the girl was dating a boy in class.  She claimed that she and Katherine were just &quot;messing around.&quot;  Katherine came out publicly as a lesbian when she was 16.  Nobody was surprised in the slightest.  She was always a good student and got into a good college.  She had several girlfriends in college, but none of them lasted.  And save for a few one-night-stands, she was currently unlucky in love.<br />
<br />
She graduated college early with her chemistry degree and moved on to get a masters and a PHD in biochemistry.  She was involved in several research projects and had taken part in the invention of a type of biodegradable plastic.  This success made her wealthy, but she was never the type to just sit on her ass.  She became a teacher to help young students to become as successful as she was.  Because of her success she was very well respected by her colleagues and was a member of the school board.<br />
<br />
<br />
She thought closer to the present and realized she owned a purse... that's where her school keys would be.  She thought and realized she left her purse out by the desk.  It must have appeared there when she was transformed.  She hurried out of the bathroom to get it, still marveling at how easily she ran in high heels.  She reached the desk and collected her purse from beneath it.  It was ruby red in color with black sequence running in intricate patterns around it.  She effortlessly slid it onto her shoulder and returned to the women's restroom, but not before noticing that the backpack she had put the note in was now gone.<br />
<br />
When Katherine reached the restrooms she stopped to dig her keys out from her purse.  She had a variety of items inside.  Looking through it she found she had a daily planning calendar, fruit flavored bubble gum, a tin of breath mints, a little hand sanitizer, some loose change, an iPhone, earbuds, a few pens of various colors, perfume, hand lotion, an unopened bag of skittles, hairspray, a small water bottle, deodorant, a graphing calculator, a few mechanical pencils, her regular keys (including her house and car keys), a make-up bag containing lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, blush, foundation, and nail polish, a few crumpled receipts, a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, a mirror, chap stick, a hairbrush, her work keys, and her wallet.  <br />
<br />
Opening up her wallet she found 100$ in cash, her checkbook, several credit, debit, and gift cards, and her ID.  She looked her ID, it had her name: Katherine Cecilia Bates, her address, Sex: F, Hair: Red, Ht: 5-9, Wt: 136, DOB: 4-16-1985, and her swirly feminine signature at the bottom.  &quot;Hmm, I guess reality really has changed then,&quot; she said aloud.  She took her work keys from her purse.  She went and opened the nearby janitor's closet and pulled out a little sign that said &quot;restroom closed for cleaning.&quot;  Katherine placed it outside the door of the women's restroom and then closed the door and locked it with her inside.  Now, a little privacy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Katherine walked over to the mirrors and proceeded to remove her dress.  She pulled her arms inside the sleeves and pulled the dress off over her head.  She folded up her dress and placed it on the shelf where she had left her purse.  She stood there in her underwear, admiring her looks.  She was wearing her dark red bra that buoyed up her round breasts, her dark purple bikini-style panties that matched her dark purple hair bows and dark purple high heels.  She had her thigh high stockings that felt silky smooth against her statuesque legs.  She had a body any lesbian would kill for!  <br />
<br />
She reached around her back and unclasped her bra.  She took it off and placed it with her dress.  Her breasts were as gorgeous as the rest of her body.  They were smooth, round, and perky, and large enough to really enjoy cupping them in her hands.  She ran her fingers over their smooth contour, getting tingles and thrills from the touch.  She played with her small, erect nipples, rubbing them and tweaking them.  She felt herself getting wet down below, and could smell her somewhat musky scent.<br />
<br />
She pulled her panties down her legs and stepped out of them, still in her heels.  She did not feel embarrassed at her nakedness at all, and the feeling air over her pussy felt nice.  She admired herself in the mirror.  She was completely hairless, and her smooth pussy showed as an enticing line at the bottom of her torso.  She went inside a stall, put the lid down on the toilet, and sat down...<br />
<br />
<br />
Katherine spread her legs a bit and placed her hand over her femininity.  She rubbed and massaged her feminine lips and it felt wonderful.  Her hand came away wet from her juices, and she sucked it off her fingers, enjoying the taste.  She moved a finger between her labia and felt her vagina.  She moved her finger inside the wet hole and gasped.  She couldn't believe how good it felt.  She moved her finger in and out a bit, and she couldn't help moaning in pleasure.  Then Katherine put her finger on her clitoris.  As soon as she did she felt a sharp wave of pleasure through her lower regions and she suddenly cried out.  How could such pleasure be possible?!  <br />
<br />
Katherine touched and played with her feminine nub, gaining speed and rhythm.  She began building toward climax as she kept rubbing.  She couldn't stop.  She kept going and going and the pleasure kept building and building.  This was way beyond anything she had felt as a man!  &quot;More!&quot; she cried.  And she went more, and more.  Then she felt it: the peak, the climax.  Her body tightened, and her pelvis contracted, and enormous waves of pleasure shot through her body.  The waves repeated, over and over again.  She was lost in ecstasy.  She was biting her finger to keep from shouting out so the whole school would hear her.  The pleasure was incredible... impossible!  Finally, after minutes, which seemed like hours, the pleasure died down to a manageable amount.  Katherine sighed, and relaxed.<br />
<br />
After waiting a few minutes, contemplating how much better sex was as a woman than a man, Katherine got up.  The floor in front of her was soaked, and some juice had run down her leg onto her stockings.  She did her best to use paper towels and water to clean it up.  Then Katherine put her clothes back on, gathered her things, unlocked the door, and put the janitor's sign away.<br />
<br />
<br />
As she walked out of the restroom Katherine was happy.  Very happy, in fact.  Everything was right and good.  Her new female body was amazing, and perfect.  That note had made her dream come true.  She smiled as she was walking out of the library.  As she passed the library's front desk Leah the librarian called to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was the chemistry section up to your standards, Ms. Bates?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine had to stop herself and remember.  She remembered coming into the library as a man to check on the chemistry section.  She decided to just say what she felt:<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything was very good, Leah.  Thanks for asking.  And please, you can just call me Katherine&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, Katherine!&quot; Leah replied.  &quot;Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Katherine had to stop and think again.  As a man he had asked her to dinner, and had been rejected.  Leah had said she &quot;didn't swing that way.&quot;  Now as she searched her female memories she found the truth of her new reality.  Katherine had asked Leah out to dinner, and Leah, being a lesbian, had accepted.  Katherine remembered Leah's words: <br />
<br />
&quot;...What?  How did you know...?  And you...?&quot;  Leah was so flustered.  Katherine had cut in: &quot;Yes Leah, I like women, and I know you do too.  And I think you are very beautiful, and in talking with you I've come to like you.  So what do you say?  Go on a date with me?&quot;  Then Leah had said: &quot;Well, of course!  And, I think you are beautiful too!&quot;  &quot;It's a date then,&quot; Katherine had responded.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this had happened on her way into the library.  With her thoughts collected, Katherine responded to Leah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Leah, I'm looking forward to it!  And hey, I may be wearing something special for later as well, if that's what you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...!&quot; Leah gasped.  &quot;I can't wait, Katherine.  Thanks for asking me, I'll see you tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And with that Katherine returned to her classroom for the rest of the afternoon of teaching.  She was already wet again from thinking about the sexy librarian, Leah.  Her life was perfect, and getting better.  She hoped that everyone who found that note would be as happy as she was.</p>
