<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Because Jennifer hung up before Kyle had finished explaining her transformation, she had no idea how bad her changes would get. As she blissfully crammed snacks into her mouth on the bus, she felt her shirt tightening more and more. Crumbs gathered on what was now a protruding pot belly, which was almost completely exposed. Other kids on the bus stole glances at her odd appearance, noting not just her stomach, but her pointed ears.
<P>Hearing the snickering of a boy across the aisle, she turned her head. The smiling boy's face turned to a horrified expression before he snapped into a normal sitting position, facing straight ahead as if nothing happened. Jennifer shrugged as a few more crumbs of the five cookies she was chewing simultaneously escaped her stuffed mouth. With one hand she brushed them off her stomach, then swallowed her entire mouthful hard in surprise.
<P>With all of her thoughts on eating and getting to school, she had only now noticed her enormous belly. It stuck out nearly a foot from her body. Her skirt had a large rip in its waist. She was so alarmed by this that she screamed aloud. "Oh my God, what is happening?!"
<P>Everyone on the bus looked at her, even the bus driver though his rearview mirror, but he apparently didn't notice her lower body from all the way in the front. Otherwise, he probably would have been too shocked to properly execute the turn into the high school parking lot.
<P>Jennifer didn't care who was staring at her, she just wanted to know why her body was suddenly blowing up to such ugly porportions. As the bus came to a halt, she pushed her way through the oggling students and ran out into the open. Her stomach growled loudly as she looked around for Kyle Perkins.
<P>He did this to her. He made her want to eat, and now she knew the curse was real. Her teeth began to ache for some reason, and she put another cookie into her mouth to quell its pain. She couldn't find Kyle in the crowd, but knew where his locker was. That was where she and her friends had humiliated him the week before.
<P>She stormed down the crowded hall. She moved slower than usual, thanks to her new heft which seemed larger with every step. Her breaths became more difficult as her shirt became increasingly tighter. She spotted Kyle at his open locker and marched right up to him as he was placing books into his backpack.
<P>"Hey, Jennifer," he said nonchalantly. "Hungry?" He pulled out a candy bar from his backpack.
<P>Unable to stop herself, Jennifer snatched the bar and tore into its package, gobbling down the gooey chocolate and caramel. She was partly thankful because her teeth had started to ache again, and chewing helped take the pressure off. Her nose sniffled deeply as she did so. It sounded strangely deep and nasaly, but she couldn't be bothered by that now.
<P>"You made me eat," she said after swallowing the candy bar. "You made me FAT!" Already her stomach seemed to be finished with the candy, as she could feel it gurgle restlessly again.
<P>"I did more than that," he smiled. "You hung up before I could get to the best part. Good thing the curse still works even if its victim doesn't hear all of it."
<P>Trying to ignore her stomach's growls, she tried to understand what Kyle was getting at. "What are you talking about?"
<P>Kyle swung his locker door open farther and pointed to the mirror that was magnetized to it. "See for yourself."
<P>Jennifer's stomach felt upset again, but not for lack of food. This time she felt as if she was going to be sick. Her face had fattened up somewhat, but the more frightening thing was how...inhuman it looked. Her nose had become more rounded and her nostrils were flaring out wider than before. Her teeth were growing four large fangs...or tiny tusks. Her ears were twice their normal size and pointed out at the sides.
<P>"You're more than fat," Kyle teased. "You're a fat PIG!" As Jennifer continued to stare silently at her reflection, Kyle swung the door closed and walked off, whistling defiantly as he headed to class. Fat, pig-like Jennifer stood in the hall, looking after him and trying desperately to wake herself up from a nightmare she knew was all too real.</p>
