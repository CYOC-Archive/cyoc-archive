<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zeke needless to say around about three hours later, during fourth period, he was excited to see what had become of his little test subjects. He wouldn&#39;t lie that he was getting a thrill out of the idea of changing these guys - the half-hard dick in his pants wouldn&#39;t exactly tell an entirely innocuous story. So when he knew they all had the same lunch, Zeke went ahead to where their little clique usually set up for lunch. He&#39;d seen Nate shortly after his little trot out to the bathroom. Seeing him so relieved yet so defeated almost made Zeke chuckle. He could tell just as well his transformation selected had started its work. Nate looked broader, stronger, his clothes tighter on him - Zeke swore he could see every striation in those shoulders!<br />
<br />
But as he went to lunch, picking up some chicken, steak and some beans - a richly protein filled meal - Zeke started looking around for his friends. He wondered what kind of state he&#39;d see Brad and Danny in. As he moved about he didn&#39;t exactly hear very many rumors about them, denying him the sneak preview of what was to come. A mischievous smile came to his face. He knew he could just survey the Chronivac right now and see for himself what had become of them...<br />
<br />
That however seemed like it&#39;d be cheating him of the surprise of the big, in person reveal.<br />
<br />
Zeke wasn&#39;t disappointed when, just as he sat down to start eating, he finally saw Nate making his way to the table. Surrounded by so many senior class girls, many of them very pretty, was obviously not doing Nate a ton of favors in terms of the changes that had been started on him. Amazingly, much to Zeke&#39;s surprise, he hadn&#39;t grown any further so far. Not that making it this far looked like it had been easy on Nate - his shorts were tighter over his ass, and correspondingly, also were tight over his manhood.<br />
<br />
Zeke almost chortled when he realized he could see the vague outline of it through those tight-ass shorts.<br />
<br />
He kind of wondered when Nate might get a little too big for his clothes. They looked strained, but also looked like they could handle a bit more. Zeke was also able to see Nate was visibly grinding his teeth together, trying to fight off the sheer horniness - which if anything seemed amplified further by the growth he experienced. Nate probably, Zeke guessed, found the muscle he put on very hot as a notion - so thus every time he&#39;d grow, he&#39;d only get hotter under the collar.<br />
<br />
An unexpected but welcome side effect, Zeke decided.<br />
<br />
He noted that Nate had a plate full of steak and vegetables, and as he sat he almost seemed to lose his grip briefly, his hand almost moving toward his groin before he stopped himself. Nate breathed and seemed to try to keep himself under control just sitting there. The thought was probably going through his mind - can I stop myself, with so many attractive people around?<br />
<br />
Zeke moved closer to Nate, asking, &quot;Hey man, how&#39;s your day going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Testing. Today&#39;s...testing.&quot; Nate answered, managing to smile and show his usual rather friendly self. He figured he could just focus on conversation and not worry about his libidinous tendencies. He swore that as bad as it was lately, his eighteen year old hormones, they had become even worse today.<br />
<br />
Not that he knew he was seated across from the one responsible for his hormonal problems.<br />
<br />
Zeke stated, &quot;Well, I feel pretty comfortable now talking about the girl I had in my bed last night. I mean, I figure you three wanted to hear...&quot; Zeke knew what this was going to do.<br />
<br />
Nate gripped his knees suddenly, his chest tensing, and he let out a strained breath, &quot;You...You uhh, you sure...? You wanna...t-talk about that? I mean, I&#39;m...really feeling totally t-tested right now.&quot; Nate barely stopped himself from bucking his hips at the mental image. Zeke swore he could see Nate&#39;s nipples standing out through his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I mean, no harm in it, right?&quot; Zeke answered, watching Nate&#39;s face go a little pale. He was trying his very hardest to stop himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know Becky Lin, the girl from varsity cheer squad? Big breasts, bright red lip gloss, long curly red hair?&quot; Zeke stated, and he could tell Nate was steps away from cumming all over himself. He was frantically breathing, trying to keep control in the face of his overwhelming arousal. He was eyeing the exit, trying to keep himself from rushing out to the nearby bathroom to jerk off yet again - and thus fail in this &quot;test&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yet even staying there, Nate risked just cumming then and there. He shivered from the sheer arousal, muscles flexing involuntarily and twitching with aroused need. Nate felt his ass flex now too, and swore to himself as his sphincter seemed to clench momentarily. &quot;Cmon...cmon man, don&#39;t do this to me. I&#39;m...I&#39;m...!&quot; Nate sounded desperate now. Zeke backed off, deciding to let him try and get back from the edge of release.<br />
<br />
And precisely then, as Nate was just sitting there dealing with the issue at hand, was when two figures walked into the lunch room.<br />
<br />
Familiar, but distinct in a number of ways. Zeke&#39;s eyes widened when he saw how Brad and Danny looked now. This had definitely been a pretty intensive time for those two...</p>
