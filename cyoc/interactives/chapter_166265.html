<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen decided to ignore her erection. She did it and went to school trying to do everything so that nobody noticed her dick, thankful that it was not too big and was easy to hide under her skirt.<br />
<br />
During the morning classes she had a hard time concentrating, as she couldn&#39;t get her dick out of her mind, which seemed to make it even harder. Jen was already on the edge when the lunch hour bell rang, so she ran out and went as fast as she could to the bathroom, locking herself in a stall.<br />
<br />
Doing as much as possible for anyone to notice what she was doing, Jen lifted her skirt and lowered her panties and started jerking off while saying very quietly &quot;Why do I have to go through this? I shouldn&#39;t be jerking off in the bathroom because I&#39;m a girl, I shouldn&#39;t even have this dick. And why the hell did this dick grew on me? Since when is this possible?&quot; She then started to jerk off harder, as she had to end her erection soon as the first class in the afternoon was going to be physical education by the pool and she didn&#39;t want to be seen with the bulge of a hard cock between her legs.<br />
<br />
In a short time she felt something traveling from her balls and following her cock, this new sensation for her proved to be the orgasm with her coming. She pushed her cock down, shooting her cum into the toilet. When she finished cumming, she realized that she hadn&#39;t lifted the lid off the toilet and had left her cum all over the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe this happened. I made the biggest mess here and I&#39;m still hard. The worst thing is that I have to go to lunch soon or I won&#39;t have anything to eat.&quot; Jen said, got ready, left the bathroom, leaving the dirt behind.<br />
<br />
After she ate, Jen looked for a reserved place to jerk off again and try to get rid of her erection, but the bathrooms were full and other hiding places she knew were occupied.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t want to go to the pool like that and so she went to the teacher and made up an excuse for not going to class, but the teacher didn&#39;t believe it and said that if she doesn&#39;t show up in class she would be suspended from school.<br />
<br />
She then went to the locker room upset, where she changed doing everything to hide her dick from other girls. But when she was ready she ended up looking at one of her colleagues and started to imagine what it would be like to have her sucking her cock, it made her feel her cock throb, which made her put her bag in front to hide. <br />
<br />
The girl in question was Rebecca, she was a class bombshell with her long straight blond hair, big breasts and a perfect ass. She was talking to her friends while finishing putting on her swimsuit.<br />
<br />
One of Rebecca&#39;s friends noticed Jen and told her &quot;Hey Rebecca, Jen keeps looking at you, maybe she wants something with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to see what she wants, you can go ahead and I&#39;ll meet you there.&quot; Rebecca said and her friends left the locker room while she went to Jen, where she asked &quot;And you Jen, do you want something with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want anything, it&#39;s just your impression.&quot; Jen said, pressing the bag harder to hide her erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you do, I&#39;m sure. Or are you hiding something from me?&quot; Rebecca said<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not hiding anything.&quot; Jen said looking away<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re hiding something from me, let me see what it is.&quot; Rebecca said quickly pulling the bag and almost screaming when she saw Jen&#39;s hard cock, whose shape was easily visible through her swimsuit. &quot;But what is that between your legs?&quot; she asked surprised<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a stick, can you believe it? I don&#39;t know why, but this stick just grew on me earlier today.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;And the way you were looking at me. Don&#39;t tell me you were thinking of using that dick on me.&quot; Rebecca said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was thinking about what it would be like if you sucked my dick.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
Rebecca thought for a few seconds and asked &quot;What would you do if I say that I am willing to suck your dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious, can you?&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I never joke about it.&quot; Rebecca said, then she bent down and put Jen&#39;s cock out of her swimsuit saying &quot;You also won&#39;t be OK in the pool with a hard-on.&quot; and started giving Jen a blowjob right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Rebecca, watch out. The tip is very sensitive.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
Rebecca ignored it and just kept sucking her dick. She also started to caress Jen&#39;s balls and, feeling the wet lips behind she said &quot;How curious, you still have your pussy here.&quot; and sucked her cock again, only now putting two fingers in her pussy.<br />
<br />
Jen started to moan and stopped immediately, looking around to see if no one had heard but only she and Rebecca were still in the dressing room, so she didn&#39;t hold back and continued to moan while Rebecca gave her pleasure.<br />
<br />
Soon Jen felt that he was going to come and said &quot;Rebecca, I&#39;m going to come. Take care not to get dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, you can come until you&#39;re satisfied.&quot; Rebecca said and put Jen&#39;s cock back in her mouth, right when she came. She skillfully swallowed all of Jen&#39;s cum without missing a thing.<br />
<br />
When she finished coming, Jen was satisfied and her dick finally went limp. &quot;Thanks Rebecca, now I think I can hide it better.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
&quot;That was nothing. I actually lik...&quot; Rebecca was saying when she suddenly stopped and looked down, Jen followed her gaze in time to see the bulge that formed in her swimsuit when a dick grew on her too.  &quot;Whatever made your dick grow seems contagious. Now I also have a dick and I&#39;m hard.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re in trouble.&quot; Jen said, so she took Rebecca&#39;s cock and put it out of her swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing Jen?&quot; Rebecca asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just returning the favor. You helped me with my erection so I will help you with yours.&quot; Jen said and then started to suck Rebecca&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aahh. This is strange, but it is also very good.&quot; Rebecca said and started to moan. Then Jen repeated what she had done and put her fingers in her pussy, which was very stimulating for her and she ended up coming very quickly. Jen has also successfully swallowed all her cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really liked to have a dick. I don&#39;t know about you but I think I got sexier now that I have one than before.&quot; Rebecca said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you liked it. I am still afraid of the problems that this can cause if someone finds out.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
With Rebecca&#39;s orgasm over and the two of them already with their flaccid cock, they put their dicks back in their swimsuit. Despite being flaccid, they still left a bulge in their swimsuits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, even with my flabby dick you can still see it in my swimsuit.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea. There are shorts here, if we wear them nobody will see the bulges in our swimsuits. We are already late, but we can say that we had an accident with our swimsuits and that the shots are to hide the holes.&quot; Rebecca said taking some shorts from the soccer team and handing one to Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a great idea.&quot; Jen said, picking up and wearing shorts. Soon after they went to the pool.</p>
