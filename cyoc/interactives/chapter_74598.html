<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan stepped to fetch his backpack, noticing that it’s bottom had been completely saturated with Patrick’s precum as it had covered much of <br />
the surrounding floor. That damn pup! From the backpack he pulled out the chronovac, fortunately only the side was a little moist.<br />
<br />
Dan booted up the laptop, and selected a few little tweaks. He looked at the changes on the photorealistic model of Patrick before selecting the <br />
submit option. This was going to be fun. Rarely before did he feel so powerful. Dan stood back as he massaged his big balls as he watched the <br />
transformation Patrick was undergoing. <br />
<br />
Patrick was feeling uncomfortable, as the cells in his body rapidly multiplied. The last time he had felt like this he was in the restaurant on his <br />
first date with Dan after the competition. He felt himself feel very hot, almost like he was burning in his own skin. Patrick felt dizzy.<br />
<br />
Patrick was stretching, all of his limbs were elongating, the ground was falling further and further away from him. For a moment Patrick <br />
thought this was a delusion, but it wasn’t he was growing! From his already modest nine feet Patrick elongated, ten feet tall.... ten and a half...<br />
<br />
As his bones cracked, morphed and contorted to their new shapes. Patrick’s muscles grew larger, harder, denser. Patrick was inflating like a <br />
balloon. He could no longer maintain the kneeling stance he had, his thighs were getting too wide and thick that they pushed his legs further <br />
and further apart, the same was true of his biceps, becoming so engorged that his range of motion was significantly limited. They must have <br />
been at least 50 inches in diameter, each with firm well defined mounds.<br />
<br />
11 feet.<br />
<br />
Any apprehension Patrick had with his transformation was being overwritten with new data. Patrick felt a supreme calm as his brain rewired <br />
itself, taking the form of his Master’s perfect pup. Patrick would have no other thoughts other than that of his Master. Patrick didn’t have a <br />
history - all he has is an eternal present. His entire sense of himself is based on what he could give his Master. Without his Master he was <br />
nothing, a single second without him would make him hurt dearly. He needed his Master to survive. It was a deeper and more profound love <br />
and admiration pup had ever known. He was his Master’s pup - that is all he is, all he would ever be, all he would ever want to be, all he would <br />
need to be. He trusted his Master to the end of the earth.<br />
<br />
11 and a half feet.<br />
<br />
Patrick’s hair was transforming going from what it was to a much brigher shade of red. This is with the exception of his eyebrows and <br />
eyelashes which remained the most beautiful shade of platinum blonde. That is something that Master would never ever change, well with the <br />
exception of the density. Patrick’s beard grew up to almost under his eyes and connected lightly to his eyebrows, on his torso the red forest of <br />
hair thickened, the hair continuing its march unrelentlessly across his bullish traps, shoulders, each ridge visible with muscle. It continued <br />
down his back and finally covering the two massive mounds of his rump, giving his pup a glossy red fur coating. His beard continued to grow <br />
longer and longer, covering his torso with the thickest and most beautiful beard Dan had ever seen. <br />
<br />
11 and three quarter feet.<br />
<br />
The pigmentation of Patrick’s skin changed as his brand morphed. Originally a single shield motif, the brand became the centrepiece of an <br />
elaborate tattoo which wrapped its around his belly, up his back, across his shoulders and chest and down his arms and legs. The artwork only <br />
served to make Patrick look even bigger and compliment his already gargantuan proportions.<br />
<br />
12 feet.<br />
<br />
His height seemed to plateau. Dan’s fuzzy belly inflated even further, so large that even if he wanted to Patrick himself couldn’t wrap his arms <br />
around it, it was firm and it was perfectly round.  Dan wasn’t done with his pup yet, he still had his coup de gras.<br />
<br />
Patrick shuddered as his cock continued to lengthen itself along the floor, it wasn’t getting hard, quite the opposite, it was getting softer as his <br />
body couldn’t keep up with the amount of blood that it needed. Pup felt a great deal of pleasure as his cock slicked itself along the floor, <br />
lubricated by his own precum. It stayed the same girth, the width of a telephone. He felt as it brushed past the equipment of the gym- it was <br />
hypersensitive. Patrick couldn’t tell but it must have been going on about 18 feet long, adorned with the biggest and heaviest prince albert in <br />
existance. It would be completely useless to use, even in this world,  but of course that was exactly what his Master had in mind. Patrick <br />
thought that Angus had big balls, Patrick was going to find that he was going to put his little brother to shame.<br />
<br />
His balls continued to inflate, growing fuller and fuller with cum, his ballsack stretching itself further and further away from his body. Each <br />
testicle could have easily weighed as much as 300 pounds, and resembled boulders connected to his body.<br />
<br />
Patrick’s last transformation was in sexual drive. Dan turned it up to it’s absolute maximum. Patrick will always want his Master’s cock, always <br />
be begging for it, and will only be satisfied when he has the privilege of having his Master’s precious cum inside him. He would always be blue <br />
balled, always be churning cum. Patrick whimpered, his elongated vocal cords made his tone a deep bellowing bass.<br />
<br />
Patrick’s transformation was complete... for now. Dan looked at his new and improved pup with awe. He had known he had been massaging his <br />
balls at the beginning, but he saw now that he had let out a full load and was still rigidly hard.<br />
<br />
He called for his gargantuan bull pup, it took a lot of getting used to for him to reajust his to another position. His balls and cock dragging <br />
behind him by 18 feet. Even on his all fours he came up to chest height on Dan. His eyes, big and surrounded by the most beautiful blonde <br />
eyelashes looked at his Master’s hand, completely covered in his own cum.<br />
<br />
As an act of grace, Dan offered his hand to his pup, gently and lovingly his pup came closer and licked up every last morsel of his Masters <br />
special seed. Inadvertently he got some of it in his beard, but Dan just thought that was cute. Patrick whimpered gently in gratitude to his <br />
Master, a few tears rolling down his face. At times his pup would be an insufferably horny beast, at other times he was a completely placid and <br />
loving animal. Patrick tried to get himself deeper to kiss Dan’s feet, but his stomach was too large to allow him to get down that low. Patrick <br />
felt very disappointed in himself, he could no longer do one of the things that brought him so much joy in the past. Patrick did as best he could <br />
and kept his head down kissing his Master’s thighs.<br />
<br />
“Patrick. You have a very special purpose now. Now you are my breeding pup, you’ve been especially changed to my perfect ideal of a man and <br />
submissive. Your job is to stay at home, that is where it’s safe and where you belong. Everything else is frightening to you. As my breeding pup <br />
you will take my cock whenever I feel like it. There is an order of things. I, as your Master come first, then my cock comes second, then your <br />
brothers. Do you understand? ”<br />
<br />
Dan’s special breeding pup nodded, and whimpered. From now on Patrick could only muster the most basic of concepts and words. They had <br />
been scrubbed from his mind. Patrick wished he could tell his Master how much these new changes meant to him, how much he wanted to <br />
bring his Master pleasure, to tell his Master how much he loved him, but try as he might, all that could come out was a series of grunts, <br />
whimpers and tones. He would have to demonstrate with his deeds and actions, not his words. All that mattered now was actions, words were <br />
irrelevant. He was already stuttering and struggling in conversations anyway, this just felt more natural to him.<br />
<br />
Dan lifted his pup’s face and looked deep into his Breeding Pup’s big eyes and saw the expression in his eyes, a few tears streaking down his <br />
now even fuzzier face, his eyes said more to his Master than Patrick’s words ever could.<br />
<br />
Patrick saw the sight of his Master’s cock, still standing rigidly hard. A primal urge took over, he needed it like nothing else. He let out a yelp, <br />
wanting so badly just to lick up the precum that was still leaking from his Master’s tip. Just a taste. That’s all he wanted.<br />
<br />
“You want this don’t you? Well... what sort of Master would I be to deny you of the thing you need the most”</p>
