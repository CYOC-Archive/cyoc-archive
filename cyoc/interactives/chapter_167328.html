<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Speaking of which, the same group of five guys who are ogling the girl&#39;s breasts are now your next targets. They all appear to be at least halfway through college. Just the idea of them already scoping out barely legal girls seems scummy to you. You contemplate making them all gay or asexual for a moment. But then you wonder what would happen if you increased their orientation towards women.<br />
<br />
You start with the closest one. He&#39;s wearing a loose-fitting, plain gray shirt, red board shorts, and gray tennis shoes with black socks. His body is remarkably average. His hair is black and cut poorly and really short. It looks like he had done it himself or one of his &quot;bros&quot; did it. He has some unshaven scruff on his face. Maybe it is an attempt at growing a beard. You can&#39;t tell. But he can&#39;t seem to keep his eyes away from the large breasts from the last girl you had changed. You switch the light to &#39;sp&#39; and to a high pink. You shine it on him directly.<br />
<br />
Nothing seems to happen; at least, not at first. His gaze then starts to drift away from the girl. His eyes focus on a woman probably in her mid-thirties walking by. You shut off the light as you hear his friends make joking comments about how he likes older women. He shrugs it off like it&#39;s no big deal to him.<br />
<br />
You then switch the light to &#39;or&#39; and set it to a medium blue. You start at his feet, which begin to get thicker and longer. Moving upward, his calves thicken with muscle and the hair on his legs grows just a little thicker. His quads push out a little, and he sits a little higher in his chairwith his ass getting firmer. You keep going past his crotch and watch as his torso becomes a little thicker and leaner. Pecs just begin to push out his shirt. His arms thicken, as does the hair on them. The hair on his face grows in more to become a decent beard. His hair lengthens a bit, but is curiously still a little disheveled. His face takes on a more rugged look, and his Adam&#39;s apple pushes out more. His voice noticeably deepens to a rich baritone. You then immediately switch the light to a bright pink and shine it on his crotch for a few seconds. Any hint of a bulge in those shorts is gone instantly. You shut off the light and discreetly listen to their conversations some more. His friends don&#39;t even acknowledge a change in him. Neither does he.<br />
<br />
You move on to the next guy. Due to the fact that this food court is technically outside, the blue-eyed blonde has his green shirt rolled up and sticking out of the waistband of his black gym shorts. His hairless yet well built torso is on display for the whole world to see. He also did a better job of keeping up his appearances than the first guy. He is clean-shaven on his chest and face. His hair is a clean and simple buzzcut. And he obviously works out, if the large upper body is any indication. He is clearly the most muscular out of the five of them, even with the slight upgrade the first guy received. Each time one of the girls accidentally glanced his way, he bounced his large pecs and winked at them. They never notice him, or if they did, they make no mention of it. You glance down and stifle a laugh. Clearly this guy only cared about his upper body because his legs were relatively tiny. And he is sporting the grey socks and beige sandals look.<br />
<br />
As mismatched as his physique seems to be naturally, you want to see it pushed further. With the flashlight still on high pink and set to &#39;or&#39;, you begin shining it on his chest. His pecs immediately start to appear softer and plumpier. His nipples grow rounder. His pecs start to stick out further from him and become more breast-like. Before, his pecs could have jokingly filled a pre-teen bra. Now, they were pushing close to B-cups. His chest is still completely exposed, and nobody says anything to him about having basically boobs on full display. You stop shining the light on them when they start to be so heavy that they begin to droop a little towards the ground. You move the light to his legs. They start to get softer, the light dusting of hair pulling inward. His hips and thighs widen, and his ass starts to strain against the now tight gym shorts. His feet shrink and become dainty in the sandals. He crosses his now voluptuous legs in a feminine fashion. You then switch the light to a high blue and shine it on his crotch for several seconds until a thick and massive bulge pushes out in the front of his shorts.<br />
<br />
You switch the flashlight to &#39;in&#39; and to a medium pink, not quite done with this guy yet. You shine it on his sandals. The socks simply vanish into thin air, and the sandals transform into baby blue flats. The male gym shorts shrink up the guy&#39;s thigh and become even tighter around his legs, ass, and dick. A purse appears beside the man. The green shirt still sits in his waistband, but now a tight green training bra materializes out of nowhere and covers his boobs. He&#39;s now wearing female athletic gear on his mostly feminine body, save for his shoulders, back, arms, and head. And yet, he still manages to make flirtatious looks towards the girls, now flexing his arms and showing off his cleavage.<br />
<br />
You shut the light off and set it to &#39;mi&#39; and a high pink. You shine it on him for a moment before quickly changing the flashlight to &#39;sp&#39; and shining on it him briefly, making him still attracted to girls but behaves much like one. Interestingly, the fashion choices of all of the guys improve, and the first guy&#39;s hair is cut much more cleanly. He no longer glances over at the girls but makes comments about them &quot;being cuties and totes adorable&quot;, which is slightly humorous coming from a manly guy&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
The next guy is overweight, clearly having had too many beers and pizza over the course of the past couple years. While his outfit is more stylish, thanks to the previous guy&#39;s change, it doesn&#39;t really do much else for him, nor really hide how much weight he&#39;s carrying. His brown hair is shaggy and long. The glasses on his face are huge, and he only occasionally engages in the talk about various girls he and his friends see or know.<br />
<br />
You keep the light on &#39;mi&#39; and change it to a soft blue. You shine it on him. As time passes, he starts to sit up straighter and engage more with his friends. He starts making jokes and smiling more. He even makes a comment about how his weight is &quot;just more for the ladies to love&quot;. You shut the light off and switch it over to &#39;or&#39;. Keeping the same brightness as before you shine the light on the guy&#39;s stomach.<br />
<br />
To your complete surprise, instead of shrinking, his stomach grows larger. He starts to sit further away from the table as his stomach pushes against his shirt more and more. You shut off the light and try shining it on his arms. As expected, they begin to put on some muscle. You glide back down to the guy&#39;s stomach. His chest and shoulders widen, but his stomach continues to get bigger. It&#39;s nearly the size of a basketball now and looks just as tight. But then his chest starts to catch up with his stomach, pushing out somewhat but not nearly as far.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, you switch the light to &#39;in&#39; and a high pink setting and shine it on his shirt. The shirt lightens from a dark red to a bright pink before shrinking down into a lacy bra for his pecs. You see now that while his stomach doesn&#39;t have abs, it is very taught. You figure that this is what is known as a &quot;musclegut&quot;. The guy seems okay with it. Shining the light on him set at &#39;mi&#39; and a bright blue for a few seconds makes him proud of it.</p>
