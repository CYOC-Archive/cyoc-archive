<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;As Chad headed toward his first class, he heard shouts of &quot;Get furry tail! Get furry tail!&quot;  He turned his head. A dog was chasing a squirrel across the street from the high school.<br />
<br />
Chad wanted to join the chase, but Chad was a good boy. Good boys didn&#39;t chase squirrels or other furry tails unless master told him to chase it. He vaguely almost remembered the fox hunt with Karl and Brad on horseback. The idea of big Brad and Rick, and him chasing a fox while naked and all fours was absurd. Perhaps it had been a dream? Even if it was only a dream, carrying the fox in his mouth to his masters still gave him a chubby. He was a good boy. Chad adjusted his boner. It felt off.  He hurried on to class.<br />
<br />
He went through the motions. He sat up straight took notes.  He glanced at some of the girls in the class, but avoided eye contact and refrained from flirting. He was a good boy now. Besides the girls no longer interested him. He didn&#39;t understand why they no longer interested him. He was content to be Karl&#39;s good boy.<br />
<br />
After his first class, Chad had Study Hall. Karl had told Chad to do what he usually did. He usually spent his study hall period working out in the gym. So he headed to the locker room.  He had stripped down to his dog collar when he discovered that he must&quot;ve left his gym bag in Master Karl&#39;s car, or maybe his last class?<br />
<br />
He never forgot stuff before. Now he couldn&#39;t remember even how to operate a seatbelt. He felt so frustrated, and confused.<br />
<br />
Then a familiar voice barked at him. It literally was a bark. Dog language wasn&#39;t exactly an easy translation to English, but the barks basically registered in Chad&#39;s mind as &quot;Bitchboi, present.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad stood at attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Present. All four feet on ground,&quot; snarled Maximillian, Coach Sanchez&#39; new chihuahua.  Max had been in Chad&#39;s obedience class.<br />
<br />
Brad had thought it hysterical to see the pug doll that &quot;used to be his kid bro Chad&quot; mounted by the much smaller Chihuahua. In his mind it would guarantee Chad would kowtow to the smaller Carl. Pug Chad was Beta to Chihuahua Max. <br />
<br />
The fact that Chad was now human and Max was still a dog didn&#39;t register in the equation as far as Chad or Max were concerned.<br />
<br />
Chad was human, but he presented nsked on his hands and knees with his head erect while the chihuahua inspected him. Max was a bit confused. It smelled like the bitchboi from the school. It was a lot bigger than it had been. But it obeyed his commands. He sniffed it from feet to snout. It looked human but it smelled like bitchboi. When it came to his senses, Max trusted his sense of smell more than sight or touch. Max jammed his nose up Chad&#39;s human cock and balls. It was bitchboi, but it had an empty scrotum before, but the scrotum still smelled like bitchboi but now also smelled like the little balls they played fetch with at obedience school. <br />
<br />
Maximillian went behind Chad, stood on his hind legs, while trying to pull his tiny body up to mount Chad. Chad just presented on all fours waiting for the inevitable. He was a good boy, he reminded himself, and Max was a top dog like Karl and Brutus.<br />
<br />
As Max struggled to mount Chad, his canine DNA triggered Chad&#39;s nanobots. Chad shrank underneath Max as he reverted to pug form. Max yipped happily. This was the bitchboi he smelled and knew. He didn&#39;t notice until after he knotted with pug that the floor beneath Chad was now covered with over 150 pounds of fine sand/dust. Chad stood there with sand up to his chin in a new dirt pile that had moments ago been his human skin, hair, bone, muscle and fat. He was a pug. The nanites even adjusted Chad&#39;s collar to fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
After he unknotted from Chad, Max sauntered away proud of his latest conquest. Chad stood there with Max&#39;s cum leaking out of his ass. Max was happy, so Chad was happy. Chad stood in present position until the first passing bell rang. Chad had to follow Karl&#39;s instructions. Chad had to go in his third period class. Fortunately, Karl was in that class too. Chad looked back at his locker. He pushed the locker door shut. Chad heard the lock click.  He ran on his short pug legs to his classroom.<br />
<br />
People shouted as the pug darted through the school as students traveled between the feet of students going between classes. <br />
<br />
Chad was panting with his tongue hanging out, but he managed to slip through the door with two other students before the final bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who brought this dog to class?&quot; demanded the teacher glaring at Rick and Megan, the students who entered with pug Chad. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not my dog,&quot; Megan protested.<br />
<br />
Rick said, &quot;Not mine,  but it&#39;s wearing a tag. Lemee take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Karl a moment to realize the source of the commotion at the back of the classroom was Chad in canine form.<br />
<br />
He stood and shouted, &quot;Chad present! Sorry, Ms. Chavez, my new dog must&#39;ve followed me to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You named your dog Chad?&quot; Rick asked in a raised voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what? N-n-no. Chad was already the dog&#39;s name when I got him,&quot; Karl stammered.<br />
<br />
Ms. Chavez said, &quot;Collect your dog, Karl, and keep it out of the way. Maybe you can take it home after lunch.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Alright students turn to page 345.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karl was trying to figure out what went wrong. Chad should be human. Maybe when Karl had the tablet out earlier he hadn&#39;t just restored some of Chad&#39;s memories, he must have accidentally switched him to canine mode. Or maybe he messed up the clock triggering Chad&#39;s change?<br />
<br />
Chad sat in Master Karl&#39;s lap, and studiously listened to Ms. Chavez&#39; lecture. He wished he could take notes, but since he couldn&#39;t without fingers, he had to pay attention. He had to be a good boy, good dog, good bitchboi.</p>
