<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: This will begin shortly after Eugene Changes is busted by the police and will follow another one of his <br />
experiments. <br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Ron sat in the hospital, lazily watching as numerous doctors looked over him and took all sorts of samples. He <br />
was extremely weak, a result of the horrible conditions he had spent the past year in while under the care of <br />
Eugene Changes. To a casual viewer, he looked like a massive Great Horned Owl, only the vague human-shaped <br />
body suggest anything different. He had one noticeable difference, his arms ended in talon-like hands instead <br />
of wings, allowing him to at least continue to manipulate things as a human would. His arms were then covered <br />
with long feathers to give him the appearance of wings, but several failed attempts had proven them to be <br />
useless for that purpose. <br />
<br />
Ron had come into contact with Dr. Changes a few months after he had finish college, he had graduated with a <br />
BS in Biology, but the tanked economy had produced very few job opportunities. Dr. Changes had posted a fairly <br />
well-paying position and, with few other opportunities available, he had taken the position in order to help <br />
him buy time until another position came upon him.<br />
<br />
Sufficient to say, things did not go the way he had expected. In retrospect, Changes attitude and demeanour <br />
towards him was now painfully obvious, but at the time he hadn't thought anything of it. He'd often engage him <br />
in discussions about his favourite animals and what his future prospects looks like. Then, out of the blue, <br />
one day Changes had told him there was a way out, a way to guarantee his future without having to worry about <br />
money, about a career.<br />
<br />
Ron had blown him off, but Changes had somehow managed to slip him some of his serum, and before he knew it, <br />
he'd been locked up along with the rest of his 'freak show'. The changes had taken a lot of time to get use to <br />
and even now he was still adjusting to his new body. In particular, he still had a hard time dealing with head <br />
movements, he was unable to move his eyes, like any other owl, so he would have to physically move his head to <br />
look at anything not immediately in front of him. But he was still not use to that and often still tried to <br />
just move his eyes like a normal person and, of course, there was that whole, 'turn his head around' thing <br />
that owls could do that still was so weird for him to do. <br />
<br />
Changes had no taken very good care of him, in particular he was often underfed, leaving him very weak and <br />
barely able to do anything more then just sit there. Had the police not busted Changes' operation, he was <br />
possibly going to die. But now, with plenty of fluids being pumped into him, he was probably going to recover, <br />
though now that brought up the frightening question, &quot;what happens now?&quot;<br />
<br />
He had been missing for over a year now, so long that he didn't even know if his family still thought he was <br />
alive. But beyond that, what was he really going to do now? He was a giant bird, a freak to the rest of the <br />
world. What could he possibly do now? With his imprisonment by Dr. Changes now over, all these question arose <br />
in his head, and he had no idea how to answer any of them. The best hope he had was that Changes had developed <br />
a way to reverse the process, as slim of a chance as it was. Never had he'd seen one of his experiments return <br />
to human form, but that didn't necessarily mean that Changes had never discovered a way to reverse it. <br />
<br />
However, even if he could be changed back, he didn't know if he wanted to. As horrible as the situation was, <br />
Ron could not deny that a part of him enjoyed this new body. He loved owls, he had fantasized about becoming <br />
an owl, and now that he was, he couldn't deny his desire to remain one. Sure, it was quite a challenge to get <br />
use to, but over the course of the past year he had become a bit comfortable with his new body. He could now <br />
see much, much better in the dark, he no longer needed clothing to stay warm, his hearing was greatly <br />
improved, and he couldn't deny that it was kind of cool that he could now look directly behind him. <br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
After about an hour, the doctors finally left him to rest. Ron turned the TV on and quickly changed to the <br />
news, which was now running non-stop coverage of the police discovery of Dr. Changes' operations. Strangely <br />
enough, according to the story, it was Changes that had first contacted the police, claiming someone had <br />
kidnapped one of his volunteers. He didn't remember anything like that happening, but then again, for the <br />
longest time he'd barely been conscious of what was going on around him. He watched the report for about half <br />
and hour, but his weak body finally gave away and he fell asleep without even turning the light off.</p>
