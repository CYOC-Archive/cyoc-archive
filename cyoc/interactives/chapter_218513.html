<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Max is sleeping, something happens in his mind, he does not realize his head softly tingling as his mind is filled with basic dog commands, like heel, sit, stay, down, come, walk and beg. His hearing and sense of smell increase, the boy not realizing his ears twitching when at the sound of an owl coming in from the outside, nor does he notice as he starts sniffing the air.<br />
<br />
When Max’s alarm goes off the next morning, it sounds so deafening loud that it causes the boy to let out a yelp as he jumps out of bed. Max covers his ears and smashes down on his alarm, “f-fuck that was loud,” he says, “I don’t remember setting my alarm THAT loud”.<br />
<br />
After the shock, Max grabs his school uniform: black pants, white shirt, blue and white stripped tie, white socks, black shoes and black suit jacket. He then heads into the bathroom to get ready, after that he heads downstairs, he grabs his lunch box and sniffs at it, without noticing, “yum! Cheese and Sausage sandwich,” he says. The boy then hurries out the front door and towards the bus stop, soon Max is on his way to school, unaware that his day will become really weird.<br />
<br />
Max arrives at school, he walks towards the building and enters, after walking down the long hallway, he reaches his locker. The boy puts his stuff away and only grabs the books he needs for his first period. Max’s ears perk up when he hears footsteps approach him, the boy turns and smiles when he sees his friend Eric walk towards him. Seeing his best friend, Max feels a strange feeling of happiness raise inside of him, he does not notice that he is starting to shake his butt from side to side, but… Eric does.<br />
<br />
“Yo, Max,” Eric says, unable to hold back a grin, “why are you shaking your ass?”<br />
<br />
“Hu,” Max asks, “what do you mean? I am not shaking my ass”.<br />
<br />
Eric tilts his head and raises an eyebrow, he then just shrugs and opens his locker, “man… I am still so exhausted from yesterday,” he says as he grabs his stuff.<br />
<br />
As his friend puts his bag away, Max sniffs the air, “man, did your mom pack you some meatloaf again,” he asks, “why… why do you always get the best grub, and I always get boring sandwiches?”<br />
<br />
Eric turns and looks at Max with raised eyebrows, “how the hell are you able to smell that,” he asks, “but yeah, mom did pack me some”.<br />
<br />
Max does not realize as he starts to drool and lick his lips, “man, Ii wish I could have some,” he says.<br />
<br />
Eric notices Max’s strange behaviour, ‘Max is acting so weird today,’ he thinks to himself, ‘he is acting just like some kind of pooch’. The boy then grins, he opens his bag and takes out his lunch box. He then breaks a piece of meatloaf off and holds it in front of Max, who, when seeing the juicy piece of meet, starts to pant and drool even more. Eric smirks, “how bad do you want it,” he asks, “would you BEG for it?”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Max drops to his knees and holds his hands in front of his chest, looking like a begging dog, even his tongue is hanging out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Eric can’t help but chuckle, “here you go,” he says, throwing the piece of meat into the air, which Max, surprisingly, catches in mid air. Eric grins, “good boy,” he says and pats Max’s head.<br />
<br />
Max blinks, as if awaking from some weird dream, “wh-what the freak,” he says, “what am I doing?!”<br />
<br />
Eric grins, “I have no clue,” he says, “all I know is that you are acting pretty weird and dog-like! Anyway, let’s get to class, don’t worry, I’m not going to tell anyone!”<br />
<br />
Max nods, still embarrassed of what had happened, ‘hope no one saw that,’ he thinks to himself, as he follows his friend to class. The boy is unaware that the whole thing has been witnessed by Carl, a 14 year-old athletic boy with olive skin and black hair, who also happens to be the school’s bully, and who loves to bully Max the most.<br />
<br />
Carl is hiding behind a corner, watching the whole thing, the bully grins to himself, ‘I was planning to head to the shelter to pick a puppy today. But THIS is way better,’ he thinks to himself, ‘hehe… good thing my dad is a vet and I know where he keeps the chips and vaccinations. Hehe… I can’t wait to get my DOG home after school!’<br />
<br />
Max is sitting in class, unaware of the danger he is in, ‘man… what a weird day this is turning out to be,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Carl, meanwhile, is also sitting in class, he is thinking of the best way to get his “puppy”, ‘I know, since I know Max’s habits, and what path he takes in every break, I’ll just wait in the Janitor’s closet,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I know the Janitor won’t be coming until after school is out, and I have cloned the key to the closet. Perfect place to hide my “dog” until I can pick him up after school’.<br />
<br />
When lunchbreak comes around, Carl hurries to the Janitor’s closet and waits for Max, leaving the door a jar, peaking out. He does not have to wait to long, after ten minutes he sees Max slowly approaching, the 13 year-old seems to be alone, ‘perfect,’ Carl thinks to himself. He waits until Max is right by the door, he then opens the door and grabs Max’s arm, pulling him inside with huge force, causing the younger boy to fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
Max is deep in thought as he walks down the hall, suddenly he feels a hand grab and pull him inside a room. The boy lands hard on the floor, “ow! What…,” he starts, but then freezes when he looks up and sees the grinning face of Carl, “C-Carl?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Maxi,” Carl says, closing the door and locking it, “how nice of you to… drop in,” he snickers.<br />
<br />
Max gets to his feet, “wh-what do you want,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“You,” Carl says, grinning, “I want you!”<br />
<br />
“Hu,” Max asks, looking confused, “wh-what do you…,” he starts asking.<br />
<br />
“QUIET,” Carl then says, suddenly Max finds himself unable to speak, the boy’s eyes widen in shock. Carl smirks, “good boy,” he says, “now, let me explain what is going to happen. This morning, I saw you acting weird… dog-like, with you buddy Eric. I was planning to head to the pet store or shelter after school to get myself a puppy”.<br />
<br />
Max does not like the sound of this, the boy shakes his head, “n-no,” he says.<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “I see you understand what I am saying,” he says, “smart pup,” he adds with a chuckle. He smirks at Max, “I always imagined having you be my pet,” he continues, “I never, in my wildest dreams, would thought it would actually happen”.<br />
<br />
“Pl-please Carl,” Max says, “st-stop… stop this BS! I am n-not a dog! I have a family! I am a hu…”.<br />
<br />
“Quiet! I haven’t allowed you to talk,” Carl says, and once again Max feels himself not able to make a sound. Carl smirks, “you’ll make a great dog, Max,” Carl continues, “but, you are to big to be a puppy. I wish you were the same size as an 8 week old pup”.<br />
<br />
Max opens his mouth to tell Carl he is being crazy, but suddenly, too both boys surprise, Max starts to shrink. His clothes start to become loose and baggy, falling all around him, his pants fall to the ground. Max look at Carl, a horrified expression on his face, as he watches the other boy starting to tower more and more over him.<br />
<br />
Carl at first is shocked, but soon the 14 year-old is grinning evilly, “well, I be damned,” he says, “what ever is happening to you, I seem to be able to trigger you to change, hehe! I could continue, like giving you fur, tail… dog ears! But I won’t… at least not now! Keeping you as a tiny human, who acts like a dog, will do for now!”<br />
<br />
Max is in shock, he can’t believe what is going on, the tiny boy just stands their in the pile of his clothes, “c-can’t this day get any worse,” he asks out loud.<br />
<br />
Carl walks up to the shrunken boy and kneels down, he reaches out a hands and starts to stroke Max’s head, “I promise I will take good care of you,” he says, grinning, “you’ll become the best dog ever. I’ll train you to become a really great guard dog”.<br />
<br />
Max tenses when he feels Carl stroking his head, but, the more the other boy strokes him, the more Max relax. The boy does not notice as he starts to sniff, taking in Carl’s scent, ‘he smells strong,’ Max thinks to himself, ‘my mind is telling me to obey him, that he is my master’.<br />
<br />
Carl grins when he notices Max sniff him, “do I smell good,” he asks, “I wonder what my scent is telling you”.<br />
<br />
Max blushes when he realizes what he is doing, “I…,” he says, “your scent… it tells me a lot”.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Carl asks, stopping his stroking, “tell me about it”.<br />
<br />
Max hesitates, ‘Carl is not like… hurting me,’ he thinks to himself, ‘he… he is actually being gentle’. The boy lets out a sigh, “it… it tells me your gender, but also your personality,” he starts.<br />
<br />
“Oh? What is my personality,” Carl asks, actually sounding curious.<br />
<br />
“I… I get the sense of you being dominant,” Max says, “you kinda smell like you have authority and that I must obey you. But it also tells me, that you are caring and gentle, that you are not really mean”.<br />
<br />
Carl is surprised, he then smiles, “you are absolutely right, Max,” he says, “yes, I enjoy bullying, but when it comes to animals, I am not evil or mean. I love animals above everything else, seeing you acting like a dog, causes me to have two sets of feelings”.<br />
<br />
Max tilts his head, “what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Carl chuckles, “fuck, you are to damn cute,” he says, he then laughs when Max blushes, “well, one part of me, the “bully-part”, is enjoying humiliating you. The other part, my “animal-loving-part”, just wants to be a good owner and take care of you”.<br />
<br />
Max is unsure what to say, “so… wh-what will happen now,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “you’ll be staying here until the end of school,” he says.<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Max shouts, “but… I can’t! I have to attend classes!”<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “not anymore,” he says, “you are so tiny, you wouldn’t be able to look over your desk. Other students, even your friends would tease you. No, you are now MY dog and dogs do not need school, except obedience school!”<br />
<br />
“But… but my family,” Max says.<br />
<br />
Carl smirks, “I AM your family,” he says, he grins, “and I know that your mind is telling you that that’s the case!”<br />
<br />
Max opens his mouth to protest, but finds he is unable to, he closes his mouth and just looks up at Carl, fearfully.<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “after school,” the boy continues, “I will come and pick you up, what happens after that… well… I’ll keep that a surprise,” he says.<br />
<br />
“B-but how are you going to be able to take me with you, without being noticed,” Max asks.<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “I brought a crate with me,” he says, “I’ll simply stuff you into it and walk out with you!”<br />
<br />
Max is in disbelief, “why does this have to happen?”<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “call it fate or curse,” he says, “I don’t care. All I care about is getting my DOG out of this boring place. Until then, I want you to stay and wait for my return”.<br />
<br />
Max feels the command take affect, his eyes widen when he realizes that he is unable to move.<br />
<br />
Carl grins down at Max, “good boy, Max,” he says, he then starts to free Max from his oversized clothes, “I’ll be taking these and throw them away, you won’t be needing clothes, animals don’t ware clothes, and you ARE an animal!”<br />
<br />
Max blushes and tries to cover himself, but due to the command, he is unable to.<br />
<br />
Carl chuckles, “so cute,” he says, he then stands up and unlocks the door, “I’ll see you later, Max. Be a good boy and stay,” with that, the 14 year-old leaves the closet, leaving the naked tiny 13 year-old in darkness.<br />
<br />
“Fuck my life,” Max mumbles to himself.</p>
