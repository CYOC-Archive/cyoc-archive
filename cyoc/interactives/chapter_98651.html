<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate was still in his werewolf form as he approached the backdoor to the Anderson home. He could easily see a light on inside, so he knew that someone was in the living room, but with the other lights out, he figured his dad and Eric were probably watching television. He carefully opened the door and stepped in to find the television off and his father and brother seated on the couch. His father was also fully transformed and had one arm over Eric&#39;s shoulders to hold the younger son to his father&#39;s side. The blackish brown fur on William&#39;s hands and forearms created the look like he was wearing gloves, but Nate&#39;s golden eyes could spot the short claws that tipped William&#39;s fingers and could also easily see that Eric was in no pain and hadn&#39;t been hurt. In fact both his younger brother and father looked relatively happy on something. What it was though, Nate didn&#39;t know. Nate also noted a gravy stain on the front of Eric&#39;s shirt and wondered where that came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Nate announced as he entered, hunkering down a bit to fit inside the room, as at his full height he was borderline too tall in his wolf form for most interior spaces. &quot;Have a good night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them looked up to see Nate&#39;s arrival and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, my night was rather quiet, but Eric had plenty of fun with Julie,&quot; William answered with pride in his younger son, &quot;enjoying young love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good,&quot; Nate let a smile come over his own muzzle as well, catching some low sniffs that William was giving with his sensitive wolf ears. He knew that his father was picking up Alex&#39;s scent on him and knowing that Nate had enjoyed his boyfriend&#39;s company again. Eric likely couldn&#39;t, but might be curious at what his father was sniffing at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric... why don&#39;t you get that shirt into the wash,&quot; William spoke, &quot;remember the instructions for the stain remover and let that shirt soak for the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Eric answered a he looked between he father and older brother  and got up.<br />
<br />
William watched as Eric got up and walked to the laundry room which was on the first floor underneath the upstairs bathroom and William and Martha&#39;s bedroom. Once he heard the door shut and Eric started dealing with the gravy stain on his shirt, he motioned for Nate to sit down beside him. Nate pulled down his lower lip on his muzzle and lowered his ears, as he didn&#39;t want to leave a mess by sitting down on the couch after the sexual acts he and Alex had just done. He also wondered if the furniture that had been built for humans could actually hold his weight in his were form. He knew he could easily change back, but being naked and human in front of his father seemed rather odd to him. Of course, some might argue that a naked werewolf talking to a fully dressed and transformed werefox would also be weird, but the didn&#39;t live in Moon Lake. Nate came over and knelled near the couch and set his backpack down in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you had a VERY good afternoon and evening,&quot; William began, &quot;Did you get your homework done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I do have some homework to finish,&quot; Nate admitted, &quot;but I did have a good time with Alex and meeting the Ramseys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate hoped the mention of Alex&#39;s last name would ease any issues his father had with whether or not his homework was done. Which was rather standard issues parents typically had, and seemed to make many of Nate&#39;s &quot;problems&quot; far more mundane than some of the things that had hit the Anderson family in the last few months. Starting with his father&#39;s infidelity leading to him impregnating a student in Minnesota, which lead to his firing and the entire family having to move. And while Nate knew that his parents did still love each other, he also knew that his father&#39;s infidelity had put an immense strain on their marriage that it probably wouldn&#39;t have taken that much to break it beyond repair. It had lead to Nate keeping quiet about his sexuality for fear that it would only serve to make matters worse. Then came Yvette&#39;s obsession with his father,  which marred his transformation into a werewolf slightly and nearly ruined things between his parents. Thankfully though, his father&#39;s bond to his mother as a werefox had likely saved their marriage, or at the very least made it easier, and that both his parents were perfectly fine with Nate&#39;s sexuality. It meant that in its own &quot;weird&quot; way, life was returning to normal for the Andersons.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... that&#39;s his last name?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dad, his name is Alex Ramsey,&quot; Nate nodded to his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that is good to know,&quot; William answered, &quot;and good that the two of you are getting on so well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, though from his father&#39;s look, he figured that his father had some private concerns of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how serious is it between you two?&quot; William asked, &quot;just casual at present, somewhat serious, or very serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate blinked and had to think for  a moment. He had gotten along well with Alex and the sex had been amazing between them, but Nate was quick to realize that sex was about the only thing that he and Alex really had to build on for the moment. It might lead to more, and Nate hoped it did, but he had to admit for the moment that it wasn&#39;t super serious, yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment... it&#39;s just casual... and probably Moon Lake casual, if you know what I mean,&quot; Nate answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; William answered with a sigh, as he remembered that he had Martha had agreed to take things slow with regards to healing their marriage when they had met each other again with both of them being weres, and they had ended up having passionate sex that night and Martha had commented &quot;slow&quot; for werebeasts was &quot;fast&quot; for normals. Were-beasts and their high libidos seemed to do that. Nate was probably enjoying the perks that went along with it. &quot;Just remember to be careful and to be respectful. Particularly if it becomes serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, dad,&quot; Nate answered.<br />
<br />
William leaned forward and placed on paw on Nate&#39;s knee.  He looked to his older son with a fair amount of concern to make sure that Nate didn&#39;t get carried away with things. He was glad that his antics didn&#39;t break Nate up from someone in Minnesota, and he would be strongly supportive of his son if someone dared to attack him for who he was, but William also remembered his own mistakes and issues that caused them. Having a high libido might make weres more willing to engage in sex when they wanted to, but William knew all to well the problems of letting one&#39;s libido govern one&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just looking to protect you, son,&quot; William said carefully, &quot;sex can be very pleasureful... and while you&#39;re in the casual phase of the relationship, there isn&#39;t anything wrong with being frequent or open about it... but always make sure that your relations include more than just that. If all your mother and I had going for us was how good sex was between us... we likely would have divorced the instant Martha learned I couldn&#39;t keep &quot;little Willie&quot; in my pants... and even as it was, you and Eric both saw the damage and stress it caused.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded. His father&#39;s affairs had caused trouble. Most of them hadn&#39;t done too much, as the consequences weren&#39;t serious, and William had engaged in them when he was horny and Martha wasn&#39;t, but his inability to make a lie believable and leaving his phone in a spot where Nate had been able to find it had made it pretty obvious to Nate and Martha the mistakes William had made. And much of that came even before the University of Minnesota coed had reported her pregnancy and filed rape charges against William. By that point, while William had been able to prove that the incident in question wasn&#39;t rape and was consensual on both parts, the damage had been done, and had been the &quot;come to Jesus moment&quot; William had really needed to fix the problems he had &quot;created.&quot; And while things were rapidly healing, William didn&#39;t want Nate to make the same mistakes he had made.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t want you to repeat my mistakes,&quot; William told told Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Nate told him, &quot;and do intend to get to know Alex more as we hang out. We have our first real date this coming Friday.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, William gave a smile and nodded, &quot;Alright then... go on and get cleaned up. Then get your homework done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded and was quick head for the stairs and the shower.</p>
