<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...turn himself into a baby.<br />
<br />
Some part of Jeff's mind was screaming, No! Don't! But, he didn't listen. He double checked his settings. First, he would become a 6-month-old infant. Second, his clothes would change with him, but his mind would remain the same. Third, Emily would believe that she was his mother as would everyone else but him. Finally, he made sure that the duration was set for 24 hours, with an automatic revert at the end. Before he could have another second thought, he turned the remote on himself and hit the activate button.<br />
<br />
This time, there seemed to be a ripple effect coming from the remote, as all of reality warped around the two of them. Emily's bra grew to encompass her swollen breasts and re-clasped itself. All the worry and confusion disappeared from her face as she took on the new role of Jeff’s mother.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Jeff could feel his body shrinking. The room seemed to grow larger around him as his height dwindled away. Then, he felt a sudden drop as he flew backwards through a growth spurt. He was out of his teens now and quickly dropping through his grade-school years. For a moment, he regretted not making the change slower so he could appreciate it more, but that passed as he became fascinated by his shrinking hands. With every second that ticked by, he watched as they grew ever younger and more baby-like. All the while, his jeans, his T-shirt and even his shoes were keeping pace with his shrinking body. Then, just after the top of the kitchen counter had risen above his eye line, Jeff felt his underwear start to swell up. He touched his pants to hear the tell-tale crinkle of a diaper underneath them. At that moment, the remote fell out of his tiny hand, which had become too small to hold it. He worried a moment that he might have broken it, but he was immediately distracted by his increasingly wobbly balance. His baby legs gave out beneath him, and he plopped to the floor on his padded behind. The changes stopped.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at himself. What he saw was unbelievable. He was a baby, a pudgy, soft, little baby. From his diaper to his tiny jeans and T-shirt to his stubby little shoes, he was completely dressed as a little baby. He looked up at the giant kitchen above him. Everything in it seemed designed to emphasize how small he was now. The chairs were far too large. The counters were impossibly out of his reach. Even the refrigerator door handle was tantalizingly far away.<br />
<br />
Finally, he saw her. Emily. Mommy. She was a giantess to him now. If he were his normal size, she would have stood over 12 feet tall. He knew his giant mommy could keep him safe from the big, scary world around him. He stared at the giant round globes on her chest, and felt his stomach rumble. Instinctively, he started to crawl to her.<br />
<br />
“Mahmuh,” he gurgled in his tiny baby voice as he approached her ankles.<br />
<br />
“Jeffy!” Emily said and smiled warmly at him. She bent over and snatched him up in her enormous hands and held him close to her. “How is my little man?” she cooed.<br />
<br />
Feeling safe and secure in her arms, Jeff just giggled and smiled as he leaned up against a breast bigger than his head. It was an awe-inspiring sight. He reached up a tiny hand and stroked its magnificent roundness. It felt so warm and soft, heavenly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, is my little guy ready for a feeding?” she asked.<br />
<br />
She set him down on the table, unclasped her bra, laid a towel on her shoulder, and opened her shirt, revealing a gigantic milk-swollen mammary. She picked him up again and led his mouth to her large dark nipple, and he was feeding. He sucked and tasted her warm sweet milk. To his baby mouth, it was the most delicious thing on earth. He drank and drank of her, only pausing for a moment as she shifted him to her other breast.<br />
<br />
He didn’t care that she was actually his sister, that she was really only a girl and he was really a teenager. None of that mattered. If anything, he was even more excited by how twisted the whole situation was. He just drank and drank losing himself in the absurdity of it all. Soon, his belly was overfull and pressing out uncomfortably. He stopped drinking.<br />
<br />
“All done?” she asked. She lifted him up to her shoulder and patted his back. He felt his guts turn as a large burp and a small gush of milk erupted from his mouth onto the towel. His face felt sticky and he felt mildly sickened by his own body, but, at the same time, he was grateful to have relived the pressure inside him.<br />
<br />
As she wiped up his face, she said, “Oooh, you were hungry? Weren’t you?”<br />
<br />
He smiled as he felt the warmth of her affection radiating through him. This is what he had been craving. He felt so safe and loved. It was pure bliss. Nothing could trouble him as she held him in her arms. It was heaven.<br />
<br />
Then, he became aware of a new warmth. Only this time, he felt it in his diaper. Jeff was shocked.<br />
<br />
Did I just mess myself without noticing? He wondered in disbelief. He really hoped he was mistaken.<br />
<br />
He shifted his butt around and felt the warm, damp squishiness against his skin. Then, he smelled it. It was revolting. If he hadn’t just thrown up, he might have lost his lunch right then.<br />
<br />
Maybe being a baby isn’t all that great after all, He thought.<br />
<br />
Emily sniffed the air. “Well, smells like someone needs a new dipey.” Jeff blushed to hear his sister say that about his poop.<br />
<br />
She started to carry him out of the kitchen to his bedroom but paused in the hallway.<br />
<br />
“What is this?” she asked. To his horror, he watched as she picked up the Chronivac remote from the floor where he had dropped it.<br />
<br />
No! He thought. If she starts using it, I might not be able to turn back into a teenager again. And, who knows what other kinds of trouble she could cause with it?<br />
<br />
He mentally kicked himself for not hiding it somewhere before he totally changed into a baby.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… ‘Chronivac’” she read. Jeff held his breath as he helplessly watched her turn it around in her hand. “Must belong to one of Dad’s TVs or something. It looks kinda funny, though.”<br />
<br />
After examining it a moment longer, she put it down on the kitchen counter and started to walk away.<br />
<br />
“Noooo,” wailed Jeff as he reached for it.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, honey,” she said to him as she carried him off to be changed. “We’ll deal with the remote after we get you a fresh diaper.”<br />
<br />
Crap, He thought. What am I going to do?</p>
