<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The crowd cheers as they wanted to witness more twists and turns between these two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Let us then give five additional years to Candy.&quot; Lesily shouted.<br />
<br />
Candy let out a wince as something weird was happening in her body. Going from 20-year-old to 25-year-old made her older than Mandy as she grew up. Her chest pushed even futher as the five years made her more mature and her lifestyle and fashion was embracing the goth side more. Her lipstick and make-up got heavier and her blonder hair was fully colored black. No hint of childish pastel colors couldn&#39;t be seen. From head to toes every clothing she had was either mix of leather straps, black satin or black frillies. Candy&#39;s ear pop out a thumbnail size black obsidian earrings and he skirt begun to lose more length reveling her black fishnet stockings what she was wearing. Her footwear swapped from black sandals into black combat boots and she highlighted her clothes with either white or gray color.<br />
<br />
Candy was sweating as something else was happening in her body. Something unexpected. Her belly was growing in size. She wasn&#39;t pregnant, but begun to gain more weight. She panted loudly as her belt buckle snapped and revealed that she was now officially chubby. Candy&#39;s lips sighed and moaned as she had hardtime concentrating. Maybe she had started drink, or have sex more often. Whatever it was it cause whole crowd to go wild. As the last of the changes had stopped she was now 25-years-old.<br />
<br />
Amanda started to shrank even more from her chest. The previously milfy body had now lost it&#39;s motherly curves as she dropped down from 25-year-old of age to 20-year-old. Her hair suddenly grew in size back to it&#39;s original and more. Her hair was almost in her waist and her clothing was more modest. The black color what she had was fading away and turned the crop top into a chamomille tea colored sweater. The black jeans were now dark blue and her whole body begun to compress. She looked like a colledge student who was there to study. Maybe in her life a stud had come into her life and introduced her more hedonistic lifestyle. Who knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy, are you feeling fine?&quot; Lesily asked from a visible sweating and panting Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm yeah, sorry, I just umm.. had training session with Amanda.&quot; Candy explained very briefly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how is your relationship with her?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like? Yeah, she&#39;s living with me but I&#39;m far to busy to talk with her. Like she just came to the college and I&#39;m still umm-&quot; Candy stopped in middle of sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you became shut-in and she is boarder.&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. She hands me the money and I go to the store and buy food. Why do you ask-&quot; Candy question but was put in slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Mandy... or Amanda how do you do?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Studying. Took some loan and met with a lady who had a big house all by herself. She lived so near the college so I asked her if she could provide me roof and umm here I am.&quot; Amanda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Asked? When and where?&quot; Lesily pried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. She was hanging at this bar near the college looking for men I assume? I have no idea what she was doing there but we clicked immediatly and you know. She&#39;s very clean, makes food and we have some light activity hear and there. Nothing more.&quot; Amanda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing more? Is she your type?&quot; Lesily asked once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavens no! She&#39;s a providor and I&#39;m giving her monetary payment. That is all.&quot; Amanda hastily responded as she was put in slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;The love needs right time at the right place. It seems that their personalities didn&#39;t match and this might happen. Sorry y&#39;all.&quot; Lesily apologized. &quot;But what if we push five more years to Candy. Will their relationship improve or what will happen?<br />
<br />
Candy&#39;s body begun to grow as five more years were added. The chubby weight what she had in her 25th birthday begun to pile up more and more as her body was getting overweight. Under her chin developed a fatty chin and her whole body pudged so rapidly that her whole goth clothes exploded as they couldn&#39;t contain her increasing body weight. Every part of the body puffed like a balloon until her previous chubby body was looking a lot of skinner than the overweight body she gained rapidly. The tits begun to push themselves downward and needed bra to keep them in place. Her belly button gained a depth of a index finger and the whole body was massive. As she hit her 30th birthday her only pieces of clothing were black crop top covering half of her belly and shorts which covered barely her asscheeks. She also wore sandals that looked very cheap.<br />
<br />
Amanda in other hand was just her height shrinking. Rest of her curves were slimmed, but the sweater, jeans and boots she wore was very similar than what she wore in college. The fashion sense looked similar than what she had as a 20-year-old, but now looking like a kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, surprising. Let&#39;s ask Amanda first how she feels?&quot; Lesily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Umm. Studying. Umm. Reading.&quot; Amanda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Candy? How do you feel about her?&quot; Lesily asked from Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy...? Oh you must mean Aunt Cadance. She&#39;s taking care of me. She&#39;s my babysitter.&quot; Amanda explained as she was put in slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see how Candy is doing. Hey, Candy what&#39;s cooking?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
Candy huffed as she tried to say something and let out a huge cough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... humm umm, sorry?&quot; Candy asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me your old friend, remember me?&quot; Lesily said.<br />
<br />
Candy went back into the slumber by herself without able to respond anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, that&#39;s interesting. Maybe Amanda&#39;s bad habits is influencing Candy in her future. Should we return some of Candy&#39;s age back at Amanda or should we go even further? What do you say?&quot; Lesily asked crowd once more.</p>
