<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark replied, &quot;I think we should start with the little sissy cry baby first.&quot;  A cruel smile crept across Madame&#39;s face, &quot;Ashley, baby, it&#39;s time to get you changed into some fresh clothes before you soil yourself.  You wouldn&#39;t want to make tinkles all over Madame&#39;s floor now would you?  No, hims wouldn&#39;t!&quot;  Against his will, Ashley stood on stage in front of Madame where the crowd could see him.  &quot;Oh my, those clothes are so unsuitable for a sweet baby like you.  We&#39;ll have to do something about that now won&#39;t we?  But don&#39;t worry, Madame&#39;s just got the perfect outfit for her sweet little baby boy-girl.  Using her magic, Madame suspended Ashley into the air right before magicking his clothes to float off him, one-by-one.  His shoes untied themselves and removed themselves off his feet to land on the stage below.  &quot;Eww, gross, why would a precious little flower like you wear such disgusting shoes as these?&quot;, asked Madame Illusia, &quot;We wouldn&#39;t want my adorable princess wearing such nasty shoes would we?  Here, let Maddame fix these shoes for you, diddums so that they&#39;re pretty.&quot;  Ashley watched from where he was suspended as his black running shoes slowly transformed into black glossy flat baby mary jane shoes that were slip resistant.  In his mind, he thought that maybe things wouldn&#39;t be as bad for him as they seem even though he was going to be treated as a baby for the rest of his life and never leave his nursery.  Next, he watched his white socks slide off his feet.  In front of his eyes, they gained a softer, more feminine look turning red as black ruffles appeared at the top.  His khaki cargo shorts slid off his waist.  They had slowly turned black in color.  He watched as the crotch and seat of his shorts expanded to make room for a thick diaper if need be as the shorts lost its zipper and buttons.  He also watched as the waistband of his shorts became stretchy and elasticized perfect for stretching over a baby, or rather his, bulky diaper.  The material thinned out turning from a rougher material to a lighter waterproof polyester as red taffeta ruffles spread out in lines across the back of his new baby pants.  The second to final transformation had the legs of the baby pants rose up making them look less like shorts and more like the baby panties that they were.  And last, a thin white absorbent terry lining formed on the inside of the baby pants in case a small amount of wetness escaped from the diaper and needed to be soaked up.  &quot;Oh no, how will you ever stay dry wearing those things!&quot;, Madame said talking about Ashley&#39;s underpants.  The boy already had bluish green trimmed white briefs and so she went with the same color scheme.  The briefs lost their fly as a cute babyish picture of a fox sleeping on a cloud took its place.  The front, back, and crotch thickened out so that it could absorb urine as a thin plastic layer formed between the first outside layer of cloth and the layers of cloth on the inside.  Inner leg gussets formed on the inside of the now training pants looking brief so that urine and perhaps messy accidents could be self contained.  The now cloth training pants turned from cloth to a papery like material found on disposable diapers and training pants that slightly crinkled as the sides formed easy to tear seams for easy removal while blue leaves, acorns, and paw prints formed around the sleeping fox that would fade away when wet.  The sides didn&#39;t stay together for very long, however as the seams tore themelves apart.  Where the seams were on the front and back panel of the ripped training pants, the material stretched and stretched forming wings.  On the back wings two very large greenish plastic velcro tabs formed and stretched themselves to the front panel locking Ashley into his oversized brand new disposable baby diaper.  His shirt blue polo shirt then turned to red velvet as the buttons on his front worked their way to the back making it harder for him to button or unbutton.  A black flouncy taffeta skirt formed around his waist to the point where he could no longer see his diaper, but others could clearly see that his skirt didn&#39;t cover his diaper from view.  First, the fancy baby pants worked their way up his legs, followed by his socks and his mary jane shoes. &quot;There, you look so precious now my little sugar plum, but we need to fix one more thing, don&#39;t we?&quot;, Madame Illusia said  Ashley&#39;s hair shifted itself until it was a very short baby girl&#39;s hair style with pig tails held together with red ribbon matching the color of his attire.  &quot;There you go, baby girl.  Now I think it&#39;s time to move you to your new home.  I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll find it furnished much to your delight!&quot;  It has everything there needed to take care of a six month old baby such as yourself.  You&#39;ll get a beautiful white crib, tasty baby food for you to eat and tasty infant formula to drink from a baby bottle in your high chair, beautiful clothes, a lifetime supply of diapers, and a wide variety of infant toys for you to play with.  But, you won&#39;t find a television or video games in there because that&#39;s bad for babies.  you won&#39;t even find a window to the outside world for you to look at.  There will be no books with words in it, just baby board books with pictures. And no numbers or letters in your nursery for you to see aside from the two printed on your diaper.  It&#39;s time for you to meet your brand new nanny who will take care of you.  Isn&#39;t that exciting?  She&#39;s in your nursery waiting for you right now.  Bye-bye baby girl.  Bye-by!&quot;, Madame Illusia said while waiving to the ten year old boy in an oversized infant dress.  And just like that, Ashley disappeared into his new nursery.  Margot and Mary Anne were terrified now.  If this woman could do that to Ashley, then she intended to do worse to everyone else but Mark.  In fact, Margot knew that the crazy old witch intended to kill her youngest daughter by unbirthing her.  However, being stuck frozen, there was nothing she could do.  Mark was busting out laughing.  The little sissy finally got what was coming to him.  He couldn&#39;t wait to have a robot maid to cook and clean for him and a mindless sexy slut who&#39;s personality he could change by touching her nose to wrap her lips around his cock.  He was having second thoughts about Morgan, though.  Maybe she could be dealt with in some other way.  The brat irritated him, but he had an idea.  &quot;Madame, I don&#39;t want Morgan to disappear.  Is there a way she could be permanently transferred into Mary Anne&#39;s womb when she becomes a robot?  I think it would be fun to be able see Morgan floating around in her new robotic womb, so please make sure to have a window installed into Mary Anne&#39;s womb so that I can look inside.  Both Mary Anne and Margot agreed with Mark.  Morgan&#39;s life would be a miserable existence, but at least she&#39;d be alive and able to live out her life.  Madame Illusia had agreed.  It was far better to torture Morgan than it was to kill her.</p>
