<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a moment, you were too flabbergasted to even react.  Just as you made up your mind to quit then and there, you realized that two persons have entered the store.  You are in such a state that it takes a few second before you recognize the uniform, and then the individuals wearing that uniform.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s Gina and Traci, two girls from your high school who are in the &quot;in&quot; crowd, and you are definitely out.  You freeze, a blank look on your face, terrified of what will happen when they find out what happened to you.  However, instead of laughing and pointing in derision, the two girls titter and look you over appreciatively as they approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you the guy who runs this joint?&quot; Gina asks ingratiatingly, making eyes at you.<br />
<br />
At that point you become aware that neither of them recognize you, and of course, who would with the way you look now?  Even stranger, it looks like they are coming on to you.  You can&#39;t think of what to do next, so you just stand there, ramrod straight, without responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to my little Game Corner, how may I be of service to you?&quot;  the Game Master approached from the other side of the store, where he had gone unnoticed by the two teenagers.  At the sight of the strange man in robes that looked like they were straight out of a storybook, the girls&#39; expressions fell slightly.  &quot;Don&#39;t mind him, he&#39;s just my new help,&quot; the Game Master continued, waving a hand at you.  The girls give you a hopeful look, but then turn back to the Game Master.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can change the way people look, right?&quot;  Traci asked the Game Master.  &quot;I want to look so beautiful my cheating boyfriend will regret ever looking at those tramps in our school,&quot;  Tracy pouted, as Gina nodded sympathetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to look prettier too, I really want Carl Mason to ask me out,&quot;  Gina smiled slyly.  &quot;He just needs the right encouragement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot;  the Game Master responded inscrutably.  &quot;But there is always a price to pay for these things.  If you want my help, you&#39;ll have to play a little game, take a little risk.  Is that acceptable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of risk?&quot;  Gina asked, unsure.  However, Traci cut her off.  &quot;C&#39;mon, we said we were gonna do this, don&#39;t wimp out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite simple,&quot; the Game Master smiled deviously.  &quot;The potion I have for beauty is rather unique.  It will make one aspect of you more beautiful.  However, in exchange, another aspect of you will change and become less attractive, at least according to common sensibilities.  There is no way to determine what will change for better or for worse, or how much they may change, and any changes are irreversible for at least a week.  Now that you know the rules, do you still want to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, that&#39;s what we came here for,&quot;  Traci retorted assertively, while Gina uncomfortably nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go pour some of the Beauty Serum in the back into this,&quot;  the Game Master turns to you, holding out a small glass vial.  &quot;You&#39;ll find it on the third row from the end, one of the &#39;B&#39; shelves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master,&quot;  you respond, bowing your head slightly, and trot into the back.  However, your mind is awhirl, and you are vexed at your subservient response.  Still, you figure it is better to obey and get the girls out of the store, rather than to cause a ruckus and be found out by them.  Of all the people in your class, they were two you couldn&#39;t stand.  Obsessed with fashion and boys, they sneered at students like you who took school seriously and had no time for hair salons and make-up.  They treated you like dirt, and because of their looks and manipulative nature, were able to get away with it.  You hoped life would teach them a lesson, but society itself seemed to be skewed in favor of people like that.  <br />
<br />
Irked at having to help the girls make themselves prettier, you finally find the large glass canister marked &quot;Beauty Serum:  Tit for Tat&quot;  and pour some of the fuchsia-colored liquid into the vial.  As you return the canister to the shelf, you catch sight of a bright blue liquid in a container on the opposite shelf, a part of the &quot;A&quot; section.  It is labeled &quot;Animal Transformation.&quot;  A wicked idea creeps into your mind, and try as you might to shake it, you know you want to do it, no matter the risk.  Before you can second-guess yourself, you pull down the &quot;Animal Transformation&quot; container and pour a single drop into the vial filled with Beauty Serum.  Aside from a slight &quot;poof,&quot; you can see no visible change to the liquid.  You quickly return the container and trot back into the shop with the vial, gracefully handing it to the Game Master, who gives no indication of knowing what you have done.<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, the Game Master changed the wall behind the girls into a large mirror.  Pouring the vial into two small glasses, the Game Master set the concoction before the girls, raising a hand and saying, &quot;One more rule, you both must drink at the same time if you want to play.&quot;  Gina looked even more intimidated, but Traci glared at her until she picked up her glass as well.  Throwing caution to the wind, both girls gulped down the contents of the glasses.  For a few moments, nothing appeared to change.  However, almost imperceptibly, the girls began to look slightly different than before.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re getting taller,&quot; Gina said to Traci, squinting concentratedly.  Sure enough, Traci&#39;s legs were becoming longer and lankier, adding to her height and giving her appearance a thinner and more lithe look.  Gina, on the other hand, did not change size, but her hair began to take on a brighter sheen and a slight wave, framing her face and setting off her cheekbones, and falling in luxurious tresses down past her shoulders.  As the girls turned to admire themselves in the mirror, you wonder whether you should be annoyed or relieved your little stunt didn&#39;t seem to work.  You also don&#39;t see anything about the girls that seems to be uglier, either.  However, the Game Master just looked on in amusement, as though he were waiting for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is great!&quot;  Traci grinned triumphantly.  &quot;I can&#39;t wait to make Jason jealous.&quot;  Gina smiled back, but then her expression changed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your ears!&quot;  Gina cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot;  Traci frowned, turning back to the mirror.  As Traci had been admiring her legs, her ears had slowly become pointed, then longer.  Now, as she finally looked at them, they twitched back and forth from a position closer to the top of her head.  &quot;What the he..eee-haw?!&quot;  Tracy started, but ended in a horrified bray.  Her front teeth were also slightly longer, and her face had a rather equine aspect.  She turned to Gina, panicking, but her eyes opened wide as she stared at her friend.  While Traci was taller thanks to the serum, Gina seemed slightly shorter than before, and her posture looked odd.  Glancing down, Traci pointed terrified at Gina&#39;s legs.  Slightly bowed, their position made Gina appear shorter, but what truly shocked the girls was the sudden appearance of a large amount of hair covering Gina&#39;s legs.  Before they had time to digest what was happening, Gina grunted in pain, and sat down hard.  Pulling off her shoes and socks, she stared at feet which now appeared more like hands.  You realize that your additive must have worked, and now Traci had a decidedly donkey-ish head and Gina had chimpanzee-like legs.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?!&quot; Tracy yelled.  &quot;You gotta change us ba...hee-haww...ack!&quot;  Gina just sobbed silently.  The Game Master, however, simply said, &quot;You agreed to the risks, and you did get the increased beauty you asked for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this to us!&quot;  Tracy was beside herself.  &quot;I&#39;ll make sure everyone knows what a qua...hee-haww...ack you really are!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Game Master snorted derisively, &quot;You knew it was irreversible for a week when you asked for this.  Of course, I could always just leave you like that permanently...&quot;<br />
<br />
Traci looked like she would go after the Game Master right then and there, but Gina tugged her back and said tearfully, &quot;Let&#39;s just go, I don&#39;t want to be stuck like this forever.&quot;  Although furious, Traci finally acquiesced and trotted out of the store on her long legs, with Gina waddling behind, hair bouncing voluminously, trying to keep up on her new feet.  Now that the initial shock is over, you can barely keep from laughing.  However, your self-congratulatory smile comes to an abrupt halt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t know about your little escapade with my potions,&quot;  the Game Master stated, turning to you.  &quot;I could make you pay me back...but I think I know something that would be a bit more effective and entertaining.&quot;  The Game Master waved his hand, at which point you realize...</p>
