<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a fun but long afternoon at the large shopping mall for Ty. He had secretly changed about a dozen guys just by staring at his victims from a safe distance and by making his wishes in silence. He had made several people grow taller, wider and more muscular without any of them knowing or understanding what was happening to them. They had all gained muscle in a matter of seconds, becoming more buff and athletic. Ty had helped nerdy guys, young kids, teens and college guys. He even changed a few chubby guys into young athletes! <br />
<br />
All the transformation fun had caused Ty to work up a tremendous thirst. Luckily, he had just strolled past the entrance to the large food court where all the food places were located. So, Ty wandered around until he spotted the ice cream place. He just had a craving for something cold since it was the middle of summer and he just wanted something cool. <br />
<br />
He stood in line for a few minutes until his turn came up. He ordered a cup of ice cream and rummaged in his shorts pocket when he needed to pay. To his horror, he pulled out just $3 from his pockets when he realized that he didn’t have enough money to pay for his ice cream. <br />
<br />
“Oh crap… I’m a Dollar short…” Ty said quietly although it was just loud enough for others in line to hear it. Just when it dawned on him that he could just wish for more money, the man standing behind him spoke up. <br />
<br />
“I got ya covered, kid…” the man said. “Gimme three scoops of vanilla… And, I’m paying for the kid’s ice cream!” he instructed the lady behind the counter as he handed her a $10 Bill. <br />
<br />
“Gosh, dude… Thanks! You didn’t have to do that! I mean…” Ty said, feeling a little ashamed that he was short on cash. <br />
<br />
Ty and the young guy walked over to one of the tables where they sat down at the chairs. Ty noticed how the tall guy was all dressed in black leather with boots, a black leather vest and even long black leather pants. <br />
<br />
“Don’t mention it, kid… By the way, I’m Louie…” the man said as he quickly ate his ice cream. <br />
<br />
“Oh! Nice! I’m Ty! Thanks for paying for my ice cream!” Ty said, as he looked at all the leather that Louie was wearing. “You sure like to wear a lot of leather!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah… Leather keeps me warm! Plus, I like to wear it when I walk around the neighborhood! It makes me look kinda bigger than I really am, you know?” Louie explained. <br />
<br />
“Aww… You wear leather just to make you look buff?” Ty chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m tall and lean, but not very muscular…. So I cover myself in leather… Leather is nice and thick, you know what I mean? It offers more protection than cotton t-shirts or jeans!” Louie explained. <br />
<br />
“Aww… I guess you would be even MORE impressive if you actually had some HUGE muscles in addition to all that leather, right?” Ty chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Yeah but I don’t have the time for that!” Louie grumbled as he finished his ice cream. He threw his cup in the trash and he then waited for Ty to finish and stand up. <br />
<br />
“Here, I need to leave soon. Here is a card with my number.” Louie said, giving Ty his cell phone number. The two then walked down the wide hallway with Ty walking behind Louie. <br />
<br />
When they were walking towards the exit, Ty quietly wished for Louie’s muscles to increase and for his leather clothes to adjust to his growth so he wouldn’t burst out of his nice leather clothing at all. <br />
<br />
The tall, hairy, young man, who was about 6-foot-1 inches tall and weighed about 200 pounds, was walking at a steady pace towards the mall exit when he slowed down and finally just stopped in the middle of his stride. His muscles all tensed up as he craned his neck all the way back, showing his black goatee. <br />
<br />
Louie let out a loud moan as he tensed every muscle under his leather. Then, his leather pants started to widen in every direction, thanks to his growing muscles. Ty was admiring the growth spurt from behind and knew what was going on. Louie’s leather vest and shirt were stretching outwards and sideways as his pecs started to expand outwards and sideways as well, all at once. His entire torso was becoming wider, as Ty saw that growth by the growth of all the leather clothes that Louie was wearing. <br />
<br />
After about thirty seconds had passed, the growth spurt had ended and Louie was MUCH bigger and wider than he was before. His leather clothing had expanded dramatically, thanks to his muscles having growth so much. Ty could only imagine how massive Louie had become!<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Ty said as he walked up to Louie, who seemed a bit dazed following the growth spurt. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Yeah… I’m just feeling kinda… Heavy…” Louie groaned, flexing his arm and making his leather sleeve bulge to the max. It almost looked like his muscle was going to rip his leather sleeve apart. <br />
<br />
“Well, you’re all big, now! Now you’re REALLY big! Not just because you’re wearing leather!” Ty smiled. <br />
<br />
“Yeah…. You’re right, kid! I’m totally… huge!” Louie sighed, realizing he wanted to get home so he could check himself out. “Well, I gotta go, kid…. See ya later!” <br />
<br />
Louie then walked out the door and got on his motorcycle and rode home so he could check out his muscles. But, Louie hadn’t gotten rid of Ty that easily. Ty quietly wished to be at Louie’s house and to become invisible so he could see what Louie looked like without all that leather covering his muscles…</p>
