<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After wandering for a while, Jeff had thought about his options. He thought about places such as the gym, or a store frequented by women, but he had something else in mind. Jeff had always wondered what it would be like to be young again, but what about being a young girl? Jeff had lived 16 years as a boy, but had always wondered what it would’ve been like to grow up on the “other side,” so to speak.<br />
Jeff mentally made his decision, heading toward the mall’s playground. He had decided he wanted to be young, but not too young to the point of a toddler or baby. He knew the best place to find younger kids to be the average of, was at the mall playground.<br />
It took him a moment to walk around the mall. It wasn’t terribly big, but the giant circle still took a good few minutes. He knew that soon enough, it would be an even longer walk than it was now.<br />
Jeff’s anticipation had his penis tenting in his shorts. He waited a minute to calm himself down before continuing on, as it’s not a sight that everyone needed to see. However, he knew that he wouldn’t have to ever deal with that problem again.<br />
Jeff’s trek led him to the mall playground. He observed some of the children for a minute. He noted that there were quite a few girls running around. He made the last few changes on the device’s settings in his hand, to scan for only females. <br />
Jeff then entered into the vicinity of the playground. The smell of the large plastic playtoys giving him a bit of nostalgia of when he was young. He looked around at the parents. One or two looked up at him, and then busied themselves back into their phones or activities. He figured that they thought he was looking for a sibling to pick them up. <br />
A few of the kids looked at him, but they were all so preoccupied with playing, that they didn’t pay Jeff any mind. Jeff knew that this was his moment.<br />
Jeff took the device in his hand and rolled it around. The cold metal felt odd to his fingertips. Could it really do what it advertised? He knew that all he could do was press the button, and wait to see. With that, he pressed the button. Jeff felt as a small tingling flooded inti his hand, then spread through his body. <br />
Jeff waited for a moment, seeing if anything was happening at all to him. He couldn’t see anything, which disappointed him. Unbeknownst to Jeff, however, was that his hair had started to grow a bit. Going from a few inches, down to his shoulders. <br />
Jeff decided that if he was actually changing, he wanted to do it somewhere where he couldn’t be seen as well. Luckily for him, there was a little cubby hole blocked off from the vision of most everyone there. Unluckily, however, was the fact that he had to squeeze his currently male 16 year old body into such a small space. Now Jeff was around 5’10”, and was fairly lean. However, this action was still quite the ordeal.<br />
As Jeff squeezed into the cubby hole, his hands had started to change. They went from being large male hands, covered in hair, to the hands of a young girl. The hair on his hands receded, as well as most of the hair on his arms, leaving smoother skin than rough hairy skin. <br />
Jeff finally finished squeezing his body into the cubby hole, cramping his legs up almost next to his face. A face that had, unknowingly to Jeff, changed from a 16 year old male face, to that of a 7 year old girl. His eyes had gone from a dark brown to a vibrant blue. His nose became much smaller and daintier. His mouth had even shifted, replacing his adult teeth with nice clean rows of baby teeth. <br />
As Jeff sat there, he felt a scratching at his throat. This change was when his Adam’s Apple would disappear, and his vocal chords would tighten to be much higher pitched. His voice would now be indistinguishable to that of a young girl.<br />
“Man, is this even working?” Jeff asked himself, almost not registering how his voice had changed. That was when he realized the other changes that had already happened. He could feel his hair brushing against his shoulders. He looked at his child-sized arms and hands, that were much too small for his body. He reached a cramped hand as best he could to his face, feeling his new feminine face.<br />
This was when Jeff’s next change started, as his body started to rapidly shrink. It lost all hair that it originally had, and shrank down from a 5’10” body, to around 3’6”. Jeff felt as he no longer had to hold his cramped pose, and sighed a sigh of relief. He could enjoy the rest of the changes while not being in pain. He did however, reach a hand to feel his new chest, as it had now been replaced with a smooth young female body. <br />
Jeff’s feet then changed from being large make feet. To a much smaller size, fitting of the 3 and a half feet tall he now was. His legs lost all hair as well, leaving smooth legs for him to rub his hands over.<br />
The next change was the one Jeff had been anticipating, as he would shed himself of his male role, and take up the mantle of the female role. <br />
Jeff’s member stood erect, his shorts straining to hold it in. Jeff smiled, as he was rather horny at what was happening. He resisted the urge to actually do anything though, as he knew it would be a mess to clean up if he did do anything here. <br />
Jeff did, however, get to watch as his member, erect and throbbing, slowly shrunk back inward. The strain in his shorts grew less and less. After about a minute. Jeff felt a hand to feel as the tip of his member shrank back into his body, leaving only his scrotum and testes. <br />
Jeff’s testes were next, as he felt then slowly pop up into his body. It was rather painful, as these members were not meant to do as such, but they would eventually play a new purpose. Jeff felt as they reshaped themselves into ovaries, and filled with eggs. <br />
Jeff then felt as his new vaginal opening formed, leaving him with only a vertical slit down there, and nothing else. He could now feel the new sensations, and could already tell that even at the seven years old he now was, that a female body was much more sensitive than a male body ever could be.<br />
Jeff smiled as he knew his physical changes had ended, leaving him as a young girl for the rest of his life. Burdened to carry children, and deal with the joys of womanhood. Jeff realized that referring to himself as a he was no longer necessary, and that she would be a more fitting term. <br />
Jeff then felt as her clothes started to shift around her body, becoming clothes fitting for the 7 year old girl she now was. She felt as her boxers shifted to a pair of girl’s panties, that would tightly hug against her body. She looked to see as her shorts shifted into a pair of girl’s short shorts. Leaving most of her legs, and stomach uncovered. <br />
Jeff would then see as her shirt would shift i ti a t-shirt, that had princess crowns and glitter on it. Her shoes would then shift to become a pair of girl’s sneakers. <br />
With that, Jeff was now fully a young girl. She had walked into the playground as a boy, and would walk out as a girl, with nobody being any the wiser.<br />
Jeff prepared to crawl out of the cubby hole, and as she got into position, she instinctively slammed her legs together. She winced in anticipatory pain, but it never came. That’s when she remembered that she wouldn’t have to worry about crushing her reproductive system ever again, and that her pain would be different once she hit puberty.<br />
Jeff crawled out of the cubby hole, and once she was out, she stood up. A young 7 year old ready to face the world. As she looked around, she gained a bit of knowledge about what her new life was like. Mainly that her parents were now shopping at the mall, and that she would be going back to school here in a few days once summer ended. <br />
As Jeff stood there, she knew one thing for certain, and that was that she really needed to pee. She looked around to see a bathroom conveniently next to the playground. She did her best to hold in the pee, still not used to how her new system held it in. She had always been used to her member being able to store some of the pee, but now she had less time to make it to the restroom.<br />
Jeff got to the restrooms, and almost instinctively went into the men’s room, when she realized that it wasn’t the right room for her now female body. Jeff then rushed into the women’s room. <br />
Jeff could see a long row of stalls in the room, and it seemed a bit cleaner than a normal men’s room. Jeff then found a stall, and quickly went in, locking the door. She undid her shorts, and was able to sit down on the toilet, with minimal amounts of pee escaping before she could do so.<br />
Jeff watched as her urethra ejected the golden liquid into the toilet. It was the first time Jeff had ever seen a woman pee, or seen a woman naked at that. She was just glad that her first time was actually on herself, and not somebody else. She finished peeing, and reached down to shake things off, but realized that she could now longer do that. Jeff then got some toilet paper, and dabbed away the rest that was left over on her rather sensitive vagina. <br />
Jeff was intrigued at how she would have to handle the restroom for the rest of her life. She could no longer direct the pee where she wanted to. She also would have to clean up after herself every time. She thought to a few scenarios that she would have to anticipate, such as going in the woods during a hike.<br />
Jeff finished up, flushed the toilet, and pulled up her shorts. They fit snugly against her new flat vagina. She exited the stall, and then went to wash her hands. Being much shorter now, she had some trouble reaching the sinks, but was able to lift herself up enough to wash her hands properly. <br />
Jeff then exited the restroom, and went back to the mall play area. She knew that it wasn’t wise to go anywhere by herself at the moment, as she couldn’t defend herself if anything did happen. <br />
Jeff ended up waiting for her parents, she knew they would take a bit of time. While she waited, she went and played with some of the other kids at the playground. After about half an hour, Jeff’s parents cake to get her from the playground.<br />
Jeff went with her parents. She was wondering what was going to happen next.</p>
