<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had taken Mark a little time to figure out what had happened to him. As he had killed the shower worriedly and stepped out of the tub, he found he was smaller. That didn’t make any sense, and he was in shock as he toweled himself off. He had sat on the lid of toilet in confusion for a few minutes, holding his now gigantically long and heavy limp penis in both hands. It was so big it didn’t recede into his sheath anymore, and he could fold it over his shoulder. His testicles were oversized and when he walked they bounced and flopped against his thighs, dangling nearly to his knees. Eventually he had put two and two together, and came to the conclusion that his last orgasm had shrunken his body down, but his cock and balls had stayed the same size. Mark was conflicted about whether this was a bad thing or not, but he decided he’d better get this fixed.<br />
<br />
In response, and to his amazement, his body instantly restored itself to its original height, putting everything back in proportion. Mark gasped and got to his feet. How did Ty fix him? Mark shook his head and looked around the bathroom. He wished he knew what the heck was going on. In another instant, a stream of information suddenly entered his mind. Ty had wished for and gotten the power to change anything he wanted, and in changing Mark, Ty had passed on his ability on with a simple thought. Ty had given Mark his power too! Mark gulped, and thought about growing taller until he said &quot;stop&quot; out loud. He stood at the bathroom mirror and leaned over the counter excitedly watching himself, and sure enough his height began to steadily increase. From his even six feet, he allowed himself to grow an extra foot taller to seven feet before he practically whispered &quot;stop&quot; in amazement. He realized with a sly grin that he had been thinking about how big his cock was when he had been sucking it, and that must have changed him. He’d have to be careful about what he thought of from now on.<br />
<br />
Now what was going on downstairs? Mark wondered. As he left the bathroom he heard June in the master bedroom, humming a sweet song. He peeked through the halfway closed door and saw his wife putting on her sexy red stockings and scanty dress. He gasped in pleased surprise. He hadn’t seen her wear that outfit in years. He felt his genitals stirring again, and quickly looked away and willed himself to calm down and focus. He did, and his arousal subsided. He’d have to get back to June fast! Curiously, he peered downstairs just in time to see Ty giving a hand job to a huge muscle-bound Minotaur and the living room carpet and wall dripping with semen. He went wide-eyed and averted his gaze in embarrassment, fresh memories on his being shrunken and under Ty’s control in his mind. Apparently his stepson was really getting off on his power, and Mark watched in shocked curiosity at the big manly beast his son had become.<br />
<br />
Was he being turned on by his own son?! He was such a handsome minotaur, so big and strong, with a huge throbbing cock. Mark jumped as he felt his cock slap against his crotch and begin to grow out to erection. Confused, but at the same time enticed, Mark took gentle hoof steps down the stairs to watch. Ty gave Dustin a final primal jerk and the big minotaur let out a MOO of satisfaction as he let go of a load that would put even Mark&#39;s mighty cum cannon to shame. Giant, panting, and now sitting on hands and knees, tongue dangling out, Mark couldn&#39;t believe how sexy that whole display had been. He was now sprouting his full cock, and absently his hand jerked his long meaty shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; Mark gulped, catching the grinning boy&#39;s attention. Ty blushed deep red, but saw Mark&#39;s hardened cock and licked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dad?&quot; Dustin said in a deep gravelly voice. &quot;Ohhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were... that you liked... this.&quot; Mark said with a lighthearted smile.</p>
