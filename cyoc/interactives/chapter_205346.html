<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy looked to Rusty, who had pulled himself onto the couch, and made her decision.<br />
<br />
She popped the door open a crack and tossed her Book onto the door mat, then closed it. There was a twinge of pain from her abdomen, the stress on her baby sending shooting pain up her back. She settled back into the couch and waited.<br />
<br />
A minute ticked by. Then another. She had another minute before her water broke.<br />
<br />
There was a bump at the door, and then it slowly swung open.<br />
<br />
RK Palatine stepped inside, hand firmly grasping his Book.<br />
<br />
“I’m very sorry, Troy, but I had to do what I had to do.”<br />
<br />
“RK!” Rusty growled. “I’m a freak because of you!”<br />
<br />
“You’ve never known anything else.” RK pointed out.<br />
<br />
“What, you think I want to be like this, that I didn’t wish every day to be normal?” Rusty snarled. “You just subjected me to literal torture!”<br />
<br />
“And I apologize. I will fix it.” RK soothed. “Believe me, I didn’t want it to come to this.”<br />
<br />
A jolt of pain made Troy cry out.<br />
<br />
“Gender.” RK pointed at Troy.<br />
<br />
The taste of copper flooded her mouth and a shiver raced up her spine. Abruptly, the pain and discomfort went away. Troy watch in awe as her belly shrank, breasts receding into her chest, leaving only her pecs behind. Her clit swelled and extended, ovaries popping out of her slit. A few moments later, and ‘she’ was now a ‘he’ again.<br />
<br />
“The baby?” Rusty whined, his head resting on Troy’s lap. “What happened to our baby?”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay Rusty, it’s only gone for a moment.” RK soothed and then looked at Troy. “Plug your husband’s ears, please.”<br />
<br />
Troy stared down at Rusty, who was whining and rubbing his head against Troy’s abs. He carefully plugged his ears. Then he glanced up at RK, who was watching them with a queasy expression, and nodded.<br />
<br />
“I’m ready.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“I promise you’ll be happy.” RK pointed at Rusty and muttered something under his breath, then pointed him. “Cover your ears.”<br />
<br />
Troy did and shivered, tasting copper again. When he opened his eyes again, RK was leaving. He was going to ask him what he’d done, but the door closed.<br />
<br />
“Troy?” Rusty spoke from Troy’s lap.<br />
<br />
Troy looked down and tears of joy sprang into his eyes. Rusty was staring up at him with his regular beautiful baby blues. Rusty sat up and wiped away Troy’s tears with his paw.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, babe?” Rusty asked. “Was there someone outside?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Troy blinked. “Oh, yeah, don’t worry, RK was just stopping by to take the Book.”<br />
<br />
Rusty sighed. “So he made good on his deal, huh? Am I normal again, or whatever?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have assholes for eyes and you aren’t a quadriplegic.” Troy said. <br />
<br />
“Good God!” Rusty barked. “That’s…wow. Fucking cruel.”<br />
<br />
“I was pregnant and a woman.”<br />
<br />
“A woman, huh?” Rusty smirked. “Didja have big ole’ bazongers?”<br />
<br />
Troy rolled his yes. “Yeah. He said I’d be a woman again, give us our wedding night.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Rusty examined Troy. “You definitely have a dick, not a pussy, so he clearly messed up.”<br />
<br />
Troy looked down and blushed. His cock was erect and very obvious under his dress.<br />
<br />
“Nice dress. Guess I have to believe you.” Rusty smirked.<br />
<br />
“Shut up!” Troy slapped his boyfriend on the shoulder. “It isn’t funny, Rusty! It was horrifying.”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Rusty leaned forward, running his paw along Troy’s wet muzzle. “I know. You’re shaking.”<br />
<br />
Rusty leaned forward and Troy kissed him.<br />
<br />
Tory and Rusty took their time, deepening the kiss. Tory’s cock strained against the confines of the dress he was wearing still. Rusty glanced down at it and chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Seems to know what he wants.” Rusty reached out and rubbed Troy’s aching cock through the dress.<br />
<br />
“Rusty…” Troy moaned, bucking his hips, a wet spot forming on the dress.<br />
<br />
“Come on, baby,” Rusty kissed Troy again, running his paw up and down Troy’s back., “Let’s go to bed.”<br />
<br />
Rusty hefted Troy up in both arms and carried him to the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Troy caught their reflection in the hall mirror as they passed and frowned. Rusty muscular German Shepherd form was correct, but something himself was off. Was he always a German Shepherd too? For some reason, he thought he’d been a tiger.<br />
<br />
Then the mirror was gone and they were in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Rusty, I think he turned me into a German Shepherd.”<br />
<br />
“What were you before?” Rusty paused.<br />
<br />
“A tiger, I think.”<br />
<br />
“Oh geeze!” Rusty cringed. “I’d never date a cat.”<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“No blowjobs.” Rusty shrugged. &quot;Cats have those awful barbed tongues!”<br />
<br />
Rusty shucked his pants and the room filled with the smell of horny dog. His big red bone throbbed and glistened with pre. Troy sighed and laid back against the pillows, tried to relax.<br />
<br />
“You know, if your cock wasn’t so hard, I’d say you were super stressed out.” Rusty smirked and climbed into bed and snuggled next to Troy.<br />
<br />
“I just…” Troy sighed. “I’m scared. What if I turn into a woman like he said?”<br />
<br />
Rusty cocked his head. “Well, I’d love you.”<br />
<br />
Troy blinked. “What?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll always love you, Troy.” Rusty leaned over and began to lick Troy’s neck tenderly.<br />
<br />
Troy moaned. “I love you too, Rusty.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s get that dress off you.” Rusty pulled the dress off Troy.<br />
<br />
Troy held his breath and looked down. Just a normal, twunky bottom’s athletic body greeted him. Along with his hefty boner. He gave a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
“Perfectly normal man.” Rusty said, tossing the dress away. “Better?” <br />
 <br />
Troy nodded. “Much.”<br />
<br />
Rusty bent down and began making out with Troy.<br />
<br />
Troy relaxed, enjoying the tongue-on-tongue action. Rusty lowered his hips and gently slid his cock between Troy’s legs. It rubbed against a spot just beneath Troy’s balls, smearing his creamy fur with precum.<br />
<br />
“Missed.” Troy smirked.<br />
<br />
“Mmm.” Rusty groaned in Troy’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Rusty lowered his head and nibbled on Troy’s nipple.<br />
<br />
Troy gasped, feeling a little electric jolt of pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Like that?” Rusty looked up at Troy and smirked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Wow.”<br />
<br />
Rusty bent down and began teasing his nipple again. The little nub plumped up under his delicate bites and the areola widened. Troy huffed and wagged his tail happily.<br />
<br />
The Shepherd bucked his hips again, grinding his cock against Troy’s taint. The flesh gave slightly, the impact shaking Troy’s insides.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Watch it babe.” Troy gasped, feeling a little nauseous.<br />
<br />
“Hurt?” Rusty asked.<br />
<br />
“A little.” <br />
<br />
“I’ll be gentle.” Rusty said, licking Troy’s tender nipples. <br />
<br />
They wobbled and lifted away from his chest, swelling with fat and glands. Troy moaned, voice pitching higher. His nipples were so sensitive, the warm moist tongue lapping at them, contrasting with the cool air, was so lovely it made his toes curl.<br />
<br />
Troy pet Rusty’s soft warm head, pressing his muzzle to his breasts. Happy little jolts of pleasure struck him every time Rusty gave them a nibble. He felt so good, floating happily on a cloud of pleasure. He didn’t notice the gold ring on his finger.<br />
<br />
Rusty thrust again, his turgid cock striking the same tender patch of taint.<br />
<br />
Troy felt a mixture of discomfort and arousal, the impact jostling his swelling breasts. <br />
<br />
He moaned, feeling strangely warm and cold all at once. His hand gently stroked Rusty’s head, hand slowly moving down his well-muscled back, fingers running through his soft fur. Unbeknownst to him, a small slit had opened just beneath his balls, sticky with Rusty’s precum.<br />
<br />
“Better?” Rusty’s voice was soft.<br />
<br />
Troy looked into Rusty’s soft blue eyes and felt butterflies fill him again. His athletic frame grew more dainty, muscles deflating, leaving him curvier. His breasts swelled another cup size. <br />
<br />
He nodded.<br />
<br />
Rusty moved slowly, hands moving to cup Troy’s thighs, pulling Troy closer to him, and then spread his legs.<br />
 <br />
“Lube?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
Rusty cocked his head, finger moving down below Troy’s oddly sensitive balls, rubbed something strangely sensitive. His finger came back wet and sticky. He smiled. <br />
<br />
“You’re wet enough, baby.”<br />
<br />
Troy blinked. “What do you-?”<br />
<br />
Rusty plunged into Troy’s taint again, the tip of his red rocket parting the small slit’s opening, pushing deeper.<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck!” Troy’s eyes rolled up in the back of his head as he came, his balls pulsing, spurt after spurt of cum, rocketing out of him.<br />
<br />
Rusty thrust again and again while Troy was lost in orgasmic bliss. His cock slipped further and further into Troy’s blooming slit. He barely noticed when Rusty thrusts pulled Troy’s testicles in, shoving them deeper, just a twinge of nausea and discomfort, like a bad case of blue balls.<br />
<br />
Troy’s cock grew smaller and thinner, drawing backwards, still ejaculating, though the fluid was clear and no longer the milky white of semen. It drew up and into the folds of Troy’s labia, Rusty’s thick dick rubbing against it as the veiny cock impaled itself to the hilt in her velvety folds.<br />
<br />
“Baby…” Troy gasped, her voice growing even more high pitched. “Oh…”<br />
<br />
She wound her legs around his lower back, holding him inside of her, enjoying the throb of him, his fullness. Her spine popped as her hips painlessly widened. He was so big, her pussy stretched around it. <br />
<br />
Troy looked down as Rusty pull out of her, A thick strand of pre connecting it to her glistening folds. <br />
<br />
“I love you.” Rusty breathed.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled, face softening, becoming more feminine as she met her husband’s eyes. A wedding dress appeared in the corner. He was so big compared to her, so manly.<br />
<br />
She needed him now, her groin hot and wet.<br />
<br />
“I love you too.” Troy ran her dainty paws along her husband’s arm, feeling his muscles, wrapping them around his neck. “Take me?”<br />
<br />
They kissed and Rusty’s cock parted her again. And again. Her slick inner muscles met his loving shaft and squeezed it.<br />
<br />
Rusty thrust faster and faster, Troi bucking back. Their exertions grew more and more frantic. She could feel herself growing closer to something, something that was truly final.<br />
<br />
And then she felt his knot smack against her netherlips. It was big, insistent, and Rusty shoved himself forward, the knot stretching his lips wider and wider. Tori whimpered, the knot rubbing her clit.<br />
<br />
Then the knot popped inside her and she clenched down involuntarily as her orgasm washed through her in luxurious waves. Her pussy clenched and squeezed and Rusty howled and his cock twitched and juddered, filling her needy hole with his seed.<br />
<br />
He lay on top of her, panting.<br />
<br />
Troi began to feel oddly bloated. <br />
<br />
Her stomach slowly swelled. Her tender nipples grew even more sensitive, expanding as they filled with milk. A stray brush of Rusty’s paws made her tits oddly wet and warm, something dripped down her sides.<br />
<br />
Rusty’s paws rubbed her distended stomach.<br />
<br />
“I can feel them kick!” Rusty exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Troi blinked. Rusty grabbed her hand and brought it to her stomach. She felt something bump against it. A puppy?<br />
<br />
Her stomach swelled more, and now she felt like she’d swallowed a beachball. <br />
<br />
“Doctor says you’re over due. Could be any day now.” Rusty was saying, his cock softening enough that he could pull out of her.<br />
<br />
A fresh burst of pain hit Troi as her water broke.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
RK watched from the house across the street as an ambulance carried a heavily pregnant woman away, her husband at her side, holding her hand.<br />
<br />
He left, whistling a happy tune, Book of Beasts in hand.</p>
