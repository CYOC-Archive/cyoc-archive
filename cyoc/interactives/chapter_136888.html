<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter found himself staring out into a black mass with glowing eyes, shrouded by what appeared to be a thick fog. Every instinct inside himself feeling vulnerable under its gaze, feeling like it was staring at something deep inside him. It squinted, like it was having trouble focusing, but then it turned to look him in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems I cannot yet bring your full self out completely, you have no magical energy of your own, so I&#39;ve almost nothing to draw from and nothing to work with... But that can easily be fixed,&quot; the entity seemed to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you? Where are we? What are you going to do to me?&quot; Peter asked in a flurry of questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am as a mirror to your soul, a mirror yet obscured, housed within an artefact... This is your sleeping mind... And I have already answered your third question, but it bears repeating... I will make your body reflect your inner self, good and ill&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter clutched a hand to his chest, suddenly feeling suffocated by the presence of what he knew was the medallion, but as he was asleep he couldn&#39;t touch it, so it was left as this weight that held him down. He thought about how he&#39;d taken it, how it must be what the entity referred to, and he realized something...<br />
<br />
… In stealing it he&#39;d probably damned himself to becoming some monster... And for a moment guilt washed over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Your moment of weakness is more akin to mischief than malice. You did it to spite her judgement of you, not for gain... The worst I could make you based on that alone would be an imp or a pixie... And bringing out such a lesser version of yourself is beneath me, certainly not unless I expect you to go further down that path.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entity continued to stare into his heart and soul, Peter squirming as best as he could within the constrictive dreamscape which felt like swimming through gel, hoping to wake himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Your kind seems to have gotten a lot of interest in more animalistic forms lately... Or perhaps only the ones considered noble... And you yourself are a student of ancient culture... Perhaps a &#39;Kitsune&#39; as your kind calls it would be suitable, at least until I can pierce further into your soul,&quot; the entity said, its cool presence and tone sending a chill up Peter&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
An image manifested inside the entity, somewhat clearer than the surroundings; a large twin-tailed fox, stretched out on all fours like the animal it was, and yet it had a tiny hint of human... A bit of added hair on its head that could be styled, a hint of a human shape to its main body, and as it frolicked he could see its round ass and a modest pair of breasts growing on its chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; Peter said, &quot;... A Kitsune&#39;s true form has always been... A girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entity seemed to chuckle. &quot;You think I don&#39;t know common it is to at least be curious about the other side... I know you&#39;ve been thinking about it, given your choice of erotic entertainment... The real question is whether or not that sticks, whether deep down you&#39;d truly prefer it, and unless you were already unhappy being a boy then it would be fairly hard for you to know for sure unless you tried it... And the way it stands right now, making you better understand yourself will help me see the real you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Peter knew what was going on, the scene faded into darkness, and soon rapid random images, then static... And the dream lost its lucidity.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Peter woke in a cold sweat, remembering that foreboding dream clearly, even as the psychology students would remind him that he should only be able to remember his last dream... And yet it felt so real.<br />
<br />
As he started to come to his senses, he felt a pair of appendages brushing against his sheets and his legs, curling up under his legs, the feel of the fur on it seeming quite nice, but as he registered the shock he threw off the covers of his bed.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, he saw two light cream furred foxtails, curled up under him as if to protect his sex, already hidden behind the boxer shorts he wore to bed; a point that in light of the dream, and these new tails, and the fact the boxers didn&#39;t seem to be touching his junk the way it normally would made him worried about what he might have lost.<br />
<br />
With a reluctant hand, he slipped under the band and felt a shiver just from touching his pubic hair, which felt soft and fluffy rather than the course rough mess that should have been there. Rather than feeling himself grow hard, he instead felt something a little lower and tucked a little inside himself begin to swell and grow moist. That was enough for &#39;him&#39; to know what it was, &#39;he&#39; was now a she... And part of her conscious mind wanted to leave that exploration there, to be fine just knowing that she had what was there... But for some reason she couldn&#39;t find the will to pull away... Instead she petted the patch of fur lining her crotch, like giving a dog a scratch behind the ears, and slowly her hand lowered.<br />
<br />
When she finally rubbed against the lips of her vagina itself, she let out a surprised yip and pulled away. She was more sensitive down there than she had any right to be, word was the clit was supposed to be that sensitive, not the whole thing. She couldn&#39;t help but grumble and assume this was the medallion assuming that the &#39;real&#39; her would prefer it more sensitive than normal. Still she didn&#39;t find the that bad just... A little overwhelming...<br />
<br />
She shook her head realizing she was just accepting this form. Even if she ended up liking this form, most girls aren&#39;t attracted to other girls so she&#39;d have the worst luck trying to date them, and she couldn&#39;t be attracted to boys even if she wanted to be.<br />
<br />
Something about that struck home... If she really was a girl... Was she destined to be lonely? She&#39;d heard stories around campus from both the lesbians there and some of the social science majors that a lot of lesbians had some of the most rough relationships, many of them pairing together only because they had the same attraction only for it to fail since they had nothing in common, not to mention how many became abusive.<br />
<br />
She looked down at the medallion, its form having turned into the teardrop shape of a magatama. It remained silent on her woes, but she had a feeling if she was still in that dream it might say that it cared little for how others reacted to her, or how it affected her relationships or her relationship prospects.<br />
<br />
He thought about ripping the medallion off, but she wasn&#39;t exactly able to change her situation without it, she had to make it find some part of her still attached to being a boy... Outside of the romantic prospects perhaps.<br />
<br />
Looking up at a mirror, she saw herself, certainly more slender and having somewhat girly hips and narrow shoulders... But as she lifted the shirt she wore to bed, it was clear she was still flat chested for now... Only to notice she had an extra three pairs of nipples running down her abs, giving her eight nipples total... Dropping it, she noticed a cute pair of fox ears on her head, and between her hair and her face she swore she looked kind of tomboyish... But it wasn&#39;t quite her normal self, though she could maybe pass as her own sister.<br />
<br />
She sighed to herself. &quot;How am I supposed to hide changes like this from everyone? Even if I hide the fox parts i&#39;d-&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;oh, hide? Not try to convince them you&#39;re still you despite the changes?&#39; the voice from the dream echoed in her mind.<br />
<br />
She froze for a moment. Unsure whether it was actually talking to her or not, and wondering if it would only answer her if she spoke aloud.<br />
<br />
&#39;pay me no mind,&#39; the voice continued, &#39;if you wish to hide it, you certainly have enough magic of your own now to do something so trivial, to make others see you as you were... Or you could convince them that magic is real with those same powers, and prove you very well could have changed like this... If you have friends you want in on this secret you could certainly let them in on it... Maybe loan me to someone you trust if you believe it would be fun to see what they become.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment &#39;Peter&#39; began to consider some of those options, some of them were an amusing thought... She shook her head and tried to remain composed. &quot;No fair, I didn&#39;t even know I had such a mischievous side before you showed up, you don&#39;t get to manipulate me by trying to appeal to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice laughed. &#39;Was that pride I heard? Interesting...&#39;<br />
<br />
Peter half expected to hear the medallion&#39;s voice continue, only to be met with the silent treatment... Long enough that she heard a knock on her door, likely her roommate. Part of her froze up as she tried to think of how to handle this... Each option making her question what she wanted, and what the medallion might do to her for each choice. She ran out of time when the door opened on its own, and she ended up acting instinctually...</p>
