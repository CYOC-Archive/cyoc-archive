<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well. With the ring,” Skylar began, “it could do stuff randomly, so we ask it to do something and make it vague, then it should be random, right?” She says, “wow I do feel a lot smarter,”<br />
<br />
“I guess that makes sense, but just-” you say before getting cut off,<br />
“Great! What can we do first, and how should I phrase it... ooh!” She says, “alright, I wish that both of us will grow in one place on our bodies!” She finishes,<br />
You can only see this going wrong. But before any ideas of what could happen pop into your head, it begins. <br />
<br />
You see Skylar’s face go from excited to moaning almost. It was at this moment that you looked down at her tank top, at her breasts. Her nipples looked hard, not only were they hard, but they were getting bigger. They looked like they were getting thicker and longer. As they did, the top tented more and more. Skylar was now officially moaning at it, she grabbed them with her hands, you saw her slip her hands under her shirt and begin tweaking them. They must’ve been over 2 centimetres long by now. Then it occurred to you, you didn’t feel your nipples growing. You look down, they weren’t. God were these jeans always this tight?<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” you say to yourself. You bend yourself down and look at your crotch. It wasn’t your dick, but your balls. They were growing. Bigger and bigger. Your jeans were pushing on them, making it really uncomfortable, restricting. You couldn’t deal with the pressure, you unbuckled your jeans and slid them off, leaving only your underwear. You looked at yourself as your balls grew. You couldn’t see them as clear as possible, but they were big alright. They must’ve been the size of a fist each, and still growing. You watched them grow bigger and bigger. They grew to the size of apples, maybe even oranges, bigger than you could grab with one hand, before you heard Skylar yell,<br />
<br />
“I wish we’d stop growing!” She yelled. Suddenly, the growth stopped. You looked at your stretched underwear and saw the two large sacks, they didn’t feel too great in your underwear but no way were you going to take them off in front of Skylar.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Skylar yelled, she pointed at your balls, “wow, you took your jeans off... for me!?” She joked, going over to grab it,<br />
“Hey!” You shout, grabbing her hand and pushing it away from you,<br />
“What gives! Nobody else is here.”<br />
“Yeah... I don’t want you seeing my balls,” it was at this point that you noticed Skylar’s tank top. Her nipples protruded about an inch and a half, maybe two, from her tank top, they could take your eye out if she wasn’t careful.<br />
<br />
“Well, dammit, I wanted to...” she stopped, “let’s make it fair,” she said, she grabbed her tank top and slid it over her head. You had a full view of her nipples now, even her breasts. Her nipples were as long as they looked, they were like tiny cylinders. Her areoles were the size of the palm of your hand, they rose up before the nipple stood out.<br />
<br />
“Look, you’ve seen my tits, and my huge nipples... holy shit...” she got distracted by herself, then she shook herself out of it, “yeah... what was I saying? Oh yeah, you’ve seen my nipples, so I get to see your... Uhh... whatever you call them,”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, fine,” you say, trying to take your eyes away from her, you succeed, “and don’t expect me to let you touch them,” Skylar frowned. You slowly grab the side of your underwear and slide it down your legs. Your balls are always touching the fabric. You lower them down until they are off. They drop them in the floor.<br />
<br />
Skylar is looking at them in disbelief. She crouches down to look at they dangling. You almost wished you were in her shoes just to see what it looked like. <br />
<br />
“God. They are massive, and...” she pauses, she puts her hands to her mouth and begins to laugh, trying to hide it,<br />
“W-What!?” You say, concerned, why wasn’t she laughing before, was it your pubic hair or something,<br />
“No... I just...” she couldn’t speak while trying to hold in her laughter, “your penis!” She said.<br />
You almost felt your whole life flash before your eyes.<br />
“So what!” You shout, “it’s never bothered me...” you begin to get defensive, your face gets a little red,<br />
<br />
“No...” she is still laughing, “it’s not that...” she calms herself down, she is holding herself up with one hand on the side of her bed, “it’s bigger than Liams!” She starts laughing again, less intense,<br />
“What!?” You say. You’re beyond confused. No way was your dick bigger than Liam Eric, “you’re kidding me...”<br />
“Nope,” she was now more composed, still a smile on her face, “I just can’t believe that you, of all people, have a bigger dick than him. I mean, his dick isn’t massive or anything... well... actually... wow his really is small isn’t it,” she says to herself,<br />
“Well you should see it when it’s erect,” you say with your sudden boost of confidence. Hearing yourself out loud you realise what you said,<br />
“Oh?” She says, now not smiling anymore, her face a look of genuine intrigue.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t mean that in any way... like...” you try and dig yourself out of the hole you’ve gotten stuck in,<br />
“No, no... it’s fine... but I mean...” she says, you can tell she’s thinking, “how about we make a deal...” she says, “I’ll put us both back to normal... if I can make your dick hard? Just to see what it looks like. I won’t touch it or anything, I just want to see it,”<br />
“Well... I mean...” you stop to think too, “okay. As well as that, because I know you’re not doing to give me the ring anytime soon. You have to make wishes when I ask you to, and it doesn’t matter what, got it,”<br />
“Hmm... I would take your offer... but if you want that... then I guess I’m gonna have to be able to touch you too. Anywhere I want.”<br />
<br />
“So?” She asks you, “is that what you want to do?”</p>
