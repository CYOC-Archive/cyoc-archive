<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After much deliberation, Emily decided she needed to talk to Rick about this. Not just to have a start in changing reality back to normal, but for both of their sakes: hers in having someone who already knew about the camera to talk to about all this and his in restoring his lost memories and personality. She was glad to have done this for the novelty of having a different life and seeing how circumstances could so easily change for people like her parents depending on the situation, and she was definitely going to continue using the camera in the future for stuff like this. Now, though, it was time for things to return to relative normalcy. Well...so she hoped and expected...<br />
<br />
She began to look around for her former boyfriend, occasionally looking down at the camera to double-check the settings. However, unlike her previous house, this new one wasn&#39;t easy to find people in at all. It wasn&#39;t only the unfamiliarity of traversing a new place, but also how expansive this mansion actually was. Rooms upon rooms upon rooms -- it was a labyrinth! <br />
<br />
Occasionally she saw other staff doing their duties to ask for some sense of direction. Emily recognized some them as Paul&#39;s many acquaintances in his old life, now working under him as butlers and maids, with the others probably being people from Rebecca&#39;s past. Their attire was notable in not being as traditional or revealing as Olivia&#39;s, likely due to preference in not finding such outfits as attractive as she did. Emily&#39;s face flushed as that realization set in learning one of her mom&#39;s kinks, though that didn&#39;t distract her from her main goal. They were a bit less friendly than Olivia was, with Emily noticing their many cues to push her to do something else. Not to mention less helpful than she expected, with them skirting around her actual question on where her &#39;parents&#39; were, as if they knew not to be bothered. Her unease grew with each interaction, but she pressed on.<br />
<br />
It was taking her minutes to make any sort of headway given that the staff assumed she lived here all her life and knew her way around generally speaking which of course in this reality, she had...alongside. The young woman turned young teen&#39;s face transitioned into a scowl, about to shout out for someone to show her where they were...that was until she heard cheers in one particular room upstairs, further off than expected. The cheers of the husky-voiced MILF Rebecca. With caution, Emily jogged towards the sounds. Her face grew increasingly pale as she realized what she was shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Fuck yes! Come on, come on...&quot;<br />
<br />
No...they couldn&#39;t be. God, if wasn&#39;t sure Rick was going to kill her before, she was positive he would now. She had inadvertently led him to fucking her dad! There&#39;s no way she was going to turn his awareness on in the middle of that, but at the same time would holding off until they were &#39;finished&#39; really any better? She didn&#39;t know. Too many thoughts were filling her head...like her dad was probably filling him...her. She gulped as that thought crossed her mind. She reached the door. The joyous cries barely held from behind the fancy, white door. Her dainty hand pulled down on the handle a little. Unlocked. The curiosity was too strong. She had to know. She pushed the entrance open with a subdued creak.<br />
<br />
Emily took a glimpse into the master bedroom -- it was indeed Rebecca shouting out those proclamations. However, she could see the mother was holding a video game controller and looking intently at the screen all the while. Yes, part of Rebecca&#39;s screaming was from her bombastic competitiveness, inherited from when she was Rick. Emily let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
That is to say she almost did before looking at the situation closer, gulping when her attention drifted to the bed. <br />
<br />
Paul was lounging with a wide smile on his face -- his &#39;wife&#39; sitting on him...or more specifically, his crotch. Both were nude below the waist. She could see Paul&#39;s beer belly, which had grown over the years. She could see the bottom of Rebecca&#39;s prominent 6-pack. She could see the inklings of her dad&#39;s member...being pressed within her &#39;mother&#39;s&#39; ass.<br />
<br />
Each time Rebecca made a swift move in the game, she rose her cheeks up, only to plop it back onto Paul&#39;s fully erect cock a second later. There wasn&#39;t even enough time for the soft round cheeks to stop jiggling before Rebecca repeated the process.<br />
<br />
Dodge. Plap. <br />
<br />
Strike. Plap. <br />
<br />
Emily shut the door. Plap. <br />
<br />
She looked towards the camera and walked away. She needed something -- anything -- to distract her from this. Paul really was fucking her former boyfriend...Rick was being fucked in his now feminine bubble butt...all while gaming without a care in the world. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph...h-hey, baby, you&#39;re...ngh...doing great, but...hah...maybe we should quiet down a little?&quot; Paul moaned out as he felt his rod getting worked on by his wonderful wife&#39;s rump.<br />
<br />
She sat especially hard on the next go around, though Paul couldn&#39;t tell if it was deliberate or simply adrenaline from the game. Paul held her waist as his sex drive grew before his college sweetheart answered. &quot;Emily&#39;s fine! She&#39;s...come ahn~...probably texting her friends or...uhn...playing...or the maids are...oh wait! Come on, just one more!&quot; The woman who was previously Rick, shouted before landing the last blow on the final boss! She cheered and nearly tossed the controller out of her hands as she shot up again. As she descended, Paul reached his own climax, shooting out a massive load. The woman&#39;s eyes glazed over, drooling for a few seconds as the cum entered her rear. Husband and wife moaned in unison. Paul was grateful not only that Rebecca was on birth control but that she liked anal so much; otherwise, he&#39;d have no idea how many kids they&#39;d have at this point.<br />
<br />
Rebecca soon regained her composure, slapping Paul&#39;s hairy thigh and looking behind with a sly smirk. &quot;You&#39;re damn lucky you did that *after* I won.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul maintained his wide grin, beginning to fondle what he just ejaculated in. &quot;You call it luck, I call it experience,&quot; he cooed, lifting himself up and nibbling her ear. <br />
<br />
Rebecca bit her lip, looking at the game that awaited its ending. &quot;Yeah, well, you&#39;re *experienced* in distracting me from finishing these things.&quot; She pulled off her blouse and began undoing the bra holding in her massive jugs. Paul began to fondle those next. &quot;And *lucky* to be so damn charismatic~&quot;. The woman giggled, as giddy as she was in her college days as her hubby pleasured her. God, she loved him so much...how often they did this, even after all these years. Only recently did she truly appreciate that. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s why she stopped taking her pill. <br />
<br />
She still loved being fucked in the ass, but she yearned to bear another one of his children, to have her womb filled, to feel like a young mama again~! She hoped it was another girl. She thought Emily would like that too.</p>
