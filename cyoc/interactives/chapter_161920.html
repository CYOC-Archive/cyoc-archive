<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My name is Samuel Millers. My father and I were on our way back from one of his big business trips.  He’s the right hand man of the CEO of a business firm up in the city.  He couldn’t get someone to watch me on such short notice so he brought me with him on his most recent trip.<br />
<br />
We were heading home when our car broke down.  My father was clearly frustrated at our predicament so I knew it was better to stay quiet.  <br />
<br />
“Stupid rental! To think they only had this model,  it came out LAST year. No wonder the stupid thing gave out on us.”<br />
<br />
“Howdy there! You folks need help?”<br />
<br />
I turned to see a boy around my age, maybe a little younger.  He had reddish-brown hair that poked out from the front of his cap backward facing cap and a face covered in light freckles.  He was wearing washed out denim overalls over a green plaid shirt.<br />
<br />
“I guess you could say that.” My father replied.<br />
<br />
“Let’s getcha out of this heat first.  Follow me!” He happily said.<br />
<br />
The boy led us to a big red barn deep in the corn fields.  We went to the house right by it where he introduced us to his father.  He was tall, strong  looking man with a mustache and a scruffy beard.<br />
<br />
“Hello, we seem to have broken down about a mile back, may we use your phone?” My father said.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid the lines out here are down.  But I got a buddy who’s farm ain’t too far from here, he can take a look at your wheels and fix it.  You’re more that welcome to stay here till it’s fixed up.”<br />
<br />
My father looked irritated but thanked the kind man for his hospitality. <br />
<br />
“So what’s your name?”<br />
<br />
I turned again to see the boy we met earlier. <br />
<br />
“Uh Samuel, I’m 14.” I said.<br />
<br />
“Sam huh?  My names Billy, I’m 12. I reckon I can show you round the place if you’d like.”<br />
<br />
I looked towards my father who gave a quick nod of approval before he discussed temporary living arrangements with Billy’s dad. <br />
<br />
“We don’t get many city folks ‘round these parts.”  Billy said picking up what looked like a huge metal jug more than half his size.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that heavy?  I asked.<br />
<br />
“Not when you’re used to doin it every day.  I always carry the milk out of the barn.”  He happily replied.<br />
<br />
I was utterly fascinated with Billy’s lifestyle.  He didn’t seem to have a care in the world, and did things I couldn’t imagine a kid his age being so experienced in.  He showed me all around his farm.<br />
<br />
When he was showing me the horses I caught sight of another person.  He looked to be in his late teens if not twenty.  I wanted to ask Billy about him but he was so caught up in naming each and every horse that I didn’t want to interrupt him.<br />
<br />
Billy eventually showed my father to the spare room they had in the house. <br />
<br />
“You can sleep in my room Sam, I’ll just head to barn.” Billy told me.<br />
<br />
“You sleep in the barn?!” I said in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Trust me, it’s not as bad as it sounds.  I have and old mattress and some stuff on the second floor.” He leaned in and whispered. “I doze off there sometimes when my Pa isn’t looking.  Come lemme show ya.”<br />
<br />
With that we made our way to the barn.<br />
<br />
“It looks like a tree house or something.” I noted.<br />
<br />
“I tried to make it really comfy-like.  You’re welcome to sleep here too if ya like.  Lemme just get a spare blanket.”<br />
<br />
I got so caught up looking at every last detail in the barn that I didn’t notice Billy was gone for a long time.  <br />
<br />
I heard a splash right outside and was shocked back to reality.  <br />
<br />
I ran out of the barn to see if someone had gotten hurt.  That’s when I saw one of the most odd sights.  <br />
<br />
Billy, in no more than his underwear,  completely head-to-toe in mud.  That’s not all, the stable hand from earlier was there as well!  He wasn’t nearly as muddy as Billy and was wearing a torn wifebeater, boots, and some old boxers.<br />
<br />
The two were struggling against each other.  I couldn’t believe Billy wasn’t actually holding his own pretty well for a bit.  The older one eventually won the little brawl.<br />
<br />
“Nice try squirt.” He said smiling and helping Billy up.<br />
<br />
“I almost gotcha that time!” Billy said shaking off the mud.  He saw me and waved goodbye to the stable hand.<br />
<br />
“What were you two doing?!” I asked<br />
<br />
“Mud wrestling!  That there is my big brother Todd.  He’s nineteen.”<br />
<br />
I tried to hide my boner.  Something about these two brothers was so hot.  Billy tried to shake some more mud off and splashed some on me.<br />
<br />
“Sorry ‘bout the wait.  I was trying to look for a blanket and Tod challenged me to a quick wrestlin’ match.  I best get started on washing up.”<br />
<br />
Billy cleaned himself up and came back to the barn to introduce me to what he called “a good friend of his.”<br />
<br />
“Sam, meet Blubs!”  Billy then revealed a baby piglet.<br />
<br />
“He was a runt but Pa let me keep em, wanna hold him?”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?  What if I-” <br />
<br />
“Quit your worryin’ he’s harmless!”<br />
Billy carefully placed the little guy in my arms.<br />
<br />
“He’s... really cute.” I thought to myself.<br />
<br />
Billy and I spent the rest of the afternoon setting up my spot in the barn.  We talked all about life and I answered some of his questions about “the big city.” <br />
<br />
“You really think all the stuff I do looks interestin?” He grinned.<br />
<br />
“More than you can imagine.” I told him a bit embarrassed.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, well come on I’ll show ya something ya might like.”  <br />
<br />
“But it’s the middle of the night, what if we encounter coyotes or something?”<br />
<br />
“There ya go, worryin’ again.  Don’t worry, no coyotes would be caught dead where we’re headin.” He laughed.<br />
<br />
He then led me down the woods holding a rusty lantern.<br />
<br />
“There’s a old legend about this lake or something deep in the woods.  Pa told me never to go near it but me and Tod came out here once.” Billy turned to face me and held the lamp up to his face.<br />
<br />
“It’s called swap swamp.  It’s makes people swap bodies.  Me and Tod came here when I was 8.  We swapped for a whole month and Pa never knew!”<br />
<br />
“Wait are you serious?”<br />
<br />
“Dead serious.” He said, his usual happy-go-lucky smile replaced with a blank expression.  <br />
<br />
“Why did you two stay switched for so long?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I really wanted to be big enough help Pa around the farm and Tod wanted a break.  We had our fun and then snuck back here when the harvest season was over.”<br />
<br />
Billy pushed aside some tall bushes as we made our way to what seemed like a secluded lake.  You couldn’t even see the sky with all the trees overhead. <br />
<br />
“So how does it work?”  I asked anxiously.<br />
<br />
“First things first, we both gotta get nice and nude.”<br />
<br />
To my surprise, Billy began to take off his clothes right then and there!<br />
<br />
His skin was naturally pale but slightly tanned from all the time he spent outside.  As he stripped I noticed his freckles weren’t limited to his face.  His entire body was coated in a dusting of freckles.  <br />
<br />
When he finished taking off his overalls and underwear I tried to avert my eyes from the obvious, but it was too tempting.  <br />
<br />
My jaw nearly dropped.  This kid was hung for his age!  His 5 inch flaccid cock looked almost silly on his 12 year old body.  It wasn’t a skinny penis either.  It looked like puberty was just starting for Billy and it all started right there.<br />
<br />
“So whaddya say?  Wanna take a dip in the swamp with me?”</p>
