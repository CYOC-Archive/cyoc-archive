<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hah...&quot; Bob Roberts sighed as he finished changing his 10 month old son Colin. At the moment, he was all alone with his son. His wife was at work. Meanwhile Bob had lost his job some months before. The company he worked at was near bankruptcy and thus they had to lay the 32 year old off to prop up the struggling business. That made his wife the breadwinner for the foreseeable future, while he searched for jobs online. But even that was being prevented, by his son&#39;s constant need for care. &quot;Dada!&quot; Colin simply let out one of the only two words he knew. Bob looked at his son and flashed a wry smile. Taking care of his son was exhausting, but he could never hate him at the very least. &quot;Still... I wish he could at least let me continue my job searching in peace.&quot; <br />
<br />
Just as he said that, Bob&#39;s phone buzzed with a text message. Thinking it was about one of his jobs, he opened it up. &quot;What the...&quot; But on his phone was some weird advertisement. &quot;Wish Granting App?&quot;  he thought out loud. Below those words it said... &quot;Need some help? The Wish Granting App is here the grant anything your heart desires. Download now free of charge.&quot; &quot;Great, just what I needed. Spam mail.&quot; Bob went to put the number on the spam list and delete the text, but paused for a second. &quot;This is silly... This is silly, but...&quot; Admittedly, simple curiosity got the best of him. He checked to see if the app was okay to download. &quot;I guess it can&#39;t hurt to at least try it out.&quot; Bob downloaded the app and was sent to the homepage. &quot;Just type in your wish and in ten seconds it shall be granted,&quot; was all it said. &quot;Okay then... Seems simple enough.&quot; Bob thought of what to put in. &quot;Let&#39;s just start out simple, just to see if it really works.&quot; He thought some more and then typed in what he wanted. &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t need to constantly look after my son Colin.&quot; Thinking that that was enough, Bob then hit send. The timer just below counted down from 10. &quot;This really is stupid, but oh well.&quot; Five seconds were left. &quot;Dada?&quot; Colin looked at his father and asked. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Colin. Nothing will happen.&quot; As Bob said that the timer hit 0. Several more seconds passed with nothing happening. &quot;Sigh... I knew this was a waste of time... Guess I&#39;ll just delete it...&quot; But before Bob could do so, his phone let out a bright light. &quot;Ahh!&quot; Bob let out a shout as he dropped the phone. The shining lasted for a few more seconds, but then started to reside. &quot;What was that about?&quot; Bob scratched his head and picked up his phone, placing it on the nightstand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dada?&quot; Colin called out again. &quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry son. Just my phone... Hmm?&quot; Bob looked towards his son and noticed something was off. He could have swore his feet only reached halfway on the crib, but now it looked like they stretched, about two thirds of the way now. &quot;I must be misremembering things because of that light. He placed his hands on the crib. &quot;What?!&quot; But when he did, he noticed the sleeves on his sweatshirt were slightly bunched up at the end. He let got of the crib and his sleeves went downwards covering up to the bottom of his fingers and they were covering his hand more and more. &quot;What&#39;s going on here?!&quot; Bob looked towards his son again and noticed that his feet were close to the edge of the crib, but what&#39;s more was that he no longer looked like a 10 month old. The hair on his head had grown and he was losing his baby fat little by little. He looked to be about 3 to 4 years old now. His son was getting older by the second. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening!&quot; he thought. He turned towards the mirror to his side and let out a small shout. It wasn&#39;t too noticeable, but he looked a little younger than he did before. Traces of his unshaven facial hair vanished from his skin. The bottoms of his sweatpants had pooled over his bare feet and his sleeves had covered his hands completely. He looked to be about in his late twenties. Bob turned towards his son once more. His feet were pressed against the crib and he looked to be in a bit of discomfort. Bob rolled up his sleeves and picked Colin up, placing him on a couch on the side. He felt heavier to hold and looked like a small child of seven now. His diapers were straining on his growing pelvis.  &quot;There&#39;s just no way!&quot; Bob looked towards the mirror again. He was in shock. He looked like he was 25. The neckline of his shirt was widening under his shrinking upper body. He shook it and saw that his sleeves were a quarter of the way up his arms. The waistline of his sweats felt loose as if they were about to fall off his body completely. He fumbled to take off his sweatshirt and after some difficultly was able to do so. <br />
<br />
&quot;God!&quot; was all Bob could say. He was losing musculature fast. His eight pack abs were shrinking into his body, while his pectorals sagged a bit. Soon his pants slid right off, his boxers continued to slightly hold due to his dick, which pulsed with an erection he hadn&#39;t felt since he was in college. He looked to be just about twenty now himself. &quot;Snap&quot; Bob looked away from his own changes to see that the diaper on Colin had snapped right off, revealing a penis that couldn&#39;t have belonged to a baby boy. &quot;Ah,ha,hee,hee!&quot; Colin looking about twelve years old now. He let out a joyful laugh and wiggled his body. Evidently, while he was getting older, his mental age hadn&#39;t changed at all. He continued to grow too big for even the sofa, but he was able to move his legs upwards. Bob could see then growing hairs as his feet bulked up. Colin looked to be about fifteen and his body was reacting like such. &quot;Holy... shit!&quot; Bob couldn&#39;t help but curse in front of his son as he went through a quickened puberty. His penis about four inches soft, grew erect immediately. It pulsed with a young teen&#39;s vigor at a solid nine inches. His testicles dropped, becoming the size of golf balls. &quot;Waa!&quot; Colin cried out in joy as he touched it with a child like curiosity. &quot;No Colin! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; But before Bob could stop him, Colin&#39;s dick shook violently as he ejaculated. The cum splattering over his body and the sofa. &quot;Uhh! Uhh! Uhhhhhh!&quot; Colin made several moans as his first erection subsided. At that point Colin looked to be about seventeen. <br />
<br />
Oh my god! My son... My 10 month old son just became a man!&quot; Bob teared up as he continued to shrink. He was about seventeen himself now and Colin looked eighteen, meaning that Colin was now the oldest physically. Bob&#39;s dick could no loner hold up his boxers as they fell to the ground. His own dick was nearly at its limits. &quot;No... I mustn&#39;t... I need to set a good example for my son... for my son.&quot; But Bob could no longer contain himself. He turned around and began pumping his dick furiously. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... So Good!! Oh so fucking good!&quot; Bob was transported to the time when he had gotten his first erection. He was a late bloomer, so he didn&#39;t have one until he was fifteen himself. &quot;Ah,ah,ah... AHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; Bob let loose as he cummed a huge load staining the mirror that captured him shrinking to thirteen years old. Eventually he stopped and his dick went flaccid, never to be erect again. In slight ecstasy, Bob turned back towards Colin. He was now clearly in his twenties; about 22. Facial hair was growing as a bushel of hair covered his testicles. His penis was a good six inches soft. &quot;My son&#39;s gonna grow up to be a fucking monster!&quot; he thought as an eight pack formed on his body and his pectoral hardened. A treasure trail came up from his pelvis and spread out on his pecs. Bob could see he was growing a decent amount of armpit hair too. At the moment, Colin now looked to be about 26. Bob turned around as a little boy faced him. But it was him as the drizzle of precum shown. His tummy was starting to stick out and his body hair was all gone. &quot;I must be at least eight now. Oh!&quot; Bob touched his neck, trying to feel for his Adam&#39;s Apple. It was there, but faint, as the young kid&#39;s voice that came out of his mouth could testify. As for Colin, besides an increase in body hair and some extra musculature, his growing up was almost done. He was about 30 now. As Bob realized that, his legs began to buckle. &quot;Woah! Ahh!&quot; Bob looked ahead at the baby staring at him. &quot;Holy shit! Woah!&quot; Bob lost control of his legs completely as he fell face first in his own cum. &quot;Yuck! Gross!&quot; Bob flailed around and with some struggle was able to move out of the way. As he did, his baby fat returned to him. He was about one now and then a split second later, was now Colin&#39;s 10 months old. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dada?&quot; Bob turned towards the voice to see Colin now 32 years old, but still a baby in mind, getting off the couch. He struggled to maintain balance, but was able to use pure leg muscle to stand up straight. &quot;Good lord!&quot; Bob said. Even thought he was 10 months old, he could still talk completely. &quot;Well fuck,&quot; he said; the curse words sounding weird coming out of a baby&#39;s voice. &quot;Dada?&quot; Colin repeated. &quot;Hngh!&quot; Then he grunted as he pooped onto the floor. &quot;Well how will I explain this to my wife?&quot; Bob thought as Colin played with his penis in the background.</p>
