<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a round of laughter and posing in their superhero outfits, Macy wandered further into the store, scanning the racks with a glimmer in her eye. Suddenly, she gasped.<br />
<br />
“Jess! Oh my god, come here!” Macy called, waving her over.<br />
<br />
Jess, still tugging at the slightly-too-tight Wonder Woman top, rolled her eyes. “What now, Macy?”<br />
<br />
Macy held up a pair of white, flowing wedding dresses. They sparkled under the mall lights, clearly made for prom-season displays but styled unmistakably like bridal gowns. “Let’s try these on next!”<br />
<br />
Jess blinked. “You have got to be kidding. A wedding dress? We already look ridiculous enough as maids and superheroes.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, it&#39;ll be hilarious!” Macy beamed. “Besides, these look gorgeous. It’s not like we’re actually getting married—we’re just goofing around!”<br />
<br />
Jess hesitated. “...You’re sure no one will see us?”<br />
<br />
“Just me,” Macy said with a wink. “And I’ll even let you pick which one you want first.”<br />
<br />
Jess sighed, her resistance slipping again. “Fine. But after this, we are getting smoothies or something and pretending none of this ever happened.”<br />
<br />
“You got it, bride-to-be!” Macy laughed, handing one dress to Jess and keeping the other for herself.<br />
<br />
The girls went back into the dressing rooms, stripped down again, and carefully pulled on the dresses. Each gown fit them unnaturally well, like it had been tailored for them. Jess’s was sleeveless and form-fitting with a modest slit down one side; Macy’s had delicate lace sleeves and a short train that brushed the floor.<br />
<br />
Jess stepped out first this time, awkwardly holding the skirt so she didn’t trip. Macy followed, hands clasped in front of her, beaming as she spun. “We look amazing!”<br />
<br />
“This is insane…” Jess muttered, unable to deny the elegance of the fabric, the way it hugged her new curves. She glanced at Macy. “So what now? Throw fake bouquets and say vows?”<br />
<br />
Before Macy could reply—<br />
<br />
“Well, well, well…” came a voice from behind them.<br />
<br />
Jess turned, eyes going wide. Billy and Ryan were standing there, now dressed in tuxedos, smug grins plastered across their faces.<br />
<br />
Ryan adjusted his tie. “Ladies. Hope we’re not late for the ceremony.”<br />
<br />
Billy gave a mock bow. “Which one of us gets to be the lucky groom?”<br />
<br />
Jess’s jaw dropped. “What the hell are you doing here dressed like that?”<br />
<br />
Macy’s eyes narrowed. “Were you following us?”<br />
<br />
Ryan shrugged. “Let’s just say we got invited to the wedding... by fate.”<br />
<br />
Jess’s mind was racing. Something’s off. They keep showing up, dressed exactly to match our outfits. Almost like…<br />
<br />
Macy, seemingly unfazed, took Jess’s hand and said jokingly, “Well then, I guess we better practice our first dance, huh?”<br />
<br />
Jess turned beet red. “Don’t push your luck.”<br />
<br />
Jess wanted to slap them. Hard.<br />
She clenched her fist and took a sharp breath as Ryan stepped forward with that smug look like he owned the mall—and apparently the moment too.<br />
<br />
But just before she could unleash her fury, she noticed Macy.<br />
<br />
Macy&#39;s posture had changed. Her expression had softened, dreamy even. She wasn’t glaring or rolling her eyes like she normally would. No—Macy had her hands delicately resting on her bouquet (wait, bouquet?), and her eyes were glistening.<br />
<br />
“Macy…?” Jess asked warily.<br />
<br />
Macy didn’t answer. She was staring forward, lips curled in a soft smile, like she was walking down the aisle of an actual wedding. Jess looked down—and realized Macy was holding a bouquet. And so was she.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is going on—” Jess started, but then she felt Ryan’s hand wrap gently around her waist, guiding her forward.<br />
<br />
Her whole body tensed.<br />
<br />
Her breath caught.<br />
<br />
And then… something warm bloomed in her chest. Like butterflies.<br />
<br />
Her face went bright red. Why was her heart beating like this? This was Ryan. He was annoying, smug, immature—and yet… the way he was holding her felt… right?<br />
<br />
Her steps suddenly matched Macy’s as they were led by the boys—no, their grooms?—out of the store and into the main corridor of the mall. But the mall didn’t look the same anymore. It had changed.<br />
<br />
The fluorescent lights had dimmed.<br />
<br />
White rose petals were scattered on the floor.<br />
<br />
A soft instrumental tune—something classical and romantic—played over the loudspeakers.<br />
<br />
Ahead of them was a makeshift wedding altar, complete with ribbons, candles, and chairs filled with mannequins dressed as wedding guests. A smiling mall employee—wearing a judge’s robe, for some reason—stood behind the altar like an officiant.<br />
<br />
Jess blinked rapidly, trying to ground herself.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”<br />
<br />
But when she looked to her side and saw Macy clutching Billy’s arm with utter sincerity, and Ryan’s hand squeezing hers gently in reassurance, it felt like all resistance in her mind… faded.<br />
<br />
The judge-like officiant spoke. “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of these two couples…”<br />
<br />
Jess tried to speak, tried to say no, to scream that something was wrong, but the words wouldn&#39;t come. Her lips parted—then closed again.<br />
<br />
Ryan leaned in and whispered softly in her ear, “You look beautiful, Jess. I can’t believe this day is finally here.”<br />
<br />
Her knees weakened. Her head swam. And before she could even think of pulling away, she found herself stepping forward, standing at the altar.<br />
<br />
The words washed over her: vows, honor, cherish, till death do us part.<br />
<br />
This isn’t real. This isn’t real.<br />
<br />
But it felt real.<br />
<br />
And when Ryan turned to face her and gently lifted her veil, Jess could feel tears stinging the corners of her eyes.<br />
<br />
He leaned in.<br />
<br />
Jess didn’t move.<br />
<br />
Her lips parted<br />
<br />
Ryan leaned in slowly, his eyes soft and uncharacteristically sincere.<br />
<br />
Jess’s heart pounded like a drum inside her chest.<br />
This isn&#39;t happening… this isn&#39;t me...<br />
And yet, her lips trembled as they met his.<br />
<br />
Just a kiss. Just one kiss.<br />
It was supposed to be quick.<br />
<br />
But the moment their lips touched, something snapped—or maybe shifted. Jess’s thoughts blurred, like watercolors bleeding into each other. The confusion, the defiance, the urge to scream—all melted away beneath a sudden, overwhelming warmth.<br />
<br />
The kiss ended.<br />
<br />
And Jess looked up at Ryan—her husband—with wide, dazed eyes.<br />
<br />
Applause rang out. Macy was clinging to Billy’s arm now, resting her head on his shoulder, smiling in that dreamy, dopey way she’d never shown before. They kissed too, and the applause grew louder. From where? She didn’t know. It just was.<br />
<br />
Jess clung to Ryan’s hand as the officiant announced, “You may now begin your new lives together as husband and wife.”<br />
<br />
Ryan turned to her and smiled. “Let’s go, Mrs. Walker.”<br />
<br />
Mrs. Walker…?<br />
<br />
It echoed in her ears.<br />
<br />
She should&#39;ve laughed. She should’ve screamed. But instead…<br />
<br />
“…Okay,” she whispered, dazed.<br />
<br />
Hand in hand, the two new couples walked down the “aisle,” flower petals continuing to fall from nowhere. They stepped into the food court, which had somehow been transformed into a grand reception space, complete with wedding cake, slow music, and a photo booth labeled &quot;Just Married!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess’s dress sparkled under the soft lights, a white satin thing that hugged her waist, complete with a flowing veil she didn’t remember putting on. Ryan led her to a dance floor, where he pulled her close, one hand resting on her lower back.<br />
<br />
They danced slowly.<br />
<br />
Jess didn’t speak. She let herself be led, moving to the music as if her body knew what to do better than she did.<br />
<br />
“You’re really beautiful,” Ryan said.<br />
<br />
She blushed again. Deeply. Why was she blushing?<br />
<br />
“I… I feel weird,” Jess murmured.<br />
<br />
“Good weird or bad weird?” Ryan asked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Jess opened her mouth—then hesitated.<br />
“…I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
From a distance, Macy and Billy were already laughing, feeding each other cake, Macy’s eyes sparkling as she giggled like a real bride.<br />
<br />
Jess looked down at the gold ring on her hand.<br />
<br />
This isn’t right… I’m not a wife. I’m not even supposed to be a girl. I was—<br />
<br />
Her thoughts paused.<br />
<br />
I was… who was I again?<br />
<br />
She looked back at Ryan. His eyes were warm. Familiar. Safe.<br />
<br />
Her chest ached in the weirdest way, like she wanted to believe it. Maybe she already did.<br />
<br />
“…Do you want some cake?” he asked, brushing hair from her cheek.<br />
<br />
Jess blinked.<br />
“…Yeah. I’d like that.”</p>
