<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff, trying to come up with some excuse, found all he could think was, &quot;Avoid line of sight,&quot; as the coach again said, &quot;I would not have believed such a thing was possible,&quot; a second time. Wanting to play it cool and ask her, Jeff immediately realised that such an inquiry would not fly as Coach Gillian tightened her grip, spun him around and said, &quot;It&#39;s Jeff Kaylon, right? I think you&#39;d better come with me. And bring that thing with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to go anywhere with the woman, Jeff fumbled for an excuse, but was cut off when the coach told him, &quot;Be quiet,&quot; then mumbled, &quot;I&#39;ve seen some people do weird stuff, but never this,&quot; as she reached for the remote.<br />
<br />
The idea of losing the transmitter frightening him even more than the prospect that he&#39;d been caught, Jeff tried to say, &quot;It&#39;s just a...&quot; but trailed off when Coach Gillian gave him a withering look. Trying to think of something he could say, Jeff found himself suddenly drawn back the way he&#39;d come and before he knew it, he was forced to take a seat in Coach Gillian&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look. I&#39;m sorry for whatever. It was. Nothing came of it. Everything should be okay,&quot; Jeff began to babble as the coach sat down on the other side of her desk and watching as she picked up the consent form, clearly seeing Jessica Kaylon written on it, he stopped as he wondered how it could still exist. Pointing to it, he started to say one thing, then switched to explaining, &quot;That&#39;s a forgery. It has nothing to do with me,&quot; and promptly recoiled backward when the coach told him, &quot;Be quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
A angry look crossing her face, Coach Gillian leaned forward and explained, &quot;I&#39;ve dealt with your kind before. The one&#39;s who, for whatever reason, think cheerleading and girl&#39;s sports are a joke. To be mocked. To be pranked. Whatever. But never have I seen such elaborate terms, such lengths, gone to just to do what you did,&quot; and dropping the form, she went on with, &quot;I&#39;ve caught boys like you peeping. Cross-dressing just to sneak in the locker room. Cross-dressing to have some fun as it were. But you. What you did goes beyond those levels of depravity. I have memories of a girl I am sure doesn&#39;t exist come to this school today for the first time. Proof that she showed up today, tried out for the cheerleading squad. Was one of the best I&#39;ve seen in years. Yet. Looking at you. Thinking about what I saw in that seldom, if at all, used back hall. I find myself doubting. And so, I question myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what to say, Jeff sat numbly as Coach Gillian took a deep breath and asked, &quot;How did you do it? I am sure it wasn&#39;t the usual half-baked ideas that others have come up. No. I saw you naked. The other girls saw you naked. What I saw, it was too realistic. Yet. Here you sit before me. Clearly a boy I recognise as having graduated just this year. So, how did you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to tell her anything, but seeing the dangerous look on the coach&#39;s face, Jeff considered for a moment to simply refuse to say anything. But, seeing no other option, he slowly began explaining how the remote worked, the programme it ran and how it had turned him into a sixteen-year-old girl. When he finished, he sat numbly in silence, thinking. After a moment, he quietly said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Nobody was supposed to know. It was only meant to be a bit of fun, that&#39;s all. When I changed back, everything should have reverted back to the way it was supposed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if knowing the last part of what he said was a lie, Coach Gillian hissed, &quot;But it didn&#39;t. For whatever reason, I remember a girl named Jessica Kaylon. I have her consent form right here, signed by her aunt carol. And, to top it all off, I am now short one girl. A girl, as I said before, who was one of the best I&#39;ve seen in years. So, the question now, is what should I do? With you and with the dilemma I face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scared, knowing he was in deep trouble, Jeff searched for an answer. As if reading his mind, Coach Gillian told him, &quot;I do have one readily available option. One I have employed in the past. I can call the cops and turn you over to them. Of course, you won&#39;t be treated as a minor offender, like the others I have used this option in the past on. No. You will be treated as an adult. A sexual deviant and a blight on society, with definite jail time. On top of that, I&#39;ll have to alert your mother to what you did, which I am sure will cause her no end of shame. Of course, I&#39;ll have to omit a few of the less believable details,&quot; and reaching for the phone on her desk, she paused and gazed steely at him.<br />
<br />
The fear he was experiencing deepening, especially at the prospect that he was likely to go through like branded as something he didn&#39;t believe he was, Jeff waited to see what she would do. Swear starting to bead his brow, he shifted uncomfortable and after a moment, when nothing happened, he suddenly wailed out, &quot;Please, don&#39;t. Look, I am sorry for what I did. I&#39;m sure there is something I could do to correct this situation. Maybe I could recommend girls? Or some sort of extra work around the school. Anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile playing across her face, Coach Gillian slowly drew her hand away from the phone. Peering at Jeff, smiling sweetly, she eventually replied, &quot;Well, I am sure there is something you could do,&quot; and pausing, she watched him for a moment, thinking he was almost like a worm on the end of some fishing hook. After a minute or so, she explained, &quot;There is one thing you could do. And that is become Jessica,&quot; and holding up a hand to stop him from saying anything, she told him, &quot;And I don&#39;t mean on a part-time basis. I mean that you will become Jessica for the next four years. You will eat, sleep and breath the life of a teenage girl, learning and growing as she does. You will do everything she is supposed to do, be it cheerleading or dating boys,&quot; and seeing the look on his face, she emphasised, &quot;Yes, Mr Kaylon. Dating boys. I do mean everything. All the things a teenage girl has to deal with. The good. And the bad. It&#39;s either this. Or, I start making phone calls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unhappy with his choices, Jeff pleaded, &quot;You can&#39;t make me do this. I cannot be Jessica. For starters, I don&#39;t have any of the knowledge of being a girl. I only created the template with a background in gymnastics, ballet and cheerleading. She&#39;s really just a girl with the mind of a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; Coach Gillian thought for a moment. &quot;I have a perminant solution to our little problem.  I can&#39;t let a womanizing pervert like you go, so somthing has to change for good.  You can remain Jeff... but you&#39;ll revert to 16 and be a gay man on a unisex cheerleading squad.  You&#39;ll be their leader, their inspiration, and you&#39;ll be their best friend, participating in all the girl stuff - because you&#39;ll be like one of the girls, talking about boyfriend problems and such... becuase you won&#39;t have any interest in girls again.&quot;<br />
<br />
A feeling of wanting to cry, to beg, to try and convince the coach to come up with something else settling over him, Jeff peered at the her, hoping she would see all this. But, seeing she wasn&#39;t buying it and that his only choice was to become a gay cheerleader version of himself and relive high school for the next four years... or go to jail.  He swallowed, a lump in his throat nearly choking him as he did so. Thinking that he&#39;d been stupid, he reached for the transmitter that Coach Gillian had set on her desk and numbly waking it up, he turned it so the antenna was pointing at him and hit the enter key.<br />
<br />
Again, he felt the same pain and discomfort - but this time in his head.  He grabbed it in his hands, as his mental furniture was rearranged, changing him perminantly from heterosexual Jeff - who loved girls - to gay Jeff, who had a thing for boys and dreamed of bottoming for them when he wasn&#39;t busy with schoolwork, cheerleading, or hanging with the girls.  Images flashed through is mind, his memories changing... girls he fancied became boys he fancied, his fantasies of breasts and vaginas were replaced with muscles and cocks. Wondering if he was getting used to the transformation, he found himself amazed when it had finished quicker than he thought it would take - a lifetime of memories and thoughts transformed. Looking down at his clothing, it was definitely more colorful and stylish than what he wore before, but at least it was a guy&#39;s clothing.  There were still differences, like the feeling of the soft fabric touching his now soft skin (he had a hydrating regiment for his skin and hair, he had to stay healthy after all), and realising that he didn&#39;t have underwear on, Jeff was vaguely aware of the backpack with a pink triangle on it and man-purse that appeared next to him.  Also, his hair was longer now, he wore it up in a man-bun.<br />
<br />
Coach Gillian, in awe at what just happened before her, still trying to come to terms that this was the second time she&#39;d seen such a thing occur, reached across her desk to pick up the transmitter. It wasn&#39;t as dramatic as last time, but in its own way it was still dramatic - a straight male replaced with a younger, clearly gay male now sitting before her. Noting that the screen had gone dark, she considered waking it up, but instead opened up one of the lower drawers on her desk and hid the remote inside. Locking the drawer, she turned back to the boi sitting on the other side of her desk. Seeing his happy grin and sparkly eyes, Coach Gillian smiled in a pleasant manner, knowing this gay boy would only be hitting on other boys from now on and would never bother another girl, and said, &quot;You look at peace. Being gay won&#39;t be too bad, it looks good on you. Before you know it, the four years will pass in a flash. Now. I&#39;m sure your aunt will want to hear the good news,&quot; and dismissing her with the words, &quot;See you on the twenty third,&quot; she watched as eighteen-year-old Jeff, now sixteen-year-old Jeffery, stood and, before he left, collected his man purse and backpack,  she - Coach Gillian - wasn&#39;t sure were they&#39;d come from, but was certain Jeff hadn&#39;t had them before.<br />
<br />
Conflicted, her memories telling her two different things, she waited until the gay boy had left before leaning back in her chair. Staring up at the ceiling, thinking, &quot;Chronivac,&quot; over and over, she eventually stood and left her office. Making sure the door was locked, she headed for the main office, where she found information that stated a boy, Jeffery Kaylon, had recently moved to town with his aunt and would be starting eleventh grade in the fall.</p>
