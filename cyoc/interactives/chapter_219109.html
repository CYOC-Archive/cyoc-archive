<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After giving it some thought, “Milo” grins, “I think I’ll fix his way of thinking,” he says to himself, “I’ll make him think more like an animal. An animal should have the mind of an animal, and humans, as I said ARE animals, even master admitted that”. So “Milo” opens the boy’s file, “when I have fixed master, I’ll fix master Bryan, then my old masters! Hmm… come to think of it,” he mumbles, an idea popping into his head, he then smiles, “why not fix every single human on this planet?”<br />
<br />
Jeff, who still thinks he is the pet dog of the family who has been transformed into a “clone” of the family’s neighbor “Jeff”, thanks to Ethan’s programming, opens a tab that is labelled “mass transformation”. He then scrolls through the options until he finds a file labeled “inhabitants of planet Earth”, he opens the file and edits the mentality of every single human on the planet from “human”, which he “Milo” is convinced is some sort of mistake, to “animal”, with a happy smile, he confirms the change, “there… that should do it. Wait… maybe I should also change the instincts to animal? Yeah… that sounds good… and… done,” he says to himself, “wagging” his butt from side to side, “maybe I’ll fix something else later, maybe the way humans walk, or I could give them fur, a tail, or make them look more like animals, like they should be”.<br />
<br />
Bryan, who had been waiting for Ethan and Jeff to finally come and play some soccer with him, lets out a sigh, starting to feel disappointed, “typical… I hate it when people don’t keep their promises,” the boy then turns and starts to head back inside. As he walks, he suddenly feels weird, he grimaces as he starts to scratch himself, “man these things… what ever they are, feel so uncomfortable,” he whines and wastes no time to strip out of the clothes. Bryan just lets the clothes fall to the ground and scowls down at them, already feeling a lot better without the stupid things clinging to his body, “why was I wearing those things anyway,” he asks himself. The boy lets out a snort and then enters the house, he spots Jeff sitting on the couch, also naked, thanks to “Milo’s” programming, Bryan does not find it awkward to see a older human naked, after all: it’s normal for humans to be naked. Bryan simply smiles as he walks up to “Milo”, “hey Jeff,” he says, “whatcha doing?”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Milo” looks up, at first he is confused why his young master his calling him “Jeff”, he then assumes that his other young master hasn’t told Bryan what he had done. “Master Bryan,” he then says, “it’s me “Milo”, your pet puppy. Master Ethan transformed me into a clone of “Jeff”,” he explains.<br />
<br />
Bryan tilts his head, looking confused, “we don’t…,” he starts, then his eyes widen, “oh… I see,” he says, assuming that Jeff and his brother are just pulling his leg. The boy mentally shrugs, ‘I’ll just play along,’ he thinks to himself, he then smiles, “so watcha up to… Milo,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, just sitting around,” “Milo” says, “dunno what else to do”.<br />
<br />
Bryan sits down next to “Milo”, “at least, let me give you some company,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Milo” smiles back, “that’ll be nice,” he says, “I did feel kinda bored and lonely, sitting here by myself”. When “Milo” looks at the naked 6 year-old, he starts to feel a little weird, he looks down at his penis and his eyes widen, ‘my cock… it’s growing,’ he thinks to himself. He looks back at Bryan, ‘master Bryan does feel submissive, and he is so young,’ he thinks to himself, ‘being the older animal here, makes me the alpha, I should show him who’s boss’. “Milo” grins, “master Bryan, I know what we can do,” he says.<br />
<br />
Bryan looks over at Jeff/”Milo”, “what have you in mind Je… I mean “Milo”?”<br />
<br />
“Milo” does not say a word, he just smiles and points to his 5.5 inch erect cock, ‘if fixing the human’s instincts really worked, he should know what to do, especially if he is as submissive as I feel he is,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Bryan looks down at Jeff’s/”Milo’s” cock, a strange feeling washes over the boy, ‘I feel weird… a part of me finds it disgusting but a other part tells me Jeff… I mean Milo… is above me. That he is the alpha and I am just a little puppy,’ the 6 year old thinks to himself, ‘I should listen to my instincts. If my place is beneath Milo, then that is how its supposed to be’.<br />
<br />
“Milo” grins when he watches Bryan lean forward, the boy’s face inching closer and closer to his big throbbing cock, “that’s it, pup,” “Milo” says, grinning, “hehe… I need to thank Ethan for making me older. Being a puppy was boring, I had nothing to say, but now, being the older animal in this pack, that makes me the alpha”.<br />
<br />
“But isn’t my dad the alpha of the pack,” Bryan asks, looking up at “Milo”, “he is the oldest”.<br />
<br />
“Milo” tilts his head, “good point,” he says, “I’ll need to deal with that, can’t have a competition, this pack is mine! YOU ARE MINE! Now, do what your instinct tell you to do! Show me that I am the rightful leader of the pack!”<br />
<br />
Bryan turns back to look at “Milo’s” cock, ‘he does smell like a leader,’ he says, sniffing at “Milo’s” cock, he then sticks out his tongue and starts to lick the cock.<br />
<br />
“Milo” bites his lower lip, letting out a moan, “good… boy,” he says, “yes… make it nice… and wet”.<br />
<br />
Bryan continues to lick eagerly at the cock, ‘at first… it tasted weird,’ he thinks to himself, ‘now… it tastes really good!’<br />
<br />
“Milo” grins down at the boy licking his cock, ‘what a good pup he is,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but… I need a female. I know! I’ll make master Ethan into my female, and after dealing with the “competition” I’ll also have mistress Michelle as a female. A true leader should have more than one female… hehe… first, I hated what has happened to me, but now… now I LOVE IT! Being a human isn’t that bad, I feel much smarter than before!’<br />
<br />
While Bryan continues to lick “Milo”, the “former dog” takes the his phone and opens the App, he then opens Ethan’s file and grins as he starts editing. First, he changes Ethan’s gender to female, then he sets the “female’s” fertility to high, which will cause “her” to go into heat, he leaves Ethan’s awareness off, not wanting his “female” to freak. Satisfied, he confirms the changes and turns his attention back to Bryan, “that’s enough,” he says, stopping Bryan from continuing to lick him.<br />
<br />
“Bu-but…,” Bryan starts, sounding disappointed and sad, he even lets out a whine.<br />
<br />
“Milo” grins, “don’t worry,” he says, “now comes the best part! Present,” he orders.<br />
<br />
At the word “present” Bryan feels something click in his mind, the 6 year old immediately gets off the couch, he then walks in front of “Milo”, turns around and gets down on his hands and knees, showing “Milo” his butt.<br />
<br />
Grinning “Milo” stands up and soon is kneeling behind Bryan, “this might feel weird at first, but you’ll enjoy it,” he says. “Milo” then spreads the boy’s butt cheeks and leans his head forward, he then starts to lick Bryan’s hole, even sticking his tongue inside and moving it around, causing the young boy to let out a surprised gasp, which quickly turns into moans.<br />
<br />
“M-Milo…,” Bryan says, “f-feels so g-good,” the boy pushes his butt back, trying to get “Milo’s” tongue in deeper.<br />
<br />
“Milo” grins as he continues to lick the boy’s ass, ‘he tastes so young,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
After a while, “Milo” stops licking the boy, causing Bryan to let out a disappointing sounding whimper. “Milo” chuckles, “hehe… don’t worry, pup,” he says, patting the boy’s head, “the real fun is about to start. Now, this might at first feel uncomfortable and a little painful, but you’ll enjoy it soon enough,” he says. “Milo” lines his cock up to Bryan’s hole and starts to push forward, he hears the boy groan and feels the boy clench his butt together, “try to relax,” “Milo” says, “it’ll be less painful. Try taking in deep breaths… that’s it… aaaaand… there we go! Wow… you are t-tight… f-feels so good around my cock!”<br />
<br />
When the head of “Milo’s” cock pops into Bryan, the boy let’s out a sharp gasp as he feels his bum being painfully stretched, tears form in his eyes, but his new instinct tell him to stay putt… that this is right… that “Milo” is the alpha and he, Bryan, has to allow the older animal to dominate him.<br />
<br />
“Milo” continues to push his cock into the boy, letting out groans and moans of pleasure, when he is halfway in, “Milo” starts to thrust, causing Bryan to whimper in pain, “hush, pup,” “Milo” says, “y-you’ll soon en-enjoy it,” he says, with each thrust, “Milo” manages to enter his cock deeper into the boy.<br />
<br />
After a while, Bryan starts to feel the pain subside and become replaced by pleasure, the boy starts to moan and even push his butt back, trying to get “Milo’s” cock deeper into him.<br />
<br />
“Milo” grins, “good… boy,” he says, “you… you are doing great! Te-Tell me: who is y-your alpha and… leader of the p-pack?”<br />
<br />
“Y-you are… M-Milo,” Bryan moans, “on-only you!”<br />
<br />
“Milo” grins, “that’s right,” he says, starting to thrust harder and faster into the boy, “don’t you… EVER… forget that!”<br />
<br />
While “Milo” continues to “put” Bryan in his place, upstairs in Ethan’s room, the 12 year old, who has discarded his clothes and is now laying naked in his bed, suddenly feels his body become warmer and warmer. Ethan starts to groan, as he twists and turns in discomfort, ‘wh-why do I feel so hot all of a sudden,’ he asks himself, ‘my… my body feels as if it’s on fire’. The boy does not notice as his hair lengthens, his face and body take on a much more feminine appearance and his cock twitches as it, along with Ethan’s balls, start to shrink back into his body. Ethan’s tummy grumbles as a womb forms, pushing his insides out of the way as his hips widen and his bum becoming rounder, bigger and firmer. The boy’s… now girl’s… chest puffs out into two small B-Cups, soon a girl is lying on the bed, panting, ‘n-need… my mate,’ is all she can think of, ‘must.. find M-Milo,’ Ethan quickly jumps from the bed and hurries downstairs, to find “Milo” still thrusting in and out of her little brother. “M-Milo… I… I need you,” the new girl cries, getting down onto her hands and knees, starting to crawl towards the pair.<br />
<br />
Seeing Ethan enter, “Milo” can’t help but grin, “I know,” he says, “let me finish… showing Bryan here… his place. Then I’ll happily take care of you, Ethan! Hmmm… can’t really call you “Ethan” anymore… how about “bitch”? It’s simple, easy to remember and besides: that is what you are and always will be: MY bitch!”<br />
<br />
Ethan lets out a whimper, “pl-please M-Milo,” she says, “pl-please… I feel so desperate! I’ll be your bitch… I’ll happily take it as my name! Just PLEASE! Please f-fuck me already!”<br />
<br />
“Milo” laughs, “patience my, bitch,” he says, “I’ll be done soon and then we’ll have some fun!”</p>
