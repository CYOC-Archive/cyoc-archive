<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He'd only gotten as far as the kitchen, holding the clothes and plush mouse balled up together and under one arm, before Carla, who was raiding the fridge, snapped at him, &quot;You know mom doesn't like you walking around in nothing but your swimsuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you mind your own business,&quot; Denny retorted as Carla's friend walked, most likely drawn by the promise of the ensuing argument.<br />
<br />
Slamming the fridge, Carla snarled, &quot;I'm telling mom you won't listen me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why should I listen to a bossy snob like you,&quot; Denny replied as he shifted what he was holding, which had started to slip.<br />
<br />
Before Carla could say anything they heard a door close near the front of the house. Knowing their mother was home, Carla snapped, &quot;You are in so much trouble,&quot; and turning, she started to leave the kitchen as her friend glared at Denny with a know-it-all look upon her face.<br />
<br />
Following his sister, forgetting for the moment what he was wearing, Denny listened as Carla began to holler at their mother about what Denny was doing. Chiming in his own voice, Denny listened as their mother immediately announced, &quot;Girls! Enough!&quot; and turning her attention to Carla, she explained, &quot;Let me deal with your sister,&quot; and glancing at Denny she said, &quot;You know you shouldn't be wandering around in nothing but your swimsuit. This isn't a beach. Walking around wearing like that is like walking around in your underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what to say, Denny squirmed about, shifting the balled up clothes and plush mouse. Finally, thinking quickly, he said the first thing that came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;But! I was playing outside. In the sprinkler. And I only just came in,&quot; Denny whined, unaware that he was doing so.<br />
<br />
Next to him Carla made a face and was about to say something when their mother cut in and said, &quot;I don't want to hear it,&quot; and just as both were about to say something, their mother cut them off again and said, &quot;From either of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making another face, Carla turned and stormed off to her room, her friend following. Wanting only to get out of the swimsuit, Denny shifted the items he was holding and was just about to turn and head for his room when his mother stopped him by announcing, &quot;Not so fast young lady. I have some clothes I just bought you and I need you to try them on,&quot; and before Denny could say or do anything, his mother took him by the hand and began to lead him toward his room, stopping long enough to pick up several bags by the front door that Denny had failed to notice.<br />
<br />
When they got to his room, his mother dropped the bags on his bed and as she headed for Denny’s dresser, she told him, “Strip.”<br />
<br />
Hesitant and unsure of wanting to get naked in front of his mother, his mind reminding him that he was still clearly a fourteen year old boy even though Carla, their mother and Carla’s friend were treating him like a girl. Noticing Denny’s hesitation, his mother said, “It’s not like I haven’t seen you naked before,” as she took something that Denny couldn’t quite see out of the top dresser drawer.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, sure that his mother at least was acting like this because she wanted to teach Denny a lesson about wearing age and gender appropriate clothes, Denny began to take off the swimsuit, starting with the top part. When he began taking off the bottom piece, he tried hard to keep his penis and testicles, which he knew he still had, betwixt his legs. But when they slipped forward, he paused, curious as to what his mother would do before stepping out of the bikini.<br />
<br />
When she handed a pair of what was clearly a pair of girl’s underwear, Denny found himself torn between several conflicting emotions. As he pulled on the underwear, he was elated that everyone was treating him like a girl because he himself was sure he was supposed to be a girl. But at the same time he felt that soon the other boot would come down and this would turn out to be some life lesson his mother was trying to teach him. While, at the same time, he felt confused because he wasn’t sure how and if it was possible for a person could go from being a fourteen year old boy to clearly a girl younger than ten without actually being born a girl or taking pills and having surgery.<br />
<br />
“Which wouldn’t account for the loss of age,” he thought to himself as he pulled the underwear up, only mildly upset that it dipped low in front.<br />
<br />
After he’d pulled on the undergarment, Denny wondered where they had come from as they were clearly not the pair that he gotten with the romper. But before he could really give it any thought, his mother had started going through the bags, commenting, “We need to make sure that these second-hand items fit you,” as she did this.<br />
<br />
When his mother started handing him shirts, Denny took them without saying a word, sure that they wouldn’t fit, but at the same time leery that they would when he remembered that Carla’s shorts and tank top had fit, as well as the Hello Kitty two-piece swimsuit. After his mother had finished with the shirts, which were all rather long in the sleeves and kind of baggy in the main section that covered the torso, she began to hand him dresses and skirts, telling him, “I got your tights and underwear new, so they should fit you for a while,” as she handed him the various articles of clothing.<br />
<br />
As his mother had him try on one dress or skirt after another, at which she either start tugging at the bodice or the skirt of the dress, adjusting it, or just tugging at the skirts so that they came down to a decent length, making various comments as she did so, Denny merely stood there, taking it all in stride.  As this went on, Denny let his thoughts wander. After a moment, he came to the conclusion that this was something he liked and could get used to, being treated like a girl, he just couldn’t understand why he didn’t look like a girl.<br />
<br />
“Or my room,” he thought to himself as he gazed quickly about, noting that his room still looked like it was appropriate for a fourteen year old boy.<br />
<br />
And than it came to his attention that the clothes he’d left on his bed had disappeared. Before he could dwell on what had happened to them, his mother had him take off the dress and she began having him try on pants.<br />
<br />
After she was done having Denny try on the clothes, his mother muttered that all would fit and that what they needed was to be washed. Thinking that they were done, Denny thought that now he could go back to wearing boy’s clothing, except for the underwear, which he found he actually enjoyed wearing. To his surprise, his mother began to go through his dresser and taking from within, she handed him a short-sleeve pink shirt with long white sleeves coming out where the pink sleeves ended, a denim skirt and a pair of purple tights with pink hearts on them.<br />
<br />
As his mother told him, “Get dressed, please,” Denny had to wonder how it was his dresser had been rearranged so that it apparently had only girl’s clothes.<br />
<br />
“If that is in fact what it has,” Denny thought as he sat down and pulled on the tights.<br />
<br />
The moment his mother had left, he could hear her still in the hall telling Carla to put on something nice, Denny stood and headed for his dresser. Opening the drawers one at a time, finding that all his usual boy clothes had been replaced by clothes suitable for a young girl.<br />
<br />
Heading for his closet, Denny found it to be full of dresses. Sitting back down on his bed, pulling on the shirt his mother had handed him, noting that the heart pattern didn’t go all the way up, Denny wondered how he gotten to this point. “It’s almost as if my life has taken a feminine turn,” he thought as reached for the denim skirt and standing, started to pull it on, noting that the zipper was on the side and would be hidden once it was zipped.</p>
