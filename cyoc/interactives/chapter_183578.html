<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy led the others down an aisle of candies. Lina skimmed the labels as they passed, then told the others to stop. &quot;I think something in here can help.&quot; The three college girls searched for a candy that sounded like it would change Lina into a Monkey Girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chihuahua Chews, Candy Cows, Gummy Grasshoppers...&quot; Samantha read aloud in amazement, as she followed behind the other two, still trying to believe this store was for real.<br />
<br />
Amy clopped over to Lina on her solid hooves. &quot;Neeighh! I found it!&quot; She gave Amy a box with gummy bananas on the front. It was labeled &quot;Going Bananas: Candy that takes you back to your wild origins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This looks as good as anything,&quot; Lina smiled. The banana smell was already noticeable before she even opened the box. She pried open the flap and dumped several small banana-shaped gummies into her hand. Sam and Amy watched her intently, as if she was about to eat a handful of live worms. Lina chuckled nervously at their stares and popped the candies into her mouth.<br />
<br />
They tasted like richly flavored fruit chews. Nothing very different. She swallowed them and ate a few more. As she chewed, her lips began to tingle. The odd feeling spread over her entire face and around her head. Lina felt like someone was gently massaging her ears, and the sounds of the shop seemed to shift slightly. She saw her friends looking at her wide-eyed. &quot;Wush happenin?&quot; she asked with the bananas still in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your face is changing,&quot; said Samantha incredulously. With a shaking hand she reached up and tucked her unruly hair back behind her ear for the umpteenth time. &quot;Just like a monkey&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hair is changing too!&quot; Amy added. She looked up and down the aisle. &quot;Come on let&#39;s find you a mirror, hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy pulled Lina by the arm down the aisle. Lina didn&#39;t know where they were headed, but she went along anyway. <br />
<br />
She threw a few more candies into her mouth as she felt her scalp itch like crazy. <br />
<br />
Soon her arms were feeling weird too, and she saw some light muscle tone emerging in her forearms and biceps, as blonde hair brushed its way across them, thickening her natural body hair slightly. <br />
<br />
Her feet were feeling more and more cramped every step she took, and finally put her hand on Amy&#39;s shoulder to get her to stop walking. Lina pulled off her white sneakers and nearly choked on the candy as her eyes beheld the hands encased in her white socks. <br />
<br />
Well not quite yet. She thought as she peeled the socks off. But they look much more like hands than they did before at least.<br />
<br />
They were bigger than normal human feet, and a fair bit hairier, but they were definitely not fully human anymore. She wiggled her longer toes...soon to be fingers...and they responded with more range of movement than normal toes would. Her big toe felt weird though, uncomfortably tight, as though it didn&#39;t like where it was next to the other toes.<br />
<br />
She absentmindedly popped another banana candy in her mouthed and chewed, watching her feet intently. Tingling filled her feet as she watched her big toe pop and crack, it shifted along with the general shape of her foot, growing longer as it slid down the side of her arch. <br />
<br />
I&#39;ve got thumbs on my feet, she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Her four other toes quickly popped and cracked too, lengthening and warping until her feet moved more like a normal hand would. Her thumbs were dexterous, and she tried griping one hairier ankle with the other hand/foot. It was a little hard to maneuver at first, but she managed to grip it fine. Soon she was twiddling her new fingers as if she had been using the hands her entire life.<br />
<br />
She popped a few more candy bananas into her mouth and felt her clothing itch. She guessed her hair was thickening all over her body now. A sudden pain in her pants alerted her to what must be a tail. She told Amy and Sam to look away, and she pulled her pants down to free it from the tight garment. She watched it snake its way out of her body, foot by foot. It stopped at three feet, but she popped another few candies and watched it grow beyond four.<br />
<br />
Finally, she was satisfied with the changes. There were a few gummies left in the box, but she decided to stop until she had the chance to experience her new form. She shimmied her pants back on, pulling them up as much as she could with her tail in the way. &quot;Ooo-oo...Um, Amy?&quot; she asked through thick teeth. She was surprised to be making chimp-like sounds. &quot;Cooo-oooh...could you...?&quot; she turned to indicate her tail while holding the front of her pants up at the waist.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s eyes twinkled to show that she understood. She placed her strong hoof-hands along the back of Lina&#39;s pants. Carefully, she used her strength and tore open a hole in Lina&#39;s pants large enough for her monkey tail. Once it was done, she helped Lina guide the tail through. With her pants back on, Amy once again grabbed Lina&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;This way!&quot; she whinnied. They passed many more aisles until Lina saw a row of mirrors up ahead. They were in the fashion aisle now. At the floor-length mirror they stopped and Lina beheld her new body.<br />
<br />
Her normal hair was gone, replaced with a long mane of straight blonde hair that was far thicker and wilder than before. Her cheeks also had some fur on them, and her ears were huge. Her nose was pulled into her face more, revealing two prominent nostrils. Her eyes were a tad larger, and her jaw was very pronounced, like a chimp&#39;s. The majority of her body was free of fur, but patches of blonde fur dusted the backs of her hands and feet, as well as her shoulders. Below her underwear, she could tell her pubic hair was much more prevalent than before.<br />
<br />
Her hands were a little larger, and her arms were a few inches longer. Her long tail was waving behind her. She looked closely, and realized that her clothes were a little baggier than before. She must have shrunk at least six inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is great!&quot; she said. I even feel moo-oo-oore energetic! Like I cooo-ooould hang from the rafters of this musty old place!&quot; She did a few cartwheels down the aisle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neeiighh! Glad you like it,&quot; Amy said. &quot;Now what&#39;s next?&quot; She gave a playful glance at Sam, who looked amazed at Lina&#39;s incredible change.</p>
