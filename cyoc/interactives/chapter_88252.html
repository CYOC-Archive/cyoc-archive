<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">May sat there in the grass in puzzlement over everything that had happened. The night was supposed to be a normal family get-together with her husband and her children, along with her in-laws. The highlight of the get-together was to be the eclipse of the moon which now hung over them. From there, things got weird. Her husband and sons turned into werewolves under it and in his pain, James had accidentally clawed her and now she was transforming. She felt hot and itchy as blonde fur began to grow out all over her body. On her arms she could clearly see it, but under her clothing it was much more easily felt as her growing fur rubbed against her clothing, making the area itch even more. It was all strange and surprising and even scary to a degree, even if her husband and sons hadn&#39;t turned into mindless beasts, and a good part of her was shocked at how lightly her husband&#39;s brother was treating the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget the steaks!&quot; May declared, &quot;what... what... ab...out... mmeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaAAARRRRGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
The end of her demand ended there as a massive wave of pain hit her like a tone of bricks. Her fingers and toes were throbbing heavily and her body felt like it was on fire. She wanted to say she was afraid, but all she could manage was pained screams.<br />
<br />
&quot;It huuurrrrrrrrrts!&quot; May declared after a moment before clamping her jaws shut for a moment and then rapidly opening again, feeling pain on her jaw. In trepidation, she ran her tongue along her teeth and she soon found what she feared. All of her teeth were sharper now, but her canines were beginning to lengthen into fangs, great big killing teeth of a predator. She only screamed again and brought her hands up to her face, even as claws sprouted from her finger tips and began to become more paw-like than hand like, just has her husband&#39;s hands had. In a way she still had hands, but they weren&#39;t going to be quite as dexterous as she had been as a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get her inside,&quot; Nate said to his brother, as he watched May&#39;s nose reshape into a black triangle and her face begin to push slightly forward to accommodate her changing teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will that stop her from changing? Will that let her change back?&quot; James asked as he watched May&#39;s ears stretch and twist until they were triangular wolf ears covered in blonde fur and sticking up on the top of her head. His tone was nervous and afraid, not afraid of what she could become, as something in him told him that werewolves weren&#39;t mindless monsters. Predators maybe, but not monsters. His fear was more on what May would think of him, as he was the reason she was presently in such pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Nate said slowly, and bit back a whimper as he saw tears come to Mays eyes as they began to shift from a bright blue  to more of an amberish color, &quot;we can&#39;t turn her back... but inside, any noise she makes in her first transformation will be muffled and won&#39;t attract much attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He... he... hel... help... me,&quot; May whimpered as she felt her body begin to grow in size and as her feet began to grow cramped her shoes. Everything hurt or itched and she wanted it to end.<br />
<br />
James and Nate both came to her and offered her their hands. She took Jame&#39;s hands and mentally cringed as she felt the pads underneath her own fingers touch the fur on the back of his hand. Part of it was a lack of sensation, or at least a partial lack of sensation. The pads were tough and relatively hard, just like a dog&#39;s would be, just like a wolf&#39;s would be. She could still feel, but her sense of touch through her pads wasn&#39;t as good as human hands had been. Even with that though, she could feel that James&#39;s fur was rather rough, almost coarse to the touch. She knew the fur that she&#39;d grown probably felt the same. Even with it, both James and Nate held her up, hoisting her up onto their shoulders. For the moment it had her completely off the ground, and she began kicking her legs, mostly to try and get her tightening shoes off.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, May,&quot; James said to her, &quot;It&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
May then blinked at what she felt next. It was James&#39; tongue. He had licked her as he and Nate carried her into the house. She looked over to him and despite the inhumanness of his eyes, she could still see the caring and even protective man she married. She didn&#39;t know how she could, but she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, May,&quot; James said to her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I clawed you...&quot;<br />
<br />
They took her into one back living room and carefully set her down. May wanted to thank them, but the pain was still great and was now being made worse that as her muscles enlarged along with the rest of her body, her clothing began to grow tight. The worst of it was presently her shoes as the material just wasn&#39;t going to give, despite the pressure her lengthening feet put on them. Nate and James set her down on the carpet as Hunter and Mickey followed them, looking nervously at their mother. May half wondered if she was frightening them in the same sort of way she had been frightened when she watched James transform. She only whimpered as she felt her growing toe claws begin to dig into the soles of her shoes from the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be okay, May, James is here, your sons are here,&quot; Nate assured her, &quot;Your family is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
May only whimpered in response, though she felt some relief as Nate and James managed to pull her shoes off before her growing digitigrade feet burst through them. She didn&#39;t know if her shoes would still work when she was human again, if she could be human again, but for the immediate moment, she had greater concerns, and that was her tightening clothing and a changing sensation in the transformation. The seems of her clothing was beginning to rip and pinch in many of the places that made it almost painful for her. At the same time, she could feel her hips beginning to widen further, to accommodate her strengthening legs. However, her muscles weren&#39;t the only things growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooouuurrrrrhhm?&quot; May barked in surprise as began to feel her bra begin to constrict on her. Her breasts were growing in size, and that combined with her growing frame, began to pop the buttons on her shirt and they began to expose her bra and the blonde furred breasts  it covered. Even with difficulties of her tightening clothing, May felt herself growing aroused as her breasts grew larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Hunter asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;May?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get her clothes off,&quot; Nate urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; James began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother... we are both too big for our own clothes, Jeanie in her wolf form is too big for her clothes,&quot; Nate sighed, &quot;either we remove her clothing, or she&#39;s going to grow through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
May didn&#39;t give then the time to debate the issue. She didn&#39;t normally condone nudity, but her clothes were growing too tight for her own comfort and as she struggled to get her clothes off, she got onto her new feet and crouched down while bent forward to allow her to reach above her back and pull at her shirt. She heard a bit of a ripping noise as she pulled her shirt off and gave a short whine as she then stood up, holding what her transforming body had essentially turned to rags. As she stood up, her bra, now digging deeply into her flesh snapped under the pressure her growing bosom was placed on it. Her breasts bounced slightly as they came free and she actually felt herself growing wet as a result. She wanted to resist, but found that she couldn&#39;t as her transformation continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; James could only manage as May reached down and pulled her own tightening pants and underwear off of her, giving a triumphant growl in doing so. &quot;May...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... I feel... a... a... aarrk... aaark... aaaaarrrrrf,&quot; May tried to answer but soon began to bark as her face pushed forward into a wolf-like muzzle.<br />
<br />
Remembering the pain and how that felt when his own muzzle grew out, James came forward and hugged his wife, pulling her toward him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re almost there, May,&quot; James told her as he felt her arms wrap around him, &quot;You&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do... do you still think I&#39;m pretty?&quot; May looked up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The prettiest she-wolf I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; James smiled and then noticed a blonde nub beginning to push out from just above her backside. He heard a slight cracking noise in her spine and as her tail grew, May raised her head and howled, announcing the completion of her transformation. James soon joined her to show that he loved her still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Okay!&quot; Nate urged, &quot;Enough with the chorus! We don&#39;t want to alert your neighbors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, May?&quot; James asked to her as he pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just turned into a werewolf, I&#39;m naked in front of my brother-in-law AND my sons, and I have no real idea why...&quot; May gave a grumble, &quot;Other than that, I&#39;m just peachy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I shouldn&#39;t have clawed you,&quot; James told her.<br />
<br />
May sighed, &quot;You were in pain... I couldn&#39;t fault you for what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in time, that pain will go away,&quot; Nate spoke up, making four heads turn to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know, Uncle Nate?&quot; Mikey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t tonight your first transformation too?&quot; Hunter added.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, tonight wasn&#39;t my transformation,&quot; Nate answered and then looked to James, &quot;Or dad&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said he knows our ancestry?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded. He and his wife and his parents had come to be part of the family get-together, though mostly as a revelation of what their family was and what May had married into. But, they&#39;d never gotten the opportunity to warn James and his sons about what the eclipse would awaken in them. He felt a bit guilty at that, as James had been his older brother and had looked out for him when they had been growing up, and now when he got the chance to look out for his brother, he largely failed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate said slowly, &quot;Dad knows and found out... and I helped him... but this all occurred after you graduated college and were courting May... he found out and found a way to awaken it in us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you turned your wife?&quot; May asked.<br />
<br />
She watched and almost wondered if the black furred werewolf was actually blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;By accident yes... we... were having... uh... fun one night... I was in wolf form at the time, and she did love it... and in the throws of passion... I bit her by accident,&quot; Nate said slowly, &quot;but she did get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be quite a story,&quot; James commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, bro,&quot; Nate gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said these transformations won&#39;t hurt as much in the future?&quot; Mikey asked, &quot;Everything hurt and felt weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In time,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;it&#39;s one of those things you get used to... but we&#39;d best get the steaks cooked... everything will be fine... don&#39;t worry. Dad will explain things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What&#39;s that racket going on? Did it happen yet?&quot; came an older and slightly crotchety male voice from the general direction of Harris family dining room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it happened, dad,&quot; a female voice answered, &quot;you heard the howls... and it sounded like May joined the pack too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh boy,&quot; May said off hand.</p>
