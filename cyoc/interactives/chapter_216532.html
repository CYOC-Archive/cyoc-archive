<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The path to the Illusia Kennels dormitory for partially transformed participants was long and served as a sort of impromptu tour much of the Illusia Kennels division of the training facility. Part of it was an enclosed outdoor garden that looked like a children&#39;s playground with all sorts of toys and well-kept training equipment. Tony decided it was kind of nice to see the places where he would be spending his time over the next few weeks while he changed. Mrs. Bedlow was also very calming and professional, even if she was a little curt and not particularly talkative aside from pointing out significant locations.<br />
<br />
Tony occasionally nodded or gave simple replies to Mrs. Bedlow&#39;s brief informative comments but mostly just tried to keep up. Most of his attention was either on observing his surroundings or coming to terms with his current two changes. He was sometimes looking down at his clawed feet or lifting up his clawed hands to take another long look at those. Once in a while, he would experiment with making the end of his spine move and would grin slightly whenever it did what he wanted. It still felt weird to be able to do that, but his knotty little nub didn&#39;t feel quite as uncomfortable the more he exercised his new ownership over it. Even so, the fact that he would soon have his own actual tail like any canine was a lot for him to process, and it never seemed to stop being bizarre to see a full set of claws at the end of his human extremities. It sure was going to be one freaky week if the changes kept up at this pace!<br />
<br />
Mrs. Bedlow stopped at a tree near the edge of the training yard and looked back at Tony as if she were waiting for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asked, curious about what she could possibly be wanting him to say or do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well? Aren&#39;t you going to try it? We don&#39;t have all day here, you know,&quot; she prodded. He blinked a few times and finally got the gist of what she was hinting at. He gulped and looked down toward the base of the tree. He wondered if he should sniff it first, but he realized that he wasn&#39;t actually smelling things any different so far, at least not yet. He absolutely wasn&#39;t expected to actually &quot;leave his mark&quot; in a place like this yet, but then again, his junk was already hanging out, and it was always going to be, and this was something normal dogs did, and so...<br />
<br />
Tony waddled up face-to-bark with the tree, aimed his dick squarely at it, and released his yellow stream with a groan of relief. When it was over and the last droplets were dripping from the tip of his penis, he stepped back and strangely appreciated the scent of his urine wafting up from beneath him. That weird little tail nub of his started twitching left and right of its own accord, and he looked back up to see if Mrs. Bedlow was ready to continue the tour. She was, and she led him back inside to meet the young man who would be in charge of most of his training. The young man&#39;s name was David, and it turned out that he was 20 years old and went to the same elementary school Tony did for two years. It was yet another reminder for Tony that everyone else seemed to have found some sort of success before he did, and it only reminded Tony of the reasons for his decision to give up on his human life entirely to become a dog. Fortunately, David was friendly enough and seemed genuinely excited to meet Tony, not cocky or judgmental like Tony&#39;s party bros probably would have been.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Bedlow handed David the leash, and the two men walked together into little side building, where Tony was led to Room 4 which was where he&#39;d be staying. Tony found his first instinct was to sort of sniff the air a bit as he entered it, even though he didn&#39;t really notice anything in particular from doing so. Tony flopped down on the bed, swinging his arms and wagging his tail nub, almost making a sort of snow angel in the bed sheets and closing his eyes in comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long day, huh, boy?&quot; laughed David with a knowing smile, watching David enjoy the relaxing furniture. &quot;Go ahead and get a good nights sleep if it helps, cause I&#39;ll be back early to start our new schedule together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, even dogs have to get up early,&quot; Tony groaned in a half-hearted complaint to his new buddy. &quot;Oh, this bed is so worth it, though!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How I feel every night, man,&quot; chimed David. &quot;Might wanna watch those wicked new claws of yours, though. Don&#39;t wanna puncture your mattress on the first night, do ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony looked down at his left hand, and for the first time, actually smiled at his new weapons. They had a certain might, a certain ferocity, that he&#39;d never wielded before on such a part of his body. They weren&#39;t exactly on par knives or guns or grenades or anything like that, but they belonged to him now, and they would always be there, and they could easily cause problems for humans if he wanted them to, and more importantly, ONLY if he wanted them to. He now had a power humans lacked, and maybe, just maybe, he would eventually make a difference.<br />
<br />
Tony had already drifted off into a sound nap by the time that David quietly turned and closed the door.</p>
