<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We&#39;ll...we&#39;ll go awong wif whatevah you wanna do, Weth...&quot; Nick peeped, defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick!&quot; Clark squeaked, shocked at his surrender. Wes chuckled and booped both boys on their button noses as though they were being very silly indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you will. Because I&#39;m the adult and the two of you are, well, two.&quot; Wes grinned as he rubbed his chin and studied his young charges. &quot;Hm - if my nephews are anything to go by, we don&#39;t have nearly enough diapers to keep the two of you dry for the next few days. I think it&#39;s just about time for a supply run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t take us out-thide wike dis!&quot; Clark indignantly insisted. &quot;Can&#39;t you just get it dewivered?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And deny the outside world this one-two punch of utter cuteness?&quot; Wes snickered as he tickled their chubby tummies, drawing involuntary giggles from both boys. &quot;Not a chance. Now get those little hands up in the air so I can put some shirts on the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick and Clark reluctantly raised their pudgy arms and allowed Wes to dress them, neither boy feeling particularly covered in their tiny white t-shirts and matching virginal diapers. Both peeped at being simultaneously scooped up in Wes&#39; arms, at their crinkly bottoms being bounced on his strong, hairy arms with every step. The men turned toddlers studied their surroundings with equal parts dread and awe as the burly cop carried them out of the apartment and down the hall, both boys feeling even smaller now that they&#39;d been confronted with the giganticness of the outside world. Clark, having already suffered a stint in Pampers, managed to swallow the worst of his humiliation and fear. Nick had no such experience to draw on and as such found himself overwhelmed when carried him out into the light of day, the two-year-old feeling so little and so intimidated that he couldn&#39;t help but whimper and burrow himself deeper into Wes&#39; embrace. Wes chuckled and kissed Nick&#39;s head of soft, light blonde hair - a gesture the boy seemed to appreciate if his tiny coo was any indication - smirking at Clark when the tiny boy huffed at the show of affection.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are lucky I didn&#39;t dismantle these after taking care of my nephews last weekend.&quot; Wes declared as he opened the back door of his SUV to reveal a pair of colorful plastic car seats. Both boys shivered at the sight of them, the infantile thrones just another symbol of how unbelievably little they&#39;d become. Neither felt any better after their cushioned tushies were deposited in those seats, nor after they were buckled into them. Wes closed the back door once both were secured, giving Nick and Clark a rare moment of solitude in the time it took for the man to walk around to the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clark, I - &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39; say anyfing.&quot; Clark cut Nick off before he could even begin his apology. &quot;I don&#39; wanna heaw it. Dis ith aw your fawlt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But - <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Nick. Go whine to your new boyfwiend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick, stunned, could only stare down at his tiny dangling toes as Clark fumed beside him. The silence that settled between the boys was terrible in its weight but lasted only until Wes entered the driver&#39;s seat and brought the beast of a vehicle to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot; Wes mused as he toyed with the controls of his stereo. &quot;Ah, here we go. These are some of my nephews&#39; favorite songs, boys - hope you like &#39;em!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>The wheels on the bus go &#39;round and &#39;round<br />
&#39;Round and &#39;round<br />
&#39;Round and &#39;round<br />
The wheels on the bus go &#39;round and &#39;round<br />
Alllll dayyy looooooonnngg</i> &quot;<br />
<br />
Nick and Clark groaned as Wes pulled the SUV out of the parking lot and out into the world. Both were grateful that the ride to the nearest big-box store was mercifully short, as neither could stand the awkwardness between them for another second (to say nothing of the earworm nursery rhymes that were driving both mad). Wes unstrapped the toddlers from their car seats and began carrying them from the SUV to the entrance, each boy reacting differently to being out in public for the first time. Nick buried his face in the crook of Wes&#39;s shoulder to hide from the curious looks the trio were attracting, some passerby - a few bemused, a few sniffing in disapproval - visibly wondering why both boys were in nothing but shirts and diapers. Clark, meanwhile, met every curious look with the nastiest scowl his cherubic features could muster, a scowl that only deepened when he realized its ineffectiveness (if anything they only seemed to find him cuter like that).<br />
<br />
The one thing the boys did do in unison was shiver as they entered the store at the wave of conditioned air that passed over their bare smooth skin. Both instinctively cuddled a little closer to Wes for warmth, and both whined when the smirking man plopped their diapered tushies side by side in the seat of a shopping cart. The awkwardness between Nick and Clark had been difficult enough to deal with when a backseat separated them, so both were feeling especially uncomfortable being mere inches apart from one another as Wes trollied them into the store and made a beeline for the Baby department. In a sense it was almost a relief for them to be distracted by the items Wes happily tossed into their cart, even if both boys&#39; dread deepened with each potential purchase plucked from the shelf.<br />
<br />
Pacifiers. Bath toys. Snacks. Stuffed animals. Onesies. Jammies. Wes&#39; grin grew in time with the widening of Nick and Clark&#39;s eyes, the man relishing their horror at his illustration of just how long the two could expect to be in diapers. And speaking of...Nick cheerfully added wipes and powder to their bounty before coming upon the final item, a mega-pack of Pampers that the man purposefully showed off to his toddler captives before placing it in the cart. Clark had already suffered a brush with the deep humiliation tied to his infantile incontinence and as such wasn&#39;t as shaken by the sight. Nick, however, went as white as his crinkly undies as he stared down at them and seemed to realize, for the first time, that he&#39;d actually be <i>using</i> his diapers. <i>Repeatedly.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;My gosh, what an adorable pair.&quot; Nick and Clark squeaked in surprise as they looked up at the cheerful middle-aged woman who seemed to have just appeared beside the cart. &quot;Twins? They don&#39;t look identical, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Wes happily rolled with the narrative. &quot;Fraternal twins. The light of my life, these little guys - I don&#39;t know what I would do without them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Well</i>, it certainly seems that they&#39;re enjoying their day out with their daddy.&quot; The woman fussed, neither Nick nor Clark sure what they were doing to make it seem like that was the case. &quot;Though I think <i>mommy</i> would&#39;ve made sure to put them in pants and shoes before going out.&quot;<br />
<br />
One benefit of being that close to Clark was that Nick saw the gleeful glint in his eye right before he pounced on the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy put mommy in a big hole in the backyard!&quot; Clark chirped, loudly enough for several passersby to hear and subsequently stare accusingly at Wes. The fussing woman seemed particularly mortified, and Nick couldn&#39;t help but giggle a bit watching Clark grin from ear to ear as Wes tried to stammer out an explanation to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ha, real imagination this one...&quot; Wes lamely offered as he began pushing the card away. &quot;My wife&#39;s just at work, she&#39;s not, uh...in a hole...&quot;<br />
<br />
He managed to slink away from the scene without having to suffer anything more than a few hard looks. Clark was positively delighted at his small bit of revenge, and to Nick that joy was contagious - which is why he shared in Clark&#39;s dismay when Wes suddenly snuffed it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Real cute.&quot; The man sneered at Clark once they&#39;d gotten to a private corner of the store, the defiant toddler struggling to keep his jaw set beneath Wes&#39; withering gaze. &quot;You like embarrassing people, little guy? Maybe you&#39;d like it if I made you announce something embarrassing to all the nice people you just bothered? Or maybe it&#39;d be better if I made you run around in the buff for a bit so everyone can see for themselves what a <i>baby</i> you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick saw Clark&#39;s resolve start to falter as he was presented with these possibilities, knowing all too well that it was entirely within Wes&#39; power to make them realities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since I&#39;m such a good guy, I&#39;ll let you choose.&quot; Wes smirked and crossed his arms, loving the way Clark squirmed beneath his large, looming frame. &quot;Which&#39;ll it be, Clark? Wanna make an announcement? Or maybe go streaking? Keep in mind that you&#39;ll earn yourself a spanking if you refuse both.&quot;</p>
