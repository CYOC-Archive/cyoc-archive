<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Details appeared on her computer screen and Lisa read them through each of them. Paying particular attention to the current weight listed, eight and a half pounds, height of eight inches at the shoulder, twelve and half from feet to top of head, and a length of ten inches, she went over the additional information she&#39;d entered. Seeing the max height after growing was thirteen inches at the withers, sixteen inches at the top of the head, she also read how max length reached would be nineteen inches, whilst top weight would be no more than twenty-one and half pounds. Going through the rest of the details, she eventually reclined back in her desk chair.<br />
<br />
It&#39;d been almost three weeks, and it&#39;d taken her a fair bit to finally bring herself to scan her brother back into the Chronivac. Scared at first that for some reason it wouldn&#39;t work, she also had to contend with doing it without her brother or anyone else figuring out what she was up to. But now, seeing the information she&#39;d entered appear before her eyes, she felt it was all worth it. The one thing she still was unsure of was whether or not she wanted to change Jeff back, or even if she was able to.<br />
<br />
A quick search through Jeff&#39;s profile, she was alarmed to discover there was nothing left of her brother. Everything she saw indicated he was what he was becoming, a five month old female beagle. Wondering if she was too late, that she&#39;d have to face the fact that her brother was gone, and it was all her fault because of some self-centred prissy attitude of hers and her mucking around with something she was thinking she might have been better off leaving well enough alone, she looked at the screen. Knowing she could enter in new information, that she could transform her brother back by going by memory alone, she understood it wouldn&#39;t be so simple, as she didn&#39;t know everything about her brother, thus there&#39;d be stuff missing. Feeling uncertain, she stared at the computer screen, and tried to sort out what exactly she should do, believing her best options were to either leave her brother the way he was or try to create a new profile for him as a human.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in the house, Jeff wandered from one room to the next. Having gotten used to going about on paws, he was faced by different aspects of what was happening to him. Coming to the living room, he didn&#39;t go in, but instead stood in the doorway and stared at the furniture. Everything so much bigger now, he wasn&#39;t really surprised, as over the past three weeks or so, he&#39;d slowly been shrinking.<br />
<br />
The change so gradual, at first he hadn&#39;t been aware of what was happening. It was only when he became aware of door handles that had shifted upward, tables that seemed higher, and when his transformation lurched forward in a spasm of slight discomfort that left him hornier than he ever been, and desperately humping his bedding for release, then it dawned on him what was happening. Scared at first, he forced him to calm down as he worked out it was part of him turning into a dog. Hoping he wasn&#39;t turning into one of those small yappy things, he watched as everything around him grew bigger around him whilst he continued to try to work out a way to not be a dog. Adjusting his shirt as it slipped off his shoulder, he was no closer to an answer, but, as he looked into the room, he felt certain he might have reached the end of his current transformation, the proof he felt in what he&#39;d done with blankets moments ago.<br />
<br />
He wanted to know his current height and with a glance downward, he rolled his shoulders. Deciding he did want the thing off, he let his shirt, now way too big for him, slip off and fall to the floor. Naked as the day he&#39;d been born, and no longer feeling self-conscious about it, he stepped back and away from the garment, squatted down and gripped the shirt in his teeth. Carrying it through the house, much in the same way a dog would carry something, he slipped out the doggy door that had appeared only recently in the back door. Thinking about his original height of almost six feet tall, he spat out his shirt and trotted across the yard. Squatting to do his business, he looked down at his smaller frame, wished he had a way to measure his height, and guessed he had to be shorter than a foot, but taller than six. Letting his tongue hang out as he started to pant, something that always bothered him, especially after he&#39;d discovered the muscular organ was no longer a human tongue, he finished with his business. Going to look for his shirt, he found it, and picking it up in his teeth, he headed deeper into the yard. Heading for a dog house that had also appeared a few days ago, he was forced to drop to all fours as he crawled inside. Finding it was actually, comfortable, felt, right, proper, natural, going about on all fours, he hurried to stand up the moment he was inside.<br />
<br />
A few inches from him there was a dog bed. Placed within by either his mom or dad, he wasn’t sure which, nor did he care, and carrying his shirt over to it, he dropped it on the dog bed. Turning about in place, he stepped onto the bed, lay down, and curled up on top of his shirt. Staring out the entrance to the dog house, he thought back to how he&#39;d changed so slowly over the pass four weeks, the things he&#39;d discovered, like how his name was Nikki, he found himself bothered by it all, as a lot of it pointed to the fact that he was becoming a bitch, something he still didn&#39;t feel he was ready to become. Rolling over on his side, he looked down at his dick and nut sack, which had shrunk as he&#39;d dropped in size, and he wondered how long he had before he really did have to squat to pee, and if he&#39;d end of attracted to male. Fearing this, he tried to find comfort by telling himself, &quot;Your still human and male, even if you have paws and a ridiculous tongue,&quot; but not finding any solace in the words, he whimpered as he wondered what the next thing to change would be and how long it’d take before he was all dog as still hoped the kind he was becoming wasn’t one the small yappy kind.</p>
