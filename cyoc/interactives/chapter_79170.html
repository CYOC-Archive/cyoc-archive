<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica couldn't believe what she had seen. Nikki had been completely changed by the computer program and had no clue that there was anything different or strange about her and what she was doing. To the contrary, she was acting as though she had been that way all along. Trying not to panic Jessica went back to the computer to see if she could learn more about the workings of the Chronivac program. She pulled up the changes she had made to Nikki's file and looked them over carefully before clicking the question mark icon up on the top corner of the window. The changes themselves were self explanatory so she instead focused on the other options she had selected. By mousing over them she got detailed descriptions of each of the different options and what she had selected for them meant. The duration option determined how long the change would last before the subject reverted to normal, the length of transformation option controlled how long the actual changes took to reach completion. It was the awareness settings that were the most revealing though. By turning off subject awareness, like she had, it meant that the transformed individual would not notice anything strange about themselves. Selecting for reality to adjust meant that things like clothing and housing would change along with the person, not to mention that other people would not see the person as having changed in any way. That explained why Nikki had ended up dressed the way she was as well as why she thought there was nothing unusual about her appearance or actions.<br />
<br />
Now that she understood how the program worked Jessica found herself even more curious about what it could do. First things first though.<br />
<br />
She went to Nikki's file and turned subject awareness on, hit apply and was rewarded by a gasp from Nikki's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing?&quot; Jessica called to her friend, &quot;Can you believe this or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bit of noise as Nikki disentangled herself, then &quot;This is so crazy!&quot;<br />
<br />
An understatement if there ever was one.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Jessica asked, fully expecting Nikki to be furious. As such, her friend's response came as quite the surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly? It's kind of cool in a really weird way,&quot; Nikki giggled. By the sound of her voice she had left her bedroom and was making her way back to the computer, &quot;I know I should be upset, but the humiliation of all this...it's really hot. I mean just thinking about how I have no control over what was done to me is horrible, but because of the changes I'm turned on by it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she finished speaking she arrived in the room, still in the bondage gear that the Chronivac program had transformed her clothing into. There were red welts across her stomach and thighs where she had been hitting herself with the riding crop that the Chronivac had made appear in her room and it was obvious, from the moisture glistening on her exposed thighs, that she had been enjoying herself a great deal, in fact, the way she was squirming and occasionally squeezing her breasts and giving the little weights hanging from her pierced nipples a pull revealed that she was still very aroused.<br />
<br />
Jessica tried not to stare, not that she thought Nikki would be upset, &quot;Okay...but do you want to be changed back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki was silent for a very long while, then softly, in a very timid voice, &quot;If it pleases you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, the mental changes, Nikki was super submissive. This had Jessica even more curious, &quot;Think about how you used to be just earlier today, don't you want to go back to that?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time Nikki nodded so hard the weights hanging from her breasts bounce up and down, the pain causing her to let out a gasp, &quot;Oh yes. It's so humiliating to be this way that I love it. I want to change back so badly, but I have to be a good little pet. A good little pet can't touch its Mistress' property though, and most of all it can’t be disobedient, so I can't change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki dropped to her knees, groveling, &quot;Please let me be the way I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
The most shocking thing about what she was seeing, Jessica realized, was that Nikki was so blatantly turned on by what she was doing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly afraid, Jessica turned back to the computer and quickly set Nikki's file back to its default settings.<br />
<br />
In an instant Nikki was fully clothed in the same outfit she had put on that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Nikki leapt back to her feet, &quot;That was so scary. It was horrible. At first I had no clue, then I knew what had happened and I liked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes were wide with alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually enjoyed how horrible it was,&quot; she shuddered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; Jessica said, equally frightened, but still intrigued, &quot;What should we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget any of it ever happened?&quot; Nikki offered cautiously.<br />
<br />
It was a suggestion Jessica was willing to go along with, but maybe not just yet, &quot;Okay, I guess, but you really had no idea at first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None,&quot; Nikki shook her head, &quot;It all felt totally normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was hard to believe and as crazy as it was, Jessica wanted to see for herself, &quot;I don't believe it. I mean none of it seems possible to begin with, but as strange as it is, I want to see for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki looked at her like she was crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you use the program to do something to me?&quot; Jessica continued, &quot;Think of it as a game. I want to see if I can figure out what's different.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a thoughtful silence Nikki nodded, obviously as curious as Jessica was and maybe starting to understand the implications of having a machine that could change reality, &quot;Okay, but you're sure it won't be permanent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Positive,&quot; Jessica reassured and then walked Nikki through how the different settings worked, making sure that she put for reality to adjust and for subject awareness to be set off. When it came time to make the actual changes she turned away, wanting to be surprised, but there was one thing she made sure to mention, &quot;See about the physical changes option, that might be easier for me to guess since I'll know to look for something rather than having to try and guess what's different about the way I'm thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nikki said slowly, then started to giggle, &quot;Oh wow, the physical changes cover everything. Some of them are really crazy too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don't say what you're doing,&quot; Jessica giggled back, &quot;I want to figure it out on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Nikki was still giggling as she scrolled and clicked her way through a number of different options, &quot;Some of these are pretty out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, pick a crazy one then,&quot; Jessica said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Nikki asked with a nervous giggle.<br />
<br />
That was exactly what she wanted, something really easy to notice and she said as much, &quot;Yes I'm sure. I want something that there's no way for me not to notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you insist...&quot; she trailed off as she went back to clicking and searching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you done yet?&quot; Jessica wondered, shifting her weight from one foot to the other, anxious for things to start and see what it would feel like. She was sure that she would notice the changes and she was curious to find out what her friend had picked for her. All the giggling had her certain that it was something really crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a sec more,&quot; Nikki said happily, &quot;And done. I set the changes to take ten minutes so it might take a few before anything's really noticeable. It's going to be wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; Jessica muttered, looking down at herself, waiting to see when the changes would begin, sure that she would notice them despite subject awareness having been turned off. Even after having seen what happened with her friend she was sure that she would be able to know. After all, if the change was big enough, there was no way she could miss it, right?<br />
<br />
She looked carefully at her hands and arms, wondering what the changes would be and seeing nothing. Absentmindedly she adjusted her bra strap, looking down at her breasts pressing against her shirt, the same c-cup as ever. Everything seemed normal there too, her perky, round breasts pulling the fabric of her shirt tight against her chest. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, though it hadn't even been a minute yet, so there probably wasn't anything to see.<br />
<br />
Nikki was watching her intently, her lips pressed tight as she tried to hide a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jessica wondered.<br />
<br />
Nikki shook her head, apparently not trusting herself to keep from blurting something out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the changes sure are slow starting,&quot; Jessica sighed, &quot;Maybe you should have picked something more drastic. At this rate I might not notice them at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
A minute more passed uneventfully and Jessica was starting to get frustrated at the lack of visible changes, she was also thirsty and at least that was something she could fix. She went to the kitchen, Nikki following closely behind her, and went to the sink to get herself a big glass of water.<br />
<br />
As she drank she continued examining herself, paying careful attention to the pale green skin of her hands, but not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Once again she adjusted her shirt, which she had to admit was probably a bit too small for her, which was a shame since she liked the style, especially the way it clung to her d-cup breasts, which she thought were one of her best features. Big and firm as they were, she had no need to wear a bra to support their roundness, meaning that her large, dark nipples were plainly visible through the fabric. She gently rubbed one through the fabric of her shirt, waiting for the changes to become noticeable, but even her breasts were perfectly normal, and she had been sure that those would have been what Nikki went for when picking out the changes.  <br />
<br />
The sun shining in through the window over the sink felt so good and she stopped stroking herself to brush back her vines and turn her head slightly so that more of her leaves would be in the sun. As she did this she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the window glass, noting how long her vines were and how abundant the leaves growing from them were. They had really gotten long and thick, to the point where they were starting to get unmanageable. Some of the biggest vines were as big around as her little finger and reached down to the small of her back. The largest leaves on them were easily as big as the palm of her hand and some of the ones that had yet to unfurl looked like they were going to be even bigger. The wild tangle framed her pale green face nicely.<br />
<br />
Still waiting to see when she would notice the changes Nikki had picked for her, Jessica turned on the tap to get another glass of water. As the water flowed into the glass Jessica felt her belly bump into the counter and frowned as she looked down at it, the round swell of her midriff just visible past her breasts. She gave her swollen stomach a gentle pat, feeling how smooth and firm it was. As big and ripe as her belly was, it made shopping for clothing difficult. The roundness of her stomach had pushed up her shirt to reveal her belly with its dark and light green stripes. She tried to pull her shirt down over her stomach, but it proved impossible, between her belly and breasts there just was just too much for it to cover. It wasn't too bad though, the sun felt as good on her exposed belly as it felt on her leaves and vines.<br />
<br />
Finishing her second glass of water, she started filling up a third, &quot;I'm not noticing anything yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Nikki looked at her, eyes wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Jessica scowled, &quot;You must have chosen something too subtle, but I'm going to look myself over more thoroughly, just to be sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
She finished her third glass of water and went to her bedroom, closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
On the back of the door was a full length mirror and she looked at herself in it. She could see her dark and light green striped belly, big around as a beach ball, pushing out from under her shirt. Wondering if maybe her change was hidden by her clothing she pulled off her shirt, freeing her enormous triple d-cup breasts from the tight confines of the fabric. Like the rest of her skin they were a smooth pale green, though her nipples, each a puffy two inches long, were a much darker shade. She gently stroked the firm flesh of her breasts, admiring their size and roundness, appropriately resembling a pair of watermelons. Nothing to see there. Frowning, she pulled down her pants and then her panties, using the mirror to examine between her legs. Her flower was the same as ever, nestled amidst a tangle of short, fine vines, pale green leaves closed in a tight bud over its fleshy petals. Gently she stroked those leaves, feeling a rush of warmth run through her. Maybe Nikki had changed her flower in some way? Just to be sure Jessica continued to stroke herself. Responding to the attention her bud began to open, revealing her thick, soft petals, flushed deep yellow with arousal and glistening with sweet nectar.<br />
<br />
Pleasant as what she was doing was, it did nothing to reveal what, if any changes had taken place.<br />
<br />
Forced to admit defeat, she gave her flower one last little rub, sticking her finger deep into its moist interior and further moistening her petals with her one fragrant juices, &quot;Alright Nikki, I've got nothing. Turn on the awareness option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Nikki laughed from the computer.<br />
<br />
Jessica froze in mid stroke, her arousal vanishing as she realized what was going on. The computer had managed to turn her into a watermelon girl without her even noticing it. The flower that her pussy had become folded closed into a tight little bud, nectar dripping between its sealed leaves. Above it, her massive, watermelon striped belly heaved with every fearful breath she took and her impossibly large and firm breasts shook. The vines and leaves that had taken the place of her hair rustled as she moved, running her hands over her changed body, shocked that she had changed so much without noticing. It had all felt so normal while it had been happening, until Nikki had changed the settings on the computer. The most shocking part had to be that it still felt so normal.  Her massive breasts, so big that they actually rested on top of her heavy, swollen belly felt so natural, more than that, even though she knew perfectly well that she had only been the way she was now for a few minutes, she had recollections of having been a watermelon girl for all her life thanks to the adjust reality setting.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Nikki called to her.<br />
<br />
Jessica let out a nervous laugh, &quot;It's crazy. I know that this isn't normal, but it feels like it is and I even have memories that go with it. I actually remember being a little plant girl, that when I hit puberty the bud between my legs started to get bigger and that when it started opening into a flower I started playing with it and accidentally pollinated myself. That's actually how I remember it, that I pollinated myself back in high school and since then my breasts and belly kept growing as I got riper. Again, that's actually how I remember it, getting riper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that is crazy,&quot; Nikki let out a nervous laugh as well, &quot;Do you want me to change you back yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe it or not, no,&quot; Jessica was shocked by her decision, but she wanted to talk more about the crazy memories she had, &quot;You mind if I tell you how crazy all this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not at all. It's actually really cool, this program, now that we sort of know what it does,&quot; came Nikki's eventual response.<br />
<br />
Jessica was in total agreement with that.<br />
<br />
Slowly she got dressed, marveling at how she automatically adjusted for the weight of her belly and breasts when she bent down to pick up her clothing. When she left her room to join Nikki in the living room, she without even thinking about it, sat down in a chair that was placed by a window, letting the sun shine in on her vine-hair and her exposed belly.<br />
<br />
Nikki stared at her, then smiled, &quot;What's it feel like?&quot;<br />
<br />
That took some thinking, since 'normal' was the first thought that sprang to mind, but that wasn't quite true. After some thinking and enjoying the sun, Jessica reached a strange conclusion, &quot;Pretty good actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt the same way about my changes,&quot; Nikki agreed, &quot;They freaked me out, but that panic, because of what the changes did to my mind, only made me like it more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is kind of different,&quot; Jessica said, &quot;For me it's that the sun feels so good on my leaves and skin and my breasts feel so tender that even the pressure of my shirt on them feels good and I like the heaviness of my belly. Like I said, it's crazy and I have all these crazy memories that go with it. I told you that I remember pollinating myself in high school and how a few months later, during summer vacation, my belly first started to get ripe. It was so slow that it was another year before it was really visible and it's been growing since, along with my breasts and they kept getting more sensitive as they got bigger. Like right now they're so sensitive just putting on my shirt was enough to get me blossoming.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both burst out laughing at that statement.<br />
<br />
When they recovered Nikki looked back at the computer, &quot;So, should I change you back now?&quot;</p>
