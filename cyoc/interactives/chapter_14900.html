<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty quickly grabbed the remote from Paul’s hand, before he stepped back. Paul immediately turned around and reached for the remote, when Ty tossed it towards Jason.<br />
<br />
Then Ty turned around and battled Paul. Ty immediately gave himself some additional strength and muscle, and he was able to ward off any of Paul’s kicks and punches. <br />
<br />
Ty then extended his hand and wished for Paul to freeze in time! Paul froze immediately, followed by him rapidly losing his muscles. Ty then looked at himself, and realized that he started to grow more muscular!<br />
<br />
Tyrone attacked Jason, who was now holding the remote! Tyrone grabbed him from behind, and started to choke him. Jason looked up and immediately tossed the remote to Peter, who was standing on the other side of the lot.<br />
<br />
Jason then grabbed hold of Tyrone’s arm with both hands; he bent forward and completely hurled Tyrone over him, making him fly upside down through the air until he crashed with his back into the wall. Tyrone was in a daze for a moment, until he got back on his feet and charged right at Jason. But Jason was prepared. He was a master in martial arts, and he patiently waited for the big goon to charge at him.<br />
<br />
Jason curled his fingers and bounced on the balls of his feet. As soon as Tyrone came within reach, he punched the big man in his stomach with three consecutive blows, which landed at lightning speed. Tyrone just stumbled back briefly, until Jason spun around and gave him a mighty blow in the head with his foot. Jason punched him three more times, before Tyrone collapsed on to the floor. He was knocked out, and his muscles suddenly shrunk from his body, and appeared on Jason’s. He also gained his tattoos: An abstract pattern down his right arm and a scorpion on his left bicep!<br />
<br />
Peter was standing at the other corner, holding the remote in his hand. He was following the action between Ty and Jason, and he was guarding the large box. For the moment he had lost track of Randy, who quietly slipped away.<br />
<br />
Peter had lost track of Randy, who was quietly approaching him from behind. Randy then charged at Peter from behind, knocking him off his feet and sending him tumbling on the floor.<br />
<br />
The blow caused Peter to let go of the remote, sending the little, and plastic device flying through the air.<br />
<br />
For the moment, both Ty and Jason panicked, when they saw the remote flying through the air.<br />
<br />
“Oh No! NOOOO!!” Jason shouted, as he realized that Peter had lost the remote.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Kent leaped in the air, caught the remote in midair, before coming back down on his back.<br />
<br />
Jason was very relieved that Kent had caught it, and he noticed that they were now safe, for the moment.<br />
<br />
Peter got up and quickly turned around to face Randy. He then made a fist, and he blew these massive rays of firepower at the big bully. With each salvo, he knocked randy further back, and Randy finally fell on the floor after having absorbed the third shot of Peter’s energy rays. As soon as Randy passed out, his big, muscular body began to shrink, as the bodybuilder lost his muscles and his strength.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Peter gained his muscles, and he was practically the biggest of the ChaosRiders!<br />
<br />
As soon as all three captors were down, the ChaosRiders called the authorities. The police and the ambulance were there to assist anyone who needed help, while the police officers quickly arrested Randy, Tyrone and Paul.<br />
<br />
As soon as the three goons were thrown in police cars and taken away, Kent turned towards Jason, Peter and Ty, while holding the remote in his hand.<br />
<br />
“They’re all gone now! Yay! I can finally do this…” he cheered, as he pressed the button on the remote with his thumb.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, Kent! What are you doing? The bomb is gonna…” he shouted.<br />
<br />
BOOOOM!!!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, foam was pouring from the large box, covering the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“Soap? You turned the dynamite into soap?” Jason wondered out load, as he just looked on in amazement as a massive amount of foam was pouring from the box, which was now covering their shoes.<br />
<br />
All three, Kent, Ty and Peter just burst out in laughter, as Jason looked on at the ground.<br />
<br />
“Well, I say we head on home, and celebrate the addition of the newest member of the ChaosRiders!” Ty suggested.<br />
<br />
Ty turned towards Kent, and decided to pass on his muscles to his little brother. Kent’s chest, arms and legs immediately began to swell, as he found his muscles rapidly increasing in size. Then tattoos appeared on his chest and forearms. He gained a tattoo of a dragon on his chest and one of a tiger on his forearm!<br />
<br />
Kent then walked up to his bike, which was still parked outside. Ty immediately turned into a motorcycle, just like the one that Jason, Peter and Ty had. Then, the four masked riders mounted their bikes, as they rode off to the street, cheering on their glorious victory.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go, ChaosRiders!!” Jason shouted, followed by Ty, Peter, and Kent.<br />
<br />
The four riders rode their motorcycles through the streets of the city, knowing that the city was a safer place, as long as they were on the streets!</p>
