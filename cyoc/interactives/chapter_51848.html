<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You manage to get to your room and close the door. As you lean against it you had to wonder how the girls were able to hold you down. Something very strange was going on. Well you should be safe enough in... your room? What happened to your room? The posters you had of your favorite bands were gone. The only poster that you had before that was still up was of Hanna Montana. Your walls were now baby pink. Your bed had pink sheets and a Hanna Montana cover on it. You look at your trophy case and are horrified to see that your trophies are gone to be replaced by porcelain dolls. Fearing what you'd find you went to your closet and opened it. It was empty which was sort of a relief but at the same time it made you more nervous.<br />
<br />
Your door opened and you mom asked, &quot;What are you doing back here Jimmy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I hate that name Mom,&quot; you said. &quot;The girls attacked me and held me down. I was able to get up after twenty minutes and ran back here. What happened to my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't suppose to see it until tomorrow,&quot; your mom said with a frown on her face.<br />
<br />
Just then the girls and Claire's mom came in and Claire said, &quot;Oh shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit is right young lady,&quot; your mom said wagging a finger at Claire. &quot;You girls were suppose to keep him there and transform him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He has a strong will Auntie Crystal,&quot; Claire said.<br />
<br />
Your mom sighed and said, &quot;I was afraid that he had that strong will. This is going to make things more difficult. He won't accept his new life as easily. Well we'll need to transform him now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were stunned as your mom and Claire's approached you. Claire had called your mom Auntie Crystal but she wasn't related. As you were grabbed you panicked and tried to get away again. &quot;He does have a strong will,&quot; Claire's mom said with a smile. &quot;I can see why he was able to fight the girls off. Girls, we need some help here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley, Hannah, Lily, and Kelly came over and grabbed you as well. As you struggled you felt a calmness descend upon you and you stopped struggling. &quot;Come get his clothes off Claire,&quot; your mom said.<br />
<br />
Something was definitely wrong here. You wanted to struggle and get away but your body wouldn't respond. Claire was able to remove your shoes, socks, pants, and boxers with ease. The ones holding you had to let go in order for Claire to get you shirt off and in that moment the calmness lifted and you made a dash for the door. Unfortunately your mom and the others grabbed you again and that calmness descended on you again. &quot;You brought his new dress, shoes, socks, and panties with you?&quot; your mom asked. What was she talking about? You're not across dresser.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's out in the hall Auntie Crystal,&quot; Claire said. &quot;I'll go get it.&quot; Claire went out and came back in with a box. Opening it she took out a white dress, what looked like white dress shoes like what a school girl would wear, white ankle socks with frills on them, a white bra, and white panties. You wanted to fight and get away but you couldn't. Claire picked up the panties and slipped them on you. Your dick made a bulge in the front of them but no one seemed to care. The socks were next to be put on then the shoes. She picked up the bra and slipped your arms through the straps helped by the others holding you. After she had hooked the bra she picked up the dress and proceeded to put it on you. As your arms were pulled through the sleeves you felt the calmness lift a bit. It didn't last long though as all hands were on you again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok we can let her go now,&quot; your mom said and everyone let go. You immediately tried to take the clothes off but for some reason they wouldn't come off. No matter what you tried they wouldn't come off. &quot;It's no use trying to take them off before your transformation is finished Jamie,&quot; your mom said with an amused smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have to come off,&quot; you said still trying to get them off. Finally giving up you asked, &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we're changing you into a girl,&quot; your mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a boy Mom,&quot; you pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for much longer,&quot; your mom said. &quot;Oh you'll fight the transformation but in the end you will be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because you put girl clothes on me doesn't mean I'll become a girl,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they were ordinary clothes they wouldn't change you,&quot; your mom said. &quot;But they aren't ordinary. Those clothes are enchanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no such thing as enchanted clothes,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you take them off then?&quot; your mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be some sort of glue on them,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me then,&quot; your mom said as she practically dragged you to the bathroom. Once there she said, &quot;I'm sure you need to pee so go.&quot; At her words you realized that you did need to pee. Lifting the seat up you tried to release your dick from the panties. &quot;You can't do it like that,&quot; your mom said with a smile. &quot;Put the seat back down then turn around and pull your panties down. Then hike up your dress and sit down.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged your shoulders and did as your mom said. You realized that as soon as you had decided to follow your mom's advice you were able to move the panties. When you noticed this you figured that you could pee like you always did and had just decided to do that when the panties pulled themselves up. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you they were enchanted,&quot; your mom said. &quot;The only way you'll be able to pee without soiling those clothes will be to sit and pee like a girl. Oh and I should warn you that if you do soil them you'll regress to at least a toddler.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed and followed what your mom had said. After you were about to get up when your mom told you to wipe first. She said that if you didn't and just pulled your panties up the little bit of pee left could trigger the age regression. Not wanting that you wiped making sure there was no pee coming out of your dick. &quot;How long will I have to keep these on?&quot; you asked resigning yourself to wearing them. Didn't mean you had to like it though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with your will I'd say a month,&quot; your mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A month!&quot; you said shocked. &quot;What about school? I can't go to school wearing this. I'll be laughed at and more than likely get beat up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you don't have to worry about that,&quot; your mom said. &quot;Part of the enchantment involves altering people's perceptions. All they'll see is a sixteen year old girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about gym though?&quot; you asked. &quot;We have to take a shower after. How am I suppose to do that when I can't take these clothes off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll come off for a shower,&quot; your mom said. &quot;The altered perception will last long enough for you to take your shower. As long as you put at least one piece of the clothing on within thirty minutes no one will see you as a boy.&quot; You started to think that you might be able to get rid of them but your mom dashed those hopes by saying, &quot;They'll put themselves back on you after an hour if you don't. If you keep your panties on you'll be able to change for gym. We have an enchanted swimsuit for when you go swimming. Now come back to your room Jamie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you calling me Jamie?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jimmy and James aren't exactly girl names,&quot; your mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie is a boy's name too,&quot; you pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it's also a girl's name,&quot; your mom said. &quot;Consider yourself lucky that I went with Jamie. I had been thinking of calling you Jill or Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once back in your room Claire's mom asked, &quot;Is Jamie going to come back over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to you your mom asked, &quot;Do you want to go back over to your Auntie May's?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; you said. &quot;I don't really want to go out looking like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that big of a deal,&quot; Lily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a girl though,&quot; you said. &quot;It's expected that you could be wearing a dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These clothes have been used before,&quot; your mom said. &quot;Tell her girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was Luke,&quot; Lily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was Henry,&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was Adam,&quot; Ashley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was Kevin,&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
You were shocked at this. After a moment you asked, &quot;Why were you changed?&quot;</p>
