<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad got out of the bed with a groan and made his way to his wife’s side of the bed. He then attempted to pick up the screaming toddler so he could carry her to the changing table but she fussed so much that he couldn’t grab a hold of her. Cursing under his breath he resolved to just change her right there on the bed. Going over to the changing table he grabbed the supplies also taking a changing mat and carried them back to the bed. Unfolding the padded mat he slipped it underneath Jan’s bottom so that none of her mess would get on the sheets while he was changing her diaper.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the baby girl’s struggles Brad reached down and undid the tapes on her pamper, pulling down the front to reveal the enormous poo he had spied earlier. Using the padding as a glove he managed to pull the large brown log free from between her butt cheeks. He then used the cleaner parts of the diaper to wipe up as much of her bottom as possible before setting it off to the side. Grabbing the baby wipes Brad was forced to grab both of Jan’s legs with his hand, holding them straight up in the air as he cleaned her butt. “Jesus Jan, can’t you at least hold still so I can wipe you” he complained as the toddler continued to struggle, though her cries had started to lessen the moment he began wiping away her poo. A minute later she stopped altogether and looking at her Brad saw she had resorted to sucking on her thumb, her face still slightly red from all the bawling. After he was done wiping her he lifted her legs up and gave her a vigorous shaking of baby powder on her behind. Grabbing a clean pamper Brad struggled to get it on her having to let go of her legs to use both hands. Since Jan wouldn’t stop moving her legs he was forced to try something different and instead taped up both sides of the diaper. Holding both sides he reached out and hooked one of her feet then a few seconds later the other. Once that was done he pulled both her legs through the leg holes and slid the diaper up and around her bottom like it was a pair of pull ups.<br />
<br />
After he finished changing her dirty diaper for the second time in less than twenty four hours Brad expected his wife to at least thank him.<br />
<br />
How very wrong he was.<br />
<br />
“It’s about time you took care of my poo poo. You know this is all your fault right cause you kept me waiting all god damn night and now I’m feeling cranky as hell. I hope you’re happy you selfish jackass…”<br />
<br />
Hearing that was the straw that broke the camel’s back.<br />
<br />
Brad now realized that Jan was even worse as a toddler. He had hoped that the physical regression into a two year old would have at least changed her personality a little and make her less domineering. And that by being a baby she would act nicer to him and others and also have a child-like nature. Looking over at the Chronivac Brad knew that using it was his only real chance of fixing his wife and had already begun walking toward it before he had even finished his thought.<br />
<br />
“Hey what are you doing? Don’t walk away when I’m talking to you” Jan said moving to stand up on the bed.<br />
<br />
Ignoring her Brad grabbed the device from the nightstand and opened up her profile. He left her age unchanged as he preferred for her to stay a toddler in diapers, having somewhat enjoyed changing her despite her constant insults. No, he was going to change her personality, that was the real problem with her and he knew that now.<br />
<br />
“Quit playing with that stupid remote and pay attention to me” she shouted angrily stomping her feet, unhappy that her husband was ignoring her.<br />
<br />
Still giving her the cold shoulder Brad went through her mental statistics and found “Dominance over Husband” which was set a 100% and explained her constant bitchiness. He quickly changed it to 40% that way he’d have a slight edge over her. Below that option he found one called “Dominance over Children” which was set at 90%. He changed that one to 80% since he felt it was a little too high. As he scrolled down the list Brad was shocked when he saw that “Sexual Drive” was only 2% and quickly upped it to 85%. He wasn’t sure if sex was still something he did with Jan given she was 2 years old but he’d figure that out later. He made a few more changes that would hopefully increase her kindness, love and understanding before he felt confident that he had fixed all the problem areas.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jan was getting dangerously close to throwing another tantrum.<br />
<br />
“If you don’t start paying attention to me right now I’m going to start crying again” she threatened loudly, “Is that what you want Brad, for me to start crying again?”<br />
<br />
“No, this is what I want” he said pointing the device at Jan and hit “execute”.<br />
<br />
Jan froze suddenly her eyes going wide and angry expression disappearing as the changes took effect. The toddler looked dazed for a moment before regarding him with a small smile.<br />
<br />
“Hi honey, um why are you pointing a tv remote at me?” she asked confused before smelling something stinky in the air. Looking down she noticed the poopy pamper still lying open on the bed along with the changing mat and baby supplies.<br />
<br />
“Oh honey did you change my diaper in bed for me? How nice and thoughtful of you to do, thank you so much” Jan remarked as Brad pocketed the Chronivac smiling at how well it worked, his wife was no longer acting like a total bitch to him but instead treating him with respect and kindness.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome Jan. You know I’d do anything for a cute baby girl like you” he said as he pocketed the Chronivac. Walking over to the bed he picked up and wrapped the used diaper to keep it from stinking up the room and threw it away in the diaper genie. He then came back and got the supplies quickly returning them to the changing table.<br />
<br />
“Brad could you be a dear and take me downstairs and put me in my playpen” Jan asked holding up her arms as a sign she wanted to be picked up.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing” Brad smiled as he walked over to her.<br />
<br />
“But first how about we get rid of your night gown” he said as he kneeled down in front of the baby girl.<br />
<br />
Reaching down he grabbed the bottom of her night gown and pulled it up and over her head before tossing it onto the floor, an action made easier since she was holding up her arms. The reason Brad did this was because her really wanted to see Jan go around in just her diaper, running around completely naked save for the pampers taped to her bottom.<br />
<br />
Seeing her once again reaching up with outstretched arms Brad grinned as he picked up his toddler wife, holding her back with one hand and cradling her diapered bottom with the other.<br />
<br />
He then carried her out of the bedroom down the stairs and into the living room which he saw hadn’t changed that much in the reality shift. The couches and recliner were still there as was the large flat screen TV resting on top of the entertainment center. The only real noticeable changes was the fact that the floor was now littered with baby toys appropriate for a toddler and a dark blue playpen with black mesh netting exactly like the one up in their bedroom the inside of which had a bunch of stuffed animals. As he carried her over to it Brad caught a glimpse of a highchair in the kitchen as he walked by the doorway.<br />
<br />
“There you go baby girl, go ahead and have fun” he encouraged as he set her down inside the baby prison, giving Jan a playful swat on her diapered butt.<br />
<br />
“Yes dear” she giggled as she toddled over and started playing with her collection of stuffed animals.<br />
<br />
He watched her wrestle around with them for half a minute before remembering the device in his pocket.<br />
<br />
Curious and wanting to find out more about his new reality he had created Brad decided to use this time to search the Chronivac for answers. Pulling it out of his pocket he started by scrolling through the information on Jan to figure out how it was possible for them to still be husband and wife when she was physically only two years old, which was way under the legal limit. Looking through the data it didn’t take Brad long before he found the answer. Apparently the Chronivac had made it so Jan had contradicted a rare virus a few days after Robin’s thirteenth birthday which regressed her back to two years old and caused her to stop aging as well. However while her body was made physically younger her mental state remained that of an adult. So even though she looked like a baby she was technically considered an adult in the eyes of the law which meant he was legally allowed to remain married to her. And since her muscles could never fully develop she wasn’t able to potty train and would be forced to remain in diapers for basically the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
Brad couldn’t believe that she actually spent the last 3 years as a toddler.<br />
<br />
As he read further he found out that the virus only halted her physical aging so she would still end up dying in 60 years. While it was sad to die as a baby he supposed it was better than continuing to live forever as one or dying as a wrinkly old woman. Continuing to look through the information Brad came across something interesting in the section on sex, it said that Jan was still capable of having orgasms and producing semen thought not as much as an adult would. The Chronivac had it listed as a side effect of the virus it had fabricated to explain her sudden regression. Brad smiled at this grateful that intimate relations were still possible between the two of them. It wouldn’t be exactly the same as before but he’d find a way to make it work and she was cute and adorable as a baby that he wouldn’t mind getting it on with her. While it seemed wrong in a sense Brad reminded himself that she had a grown up mind and any sex would be consensual.<br />
<br />
A young voice broke him out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Hey why are you messing around with that remote honey?” Jan asked.<br />
<br />
Taking his eyes off the device Brad noticed she had stopped playing with her animals and was now standing at the edge of the playpen, gripping the padded railing with her hands as she stared up at him with curious eyes.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing Jan, just something I got in the mail yesterday” he lied not wanting to reveal to his wife what the Chronivac was just yet.<br />
<br />
Despite having changed her personality he wasn’t sure if he could trust her with the knowledge of it so he decided to keep her in the dark for now.<br />
<br />
“Oh alright then” she said shrugging it off.<br />
<br />
The toddler just stood there moving her body back and forth which continuing to grip the railing, an action that suggested she was bored.<br />
<br />
“Brad could you maybe play with me for a little while before you have to go to work?” she asked nicely.<br />
<br />
He took a quick look at the clock; her tantrum earlier had woken him up earlier than usual giving him some free time. And plus it would be nice to spent some time with his newly nice regressed wife after years of being yelled at and belittled by her.<br />
<br />
“Of course I can sweetie” he said placing the Chronivac on a nearby table and climbing inside the playpen with her. <br />
<br />
Brad then grabbed one of the nearby stuffed animals and played a rousing game of keep away with her, laughing as Jan toddled around on her smaller legs trying to take the toy from him. There were moments when she tripped and fell forward but he caught and helped her regain her balance before she once again resumed the chase. After ten minutes of that Brad switched to play wrestling with the toddler, lying on his back and rolling around with her while being careful not to accidently hurt her. As he wrestled with her his hands kept finding their way to her diaper which he found himself touching and even groping quite a bit. A few instances he had his hand in between her legs and squeezing the crinkly padding for more than five seconds, pressing lightly to feel her crotch underneath. As for Jan she was well aware of her husband’s actions and was very much okay with it, smiling and grinning as he invaded her privacy multiple times. Feeling the front of his pants tighten and realizing he was getting a little too aroused Brad moved his hands up and away from her diaper, instead using them to tickle the two year old. Jan instantly squealed with laughter squirming around as he assaulted her with his fingers. She attempted to crawl away a couple of times but he tickled her so much she ended up falling on her back a few seconds later.<br />
<br />
A couple minutes later found Jan lying on her back after a particularly vicious tickling, trying to catch her breath. Breathing in and out she smiled before reaching down and began to finger the front of her pamper while looking up at Brad with a thoughtful gaze.<br />
<br />
She then reveals that she…</p>
