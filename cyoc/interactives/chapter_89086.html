<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Monday morning.  Dustin had left early for school.  Di had driven off to class at college.  June had left for work.  Mark was at home, thinking about the argument he had had with June.  He couldn&#39;t help if he couldn&#39;t get work.  And there was no way in hell he was going to clean house, cook, or volunteer in the community with his free time.  No way!  And why did June always have to rub his nose in it that she had a steady job.  <br />
<br />
It was at a sex shop!  June had always dressed more sexily since starting that business, and Mark didn&#39;t like that she was displaying herself to the world.  June argued that she could dress how she chose, all about &quot;female empowerment&quot; or some such bullshit.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Mark knew that June stayed because she needed him.  Women were all overly emotional like that.<br />
<br />
Mark finished his second cup of coffee, and had to pee.  He got up and headed to the bathroom.  He relieved himself and flushed the toilet, at which point the toilet decided that it was done being used and revolted again.  The toilet was clogged.  Fortunately, Mark was a plumber, but this was not a big job.  There was a plunger in the bathroom attached to his and June&#39;s bedroom, since that was where Mark usually needed it.  He left the bathroom and walked down the hall, entering his bedroom.  As Mark crossed his room to enter the bathroom on the opposite side, he noticed that June had left her dresser drawers open.  Mark rolled his eyes.  <br />
<br />
He shuffled over to the dresser to shut the drawers.  As he went to do so, he caught a glimpse inside the top one.  It was full of his wife&#39;s underwear, with a great variety of panties and bras.  Mark stared for a second, then shut the drawer.  He resumed walking toward the bathroom, shaking off the thought that was in his head.  He had, just for a second, wondered what it would be like to wear his wife&#39;s frilly underwear.  But that was dumb.  Mark was a man, and certainly no faggot.  Mark retrieved the plunger and headed back to the other bathroom.  He finished his &quot;repairs&quot; and headed back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
He rummaged through the magazines stacked on the table.  He was looking for a fishing magazine, or sports magazine, or some other magazine he had subscribed to.  As he looked, his gaze fell on an underwear catalog that had been sent to his wife.  He admired the woman on the front cover.  She was dressed only in cotton underwear and a push-up bra.  She was a supermodel, and was of course gorgeous, and Mark found himself staring at her.  He looked at her crotch, noticing intently that it was so smooth.  The panties hugged her crotch so tightly.  Mark wondered what it would be like to feel panties hug his crotch tightly.  Without truly thinking about it, Mark began flipping through the catalog.  He admired the contents, especially the bras and panties.  He looked at how shapely the model&#39;s breasts were, and how they were so good looking in these bras.<br />
<br />
He stared for a while, then caught himself again.  &quot;Mark, what the hell is wrong with you buddy?&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;These chicks are hot, but who cares about their underwear?&quot;  Better to take them off so we can see the real goods, eh?&quot; Mark reassured himself.  But right after his thoughts continued, &quot;Better to take them off and give them to me... Better if I was the one wearing them...&quot;  Mark couldn&#39;t shake the thoughts.<br />
<br />
He was drawn back into his bedroom.  He sat on the bed, staring at the dresser.  He was trying to mentally justify it to himself, one way or another.  One side of his brain was trying to tell him why he should be having no part of this, and the other side was telling him how nice it would be and how it wouldn&#39;t be hurting anything.  The problem was Mark couldn&#39;t figure out which side was the angel and which side was the devil.<br />
<br />
Finally one side won out.  Mark stood up, and slowly opened the top drawer of his wife&#39;s dresser.  &quot;It&#39;s no big deal.  Just try it and you&#39;ll be done.  No one will find out.  You might like it.  Get it overwith and you can stop thinking about it.  You&#39;ll never think about it again...&quot; Mark&#39;s internal dialogue kept on going as he looked over the undergarments in the drawer.<br />
<br />
Mark gingerly selected a simple pair of black cotton panties from the drawer.  He also picked a matching black bra.  He set the items on the bed, then proceeded to pull off all of his clothes, until he stood naked in the room.  He picked up the panties.  He took deep breaths and his heart has pounding.  He slowly stepped into the leg holes, then drew the panties up his legs.  He pulled them up against his crotch.  <br />
<br />
Mark was already hard, but this made his member seem about to explode, but Mark was able to hold it.  The tiny panties could not contain Mark&#39;s package.  His cock stuck out and was pressed against his belly, but the thrill Mark got from wearing the panties was like nothing he had ever experienced.  Chills went up and down Mark&#39;s spine and he gasped at the feeling.  They felt wonderful.  It was so weird, since they didn&#39;t fit right, but Mark felt he understood why women wore these.  The look and the feel was simply divine.<br />
<br />
Mark turned and took the bra.  He put the straps over his shoulders and pressed the cups against his chest.  Mark pulled the straps behind him and tried to hook them together.  He missed.  He tried again, and still did not succeed.  Mark tried hooking that bra over and over again until he finally, by luck, caught one hook.  He was able to work the other hook on, and collapsed, sitting on the bed.  That was way too difficult.  Mark wondered how women did it so easily.  Mark looked down at his flat chest.  The bra cupped nothing but air, and the cups stuck out from his chest, but Mark couldn&#39;t help but feel satisfied.  He kept thinking about what it would be like to have breasts for his bra to support.<br />
<br />
Mark walked around the room, and enjoyed the feeling of the underwear as he walked.  He was hard the whole time, and eventually he couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  He ran into the bathroom and shot his load into the toilet.  &quot;Well, that&#39;s over then,&quot; thought Mark.  Relieved, he cleaned up and went back into the room.  He removed his wife&#39;s underwear and placed it back in the dresser where he found them.  He was thinking about returning to the kitchen when he looked once again at the variety of panties and bras in the drawer.  He got hard once again.  &quot;So soon?!&quot; he thought, outraged.  But his other thoughts could not be denied.  <br />
<br />
He spent the rest of the day trying on different panties and bras.  He loved the feel of them.  His favorites were the girliest.  They were the silks or satins, they had lots of frills, and lace.  By the late afternoon he had tried almost everything, and his balls hurt from the constant hard-on.  He had let himself go more than once, but fortunately didn&#39;t manage to soil anything.  Dustin would be home soon.  Mark reluctantly put everything back and put on his male clothes.  He walked back to the room and watched TV.  Before long Dustin came home.  He went up to his room without saying a word.<br />
<br />
Just then the phone rang.  Mark got up and answered it.  He listened, then responded: &quot;Oh hey, Paula!  How&#39;s it going buddy? ... Yeah ... Yeah I&#39;d love to catch the game ... At Dino&#39;s on Wednesday? ... Oh yeah, happy hour! ... You got it!  I&#39;ll be there!  Right, woman, see ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was going to see the game on happy hour with a buddy.  He didn&#39;t realize that the buddy would once have been Sam.  But it was perfectly normal to hang out with Paula.  She was just another one of the &quot;guys&quot; ...sort of.<br />
<br />
Before long, June returned, and later Di did is well.  Mark kept feeling bad about what he had done earlier, but he also kept wondering if he could try it a little more.  Surely a little more wouldn&#39;t hurt anything...</p>
