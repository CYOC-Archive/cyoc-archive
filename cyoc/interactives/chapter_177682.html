<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were still biting your overly red lips in pleasure as you were still experiencing the biggest hit of dopamine that you had ever felt before. You hated that you were enjoying the dopamine hits, as it looked like you were enjoying the new changes that Amazimanda, Samantha and Sindy were giving you on the outside, whereas internally, you hated every single one. You hated every new addition from the nose to your breasts honked. You hated how sensitive those areas were, making you giggle and laugh every time they squeezed or merely even grazed them. You hated how your breasts and butt jiggled every time you laughed. But most of all, you hated how little you could express your displeasure, shock, annoyance and hate for everything that they were doing to you. You now didn&#39;t look like yourself anymore. You didn&#39;t dare look into a mirror, because you would hate to see the full picture of yourself. There were too many alterations to see before you could even take a mere glimpse of yourself. You hated it. You hated how alien it was. You never expected to be abducted by aliens, confused to see the aliens to be alien clown girls, and then given breasts, a big bubblebutt and a red nose. And you hated that every time that they honked a part of you, you were forced to enjoy it. Before the dopamine even faded out, the streamers of energy, flowing like silk, started to surround your pure white clown face.<br />
<br />
You could feel your face getting softer, more feminine. The aspects of your face were becoming far more like Amazimanda&#39;s and the nerdy clowns, removing more of what made you you. Your eyebrows started to shrink back into your skin as the streams of energy bounced upon your face creating your new drawn-like eyebrows. As they bounced on your face, you clenched your eyelids down, letting the flowing energy shade your eyelids into a pastel pink like your cheeks. As the energy streams continued to bounce on your skin, they poked on two small love hearts below your eyes and above your cheeks. You didn&#39;t notice them as the feeling of the streams of energy jabbing at your skin was not pleasant at all. It was like being stung by some unknown force. You couldn&#39;t do anything to stop it, so you just took it. You start to feel your features soften more. Your hands start to go more feminine, as do your legs. The natural muscle that you have is altering to become like the clowns in body. You didn&#39;t even notice it happening, and due to your sight being mostly taken up by your huge breasts and by you completely unable to move, you won&#39;t be able to notice it at all. But you did feel this next change. You felt all the energy being focused in your lips and facial muscles. You felt it all strain away, swimming around you, it annoyed you, but what you were about to do next annoyed you more. Your body, due to the energy, was forcing your lips to smile. You tried to get it to stop, but whatever impact you had was being lost. Your impact to tried before faded. It was impossible to get yourself to stop smiling. All this struggle meant that Amazimanda was having a whale of a time, laughing and grinning away, even gesturing to you to smile more by lifting up her fingers to her own huge smile, in which she was giggling while doing so. Every part of you continued to get your smile to stop, but the energy was too strong. You already had a moderate smile on your lips that was getting bigger and bigger. You couldn&#39;t let this smile defeat the last bit of you showing your true colours for these clown creeps, but whatever this energy did made you crumble trying to prevent your smile. You couldn&#39;t handle it much longer and at your last attempt you simply felt your efforts drop as your toothy grin just shot up at the clowns. Your true colours were now only shown through half of your face, but even then, that wasn&#39;t enough to show how much you hated this to the clowns. You couldn&#39;t try it afterwards as the closest that you could get it to stop smiling was still a big, warm smile on your red lips. You felt weak, as if you just tried to lift several weights of your chest, but the energy got the better of you. It felt like you were going to either break a sweat or burst into tears, but the emotions on your face displayed a different story.<br />
<br />
Amazimanda, of course, overjoyed to see you smile a big, happy and friendly smile. She giggled in delight at your smile, embracing you in a big, friendly hug. You, thankfully, didn&#39;t return it. Even if you wanted to, you couldn&#39;t move. She then decided to give you an incredibly long kiss on your big smiling lips, which immediately started another dopamine hit. You couldn&#39;t explain how she was doing it, she just had that power to. Could it possibly be an alien power of hers? You could never know, and you couldn&#39;t talk about it as you were forced to bite your lips again in pleasure that Amazimanda kissed you. You couldn&#39;t care less that Amazimanda kissed you, but your body shown otherwise. You couldn&#39;t stop yourself. It felt so much like an out of body experience to see yourself doing these things that you had no control over. You couldn&#39;t even say how you felt about all of this, but you felt like Amazimanda would have done something even if you spoke a single mere vowel out of your mouth. She then reached under your shirt again and squeezed your breasts.<br />
<br />
HONK! HONK!<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t even shocked at this point anymore. It meant so little to you that they would do this to you again. All your other additions honked, so it just became a guessing game of where she would honk next. You didn&#39;t even laugh out loud like before, you only giggled loud enough through your lip bites. Amazimanda did as she had done before, fell onto the floor into a big laughing fit, which shown off all the areas of her body that were squeezed into her clownish costume. The two nerdy clowns did the same, though their laughs were filled with nerdy nose snorts as they tried to breathe in. You just felt so defeated hearing their laughter for what seemed to be the thousandth time. It just became white noise at this point, blending in with the backdrop that was this insane clown spaceship. <br />
<br />
&quot;*HehehahahaHyuck* Ya see, all ya needed to do was smile more! You look much better! Maybe if you smile more, you&#39;ll get more kisses from me! *HehehehehehahaHyuck*&quot;<br />
<br />
You scanned the room, hoping to spot something in front of you that you could use if you get out of here. You were done, you were fully sick of it, and damn if you were just going to let them continue this. You had to get out. You just had to. Your body might have said different, but the mere possibility of you being able to move a muscle could manage to get you out of this clown nightmare. You tried to see a open door button, or something where you could defend yourself with it, like an instrument of some sort. Considering how strong certain areas of your body were now, you could use that to your advantage. You kept looking. You kept trying to find something. You have a chance to break out. You had to have one. You couldn&#39;t spend the rest of your life with this new body. You couldn&#39;t spend the rest of your life with these manipulative clown girls. You knew that there was a way out. You couldn&#39;t just be stuck here. You had to find something. But the more you looked, the less you had hope. The possibilities shortened. You hadn&#39;t even begun to think about what else lies among the rest of this clown spaceship. You had little hope. But with what little hope you had, you at least thought that you could still break out of your smiles, your façade that these clowns forced upon you. You still had a chance to tell it how it is to these clowns, especially Amazimanda. You knew that you could break out of the laughter and berate their actions, no matter how many times that they would honk your breasts, nose and bubblebutt. They could change your body, but you knew that they could never change you.<br />
<br />
The thing was...<br />
<br />
...they could...<br />
<br />
...and would.</p>
