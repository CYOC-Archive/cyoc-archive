<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you and Kate approach Chuck&#39;s Eatery she frowns and pauses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; she sighs as she checks her bag. &quot;Sorry babe I forgot two of my textbooks at the college and everyone else has left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you say and hug before she heads off back towards the college. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
You enter the Eatery not noticing anything out of the ordinary. The tables are all neatly set and the servers are just wearing leggings and pale blue t-shirts. You don&#39;t see Zoe anywhere so you go to take a seat when a voice calls out to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay Smith what are you doing here?&quot; Turning you see Professor Stillglass seating alone at a table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I uhh, heard about this place from some other students and wanted to check it out.&quot; you lie not wanting to reveal your actual reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that is nice to hear this place is gaining such a reputation. I like to tryout smaller places like this when I can,&quot; says Mrs. Stillglass and gestures to the spot opposite her. &quot;How about you join me here instead of using up another table?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm sure.&quot; you reply unable to think of a way out of her suggestion and take a seat opposite her.<br />
<br />
A brown haired server with fairly lengthy legs comes other and takes your order. Then you are forced to make small take with one of your professors. Mrs. Stillglass is friendly enough but her to the point and slightly judge-y attitude that she teaches with carries over making it a bit hard to talk openly. You do manage to spot Zoe working and both amazingly and luckily for you she is one of the kitchen staff. She seems normal enough in looks and attitude though you never would have thought she would take up cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here is your food,&quot; the brunette smiles as she sets down the plates. &quot;And these deep fried potato poppers are compliments of the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
On yours is a thick juicy burger that makes your stomach rumble in anticipation. The slightly smaller than golf ball sized poppers also look good, golden brown and smelling inviting savory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get this boxed up to go?&quot; asks Mrs. Stillglass after you both say thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; answers the server then walks off.<br />
<br />
With the food having arrived conversation dies down except for the odd comment now and then. Which happen to be mostly positive comments about the poppers. Though neither you or Mrs. Stillglass notice certain other effects that happen with each one you eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll start with these next time I come here,&quot; said Mrs. Stillglass before depositing her sixth in her mouth. &quot;They are just so tasty!&quot;<br />
<br />
The forty-something professor had started her day reasonable slender dressed in a knee length pencil skirt, a grey blouse and a jacket. Now she resembled a balloon that had been filled with a bit too much air.<br />
<br />
Once visible cheekbones were now concealed by a soft layer of fat that made her usually thin stern face look a bit rounder and cheerier. The tips of her ears gain a point, her nose pushes up just a little while above her butt the start of tail forms. Her jacket now hung on the back of her chair after it began to feel restrictive on her. The top two buttons of her blouse were undone revealing a fair amount of cleavage as her breasts surged up and out of her simple beige bra to the size of grapefruits while the third appeared to be under heavy strain. The bottom of her blouse had fully come untucked thanks to a blooming belly that would have caught a full popper if one had fell and love handles that hung over the waist of her skirt.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which her formerly comfortable loose skirt was now form fittingly tight as it struggled to contain her growing lower assets. A once almost flat rear had become a bountiful head sized booty that she if were walking would have shook with each step. Her thick thighs currently took up every bit of room in the lower part of her skirt having pulled the bottom several inches up from her knees and would make it very interesting once she stood up and tried to walk. Her hips had swollen up as well to round out her now plump figure and cause her considerable distraction as in addition to a flustered feeling overtaking her her enlarged hips were making her panties to ride up and rub against her surprisingly sensitive crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are,&quot; you agree swallowing a bite of burger then take a popper and chomp down on it. The delicious taste of roasted potato seasoned with garlic and other herbs fills your mouth as you chew and add pounds all across your body. Your nose and ears gain a porcine quality to them while your gut grows with each bite of burger or popper till it droops over the top of your pants. Your pants and shirt feel tighter as your limbs gain padding though your pants also feel tighter in not just the legs and waist but around the front as your penis and balls grow larger and excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t tasted anything as good anywhere else I have eaten Mrs. Stillglass.&quot; you add with a grunt before filling your maw with more burger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please call me Julianna,&quot; snorted back Mrs. Stillglass with a smile as she munched on another popper. For some reason she wanted to be as open ass possible with the young man sitting across from her. No just man she thought looking him over he was in college after all as her gaze lingered about his stout build. &quot;Mrs. Stillglass is for when I&#39;m teaching class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, okay Julianna,&quot; you grunt back as you wash down your mouthful of burger with some pop. You grab one of the last remaining poppers and consider if you have room for it for a moment before a belch forces its way out and you put the appetizer in your mouth while your eyes find their way back to Mrs- Julianna&#39;s cleavage. &quot;Oh umm, sorry, excuse me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Its fine,&quot; replies Julianna as she realizes she is staring and wiggles in her chair for a more comfortable position unaware that her ass and thighs have spilled over the edge of it. Doing also unfortunately makes her panties rub more on her moist pussy adding to her need and agitation. Trying to distract herself she notices you staring and where, then to try and appease that need to be sexual she undoes the third button of her blouse. &quot;Just how the body works.&quot;<br />
<br />
A thrill of satisfaction shoots through her as your eyes widen and you stop chewing for a second. A voice in her mind already quieted and clouded by desire and something is pushed away entirely as she ate the second to last popper.<br />
<br />
The most you manage to do in return in nod and snort before swallowing and finishing off your burger. Tearing your eyes, hungry with something else entirely, away from Julianna you focus on the last popper. You reach for it only to find she has done the same. For an instant your and her fingers touch both of you breathing heavy as your eyes meet. The lust you see makes you grunt in irritation as your dick tries to tent your already tight pants. While Julianna leans forward so her elbows are on the table presenting her fat swollen tits for all to see as she also snorts takes in a whiff of a musky smell coming off of you.</p>
