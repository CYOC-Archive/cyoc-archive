<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... what&#39;s got Mr. Science believing in magic?&quot; Nate asked quite curiously.<br />
<br />
Brad glanced from the fish that they had caught and were cooking for breakfast with a slight shrug. The campground they were at was well beyond the area around Lapine Falls, and it would take them a full day to drive back when the did decide to go back. It had been part of a camping trip that he and Nate had planned for the past month. The one thing that got Brad to sigh at the question is that he was not one to believe in magic. He knew Emily liked werewolf movies and was a &quot;fan&quot; of them, but he had only put up with it because he liked her, and since he didn&#39;t think werewolves were real, he saw no real reason get to bent out of shape over Emily&#39;s theories over what they would be like in real life. And Nate knew this. The two of them worked together and Nate also helped him couch the little league teams in Lapine Falls, and thus Nate knew that Brad was very much a believer in what could be scientifically proven. To suddenly express an interest in a magic shop and talk about seriously buying something there sounded weird, even if it was for love.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;d believe me...&quot; Brad said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;I know you like Em and all... but you&#39;ve also stated several times that werewolves are not real and debating what they&#39;d be like was silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad sighed again, and carefully flipped the fish with a small spatula so that the fish didn&#39;t burn and decided to go ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it was actually three days ago, I had to go down to the grocery for some soda and potato chips for the party we had to celebrate the kids&#39; success this year,&quot; Brad began, &quot;and to get there, I had to walk buy that shop that they&#39;d set up. And when I went past it, I did think it was some sort of fantasy/new age health shop for people playing Dungeons and Dragons too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think the kids play that anymore,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;Most of the kids seem to prefer video games these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad only shrugged, &quot;Anyway... they had a big glass window that I could look through and in my curiosity I looked through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See some kid in a costume?&quot; Nate asked teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I actually saw a woman... who looked like she was a kind of eccentric grandmother offering some pink potion in a heart shaped bottle to another woman who looked rather desperate,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Desperate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like she wanted someone to love her real bad,&quot; Brad answered, &quot;and desperate for someone&#39;s attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I take it she downed the potion?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
Brad nodded, &quot;Right there in the shop. She then thanked the &quot;grandma&quot;  and came out... she made it just outside the door when her black jeans and blue blouse turned into a very short pink skirt with a tight pink shirt...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her clothing changed?&quot; Nate gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just &quot;poof&quot; and that wasn&#39;t the end of the issue,&quot; Brad answered, &quot;She stopped and actually looked startled at the change in her clothing, and the fact that her clothing had just changed I was startled enough that I wasn&#39;t able to really go anywhere... She looked at herself for a moment when suddenly her hips flared out and grew wider, making her moan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moan? Like it hurt?&quot; Nate asked as Brad placed the trout that he&#39;d cooked on a plat where there was already some eggs and toast on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, like she was having sex,&quot; Brad answered, &quot;Her hips flared out wider and she seemed to enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad handed Nate his plate and took his own as they headed to a picnic table that was set up for campers to eat at. As he sat down, Brad continued his explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but watch as she ended up bringing her knees together and putting her hands between her legs, pushing her skirt between them,&quot; Brad continued, &quot;Almost like she was trying to get off right there without getting naked and her changes continued all the while...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her changes continued?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, her hair went from an auburn shade to a bleached blond, grew longer and curled at the ends and her lips grew more puffy,&quot; Brad answered, &quot;And she continued to moan as if it was pleasuring her... and then... then her chest began to swell... up and out, her chest went from what was a modest B cup to at least an F cup and the spurts of growth went along with her breaths. The faster she breathed the faster her breasts grew, and that got her to arch her back and compress here growing breasts with her hands as her tight shirt also riffed at the middle of the neck to try and accommodate her new size. Finally once she finally stopped growing she screamed &quot;oh yes&quot; and actually looked to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what did you do?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to apologize for staring, but she actually seemed like she was excited to see me there and began urging we go to a nearby hotel because she &quot;needed&quot; me,&quot; Brad answered, &quot;which was strange because she looked like a normal girl... and took the potion and turned into a... a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bimbo?&quot; Nate supplied him with the word he was looking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Brad answered with a shrug, &quot;anyway, I couldn&#39;t explain that scientifically, so I had to admit that maybe magic is real on some level... and I was figuring that if they&#39;re selling potions that could do that... maybe they&#39;d have something that could let Emily be a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they&#39;re still there tomorrow,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;I went in there on a whim once and they actually move around a lot. They don&#39;t stay in one place for very long.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Emily, however, didn&#39;t need Brad&#39;s help. She&#39;d already been to the shop and bought the enchanted Wolfsbane already. By eating it, she had become a werewolf and found out that her best friend was also a werewolf. And presently Cara stood in front of her in her wolf form. Emily did find herself marveling at Cara&#39;s form, even though her own wolf form was very similar, from the wide hips, a large bust-line, powerful yet still feminine muscles, soft yet strong fur, and the claws on her fingers and toes and the hint of her fangs when she had talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that easy?&quot; Emily asked to Cara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Cara answered slowly and nodding her muzzle, &quot;clearrrr yourrrrrrr mind and think of yourrrrrrrrrrrr wolf forrrrrrrrrrrrrrm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily listened carefully to her friends voice. It was noticeably deeper. Not quite a man&#39;s baritone, but definitely deeper than what most human woman would have, not to mention that Cara&#39;s voice had a noticeable growling edge to it, likely to suit the mixing of her vocal cords between &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;human.&quot; She then sat down and crossed her legs. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure that Cara was right in that willing herself to change would be that easy, but then Cara had been a werewolf for years. She had only just become a werewolf last night on the last night of the full moon. She didn&#39;t feel fully confident in doing it, but then at the same time, maybe Cara&#39;s experience gave her knowledge to know that it was easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm...&quot; Emily gave a low hum and envisioned the form she&#39;d take the night before, seven feet tall, muscles bulging and demonstrating great strength and power, sharp claws and long feet to run swiftly on, D cup breasts to suckle future werewolf pups with and to entice a male werewolf to her, the lupine muzzle with great fangs and the triangular ears, the bushy tail, and the brown fur that covered her. She focused on it and tried to ignore the sound of the grass rustling there and the fact that Cara was standing there in her wolf form. But nothing happened, at least nothing that would indicate that she was going to transform. She felt a little be aroused by the image of her wolf form, but that was about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not working,&quot; Emily said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre focusing on what you look like in yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr wolf forrrrrrrrrrrrrrm,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;Picture not what you look like... but yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr desirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre to be in that forrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrm. You bought the Wolfsbane to become a werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolf, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily nodded, &quot;As I said earlier... because I&#39;ve liked werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cara nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus on yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr desirrrrrrrrrrrrrre to be the wolf,&quot; Cara instructed, &quot;the wish to be a wolf. Not simply what you look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily nodded and took a deep breath and closed her eyes saying, &quot;I want to be a wolf...&quot;<br />
<br />
This time something did happen. Her body began to feel warm as she repeated her mantra of wanting to be in her wolf form. Strangely the image that she saw in her mind was actually the full moon, even though they had passed the last night of the full moon for the month the previous night. Her body grew warm and itched slightly as brown fur began to grow out and cover her body. It didn&#39;t totally hide her nipples or her sexual openings, but her fur would do more than what her naked human skin would.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;rrrrrrrrrrrrrre doing it, Em, keep going!&quot; Cara encouraged her.<br />
<br />
Emily smiled and ran her tongue over her teeth. She could already feeling them starting to sharpen and getting ready to become the fangs she&#39;d have in wolf form. Her claws began to push out from her fingers and toes, and in fact, Emily could feel the claws on her toes starting to dig into the ground underneath her. Her feet also felt slightly uncomfortable and Emily could hear bones snapping and cracking as her feet began to lengthen. Her lengthening feet also helped keep the feeling of her claws digging into the ground underneath her. So far, she hadn&#39;t opened her eyes yet and kept her mental focus on wanting to be in her wolf form. It was hard to not simply reveal in the feelings of her transformation as her lengthening feet rubbed against fur around her knees. At the same time, she also her muscles begin to swell larger, particularly in places where her legs or arms were folded together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Em,&quot; Cara spoke and reached down to take Emily&#39;s clawed paw-like hands in her own, &quot;keep focusing on yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrr desirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre to be a wolf... but let&#39;s get you on yourrrrrrrrrrrrr feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily accepted Cara&#39;s hands and felt herself being pulled up onto her feet. She wavered a little as she tried to get her balance on her now digitigrade feet, but she managed to do so. Then she began feel a throbbing pain at the base of her spine and in her face. In fact it seemed to focus on her face as her enlarging teeth weren&#39;t fitting in her mouth well.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... it... hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth...&quot; Emily gave a pained grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;changing at will can be morrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre painful than durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring the full moon, but as with durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring the full moon... therrrrrrrrrrrrrrre is some release when the change finishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily managed a nod and kept her personal mantra going. She felt that if she opened she&#39;d lose her focus and would go back to human form. Then her face began to push forward. Her skull snapped and crackled as her mouth pushed forward into a very wolf-like muzzle. Her teeth lengthened to their full size as her muzzle grew, and Emily found herself actually giving short pained barks as her face pushed forward and as her ears twitched on the top of her head. The pain was fierce, but it also began to lessen as her muzzle finished growing. In fact Amy also began to feel her &quot;human hair,&quot; which had grown longer and more wild begin to tickle the fur on her backside and particularly a nub at the base of her spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre doing grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat, Em,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;Keep going. You can do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Emily stated, not a question as she felt her tail begin to push out from being a little nub, &quot;I can do it...&quot; And she then vocally said her mantra again as her tail grew out behind her, and as her breasts swelled up to a D cup to complete her transformation. &quot;I... WANT... TO... BE... A... WOLF!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then with a final snap, Emily felt her tail finished growing as she began wagging it and gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did it,&quot; Emily smiled as she finally opened her eyes to see Cara smiling at her as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes you did,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;and now we need to get back home...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back home?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where we can get drrrrrrrrrrrrrressed,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;and make an appointment at the salon. And we must be quick... most people will still be asleep, but we can&#39;t waste time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily then nodded and began to jog back toward Lapine Falls, and soon found herself running on all fours with Cara beside her. The two of them traded smiles. She wondered how she&#39;d tell Brad about this, but that could wait, as for now, she and Cara were a pack.</p>
