<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that night you wake to the sounds of an argument in the living room.  You guess it's about 2 am or so, but you're not sure because there is nothing in your room that indicates time.<br />
<br />
You get up, still in just your boxers, and open you're bedroom door and peek through the slight crack.<br />
<br />
Damon is surrounded by four very large hairy bikers with full beards, tattoos and hairy arms that ripple with muscle.<br />
<br />
You didn't catch much of what was being said, but it sounds like Damon owes them money.  You grin as the 'tough guy' pleads for more time.  You guess that Damon is being paid to keep you and change you into a white trash ghetto punk, but he's not getting much money or if he is, he's not paying these guys off with it.<br />
<br />
The talking becomes angry and suddenly the bikers start beating the shit out of Damon.  You turn away and then look back because your morbid curiosity is getting the better of you.<br />
<br />
The four bikers work Damon over really well and then each in turn unzip their pants and piss on him.  Their leader, puffing on a huge cigar brings the cherry to a bright orange glow and then stabs it into Damon's forehead.<br />
<br />
Damon lets out a strangled scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better come up with our money by next week or I'll fuckin' cut your guts out and feed them to you as you die.&quot;  The leader says.<br />
<br />
He turns to the other three and says, &quot;Search the place, he's gotta have money or something around here somewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon shoots a quick look over in your direction and sees you peeking through the door.  He gives you a subtle facial expression, his face looking very worried, and you know he means for you to hide.<br />
<br />
You shut the door as quietly as possible and look about your room for a hiding place.  Due to Damon's spartan furnishings, you don't have much in the way of options.  Hell, the light bulb even burned out and Damon didn't bother to replace it and of course, you can't get out the window because Damon had it barred.  The only option is the closet... the empty closet.  You make your way to the closet and crouch down in the far corner.  If anyone were to move the broken down sliding door, they would see you immediately.  You hope that doesn't happen and yet another part of you does.  Part of you realizes that these bikers might be your ticket to freedom.  Perhaps you could get away and tell the police.  You hear the bikers ransacking the dingy apartment and finally they open the door to your room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like there's nothin' but a ‘fuck mattress’ in here.&quot; one of the bikers growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look anyway Wolf; he might have hidden something in the mattress.&quot;  You hear the leader say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man!  I don't want to tear apart some crab infested, cum stained old mattress.  God knows what disease I could get from that fuckin' jiz sponge, Grizz!&quot;  Wolf says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just fuckin' do it ya fuckin' prissy asshole!&quot;  You hear what sounds like a sound kick and Damon's yelp and moan and an evil chuckle from the guy Wolf identified as Grizz.  You guess that someone probably kicked Damon in the ribs or head or something.<br />
<br />
You're scared as Hell and trembling all over.  You hear Wolf ripping apart your mattress with a knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;There ain't fuckin' nothin' in here Grizz!  It's just a mattress.  Looks like the fucker had his son here though, there's some jeans, a couple of porn mags and a wife beater that looks like it would fit a kid.&quot;  Wolf yells back.<br />
<br />
Wolf moves closer to your hiding place.  Thank God it's so dark.  The door is pushed aside and you look up into the face of the large black bearded biker that was tearing apart your room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!  What the fuck do we have here?&quot;  Wolf says loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did you find bro?&quot;  You hear the leader say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come and have a look for yourself, you ain't gonna believe this!&quot;  Wolf says.<br />
<br />
He looks at you and offers you his hand and says softly, &quot;Come on, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having no other choice, you take his hand and he hauls you up into the standing position as the leader enters the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like Damon's was fuckin' baby rapin’ and abusin' this kid, Grizz.&quot;  Wolf says over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that true kid?&quot;  Grizz says, puffing on his cigar.<br />
<br />
Damon yells from the other room, &quot;I ain't no fuckin' fag!  That's my cousin; he's stayin' here 'cause his mom's a crack ho.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't yank your fuckin' chain you dick-munchin’ ass fuckin’ motherfucker!&quot;  Grizz yells back at Damon and he groans again after one of the other bikers kicks him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked you kid, is that fucker rapin' you?&quot;, Grizz growls.<br />
<br />
You realize you hold power over Damon's life.  These men would probably kill Damon if you told them he was a fag.  You also know that Damon, rough as he is, doesn’t deserve death.  He’s been fair with you, it’s your stepfather who has betrayed you and forced this on you.<br />
<br />
“No.” You say.  “Damon hasn’t done anything to me.  He kidnapped me from my home and is plotting with my stepfather to make me into some sort of ghetto punk, but he hasn’t fucked me or made me do anything with him.”<br />
<br />
“You’re cousin?”  Grizz yells back over his shoulder.  “You lyin’ sack of shit!  I should beat the fuckin’ crap out of you for that but I’ll let it slide ‘cause it would take too long and I got an idea about this kid.”<br />
<br />
You realize with what you’ve just said that you will have your revenge on your stepfather and Damon at the same time, if these bikers take you.  Hell, you always sorta admired bikers anyway because of the time some of them scared the crap out of your step-dad when a group of them passed him on the road on their Hawgs, taunting him in his Porsche.  If your step-dad wants to make a man out of you, you’d rather be this kind of man than some ghetto punk.<br />
<br />
“Is that so?  Your ol’ man rich kid?”  Grizz says slyly.<br />
<br />
“Yes and he’s paying Damon to make a man out of me.  At least that’s what Damon said on the phone the other day.”  You answer.<br />
<br />
With that Wolf and Grizz exchange a glance, grin.  <br />
<br />
“Any idea how much, kid?” Grizz asks.  You shake your head no.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s go ask Mr. Wizard in there and see if he knows.” and with that they usher you into the front room.<br />
<br />
Grizz talks to the other two bikers as he enters the living room.  “Billy, tie this ‘gangsta’ fucker up so he can’t follow us when we take the kid.”  Your heart races as you realize that you’re leaving this place.  It’s exciting and scary, because you realize that you could be going from the frying pan into the fire.  “Snake, go and get the truck.  Damon, the kid here says you’re makin’ a man outa him for his rich ol’ man?  I tell you what I’m gonna do.  I’m gonna take him off your hands and take over this ‘manhood training’ for his ol’ man.  I’m a fair man, I’ll cut what you owe me in half for the kid, all you gotta do is tell me how much you’re gettin’ for him and give me his ol’ man’s phone number.  If you don’t do that, and do it now, I’ll feed you your guts tonight.”  Grizz says in a soft and extremely calm, polite way that sends chills down your spine.<br />
<br />
Damon is wide eyed.  Obviously truly intimidated by Grizz.<br />
<br />
“I’m getting’ fifty ‘g’s for him, plus expenses.”  Damon says.<br />
<br />
“Good!  Now see, we can be real civilized about this shit, can’t we.  No need to act like animals, is there?  Which button on this phone of yours hooks me up with the kid’s dad?”  Grizz says.<br />
<br />
“Hit pound 55.”  Damon says.<br />
<br />
In a short while Grizz has renegotiated the terms of your training with your stepfather.  He’s demanded 75 grand plus expenses and didn’t meet with any argument.  Your stepfather has agreed to turn over your training to these bikers because in the end, he has no other choice.  Grizz assures him that you will receive all the same hormone treatments and exercise regimens Damon would have supplied with the added bonus that you will be taught how to fight and fix, ride and repair everything from a Harley to a semi truck.  Grizz assures your father that when you are returned to him in five years, you will be the toughest meanest bro on the road next to him, of course.<br />
<br />
He hangs up and tells you to get dressed.  You put on the clothes Damon gave you and return to the living room.  Snake comes in and tells Grizz that the truck is waiting.<br />
<br />
Grizz says to a tied up Damon as you leave the apartment, “Remember, a full payment next week or I gut you.  Snake here’s gonna stay behind to make sure you don’t get help, he’ll cut through most of the ties before he leaves.”<br />
<br />
Grizz takes you down the stairs and puts you in the truck.  It’s an old beat up Chevy crew cab pickup.  Grizz tells you to get into the back seat and lie down.  You do as you’re told.  Wolf and Billy get on their bikes and head out.  Grizz lights up another cigar and follows.<br />
<br />
About an hour after leaving, Snake cuts through most of Damon’s bonds and leaves on Grizz’ Harley.<br />
<br />
Four hours later you wake up when the truck comes to a stop in some little town out in the middle of nowhere.  It’s pretty country; slightly mountainous and lots of trees.  There’s a big ranch type house with about 15 to 20 motorcycles parked around it and you hear old AC/DC coming from the house.  There are rough looking hairy bikers, some skinny, some fat, all bearded or with big bushy moustaches just hanging out on old couches or chairs on the porch.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to your new home.”  Grizz says, “I bet you’re hungry.  I’ll see what my ol’ lady can fix up for us.  You like steak and eggs, don’t cha boy?”<br />
<br />
Your mouth watering at the thought of meat, you agree with enthusiasm as you get out of the truck and follow Grizz into the house.</p>
