<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll get a shower and be all changed.&quot; With that, Alex hung up and headed to his room. Little did he know that his last statement would change his life forever, though he wouldn&#39;t be aware of it.<br />
<br />
After tossing aside his football gear, Alex headed to the bathroom, stripped, and tossed his sweaty clothes into the hamper.  He started to take off the ring, as well, but something mentally stopped him.  Almost subconciously, he then looked at himself in the mirror, noting his sweaty and lightly dirty appearance, his hair messy with a light curl up front.  &quot;Yeah, I probably do smell like a dirty pig.&quot;  And then, without thinking about it, he also added, &quot;but I look like a pig&#39;s ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, he blinked.  And that was all the time that was needed for his reality to warp itself, for when his eyes opened back up, he found himself on the floor, in front of a full-length mirror that now stood beside the sink.  In the mirror&#39;s refection, he found himself face-to-face with a pig&#39;s rear end, covered with white hair, save for the familiar black hair covering the curly tail up top.  Most striking, though, was the pair of human eyes surrounding the buttcrack.  Alex blinked again with those eyes.  Nope, nothing unusual about this.<br />
<br />
With a thought, Alex felt his body move and turn, revealing the rest of the pig in the reflection, covered with the same white hair (not from age, mind you), and complete with a functional pig&#39;s head in front.  Zander was his name.  Alex and he shared a mental link with each other, allowing them to communicate with each other; not with words, but with mere thoughts.  Just now, for example, Zander sensed that Alex wanted him to turn more towards the mirror, allowing Alex to view the body behind him.  Zander had a free will of his own, of course.  In fact, outside of the movement of Alex&#39;s own eyes, Zander had complete control over his body as the host.  It would not be unusual for Alex to sometimes find himself along for the ride while Zander played with the dog.  Thankfully, Zander had an understanding and respect for his sentient behind.  He was also smarter than the average pig, thanks perhaps to the mental link with Alex&#39;s human mind.  Able to understand speech, but not quite mentally capable of speaking, himself.  And given that Alex&#39;s &quot;mouth&quot; was simply a pig&#39;s anus, this admittedly left communication with others rather difficult.<br />
<br />
All things considered, though, Alex was happy living as a pig&#39;s butt.  (Granted, it was the only life he knew.)  And despite the two being 17 years old, it seemed he had plenty more years of this life ahead of him.  He had a friendly co-existance with his body mate; and as far as pig butts go, he thought he looked good.  A shame none of the girls at school seemed to find him attractive.<br />
<br />
That said, attractive though he was, he was currently a DIRTY pig&#39;s butt, having just come home from football practice.  Alex gave Zander a mental instruction to get cleaned up, and he watched the mirror get furthur away as Zander trotted toward the shower stall.  Along the way, Alex heard the light &quot;tink&quot; of the ring he found falling off Zander&#39;s left rear hoof.  Alex had almost forgotten they found the ring earlier.  It was clearly meant for human fingers, but it was impressive how long it stayed on him and Zander.  Meanwhile, Zander continued forward, having failed to notice the ring falling off.  For the moment, Alex decided it wasn&#39;t worth instructing Zander to turn back for it.  (Not that it mattered.  Even if Alex and Zander were aware of the ring&#39;s powers, those powers can only activate with speech.)<br />
<br />
The shower had been rigged to allow Zander to clean himself.  Pushing the swinging glass door closed with his snout, he then stood up against the wall and did the same with the wide water handles.  In back, Alex couldn&#39;t see what Zander was doing, but he could feel the movement of their shared body, and hear through Zander&#39;s ears.  Suddenly, he felt water on their back.<br />
<br />
Zander then turned pushed a button on the wall, and soap was mixed in with the water.  Next, Zander pulled at a rubber rope with his mouth, swinging out a plastic rod with a scrubber brush attached to it.  The brush extended from the end of the rod toward the wall, and continued down the wall.  Zander trotted into it, using it to scrub his back and sides, going through both ways to ensure he scrubbed himself as much as he could.  Alex enjoyed this aspect of life, even as Zander turned to brush Alex&#39;s face across the brush.  It was technically his body doing the moving, but it almost felt like being pampered.  Even when Alex was a piglett tush, he had enjoyed bath time.<br />
<br />
As Zander finished, he pushed the button on the shower wall again, turning off the soap.  As soon as Zander finished rinsing off, he turned off the shower, and then pulled at another rubber rope, this time to swing the shower door back open.  Alex watched from behind as he was as led out of the shower stall, before watching the world turn upside-down, as Zander rolled across a large towel on the floor to dry off.<br />
<br />
On their way out of the bathroom, Alex mentally instructed for Zander to grab the ring, and Zander did so, holding it in his mouth.  The ring might not fit them, but maybe their mom would like it.  Speaking of whom, there was still another ten minutes before she got home to pick them up for their aunt&#39;s wedding.  For now, Alex decided to leave Zander to his whims.  And it didn&#39;t take long to find out what those whims were, as he heard the barking of their dog, and the scenery of house began zipping past him.</p>
