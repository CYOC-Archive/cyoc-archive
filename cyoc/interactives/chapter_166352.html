<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up with a jump, clutching your nose. Or at least you would have been if not for Sasha pinning down you and your arms under her, as she straddled your body. You can hardly see with the tears in your eyes. The pain in your nose wasn&#39;t that bad, but it made your eyes water a lot.<br />
<br />
Your felt an unknown weight pulling on your nose, whatever it was was not big enough to cover your lips. Seeing Sasha&#39;s expression after she cleared your tears for you, you were somehow immediately calmed. She had a very proud smile on her face, apparently pleased with or about something. Just seeing her full of confidence was enough to reassure you that everything was ok. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl at keeping yoursel under control. You are just the one I have been looking for, sweetheart. A cute girl who is unquestionably submissive to me, and me alone. A cute girl who is ready to accept anything I give to her, right?&quot; Sasha explains while leaning in close to your face. You dont know if you felt more afraid or more turned on, but she was beginning to make you feel uneasy. <br />
<br />
However her entire expression soon fell apart, and she began smerking, which became giggling, and ended wirh her hopping off of you and helping you get up onto your still high heeled feet. Finally giving you a loving hug, laying your head onto her chest. &quot;Sorry to scare you sweetheart&quot;. She appologeticly said. I know how much it hurts initially, so I figured if you were asleep it would lessen it a bit, which it successfully did for a while. <br />
<br />
Picking up your head, you look up into her eyes, at which she leans in and kisses your forehead. &quot;All better?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod slowly. Still not fully sure what exactly was going on. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you like it? I was given it the other day as a gift from the club. And I felt that it would look perfect on you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;W-what exactly is it?&quot; You cautiously ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You still dont know? Here go look in the mirror.&quot; She said as she grabbed your hand and pulled you over in front of the full wall mirror. <br />
<br />
You eyes immediately identify what it was. Your nose had been pierced, and a very familiar looking ring had been inserted into it, similarly to how a cow has. You didn&#39;t really like nose rings in your previous life, but now you found the accessory beautiful. &quot;Its beautiful, I love it.&quot; You beamed, moving closer to the mirror to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you love it, because it is kinda permanent.&quot; Sasha said quietly. You heard her, but didn&#39;t care. You had no intention of removing it anyways. You even loved how it slightly raised up the tip of your nose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as I said earlier, you are now my official secretary, although that is just a title. Your position is actually closer to being my sex toy/ submissive girlfriend. You will still be paid the same, but won&#39;t actually need to bother with office work. Just accompanying me to work and letting me play around with you durring the day is more than enough. But if you want, I don&#39;t mind you becomming my real girlfriend. I may be dominant, but I am not a sadist, so I wont purposely harm you without reason or torture you for only my enjoyment, well ignoring the piercing,  but that was a one time thing. I know just how much fun I can have with you from last night, and you seemed to be enjoying it as well. So, what do you say sweetheart?&quot;<br />
<br />
You had already know there was no turning back for you since you put on the heels. Plus there was no downside at all for you in this. Sure you were basically agreeing to becomming her pet girlfriend, but that was what made it even better in your mind. You were about to agree when an idea popped into your head. <br />
<br />
You dropped to your knees, suddenly thinking how glad you were that you hadnt had the horsecock still in you, but instead your tail. You completely forgot to even check, not trusting your body to feel it anymore since you no longer could tell you were still in heels by feeling anymore.  You pushed your face practically into Sasha&#39;s pussy, licking it happily, you tail once again displaying how happy you actually were.<br />
<br />
However, Sasha hooked a finger into your ring and pulled you off of her. You were surprised that it didnt hurt at all to be yanked by your nose ring. Confused, you look up at Sasha. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will take that as your full acceptance of my proposal, but when did I give you permission to start licking my pussy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it normal for a girl to want to make her wife feel good when she is also happy?&quot; You answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wife? W-w-what are you saying?&quot; Sasha suddenly flustered started to studder out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just said that you accepted me accepting your proposal, and even gave me a ring while on your knees and everything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;T-t-those are two very different things. We just met yesterday afterall. At least get to know me before. What if you dont like me as much as you think? I-I can be weird sometimes. Plus I&#39;m an awkward 6&#39;-5&quot; tall, and that is without heels. And I am clingly when I get tired, so I will almost certainly be all over you when I am sleeping. And I usually tend to go overboard with sex since I am too self conscious to just do it normally. I would definitely try and embarras you in public once I start taking it too far. A-and I am hooked on artificial semen. I drink at least a tube a day... And I... And I... &quot; Sasha said, now beginning to hyperventilate from a panic attack. <br />
<br />
You move closer to her and hug her, gently resting your head on her boobs as you look up at her face, trying your best to look cute. After a minute she finally calmed a bit, and was breathing normally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t look at me like that, it isnt fair.&quot; Sasha said turning her head away, but still stole an occasional glance. You just continued to look at her while your head was resting in her boobs. Your tail flicking back and firth playfully. &quot;Why do you even want to be my wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was your turn to embarrassingly explain yourself. &quot;Well, I was just joking around. Not that I would ever be against marrying you, in fact I would be happy to, but the timing was too good to pass up. Sorry. And while I am at it, I actually, kind of, like just... just about everything you just listed. Though I admit that I don&#39;t actually know what artificial semen is. So I can&#39;t say it bothers me. But sorry. &quot; You meakly admit. <br />
<br />
You could tell even with your eyes closed. She was mad. Though mostly just embarrassed. &quot;I hate you&quot; she murdered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;mmmm Sorrrrrrrrryyyyyyyy&quot; you cried, while over embellishing the sadness in the tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really?&quot; Sasha said, now pushing her fake anger act a bit more by pouting.<br />
<br />
You nod, but in a way that just sank your head further into her cleavage. While doing so, you felt her begin to grope your naked ass, causing you to moan a bit into her tits, which in tern made them shake a bit from the vibrations. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, if you really are sorry, I know how you can make it up to me.&quot; Sasha said, now gently petting your head with her right hand, and squeezing your ass a bit harder with the left. Of course this made you moan even more, which then cause her tits to vibrate more.</p>
