<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, Suzzy,&quot; Edwin began, still not used to looking up at his old body just yet, not to mention he hadn&#39;t quite gotten used to having this new body either, especially the feeling of having a vagina, much less a pre-pubescent one. &quot;We don&#39;t have to wear each other&#39;s bodies the entire time, only when I need to rehearse, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay...&quot; Suzzy let out, a frown appearing on her face as she looked down at him. Edwin&#39;s hands began to trace circles on his pants in a rather childish way, something Edwin thought he&#39;d never experience his body doing. Feeling sad about Suzy&#39;s own sadness, (Must&#39;ve been those new pre-pubescent hormones) Edwin felt tears building up in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Edwin said to himself, rubbing Suzzy&#39;s hands against his eyes, noticing how soft they still felt. Collecting himself, he looked up at Suzzy again, getting an idea as to how to make her feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, would you like to watch the play practice?&quot; He offered, causing the second-grader to perk up, her face becoming elated. &quot;I know you&#39;re not old enough to help out, but it couldn&#39;t hurt to watch, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Suzzy said excitedly, clasping her hands together, yet another thing Edwin figured he&#39;d never see his body do. &quot;I&#39;d love to watch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Edwin said, pleased that Suzzy was feeling better, in turn making him feel better as well. He sure hoped that this body wasn&#39;t getting to him too quickly... &quot;Should we swap back now? I only really need your body for the rehearsals.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Suzzy said, taking her head off of Edwin&#39;s body, holding it in her hands. &quot;Here you go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just let me take my head off first...&quot; Edwin said, bringing Suzzy&#39;s softer hands to his head, attempting to pull it off. To his surprise, it didn&#39;t budge. Eyes widening, Edwin figured that he must&#39;ve imagined the unfamiliar sensation and tried once more. Once he felt it not budge either, Edwin began to panic, the reality of being stuck on a child&#39;s body setting in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; Suzzy asked, her head still in her hands as Edwin&#39;s body continued to tower over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I can&#39;t take my head off!&quot; Edwin said, tears beginning to form in his eyes. &quot;It&#39;s stuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Suzzy exclaimed, eyes widening as well.<br />
<br />
The events that followed were rather hectic for Edwin&#39;s liking, furthering his nightmare. First, they had to go to the principal, seeing as they couldn&#39;t undo this mess by themselves. The principal seemed to be more sympathetic to Suzzy&#39;s plight, but came down hard on Edwin, much to the boy&#39;s dismay. It wasn&#39;t like there were any rules about not swapping with a child, but the principal mainly seemed upset to break his &quot;no body-swapping incident&quot; streak, something most schools were required to have. After calling in the nurse, they both tried to get Edwin&#39;s head off of Suzzy&#39;s body, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
The principal then proceeded to inform both Suzzy&#39;s and Edwin&#39;s parents of the events that had occurred, making sure to emphasize the fact that Edwin would be serving detention for his actions. Next, Dawn and Suzzy&#39;s older brother, who just to be Edwin&#39;s best friend, Sammy, were both called in and informed. All parties were in for surprise, however, as when Dawn and Sammy entered, it appeared that they had swapped heads as well, for Dawn&#39;s role in the play.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, both Sammy and Edwin had some issues with the other swapping bodies with their younger sister, but seeing as both of them did it, they simply had a silent mutual understanding. Sammy did find it weird as Suzzy was now nearly as tall as him, but took solace in the fact that Suzzy seemed to be handling this just fine. For her part, Dawn did her best to help Edwin cope, knowing that something like this was exactly why he had his aversions to body swapping with a girl. (She could definitely save her teasings for later.)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Sammy and Dawn both were informed that, at least during school hours, they would take care of thei respective siblings. After this, there was one last thing to do; call Ms. Hernandez to the office. To say that she was eccentric was... an understatement. As soon as she came in, she immediately figured out what was going on, being the intelligent woman she was. But instead of addressing the problem, she instead began cooing over how cute Suzzy&#39;s body was, applauding Edwin for taking the initiative to get the body of a child.<br />
<br />
The principal wasn&#39;t pleased with her behavior, but Ms. Hernandez wouldn&#39;t have it. And after hearing that Edwin was to serve lunch detention after scoring the lead in her play, she went ballistic. After haggling, she won Edwin&#39;s right to come to practice both during lunch and after school, with the punishment being that Edwin would simply serve recess detention.<br />
<br />
With all that done and settled with, everyone was sent out of the office and subsequently sent home, seeing as it was the end of the day, leaving the principal to make an annoyed call to a body-swapping specialist. The walk home was quick, but much more exhausting than Edwin remembered, probably because of his shorter legs, not to mention his pink tutu constantly flopping against his body. Upon arriving home, Edwin had to present his new self to his parents.<br />
<br />
They were understanding for the most part, although Edwin&#39;s mom was confused as to why no girl would want to swap bodies with her &quot;handsome baby boy&quot;. (making Edwin blush a deep red) Still, they did admit that it was strange that Edwin&#39;s head wouldn&#39;t come off, and allowed Dawn to take Edwin up to his room. <br />
<br />
All that being done, Edwin flopped onto his bed as soon as he was in his room, letting out a sigh. &quot;This sucks... and the worst part is my head is probably gonna change soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, sis- I mean bro!&quot; Dawn said, slipping up, now back in her old body. To prevent changes to her head, she had swapped back with Sammy during the walk home. Sammy had planned to keep Suzzy&#39;s head off of Edwin&#39;s body while she was asleep, making sure no changes would happen to her either. &quot;It&#39;ll probably take some time before that happens, and by then, I&#39;m sure the specialist will have fixed things!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dawn...&quot; Edwin said, giving his now big sister a grateful smile. &quot;I&#39;m glad I have a sister like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dawn blushed profusely at that, stammering out a half baked insult and running out of the room, leaving Edwin to his lonesome. Edwin couldn&#39;t help but smile at her behavior; despite her teasing, she was a softy deep down. Still, he certainly hoped this mess would be fixed soon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Till then,&quot; Edwin murmured, looking over his body. &quot;I should probably sleep with my clothes on...&quot;</p>
