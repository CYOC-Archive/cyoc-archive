<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Barbara and Coyote walked out of the bar and walked the narrow and steep streets of <br />
San Francisco the elder animal spirit spoke to the former concubine of the prince of the <br />
fennec kitsune,  &quot;Ya know it'sa pity.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What's a pity?&quot; Barbara asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean with the wool being pulled off of all the mortal eyes. It kinda derails what I <br />
normally do for a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a fact?&quot; Barbara raised an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! Yip! Normally on a date I'd go to the local park, reality warp a couple old ladies into <br />
otter boys in swim trunks, and of course there was no shortage of gang members spraying <br />
their graffiti to reality warp into little girls having a tea party. And of course reality warp <br />
the random swimmer into a mermaid! But now, meh!  Now that everyone knows magic <br />
exists, and that the creatures of their dreams and nightmares are real, I feel like I've been <br />
robbed of my play-dough!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, you could just find some people -willing- to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice idea but still meh!  Whao! Whao! Whao! Don't give me that look gorgeous! It doesn't <br />
look like on a pretty vixen like you! Yeah, yeah I know the story behind you sweetie, <br />
kitsune and yours truly have something of a business relationship. Look, it's not like I'd be <br />
out to turn them into slaves or robots! Well, there was that one anime convention and this <br />
lass who wanted to win the cosplay event with her Chaobits costume but that's besides the <br />
point!&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara remember the times when she had been Karther's doll Anne (now Akane/Akira) <br />
had chatted ideally about some of the animes she knew (even as a zombified fox sex slave <br />
she was still an otaku). <br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that by turning her INTO a chaobit, she was no longer technically in <br />
costume right and therefore cheating?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;I saw that episode of Simpsons too! I didn't mind my cameo! The point is that I'm not out <br />
to conquer the world or -torture- anybody! I just want to have some fun and games! And <br />
now that 'memory charms' have gone the way of the cat-o-nine-tails, and humans no <br />
longer can look at something supernatural and just tell themselves 'that doesn't exist so it <br />
can't exist' I feel like I've lost my main source of fun!  I've reality warped green activists <br />
into dryads, trolls into truck drivers, I even once reality wrapped this little boy's pet dog <br />
into his little brother. The CHARM for me is the obviousness! The way I could change <br />
whatever I wanted as long it didn't result in murder and just watch the mortals go about <br />
their business without a clue that things had been different before hand.  But now, the <br />
divine all signed an universal agreement now that the wool is gone, we absolute chaos <br />
types aren't allowed to rewrite the space time continuum on a whim anymore! And above <br />
all we're not allowed to rewrite the memories of everyone and their grandma anymore! It <br />
ruins the ability for me to keep the thrill fresh! It's just not right I tell you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My heart bleeds.&quot; Barbara said dryly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I can understand your cold reception to that given how the punk brat royally <br />
screwed ya over.... okay, I DO apologize for that one. But the point is babe, your my first <br />
date since the walls came down, and I can't do what I normally do ask you who you like or <br />
dislike and reality warp them into whatever species you find fitting anymore...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I've gotten from the news that my sisters kicked Karther's butt and a new kitsune <br />
who seems a lot saner fennec is on the throne. And compared to THAT, anyone else I <br />
hated before just seems petty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do petty.&quot; Coyote said -almost- (but never completely) meekly. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't want to. And after havin' my DNA screwed without my permission, I'd rather <br />
not drop that on anyone, I don't suppose you could just ASK someone for what they want, <br />
and use the old 'who really knows what they want' motif to watch them get a taste of <br />
reality and get your trill off of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm... actually did one or two of those... about half beg me to change them back <br />
after about a time of the month... but it just doesn't feel the same!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE!&quot; A man in dirty clothes reeking of booze pointed a rusted <br />
cutting knife at the elder animal spirit and fox woman. He had jumped out of the alleyway <br />
when the pair had walked onto a less traveled by street.<br />
<br />
Coyote snapped his fingers and the mugger lost twenty years of life, his Y chromosome, <br />
and his high school drop out education. The little girl in the pretty dress blinked a couple <br />
of time confused before smiling at the two and held out a basket, &quot;Help starvin' families in <br />
Arfica?&quot; <br />
<br />
Barbara stared and as if in a dream put a dollar coin in basket, the girl curtsied and <br />
skipped off onto a grade-school bus. <br />
<br />
Barbara stared at Coyote, &quot;You... but you said...&quot;<br />
<br />
Coyote held up his hands, &quot;Self defense babe, well, defense of you, totally different rules <br />
apply. And it's not like I erased his -existence-! I just made him be born a couple decades <br />
later, changed one part of his DNA sequence, and made it so her parent will spank her <br />
when she needed to be spanked and hugged when she needs to be hugged. Besides, his <br />
fate thread had that he was gonna die in a fight over some thick liquor within two years, <br />
now as things stand she dies of a heart attack in her fifties due to a genetic disorder she'll <br />
never know she has after writing two children's books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... If you can do all that...and mess with her DNA in the first place... why not undo that <br />
disorder while you're at it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, what would be the POINT of her life if I fixed ALL her problems FOR her?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... You didn't bring us down this street in -particular- so you could do that did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, as much as I'd love to take credit for that, and just to see you go crazy figuring out <br />
weather I did or not, that guy wasn't part of my scheme.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don't have everything worked out perfectly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm -Chaos- girlie, if I could figure out everything perfectly, it would kinda miss the <br />
point. Say... as long as we're on the subject... how you'd like to be a shaved monkey again <br />
with the ability to produce sperm? I know you don't care for the shallow types that have <br />
been floatin' your way ever since you got back home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You think I'm crazy enough to accept a gift from -you?-&quot; 'And I told that fennec boy that <br />
I'd -think- about it.'<br />
<br />
&quot;You... are a very smart lady, heh, I must be cursed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Figured that since I used to be a he that I'd wouldn't poke at your weak point?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very VERY smart lady... heheheh. So, since I can't take you on a safari of reality warping, <br />
what do YOU suggest we do for an evening together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to find a way to ironically twist any suggestion I give right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; Coyote said without shame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then! Let's go all out then, how about a dance on the rings of Saturn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coyote stared for one second then burst out laughing, making many many people look at <br />
him having long left the secluded street behind.  &quot;Babe! I like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Coyote grabbed Barbara's hand, and in a moment they were in her apartment's bed room. <br />
Before Barbara could ask Coyote pushed on Barbara's forehead... it almost felt like his <br />
fingers were pushing into her brain yet somehow still pushing on her forehead. Coyote <br />
then said, &quot;Turn around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbara did so and gasped when she saw herself on the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry babe, you're not dead, you're just having an out of body experience, your <br />
meat sack home stead is still alive and will remain alive unless you spend so long away <br />
from it it starves to death or the like or someone sets the building on fire to collect <br />
insurance or a burglar comes in here or the like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a lovely thought...&quot; Barbara said knowing she'd feel sick right now if she had a <br />
stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it sweetie.&quot; Coyote snapped out his fingers and he was no longer a <br />
solid manifestation. &quot;If you do accidently die, I'll see about you becoming an elder spirit of <br />
chaos like me! Of course your spiritual projection would need some upgrades, but meh, <br />
like I said, 'if'. So, ya said you wanted to dance on the rings of Saturn right? Let's dance <br />
baby!&quot; <br />
<br />
Coyote and Barbara spent the next several hours dancing on the rights of saturn, visible <br />
manifestations, by pure and -honest- chance for once there were no man made space <br />
telescope shots of the event (pity since Barbara would have wanted a copy), a flying saucer <br />
did happen by, the crew took one look at what they saw. The ETs decided they must all be <br />
suffering mentally from too much stress, then they check their equipment, and decided <br />
their scanners must have all been suffering a serious malfunction, and FLED to the nearest <br />
outpost of their species for a total overhaul of their ship and several cycles worth of clearly <br />
overdue vacation time! Coyote's laugh echoed in their hearing holes.</p>
