<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9:30 AM--Lateisha and John work out what to do with the rings <br />
<br />
If Lateisha had been Naomi, that would have been that. But she wasn't. And Katie worked up the nerve to have her say. Still assigned to work security with the deer, she didn't yet go back into 'ninja mode' vanishing from plain sight, but instead politely waited for a chance to speak with Lateisha when she had finished speaking details with John. Who indeed, look distraught over this new set of details, and had quickly gone to speak with the good father about them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Lateisha. I'm sorry I went over your heads.&quot; Katie said politely bowing her head to Latteisha, &quot;I never intended to cause trouble. And you're right, I should have thought of this sooner.&quot; She raised her head slightly, &quot;But, you're wrong if you think I don't have any respect for what goes on here. I likely have a lot more respect for what goes on her than most of the Managers! I work with you people day in and day out, I think about what makes me human every day. And I wonder what makes you human too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the people in this park don't consider themselves human.&quot; Lateisha said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Depends I guess if you consider human a species or a term. The point is, I gave you those rings, because I did care about this wedding. And, and I wanted to do something for you people like Harry did!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry?&quot; Lateisha asked. <br />
<br />
Katie caught herself, &quot;He's the husky who, who thought up giving you the flowers to use for the brides. The Managers had  nothing to do with it. You may not believe it, but we huskies, or at least the ones I'm friends with, care about you and every other guest here.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Look, I get it, your intentions were good, and you weren't trying to show off. You just need to think more before you act.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie laugh and placed her muzzle in her paw. She really was spending too much time with Harry.  &quot;So where's the bearer of the rings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Gandulf' is giving him a run through of what he needs to do right after he gets back from talking with Father Tyminski.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
9:40 AM--Father Tyminski<br />
<br />
The raccoon priest, standing still as the artistic illustrations were applied to his fur by his friend, listened calmly to John's news and simply said, &quot;Good.&quot; <br />
<br />
John started. &quot;Good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; The raccoon priest said, his arms point out to his sides as he continued to hold still. <br />
<br />
John stared. &quot;Some husky waltz in, and throws a wrench into the mix, and you just say good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it going to rain today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not according to our wether man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bride or groom having second thought?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I know of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I don't see what the problem is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is that I know have to work an entire new bit into the ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's actually more like working something back in. The rings are tradition in western culture after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but... I just mean, I didn't see this coming!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to life. And from what you say, I take it you're going to include it after all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well... the husky already got Spike excited, and...&quot; John thought about it. &quot;It would feel wrong to tell Boss Man Jeremy and Boss Lady Leticia that they missed out on having rings because I couldn't work it in.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;All this truly means is the ceremony will last a few minutes longer. Just make sure that the bride and groom know ahead of time if you feel it's best they not be surprised by having rings after all, and everything will be alright.&quot; <br />
<br />
John just shook his head, but seriously, couldn't fault the priest's logic. After a few moments of silence he nodded. &quot;Alright.&quot; Looks like he had a little bit more work to do before the main event after all. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
9 45 AM--Juanita the husky <br />
<br />
Naomi was loyal to a fault, and proud of this fact. She had been a husky for so long she no longer gave a damn if it was her own personality or just instincts. And if her pack leader had ordered that for the remainder of the wedding day, Naomi was to treat her pack leader as just another husky to be under Naomi's command, then Naomi was going to do precisely that. <br />
<br />
Naomi observed as the new husky looked positively giddy. Yipping, yapping, and feeling her body all over. The smile never leaving the new husky's face. Naomi remembered to remind the new husky to erase the logs as per her pack leader's orders before becoming the new husky for the day. <br />
<br />
The new husky quickly did so and perfectly without flaw, and then quickly went back to enjoying the sight of herself. Naomi let this go on as long as she could, letting the newest addition of her pack relax and work out the kinks of her new body.  However, the duty of making sure the wedding ran smoothly still ran top priority. And her pack leader had ordered that Naomi treat the new husky for the day like any other newbie and Naomi would obey these orders to the letter. <br />
<br />
Naomi barked, &quot;Okay newbie! Front and center!&quot; <br />
<br />
Without even thinking about it, the newest husky stood straight up and arms at her side.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay newbie.&quot; Naomi continued her commanding voice she used for all her sub pack members. &quot;For the rest of the day, your name is Jessica! Just Jessica! You always were Jessica!  Juanita doesn't exist! She never did!  You aren't part of the Management! You never were! You are a new member of the pack here at anthro park and nothing more! You listen to me! And only me! You don't ask questions! You only obey! Your duty is to the guests and to the pack! Everyone else in your head is garbage, get ride of it! Understood? Done?&quot; <br />
<br />
The husky continued to stand perfectly straight up, with a serious and submissive look on her face, &quot;For all of today my name is Jessica! Just Jessica! I am not Juanita! I never was Juanita!  I am NOT part of the Management! I never was! I am a new member of the pack of anthro park and nothing more! I listen to my alpha! And only my alpha! I don't ask! I obey! My duty is to the guests and to the pack!  Mam! Yes mam! Understood mam! Of course mam!&quot;  Every single thing that Naomi said to the new husky in that speech became total and absolute truth, with no room or question or doubt! <br />
<br />
&quot;Good newbie! Now I have to go make sure the guests are all happy and well going for the wedding! This is the most important event we've likely had at the park! And you won't mess it up! Will you newbie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mam! No mam!&quot; The new husky continued to stand at attention loyally. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Now! You have basic training and basic information about your duty and responsibilities correct?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mam! Yes mam! I have basic training and information needed for my duties to you and the pack and the guests!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good newbie. Now who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica Husky, member of the pack at TF Park USA, new member madam!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And who is Juanita?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never heard of her in my life madam!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good! For the rest of the day, Juanita is a non-entity! She never existed in your memories or your sense of self! Jessica Husky is the only self you have! The only self you ever had!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam!&quot; Jessica said loyally to her pack leader. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now let's get you ready for wedding detail.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam!&quot; Jessica responded instantly. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
10 AM--Marth and Hannah <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you ready?&quot; Hannah asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I'll ever be ready for this. But that's besides the point. So in a few hours, it's all over for better or worse, and done with.&quot; <br />
<br />
'He always has to have that stoic pose and introspective tone of voice about him.' Hannah thought, but it was one of things that made him interesting to her. <br />
<br />
Marth looked at her, looking at her face, &quot;Shouldn't you be with the others?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys aren't allowed at the bridal party, and I know you won't feel comfortable at the groom's party. And I don't want you all alone right now. So I'm being with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Thanks.&quot; He looked indirectly at the sun. The big hour was creeping closer and closer. <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. We're friends aren't we?&quot; Then Hannah grinned. And pulled out some black body paint. &quot;Now hold still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... what's zat?&quot; Marth stared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just your 'suit' all the other bucks who are a direct part of the ceremony are gonna 'dress up',  and you're not getting out of it anymore than I'm getting out wearing flowers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marth felt uncomfortable. &quot;What's it made of....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah kept on smiling, &quot;Oh natural dyes, minerals, took some experiments, but it'll stick to your fur for the entire wedding and reception. Now hold still.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'd prefer to go naked naked and not dressed naked.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't be such a big baby! It doesn't hurt and I won't touch your new guy thing, OR your antlers.&quot; Marth realized how important those were only after Hannah mentioned them. &quot;And I won't make you look silly, Lateisha and John already decided on all the patterns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Building up all his courage, Marth said, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Now stain up straight, this shouldn't take TOO long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, how long should it take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't know. Let's find out together!&quot;  <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
10 AM--Predator Hill <br />
<br />
The various predators and omnivores (who were unspokenly considered slightly strange by the herbivores and carnivores in general), were now gathering atop 'Predator Hill' which it would known as forever more. Proving they were better than their instincts, most were able fight off the urge to challenge for territory, or flee in the sight of the 'bigger fish.' Thankfully one of the newshounds had created a set of checkers. Something that hungrily devoured (figuratively) by the fellow predators. Entertainment in of itself was hard to come by in the park, except that made by the guests. Indeed, a human brain raised in western culture wasn't built for such constant idle time. Most park guests however never minded it. But the temptation of a good old fashioned mundane game of checker quickly had animals lining up. <br />
<br />
As seating spots were discussed and decided upon, Harrison looked a little apprehensively at Chris. The tale of the 'New Crazy Panther Girl' had been a hot topic among the news hounds as of late, and everyone knew her description. Seeing her muscles tighten ever so slightly underneath his fur he said, stuttering, <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, don't worry. Attraction between species just doesn't happen... &quot; Harrison made a point not to move any part of his body, his tail moved between the hound dog's legs. &quot;You're a good looking lass,&quot; muscles tightened more, &quot;But I don't, or rather, -can't- feel any physical attraction to you. So as long as you aren't near any single male panthers you otta be okay.&quot; Harrison relaxed greatly when he saw Chris' muscles relax. <br />
<br />
Chris' father was sitting near the back along with the other large predators. He poor man didn't really know anyone here, and was here only because his offspring was. After narrowly escaping the happy embrace of the bears' 'same gender attraction club' he had tried to hit on many of the female anthro bears who inhabited the park. He now bore the scars to prove it too. He was now sitting next to the ones who found his 'upfront and straight up' attitude towards relationships remotely charming and found his presence tolerable and relatively enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Personally he was freaked out by the whole changing X/Y chromosome thing he had heard the bride was all about. But apparently she was a fully functional female. He didn't get why anyone would want to continue to look like a escapee of the Island of Dr. Moreau after leaving here, but he had learn one of the keys to surviving any major social occasion was knowing when to keep your mouth shut (strangely this truth had escaped him when it came to women). At least his son if he survived this with his male Ego intact, would return with inside information on the female mentality. So why did that panther couple have to be so 'friendly' with his son? <br />
<br />
 &quot;You did good Chris, you did very good.&quot; Keith said in the panther girl's ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Chris breathed out. Maybe he would get through this with his male sense of self intact and still be able to enjoy this. Though actually, he had come to this wedding, so he could face his ultimate fear right in the face (as his father had taught him to), and behold a former fellow guy who had been totally lost to the dark side, yes there was Jackie, but since her male partner used to be female, it seemed like an even trade off. <br />
<br />
Chris fell backwards, making sure not to hit her tail and relaxed on the grassy hillside, closed her eyes, and just breathed in and out, clearing her mind of all things, doing her best to ignore the weight on her chest. He might have been missing his Y chromosome, and for all biological truths was currently female, he wouldn't betray his male self or identity. But for a moment, he remembered this was supposed to be a -vacation!- and just let go. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
10 AM--The bridal party<br />
<br />
When the buck arrived for the entertainment and amusement of the various does and other female herbivores, Leticia couldn't resist the slight pang of regret when she saw it wasn't Marth. She wouldn't abandon Jeremy, not after coming this far down her chosen road, but she realized, like Marth, she too wanted a chance to say good-bye, one that didn't end in harsh words or tears like last time. Or maybe they already had and Leticia was just getting wedding jitters. <br />
<br />
As it was, the male much posed, stretched, and basically did all the female does commanded of him, for the sake of the mate of the herd leader, for that was his duty at the time. And he didn't mind the attention of all the does either! It made him feel whole and complete with their approval and attention. It was a buck's duty to win such admiration and attention after all. <br />
<br />
Su Yin observed this with mild amusement, though wishing she had stolen a book from Hannah's room when she had the chance (books being her one true love). At least she knew what the climax of her book was going to be. Now she just needed to figure out what details to leave out for the sake of respect of privacy.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
10 AM--the grooms's party<br />
<br />
While none of the bucks could bring themselves to haze their herd leader, as was the normal tradition for men to do to their fellow male for 'betraying' their brotherhood of bachelors, that didn't stop Jeremy from looking over his shoulder.  <br />
<br />
But most of the bucks who thought of it settled for a pat on the back of their leader and alpha. The biggest surprise of course had been Jenny. Leaving Spike in Robbie's able hands, Jenny had made sure to make her appointment. <br />
<br />
This was her herd leader's big day, his biggest day of his life. And this was her duty and purpose for the pre-events. And thus Jenny allowed herself to become the Nymph of Anthro Park one last time, letting herself dive into the role without hesitation or regret. Dancing in front of the many bucks and taking in their appreciation and desire. Yes, this felt good, it made her happy. But Spike was what made her feel whole. <br />
<br />
She danced like a summer breeze among tall grass, putting her all into her performance, letting the bucks touch her and letting herself enjoy it. None dared violate her, she had slept with many of them, and each of them after Sam's departing speech had formed an intense respect for her that rivaled beauty Queen Hannah's. In a way she had almost envied how she had always played second fiddle to Hannah in those the males desired. But she evolved past that. This would be her goodbye to this piece of herself. Doth she danced, letting all restriction or inhibitions go, naked and free.</p>
