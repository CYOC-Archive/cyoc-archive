<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neil had never thought that he might be so readily bi-curious - but now, now it was just so...natural. Even as he realized with a start and a pondering expression that he did not start that way. This was not some sudden realization of a life-long desire that had been sublimated into other things. Something - something at the gym - had brought out these desires in him, planted a seed that had now blossomed into this new crop of desire within him. It had just as well turned Neil from the skinny and put upon young man into a rippling male bodybuilder. And here he was - here he was getting advice from Bradley on sex!<br />
<br />
After having just---just taken it up the ass from him, an experience Neil was admittedly, after the whole thing calmed down, still somewhat surprised he enjoyed as much as he did. It was something new, something he looked to explore from other angles. Maybe...maybe Sandra might be open to Neil fucking her...while Bradley fucked <i>him</i>! &quot;What can you tell me, Bradley,&quot; Neil said as he leaned forward, registering the feeling of his emission against his ass cheek, &quot;About sex. About fucking. I want---I&#39;d really love to be as skilled as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bradley leaned back and started in on it, &quot;Well, sex with a woman and sex with a man are two very different things, to start with.&quot; Bradley subtly flexed his chest and core, &quot;We guys on average have more body mass than a woman does, so sex can be a little more rough. A little more tough. We can on average handle the rougher kinds of play. Now, a woman on average due to natural differences you need to be a bit more careful with due to that natural weight difference and how big we in particular are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil nodded along as Bradley continued, &quot;Now, sex is way, way more than just pump pump pump pump done. There&#39;s foreplay you gotta account for, you gotta make sure both parties are having a good time. And consent! Consent consent consent! Don&#39;t be pushy - if she or he says no, that means no. Don&#39;t go any further than that. Comprehend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Neil responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Bradley stated, &quot;Now, in particular a woman&#39;s pleasure centers can be...interesting. You gotta remember her clit. Don&#39;t just think you can pump away. Make sure you&#39;re both having fun. Now, we guys...not many guys are familiar with the prostate, aka, the male g-spot. And especially if it&#39;s a dude&#39;s first time. Don&#39;t forget lube, and make sure you&#39;re gentle. No thrusting all the way in on the first time. That&#39;s a way to get someone hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; Neil contemplated, &quot;...Yeah. Yeah. Thanks Bradley.&quot; He figured nothing was exactly like what Hollywood showed. Brokeback and the infamous spit lube in particular. Ouch, based on what Bradley was saying. &quot;I think with this in mind I&#39;m gonna see about asking Sandra out! Hopefully she&#39;ll say yes and we might---uh, have some fun times. Would you be up to join if she&#39;s okay with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Bradley grinned and leaned back, &quot;You can count me in any day that Sandra wants two hunks in her bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like some fun.&quot; Neil got up and started moving to get dressed.  He noted his clothes fit him a little more snugly still. He wondered - was he done growing for the day? He hoped so, he didn&#39;t exactly want to burst a seam in the middle of a date with Sandra or something. &quot;Can I get a ride from you back to the shopping center by the gym?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing man. And again, best of luck.&quot; Bradley then leaned in to Neil as the two started heading out, &quot;Just between us, Sandra&#39;s into some pretty freaky kinky stuff. Hope you&#39;re ready for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil blushed and wondered what that might be. Still, he was a freaking muscle man now. He had nothing to be nervous about in approaching Sandra like this. Thus, he and Brad headed out the door once the trainer was dressed again - this time in a white tank top and shorts, which seemed to barely conceal anything.<br />
<br />
As they got in the car, Brad brought him in for another kiss, &quot;There we go. A kiss for luck, and hopefully, a fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
As Neil got out of the car at the shopping center, he thought about everything that happened so far, and gathered the courage when he saw Sandra walking around window-shopping. He breathed, &quot;Okay Neil, don&#39;t let her think you&#39;re a weirdo or a creep...no matter how weird it is that you&#39;re this buff after six days.&quot; As he started walking over, it seemed Sandra noticed him and then just simply went on, but then when he got closer she jumped and acted surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, Neil?&quot; She looked him over, &quot;Wow, Neil. Bodybuilding sure has agreed with you. Nice arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; He said, flexing one of them - and grinning a little when he felt her hand move over confidently and without issue to begin feeling up his bicep. Just the feeling of a woman appreciating and touching his muscles made his dick pulse a little. But he kept control of it. He didn&#39;t want to just spring an erection when he had just worked up the courage to talk to her and more to the point, ask her out! &quot;I&#39;ve been uh, working out every day.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Every day of these last six days. And somehow, somehow, I&#39;ve ended up fucking jacked.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;And it really shows...very nice.&quot; She said - and Neil shivered as her hand touched his shoulders and upper chest. Surely, he thought, surely she had to know what touching him like that was doing. But maybe she didn&#39;t. Maybe she was just that awestruck. Maybe it was like that scene in that one movie with the lady touching her supersoldier boyfriend&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
<i>I&#39;ll bet Cap gave her some supersoldier dick that night.</i> Woah Neil, he thought, his mind almost veering off into the depths of the gutter. He knew if he went there she&#39;d have a lot more to notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh.&quot; Neil started, flush all of a sudden, &quot;I was wondering. Would you be willing to uh, y&#39;know, go out with me? Like, just out? On the town maybe? Go to the rollerblade rink or something? Maybe a movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you are adorable.&quot; Sandra smirked a little and then just...nodded, &quot;Very interesting tastes. I think I&#39;d love to go out with you, Neil. My last boyfriend really didn&#39;t give me much of what I needed. More than that, I was just a thing that <i>he</i> needed. A prize, an object to show off around his friends. So I&#39;d like to have someone willing to give me a good time in more than just bed. Though I don&#39;t doubt you&#39;re VERY proficient in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil outright gasped when he felt her slap his ass. She remarked on it, &quot;...And DAMN. That felt like smacking cement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I try, I try.&quot; Neil said with a smile as he and Sandra started to head off to enjoy their date. Sandra seemed intent first on continuing to look around. Neil for his part was inclined to agree - maybe it was stereotypical of him, but he was starting to think he might have a stronger appreciation for the look certain clothes have. The way they cling to his muscles, the way they set off his tan and his hair color.<br />
<br />
And as the two went around, Neil noted with some degree of satisfaction that she was really looking at and seeming impressed by his bodily development. As they walked, she asked him, &quot;Could I...feel your bicep, by any chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Neil said with a smile, &quot;Yeah I&#39;m into that.&quot; It took very little effort to flex and make his arm look truly impressive. Neil was no Bradley - but he was certainly bigger than the average guy was by far. Certainly bigger than the jock she used to go out with by this point. Definitely at this point based on what Neil had seen of Matt prior to that day. Unless somehow the guy had been putting on size all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
And speak of the devil however, as Sandra and Neil headed out of the store - Neil carrying a new tank top with a pretty nice new bright blue color that he felt really set off his looks, who should they run into but Matt. And Neil was at once taken somewhat aback by the way Matt was looking now. It was definite that Matt looked very, very different from the guy Neil dreaded every single day he went to school or to the gym. In fact, he found himself contemplating some strange new reaction to Matt&#39;s looks;<br />
<br />
The jock interposed himself in front of them, yet he was not quite the jock he used to be. His body seemed somewhat less brawny and a deal more toned and tight, his face less imposingly handsome and more the preening look of a pretty boy of a very specific type. He looked as if he might be at home cruising in some of the more gay-relevant areas of town, and Neil almost found himself suppressing a strange reaction to Matt. Those thick lips, kissable and sensuous, looked prime to be wrapped around some man&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
In every way, Matt was starting to look less like the jock he was  - and more like some sort of winsome, gorgeous twink. Not that it seemed Matt himself even realized it. &quot;Who---Who the hell do you---fucking hell. Fucking fuck! Neil!? Neil Booth?&quot; His eyes went wild in the moment, and even Sandra found herself curious to see what the end reaction was going to be.<br />
<br />
She knew well enough from her role in things that Matt had been at the gym at the same rate Neil had been. And how it seemed his own fixation on Neil&#39;s perceived femininity and this idea of the &quot;twink&quot; had translated in such a way into a transformation. One that inexorably took Matt further away from what he was - and toward something he would&#39;ve regarded with disdain merely a week ago!<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s mind it seemed reeled at the knowledge now that Neil - slender and boyish, tiny Neil - now towered above him in weight and strength. Neil however took in the sight of the toned and boyish Matt, and restrained his immediate reaction. The more bi-curious element in him immediately reacted - his cock growing slightly harder with interest. Oh, two lovely people tonight to drive his meat into. The sweltering and beautiful Sandra...and the mouthy, defiant Matt!<br />
<br />
But Neil was not a creature purely of his instincts. He knew well enough that he needed to find out more about this. And this was a great opportunity. And he could tell that the nature evolving within Matt and his old, homophobic ways were clashing within him. Matt&#39;s anger was faltering and mixing with some sort of fascination.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s mouth hung open as he evaluated Neil, &quot;You...you what? You think you can get my girl if you&#39;re...you&#39;re just a bit taller, more muscular...sexier...? You think that makes you better than me---!?&quot; Matt gulped, a desire burning through him that he both could not and did not want to comprehend. He feared that if he did he might all at once lose any and all control of himself. <br />
<br />
And Neil understood that immediately. He knew if he answered the puzzle of this arousal - a desire for both Sandra&#39;s luscious and soft femininity and Matt&#39;s angular, pretty new phase of masculinity, he might find himself submerged even further in his changes. He hardly even noticed that as he experienced this absolute roil in his inward perception that his muscles twitched and grew slightly larger still, biceps teasing and twitching just enough to strain his sleeves.<br />
<br />
Sandra stepped in then and there, and spoke to the both of them, &quot;Now, I&#39;m nobody&#39;s possession, but it&#39;s pretty clear Matt that Neil and I have started going out. And you&#39;re going to have to deal with that...but.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...But?&quot; Matt uttered, glaring at Neil. Trying to be angry - rather than horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...how much do you want to still have sex with me?&quot; Sandra asked with a twinkle in her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot!&quot; Matt answered, and Neil was starting to realize where this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; Sandra stated, looking at the two changing young men who were having a distinctly hard time keeping their eyes off of each other, &quot;How about this. Matt, if you can handle the idea of sharing me in bed with Neil, and touching him too, this can be a happy three way relationship. Otherwise...you&#39;re out.&quot;</p>
