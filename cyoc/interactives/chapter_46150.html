<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stare out at the sea of children's faces as you slowly pump yourself on the swing. It's been two days since you first sat down next to Jake on the bus and the realisation that he no longer knew hit home...something that is still bothering you.<br />
<br />
And as if that wasn't bad enough, when you entered school, you automatically made a beeline for your classes. Only to find out that class you headed for where at least a grade below what you where normally at. Bothered by this, you waited for someone to ask if you were in the right classroom, but no one asked.<br />
<br />
All the rest of the day, it was the same thing. And to add to all this, people talked to you and acted like you were a girl...which was fine because wasn't that what you wished for in the first place, to be a girl?<br />
<br />
And the confusion didn't end there. After school, your mom picked you up and sitting in the front seat you noticed Sally sitting in the back, in a booster seat. Something she hasn't needed since she was about five or six. Puzzled by this, you follow the course of things as your mom takes you to the mall and explaining you need new shoes and a dress, she takes you to several clothes stores to buy you new clothes.<br />
<br />
Afterward you, Sally and your mom grab dinner in the food court and begin to head home. The drive passes in silence until you ask, &quot;When's dad getting home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately your mom tenses up and you know that you've said something wrong. Before you can guess, your mom explains, &quot;Honey. We've talked about this. Your dad isn't coming home. You know this. Now, lets not upset anyone, especially Sally. You know how she reacts when we talk about your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gazing into the back, seeing Sally asleep in her booster seat, you quietly reply, &quot;Yes ma'am,&quot; and turn your attention back to your previous thoughts.<br />
<br />
But you have no answer to what's going on. Sally's decrease in age, your father leaving, Jake no longer being your friend and you being in a lower grade then what you were yesterday. You wonder briefly if you should remind your mom that you are supposed to have a doctor's appointment today and then decide that your mom has enough to worry about at the moment.<br />
<br />
Home, you mother takes in Sally and you silently take inside the new purchases. Taking your backpack up to your room, you are momentarily surprised and the changes your room has undergone, but then figuring it might be normal for a girl's room, you sling your pack onto the Hello Kitty comforter covering your bed and sitting down at the vanity that has now replaced your desk, you begin your homework.<br />
<br />
Part way though, you remember the note and begin to frantically search for it before your realise that it is in a book deemed appropriate for someone in a high grade then what you are currently at.<br />
<br />
Sighing, you pull out another notebook and idly begin to write inside it. After a bit, you realise that what you've written is the wish you made. Gazing at the words, you wonder how wishing to be a girl could cause all that has happened. &quot;Don't forget to take a shower before bed, honey,&quot; a voice tells you, interrupting your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Turning you see your mother setting some fresh laundered clothes on your bed...all girl's clothing you see...and then as she begins to sort them, you reply, &quot;Yes ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Setting down the shirt, she walks over to you and placing a hand to your forehead, she asks, &quot;Are you feeling all right? You been quieter and more with drawn then normal. Maybe it's this bug that's going around right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head and quietly you tell her, &quot;I'm fine. Just a little tired is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother removes her hand and mumbles something about a full day and school and turns back to the clothes. As she does this, you turn back to the copy of the note and try to find out what went wrong. After a bit, your mom leaves and deciding you've had enough, you get up to take a bath before bed.<br />
<br />
The next day proved to be even weirder. You were awoken by a baby crying and it took you a few minutes before you realised that it was actually Sally. Figuring you were all ready awake, you glance at the clock...which is a My Little Pony figure with a digital readout in its side...you note the time and begin to get up for school. As you are doing this, your mom passes your room...holding Sally who now appears to be about two...and tells you, &quot;Breakfast is on the table, princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bothered by this, you shrug and begin to undress. It takes you awhile to put things together, but when you do it is then that you start to worry that something is amiss.<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind is that Sally is younger...a lot younger to be more specific. The next thing you realise is that you are now wearing a pink flannel nightgown with Disney Princesses on the front...something you know you didn't put on the previous evening, but you can't remember what. Looking into the mirror brought new shocks as you took in your appearance.<br />
<br />
Gazing into the reflective object, you see that your hair now goes down about midpoint of your back. Your face is now rounder and softer and your general complexion is paler. Your shoulders are a little bit smaller and your arms have begun to slim down. Legs are now completely devoid of hair and have also started to slim down. Suddenly worried when you see the pink underwear you are wearing and no noticeable bulge, you hastily pull them off.<br />
<br />
Standing naked as the day you were born, you sigh in relief as you gaze at your penis and testicles, trying to grasp at what has changed. It takes you awhile before you can put your finger on the fact that they are smaller and more prepubescent looking. Sighing again, you turn and head toward the dresser.<br />
<br />
Now, a day later, you listen to the screaming of the children around you as you pump the swing into motion. You are now in the fourth grade, yesterday it was the sixth, and your appearance is more feminine then what it was. In fact, except for your penis and testicles, people couldn't possibly miss you as anything else but a little girl. And the odd thing, your mom and teachers have started addressing you as a little girl's name.<br />
<br />
But that's not the weirdest of it all. The weirdest thing is that for some reason the week has started over and yesterday and today have been the same day...Monday.<br />
<br />
A bell signaling the end of recess draws you out of your thoughts and leaping off the swing, you begin to make your way inside with the rest of the children. Heading toward Ms Applebees class...torn between like the jeans with no zipper or buttons in the front and the Hello Kitty shirt you are currently wearing and thinking that they are inappropriate for you...you suddenly put your finger on what went wrong with the wish.<br />
<br />
Thinking to yourself, you explain, &quot;Yes, I did wish to be a girl. But I either used the wrong word and should have said I wanted to be a female teenager or should have written that I wanted to be a girl the same age as what I previously was.&quot; <br />
<br />
And as you mull over these thoughts, you shrug off your pink and purple coat and sitting down at your desk you realise that in order to undo what's been down you have to retrieve the note somehow...something that is not going to be easy task for a teenage male turned young girl.</p>
