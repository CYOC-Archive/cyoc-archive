<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Come on man we have to go!” shouted Scotty to Eric, his face seeming to get more and more attractive by the <br />
second. <br />
<br />
“Why Scotty? You saw how hot it that last race was, this one is going to be even better.” responded Eric in a <br />
very calm tone. <br />
<br />
	Scotty couldn't help but note how gorgeous Eric was becoming. He was actually beginning to find the <br />
idea of seeing Eric get transformed into a beautiful stallion rather arousing.  In fact, he was getting <br />
aroused by how great all of the men around him were looking. Deep down, Scotty wanted to be just like them.<br />
<br />
“Scotty! What the hell are you doing! Grab Eric and let's go!” Riley's shouting broke Scotty out of his trance <br />
and back to reality, but only for a moment. Part of him seemed to forget why there such a rush.<br />
<br />
	Shaking his head in an attempt to clear his thoughts, Scotty looked up at Eric, at his beautiful ears <br />
and then down to his gorgeous tail. He thought Eric looked so wonderful and secretly felt the urge to be just <br />
like him. At that moment he felt a slight tingle in his ears and another near his tailbone. He slowly reached <br />
his hands up and felt his ears. They were slowly moving and changing, repositioning and reshaping into those <br />
of a horse. He felt something brush again his legs and looked back, seeing a tail. These changes filled him <br />
with joy. Now he was just like them. Gorgeous soon-to-be stallions. A thought began to form in his mind, a <br />
thought about racing, running as fast as he could and showing all the other men around him that he was the <br />
fastest.<br />
<br />
Riley watched in disbelief as Scotty's ears and tail grew. A strong part of him wanted to go and rescue his <br />
friends but after seeing what happened to Scotty, an even stronger part was telling him to run and save <br />
himself. He started to yell one last time to Scotty, but was interrupted by the sound of the announcer coming <br />
through the speakers. He didn't notice the two men following after him.<br />
<br />
“Looks like we have a new contestant to this race folks, let's give him a warm welcome!” Unable to be heard <br />
through the chorus of yelling fans, Riley turned and ran. He had to get as far away as possible.<br />
<br />
	Scotty was ecstatic, the urge to race with the rest of the men had grown even stronger and then he <br />
announcer had confirmed his new dream. He was actually going to race with them. Scotty walked away from Eric <br />
and took his place at the starting line. The only thing separating him from the others was his attire. They <br />
were all dressed up as they should be and he was wearing casual clothing. Scotty didn't care though, he was <br />
going to race, that was all that mattered. He could see that the last of the tattered clothing of the previous <br />
race was being removed.<br />
<br />
“Alright ladies and gentlemen, the next race will begin soon! I hope all our fine racers are ready!” shouted <br />
the announcer, his voice full of energy and easily sent the crowd into a frenzy.<br />
<br />
Scotty was ready. Eric was ready. All the other men were ready.<br />
<br />
“On your marks!” shouted the announcer. All the men, Scotty included, crouched down, ready to take off as soon <br />
the gates opened.<br />
<br />
“Get set!....GO!” <br />
<br />
	The gates flew open and they were off. Scotty took off with a speed he didn't know he had, passing <br />
several of the racers and ran side by side with Eric. He had never felt so alive in his entire life. About <br />
halfway around the track and Scotty had passed Eric and was only one person away from first place. He needed <br />
more speed, more power.<br />
<br />
	Scotty watched the person in front him him begin to stagger and slow down, his body seemed to be <br />
ballooning out. Scotty quickly passed the man but soon felt strange himself. He kept running as best he could, <br />
but with his rapidly changing body, it was becoming harder to run like a human. He could feel inside his <br />
shoes, his feet and toes where changing, lengthening out and his toes fused together and became hooves. He <br />
easily slipped out of his shoes as his pants began to tear from his rapidly expanding lower body.<br />
<br />
	He began to slow more and felt his fingers and arms begin to change in the same manner of his legs and <br />
feet. His fingers clenched into a fist and hardened into hooves and his arms stretched and became the front <br />
legs of a horse. He also noted that his nostrils seemed larger and his head had seemed to elongate out, taking <br />
on more of a equine appearance. He stumbled on his hooves and fell, somehow, he managed to catch himself from <br />
falling with his front legs, his body quickly repositioning itself, locking Scotty in a four legged stance. He <br />
never missed a step though, after that brief stagger, he resumed running on all fours. He felt a tingle flow <br />
though his body as fur sprouted all around it. He felt so free, so alive.<br />
<br />
Finally his face finished its transformation into a horse, completing his change. Scotty was the first horse <br />
to cross the finish line and was filled with pride. He slowed to a stop and watched as the other horses <br />
finished the race. Eric came in second and the other racers followed suit.<br />
<br />
“Looks like we have another bunch of winners folks! Let's give them all a big hand!”  shouted the announcer<br />
<br />
	Scotty saw a something slide over his head and felt something cold and metallic slide into his mouth. <br />
He turned and saw a man near him, adjusting the bridle he had just put on him. The quickly attached some <br />
reigns and led Scotty into the back of a horse trailer. He watched as the man grabbed another bridle and <br />
slipped it on Eric, leading him into the trailer. Once by one the horses were put into the trailer.<br />
<br />
“Alright folks, let's meet the line-up for the third race!” <br />
<br />
Scotty turned his head towards the entrance to the field. He saw a bunch of men with horse ears and tails, <br />
dressed up like all the others racers so far. What he didn't expect to see was Riley, who was walking in line <br />
with the other racers, his horse ears and tail accenting him nicely. Scotty neighs a greeting to Riley but <br />
he's too far away to really hear it, but he was happy. <br />
<br />
“Riley will make a great stallion.” Scotty thought to himself as he leaned down to nibble on the hay that was <br />
laying in the trailer.<br />
<br />
He didn't even notice as the trailer jerked into motion and they drove away.</p>
