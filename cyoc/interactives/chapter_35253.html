<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After you finished your meal, and your Master finished his, both of you went upstairs to go to bed. The steps creaked as you walked up them, your canine claws clicking on the hardwood that the house's floors were made of. &quot;Rahr rahr!&quot; you said to your master as he went into the bathroom. He didn't seem to understand you, your canine vocal cords unable to utter human words. He prepared to close the door and you looked at him with puppy eyes. &quot;No boy, stay out here.&quot; And so you stayed. You could get to this whole dog servant thing. You loved doing what your Master said, no matter what he said to do. Still, your altered canine mind was rather disappointed to be separated from your Master. You decided instead of simply waiting outside his door you would look around the house. Being a young and healthy Labrador retriever you couldn't really interact with things the way you could have as a human. Your forepaws with long nails were a poor replacement for human hands. Fragments of your human mind still remained intact, mostly those that didn't contradict your new mentality. As dogs go, you were pretty smart. But the part of your mind that would be opposed to anything at all your new Master commanded was pretty well erased. You smelled the old dust of the house. Curiously, you smelled everything that you came into contact with, like any dog would. Your human mind, or at least what remained of it, didn't conflict with your canine ways at all. If it did, it was overwritten by the effects of the transformation. Your human mind seemed to have a bit more effect when your Master wasn't around. You could slightly think on your own, but his will was left in your mind, so even in his absence you couldn't disobey his command. When he was around you became just a totally horny dog panting and waiting to be told what to do. Thinking of him made you horny. Your big lab balls didn't seem at all drained by the little incident in the master's car. So you resolved to masturbate. But you didn't have hands. With perked ears you looked down at your 8-inch cock locked up in your sheath. You bent in on yourself, your canine nose picking up the familiar smell of your own musk. your rough tongue came out to touch your sheath. Soon it slid into your sheath, exciting the tip of your red pointed dong. A voice somewhere seemed convinced that this was disgusting and a bad idea. This seemed unfamiliar to you, and for a moment you pause, turning your head sideways to consider. Then the nay-saying voice was snuffed out by the smell of your musk as your cock started to slip from it's sheath. Forgetting why you had stopped, you bend back down and start shamelessly licking your own cock. Your rough tongue goes out to massage your doggy cock's piss-slit. How exactly you knew how to give such damn-good head was a mystery, it was part human memory, part instinct. You knew what made you and your master feel good, so that's what you did. Soon your dick was out in full freedom, so you took it into your muzzle. Slowly you started bobbing down and up on your dog meat, sucking in as best you can with dog lips. Once or twice you switched between sucking your dick and giving attention to your balls. The fur around your crotch became damp with saliva as your balls rolled around in your mouth. Soon your drool was all over, and it lubricated your doggy rod as you continued to go down on it. The knot began to form at the base of your canine dick, you were close to climax. A mix of drool, pre, and cock swirled around in your muzzle. You could tell you were close to cumming. Then suddenly you stopped, your engorged canine dick still in your mouth. There it was again, your Master was calling you. You pulled your mouth off of your cock, and swallowed your own pre. Once you stopped sucking and smelling your own musk, you began to once again notice the smells of dust and mold around you. A short trot later, you were in your Master's room. He was naked, and that restored whatever rock-hardness your cock had lost on the walk through the house. He glanced at your throbbing cock, then your eyes looking at his flaccid one. &quot;Not tonight boy, I'm tired.&quot; The disappointment was clear in your lonesome canine eyes. You could tell your Master felt sorry for you. &quot;I guess you can finish yourself up though, just lap it up like a good boy and don't make a mess, okay?&quot; Oh you Master was so nice, you barked happily and went up to lick his face, and all over his body, you're tongue moving down almost sub-consciously. But soon he pushed you off. &quot;I said no boy, now hurry and finish, I want to sleep.&quot; Then you somewhat grudgingly went down on the ground and started sucking yourself off again. Soon you were too busy sucking yourself to worry about not being with the Master too much. &quot;Come on boy, hurry up.&quot; He said, as you increased your pace. Must make Master happy, must hurry. Those were the thoughts going through your canine mind as you shoved you doggy rod down your throat. Deep throating your own meat was enough to send you over the edge, sending your doggy load down your throat. The salty-sweet flavor satisfied you. Your cum filled your stomach, to mix with your Master's and your before. &quot;Up boy.&quot; Your Master called as he patted on the bed. Licking the cum from your lips you hopped up on the bed. You laid down next to the Master as he covered up both of you with the sheets. Soon you were sleeping soundly with your furry body rubbing up against your Master's naked skin. As you began to fall asleep, you thought of how great it was to make your Master happy.</p>
