<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Graham woke with mid-afternoon sun in his eyes. He could smell Bear fur. Had he got lucky last night? He ached slightly, but as he thought about it the pains vanished. He tried to remember what had happened…..but he drew a blank after going to that yard. A pleasant memory of a Bear dream washed back to him and his cock twitched, he was hard he realised. With his eyes still shut, and his body soaking up the warm sunlight he reached out a hand and grabbed his cock. Deep Pleasure rushed through him as he stroked himself, and a small ummmm rumbled from his throat. He pulled himself off enjoying long, long strokes almost unable to get his big hand round his mighty meat. Even as he realised something was not quite right orgasm rushed through him and he exploded over his hand, gut, legs, chest, and onto his own face! He pulled until nothing else was left, he was panting deeply and the ecstasy was raw. <br />
“Oh man” he rumbled, and realised that was not his voice. He rubbed his hand up and down the thick slick, cock- that was not his cock either! <br />
<br />
Graham took stock. His body felt strange, massive, and heavy. He lifted his arm to his face- the arm felt too big. He rubbed a wrong sized hand over the thick beard he sported now. That was defiantly his face. He opened his eyes……..and his cock throbbed back to full hardness….the hand and arm in front of him was massive, and so covered in hair to nearly be fur! He flexed fingers as big as some men’s cocks and turned the hand over and over in the sunlight. Slowly he became aware that all his body felt like this- massive, hairy, and muscular. He could feel the strength in his new form. He also became aware of the two snoring people in this room. Slowly he took deep sniffs and realised they where next to him, but to his right side. He realised them that something else has changed too- he could feel it in his mind, the Beast was there. He was a Werebear. <br />
<br />
Slowly Graham stood. He was very, very aware that his balance was wrong, off, centred down not his springy legs like before, but in the massive barrel torso he now sported. He stepped away from the massive sleeping men, away from the remains of a sling. He had questions about what happened. He recognised the Play Room, and could even see his canvas bags by the doors on the far side of the sleeping men- fellow Werebear's he knew by instinct. As he stood and took stock he rubbed a hand over his big, furry gut, and twiddled his nipples, which pointed down towards the floor, folded over on his massive hairy pecs. He flexed unconsciously, getting used to the power his nearly 9’ body processed. <br />
<br />
Things slowly came together in his mind. If this was the play room, then the 7 foot, light browned hairy gent with his broad roadmap of a back to him, was the man he’d seen at the Bank, the yard owner. He felt an odd twitch about him. He had no reason to stay, he could take off right now, but that would not get him the answers to what had happened to spark his change, his shift. Plus somehow he owed him- if he had not come here then he would not be nearly 500lbs of muscle, hair, and Bear! So who was the other Bear? He was as tall as the Owner, but darker brown haired and thicker through, his muscles overall slightly bigger, not as big as Graham’s new body but….. Was he the one who changed him? He didn’t know him, yet he was here and therefore linked with the Owner. As they slept they had actually draped arms over each other, both protective and loving. <br />
<br />
Graham couldn’t leave (none of the clothes here would fit him for one thing!), he needed answers, and he needed to thank them. There was a debt here. He looked out the window at the massive piles of junk in the many acres of yard. Perhaps they would need a new yard hand? He rubbed his thick chest after all this powerhouse would be cheaper than any lifting machine! Graham grinned to himself and stepped over the darker haired ones thick legs to the bed, he climbed onto it. He would wait here for them to awake and the explanations to begin.</p>
