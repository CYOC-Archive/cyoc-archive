<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A place to rejuvenate the body and the soul, return vigor and increase it twofold. These were the words that advertised Misfit Island, a paradise just a click away. At first glance, the advertisement seemed like a scam. The pictures looked enticing with their promises of endless food, amusement parks, and pristine coastlines that stretch for miles. It was too good to be true. But buying a ticket won&#39;t hurt given its suspicious low price. To recuperate from their long and stressful college term, Ken and Cole bought two tickets that appeared on their respective phones. After a week, they packed their bags and fled on a cruise ship heading to their destined island.<br />
<br />
The cruise ship alone makes up the price of the tickets. There were shops inside and all of their items are free for the taking. Ken is taking up business, and being analytical of the two, he can&#39;t help but wonder how this business is keeping itself afloat. Cole is taking up engineering and he already had his fair share of academic problems. They came to this island to chill, not to stress on problems that are out of their concern. Ken sighed. His best friend is right. He finished the bloody mary on his hand, and just as he finished the last gulp, the island appeared along the horizon with the rising sun.<br />
<br />
The island stretches for miles. On its eastern part is a tall stratovolcano with a thin trail of smoke coming from the tip. The cruise ship&#39;s horn bellowed. Within minutes, the ship reached the docks, and the two college students on vacation are out with their bags. <br />
<br />
Like what the ads said, these islands are only reserved for males. Wherever they look, there are only men and men alone. Old men are shuffling along with their wheelchairs. Children as young as 4 with their dads, brothers, and cousins. There are buff half-naked men, their toned bodies shining from a thin film of sweat. But there are also thin men with subtle contours on their stomachs, men like Ken and Cole.<br />
<br />
Ken and Cole may be excited to lounge as soon as possible, but an official from the island called onto the newcomers and asked them to follow him to the reception center. The official towered over the two, and are equally daunted with the sheer width of his muscles. His hair is as red as a ruby, he wore a lei on his neck complete with an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt that revealed his sweaty abs. He was a cordial fellow that smiled and greeted the guests. He divided the newcomers by batch then lead them to separate rooms where the television is waiting for them. <br />
<br />
Ken and Cole sat near the middle where Ken found an acquaintance behind him. It&#39;s a kid who looked between 10-15 years old, brown hair with bright amber eyes. Despite being a newcomer as well, he is already shirtless and in his swimming trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhh…&quot; The kid groaned. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to go to the island already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this your second time on the island, kid?&quot; Ken asked.<br />
<br />
The kid stared at him, offense evident in his eyes, &quot;First off, I&#39;m not a kid, mister. And second, this is my fourth time on this island. How about you? Is this your first time on the island?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, do. I&#39;m probably as excited as you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; The kid chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m excited alright but probably for different reasons. Also, good luck and don&#39;t get your body lost as I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, &#39;get my body lost&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid was about to answer but a representative beside the television hushed them up. He closed the lights in the room and opened the television. The video started with the island name &#39;Misfit Island - the place to rejuvenate the body and soul&#39; followed by the logo of a tiki torch-lit with a bluish fire. The screen turned dark then returned to a view of the island&#39;s beaches. The official who guided them before appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Misfit Island - the place to rejuvenate the body and soul for men like me and you.&quot; He smiled followed by a wink. &quot;My name is Connor Martins and I am here to introduce you to the island, its guides, and regulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scene changed with a subtle jingle of piano and violins in the background. The next scene is Martin beside a billboard showing the map of the entire island. From its looks, the island is shaped like a leaf and the roads are its veins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we tackle the map, let us first dive into a mini-history lesson on the island. The island is owned by Kerrigan Martins, my great grandfather. It used to be a private island where he and his family spent their summer months, frolicking on the beach and dwelling with the local flora and fauna. But soon, his life would take a drastic turn when his wife died. This place reminded him of his wife. After years of anguish, he decided that this place must change from a place of sorrow to a place where men like him could throw away their problems and focus only on the rejuvenation of their bodies and souls.<br />
<br />
This map behind me details the entire map of the island. As you can see, it&#39;s shaped like a leaf as designed according to the vision of Kerrigan Martins. As of this moment, you are here on Petiole Hall listening to your trusted and handsome guide. Walk north and you&#39;ll reach Midrib Avenue that connects all of the island amenities. Each corner in the avenue leads to a street leading to different services and amenities on the island. These services are for yours to discover. In the cases where you find yourself lost, just look for the tall fire columns that stretch to the skies. These are placed along the center of Midrib Avenue and look even brighter in the evening.<br />
<br />
And with that, the regulations.<br />
<br />
While most of the island is accessible, entering the tip of the island near the volcano is extremely prohibited. The place is under heavy security and entering the place means you forfeit your life per the contract when you bought your tickets. Your phones are also confiscated but will soon be returned to you after you leave the island. In the meantime, they are replaced with these misfit phones. They work like your regular phones but with added features. You can call a servant anytime and anywhere on the island. How neat is that!? You can also add fellow vacationers to the island&#39;s personal social media and record your lavish journey during your stay.<br />
<br />
And with that, I wish you all a happy vacation. Misfit Island - the place to rejuvenate your body and souls!&quot; With that, the pre-recorded video ended with a smile and wink from Connor Martins.<br />
<br />
The representative opened the lights and walked around with a basket where the newcomers can pick from different colored Misfit phones. Ken picked green and Cole picked black. The doors opened, and the newcomers left for their respective destinations. Ken and Cole decided to hit the hotel first to leave their items. Like what the advertisement said, the check-in is totally free and there is free meal delivery per call 24-hours a day. They entered their rooms and were surprised that it was far larger and extravagant than their dorms. Settling in took in a jiffy. They dressed up in their outdoor clothes and looked for Midrib Avenue. They found the map where Connor did his video, and from there - they decided to look for their first destination.</p>
