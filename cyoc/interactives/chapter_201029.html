<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But are you feeling alright? You&#39;re looking pretty pale there, dude,&quot; Kyle told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Really? I feel fine. Maybe a little dizzy, but class was boring so it&#39;s probably that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went on with his day, trying to ignore the increasing fogginess in his head, but whenever he tried to focus in class, all he could think about was breasts. By the end of third period, Dan was feeling way too lightheaded, so he stopped by the bathroom. He looked into the mirror and confirmed what Kyle had said. His skin was now white as a sheet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am sick?&quot; Dan told himself, feeling more lightheaded by the second. He was getting out of the bathroom, worried about his health, when he bumped into Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Dan, I’m so excited to see the progress on your transformation!&quot; Kat said gleefully. Then she took a long look at Dan and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kat, what is happening to me?&quot; Dan asked, fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you this morning. You are becoming your inner self. I can’t quite yet tell what that is, but I think you aren’t going to stay animate very long.&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I going to die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the moment, yes. But Mom asked me to alter the spell real quickly, so when you do transform, your soul, thoughts, memories, and even senses remain. So let me do that real quick…&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan didn’t get a chance to think this over. Kat immediately tapped Dan on the face with a stick, causing his lightheadedness to go away.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. Can’t wait to see you at my party! If you can’t move there, magic will find a way,&quot; Kat winked.<br />
<br />
The remaining classes Dan had before lunch flew quickly by as he distracted himself with thoughts about boobs, and as he poked the strange new texture of his face. It felt soft and delicate, like fabric, but sturdier than his shirt. Nobody else seemed to notice these changes.<br />
<br />
Dan, Kyle, Max, Holly and Lilly all sat together for lunch. Dan didn’t grab any food. Not because he wasn&#39;t hungry, but because nothing seemed appetizing to him. He was craving something, but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on what exactly. So insteading of eating, he crumpled next to Lilly, feeling weak and deflated. None of the others commented on Dan’s state. However, Dan did feel this huge urge to snuggle against Lilly&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
After lunch Dan and Lilly walked to class together. Dan noticed that he shrunk a lot, to the point where he was even smaller than Lilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilly, do you think there is something wrong with me?&quot; Dan finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I think you are perfect for the party. You are going to look great, even if others don&#39;t notice you.&quot; Lilly said, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t know if I can come, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you have your sister’s party. But I’m sure you can show up for a couple of minutes at the beginning. I’ll even come with you, if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly’s last sentence came out a bit different. It was as if she was forced to say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess. I think Kat will want you there,&quot; Dan said. Similar to Lilly, he didn’t really try to say it. It was as if the words just came out on there own.<br />
<br />
Lilly spent the rest of the class admiring Dan’s appearance. By then end of class, he was even shorter. His neck also seemed to have disappeared, with his head level with his chest.<br />
<br />
Dan didn’t have any more classes with anyone until the last period, where he was with Max.<br />
<br />
Max didn’t even acknowledge Dan’s existence during class. Even when Dan tried to talk, Max didn’t listen. In fact, neither did Dan’s teacher. After passing out graded tests, the teacher skipped over Dan. When Dan asked her about it, she ignored him as if he wasn’t there.<br />
<br />
After school, Dan struggled to walk home. The transformation was very subtle, and he couldn’t feel many of the changes when they were happening, but there was no doubt that he came out of the school completely different than from when he walked in. He was as small as a toddler, thin to the point where he questioned if he even still had bones anymore, and a solid color of white fabric for skin with tasteful lace patterns all over.<br />
<br />
The closer that Dan got to his house, the more some changes happened. Dan’s head sunk down even further, and his mouth began to widen, his body almost dividing into two distinct sections. Soon, his clothes, which had changed and remained on him throughout the day started to wither away. Then he struggled to even walk, as his limbs became nothing but thin straps, his hands eventually merging and his private parts melding into him.<br />
<br />
Because his movement was restricted, Dan moved really slowly. He wasn’t even halfway to his house, and he was practically crawling with only 15 minutes until his sister’s party.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt himself effortlessly picked up. His body seemed hang from a woman’s arm. He realized at this point how small and thin he really was.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, he was at his house. During that time, Dan felt as his mouth basically took over most of what remained of his body, spreading much wider than a human mouth should.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, I have to get ready,&quot; said a familiar voice. Was that Lilly’s? She walked in.<br />
<br />
Dan couldn’t see much, but you could tell that the party at your house was unlike any Dan has ever seen. He could hear music he has never heard before, chatter from female members of his family as they were casting spells. The glimpses he had from male family members appeared to be much more different than he was used to seeing. They were mythological and fantasy creatures as opposed to being the humans Dan thought they were.</p>
