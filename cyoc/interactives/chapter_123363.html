<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rain starts coming down just as the Lincoln Town Car parks outside the modest house on the semi-secluded street. Looking outside of the car’s windows; Spencer can see that her father’s car is in the driveway, her mother’s car was not present leading the teenage girl to wonder if both parents went out together with their newborn son in tow.<br />
<br />
“Well someone is home at least,” Benton speaking as a porch light is turned on; “or are your lights on timers Spencer?”<br />
“No timers,” Spencer mulling whether to get out or not; “guess my dad is home still. His car is in the driveway.”<br />
“Well lets go then,” Frieda reaching beyond Spencer and opening the door.<br />
“Wait,” Benton turning to look in the back seat; “you’re not going anywhere Frieda. It’s raining outside.”<br />
“Since when have I ever been afraid of rain,” Frieda commenting; “if it lets up come and pick me up. Other than that, bye.”<br />
<br />
Benton looks on stunned as Frieda practically pushed Spencer out of the car and followed after her. Both running to the front door of the Lawson house. Seeing the two disappear inside, the were-panther sighs as he slowly drives away back the Knight Estate.<br />
“Now how am I going to tell this to Amanda,” Benton muttering as he stops at an intersection. Looking at the road and the street running perpendicular to the one he was on; Benton opts to make a right hand turn, heading towards his brother’s place instead of turning left which would take him straight to his large mansion.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“What the hell was that for,” Spencer looking at Frieda as they both got indoors; “why push me out of the car?”<br />
“Because I don’t want to be stuck up at the estate all alone in this gloomy weather,” Frieda answering; “that is what would have happen after you got out of the town car.”<br />
 “You can always call me,” Spencer kicking off her shoes; “and there is skype.”<br />
“It’s not the same,” Frieda sighing; “and I don’t want our time together to be limited to just before school starts, the few minutes after school and the weekend.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t want to be alone in bed.”<br />
Both girls look towards the sound of the voice to see a large black furred werewolf standing in the kitchen. In the crook of his furry arm was a small infant child peacefully sleeping; his meaty paw acting as a seat while his other paw was holding onto a bottle with a nipple on top.<br />
“It’s true,” Evan putting the bottle down; “Frieda you are displaying the same look Maggie had whenever I was on deployment. And that was quite often,” Evan looking at his daughter; “give me a moment to put junior back in his crib.”<br />
<br />
Where is mom,” Spencer speaking up but not too loudly so as not to wake her brother up.<br />
“She went to pick a few things up at the store,” Evan answering after leaving the nursery; “that was an hour ago so she will be back soon.”<br />
“Let’s put our bags upstairs Frieda,” Spencer speaking; “we’ll play some video games for a bit.”<br />
“Not unless you have homework,” Evan staring at his daughter; “use the dining room table while I keep an eye on the roast in the oven.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Lila slowly got up from the sofa at the sound of the doorbell; with the rain coming down steadily for the past twenty minutes, the pregnant were-tigress was wondering who could be calling. Knowing that her husband Lance was at the Elder Council building; she got a call from him earlier stating that it was going to be one of those long sessions. Normally, Lila would also be there to volunteer and help out as the council discussed and debated over the current issue. But being three months pregnant, Lila was unable to help and as such could not shift into her fursona until after she gives birth.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Lila was surprised to see Benton outside. With the rain cascading down on to him and drenching his head, Lila just stepped aside so he can quickly enter.<br />
“Lance isn’t here,” Lila closing the door.<br />
“Is he still at the gazette,” Benton turning around to look at his sister in-law.<br />
“At the council building,” Lila answering; “he has been there since this morning. It’s an emergency session from what he told me.”<br />
<br />
Benton closes his eyes for a moment. Thinking of the days when he was the were-panther rep and recalling several times when he had to begrudgingly cancel and reschedule appointments because of council business. Since being removed after his violent outburst at Tachibana Enterprises main office in Moon Lake, Benton has not had to worry in regards to that responsibility. Knowing that Lance is only the were-panther rep until Frieda is twenty one, Benton just sighs as the one person he wanted to talk to was currently unavailable.<br />
<br />
“You want to wait for him,” Lila looking at the man wearing a damp suit.<br />
“I could,” Benton responding; “but Amanda is expecting me back home soon. With Frieda in tow.”<br />
“Yet judging by the tone of your voice,” Lila looking at Benton; “that last part is not a possibility?”<br />
“Not without damaging the relationship I have established with Frieda,” Benton sighing; “She ups and runs out of the town car just as we arrive to drop Spencer off at her place. Right at the same time the rain falls.”<br />
 “Can’t help you there,” Lila chuckling quietly to herself; “and I doubt Lance would be able to provide you with any insight either. With us expecting our first child,” Lila rubbing her belly; “it be us asking you for advice on child rearing.”<br />
“Oh no no no, “Benton shaking his head; “I’m poor choice to ask for advice in regards to that. A poor choice indeed,” Benton displaying an expression of shock and bewilderment; “I won’t deny I made mistakes with Frieda. Mistakes I don’t want to pass off to anyone.”<br />
“Well,” Lila chuckling; “our other option is to ask my brother and his wife Ester. But with a daughter and twin boys under his belt; I’m not keen on that happening to me. More so since the boys are only a year younger than Cindy.”<br />
“What do you mean,” Benton looking at Lila; “about that happening to you.”<br />
<br />
Lila was silent for a moment before heading to the living room to grab a photo album. Flipping to the pages before pulling out a picture and handing it to Benton.<br />
“That is what Ester looked like before she married my younger brother,” Lila speaking; “stacked and well-toned like any other were.”<br />
“Shit,” Benton looking stunned; “what happened?”<br />
“After Cindy was born,” Lila taking the photo and putting it back; “Rick and Ester were overjoyed. So much they didn’t exactly wait around if you know what I mean.”<br />
“Amanda and I never waited around after Frieda was born,” Benton looking sheepish; “we were rutting even while Frieda was still nursing.”<br />
“Yet,” Lila interrupting; “Amanda was back on her were-birth control pills. Ester kind of forgot and got pregnant three months after Cindy was born. Nine months later Jasper and Yogi came along and Ester’s figure suffered as a result. There is a reason why the doctors have stated that a couple has to wait a couple of years between pregnancies. Rick and Ester learned that the hard way.”<br />
“But surely if Ester didn’t give birth to twins,” Benton responding; “she wouldn’t look as haggard as she does now.”<br />
“It’s possible,” Lila putting the album away; “we’ll never know though.”<br />
<br />
Benton thought about what was just said for a moment. Thinking that he would need to have a chat with Frieda about today and other matters as soon as the two are together. Putting such thoughts aside for the moment, Benton thought of something else.<br />
“Since Lance is not expected to be back anytime soon; you want to head over to the estate? I doubt eating alone is something you are looking forward to.”<br />
“Don’t expect me to keep my hands off the parmesan crisps,” Lila lighting up at the thought of Ethel’s cooking; “regardless if they are your favorite.”<br />
“I think it’s some type of stuffed pasta for dinner tonight,” Benton responding as Lila gets a coat; “I’ll let Amanda know you are coming over. I suppose you’ll contact Lance just so he doesn’t get worried over you.”</p>
