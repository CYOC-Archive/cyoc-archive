<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Unified Materials Corporation&#39;s corporate campus is under quarantine due to a confirmed case of SkinSplit on site. Public officials recommend avoiding the area. All present on site will be quarantined until tested. The state health department asks that friends and family of those quarantined contact their loved ones directly as they should have their cell phones during quarantine, and not to contact the state SkinSplit hotline.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Stephanie Morgan listened with excitement, this was the first outbreak in their town. The dark haired waif decided to risk being a few minutes late to work and see how close she could get to the UMC building. Maybe she could even get to see one of the new amazonian rubber felines. She was salaried, so it wasn&#39;t like she punched in and out, but since she had just started two weeks earlier it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea to be late. <br />
<br />
Morgan (as she refused to use her first name) was twenty four, single, and had just started a new job as a software developer. She suspected her gender and being openly lesbian had helped her land the job in the male dominated tech industry. Her looks might have helped her further make her &#39;diversity hire&#39; case; she had embraced goth style and culture. Lean, pale, and fit; she kept her black hair buzzed to a short fuzz. This plus her black lipstick, perpetual frown, and sharp cheekbones made her a pretty good ringer for the Marvel Character Negasonic Warhead.<br />
<br />
She thought about the roads around the UMC site. The highway went right past it, and would be shut down. However the old rail bridge over the highway would likely be ignored and give her a perfect view. Even better, they would almost certainly be flying the transformed out to long term quarantine, and the best route to the airport would take them right under the bridge.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, and Morgan was standing on the rail bridge with binoculars in hand. A quarter mile away was a sea of flashing lights ringing the UMC office and factory. She found herself getting wet as she thought about what was happening inside.<br />
<br />
The SWAT team would have used liquid nitrogen sprayers to isolate the transformed. While SkinSplit cats were mountains of rubber skinned muscle, and far tougher than any other living creature, they hated cold. It hurt them, and made them stiff and sluggish. The accepted practice for capturing the latex amazons was to herd them into one place with liquid nitrogen sprayers, and then literally roll in a few cases of cheap vodka. The big brutish bimbo cats loved to drink and despite their altered chemistry, could (and would) drink and fuck until they passed out. Right now there was almost certainly a drunken sapphic feline orgy somewhere in that building.<br />
<br />
Even more of a turn on to Morgan is what was happening to everyone else. There were no non-invasive tests for SkinSplit, and until they transformed there were often no symptoms. The tried and true method was a little cut or needle prick, and see if a giant horny rubber fuckbeast burst out. Everyone in the building would be given a chance to see if they were infected. Refuse and be sent to an isolation camp. Those who accepted testing would be put in a secure room with a pin or tack on the table. They would have to prick their own finger and draw a drop of blood to prove they were not infected. Those who were unknowingly carrying the virus would instead look in horror as their hand was torn apart from the side as Cat Scratch Fever quickly remade them, body and soul. Her fingers slid down inside her jeans and panties to her wet and ready sex.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, she could see three large cattle trucks being backed up to the doors. Armored figures began hauling out the mostly unconscious transformees. Morgan wished she had better binoculars, but even at a distance she eyed up their hulking muscular forms. Most of them were feline, but she did see an azure color fox in the mix. All were huge, starting at well over seven feet if they had been standing, with very fertile figures. Wide hips, plump asses, and huge tits were universal. Their skin shone in the morning sun, with a rainbow of  bright hues.<br />
<br />
Morgan was glad she had worn her latex panties, the rubber would prevent her arousal from soaking through her jeans and making things awkward at work. She desperately wanted to be one of those beasts, to be a living embodiment of physical power and feminine sexuality. To live her latex fetish, and be forever smooth and shiny. Every morning she pricked her palm, hoping a huge rubber paw would burst out, tearing her pale skin into tatters. <br />
<br />
The trucks rolled out and onto the highway. She had been right, they would be going to the airport and pass right under her. She positioned herself for a better view, the cattle trucks they had improvised for transit had openings where she might be able to get a close up glimpse as they passed under.<br />
<br />
She leaned over the guard rail as they passed under her. A gust of air blew up as the big trucks rolled past.<br />
<br />
She saw a small piece of something fly out of the last truck. It floated in the air, coming to rest on the rail bridge.<br />
<br />
She ran over and picked it up. It was about one square inch in area, a slightly damp irregular strip of pinkish rubbery material. Turning it over, she realized what it was. The other side was normal human skin, she could see the pores and even a small strand of hair. It was part of one of the creatures&#39; old human bodies from which they had burst forth. It also meant the dampness on the pink rubbery inside was absolutely swarming with the virus.<br />
<br />
Morgan didn&#39;t hesitate, she licked it. Just to be sure, she put it in her mouth and sucked on it. <br />
<br />
Knowing the risk of discovery, she quickly returned to her car and started driving. She put the skin scrap in her water bottle at the first red light.<br />
<br />
This was better than she could have dreamed. The virus worked extremely fast, she was almost certainly already fully infected - ready to be reborn as a sexy beast at the slightest cut or prick. A big part of her wanted to pull her knife out of the glove box, and free herself immediately from the drudgery and responsibilities of her human existence. But she stopped herself, she could wait. There was a huge thrill of knowing her fate was sealed and it was only a matter of time. Perhaps she could do more with this...<br />
<br />
Her mind focused on her new fate, she drove on autopilot towards work. She laughed as Pandora started playing Powerwolf&#39;s &#39;Blessed and Possessed&#39;.</p>
