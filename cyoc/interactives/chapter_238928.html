<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Everything should be good to go for you, Mrs. Renee-Argenté,&quot; Olympe said to Juliet as she and Raoul emerged from one of the changing rooms at the hotel in Paris that the reception had been at, &quot;Violet and I can handle estate&#39;s affairs and things shouldn&#39;t be too hectic. Even with Christmas coming up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet smiled to her and noted Charles waving to both her and Raoul from beside his own father. The wedding had gone quite well, and while some of the scheduling had been hectic, once things were in order, neither Juliet nor Raoul could complain. A part of her would have hoped to have things closer to home, as the chateau or the local church weren&#39;t bad venues. And while Raoul&#39;s work and orders did come from Paris, that didn&#39;t mean he was unaware of the charms the local area around France&#39;s Animalian colony had. But Notre Dame was still a landmark, and it was an honor to be allowed have it in. At the same time, there had been assurances made that those that had been instructing Juan to get his degrees and certification would help Juan with what he termed &quot;student teaching&quot; handle the next few days at the school before the students would have the option to either stay at the chateau or return home for Christmas. <br />
<br />
Charles had voiced wishing to protect the &quot;Lady Juliet&quot; and her &quot;Lord Raoul,&quot; ever showing his fascination with the tales and images of chivalry and knighthood. It amused Juliet, because of her family&#39;s heritage that was connected to the nobility in France&#39;s past, even though they lost the power that came with it after the Revolution. It amused Raoul, as he was staunchly loyal to the Republic, and saw Charles&#39; stances as more of one who could see the kindness in Juliet and looked up to her as such. Raoul promised him that they would be fine, and that Charles&#39; real task would be to remain attentive and kind to his classmates and protect his family over Christmas.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Juliet answered and gave a smile, &quot;we should be back before Christmas break starts... but if not, Joyeux Noel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Olympe smiled as Raoul approached and kissed Juliet on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Not too far away, Countess Irena de Vasconcellos were coming from the area of the reception hall where she and her husband had been dining on their salad and enjoying the lettuce and olives in it. Lopez came alongside her as Juliet parted company from Olympe.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look well, Madam Mrs. Renee-Argenté,&quot; Irena said with a smile, &quot;I trust all is clear for a memorable wedding night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am...&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;for Raoul will become an Animalian...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will both be happy,&quot; Raoul answered, &quot;and for me... it will be an opportunity to have some time off. Which will be good for these personal matters. As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re also aware...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Pyrenean Ibex Animalians smiled knowingly. They had not told anyone, but they had been working on their own personal matters already when Irena came into season in late September. She wasn&#39;t showing, yet, but she and Lopez were expecting a little one to arrive sometime in 2025. The two of them were well aware of these things that related to private matters, and thus why they&#39;d offered Juliet to at least spend her wedding night at Costa de Cabra. It would ensure a more private conversion, since Juliet&#39;s older wards had been her students for years and not all had gone to college. It was where Irena had told Juliet that it was likely that there would be cheers echoing through Juliet&#39;s chateau if Raoul&#39;s conversion were to be done there. Irena could provide a more private setting, and one that would likely be a bit warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Irena gave a knowing smile, and privately figuring on what would then happen when Juliet went into heat in the spring, when Red Foxes normally did. Would she and Raoul start their own family then as well? &quot;But we&#39;d best be going. The distance isn&#39;t super far, and the flight isn&#39;t long... but it would be best to head out before something comes up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Juliet nodded, &quot;and we do have our affairs in order...&quot;<br />
<br />
Raoul smiled and squeezed Juliet&#39;s hand, while they then moved to follow Irena out...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The flight to Costa de Cabra was relatively quick from Paris, and Raoul did find the area warmer, even as the sun began to set after the plane landed at the airport for the Spanish city that Irena&#39;s villa and related colony grounds was a part of. A part of him wouldn&#39;t mind actually staying in Spain for the duration of the honeymoon with Juliet. For while he&#39;d had occasional moments to travel in the past, a lot of his own work for the French government often did keep him busy and thus his vacations were few and far between. He did however know bits of Spain&#39;s history that included long periods in the Medieval period where they were under Islamic rule. And while Charles Martel had saved the Franks from that political fall, Spain had remained under Islamic rule for years and it took time for the peninsula to be reclaimed... or reconquered by the Spanish Christians<br />
<br />
Raoul also knew that with that extensive history came a fairly decent sized cultural impact, as while various Muslim kingdoms were ultimately forced out of Spain, it took time. They ruled at least part of the peninsula from the early 700s into the late 1400s to early 1500s. That had to have provided a lengthy period of influence on culture, architecture, and even learning, even outside the Muslim kingdom in Spain. After all, trade and learning were not things that magically appeared in the twentieth century. To varying degrees, even in the Medieval world, there was international trade and diplomatic relations. But Raoul was not good enough on Spanish history to know what parts of Muslim rule survived the &quot;reconquest&quot; and thus couldn&#39;t know on what influence might have been had in the area around the part of Spain where Costa de Cabra was.<br />
<br />
It was something he could have wished he knew more on. Knowing that would give him something to compare to the stories his own parents had told him on their role in France&#39;s rule in Algeria and the service that lasted through to the end of French rule in Algeria. He&#39;d stories on how the region was exotic and over time had mixtures of both France and Algeria as a result of the efforts at colonization that had been there in the 1800s. But, for the moment, that wasn&#39;t on the agenda, and to a great degree, Raoul agreed with that. Juliet was smart and kind, protective, and caring. Her dedication to education and helping those that were confronted by mental disabilities was impressive and had been a big part of what had drawn him to her, even as an official in France&#39;s education ministry. Now as husband and wife, they would have the opportunity for so much more... and he was looking forward to the conversion.<br />
<br />
Though, as Irena escorted Juliet to the medical wing of her villa, Lopez escorted Raoul to the guest room that the two of them would have for the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t... shouldn&#39;t I be there for her?&quot; Raoul wondered as Lopez opened the door and allowed him to enter the room, and placing the bags on a chair that was along a fair wall. He then backtracked through to an end table by the bed and turned on the electric lamp that was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a shot... and one that would make the Animalia Virus in her system infectious once more,&quot; Lopez answered, &quot;you don&#39;t need to be there for the shot... and given that this is your wedding night, I&#39;d assume you&#39;d rather have it here than in a hospital room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right, there,&quot; Raoul managed, &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Lopez answered with a smile and then left the room.<br />
<br />
That left Raoul to pace the room for a few moments while he then waited. He assumed that Irena would escort Juliet to him, as that had been part of what had been discussed at dinner. It wasn&#39;t as ornate as what had been there at the reception in Paris, but Raoul also knew more than anyone that the government was trying to put on something of a show to draw attention away from the standard chaos that permeated French politics. At the same time, Raoul also wasn&#39;t one to really care about the food on his plate. He&#39;d come from a decent family, but they&#39;d also lacked the historic wealth that Juliet&#39;s family had, so he could easily accept food that wasn&#39;t ornate. Juliet had accepted it too, though, Raoul also remembered both of them staring into the eyes of the other as they ate dinner and had barely noticed Irena and Lopez smiling at each other at the time.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Raoul sat down on the bed and set about taking his shoes off. They weren&#39;t uncomfortable and were different from the formal shoes that he&#39;d worn with his tux for the wedding, but that didn&#39;t mean they were something he&#39;d be able to be comfortable in for a long period of time. Raoul also had the recognition that as an Animalian, hed likely be unable to wear those shoes again. In fact, much of his clothing, or at least his pants, would need to be different. That brought a small smile to his lips as the door to the room opened and Juliet entered. She entered in the same soft blue dress that she&#39;d changed out of her wedding dress for. The lace had been interesting, but he&#39;d known enough that things like wedding dresses weren&#39;t something that worked well with travel. He also suspected that the lace, itself, offered to many potential openings that would tug at Juliet&#39;s fur when she moved, and thus why a more solid white underdress had been fashioned to fit under the outer lace dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting ready...&quot; Juliet said softly as she noted Raoul&#39;s bare feet and his socks and shoes on the floor near the bed as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I couldn&#39;t wear my old shoes and become a digitigrade Animalian, could I?&quot; Raoul asked back, trying to put a slight teasing edge to his voice and relaxed a bit when he saw Juliet smile, &quot;though... I would add that you remain as beautiful as ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juliet smiled as Raoul approached her and the two of them hugged. It felt good to be close to him and for the moment not having work or other emergencies to interrupt them, &quot;and you are correct. Human shoes would not fit a Fox Animalian. Though... neither will your pants... but with this being our wedding night, that can be dealt with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet&#39;s hand&#39;s drifted down to Raoul&#39;s belt buckle as he reached her. Some of the speed with which it was removed told Raoul that in a way, he wasn&#39;t the only one that had been waiting. He ran his fingers through the fur on checks and carefully moving them in the direction in which the fur lay. It tickled the skin on his hands a bit as Juliet moved on to undoing his pants as well, but in a way, he didn&#39;t mind. He saw Juliet smile with happiness and that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you&#39;re as eager as I am,&quot; Raoul said carefully, &quot;I only hope I will be... good enough for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are,&quot; Juliet answered him, &quot;and yes, I am eager.&quot;<br />
<br />
And as his pants fell to the floor and he stepped out of them, Juliet leaned forward and kissed him. It was a bit awkward, given Raoul&#39;s flat Human face and Juliet&#39;s vulpine muzzle, but the passion was there, and it wasn&#39;t too long before both of their tongues were wrestling which each other. With that, the active Animalia Virus laced saliva in Juliet&#39;s mouth came into contact with Raoul&#39;s tongue and absorbed into his own tongue and mouth. Some of it was helped along by the fair amount of his own saliva that was there. After that, things began to feel warm and that was what made Raoul come up for air.<br />
<br />
&quot;It begins,&quot; Juliet&#39;s smile remained, &quot;and you should feel no pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raoul wondered a bit as Juliet then lifted up his hand. He felt minor pulses in his muscles as she did so, but he couldn&#39;t be sure. Foxes were relatively small predators and even the largest species, the Red Fox, was not the top dog in any environment where a larger Canid was present or where a comparably sized Felid was present. As such, Raoul didn&#39;t expect to become all that musclebound. As looked to his hand as Juliet lifted it, he noted his fingernails pushing out into the stubby claws that matched Juliet&#39;s. Black fur was also growing on his hands. As he looked down, Raoul could also soon see similar black fur growing out on his nose, which was beginning to push forward. Running his tongue along his lengthening jaw, he could feel his molars sharpening and his canines lengthening.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happening,&quot; Raoul said slowly, it sounding a bit strange as his mouth and jaw altered with the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Juliet smiled, &quot;and you already look quite stunning. Dark black gloves for your hands and feet... and on your growing muzzle and ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raoul paused and found new muscle groups forming as his ears migrated toward the top of his head and became triangular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hair is all black, too,&quot; Juliet smiled, &quot;and fits in with the more silver fur around your eyes and legs... You are quite dashing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raoul paused to look down toward his feet. And there the growing black fur started at his toes and actually came up to his knees. From there, there was the standard sort of dark silver coloration that the silver phase of the Red Fox was known for. Behind him, he could also begin to feel his tail begin to grow out behind him. He also felt younger and more invigorated than he&#39;d felt in quite a while, likely the Animalia Virus&#39;s ability to bring the aged back into their physical prime.<br />
<br />
&quot;This does look good... and even feels good,&quot; Raoul said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about to get even better,&quot; Juliet spoke.<br />
<br />
Raoul looked up and watched Juliet slide out of her dress and letting it fall to the floor. It was at this point that Raoul found that Juliet wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time for your second dose, darling,&quot; Juliet said to him as Raoul felt a strong stirring between his legs.</p>
