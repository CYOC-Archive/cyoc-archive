<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After asking Daisuke to continue on with what he had planned and to keep an eye out for Benton Knight, Mrs. Tachibana returned to her private estate and gardens to greet her guests. She took a moment to speak with the servants and Skulk members who had greeted the pair before walking up to the shrine like gazebo in the center of the gardens. It&#39;s thin paper walls ruffling in the slight breeze as she opened the door and entered.<br />
<br />
Seated before the table, the old man and younger a like rose to bow formally to Akane. She smiled and bowed in return, &quot;Please, you are my guests. You honor me but please, sit.&quot; After the two returned to their seats, she sat as well, &quot;Has everything been satisfactory, honored ones?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man smiled, &quot;It is you who honor us, Tachibana-sama...&quot; She held up a paw and smiled, &quot;Please, just Akane here. You are old allies of the Skulk and my guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
He bows again with a nods, &quot;Then, Akane. Thank you for your generosity in receiving us. I am Far Huojin of the Báih&#468; and the current holder of the title &#39;X&#299; F&#257;ng Bái H&#468;&#39;. Our clans have history. It is good to see that memory of my father&#39;s words have not faded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane was surprised that this man, even though a were-tiger, could be so old as to be the son of the one who saved her ancestor&#39;s family. She nodded, &quot;The story and promise has been passed down from generation to generation, despite our own fleeing of our homeland. That title is &#39;While Tiger of the West&#39;, is it not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Far Houjin nods, &quot;Yes. It is what we call the one who carries the will and incarnation of our Ancestor. It is the...title of leadership in a way of our clan.&quot; She nods, &quot;I understand. What reason has brought you so far and at such a time?&quot; Far looks to his grandson and motions him to speak, &quot;That is a tale best told by another for it involved him closely...&quot;<br />
<br />
The young Chinese american man cleared his throat and nodded to his grandfather. &#39;More like boy from his appearance, he can&#39;t be much past 19 or 20&#39; she thought to herself. He speaks with a respectful tone as he says, &quot;Tachibana-sama, I am Kai H&#468; Wáng. Please, you may call me Kai. My father started the Wáng Technological Consortium.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane smiled, &quot;Triumphant Tiger King? Your parents had high hopes for you, it seems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai was surprised she was able to translate his name but he blushed and looked down at the table, &quot;I hope you do not take it too offensive and grandoise. We cannot help what names our parents give us.&quot; She nodded, &quot;This is truth, young one. Please continue.&quot; Kai nods, &quot;As you will, Tachibana-sama. The clan of the White Tiger is small. It has never been large and we do not grow more numerous very easily but are blessed with great longivity as I am sure you understand seeing my grandfather before you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Far just chuckled to himself before speaking, &quot;You are also shifting the tip of your rapier, Akane. Do not think that though my eyes have almost failed that I do not see more clearly than those who eyes are young and unclouded. You recognized the name and business immedately. Please ask what it is that sprang to your mind before we go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane sighed, &quot;It is true. I was looking over your consortium today with all the pressure Brenton Knight has been putting on acquiring businesses we had interests in. I had no idea the Wang Consortium was...related to the old allies of my Skulk. I would have contacted you sooner. If this about that though...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai took it upon himself to answer, &quot;No.&quot; It was not loud but it was firm and unwavering. &quot;We do not do business with those who cannot honor their own agreements... Much less those who commit murder!&quot;<br />
<br />
Far put a hand on Kai&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Go easy, child...Tempt not the Tiger&#39;s rage in the house of friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai took a moment and a deep breath before bowing humbly to Akane, &quot;A thousand apologies, Tachibana-sama. I did not mean to speak in anger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane laughed softly, &quot;I have raised many children. But few so respectful. A thousand apologies you request and I give them freely.&quot; There was something charming about this young man that she found she liked. Not only handsome but thoughtful and respectful. Maybe manners were not as lost in this world as she thought. &quot;But without the anger, would you explain further what you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai nods, &quot;Mister Knight requested my father&#39;s help with his interests. He contracted my father and my father saw no reason not to accept it. He worked for him for over ten years, helping him to set up a network of international computer systems, video surveillance of his work places, warehouses, etc. Every aspect of the Knight&#39;s corporate and financial information uses the systems my father built for him. None guards his domain better than the Tiger. If you wish a place secure from normals and weres alike, there are none better than we. But, we did not know his lust for power and privilege then. However we learned. The more we assisted him, the more he demanded. The less respectful he became and the more convinced of money&#39;s power alone he became.&quot;<br />
<br />
Far sighs softly, &quot;To greed, obtaining more is like drinking salt water; it only makes the thirst worse. In a way, I pity the man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai says, &quot;I cannot. For when my father spoke to him, as a friend, to attempt to bring him back from the dark place he was going.. much less to take up arms against an old friend like the Tachibanas... he was met with a snake instead. That man is has a hole in his heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane frowns, &quot;And that is why you are here? Because of Knight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai says, &quot;In part. I wish to offer you an exchange. And to ask a favor.&quot; Akane nods and motions for him to continue. Kai retrieves from his pocket a small USB thumbdrive. &quot;I have here information that can aide you. Information that can bring the entire Knight&#39;s empire to it&#39;s knees. However, the methods in which I obtained it is not legal by the strictest of senses. It was compiled from notes my father made while working for Mr. Knight. Passcodes, infrastructure, etc. So I know you cannot use it overtly. However it will allow you to avoid his sight and move unseen. In return, I ask that you aide us in bringing an end to Benton Knight&#39;s plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane looks at the small plastic amalgamation of metal. &quot;And the favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai looks down, blushing, &quot;See that the dynasty passes to his daughter, Frieda Knight. Help her file a writ of emancipation as well as use the information we&#39;ve helped provide you with to take on her rightful throne.&quot;<br />
<br />
Far chuckles, &quot;My grandson worked with the Knights himself a few times. He is older than she but rather smitten thought honor will not allow him to approach her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai clears his throat, &quot;My personal feelings aside, she is a wise young adult and capable of handling the situation. She treats her people well and inspires loyalty in those who work for her. She is.. like an honorable empress. I wish to see her happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Far looks to Akane, &quot;But, we ask this not just for ourselves, I agreed to assist my grandson in this because I believe it best for my ancient allies...and for world that my grandson&#39;s children and their children...will inhabit. Let there be war in our days that our children are spared it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane picks up the thumbdrive and stands, bowing, &quot;I will consider all you have said. I can make no promises immediately but I will see what can be done and speak with you again. Please spend the night as my guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two weretigers stand and bow in return, accepting her invitation. After the two had gone, Akane allowed herself a sigh and to put a hand to her eyes, rubbing them softly as she thought. &#39;Knowing what I do of that clan... If we don&#39;t do something to assist, Benton will lose more than just his financial standing. A tiger&#39;s anger is no easily cooled, despite the kind words...&#39;<br />
<br />
Akane picked up her cellphone and started making calls. This would have been handled very delicately.</p>
