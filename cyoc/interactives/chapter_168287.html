<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick had tried to run away from the fruit men. But he was finally chased by the farmer, a mysterious man who leads these people.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we going to do with him?&quot; A fruit man asked to his boss. &quot;Do we feed him with some fruits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this kid won&#39;t be cooperative. If we turn him into a fruit man he could become a real pain in the ass.&quot; The farmer replied as he lead his people and their prisoner inside a house. &quot;No, I have a special plan for this boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go! Mfff.&quot; Patrick was trying to get free, but it was useless. The fruit men tied him by his wrist and ankles to an old bed while the farmer put a sock in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been working on a special product and you have arrived at the perfect time to test it, boy.&quot; The farmer took a vial with a shiny purple liquid inside it. Patrick&#39;s eyes were tearing. What destiny could be worse than becoming into a fruit man? He was totally terrified.<br />
<br />
The farmer took the sock out of Patrick&#39;s mouth and forced him to drink the purple thing. Patrick tried to spit, to puke, but it was useless. He can feel it going through his throat. All of the sudden his mind became dizzy, the world around him was spinning and blur. He can&#39;t recognize what was happening except for some creepy laughs that he can hear and then he fainted.<br />
<br />
Patrick woke up a few hours later, his head was hurting as hell but it wasn&#39;t as bad as before. He noticed that he was alone now. The farmer and his fruit men weren&#39;t around. He tried to move but he was still tied to the old mattress, however he felt some relief that he hadn&#39;t changed at all. No green skin nor fruits replacing his genitals like Ryan.<br />
<br />
After looking around for a moment, he tried to get free but any move he made didn&#39;t do anything against the tight ropes around his wrist and ankles. He tried to ask for help, but instead he discovered something that he hadn&#39;t noticed before.<br />
<br />
His mouth was full with a big green tube, like a giant vine, and it was feeding him with an extra sweet substance. How didn&#39;t he notice it before? He started to look for the end of the vine and he freaked out when he saw that it was attached to a giant berry. He wanted to scream but for some reason he was enjoying it. The flavor was so good that he can&#39;t stop drinking.<br />
<br />
Several hours later, the farmer and a fruit man arrived to check the progress on Patrick. The boy&#39;s belly was totally swollen up by now and his arms and legs were getting thicker and thicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; The farmer smiled as he touched the boy&#39;s swollen cheeks. &quot;He will be done by tomorrow! Ben, take his clothes away so I can have a better look of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fruit man took a knife and ripped Patrick&#39;s clothes off. He started with his jersey, then his shorts and finally his underwear. Ben was surprised that Patrick&#39;s genitals hasn&#39;t changed like the other fruit men. &quot;Why it didn&#39;t change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not like you. Don&#39;t you see it? His skin isn&#39;t turning green either, but a wonderful deep purple.&quot; The farmer said. &quot;He&#39;s the first one to experiment this! He&#39;s not becoming a fruit man but a total fruit instead!! Haha hahaha!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick was shocked after hearing that. He didn&#39;t want to be a fruit. It was a billion times worse than being a fruit man! He wanted to escape but then he remembered the wonderful liquid that was feeding him and he stayed quiet. &quot;P-please. I don&#39;t want to be a... a... a fruit.&quot; He managed to talk a little but he sounded so weak that he was ignored.<br />
<br />
After taking some measurements, the farmer and Ben leave Patrick alone again. The boy was terrified feeling how his body was filling in with more and more juice as time goes by. His belly was too big now that he can&#39;t see his legs anymore. It was as big as a beach ball. His nipples had disappeared and his skin didn&#39;t look human at all. He tried to move his arms and legs, but he felt so weak. He can&#39;t see his limbs but he can feel them big and heavy.<br />
<br />
Several hours later, the farmer arrived again with another fruit man. They untied him and pushed him outside the bed. He knew he was free, but he didn&#39;t try to run away. He was so heavy and full of juice that he can&#39;t feel his hands and feet anymore. If he could see them, he would be terrified of noticing that his arms and legs were getting sucked inside his berry body. He had become so big that he was taller than the men next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you done boy? Do you want me to take the vine out of your mouth?&quot; The farmer said as he put a hand on the vine that feed Patrick.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no. Please, I want more.&quot; Patrick&#39;s voice was so weak but still audible for the farmer who just smiled.<br />
<br />
After taking some more measurements, they leave Patrick alone again. It was too late and they turned off the lights, so Patrick was now alone in the darkness but he wasn&#39;t scared anymore. He was happily drinking his juice and becoming more and more big. His arms and legs had finally disappeared inside him and his hands and feet were the next ones. He didn&#39;t have a neck anymore and the hair on his head was falling off. It remains very little of Patrick&#39;s humanity right now.<br />
<br />
The next morning, the farmer arrived with a third fruit man to look at the boy. When he turned the lights on, he noticed that any trace of Patrick had disappeared. There wasn&#39;t any foot or hand, just a big round berry. Patrick&#39;s head had disappeared too, but the vine that fed him was still attached to the fruit with a few leaves where his face was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor boy.&quot; The fruit man said as he touched the juicy purple berry that was as tall as the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. He&#39;ll be a good fruit and will feed a lot of people.&quot; The farmer grinned. He took a knife and slice a little portion of the berry. &quot;Amazing! He&#39;s a total fruit in and out.&quot; He inspected the slice of fruit and then he wickedly grinned again. &quot;Don&#39;t you wanna taste it?&quot;</p>
