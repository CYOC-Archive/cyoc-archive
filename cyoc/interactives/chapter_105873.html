<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt, Bryan, David, Dan, and all the others were eventually brought into a giant auditorium along with what looked like hundreds if not thousands of other teen and young adult boys of varying ages. Bryam and David tried to stay close to each other, Matt and Dan were all far from each other. <br />
<br />
A big spotlight came on in the center of the stage as a big man in an Under Armor t shirt and pair of shorts. &quot;Can I have all of your attention!&quot; He shouted and everyone got quiet, all he did was shout and it was carried across the room even without the aid of a microphone. &quot;Hello my name is Mike Hill, I&#39;m the assistant director, or assistant coach, at this facility&quot; he said and some people looked confused while others were unphased. &quot;Now some of you might have been told we are a training camp, an athletics schools, a high intelligence school, and some of you might not have been told anything, just brought here&quot; he said that last part with a smirk. &quot;Well I don&#39;t mean to disappoint you but actually none of those are true, this place is what we like to call, The Compound&quot; he continued to give that cocky smile. <br />
<br />
He proceeded to explain what the compound was and that they were far from any town or city. And then he explained how their stay would work.<br />
&quot;You will be here for about a month, during that time you will be paired off and be assigned dorms. Your regimens will include training, some classes, some will be required for everyone and some will be specific for your personal programs. Don&#39;t bother trying to escape, we have multiple layers of security to stop anyone&quot; he explained. <br />
<br />
After his announcements everyone was confused and disoriented. They each got assigned to their dorms and were being watched carefully by the security teams. David and Bryan had ended up in the same room, Matt and Dan had ended up in the same room and would meet for the first time.<br />
***<br />
Matt and Dan had arrived at their dorm. <br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; was all Matt could say as he looked around at his situation. It was a single room with two twin beds, one against each wall. The walls were decorated with a mix of football and wrestling posters. In the center front of the room was a flat screen tv, viewable from either bed. In the corner to the left of the tv was a rather old looking computer, but blinking green lights suggested it was connected. Finally the room had one large window in between the two beds on the wall opposite the door and tv, it was big enough for an adult to fit through but there were no bars or chains, which terrified Matt because that meant the workers don&#39;t think it would matter if anyone got out the windows. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard rumors of a jock factory but I always liked to think they were nonsense, like a urban legend&quot; Dan said looking around and taking it all in. &quot;I&#39;m Dan by the way, kidnap victim&quot; he said nonchalantly, offering his hand to Matt. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m Matt, sports camp, well that&#39;s what my dad said but I think he knew exactly what this place was&quot; he shook Dan&#39;s hand. He decided if there was anyway out of here, his roommate might be his best bet.  After all Matt was 18 and Dan was 22, so despite being an adult legally, Dan still looked more mature and level headed to Matt.<br />
<br />
The two realized they had no clothes or luggage with them, Matt was taken right from dinner and Dan from right off the street. There was a Cabinet style dresser on each side of the room, and when opened they realized they were full of football jerseys, athletic shorts and lots of under armor  equipment. <br />
&quot;You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me&quot; Dan said with a sigh &quot;I&#39;ll just keep this on for now&quot; Dan said closing the dresser and laying down on his bed with a thud. Matt on the other hand tried desperately to use his cell phone, which wasn&#39;t even taken from him, only to realize there was no signal.<br />
***<br />
Bryan&#39;s and David got shoved into their dorm room roughly by a security guard. The door was closed but for a prison they didn&#39;t even bother to lock the door or bar the windows. The room was identical to Matt and Dan&#39;s in arrangement however instead of football and wrestling posters, this room was covered in basketball posters. Inside the dresser were sleevless basketball jerseys and basketball shorts. <br />
&quot;What is this? Why would a school be in on this?&quot; Bryan said almost gasping for air, having the beginning of a panic attack. <br />
&quot;Calm down, it&#39;s possible the schools were lied to also?&quot; David offered to try and comfort Bryan. That concept helped a little. Both Bryan and David found their cell phones didn&#39;t work, no signal, they couldn&#39;t even text each other and they were in the same room. Bryan tried the computer and while it did get internet it was heavily blocked by a program similar to the ones used in schools to keep people of non educational websites. This seemed to block everything except sports sites. Email and social media sites were blocked, of course, why did Bryan even bother. There had to be a way out of here to at least get far enough to get a signal, there just had to be.</p>
