<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors’s Note: while sexual acts are discussed/thought of. None are currently being acted on. Also in past stories I have flubbed with the ages of the Moon Lake’s cast of teenagers. In my previous chapter’s I have described my character John Shafer at age sixteen. This was a mistake. His correct age should be fourteen. The same age as Eric, Frieda and Julie. Thanks go to TheMaskedWriter for giving me the correct ages. Now on with that latest chapter<br />
<br />
Brian Walker was strutting about like a proud peacock. He had another after school session in sex-ed with Alyssa Cooper yesterday and just received a text for another class as it were; only this time it will be somewhere more private. What he doesn’t know is that Alyssa had already made arraignments for him to take his first steps in the shady industry that is politely referred to as escort service. Sitting at his usual table during lunch he is all but oblivious to Eric in his tight pants and black t-shirt next to a horny Frieda.<br />
<br />
“Take it easy Frieda,” Eric whispers, while fighting her from shoving her hand down his pants. “We’re next to the teachers table. Do you want them to catch us in the act?”<br />
“It’s not my fault,” Frieda pouts. “Your attire is making it hard to resist.”<br />
Eric manages to get her to stop so he can check his phone, “Spencer just texted.”<br />
“I didn’t get any message,” Frieda states while looking at her phone.<br />
“That’s because she sent it to me,” Eric responds. “It states,” he continues; “Eric I’m sending this to you only, incase Benton decides to monitor Frieda’s messages. Regardless of what is going on at her home. Tomorrow we are all ditching school to have a romp in the woods.” Eric puts down his cell phone. “There is also a couple of winking emoticons.”<br />
Frieda smiles, “That’s smart of her. But my father would get skinned by me if he tried to monitor my messages again.”<br />
“He’s already tried?” Eric asks.<br />
“Yep,” Frieda smiles. “It was one of the few times he was forced to concede in his attempt to mold me into an image of his choosing.” Frieda continues, “That and the fact that the conversations he read were nothing more than female issues.”<br />
“Female issues?”  Eric’s interest slightly piqued.<br />
Frieda grins and places Eric’s hand on her crotch, “Those kinds of female issues.”<br />
Eric’s face goes beat red as Frieda erupts into laughter. With both her hands out of sight from the teachers’ table, she goes back to trying to stuff her fingers down his pants; Eric futilely struggling while trying to eat lunch. Despite the drama currently going on at the Knight estate; Frieda is able to put it out of her mind despite the fact that she will soon be pick up from an exasperated mother and dealing with a possibly drunk dad.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Spencer was in her last class prior to lunch. While she knew Eric and Frieda, were together for their lunch; she still wished they could spend more time together then a few minutes before and after school. After managing to read Frieda’s text last period, Spencer decided to put forward a plan for all three to be together regardless of the consequences. Being adept to texting in class without the teacher noticing; Spence fires of a message to Eric.<br />
‘Eric I’m sending this to you only, incase Benton decides to monitor Frieda’s messages. Regardless of what is going on at her home. Tomorrow we are all ditching school to have a romp in the woods. Wink emoticon wink emoticon’<br />
<br />
She smiles as she hits send. While she still has the rest of the afternoon to go through, Spencer could hardly concentrate in class. All she could think is tearing off the Eric’s tight clothes while he ravages her in a secluded overgrown bush not far from her home. With her Grandfather Mike Lawson due to pick her and Eric up when school lets out; she just quietly counts the minutes while twirling her hair.<br />
<br />

<br />
Nate Anderson, Alex Ramsey, and Ben Twist are in the boy’s locker changing into their gym clothes. Despite the fact that the weather is rapidly heading into winter; the gym teacher felt it was still warm enough for a game of flag football. While Nate was quietly changing; Alex and Ben were clearly goofing off. Both being gay they couldn’t help themselves with playfully slapping each other’s ass as they changed. It was only by being admonished by the gym teacher to knock it off and save their antics for after school did Alex and Ben stop. Nate knew that when class was over and they were all in the shower that those two would be at it again. He smiles as he heads out to the schools multi-purpose field; leaving Alex and Ben alone with an impatient gym teacher.<br />
<br />

<br />
John Shafer was just about finishing his lunch during freshman lunch period when Principal Andrews approached him. While John was fourteen, he was just shy over six feet. With his height he would have no problem trying out and competing with the basketball team. But despite the fact that he had to take an after school job to help pay for bills his now jailed alcoholic mother never dealt with; John had little time for after school activities. Upon finding out from Sheriff Cooper that his father was a police officer for Seattle’s gang task force and left him what could be several million dollars which Sheriff Cooper is holding in trust until he turned eighteen; John’s outlook on life was looking a little better. While he still needed to keep his after school job to help his aunt out with the bills, John knew he needn’t worry about how to pay for college or university or even joining the military just to take advantage of the G.I. bill once he finished his service.<br />
<br />
Which is why John found it strange that the Principal wanted to talk to him regarding Julie Stovall. But after trying to tell the principal he didn’t know any more then what everyone else heard he found the real reason why the principal want to talk to him.<br />
<br />
“Of all the students that attend Moon Lake High John, you are the only one that lives closest to the Stovall house.” Principal Andrews continues, “While Julie is suspended from school, she still needs to complete class assignments and homework, so she doesn’t fall behind. If it would at all be possible could you come to the office after school to pick up all the material that Julie has so far missed, and take it to her home?”<br />
<br />
John knows he will be late for his job at the catering company he works for if he has to do this every day; so John phrases his response thusly; “I can’t do it every day sir. I have an after school job that I need to keep to help pay for bills.”<br />
“The whole town is aware of your mother’s problems,” Principal Andrews states; “I’m not asking you to do this daily; once a week should be sufficient. Plus bringing back her complete work; but that can be done on you way to school.”<br />
“I just need to bring back her completed work back to the office?” John asks.<br />
“Yes,” the principal responds; “I make sure it gets to her appropriate teachers.”<br />
John thinks for a few minutes; “Okay, since it’s once a week I’ll do it.”<br />
“Great,” Principal Andrews’s replies. “Be at the office after school to pick up Julie’s school work. Since this is Thursday I’ll also make sure it has Friday’s as well. And we’ll have you start doing this weekly each Friday afterwards.” Principal Andrew leaves the fourteen year old six foot tall werewolf to rush to his afternoon class.</p>
