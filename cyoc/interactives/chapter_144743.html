<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I flew over the library table and closed my sights on a guy reading alone. I took a closer look him. His hair is black and kept nice and short. His face has a slight squared chin with a hint of stubble. Judging from looks alone, he isn&#39;t that much tall for an adult. But what he lack in height, he regains in muscle mass. He may not be over-sculpted but I know he&#39;s packing meat inside that thick jacket.<br />
<br />
I floated back, readied myself and dashed straight through his body. There was the same darkness but it was a blur. In an instant, I came back to the light and into the world of the living.<br />
<br />
Henry was right behind me. I gave him the thumbs up sign to let him know that I&#39;m here. He grabbed my arms and led me through rooms after rooms. We reached a final door which lead to a desolate bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Henry asked. I was coughing and it feel like every air in my lungs has escaped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to breath.&quot; I replied with my new voice. I breathed deep. With time, I regained the energy to stand properly &quot;I think I&#39;m alright now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry looked up to me. I know those eyes of his. He&#39;s examining me with that curious look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember anything?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t explain it but my head is swamped with blurry imaged. If you get what I mean kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I get it. So how does it feel to be in a proper body? How long are you going to stay in that guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re speaking as if the librarian isn&#39;t a proper body.&quot; To be honest, there&#39;s some sense in his words. I feel disgusted to be in her body. &quot;But to answer your question, I feel amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I lefted my beefy arms and flexed them. &quot;My arms are strong and my belly,&quot; I lifted my shirt to reveal a slightly chubby belly. &quot;This boy right here is freaking hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry touched my belly and pat it with his palm. The sound of flesh being slapped on reverberated around the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you sure we&#39;re the only people here?&quot; I looked around but there seems to no one but us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I know this place. Only the staff and I know this place. And they don&#39;t use the bathroom the male&#39;s bathroom that much.&quot; Of course. From the moment I entered here, all I saw were female librarians. &quot;We&#39;re free to do anything in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry walked over to the door and locked it. &quot;Just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first thing I wanna do right now is to explore the rig. So I undressed my thick hoodie and the t-shirt underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If im going to stay in here. I might as well need to know what I really look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough. I&#39;d like to look at you as well. I&#39;ve never seen another guy naked before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry grabbed my pants and pulled it off. I pulled the remaining undergarment as well. In quite a convenient circumstance, this bathroom has a full body length mirror. My whole physical form is evident on the reflection in front of me.<br />
<br />
For one thing, this guy has tan lines across his body. The line that separates milky white from the hint of brown is as clear as day. &quot;Dang! My butt is so white.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Henry slipped my butt and squeezed his palm on my butt cheeks. I flinched from the sudden pressure and jumped from my spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to touch it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have told me first.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a quite unexpected occurance, I feel a pressure building up on my dick. It felt hard and painful. I looked the meat between my legs and saw it point in front of me. I was a ghost for so long that I forgot what a boner feels like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; Henry kneeled and admired my growing shaft. &quot;My dick dies this too in the morning or when I really need to pee. I&#39;ve never seen it this big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well if he lives up to 30, he&#39;s going to see larger ones. Maybe even thicker ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing here kid is called a boner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not morning so therefore you need to pee right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t think so. I never forgot the feeling of a full bladder and I don&#39;t know why. I died peeing my pants I guess. Nevertheless, there are other reasons why I&#39;m so hard right now. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because you slapped my butt. This guy is attracted to it I think.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Because I slapped your butt?&quot; Henry looked behind him and slapped his butt. He&#39;s probably waiting for his binder that isn&#39;t going to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not how you get a boner stupid.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But it happened to you.&quot; Henry slapped my butt again and I could another surge of pressure surging through my dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;I said don&#39;t do that.&quot; I said. &quot;Just because this guy likes it, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll like it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you get boners?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just look or think of sexy things. Like boobs and stuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Eww...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s how the world works kid. Now to get rid off this boner.&quot; <br />
<br />
I touched the shaft of my dick and pumped it up. The sense of pleasure frothed at the tip. I regret the way I forgot how good this feel. So I leaned on a wall and let the cold surface drag my skin. I bit my lips in pleasure as my fingers continue to explore my dick. One thing about humans is that they have buttons. And I seem to know how to press every single one. <br />
<br />
I tried to contain the next moan but the pleasure was too intense. &quot;Unghh... Ah.!&quot; I moaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening? Why are you doing that?&quot; Henry said. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is how you get rid of boners kid. Just stand and watch.&quot; <br />
<br />
With my free hand, it scoured the skin of my chest. It nipped my nipples and squeezed them slowly. It was a button that sent my hips jumping and my mouth yelping. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uaaaah...&quot; I moaned longer. A wet slick feeling slipped through my fingers. It&#39;s my pre-cum and I sure have lots of it. <br />
<br />
I continue to pump my dick. My fingers dance to match the speed of my heartbeat. I could feel it in my bones, in my muscle and in my skin. It&#39;s closing in. The heat of my seed spout out from my dick and sending my cum across the floor. <br />
<br />
The wave of pleasure hit me like tsunami. And with the force, I was pushed out of the guy&#39;s body. One moment, joy filled the very fabric of my being. In an instant, the cold replaced it. <br />
<br />
I looked below me and saw the college student rising from his spot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- wha?&quot; He said. His eyes screams shock with a hint of overwhelming confusion. &quot;What the fuck!? Where the fuck am I? And why the fuck am I naked?&quot; The guy looked at Henry. &quot;And who the fuck are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fuck! He&#39;s seen Henry. With great force, I returned back to the guy&#39;s body. The slab of body pushed outwards. I woke up to the sight of Henry&#39;s terrified face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I lost control over there for a sec.&quot; I said. Henry was silent. Shock is still coursing through his body. So I pulled him in and hugged him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s me.&quot; <br />
<br />
That seemed to wake him up from his senses. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was freaking scary.&quot; Henry said. &quot;You need practice.&quot; <br />
<br />
I sure do.<br />
<br />
I cleaned myself after that and went out the library. It&#39;s still a bit near the afternoon and I there&#39;s a lot to do.</p>
