<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We didn’t have to wait long to find out.  A minute later there was a knock on the door.  I opened the door and Scott and Carl walked in.  They had the same clothes on as well.  They looked eager and awake.  We all immediately looked to see the changes to their hair.  Scott’s hair had grown longer than mine as it was already touching his shoulders.  He was also having to brush it out of his eyes almost constantly.  It did seem to be changing to a darker, fuller color of brown, however.<br />
<br />
Carl’s black colored hair was not as long as mine or Scott’s.  What was different about his hair compared to ours is that his hair appeared to be acquiring a natural curl to it.  Our hair remained straight.  “Looks like you’ll stand out with that,” I said to him.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” he said.  “Who knows?”  I still couldn’t tell if he fully accepted the change as of yet.  <br />
<br />
“Everyone, let’s have some breakfast, and let’s do it quick, because we’ve got more pictures to take,” said Joyce.  She had been cooking a batch of bacon, eggs and toast big enough for all six of us.  We did indeed eat fairly quickly, mostly at the girls’ behest, so that a new round of pictures could be taken.<br />
<br />
They were a bit upset that there were no more changes other than our hair.  Rachel knew this would be the case, but she played along for the sake of Pam and Joyce.  “You guys are going to look so different by the end of the day,” Pam said in a somewhat taunting manner.<br />
<br />
“Well, we won’t be guys anymore,” said Scott.<br />
<br />
“I guess I should start calling you all girls, then,” she retorted.  Rachel and Joyce laughed along with Pam.  Scott shook his head with a smile.  I had to chuckle.  Carl didn’t react one way or the other.  <br />
<br />
“Seriously, though, we are going to have to show you three a lot,” said Joyce.  “All the things you’ll need to know in order to live as a woman.”<br />
<br />
“Such as?” asked Carl.<br />
<br />
“All kinds of things,” Joyce explained.  “Taking care of your skin and hair, shaving your legs, putting on makeup and using tampons.”<br />
<br />
“Tamp...” Carl started to say with a look of shock.  After a moment that look went away and he said, “Well, that’s true.”<br />
<br />
“Damn right it’s true,” said Pam.<br />
<br />
Joyce continued, “I think we’ll start with hair care.  Now Pam and Rachel have already tended to their hair this morning, unfortunately.  So which of you three wants to volunteer?”<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you show us with yours?” asked Scott.<br />
<br />
“Because,” said Joyce, “there’s no fun in that.  Joe, I think your hair is longest now, so you’re picked.”<br />
<br />
I shrugged my shoulders.  “Fine by me,” I said.  “What do you need me to do?”<br />
<br />
Joyce said, “Let’s make it simple.  Just come stick your head under the sink here.”  I did as Joyce instructed.  As soon as my head was in position, she turned on the faucet.  I almost jerked my head up into the faucet because the water was cold at first.  Joyce took control of my head and made sure that it was drenched with water.  She turned off the faucet and said, “We’ll skip shampooing because I think you should all now how to shampoo your hair.  Just remember you’ll have to start using more.  Oh, and you might want to start using conditioner if you don’t already.  You know what?  We’ll talk about that later.  Now just keep your head there for a sec.  Can someone get me a towel?”<br />
<br />
“I got it,” I heard Rachel say.  <br />
<br />
I began to feel a little discomforted.  I couldn’t quite figure out why, however.  It wasn’t because I was bent over the sink, though the sound of the water dripping out of my hair and into the metallic sink was getting annoying.  “Hurry up,” I called out when I sensed it was taking too long to retrieve a towel.  A couple seconds later and I felt something hit me in the back.<br />
<br />
“Hey!  I don’t know where everything is around here yet,” said Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” I apologized.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Joe, lift your head up slowly,” said Joyce.  Just as I was standing straight again, my vision was blocked by a towel being wrapped around my head.  Once again she took control of my head with her hands.  “Just move with me, dear.”  I let her direct me.  I was able to look at the floor and sensed she was moving me over to one of the couches in the living room.<br />
<br />
“Come on, girls,” said Pam.  “Your lesson is about to begin.”<br />
<br />
Joyce had me sit down, but she didn’t let me sit back against the couch.  “Obviously you know how to dry your hair, but when you have long hair it takes a lot more time and effort,” Joyce instructed.  “You can start with your normal towel drying like this.”  She forcefully rubbed the towel all around my head.  She used a lot more effort than I normally did when drying my hair.  A minute or so later she stopped.  “Now comes the part that’s new for you all.”  She took the towel off my head.  I saw that she had what I assumed to be Rachel’s hair dryer in her hand.  “Watch carefully,” she commanded.  She turned the hair dryer on and used it all over.  She also had a hairbrush that she used while she dried my hair.  “This is to make sure you hair doesn’t get tangled or dry wrong,” she explained.  “Trust me that you won’t enjoy the sensation of getting tangles out of your hair.”<br />
<br />
It took her about five minutes before she stopped.  “There, you’re finished,” she said.  She handed me the mirror.  I looked over myself.  I noticed that my hair was now touching my shoulders.  It seemed that perhaps the changes were accelerating.  Joyce turned to Scott and Carl and asked, “Anyone else want a free lesson?”<br />
<br />
“I’m good right now,” said Scott.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take one,” said Carl.  “But only if Pam helps me.”  We all looked surprised at this, especially Pam.<br />
<br />
Pam smiled slightly and said, “OK, I’ll help.”  She and Carl walked into the kitchen.  I was starting to wonder if something was connecting between them.  “I’ll shampoo it if you want,” she said.  “But I’ll be aggressive.”<br />
<br />
“Do your worst,” Carl dared.<br />
<br />
The rest of us remained in the living room while Pam washed Carl’s hair.  I heard Carl say “Ouch” a few times.  I wasn’t surprised that Pam took Carl up on his dare.  I wondered if Carl was actually enjoying it, however.<br />
<br />
The feeling of discomfort that began when I was in the kitchen continued.  I couldn’t figure out what was the cause, but it made me fidget in my seat.  After a few minutes of doing that, Rachel noticed.  “What’s wrong with you?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure,” I answered.  “Something.”<br />
<br />
Joyce stood up and said, “I have no idea why I’m still wearing this.”  She slid the garter belt off and tossed it onto the clothes pile.  “Wasn’t doing anything anymore,” she remarked.  Now she was truly naked from the waist down.  She ran her hands over her legs and then over her ass.  She had a confused look on her face.  “Huh,” she said.  “My skin feels smoother than it has in a few years.  And this,” she said as she squeezed her rear end,” feels a lot firmer than it did yesterday.<br />
<br />
“Ooh,” said Rachel as she walked over to Joyce.  “Sounds like you’re definitely getting younger.”  She glanced at Joyce’s ass and asked, “May I?”  Joyce gave her consent and Rachel ran her hands over Joyce’s ass.  “I think you’re right.  It looks great from here, too.”  Rachel glanced at me.  She smiled wickedly and asked, “Is this bothering you?”<br />
<br />
“No,” I answered while I continued to fidget.  “Why would it?”  I knew she was still trying to test me.  But I had bigger concerns at the moment.  The discomforting feeling had now grown unbearable.  I finally realized that it was coming from my hips.  My jeans were beginning to feel restrictive.  I realized that I had the urge to take them off because of the wish, but there was another reason.  They suddenly felt tighter around my hips and ass.  I fumbled at the button on my jeans because my fingers were thinner and my fingernails seemed a bit longer again.  “Here goes nothing,” I said.  I managed to unbutton the jeans and take them off.  They did not come off easily as they clung to my hips.  I really had to exert a good deal of force to get them past my hips and over my ass.  They slid off my legs quite easily.  I noticed that my legs appeared a bit thinner.  <br />
<br />
I stepped out of my jeans and threw them on the pile.  I admit I felt a little weird since I was now wearing only an undershirt and a pair of socks.  I was very much aware that my penis was exposed to everyone.  Just at that moment, Pam and Carl returned from the kitchen.  Carl took one look at me and immediately said, “Oh, put it away, Joe.”<br />
<br />
“No way I’m putting those jeans back on,” I said.  “If somehow this bothers anyone, tough.”  I began to run my hands over my hips and ass.  I was amazed at the smoothness of my skin.  But more than that I noticed that my hips were definitely wider and my ass was definitely rounder.  “This is feeling interesting,” I said.  <br />
<br />
Rachel walked over to me and also felt my changing parts.  “I like it,” she said.  Then she suddenly stopped feeling me up and looked uncomfortable as well.  In an instant she tore off her own pants and discarded them on the pile.  All that remained on her now was her bra and panties.  Without missing a beat she resumed examining my own body.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, the skin fest is starting,” Carl remarked as Pam began drying his hair.  <br />
<br />
At that moment, Scott stood up and unbuttoned his shirt.  He slid it off his shoulders and then removed his undershirt.  After he tossed that shirt on the pile, he replaced his regular shirt and re-buttoned it.  That shirt was noticeably looser on him now.  He still had his boxers on.<br />
<br />
Carl removed his socks and threw them on the pile just before Pam attacked his hair with the hair dryer.  Like Scott he still wore a pair of boxers and a shirt.  Carl’s hair didn’t require as much time to dry as mine.  I looked at him and I could swear he had a look of enjoyment on his face as Pam ran the hairbrush through his hair.<br />
<br />
When Pam was finished with his hair she looked around the room and took inventory of all of us.  She looked at my exposed penis and said, “No wonder you’ve never had a lot of girlfriends.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, ha ha,” I said.  “You know it’s been getting smaller.  Why don’t you take a few more pictures to find out?”<br />
<br />
“Too soon,” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand.  “I admire your adventurousness, Joe.  In fact…”  Her voice trailed off as she reached down to the bottom of her shirt.  In one swift movement she lifted her shirt up and off her body.  She was now topless.  “Someone had to be the first one to go shirtless,” she said.  She didn’t appear to be the least bit embarrassed of her exposed breasts.  She looked at them and said, “Huh.  I could swear they look…different.”<br />
<br />
“Bigger?” asked Rachel.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she said.  “Maybe.  Or maybe they’re just rounder or fuller.  I guess I’m getting into prime condition.”  Suddenly Pam looked at Carl.  Carl had been staring at her breasts from the instant she removed her shirt.  “I thought you didn’t like these,” she said as she teasingly ran her hands over her breasts.<br />
<br />
“I…um…well…they,” Carl stuttered like the dumbstruck person he presently was.<br />
<br />
“Here,” said Pam.  She walked in front of Carl and sat on his lap.  “Feel them,” she instructed as she took Carl’s wrists and place his hands on her breasts.  He didn’t do anything.  “Feel them,” she said forcefully.  This time Carl complied and he ran his hands over her breasts.  “Mmm,” Pam moaned lightly.  Carl immediately removed his hands.  “I didn’t say ‘stop,’” Pam scolded.<br />
<br />
“No, but I told myself to,” said Carl.<br />
<br />
“You’ll have your own to feel soon enough,” Pam teased.<br />
<br />
“What do you want to show us next?” I asked Joyce.</p>
