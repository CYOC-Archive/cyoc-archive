<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Think on it, that is an easy change to do before we begin the process of changing you into anthro wolf.” Said La Fay as Barbara nodded her head. <br />
<br />
“That is like a werewolf, correct?” inquired Barbara as Headmistress La Fay nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Werewolf is what humans called them but in truth unless they are using a magic charm to seam human they are naturally wolf creatures. Most people call them werewolves or werecats and the like. Officially they are called anthro but that is more of a legal thing.” Explained La Fay going off like the teacher she had been before becoming a headmistress. “See anthro is a wide range of creatures in this school, there are anthro wolves which is what you are becoming, kitsunes which are fox versions of the same thing, felines…and so on. It is a board term to cover a lot of animal human hybrid creature which is mostly humanoid with some animal features.” <br />
<br />
“I see…I guess I have a whole lot of new history to learn about.” Said Barbara <br />
<br />
“You do, but.” Confirmed La Fay as she stood up. “But that is why this school was founded, so please follow me.”<br />
<br />
They headed out the door and Barbara followed her out of the office and across campus again. Night was falling but she soon found herself in what looked to be an old stone building but turned out to be their medical school. <br />
<br />
What followed was something kin to a physical, the weighed her, measured her, took blood work but they also did a lot of measurements like her bust size, her arm length and so on. Finally, she sat on basically a hospital bed with an IV in her arm, dressed in only a white gown. <br />
<br />
“Alright, we have it set for a werewolf?” inquired a nurse who was a type of fawn, the IV bag was a giving off a strange bluish/brown liquid which glowed a bit. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Barbara “Question, is there a way I can pick the type of wolf I am becoming? Like hair or rather fur color I guess?”<br />
“I am afraid not.” Stated the nurse as she did a final check on the clip board on. “We aren’t sure if it is random or maybe DNA but that is something we can’t control. Do you want to change your mind?”<br />
<br />
“No.” answered Barbara with a shake of her head. “But thought I would ask if it was possible.”<br />
<br />
“No harm.” Confirmed the nurse as her fingers moved to the value on the bag. “You ready?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Barbara as the nurse opened the value as the liquid that would transform her began to flow out of the bag and into her arm.<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath and waited, for a while nothing happened as far as she noticed, so she just sat there looking at the IV bag which was emptying at a slow but steady rate. As she sat there she began to feel sweaty, she looked down to see her arms where covered in goosebumps and covered with sweat. Then she began to pant like she had just finished a long hard run..<br />
<br />
As she panted she had the feeling of throwing up, she tried to fight it but couldn’t as all her human teeth came out at once along with a small amount of blood. She ran her tongue along the inside of her mouth and felt multiple new teeth, a lot more of them curved canine teeth growing in her gum line. She felt her face push out into a muzzle as her nose grew out and turned black like the dogs she had as a kid. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons why she had picked werewolf was she always loved dogs and more often then not the dogs in the foster homes she had sent to where better then the parents she had been given. <br />
<br />
She looked up at the mirror and saw a dog like face on her still mostly human body, it still looked like her, she still recognized herself but now with a muzzle. Then more changes happened out of her long honey brown hair two pointed ears appeared as everything around her suddenly became a lot loader. The ears were rounded at the tip but still semi pointed as black fur appeared around them. A tan fur began to appear starting at her hair line and moving down to the tip of her nose and going under her eyes. From her eyes down a darker brown began to grow going down to her neck. <br />
<br />
Her face was done.<br />
<br />
Then with an almost burst of pain, Barbara grabbed her ribs as she grew in height a little bit while gaining more muscles, her breasts pushed out a bit but didn’t grow all the much in size remaining in the B range. New muscles formed on her arms, chest, and most of all on her legs. Tan fur, the same color around her eyes began to grow down her chest flaring out over her breasts before narrowing as it went down her now much stronger stomach, over her women hood and stopping around the inside of her knees. Black fur appeared around her shoulder blades traveling down almost her entire back. More black fur appeared on her legs going up to her knee line and from her elbows down. The rest of her pink human skin disappeared under the same rich brown. <br />
<br />
By now Barbara’s heart was pounding but she liked what she saw, her honey brown hair flowed down her new body covered in a mixture of tan, brown and black fur. Her hands began to change as pads formed and her nails turned into short claws. Her feet also began padded with longer sharper claws. <br />
<br />
“Almost done.” Said the nurse as with a slight groan of pain, her tail bone began to lengthen as a thick tail of black and brown fur appeared behind her. <br />
<br />
She was done, she was now a werewolf. A very beautiful and in her view sexy werewolf.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to our world.” Said the nurse<br />
<br />
“What now?”</p>
