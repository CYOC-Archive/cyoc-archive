<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing, looking, listening, drinking in the scents floating about me, ahh the calm delights of life!<br />
<br />
You look about, a fear works it's way into the web of your brain. A shake of the body offers a feeling of freedom as that torn shirt falls in a pile on the ground. A look back to the crunched bench and see torn tennis shoes laying in pieces next to your socks. <br />
<br />
Feeling as if someone or something is tracing your backbone you look to see what's up. Looking right, looking left, no one close, so what is it that makes your rump crawl. Then the sound a tare in the seat of both pants and shorts makes you look around.<br />
<br />
A crawly feeling as the tare makes you want, and then do shake from head to rump. The wiggle action works the tight pants loose and belt, pants and short flop around those dull sensed hoofs.<br />
<br />
The warm sun bakes down on your dark and hairy back. A breeze sends a chill across your every hair sprouting over body and limbs. A tingle of the breeze strokes the hair and bare skin on that rump. The tail which is now the norm, swings to and fro giving a new and richly enjoyable feeling. As you play with this new appendage it swings, swooshes, and slaps the thighs. <br />
<br />
Tingles of the breeze on hairs above, around, and below bring a sensation unequalled. A feeling of passion rolls over you as more feelings make for standing very still. You thoughts turn inward as the musky scents in the bring a new experiance. The feeling of an unfolding sensation holds you every thought. As muscle tensed the breathing becomes rapid dragging in more of than loving scent.<br />
<br />
The sounds of the crowd fade as you take this special moment to be alone with yourself and those special feelings. A welling up of desire to share with another this feeling makes your joints and every muscle strain to tight stiffness. Actions and reactions as muscles draw tight and then relax brings absolute thrill to this your private moments alone.<br />
<br />
A sudden surge and relief comes as the tauntness is relaxed and all the body stands loose. The tail resumed it's action as you step forward to feel the swing and sway of this strong and sensual body. Every member has it's part in the thrilling moment which has passed. Feeling of accomplishment, satisfied, a release of built up tensions now give a uforia' and freedom as never before.<br />
<br />
Turning to see the sight of a red jacketed' Coachman is walking toward you. He carries what looks to you a halter for some poor enslaved beast. Calm but meaningless words come from his mouth as if speaking a friendly but unknown language.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy big boy, easy, this won't hurt, easy!&quot; his words calm you as one holds still. The man slips of all the crazyness his halter over your head and senches the straps tight. He grips the halter and tugs your body into motion.<br />
<br />
Clippity clop, clippity clop,the sounds of those hard hooves on pavement makes a rythum you find nice and like a song in your heart. Looking as he leads you along the crowd steps away and people make remarks. The children speak now too but as the Coachman it is all so different a language. The man walks you close to the rear of his red velvet and black coach. A rein is clipped to the halter over your head and then attached to a ring at the rear of the coach.<br />
<br />
The man steps away without as much as a word. Suddenly he treats you with as little care if you were one of those donkeys which pull the coach. A crack of his whip and the donkeys strain to pull the heavy coach. Your rein jolts the head and neck and like some beast you are dragged along behind the coach.<br />
<br />
Stepping along smartly your thoughts of personal pride in keeping pace so easily with the coach brings a smile that can not show. A casual look down one need's to side step piles of manure left by some animal. The coach stops often, but your left tied to the rear. People passing you reach out and make odd and occasionally obscene touching of the back and rump. A desire to lash out a give a solid kick of those legs finally brings on a rash of HeeeHaws from this funny mouth.<br />
<br />
As you stop for a while the exercise and lapsed time brings on the personal need. The bladder aches for release, but not here, not in public that's immoral!  Your trip begins anew and the need builds with every passing moment. The gut and loins ache with a need for relief, if you can't find a restroom you'll bust, and soon.<br />
<br />
The coach rolls on without a care for to your pleading calls and personal needs. At last the coach comes to a stop in a wooded area filled with picnic tables and people paying attention to food and coversation. You look about and nobody is close! The need for relief has you in a cold sweat and one can't hold back the flood anymore.<br />
<br />
A half step ahead and stretching the back out long stands the legs and feet far to the rear. A last look about and the feeling of a unfolding tickles your thoughts again. Standing stiff the rush and flow relieve the ache but you just can't believe the volume. On it rushes till you can smell the acrid scent. At first you nose turns away but as the liquid mixes with sand and previous other releases by who knows, it's scent soothes and makes you feel calm somehow.<br />
<br />
The moments of personal humiliation are over but the fact your member is in view brings on moral concerns. One might get arrested for doing this in public, you think to yourself. A warm summer breeze tingles with a freshness to make the fear of reprisial fade into a thrill. Now you have taken a big step in your personal feelings about yourself. The continued stretched stance, a thrill of being well hung and open to the world makes this a special time.<br />
<br />
In these past few moments alone the world stood still and you did something which was always in the rear of your mind. A sense of satisfaction is suddenly wiped away as the Coachman walks to face you. A moment of wonder if your about to be balled' out for what was needed to be done. He holds your face and cheeks in his hands as the man bends his knees to peer at your face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd think by now you'd figured this out! Are my words making sense to your little brain?&quot; he said but at that moment you knew not what those strange words meant.<br />
<br />
The man takes a deep breath and begins to now make sounds which stick in your mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;HeeHaw, HeeoHawlaw, HooHeeHo, HeeHaw, HeeHaw, HoooHooo HOO-HEW-HAW!&quot; spoke the man, now it meant something.<br />
<br />
You returned his question as best the funny feeling mouth could!<br />
<br />
The words were change to protect the soft ears of those nieve people standing near. You listen as he explains your place in the world at large. His words at first baffle you but the senses which your body feels are made more real as the man talks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understand me, you are not human anymore! You have become a male Donkey! Your clothes are gone, but you won't need them since Donkey's have fur and never wear clothes. Those broad thighs and boney tail cover the most personal of places. As a Donkey, morals of humanity are not in use, your feelings of shame need not be felt. Those around you look upon this Donkey form as a pure animal. A beast that you now stand here is expected to act like a immoral creature that a Donkey would normally be! To relieve your personal needs is not to be of any concern hereafter. Donkey's don't have restrooms, there is no privacy you do as the need and situation suggests, understand?&quot; he explains and ask's your opinion.<br />
<br />
This is a truth, you know it and yet your mind thinks of it and you as being still of the human race. The brezze suggests new feeling as it touches many things you kept covered for reasons of social morays. Now things are different, you stand open to the viewing world. Those cares of human society are wiped away. Now is a time for self and the pleasures denied by your world around you. Relationships which before dealt with long term plans and the will's of those around you now will be for shorter terms. Terms, a good word for having relations with those others and being able to walk away leaving responsibility for your actions totally on others. Yours is to be a life of relations and by the call from others and those moments together is were you are that entity made to fill the gap.<br />
<br />
What a moment alone can afford for you new life ahead!</p>
