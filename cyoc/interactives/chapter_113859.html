<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">          Your name was Umbren Netherwood. The son of a small family in a farming village of the Nusquam Empire. You had only found out about your &quot;status&quot; a year ago on your fifteenth birthday. That day your life changed or rather began. <br />
<br />
    Sixteen years ago, a group of orc bandits began terrorizing your village. At first your village soldiers were able to fend them off, but eventually the orc shamans of the tribe started to use their Blood Magic to set upon a variety of deadly diseases upon the town. Many grew sick including your father, eventually nearby towns came to your village&#39;s aid and the shamans were killed, immediately stopping the curse from spreading. However the disease was still active in those already infected and your father&#39;s condition deterioated rapidly.<br />
<br />
   Desperate your mother and older brother who was only thirteen at the time prayed heavily to Sanas the Goddess of Health and Medicine, but she didn&#39;t come, instead, attracted by her desperation, one of the powerful Demon Lords visited your mother and offered her a pact. He would eradicate the disease that had infected your father at the exchange of her soon to be born son. Your mother eventually agreed and your father was saved. At the cost of you and your own life, it was that moment which turned you into a Demonblood.<br />
<br />
        Your family had traded one tragedy for another and soon you were born, seemingly a normal human child, but your parents knew better. Deep inside, you had the soul of a demon. It would only take sixteen years for it to awaken. Now tomorrow was your sixteenth birthday. <br />
<br />
            You sighed. Life wasn&#39;t easy. Throughout all of your life your family never treated you the same. They were distant and cold, as if they wanted you to disappear from their lives. At first your brother took your side and was confused at their cruelty. However after learning the truth, he soon adopted the same attitude. Even the townsfolk seemed to realize how different you were, somehow they knew you weren&#39;t normal, that you weren&#39;t human.<br />
<br />
     You wished things were different. You wished the org bandits had never invaded your town and that the foul demon lord who visited your mother never arrived. Yet here you were.<br />
<br />
       You shook your head and continued making your way through the forest you had grown up with. You used to play games with your brother here all of the time though now you wee out collecting herbs for your mother who happened to be the local doctor in the village, she tended both the young and elderly in the village making sure that everyone was healthy and well, even you. <br />
<br />
<br />
      As you walked through the forest, you began smelling the faint smell of fresh bread and yeast as you grew closer to the village. Pulling your hood up, you walked through the wooden gates of the town and made your way through the bustling town square. The town was especially lively today as the heat of summer was fading and soon the Fall Harvest would begin. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood and you heard that this year would be one of the best harvests your town will ever see in a long time.  You indulged in the aura of tranquility the town had as you walked on. However despite the peace, you felt eyes watching you as you walked. <br />
<br />
    Whispers saying &quot;That&#39;s the Netherwood kid over there, they say he&#39;s turning sixteen on the marrow.&quot; One voice whispered.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Really that&#39;s him? Something seems shifty about him.&quot; Another replied.<br />
<br />
     &quot;He always seems shifty. His parents barely ever talk about him, as if he was a stain on their lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
         You looked around searching for the quiet whispers, but as you turned around they stopped, the people around you making a visible effort to keep their distance.<br />
<br />
           You felt a familiar gnawing sensation gnawing  in your stomach and you quickened your pace home. After several minutes you finally arrived to your cottage and set the herbs you collected in a small storage container for the night. The sun was in late afternoon and beginning to dip closer into the horizon. Pulling back your hood, you enter your cottage and see your family in the dining area eating their servings of porridge and stew. <br />
<br />
         Before you entered you could faintly hear small snippets of conversation, but as they see you arrive they immediately freeze and look to you. You keep your head down and take off your cloak.<br />
<br />
         You making your way to the dining table and serve yourself a small helping of beef stew. Your family resume eating, albeit at a slower and more careful manner as if they were afraid you would murder them all if they made a small mistake.<br />
<br />
      You quietly eat, trying to bring up the courage to strike a conversation, but the words are caught in your throat. After several moments of awkward silence, your brother finally speaks up.<br />
<br />
      &quot;So Umbran... isn&#39;t tomorrowthe day you finally meet with your... &quot;friend&quot;.&quot; He says.<br />
<br />
    Your parents nod slowly, both of them forgetting the fact that it was also your birthday. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Yeah, I suppose tomorrow is the day I finally meet with him, not like I have any other choice.&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well... son. We&#39;ve already started packing up your belongings. You&#39;ll have a weeks worth of supplies and a spare set of travel clothes.&quot; Your father says, with you noticing a slight amount of force when he says the word son.<br />
<br />
      &quot;I know it&#39;s best not to ask, but do you know who he is exactly?&quot; You ask. Your parents had never told you which demon lord it was exactly and from your limited knowledge you knew there were dozens. <br />
<br />
   Your parents grow still, and you see a glimmer of sweat on your fathers brow.<br />
<br />
        &quot;We... aren&#39;t sure exactly. He never did tell us his name, that night he just... appeared in a haze of shadow.&quot; Your mother answers quietly.<br />
<br />
              Another moment of silence this time gut wrenching. Anger started to build up in you. They had treated you so unfairly your entire life. They thought you were a demon in disguise, waiting for its chance to strike yet never in your entire existence have you ever misbehaved so poorly that your parents would ever be forced to shun you. It wasn&#39;t your fault. If anything it was your mothers fault for willingly making a pact with a demon!<br />
<br />
         Through grit teeth you ask &quot;What.... what was it like?&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Your brother asks a mixture of caution and confusion on his face.<br />
<br />
    &quot;What was it like to grow up raising me? To know that if anyone found out we would all be killed? To be raising possibly the next demonic weapon?&quot; You say, doing your best to keep your anger out of your voice. <br />
<br />
     &quot;Son.... Do you want us to answer honestly?&quot; You father says, you look up meeting your father&#39;s eyes and for the first time in your life, he looked at you not with fear or precaution, but with a soothing understanding. As if he finally realized something.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Y-yes. Please tell me.&quot; You stutter out.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Very well. Us raising you... we were scared, terrified even. Making that pact essentially made us traitors to everything holy. After that day we became religiously heavy. We learned every prayer to nearly every god to you could think of and learned several religious rituals all in a effort to ease ourselves after what happened. We became scared of our own son. You have to realize that a your soul came from a demon! Don&#39;t you know how frightening that is to us? We don&#39;t know what will happen to you, but we do know nothing good will come of it. Deep in our minds we fear that you will become the next terror of the world. The next demon that even angels fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
      Tears start growing in your eyes, you were right all along. They did fear you, they did wish you were gone. Then your father continued.<br />
<br />
    &quot;But in a way we are also grateful. We didn&#39;t tell you the whole story. When the Omega came to forge the pact with your mother, the pact did not only affect me, it affected everyone in this town that had been infected by the shaman&#39;s disease. The demon lord had cured all of them. In a way, if it weren&#39;t for you, this town wouldn&#39;t have been the way it was now.&quot; Your father says.<br />
<br />
         You look down and now you cannot stop the tears from flowing down. A small puddle begins to form from your tears onto the table and you briefly wonder if this is the last time you will ever cry. That if after you meet with your demon lord that you will never shed tears again.<br />
<br />
       &quot;Now, I know... this may be a bit unexpected, but perhaps, if you ever manage to return no matter what you&#39;ll look like, no matter who you&#39;ll be, perhaps you could return here and we could all have a nice dinner together.&quot; Your mother says.<br />
<br />
       You wipe the tears from your eyes and nod. You finished your food and stand up from the table.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I&#39;ll be finishing packing up. If you don&#39;t mind, you won&#39;t see me tomorrow, I&#39;ll be leaving earlier so you won&#39;t have to worry about sending me off.&quot; You say quietly, nearly muttering to yourself.<br />
<br />
      Your parents nod and your brother simply stares at your quietly, his expression hidden making you wonder what he is thinking. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Goodbye my son. The Omega had said that tomorrow you&#39;ll feel a presence guding you towards where you will meet him. I wish you luck with whatever will happen.&quot; Your father says. <br />
<br />
      You nod and leave to your room and after an hour you fully pack your things. You strip to your britches and for possibly the last time fall asleep in your bed. You quickly then fall into a dreamless sleep. <br />
<br />
    The next morning, you wake up earlier as you said you would and father your bags. The sun has barely risen and you see nobody out in the streets from your window. Moving as quietly as you can you exit your house and leave the town. A few of the patrolling guards look at your curiously as you wave goodbye to them. The gates which at first looked warm and welcoming now seemed to be cold and forge in as you leave the town, it slowly becoming a dot in the distance as you feel the pull of where your Omega is waiting for you.</p>
