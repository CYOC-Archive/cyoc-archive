<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">PE had just finished, with Jake finding the 5km run easier than last time, and therefore finishing a few minutes before the others. The teacher said that he could just head to the showers, but after that, he&#39;d taken a quick look at Jake, saying to him: &quot;Well, the workout&#39;s doing you good, son. Just make sure to actually shower, because you reek as hell.&quot; As he walked to the showers, Jake was flustered. That was the first time Mr. Ackie had given him a compliment. Also, he did smell his odor, but it didn&#39;t smell too bad - not to him, at least. All this had something to do with that blue cum and the color of the pool, he was sure of it. <br />
<br />
After that episode the day before, he&#39;d been so exhausted he barely had had any time to mop any of the blue stuff. He&#39;d saved a small sample in an Evian bottle stored safely in his closet, pouring the rest down the drain and then falling asleep with his clothes on. When he awoke the following day he had felt starved again, which of course led to an encore of the previous feast. Now, this one was much smaller, but still about double the amount of food he usually ate for breakfast. He also had had time to think about a strategy. Maybe he could bring the sample of blum to the school lab when no one was there, to analyze it to the protocol? Somehow, he doubted that it was all over - the exceptionally strong BO hadn&#39;t appeared before noon. <br />
<br />
A voice reached his ears as he walked. &quot;Hey! Wait up!&quot; The speaker was the new guy, Kevin or something. He was average in height, with about the same build that Jake had now, but with dark hair and eyes, as well as a fine-featured face. He was good-looking, as far as Jake could say, but more of a prettyboy than both himself and any of the others he knew. &quot;You&#39;re Jake, right? I&#39;m Kenny.&quot; Right, Kenny, not Kevin. &quot;I didn&#39;t bring sneakers, so I had to do weight training instead.&quot; He seemed nice enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jake said, &quot;heading to the showers? I was just going there myself.&quot; They discovered that they had some things in common. Both had a younger and an older brother, both were fans of reading books, though apparently Kenny preferred fantasy to science fiction, which baffled Jake, but to each his own. Kenny led with most of the questions. &quot;So, you&#39;ve always been this strong a runner? Teach said you left everyone in the gravel back there.&quot; <br />
What to say to such genuine curiosity? The truth, why not? Augmented, of course. &quot;Yeah, no, I&#39;ve been running all summer, so I guess it&#39;s starting to pay off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, really smells like you went real hard there. Yeesh!&quot; Kenny held to his nose, acting out some Victorian lady&#39;s way of swooning out of disgust. Jake laughed as they entered the locker room. They undressed, keeping the chatter going. A few times, Kenny just stopped what he was doing, sniffing into the air, then continuing as if nothing had happened. Oh no, Jake thought to himself, this can&#39;t be part of it too, can it?<br />
Carefully, Jake stepped into the showers, removing his towel and taking a look at himself before Kenny could come in. It was clear that he was bigger down there, just judging from his flaccid dick. He had lost his abs, of course, but surely they could be rediscovered with some hard work. Thinking about his changes, he realized he was chubbing slightly, and then he felt something that he hadn&#39;t before. He felt a... pull... from behind, compelling him to turn around, as his vision changed color.<br />
<br />
This time, everything didn&#39;t become blue, but everything instead had a red tinge, like around the edges of everything there was a crimson-colored fire. As he turned around, he saw Kenny standing a few yards away from him, drinking in the sight, eyes wide open, his dick at full mast. &quot;Kenny...? What are you doing?&quot; Kenny walked over to him, as in a trance, kneeling before him, touching Jake&#39;s dick, rubbing it. Jake reacted barely at all. He wanted to jump away, he wanted to yell at Kenny to get away, but he... couldn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t stop Kenny from massaging his dick to erection, he couldn&#39;t walk away, he couldn&#39;t stop his hands from grabbing hold of Kenny&#39;s hair and pushing his head firmly towards his dick. This was fucked up beyond reason. Why the fuck couldn&#39;t he stop himself? This... this odor, this red vision, was it making him do this? Was it making Kenny do this!? He couldn&#39;t focus, as Kenny slid his lips up and down his fat dick. He took it like a champ, the full eight plus inches, massaging Jake&#39;s balls as he went. This is wrong, Jake thought, why aren&#39;t you stopping this!? he yelled in his mind, but his body did not answer to command. Then he heard loud voices and footsteps. In his red daze, he looked towards the locker room, where several figures appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK!&quot; Isaac shouted, while several of the others recoiled from the sight. &quot;What the fuck, Jake!?&quot; George said, clearly disgusted, but at the same time, the boys didn&#39;t move to leave. They just stood there, disgusted faces, eyes wide open, sniffing in the air. Jesus, not this, Jake thought to himself as he felt himself nearing orgasm. <br />
<br />
He moaned heavily, as he felt his balls churning, they felt insanely hot, they felt insanely heavy, &quot;FUUUUCK,&quot; he groaned, and in the back of his head - the brainy one - he heard the spectators audibly gasp. &quot;Look at his balls!&quot; someone said, it sounded like the star athlete Alec. &quot;Jesus, how big are they!?&quot; That was definitely Elijah. He felt it coming, and like a geyser erupting, he came hard. Kenny tried to dodge, but Jake, using power he didn&#39;t know he had, held him pressed in the deepthroat. <br />
<br />
He came, and he came, and he came. It felt like it lasted minutes, but finally he was done, and when he opened his eyes, he was very much in control of his actions and thoughts, the red linings gone. He looked to the guys, standing there, motionless, frozen. &quot;Bros...&quot; he began, before he heard a groan from his side. Jesus, Kenny! Kenny was clutching his stomach, curled into a fetal position. As Jake rolled him over, he removed his hands from his gut. And yes, it was a gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus FUCK!&quot; Jake exclaimed loudly, not really believing what he saw. Kenny had a very visible bloat, like he had ingested gallons, not ounces, of Jake&#39;s cum. He couldn&#39;t have cum that much, could he? Based on the small trickle around Kenny&#39;s mouth, it was at least not solidly blue, but there seemed to be a slight tint of blue to the white. &quot;Ah God,&quot; Kenny groaned as he pushed his back off the floor, and like that, the guys that had been watching shook out of their daze. &quot;Jesus, dude,&quot; Isaac exclaimed, and several turned to walked quickly. When Kenny began panting, however, they stopped. Jake froze too. Clutching his gut, Kenny was red-faced and panting, and he began to swell.<br />
<br />
It looked like it began around his arms, his triceps and biceps thickening and bulging, the guy himself looking at them in wonder. He lifted his right arm off the floor and flexed his biceps, producing an admirable bump, his triceps hanging slightly below, as the growth widened and rounded out his shoulders, his bones cracking as his upper body broadened and expanded. As they watched, his bloat had receded slightly, and his neck was straining and flexing, the tendons and muscles thickening slightly, ridding him of the thinness of his long neck, and his pecs began swelling.<br />
<br />
They inflated like water balloons, only they strained and swelled in each area, slightly drooping from their own weight, Kenny&#39;s nipples now facing in a slight downwards angle, and he had a slight pec cleavage formed. As his bloat receded more, his entire body seemed to be slightly elevated, and when Kenny reached behind, Jake understood that his glutes had gotten a few more layers of bulk. While Jake&#39;s stare had been fixated on his upper body, where Kenny&#39;s lats had began flaring, he hadn&#39;t noticed that Kenny&#39;s calves had grown too, while his quads began working. They grew closer together, swelling and straining, a perfectly respectable size for any high school athlete. Then, when his quads stopped, it began in Kenny&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
Clearly Kenny had blown his load while sucking off Jake, but his average-looking dick - probably around five rather thick inches or so - quickly hardened, and began swelling. It didn&#39;t take as long as it had for Jake, but for ten seconds or so, everyone in the room could see that Kenny&#39;s dick was growing and straining, fatter and longer, and his balls grew even faster, and more. they went from walnut-size to chicken-egg in about as much time as his dick spent gaining what looked like two inches in length. Kenny opened his mouth in awe of himself, and after a few quick strokes, he leaned his head back, ejaculating pure, white cum, and, as he did, he grew one last stretch, swelling all over his body, as the last of the bloat vanished, leaving behind a four-pack more cut than Jake&#39;s own. Two guys - George and Isaac - came over and helped Kenny to his feet, as everyone was staring, first at Kenny and his recently grown bod, then at Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck,&quot; he groaned, this time because he realized what everyone else was thinking.</p>
