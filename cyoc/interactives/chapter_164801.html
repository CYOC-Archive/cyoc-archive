<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy was rather surprised by the time the next morning came that he didn&#39;t wake up to the shrieking of a particularly nasty harpy he knew by the name of Lucy. He rubbed his eyes as he looked to the side and realized in a dawning moment what he had done last night. He barely remembered much of it from the sheer pleasure and fugue he&#39;d gone into just indulging every single little inclination he&#39;d had since he smelled Mitch that time at his tent. He&#39;d really done it, Andy realized. He&#39;d fucked a guy. Andy went to wipe his forehead and then saw his fingernails looked curiously a little bit sharper than they usually did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...&quot; Andy said to himself as he examined his hand, seeing how strange it looked on him. It looked...sharper than a fingernail should be. Almost like---<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, bro!!&quot; Mitch suddenly shouted as soon as he was up, looking right at Andy. Mitch seemed to be frightened by something, as if he had himself only just realized something. His eyes were traveling across Andy&#39;s body, from the great beard growth to the heightened amount of fuzz across Andy&#39;s enhanced physique, to his hands and then seeming to linger at his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What? What is it?&quot; Andy said, making shushing gestures with his hands, not wanting to alert anyone to what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, your fucking face, your...your eyes!&quot; Mitch responded, trying to keep quiet but clearly affected by what was going on. He guided Andy over to a small hand mirror in the tent, usually used by Lucy, and Andy muttered a very profane series of swears under his breath as he saw what had become of him. Sure he didn&#39;t exactly mind the physique, but the hair, the eyes, the beard stuff, his hands...<br />
<br />
And then he took a look longer at Mitch, &quot;Dude, look at yourself! You&#39;re...you&#39;re looking...kind of like me.&quot; Andy guided Mitch over to the mirror and showed him as well. He saw Mitch&#39;s eyes widen and his expression change to even further horror. This was beyond what Andy thought the consequences might be for his gay dalliance last night. He started pacing around in the tent, distressed and clearly worried by how much further this might go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! We have got to make this all less...obvious, I mean, look at you.&quot; Mitch said, running a hand down Andy&#39;s fuzzy chest and stomach, stopping before reaching his groin. &quot;Your eyes are fucking golden, man. Like, like some kind of cat&#39;s eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not some kinda cat!&quot; Andy snarled and crossed his arms, looking through the bags and accessories brought on the trip. He decided to trim some of his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what are you---?&quot; Mitch asked as Andy started to trim even as he looked around further.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna hide this. I-I hope this is as far as its gonna go. It has to be!&quot; Andy said as he trimmed his beard down with a straight razor with practiced ease, looking around for some of his clothes and more to the point, clothes that could cover up what had happened to him. By the time he finished trimming his beard, there was hair all over the ground, but at least Andy was feeling better about going out like this. He pulled out a pair of sunglasses, for his unnatural eyes at least until he could say he got &quot;novelty cat&#39;s eye&quot; stuff for his eyes.<br />
<br />
Mitch then said, &quot;Hand me the razor, I gotta trim up some of this hair...&quot; Andy handed it to him and the other man started trimming up his hair.<br />
<br />
Andy meanwhile pulled on his track pants, noting they were tighter than they were yesterday, and then pulled on one of his bigger shirts, growling a bit under his breath that it was tight and seemed to catch on his body hair (like hell he was gonna get rid of his &quot;awesome new body hair&quot;), and pulled on a light but roomy jacket over that to cover how his muscles were looking. Sure he disliked not being able to show his new gains, but these changes were coming way too fast.<br />
<br />
Mitch asked him, &quot;Wait, where&#39;s your girlfriend? Isn&#39;t this your tent man?&quot; He was already getting dressed and ready to head out.<br />
<br />
Andy gulped, and finished making sure he had everything ready before leading the way out, Mitch following behind him as the other man finished pulling on a top. Andy started wondering if something went wrong... and then he saw it, and guessed he had no right being surprised. Lucy was just getting out of a tent alongside some big, tanned brown haired bodybuilder looking dude with a rather boyish face. Guy wasn&#39;t even wearing a shirt at present, not bothering to hide what that was.<br />
<br />
And honestly? Even though Andy knew he should be more angry about the infidelity, he just kind of pitied the poor guy she was fooling around with. &quot;My dude,&quot; Andy said to himself as he shook his head, &quot;You do not know what it is you&#39;re getting yourself into.&quot;<br />
<br />
It looked like it was time to start moving out for the day for the Safari. Andy admitted he was still feeling pretty excited to see what was to come today. Even with everything that happened, he found that he wanted to see this through.</p>
