<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The flowing streamers of energy started to swarm around you, like you were stuck in a wind tunnel, or a hurricane. They just span around you, swimming around your body from head to toe. You were deeply concerned by this point. Despite you struggling to stop enjoying the feeling of Amazimanda honking your breasts and motioning her finger on the exposed skin of your bubblebutt, your shocked expression came back in full force, which of course made the clown girls laugh. You wanted to yell at them, but they had a hold on you that you couldn&#39;t stop. They clearly were the bosses around here, and they had already changed you this much. Whatever this change was, it was covering your whole body. You just wished that it wasn&#39;t another expansion of your already huge boobs and butt. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t notice it at first, but you definitely felt the feeling without seeing what it was. You felt this itchiness right at the ends of your toes. You couldn&#39;t reach them to deal with the slightly bothersome nature of the itch, but that wasn&#39;t the end of your problem. The feeling of itchiness started to climb up, covering your whole toes. It wasn&#39;t exactly painful, just really itchy all of a sudden. It was like they were being coated in something. In some ways, you was right, and in others, you were wrong. It was only until you sure the tiniest part of your toes in your sight, that was mostly covered up by your breasts, that you noticed what was going on. Your skin changed. The pigments in your skin were getting paler. Not only that, but your toenails were also... painted? You double checked. Yep, they were painted in the ghastly red that matched your bulbous red nose. The itchiness continued to climb up, covering your long feet halfway. You tried your hardest to move your arms, even just an inch, to try and manage to deal with the itchy feeling. You tried to get your legs to lift up to help out and reach your arms just to scratch them, but nothing worked. It was like your body betrayed you, or like your whole body was magnetically stuck into position, like a soldier at attention. You continued to at least try again as the itchiness spread, covering your feet completely. You looked down again, and you saw how far it spread. Your skin was getting paler and paler. Any instance of colour was wiped away, like printings fading in the sunlight. You couldn&#39;t even see any marks or hair, they were just gone, like your body just became an open canvas, and Amazimanda and her nerdy clowns were the painters. The itchiness was crawling up your legs, removing any scratches, marks, scabs, or hair that stood in it&#39;s way. They just faded away, like stars in the sunlight. Your feet were now completely white. Not a hint of colour, apart from your toenails, ever hit them. Not even the sight of a possible mole or otherwise. It was as plain as plain could be. You almost felt your leg hairs retreat inside your leg as the itchiness was climbing it&#39;s way up to get your now huge bubblebutt. It itched like crazy, the utter annoyance that you couldn&#39;t even get near it to at least deal with it for a short while made Amazimanda laugh and chuckle at you. As it reached your pelvis, it changed from itchiness to ticklish. As it flowed around your weight, you couldn&#39;t help it. You started to get the giggles. You couldn&#39;t help it, and you quickly hated yourself that you couldn&#39;t even hold it in. It just came out like a train driving through a tunnel, it never stopped. As the white started to go to your now huge chest, the giggles became harder to control. Amazimanda loved watching you laugh and giggle away, which in turn made you even more embarrassed to even be in this situation. Every giggle made your breasts and butt shake like jelly, which made Amazimanda laugh more and in turn, made you more and more embarrassed. You blushed so much that the blush stayed on your cheeks as the white covered your face like you were hit with a paint brush. It covered your shoulders and flowed down your arms and hands effortlessly, which made your fingernails join your toes as they were as red as your nose. You noticed that your eyelashes were longer as well, like they grew as the white covered your face. You were just thankful that the giggling stopped. You could finally take a breather.<br />
<br />
Well, almost. Amazimanda immediately jumped towards you, bouncing along as if the whole floor were made up of miniature trampolines. She did several tricks, even bouncing on her, similar sized to yours, own bubblebutt. You weren&#39;t surprised that she was able to bounce on that thing, honestly with how it felt, they were like biological space hoppers. She stood right up close to you. By now, you didn&#39;t know what to expect, and how you were able to stop her from making you laugh out of body. Whatever it was, you couldn&#39;t show your true feelings, you were just made to laugh at whatever she did to you. You hated it. She stared at you, smiling away with her big blue eyes. You couldn&#39;t help but stare back. It was like the whole room just faded away and it was just you and her, it creeped you out. What you didn&#39;t notice was that her hand stretched around and pinched your bubblebutt.<br />
<br />
HONK!<br />
<br />
Even that honked?! You should have known. Of course, the pure shock of it didn&#39;t register anywhere on your body. You were still forced to laugh as if your body had no way of responding in the way you actually felt. Amazimanda and the nerdy clowns, of course, all bellowed out their laughter as you did too. You couldn&#39;t believe how much you were forced to laugh just in these few moments alone. All this laughing would have given you a heart attack if you did this before now. It wasn&#39;t like you were like these alien clown girls, you weren&#39;t like them, you would have died if you kept laughing like them. You blushed, embarrassed to see how pure white you had become. Everything from head to toe was now pure white, like you had been thrown into a vat of white paint. Even your breasts were now whiter than white. And now you discovered that almost every part that they have added to you, the breasts, the nose, the huge bubblebutt, honked. You wanted to hang your head in shame, but your body was still letting the laughter die down.<br />
<br />
&quot;*HehehehahahahahaHyuck* You&#39;re a funny one, you honk more than a goose, don&#39;t ya know. *HeheheheHyuck* You just need one more thing. Samantha, Sindy, do you have the lipstick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lipstick?<br />
<br />
&quot;*HehehaHyuck* Lipthtick, lipthtick, where could the lipthtick... Aha! Got the lipthtick here, Amathimanda!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sindy threw the lipstick her way. She opened up the red lipstick, placed more than enough on her and jotted towards you. You wanted to run or shield your face, but you couldn&#39;t. Amazimanda dove and placed her lips onto yours. It was a long kiss that seemed to go on forever, and all you wanted at this point was to escape her kiss, let alone the spaceship. She finally let go, and her lips didn&#39;t have a trace of lipstick on her. They were the same colour they were before. An odd colour that matched her costume, but definitely not the red she had on. You tried to look down, and you saw what happened. Your lips were red, just like your nails and just like your nose. You couldn&#39;t feel the hint of lipstick on it at all. It broke through the pigmentation and now your lips were just as clownish as your nose. You experienced another hit of dopamine. You couldn&#39;t help but bite your lip as it felt stronger this time. Whatever was creating these hits of dopamine was really messing with your mind. You couldn&#39;t help but enjoy them. They altered your perception of these changes that were happening to you. You knew that you hated every change and all that you wanted to do was leave and run away as fast as you could with these new &quot;additions&quot;, but these dopamine hits just sort of numbed your brain enough for a short while to stay long enough that the next change was already starting. You were immovable, stuck letting these things happen to you, and you couldn&#39;t call for help, because you knew that they had the power to stop you from speaking and start making you laugh. There had to be a way out.<br />
<br />
You were just begging for this process to finish and let you go.<br />
<br />
They were also thinking that, though letting you go would mean more than you think.</p>
