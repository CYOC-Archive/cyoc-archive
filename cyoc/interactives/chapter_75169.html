<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Travis is your typical college student in his sophomore year. Not really sure of want he wanted to do with his life, and just taking classes because he had to. He had finally made it down to the end of the semester. This meant that he had some big exams coming soon.<br />
<br />
Like most college students his studying for these exams consisted of a small amount of memorization and actual studying and a very large amount of surfing the web looking at random sites. On one of these random tangents lead him to Facebook. After looking at all of his notifications and commenting on a few random statuses his friends had put up he was about to return to studying. He did have an 11 am exam the next day after all. When he noticed that his suite mate Riley had messaged him 5 minutes ago and Travis hadnt seen it on his phone when he walked back from class. <br />
<br />
A bathroom that they shared by two doors in which either side could be locked for privacy connected their single dorm rooms making it a suite. Being typical college kids their was no way that they would physically walk all that way to talk to each other face to face so FB chat was the next best thing.<br />
<br />
The message read, &quot;Travis man you should check out this web page, it has some crazy stuff on it,&quot; Riley said. &quot;What all is on it?&quot; Travis quickly messaged back only to find Riley had immediately gone offline.<br />
<br />
This was very odd to Travis he and his suite mate were good friends and he knew something was off. Travis got up from his desk that was directly in front of his window and adjacent to his bed, and went to go check on his friend.<br />
<br />
Travis found that the door leading to Riley’s room was locked. He knocked and heard nothing. “Maybe he was laying down for a quick power nap before he continued studying,” Travis Thought.<br />
He returned to his computer and read the link. It seemed reliable and Travis trusted his friend that it did not have a virus or did not contain anything too nasty. So he clicked on the link.<br />
<br />
He was immediately redirected to a rather bland looking website. The header was in what looked like an ancient language that he had never seen before. Like a mixture of hieroglyphics, Greek, Viking, and other old languages he didn’t know. It looked completely unintelligible.<br />
<br />
Although, under the heading there was a list of languages that, apparently, the website could be translated into. Upon selecting English, he saw that under was the header was a translation that read, “The Book of Incantations”.<br />
<br />
Under the header were three other sub heads, Curses, Blessings, and Transfigurations.<br />
“Wow this is completely insane,” Travis thought out loud, “this cant be real… but just to be sure I will see what this is all about.” In the back of his head he remembered the peculiar behavior that his suitemate had shown after talking about it. This only interested him more.<br />
<br />
“Blessings and curses sounds a little serious” Travis thought, so he proceeded to click on the transfiguration tab.<br />
The page quickly loaded and he saw that the page was filled with the same bunch of gibberish shortly followed by a translation as the previous screen. “Hmm… it looks exactly like an eBook.” The page on the left was a table of contents and the next was the beginning of Chapter one that was titled ‘Introduction’.<br />
<br />
After reading the first couple paragraphs Travis learned that this was a online book/resource of incantations that would change the caster physically, mentally, or both into what the charm said it would. It also said that the incantations could be combined with one another for a more specific result.<br />
<br />
The next 3 chapters consisted of Animal, Age Regression/Progression, and Gender incantations. Travis decided to go with the animal chapter because, “There was no way this crap was real, but might as well try it out” he figured.<br />
<br />
After clicking ‘Chapter II Animal Transfiguration’ it brought him to the first page of the chapter. All it had was a drop down menu with a whole bunch of species on it. Immediately he saw Canis familiaris, which he recently learned from, his biology class was a domestic dog. This immediately piqued his curiosity because after all what little boy hasn’t wondered what it would like to be a dog. “Its not like its actually going to work” he reminded himself.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden it seemed like the ceiling light, his computer, and his desk light all lost power for a split second. “I must have just blinked/ flinched” he posed.<br />
<br />
After clicking the species he was redirected to a pair of pages that appeared to have the incantation in the gibberish on the left page and the translation on the right page. The incantation had, what seemed to be, a disclaimer under the Canis Familiaris heading. It read, “ This incantation is to be read aloud, and will turn the caster into their inner breed/type of the chosen species. For fully permanent and fully immersive affect all 10 lines must be read. For 12-hour affect, only 9 lines are to be read. Depending on strength of the casters will power, in addiction to the physical change, there will be a degree of mental change. Including new instincts, behaviors, needs, and mannerisms of the new species. For the 9 line incantation the caster can, if strong enough mentally, resist total change of mental ability/instincts. The full incantation will cause permanent mental change.” Travis read.<br />
<br />
“Might as well give it a try I guess,” Travis said aloud. “If it doesn’t work who cares? I go back to studying and make fun of Riley for thinking this stuff is real. And if it miraculously does work than I get to be a dog for a 12 hours and that would be so sick.”<br />
<br />
Slowly Travis began to read the text in his head and thought of how it might sound when said aloud. “This is gonna sound so stupid, but here goes nothing.” He then proceeded to read aloud the 9 lines of what seemed like pure nonsense. Upon finishing the very last syllable of the 9th he blinked/flinched again because it looked as if the power had gone out for a second.<br />
<br />
After sitting there for a couple of minutes watching himself in the full length mirror on the back of the door leaving his room. He saw nothing noticeable. He turned back to his desk and computer exited out of the webpage with a disgruntled and slightly disappointed sigh, and continued to study for his exam.<br />
<br />
Studying is harder now for some reason. He feels restless and the room is has become much noisier. He hears people talking outside in the parking lot 3 stories down, and the loud strumming of a classmate’s guitar that was 2 stories up. Then he realized what he was hearing and how far away the sources of the noises really were. “What the hell. Why can I hear these things so well?”<br />
<br />
His window was closed, and his door too. All of a sudden Travis hears a slight rumble coming from his bathroom. He remembered he had left his door leading to his room open. He heard the dead bolt to the door opening to his suitemate, Riley’s room. It sounded like he was having a lot of trouble with the opening the door. “Riley?! Is that you?! You finally wake up from your nap?!<br />
<br />
There was no response. But Travis heard some movement in the bathroom. Slowly something was moving through the bathroom. “What the hell is going on here?” He thought. “This is creepy.”<br />
<br />
He got up to investigate when a hand stuck out of the bathroom door and into his room. It wasn’t just a hand though. It was a hand that was covered in medium length white hair and it was changing shape. The fingernails turned black, lengthened and started to come to a point as the fingers shrunk into the hand. “WTF its changing into a paw!!”<br />
<br />
After the hand had completely finished changing an all white german shepherd trotted into the room, tail wagging jauntily from side to side. It was strong looking and slightly wolf like in stature and appearence. Something was way off though. “Umm why is there a dog coming from our bathroom and why does that dog have a pair of partially ripped/torn black boxers on,” Travis asked to himself. He noticed that they looked like the pair that Riley would wear with no other shred of clothing around their suite.<br />
<br />
“Riley… is that you?” Travis questioned with a nervous but anxious tone. “RUFF RUFF” the white german shepherd responded. “No freaking way that’s you Riley!” Travis exclaimed. “If that’s you bark four times, growl, then howl,” he directed. “RUFF RUFF RUFF RUFF GRRRRRR AROOOOOOO,” the shepherd quickly answered.<br />
<br />
“It is you!” Travis exclaimed. “Did you read the dog incantation? Bark once for yes, two for no.” “RUFF.” “Well this sucks. It doesn’t work on me, maybe I read it wrong.” “RUFF RUFF.” “No? No what Riley?” Travis said as he absentmindedly scratched an itch on his left ear. It felt different. Almost like it had grown a little bit. He quickly glanced at Riley who was giving him the stereotypical head tilted to the side tongue lolled out his mouth, big shepherd ears perked up as if he is questioning the same thing Travis was. Travis then looked in the full length mirror and saw that both his ears had grown in size and had risen into his black hair. “What the hell is wrong with my earrrr?!” As they continued to grow he felt as if they were charged with static electricity as the small amount of hairs he had on his ears and the hair on his head became to grow on the now pointy but partially limp ears he now sported that were now covered in fur. He felt his ears with his hands as he quickly got up to get a closer look in the mirror, with Riley right on his heels. “I have dog ears!!” he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
He then feel the static feeling start to spread to the rest of his head, through every bit of hair and light facial fuzz everyone has on their faces. “Whats gonna happen nEEExxxXXttRRRRRR” Travis’s voice cracked on the last word then ended with a low very dog like growl. His vocal cords had started to change.<br />
<br />
He watched as his black hair began to change texture and become the same type of fur on his ears. As the fur moved towards his forhead it began to change to a brilliant white and moved down the middle of his face over his forhead, past his his nose and chin, and continuing down the front of his shirt. Black fur continued to spread from the top of his head to cover the sides of his head, down his neck and onto his back and shoulders.<br />
<br />
He blinked hard a couple of times and with each blink he saw the color drain from his colorful clothing, his eyesight becoming monochrome. The static feeling was now concentrated on his nose, mouth and chin as he felt and heard his face begin to push out into what was undoubtedly becoming his muzzle. He could hear the bones cracking and snapping as it grew while his lengthening tongue lolled our of his mouth , and he spoke aloud, “I caNt BeLIEve this is HAppEnING to ME. I aM grOWIng A muZZLerrrrARRROOOOOOOOO.” His voice was completing its changes as his face pushed out ending with a very canine like howl.<br />
<br />
Travis focused again on the image in the mirror and saw that he now sported the head of a Border Collie on his other wise, except for some hair growing down his neck, human body. “Travis? Can you hear me?” Travis heard. He instinctually did the same head tilt that Riley had when he was confused. “Travis its Riley. Im right behind you.” Riley said. “WHAAAAT I can understand you?! I can speak to you?!” Travis quickly replied. “Haha, Yep you have the mouth and ears and vocal cords of a dog now, so you speak dog now. Quick before your hand change go turn on your web cam to record the rest of your TF.” Riley instructed Travis. Travis wasted no time and quickly ran back to his computer to make the change.<br />
<br />
“This is crazy, I cant believe this is working?!” Travis exclaimed to Riley. “Yea and you have just begun, it feels sooo good to change, just you wait.” Said Riley.<br />
<br />
All the excitement had distracted Travis from the spreading of the charge feeling down his neck and into his skinny chest and back. The fur continued to spread as he felt his chest barrel out and start to stretch his shirt. “Ohh I forgot to tell you, you should probably strip down because you will lose your clothing but I think it makes the change even better to leave them on” Riley explained.<br />
<br />
Travis felt his changing ribs push out against his shirt to its breaking point when it completely ripped down the front. It was still stuck on his now fur covered shoulders and he removed the tattered remains. “Your right Riley. It feels great.” Travis finally gets to take in the changes that had occurred to his chest and back as he felt the static charge feeling lessen a little but remain a constant feeling that had started to radiate down his arms and down to his hips and upper legs. His chest was covered in the same white fur that covered his broadened neck and even slimmer belly; while his back was now covered in the same jet black fur he sported on his head and ears.<br />
<br />
White fur continued to move down his arms as they shrank to become his forelegs. The changes had also made its way to his hips, which began to slowly begin to change his stance. He started to lean forward until he was leaning all his weight on his desk and continued to fall until his mostly changed arms rested on his carpeted floor. He watched as the fur and the tingling sensation made its way closer and closer to his hands. “Hey Travis before your hands change could you help me get my boxers off of me?” Riley asked. “Better hurry I can feel the bones and tendons in my hands already starting to pop, crack, and shrink.” Travis replied.<br />
<br />
Travis got a hold of the tattered boxers as his fingers started to curl and become the short toes of a dog while his nails became sharp claws. These new claws combined with a little shake from Riley freed him of his human clothing and gave Travis a first look at some of Riley’s changed anatomy he had yet so see. “Wow that different, is mine gonna look like that?” Travis questioned. “Haha yea the change down there feels pretty good too. That and the tail are some of the best parts. And mine got bigger when it changed haha” Riley laughed. “Haha nice” Travis said in regard to the thought of the change of a very important part of his male anatomy.<br />
<br />
Like the rest of his body the tingling sensation in his new forelegs and paws faded but still remained a constant feeling. The tingling intensified in his lower body below his changed hips and down his legs. The sensation intensified on a point right above his butt and created a need for him to stretch it high into the air. In canine fashion, on his front paws and fur covered knees, he outstretched his forelegs, lowered his chest and raised his fur covered butt high into the air. Just like a dog who is eager to play would.<br />
<br />
“OOH here we go Riley said. I thought it felt nice with just boxers on. I bet it will feel really good with boxers and athletic shorts on.” Riley said in reference to the last remaining clothes on Travis’s changed body. He stretched and stretched as he felt the tingling intensify even more until he felt a pop and something pushing out of his tailbone. It was now pushing very firmly against the seat of his boxers and shorts. “That’s gonna be a big one!” Riley commented, “not as long and furry as mine though, haha.” As Riley referenced his furry, long very wolf like tail. The more it grew and the more it stretched his clothing the more intense the feeling became until it came to a high as his newly sprouted tail ripped through both layers of his clothing. Like a bent spring it sprung out of its confines reaching its full length of 2.5 feet and wagged a bit before resting between his fur covered legs.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t that incredible?” Riley asked. “Hell yes. That felt so good.” Travis responded. “Ooh I feel my legs starting to change” Travis said. As the tingling that was now present in almost every part of his body now spread down to his toes.<br />
First his legs begin to shorten. Travis laid down on his doggy side to look back and watch the changes. Then with a loud snap and a slightly unpleasant pop his knees reversed direction as the bottom of his legs slimmed and his thigh muscle was reallocated in a way that a dog’s upper hind leg looks. His feet quickly shrank while his toes curled under and nails changed to claws just like his hands had.<br />
<br />
He stood up shakily for the first time on his new legs. He was now a perfect example of a strong young male border collie, except for one detail. He looked down between his legs to see that the elastic waste band of his boxers had remained intact and covered his gentlemen’s region. “Get down there and rip those off” Riley recommended. “If you want to see it change, because trust me you will definitely feel it.”<br />
<br />
Travis sat down carefully avoiding sitting on his new tail and worked his now very flexible body down to where his head was right there. “Wow I can definitely lick anywhere I want… hahaha anywhere at all” Travis laughed and looked at his shepherd friend who shared a laugh. He felt the intense tingling move into the only unchanged region of his body as his manhood soon to be doghood began to change. He ripped off and dropped the remains of the shorts to watch the tf. His balls covered with the same white fur that his belly had and increased in size. The fur then made its way around his hardening penis and created a furry white sheath that attached to his belly. Travis felt immense pleasure as he felt his manhood changing in its new furry home as it began to push out to reveal for the first time its new shape. It, like his balls had grown and become red and pointed.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s different” Travis said looking up at Riley. “Yea I could tell you loved that feeling though. I told you it would feel great didn’t I? And its so much more sensitive” Riley responded while looking at his own changed member as it had revealed itself slightly as well.<br />
<br />
“This is so cool. We are dogs now Riley!” Travis said. “Yep only for about 11 hours or so now though.” Travis looked at the clock. It was 9 pm. “So we should change back around 9 am?” he asked. “Yep, sounds about right. This is so much better than studying.” Riley said.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of the boys turned dogs discovering their new forms Travis asked, “what was that little section about with all the stuff about the ‘will’ of the caster and instincts and stuff?” “I don’t know man… but I kinda feel this nagging voice in my head telling me to do stuff. Doggy stuff. Like to sniff your butt and such.” Riley said. “Hmm” Travis wondered aloud. “I think we should have some fun and let out some of our inner dog.” “Sounds good to me,” Riley responded.<br />
<br />
The young canines spent the next few minutes realizing their human minds and began to become immersed in their inner dog instincts and behaviors. The pair of dogs spent the rest of the night playing tug or war with shoes, playing, and some other things to themselves that should not have been caught on Travis’s webcam. They fell asleep around 3am, on Travis’s full sized bed. Both had fallen asleep with objects in their mouths. Travis was by head of the bed with a pillow in his while Riley at the foot of the bead with one of his leather shoes in his.<br />
<br />
At 9 am they slowly started to change back to their human forms. They awoke to Travis’s Alarm at 10 am and where two young male dogs had fallen asleep two nude young male humans awoke. At first they were unaware of their nudity then with a blush immediately covered themselves.<br />
<br />
Riley left the room to go put some clothes on and Travis did the same. Riley came back with his computer in his hands, he had recorded his dogification as well. Pointing to Travis’s computer Riley said, “Travis lets watch what we did last night.” The video showed Travis’s change, and their speaking to each other in dog. It just sounded like a bunch of yips, barks, growls, and howls. And then it showed all of their activities of the night and morning and even their slightly embarrassing nude wake up.<br />
<br />
“Well that was freaking awesome” Riley exclaimed. “Yeah it sure was” Travis said. “We definitely should do this again soon, maybe try something different?” Riley posed. “Yea,” Travis responded quietly “sounds good :3”</p>
