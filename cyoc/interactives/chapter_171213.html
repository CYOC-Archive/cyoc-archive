<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok, fine. I will do it&quot; Alec finally caved in. His boobs were just way too sore to try and fight it anymore. He actually had known for some time now that it would become inevitable that he&#39;d be forced to either milk himself or remove the milk some other way. It was just his personal pride that was stopping him from easing his own burden. Looking over at Vivian, he gave her a defeated smerk. &quot;Well, if you are ready Vivian, we may as well get this over with.&quot; Vivian nodded and right as she was about to move, her body exploded outwards into her origional size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait its over already? Huh, now I am not even hungry anymore too. Well, I guess I don&#39;t need your tits anymore Alec&quot; joked Vivian as she inspected her body. When Alec didn&#39;t respond, she stopped her personal inspection to see what was up. What she saw was Alec pushed down onto his back, with Andrea&#39;s hand covering his mouth as she sucked greedily from both of his nipples at the same time. <br />
<br />
Alec couldn&#39;t even push Andrea off of himself even if he wanted to, which for the moment, he had no intention of doing. Having his milk sucked out of him just felt so good. He just laid their obediently, and let Andrea have her way with his tits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Andrea! What the hell are you doing to him! Get off of him.&quot; Paniced Vivian as she ran over to pull her off of Alec. The moment she pulled her off, Andrea began to struggle. &quot;Noooo! Let me drink from Mommy! Let me drink from Mommy!&quot; she cried, throwing a toddler-like tantrum. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is wrong with you Andrea?&quot; questioned Vivian. Alec was still down on the ground, now also teary eyed. &quot;Vivian, please let her suck. My tits hurt so much. Please, she was helping me keep from being over filled.&quot; His begging made Vivian reconsider, so she let Andrea down, who quickly crawled back over to Alec and resumed her suckling. Meanwhile Vivian crouched down next to them. &quot;I think Andrea is acting wierd now&quot; she began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I noticed that she was very child-like, especially when she called me Mommy.&quot; Alec agreed with her. Andrea definitely had something going on. &quot;Maybe your toddler-ism transfered to her, except instead of a physical change like with you, it altered her mentality instead?&quot; he suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then this is definitely not good if that is the case. It means this is a charm meant to prank the target(s). It means there is no instant cure or removal spell. But on the plus side it wears off on its own, and often rather quickly at that. So if we are lucky, she should revert soon enough. In the meantime though, I guess you better become a great Mommy and do your best to raise your daughter right.&quot; joked Vivian as she tried to not laugh at the end. Alec just rolled his eyes a d moved himself into an uoright sitting position, as he moved Andrea over onto his lap, who was now sucking just on his left boob. After a few minutes, he swapped her around and she continued to empty his right. The moment she was full, Andrea curled up in his arms and fell asleep. <br />
<br />
She slept for about an hour and a half before she bolted upright, wide awake. &quot;What the fuck just happened&quot; Andrea said very confused. &quot;Why am I on your lap Alec? And, bleggh, what is this taste in my mouth. Eww, that tastes so horrible.&quot; Squealed Andrea, as a stream of white liquid tickled down her chin as she spit out a small glob of coagulated spoiled breast milk that she hadn&#39;t apparently swallowed when she fell asleep. &quot;Ewwww, what the hell even was that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Vivian nearly puked as well, and Alec felt squeamish. &quot;Breast milk. Spoiled, lumpy breast milk. Ughhhh.&quot; Vivian said with a shutter. Alec explained what had happened fo A drea who had no memory of it, which may have ultimatly been for the better anyways. Andrea looked as pale as a ghost when she heard what happened. And quickly grabbed for her bag. Inside a small pouch, she retrieved a metal flask and took a generous sip of the alcohol, then she just let it sit there in her mouth for a few seconds, until she spat that out too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you drank.&quot; Alec commented when he noticed the flask. &quot;I don&#39;t. At least not enough to warrent carrying a flask of it around at all times with me. This is pure alcohol. I use it often as an alchemical ingredient, and it is not safe to swollow. But damn, does it burn. At least now I can&#39;t taste that spoiled milk anymore. Once we get to a place where I have enough water, I will clean out my mouth and heal my tongue&quot; she explained. <br />
<br />
For some reason Alec felt a little disheartened. &quot;Does my milk actually taste bad?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No. It tastes, well I can&#39;t remember, and I can&#39;t tell you now that my tongue is burned. But I think it wasn&#39;t bad.&quot; Andrea tried answering. Vivian took the direct approach and wrapped her lips around Alec&#39;s left nipple and sucked out a small amount. Then she sucked out a bit more. Then some more. Until she just didn&#39;t stop. &quot;Um, while I appreciate the milking, what are you doing Vivian?&quot; The question brought Vivian back to reality and she spat the nipple out of her mouth. &quot;Um, Sorry about that. But to answer your question. Even calling it good feels like I am underplaying it. It is that good. I easily could drink it for hours, no question.&quot; She explained. Then added &quot;If it is alright with you, would you mind if I just started drinking straight from you whenever I get thirsty from now on?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I guess... you can. Only if you really want to though.&quot; Alec said, trying to keep himself from smiling. Hearing that he produced great tasting milk had put him in an unusually happy mood. &quot;At least no one is actively cursed anymore, well, besides maybe Alec&#39;s tits since they still havent gone down really at all, a d actually seem to be making him more... womanly, I guess is the accurate term? Definitely making him more feminine either way. So we still should look to fix that as our top priority.&quot; Andrea summarize for the group. It was subtle, but Alec knew he was becomming more and more feminine by the hour. In many places, his skin was a lot softer, and he had lost a fair amount of his body and leg hair. To this, Alec nodded &quot;I agree, we need to fix me soon. And also thanks you two, for helping me do it and all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Considered it as me returning the favor for rescuing me&quot; said Andrea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I am your party member after all. So it is only obvious that I would help you. Is there even a need for another reason?&quot; explained Vivian. &quot;Now then, lets get back to town quickly, we are already a bit behind schedule because of what has happened today and last night.&quot;</p>
