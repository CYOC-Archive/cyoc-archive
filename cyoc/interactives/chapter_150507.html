<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eve&#39;s Perspective:<br />
<br />
Eve always woke up earliest of her room mates to get the cleaning done before they woke up. She always felt better after cleaning, even if it didn&#39;t need it so much. Eliza and Lily were clean people and Marie at least kept her mess in her own room for the most part. As usual Natasha and Naomi would be coming over for breakfast so she&#39;d have to make a little extra. This early in the morning the sun was just peaking in the window over the sink. Taking a deep breath, she smiled just knowing that today would be a great day. <br />
<br />
As she brought the chairs over to the table for breakfast, she grabbed her own customary chair. Ever the gracious hostess, she opted to take one of the lawn chairs so the other girls could sit in the comfortable table set. As she returned to grab the other lawn chair, she paused confused for a moment. They didn&#39;t plan to have any other guests besides Naomi this morning... What an odd stray thought to need the extra chair... She turned as she tapped her head with her index finger, Oh well... Breakfast wasn&#39;t going to make itself was it? She giggled fondly to herself as she pulled her apron down from its hook. Soon the smell of Bacon, eggs, and pancakes filled the air, cooking was another of her favored hobbies, truly.<br />
<br />
When the knock came at the door, Eve undid her apron setting it back on the hook. Humming along her way to the door, she knew exactly who to expect on the other side as much as they knew it&#39;d be her to answer. Opening the door revealed the ever energetic Naomi with her customary grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Early as ever, Naomi. The other girls should be getting up any minute now. I&#39;ve got breakfast ready for everyone if you want any.&quot; Eve smiled warmly anytime she could to cheer up her friends. They were a odd mix but, she loved them all so dearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I just finished mine, I wouldn&#39;t want to have to work even harder tonight to burn it all off.&quot; Naomi grinned with an accompanying chuckle as she eased past Eve.<br />
<br />
Eve closed the door behind Naomi and made to the stove to start dishing out the plates. Naomi had her sports bag with her which meant she probably had a reason to tease Lily. The poor girl was always tormented by Naomi but, at the end of the day, they got along just fine. Eliza came out of her room shortly after her alarm as always, she was deep into her sudoku book, Eve thought about getting her a new one soon. Lily sheepishly checked who was already at the table and then went straight into Marie&#39;s room. She was such a good girl, Eve had asked her to get Marie for breakfast once and she&#39;d done it everytime since. Marie was a late night person, no doubt about it, she always played her video games well after Eve went to bed. With everyone at the table, Eve passed out the plates and settled into her chair.<br />
<br />
As soon as they were all finished Naomi revealed a very pretty little statue from her bag stating it was for Lily. Eve waited a moment before commenting just in case she... And before she could finish her thought Naomi flashed the table with the tiny woman&#39;s lady parts. Eve couldn&#39;t help her gasp at seeing the surprising detail before Naomi affixed its clothing again. Lily had already retreated to her room, Marie took the figure and wandered back into her own, and Eliza did just the same as she&#39;d be getting ready for her turn at the shower. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wish you wouldn&#39;t tease Lily so much, Naomi... You know she&#39;s sensitive.&quot; Eve huffed softly placing her hands on her hips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Sorry... I&#39;ll get her something to make up for it later ok?&quot; Naomi smiled awkwardly as she rubbed her arm. She got up shortly afterward and went into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Eve hoped Naomi was ok, wondering if maybe she had hurt herself during a work out. Turning back to the dishes at hand, she had just gotten them finished when she heard Eliza call out from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve, you left your underwear on the floor in here!&quot; Eve&#39;s voice sounded from inside the doorway.<br />
<br />
Hustling over to keep her from waiting, Eve stepped inside and saw the black underwear laying on the floor. &quot;Oh dear... I could&#39;ve sworn I carried it over to my room.&quot; She gathered up the underwear and headed for her room. The lingerie didn&#39;t feel dirty and the design was so pretty that she set the pair on her hamper for today. Eve didn&#39;t remember where she had gotten a set like that before... Maybe it was a present from one of the girls, that had to be it. There was a thud from inside the bathroom and Eve could&#39;ve sworn that she had heard the door shut again. Marie must&#39;ve snuck into the shower with Eliza today, that girl... It had happened to them all at least twice a month, Eve just let her stay and helped her wash first. Hearing the door open, Eve picked up her towel, the black underwear and a change of clothes making for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Something bumped her foot as she walked out into the living area. Bending down to collect the wet towel, she saw a small peach ball laying on top of it. Once she had picked it up to get a better look at it, she became immediately flustered at what she held. Her fingers had immediately found grip in the vagina like crevasse running down one side, her thumb had settled in a dimple that resembled an anus, and just to the side of her pinky rubbed two tiny breasts. The toy was damp as if Marie had taken it into the shower with her, with a shake of her head Eve sat the ball on the counter. She would have to tell Marie not to leave such things out where Lily might find them. It was no secret among the three of them that Eve doted on Lily. <br />
<br />
Inside the shower, Eve worked a lather of shampoo and pulled her braid loose. Only when she showered did she let her hair down both physically and mentally. It stuck to her back as the water ran down her body working the shampoo into her hair gently. She grabbed her loofah and started at her breasts with her cleaning. Everyone wants a large chest until they know what its like to carry and care for them. Reaching behind her shoulders, she stretched to ease a bit of the pain. The night before came back to as she closed her eyes. &quot;I really want to make people&#39;s lives brighter.&quot; The words had come out as she rubbed Lily&#39;s shoulders to calm her nerves. If she could have that wish she was sure she could help Lily relax for good. Maybe even instill a few good habits into Marie while she was at it.<br />
<br />
The wash eventually brought her around to her own lady parts... Ever so often she&#39;d even shampoo her bush but, most of the time she&#39;d settled for a gentle scrub of the loofah. With having to take care of her friends she didn&#39;t have time to worry about finding a boyfriend. With no one to shave the patch for she just let it grow wild. Soon came the rinse and she stepped out of the shower drying off with the towel. Holding the lingerie in her hands with one more cursory look, were they too fancy to wear now? Shaking her head, she slipped on the panties first. It wasn&#39;t often that she found just the right size but, these were perfect and the silk felt amazing. She slipped the bra on over her shoulders and paused in mental preparation for a tight fit. Even the bra cupped her breasts with a gentle caress, here the silk had caused an unexpected arousal of her nipples. She threw on the clothes she brought with her to cover up quickly before she blushed.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day had gone by smoothly, Eve had gotten her shopping done and even found time to grab a new novel for her quiet time at night. Dinner was eaten at the table by her insistence much to Marie&#39;s constant disapproval. One could hardly coax her out of her room at all beyond food. Lily never complained about having to at the table. With just the three of them the far side of the table was open for Eve to stretch out. Only one thing was odd about today, now that it was time for the evening dishes. She&#39;d never lamented about having a partner before...<br />
<br />
Laying down on her bed for a late night read before sleep, she took into account the book she grabbed. A steamy romance novel... She&#39;d never considered having one in the past but, as she read further in, she lost track of time. Every scene played lucidly in her mind, every thrust the main character made felt so real, and most importantly her lady parts burned insistently. Breath deep and husky, she stalked out of her room in the dark. What was she doing? This would never work... She, she just couldn&#39;t... But, onward she went knocking on Lily&#39;s door. Lily asked who it was and Eve tried her best to keep her breath out of her response. When Lily allowed her to come in, she did so and subtly locked the door. <br />
<br />
Eve sat on the side of Lily&#39;s bed as the smaller woman laid under her covers. Oh, sweet little Lily, how she could just eat her up in one bite. She stopped herself mentally but, the shake of her head came physically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve? Are you ok?&quot; Lily sat up and reached out to touch Eve&#39;s shoulder. That small touch, so soft and gentle broke the dam in Eve&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
In a flash, Eve had turned and pulled the covers off of Lily. The young woman seemed startled by the motion but, Eve rested a finger on Lily&#39;s lips. &quot;Shh...&quot; She positioned her over Lily and had decided that she&#39;d have to make it work between their height differences. Before she could get another word in, Eve pounced kissing Lily&#39;s so deeply they were almost breathless. Her shirt had fallen free within minutes settled by the long skirt on the floor. Lily&#39;s defenses had fallen easily, she must&#39;ve fantasized about Eve before it ever came to this. Eve was determined to make Lily feel even better than this. Starting by undoing and opening Lily&#39;s pajama top she worked her large hands around Lily&#39;s C cups. She hid them so well in her bulky clothing that they were often so neglected. <br />
<br />
Eve hadn&#39;t noticed in her sexual fervor toward the other woman that her calves and feet had since vanished. Preoccupied with kneading Lily&#39;s right breast, she worked her tongue around the left nipple with the grace of a master. Never been one for sexual activity, she wasn&#39;t certain where it had come from but, was grateful for it. By the time she had started her way down to Lily&#39;s pants, she had begun to shrink in size. She had it in her mind that it was simply so smooth that it felt like she was moving at all. Her hands pulled away from Lily&#39;s breasts opening the way into Eve&#39;s promised garden. Surprisingly Lily had kept her&#39;s trimmed down, it was good that Eve had decided tonight was for her, she&#39;d have to shave later. Holding Lily&#39;s vagina open with her thumbs, she buried her tongue inside making sure that the clit was well attended through out.<br />
<br />
Now Eve was smaller than Lily in stature, her arms fading to her elbows long ago. Lily bit her lips and called softly for Eve to keep going. Holding Eve&#39;s ever smaller head in between her legs with as much strength as she could muster. Soon her legs started to spasm and clamp along the sides of Eve&#39;s head. When Eve&#39;s tongue slid out, she released reflexively into the doll&#39;s face. She drifted off to a pleasure drunken sleep as the doll soaked in fluids, as wet patch down on its own sex. All that was Eve, was now a stumpy limbed, over sexed, caricature of herself wearing tiny black lingerie. The night rolled on and the doll remained lying where Lily left it.</p>
