<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s see how you&#39;d fare being a horse!&quot; the witch exclaimed. &quot;Much more practical than the waste of skin that you are now.&quot;<br />
Damon fell on all fours. His skull changed its shape in waves of sharp pains and dull discomforts. His members stretched and extra bones spread from the bottom of his backside. It was all so strange and frightening. The weirdest came at the level of his groin, though. A series of pressures erupted that he was incapable of stopping even though he begged for it. He couldn&#39;t even touch himself to see what was happening because his finger did not exist anymore, replaced by hooves! And his neck was now at such a long, low angle that bending tit to see what was occurring to his penis and testes was impossible! So he had to wait and feel fur cover his body, his hair recede and along a specific area conversely grow longer, while a whip-like motion and feel on his new flanks confirmed he had grown a tail. He screamed in panic as little stings were felt under his belly but only whinnies came out. And his teeth felt so big and flat! And what was happening to his groin? Bending in a very uncomfortable position, he saw with a horror impossible to describe his reduced testicles retreating into his skin, disappearing within his body with two small grotesque &#39;pops!&#39; alongside his penis who slid right into the inside of his groin, likewise with a most ridiculous whistling sound, as if it all was a hilarious comedy, the loss of his manhood. The only thing Damon could feel  pf his lost prized masculinity was their remnants churning in his insides, his penis placing itself as a mirror reflection of its own and his poor scrotum altering itself to locate itself on either side of the sort of weird tube of flesh that had been his favorite toy all during the years since the onset of his puberty. And unlike his virile and noble parts, they didn&#39;t move! They didn&#39;t jiggle and swing proudly! They were stuck inside his flesh , immobile and for no one to see! Certainly no prostitute now! The awful witch had said he&#39;d be a horse, and the only consolation for him would was to have a massive penis, proudly emerging from an impressive sheath, along with testicles that would made bulls feel jealous. But there was nothing here! Nothing at all! All he could glimpse was a sort of ugly slit. Something resembling... a wide cunt... He froze, appalled and the witch confirmed his worst fears.      <br />
&quot;Did I say a horse? A mare will be much more practical. You can make babies and make me rich! And you deserve to be punished, after all. Knowing how it feels to be a female, and going through being the one mounted and giving birth shall be most becoming for a rude, crude lout such as you!&quot;<br />
Damon stumbled, shocked both by the implications of his new body and getting adjusted to it. He moved his legs. Being on all fours, on one toe and finger was extremely strange but not uncomfortable. He could feel himself getting used to it by the passing minute. The witch magically made a harness appear with a rope and it tied itself to Damon&#39;s muzzle before he knew what was happening. The witch led him to the pasture next to her house. She told him if he was violent, she&#39;d change him into something worse, like a fly or a dung beetle. Damon didn&#39;t know if that was possible, but he didn&#39;t want to check. The witch let him loose in the pasture and Damon started looking at his new environment. It was... more interesting than he would have thought of. He trotted around, pricking his ears. Noises worthy to investigate. Nice soft hay to roll into. Good ground to trot about. And the smell of grass! He had never realized it could be so...yummy, that simple common smell.  He was about to sink his teeth into what was the most scrumptious-looking salad he had ever seen when he caught himself just in time. No! He was not a stupid horse, female or not! There had to be a way out of here! He paced around, upset to see that all the circumference of the fence allowed no escape. <br />
&quot;So pretty and young!&quot; said the witch, impressed by her spell. &quot;You&#39;ll make any big stallion gallop after you, you mark my words!&quot;<br />
At first, the mention of a stallion running after him made Damon appalled but as he thought about a humongous stallion with enormous noble parts and sweating lust and pheromones, the image went from revolting to... oddly appealing. Oddly mesmerizing. A bit intimidating, yes, but his scrotum would indicate forceful spurts of life-giving sperm. And his sheath would hold a momentous penis ready to slam into her womb and drench it with cum, increasing the chances of birthing a beautiful little baby! A baby looking like his handsomer daddy, or a little filly as cute as herself. And that stallion would smell so strong and fierce... He&#39;d nuzzle Damon and sniff his cunt, engrossed by his own scents of fertility. His love would be brutal once he mounted him but true. And he&#39;d satisfy his own female heat with couplings exuding his prowess and strength to calm down his equine needs and urges. At the thought of future mating, Damon got horny and he could feel his new vagina stretching and squeezing, preparing yet disappointed at not having a sperm-and-blood- engorged shaft to hug within its fleshy walls. Disgusted Damon suddenly was at how his thoughts had strayed, he couldn&#39;t stop his own fantasized mounting from making him prance, pace nervously and knicker in the hopes of attracting a handsome male horse. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending in which part of Damon&#39;s mind you asked, no one answered but the witch.    <br />
&quot;A little frisky thing, I see! You&#39;re taking more of the spell than I assumed! Much faster too! Now imagine yourself with a little foal in your belly!&quot; she cackled as she looked on the pretty grey mare dappled with white spots that had formerly been a man. <br />
Damon hated the witch for implanting such images into his mind. He&#39;d think about them, appalled and ashamed at the very prospect but then they&#39;d become irresistibly attractive. The image of him pregnant, especially after being fucked by a horse, a stupid beast of burden, was enough to make him want to vomit but very soon after, the idea of something alive and kicking in his belly, before expelling it into this world, did not seem so revolting. On the contrary. A little foal would be so cute and fun! It would suckle from him, adorable little bubbles of milk bursting from his mouth as he finished, looking up to him and bouncing in the grass happily. Of course he&#39;d have to carry it, but how were adorable babies made otherwise? And imagining his belly slowly enlarging with a precious little baby would move more and more would only make him love him more! But then the witch burst his sweet daydream.<br />
&quot;You are still barely more than a little filly! A young coquette, that&#39;s what you are! A little budding flower!&quot;<br />
But she quickly reassured him.<br />
&quot;Do not worry! Eat and have fun! The years will fly by as you wait to become a beautiful mare. And I&#39;ll select only the nest stallions for you, do not doubt it even for a second!&quot;<br />
Hooray! Damon reared up a bit to show the kind human his enthusiasm. She even threw an apple at him! Yum! She then started to munch on grass, her heart settled into blissful care-free activities. Th witch went away to find and punish the two other thieves, while Damon took days tip finally recall he had been human and male once. When he did, he remembered with horror everything that had seemed so normal, so natural on the moment: plopping droppings as he ate grass or oats, not caring if anyone saw him or if anyone had stood next to him for that matter, being the target of flies near his eyes or anus smeared with feces, his tale only serving as a fan for a very temporary respite and rolling on his back, showing his privacy to any seeing it. And not caring, just like urinating in the open while doing something else, eating mostly, felt absolutely normal. The flies were the worse, especially when they gathered around his anus and the remnants of his herbivores bland meals to feast on it and unbearably tickle him. He could not even wipe his own butt encrusted with feces! The indignancy of it all! In his anger, before sinking back into his ever-invading stupid horse mindset, he did wonder if the witch had caught his two cowardly accomplices or if he had been left to pay for them all. He hoped that if he witch had caught them, they suffered even worse indignities than him for being such poor pals.</p>
