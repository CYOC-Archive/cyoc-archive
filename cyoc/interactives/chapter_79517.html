<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This time, Alex’s whole body experienced the strange, pleasurable tingling sensation. ‘Maybe he’s changing me back,’ Alex thought, hoping against hope. But one glance at his shifting form proved that this was not the case. Dark brown fur had already begun to sprout all over his changing body, although it faded to a beige color on his belly, chest, and face. ‘What’s happening to me now?!’ Alex thought, his mind filling with dread.<br />
<br />
It soon became apparent what new body awaited him. Small, curved horns sprouted suddenly from his forehead, as his hair darkened and retracted until it became just another, particularly thick ruff of fur on the top of his head. His newly furry ears elongated, and he soon found that they swiveled and twitched unconsciously towards sounds. His nose thickened and became leathery, and he snorted at the sudden influx of new scents. His jaw pushed forward into a muzzle, and he felt his tongue thicken and become slow within his new visage. “MOOOOOOOO!” He cried in horror, as he realized that human speech now eluded him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, do be quiet. You’re not even finished changing yet. Sit back and enjoy the show,” the red-haired devil (for Alex was now convinced that the strange man was Satan incarnate) taunted. He was right. Alex’s furred body thickened, and his remaining clothing could no longer handle the strain. RRRIIIIPPPPP! Luke reached out and plucked Alex’s shirt, pants, and boxers from the growing animal before him. With a wave of his hand, Luke vanished the garments, leaving the former boy clothed in nothing but fur.<br />
<br />
A long tail pushed itself out of Alex’s growing backside, as the tuft of dark fur on its end twitched back and forth in agitation. His thighs thickened with muscle as his legs grew in length. His toes merged and hardened, as his feet became huge, two-toed hooves. Alex fell backwards onto his now-massive rear, letting loose another unintentional “MOOOO!” in pain as his tail became momentarily trapped beneath him. His udder bounced humiliatingly as he plopped backwards onto his ass, before jiggling vigorously as it settled into place. He felt the bone structure in his legs and arms bend and grind uncomfortably through their transition to a digitigrade stance. He held his thickening arms disbelievingly out in front of him as he watched his hands morph similarly into large, plodding hooves, feeling helpless as his fingers dissolved into each thick, unwieldy hoof.<br />
<br />
Alex finally felt as if the changes were done. Snorting heavily, he looked towards his tormenter. “Not quite finished,” he said, the malicious glint returning to his eye. With another twist of the man’s fingers, Alex was subjugated to the final indignity. His manhood, still nestled safely behind his udder, twitched and shriveled, pulling back into a newly opening crevasse. Alex refused to look, but he knew what had happened. After all, no creature with teats and a mammary gland of the size he now possessed could ever be mistaken for a male. “MOOOOOOOOOOO…” Alex moaned in despair, his mind full of denials and profanities that he was incapable of expressing.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s have a look, shall we?” Luke smiled, as Alex blinked blearily at the ginger man, trying to refocus his thoughts. With a wave of his hand, Luke procured a tall, full-sized mirror from thin air, and held it facing the newly minted cow sitting in front of him. Alex peered into the mirror, dreading what he would see. His reflection did not disappoint. He had become a huge beast of an animal, all remnants of his humanity gone. He peered dimly into his large brown eyes, his thick tongue lapping nervously at his leathery nose as he tried to find something, ANYTHING, that would distinguish him from a simple beast of burden. Unfortunately, all he could see was an exceptionally large cow, plopped unceremoniously on its ample bottom, with its hooves held awkwardly in front of its face and its legs splayed haphazardly in front of it, between which perched a truly enormous udder. Although his udder looked far more appropriate on his new form than it had before (a thought which gave Alex no comfort), it still seemed exceedingly big, even on a creature of his size. It never stood still, trembling as it rose and fell uncomfortably with each deep, snorting breath that Alex took. And he knew the second he started moving that his udder would be accompanied by much more vigorous wobbling, jiggling, and swaying, a constant reminder of his new lot in life. <br />
<br />
“Well, what do you think? How do you like your new body, girl?” Luke asked, a sly grin on his face as he examined the new cow. For his part, Alex was fighting the panic that threatened to consume him. How could this man, if that’s what he was, have done this to him? Could he truly be… a cow? One glance down at his vast udder was all the confirmation he needed. ‘Not his udder,’ he reminded himself bitterly. ‘HER udder.’ It was all too much to take, as Alex mooed mournfully.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, why the long face?” Luke said, eyeing Alex’s muzzle. “You’d better get used to it, Bessie. This is you, now. And nothing’s gonna change that until our little game is complete.” Luke reached behind his back, before quickly fastening a large, clunky item around Alex’s neck. Alex looked down, humiliated as he sees that Luke has fitted him with a collar and cow bell. Just that brief motion of his head has set the damned thing off, clanking obnoxiously.<br />
<br />
“Now, we need to get you a new name. Alex won’t do at all for a proper cow,” Luke remarked nonchalantly. “Hmmm… I know… now to rewrite reality…” Luke snapped his fingers again. “There,” he said smugly. “Alex the human never existed. Your parents only ever had one son. They thought about having a second child, but decided to adopt you instead.” He grinned maliciously, indicating through the window toward the small, red barn which had sprouted up in the corner of your large backyard. “They constructed that and raised you instead of their son Alex. Daisy, the milk cow.”<br />
<br />
The cow shook her head in anger, her ears flopping back and forth and her cow bell ringing loudly. That was not her name, and Luke couldn’t make her respond to it. Her name was Daisy! … Wait, no that’s not right, it was Daisy, damn it! With mounting horror, Daisy realized that Luke had gotten into her head. She could no longer think of herself in terms of her human name, or as a man, for that matter. Mooing balefully, Daisy tried to keep herself from shaking with anxiety, but could not, and the pronounced quivering of her colossal udder only added to her distress.<br />
<br />
“There, there. I’ll check in on you soon,” Luke reassured the trembling cow. “Be a good cow while I’m gone, Daisy, or I’ll introduce you to your neighbors’ bull when I return,” he added menacingly. With that terrifying thought, Luke snapped his finger for the final time and disappeared. Daisy the cow remained in her former home for a moment longer, before she too disappeared with a crack and found herself seated on her tremendous rump inside of an unfamiliar stall.</p>
