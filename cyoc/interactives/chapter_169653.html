<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris jumped backwards as the door to her assigned apartment opened as a figure appeared in the doorway. The figure jumped back as well just looking at her just like she was looking at her. The figure was a woman, another furry like her but not a Neko or even a feline. She was short maybe 5’3 and in her early twenties with a short muzzle tipped with a deep brown nose, her large brown eyes looked into Chris’s own blue. She wore no cloths aside from a belt because her entire front of her body was covered with short tan fur. Each of her finger nails where at least three inches long claws, however the thing that made her really stand out was the armored with what looked to be brown scales that formed a sort of spikey back that ran from where her hairline would be down the back of her head, her back, the sides of her arms, back of her legs and her tail. She would almost say she looked Asian but that didn’t mean she was originally from Asia, race change was as common as gender.<br />
“Ah…Hi?” said Chris as she raised her hand and looked at this woman, trying to figure out what sort of creature she was. She had a purse over one of her shoulders and what looked to be a rich brown health shake in the other hand. <br />
“Hello can I help you?” said the women<br />
“Yes…ah…my name is Chris…well Christina and they assigned…” started Chris only to have the women smile.<br />
“Ah…your our new roommate aren’t you?” inquired the women.<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Chris<br />
“Come on in, I was about to go get something to eat but why don’t I introduce you to everyone.” Said the women in an almost bubbly happy voice. “I am Sachi.”<br />
“Hello…if I can ask…what…are you?” inquired Chris<br />
“Well, I am Pangolin furry, I never even heard of the animal before I became one.” Said Sachi “You’re a Neko correct?”<br />
“Correct.” Said Chris <br />
“Well why don’t we head inside.” Said Sachi as she turned around to show a rather normal looking apartment, a large common area with a couch, TV, coffee table with an attached kitchen with a couple of bar stools. A sliding glass door lead to a balcony with a few chairs on it. Two hallways shot out to the right and left, she assumed that it lead to the normal bathrooms with two bedrooms, one of them would have a washer and dryer maybe if not it would be in the basement. <br />
“Everyone our new roommate is here!” yelled Sachi as the sound of multiple doors opening and the sound of moving filled the air. Chris’s new cat ears told her that there where actually three other people coming toward the center room. That didn’t make much sense, if Sachi was one of her new roommates then that would be 4 people already and she would be number 5 in a four bedroom apartment. <br />
Her answer came when two figures appeared out of one of the hallways, it was deer women who was nude like Sachi with only fur and a belt covering herself. If anything her chest almost matched her Chris own and was just out there with only white and tan fur covering her with some white fur spots in the larger mix of brown fur. She had short antlers and a short tail. Behind her came a rather large black werewolf man and judging by the smell that Chris’s new cat like nose could smell the two of them had just finished having sex so if this was her boyfriend that would make sense. <br />
She turned to look toward the other hallway as her eyes widened, kitsune came out of the hallway. She was tall but not as tall as Chris with short black hair in a bob cut, with two fox ears coming out of her hair, her long black tail moving back and forth behind her. She was mostly human aside from the tail and ears, so she wore a simple black tank top with a white short coat and jeans. She had an athletic build as Chris’s heart rate picked up a bit, she was hot and very attractive. <br />
“Well ladies, we have a Neko named Chris.” Introduced Sachi as she took over the process of introducing everyone. <br />
“This is Monica.” Said Sachi as she pointed toward the fawn, who had her arms crossed in a semi-annoyed look, likely annoyed at being interrupted. “And her boyfriend Sam, he doesn’t live here but he is here often enough.”<br />
“And I am Barbara or Barb for sort.” Introduced the Kitsune. “So what is your story?”<br />
“Well…I used to be a guy named Chris…” started Chris as she began to explain who she was and how she ended up here. There where nods all around, none of them had been men but they understood well enough. It became clear the type of girls/women she was dealing with, Sachi was the overly happy girl who loved to interact with people, Monica was the bossy girl who but she smiled every so often so maybe there was kindness in her. Then there was Barbara, she seemed the goth book worm.<br />
“Well I was going to go get some food, why don’t you help move her in.” said Sachi “Sam can you help, we could use a strong werewolf like you to help.”<br />
“Fine.” Said Sam “I’ll go get my roommates to help.”<br />
“Alright, I’ll go get food.” Said Sachi as she looked at Chris “What would you like? What do Neko’s eat.”<br />
“Normal stuff maybe heavy on chicken and fish.” Stated Chris <br />
“Grab the Fish taco is you go to that place on main street they are the best.” Stated Barbara  <br />
“Sounds good.” Confirmed Chris<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take my normal stuff and grab some food for the boys.&quot; said Monica<br />
“Would you like to try an ant slushy? They are really good and health healthy and the place I am going to makes the best.” Inquired Sachi as Chris thought she was joking until she raised her own brown shake and she could see actual ants and other small insects which looked torn apart into a slushy. Her eyes moved to the kitchen where a blender was out marked with Sachi’s name and beside it was an empty container marked mix-insects. “I make a good one, myself but this place is the best in town.”<br />
“No thank you.” Said Chris as Sachi shrugged and headed out the door. <br />
“You have to forgive Sachi, she can only eat insects now…just like I can only eat greens and grass.” Complained Monica “I used to love BBQ and the like and now I can’t have them…it isn’t fair.”<br />
“Whoever said life was fair was lying.” Countered Chris as Barbara nodded her head. <br />
“Come on your room is across from mine, lets start moving you in.” stated Barbara</p>
