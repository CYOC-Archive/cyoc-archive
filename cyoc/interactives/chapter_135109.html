<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tom and Bryan got on the elevator to their room, a huge muscle daddy and his equally as big muscle cub were exiting. The daddy bear was huge, wearing only a pair of board shorts, and definitely an ex-bodybuilder now covered in a thick layer of salt and pepper hair accentuating every bulge on his frame. Close-cropped greying hair gave way to an impossibly dense beard, just long enough to graze the tops of his muscle tits. He took the stogie has was chomping down on out of his mouth with muscular, sausage-like fingers, inadvertently flexing a huge bicep in the process, causing a huge vein to pop up, visible even under the carpet covering him. <br />
<br />
“Ya know, Cubbie, I’m gonna miss this as much as pounding that fine muscle ass of yours,” his deep gravelly voice had a hint of a sexual growl as he looked almost wistfully at the ‘gar.<br />
<br />
“Well, Pops, make sure you get a handful of the magic before you leave and we can do this whenever ya want!” the young behemoth smiled back. “I love this body almost as much as you do!” he winked at his daddy. Dressed only in a posing strap, the young twenty-something massive muscle bear started walking to his car. The size of his pro-bodybuilder quads caused him to waddle, pulling one leg around the other. Pops wondered how the boy didn’t burst in to flame with the friction from the shear amount of hair rubbing against his thighs. His bald head reflected the ceiling lights as he sauntered away, his bushy, thick, blond beard slightly showing around his impossibly thick neck. Cubbie was going to have a hard time fitting in his Prius for the drive home. He’d been significantly smaller when they’d arrived a week ago. <br />
<br />
Grabbing a handful of the pills on his way out, Pops made it to his car and realized he’d have the same problem as Cubbie, as he pushed the seat as far back as he could and folded himself into his Focus. He wondered how this trip would go as he got on the interstate towards home. Several people passing him gawked at the sight. One young boy pointed with his mouth agape as his car passed by. Pops laughed to himself - he figured he looked like a silverback gorilla crammed into a small auto. <br />
<br />
Drawing on the thick cigar clenched in his teeth, Pops thought back to Cubbie and Tank over the past week, his dick sprinting to attention. He rubbed a hand across his expansive hairy chest, but something felt off. His nips weren’t as sensitive and didn’t feel as big. He looked down and was greeted with a smaller chest now covered in jet black hair. <br />
<br />
He decided to pull off at the next exit, about ten miles up the road. By the time he’d pulled into the gas station, the mirror reflection greeting him was still a fairly hairy athletic model in his twenties. He looked down astonished that his once 21 inch arms were now barely pushing 16 as his body hair was quickly shedding. He thought of Cubbie, and what he must be going through. A slight pang at the thought of the muscle cub’s glorious dick shrinking away, he drug on the cigar still in his mouth, longingly remembering some of the encounters of the last week, and proceeded to choke on the revolting smoke. He immediately threw the gar to the ground, still coughing up the acidic smoke. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit, Stacy would kill me if she knew I was smoking that,” Joe caught himself thinking as the last of Pops returned to wherever he’d come from. He looked down, and saw the slightly paunchy, yet skinny body he’d known his whole adult life until last week. Still only wearing the board shorts, Joe hastily shuffled through his luggage, looking disgustedly at some of the hardware he sifted through. Throwing a set of beads to the side, wincing at the memory in the process, and looking under the absolutely huge plug, he found a t-shirt and immediately threw it on. In the mirror he caught a glimpse of the now youthful college face with his black hair slicked back into his usual bun. <br />
<br />
“Holy fuck that was a rush,” his voice now a register higher and lacking any of the gravel it had the past week. Looking around the parking lot to make sure he was really alone, he pulled the front of the shorts out and examined his junk. “Well, I’m really gonna miss that.” <br />
<br />
He got back into his car and re-adjusted the seat so that his feet actually reached the pedals. On the way home, he thought about the story he was going to tell his brother - he couldn’t tell him that through magic pills he had turned into a horned up muscle daddy, willingly, for a week and had some of the nastiest, raunchiest, best sex with his equally bear-ified two best friends.  Getting a bit antsy, his thoughts turned to his girlfriend, and the amazing night he was going to have with Stacy.  <br />
<br />
When he got home, he thought he was alone - his parents were out on a trip of their own.  He walked up to his room, dumping his luggage on the bed and cell phone on the nightstand. His brother didn’t appear to be around, so he went off to get a shower. Being in the dorms at college was awesome, but he valued the vacations when he could make it home.</p>
