<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William and Martha&#39;s Saturday morning had been most enjoyable, and both of them felt fairly content in things. Neither could really help thinking on how much things had changed for them in the time since their move to Moon Lake. While their marriage had never lost the love that had been between them, it had been strained by William&#39;s past infidelity and to some extent Martha&#39;s repressing of her bisexual nature. Moon Lake was supposed to let them get a new start and work through their problems as best they could without the distractions that staying in Minnesota would have brought. And while they did get a new start, it wasn&#39;t the one they expected.<br />
<br />
Both of them had become weres, William a werefox and Martha a werecat. Martha had realized just how much she had been repressing herself and William had found that the fox in him had bonded to Martha thanks to the love that had always been in their marriage. And through the entire series of events involving Yvette, William had displayed that bond that Martha could see and felt glad for. And in this, all their old doubts, fears, and pressures had seemed to vanish. Both of them loved it and everything that came with it. It had allowed to see that their love for each other conquered all and allowed for the two of them to begin to establish a rather open marriage so that Martha could be fully in touch with who she was with regards to all her desires.<br />
<br />
Though... at the moment, even in trying to arrange that had its own ups and downs as the two tried to plan through certain activities regarding Dawn and Douglass Hale, who they had met the previous day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still drawing up nothing regarding how anything might work out with Dawn and Douglass... particularly if he comes along with her,&quot; Martha gave small sigh as the two of them sat quietly together on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, dear,&quot; William gave a low sigh, &quot;but I&#39;m not real keen on male on male action... It&#39;s not... It&#39;s not that I have anything against gays... I&#39;d be more than happy to walk Nate down the aisle... or would the Ramsey&#39;s walk Alex down the aisle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s save that for when and if their wedding comes,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
William nodded, &quot;regardless... I REALLY don&#39;t feel comfortable in a situation where I am in male on male action...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and gave William&#39;s thigh a playful squeeze. That let him know that she was fine with it as they had a minor puzzle to solve. The day before, Martha had met Dawn Hale at the school in-service and been fairly curious about the werevixen, particularly as Dawn showed some interest in her. That evening, she and William had met up with Dawn again with her husband, Douglass. There they learned that Douglass and Dawn had had a fairly open marriage as well, at least for Dawn as she was one of the few werefoxes that wasn&#39;t heterosexual. Though, the issue that had them puzzled was that Douglass  came along with Dawn. <br />
<br />
That had them where they were at present, trying to plan out a way that would make that work, as while Martha was curious and perhaps even eager to see what Dawn kept under her blouse,  Martha really wasn&#39;t that interest in being with another male were besides William. She also found that in this situation, William&#39;s bond to her might be a bit of an impediment. While he admitted that Dawn was beautiful, William couldn&#39;t see himself with anyone but Martha and the fox in him wouldn&#39;t stray unless for some odd reason that made Martha happy. The fact that William was also one hundred percent straight only added an additional wrinkle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay... we&#39;ll...&quot; Martha was going to say, &quot;think of something,&quot; but the phone ringing cut her off. She sighed and moved over to pick it up. As she answered, Martha heard a very familiar female voice speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Martha... it&#39;s me, Dawn,&quot; came Dawn&#39;s voice from the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... hey...&quot; Martha answered, &quot;Will and I were just talking about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plans for some mutual fun, I hope,&quot; game a giggle from Dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Martha answered and then mouthed the word &quot;Dawn&quot; to William, though he had likely heard Dawn&#39;s voice as well, &quot;though there are some things we&#39;ve been trying to think over...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Dawn wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am bi, but William isn&#39;t,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither is Douglass,&quot; Dawn commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be a concern then?&quot; Martha wondered, &quot;I mean... if say, we invited you both over for some fun... and you and I are enjoying all the pleasures we can give each other... what would William and Douglass be doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause for a few moments before Martha heard Dawn answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no problem,&quot; Dawn answered, &quot;I face you... you face me... WE kiss and delicately massage one another and feel our passion burn as we press ourselves against each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But where would William and Douglass be in all this?&quot; Martha asked, curious and puzzled over how things would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when it&#39;s been something where Douglass and I have found a couple like you and William, William would be behind you and Douglass behind me,&quot; Dawn explained, &quot;that way, you and I having sex with each other while enjoying our bonded mate as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like more of a sex party,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you could call it that,&quot; Dawn giggled, &quot;but we&#39;ve had it so that our mates are with us and we are with each other. It is how Douglass and I have always done things... and it&#39;s always worked out well for all involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Martha said slowly with a small smile forming.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you and William aren&#39;t interested...&quot; Dawn spoke, obviously thinking that Martha wasn&#39;t keen on the idea, &quot;Douglass and I will understand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I am more than interested,&quot; Martha said quickly and ended up biting her lip as she didn&#39;t want to sound as though she was too eager. She was more willing to not only accept that she was bisexual but embrace that she was bisexual, but at the same time, she didn&#39;t want to make it look as though she was a loose woman of questionable virtue. Eventually she did manage a better answer, &quot;It&#39;s that living under the concept of an open marriage is rather new for me. When William and I married... it was more in the idea of just he and I forever...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha paused for a moment and looked over to William. He gave a polite smile to her, as he had surely heard everything that Dawn had said to Martha, or at least good portions of it. His smile reassured her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while William is my one and only... my other half,&quot; Martha continued, &quot;I had been repressing that I was bisexual. It was coming to Moon Lake that actually opened my eyes at just how much I had been repressing that part of me. And William through his bond to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Offered an open marriage to allow you to enjoy both sides,&quot; Dawn finished, &quot;Douglass did the same for me. My bond is to him and always will be... but I am bi and do fancy some fun with the fairer sex from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Martha said simply and looked over to William, almost forgetting that she was on the phone. There followed a short silence for a few moments. Dawn might have even been in something similar, as there was no answer on the other end of the line, other then sound of Dawn&#39;s gentle breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha...&quot; Dawn spoke after a few moments, snapping Martha out of a brief reverie of how Moon Lake, despite all Martha and William&#39;s misgivings on the town and its were population, had made things better in more ways than one, and in ways that they hadn&#39;t expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Martha said carefully, &quot;Our discussion got me a bit sidetracked. You called for something...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Dawn commented, &quot;with today being Saturday and no school today or tomorrow... Douglass and I were curious as to whether or not you and William would have some time for some fun. We could do lunch, talk about how we each met, and so on... and then have a little fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A grown up play date,&quot; William chuckled making Martha laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something funny?&quot; Dawn asked over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;William had a good joke on what we&#39;re arranging for the day,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and we would more than welcome a visit and some fun. Do you want us to come to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Douglass and I will come down to you,&quot; Dawn answered, &quot;we&#39;ll have nice lunch. Talk about what drew us to our mates and our plans for the future... and move on to some real fun for ALL of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll look forward to seeing you around noon, then,&quot; Martha gave smile and with that, their grown up play date was set.</p>
