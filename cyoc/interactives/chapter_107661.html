<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The white bean hit him square in the chest the chrovonic beeped and beeped for a whole minute. Then a message poped up. <br />
Transferring date to subject it read.<br />
 Stephen was so buesy reading the message he didn&#39;t notice a ripping sound behind him. His pants fell to the ground exposing his underwear which then was also cut from behind him. Stephen turned around and saw a black cord with the end of it being a tiny circular saw no bigger than a nickel. The saw then sped up and sliced his shirt off his back so he was now could be naked. Stephen like before was so perplexed as to where the cord came from failed to notice three other cords about to attack him from the front. Two black cords about an inch in diameter wrapped around his arms throwing him on to the floor with his arms above his head. The cords then pulled him up wards so he was standing up right. Stephen was freaking out; the cords terrified him he started to scream he resisted,he tried to break free, but their grip was too strong. Another cord came up to his mouth and the end of the cord opened like a mouth. It was so wide now that it it was larger than Stephen&#39;s face he didn&#39;t like the cord he didn&#39;t like it so close either he threw his legs up and tried to hit the cord but it pulled back in at the last second. Stephen tried again but not before two other black cords wrapped around his calfs. He screamed and screamed as the crod got closer to his mouth it touched his lips. Stephen felt it&#39;s warmth hug his face it pulsed sending waves of warmth throughout his body. Then a rocked of warm thick liquid was shoved into his mouth. Stephen coughed internally breathing heavily through his nose he thought he would suffocate. The top of the cord about a foot away from Stpehn&#39;s face a little hatch propped up which provided steph with air, he took a deep breath and relaxed a little bit more. The sticky substance in his moth didn&#39;t have a flavor but it was chewy and warm and thick. He was compelled to swallow it so he did. Another pulse of the mouth cord told Stpehen round two was coming . He braced himself at another blast with the force of a water hose went right though his mouth down his throat . Stephen gaged on the stuff. It was horrible. Stpehen was so preoccupied with the disturbance in front of him he failed again to look behind him. Another cord was six inches away from his anus and it didn&#39;t show any signs of going around it . He forced his hand down away from the cord wrapped around his arms and for some reason it worked he gripped the cord and tried pulling it back. The cord refused and slid right through his grip. Right into his anus. The cords split apart in his ass and opened up . That familiar pulse was again at his face again and a third blast of the cream went down his throat. Gagging again he overcame it and turned again to see a shape coming from the the tube in his butt. It looked like another wave of the substance was coming from behind he gripped the cord and tried to create a kink in between his but and the substance. But when the substance met his hand it just got smaller and smaller and got bigger on the other side of his hands and continued on it was to his Anus. He brassed himself for the pulse then the feeling of warm and stickiness penetrate his anus. When he tried to stop the another blob of cream from entering his but This time his hands were taken by cords. This time a symmetric pulse came from both his ass and mouth in harmony. He was flooded from both sides his body contracted and flinched. His belly felt quiet and it looked like it had pushed out a little bit as well and his ass looked bigger as well. The cords attached to his calfs went up to his thighs and spread his legs a seventh cords came out of now where and hugged his dick but instead of pushing creame in it sucked something out. Stephen couldn&#39;t tell what it was but he was sure it was making space for the chrovonic. After three more symmetric pulses and gagings a massive surge of never ending cream came from both cords. Stephen blacked out as he couldn&#39;t breath.</p>
