<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Ringmaster then approached Tayla.<br />
&quot;Your turn, now. As your boyfriend, well, brother, now, more accurately, is a male dryad, then you shall be the common partner of nymphs, meaning a satyr. But a female satyr, of course. A twist on an ancient Greek tale!&quot; he said, making the audience clap eagerly.<br />
He approached the ball from Tayla&#39;s face. As for Jared, he was still entranced by his new form. After all, not only was he now a male dryad, but he was also a very young male dryad and he touched and examined the plants and flowers he could make sprout and emerge with all the fascination and innocence of a child. When the ball was inches from Tayla&#39;s face, she was even less capable of tearing her eyes away from it and her attention from the Ringmaster&#39;s words. They were incredibly soothing so her mind did reflect that it wasn&#39;t worth all that great effort anyway.   <br />
&quot;Listen to me carefully. Repeat after me. You are a satyr. A faun. A female faun. You love hugging and kissing nymphs and other satyrs and, well, preparing for your future as a girl satyr that will care for children and lavish banquets. Your desire to nurture and please supersede anything. That is why you now adore nature and toys to further your novel instincts in caring and serving. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
The little girl obediently repeated, staring all the while at the shining ball. Tiny little stubs grew out of her forehead and her lower body changed utterly. Her legs became goat legs, all white with a few black spots. Her ears transformed into tufted white goat ears. The process was a little painful but Tayla didn&#39;t feel a thing. Her mind was invaded with new interests. She thought about her great life as a little satyr. That was the best! She wanted nothing more than to waive garlands of leaves and flowers, dance, sing, train to play an instruments, carry cups and platters to tables during banquets and make all creatures at these parties feel welcome. She was training with toys to become the perfect little faun lady, eager to please and serve. Dolls and soft toys were like the babies and pets she would soon have, albeit still years and years ahead. Because satyrs and fauns were all about joy in life and this joy made females catch babies. She knew that, although not the specifics, of course. And wooden and plastic cups and foods were ideal to train bearing platters of delicious foods to all the happy guests and revellers. Being the perfect hostess was fun! With games to play amongst bushes and trees and fresh ponds too! She loved dancing in circles amidst music. She hoped she&#39;d do that soon and impress everyone and... Oh! Another child was there! A little dryad boy! Playing with the flowers he made sprout. Would he accept to create flowers so they could make garlands? She hoped so, that would be so much fun! And so amusing! <br />
Both children were so engrossed in their own thoughts that they did not hear the Ringmaster or notice the crowd in the audience, for that matter. The hypnosis made sure of that. <br />
&quot;Well, shall we let these two happy children frolic and play?&quot; he bellowed.<br />
The crowd cheered its approval and the Ringmaster tapped its cane three times, leading a painted decor to unfurl from the ceiling and display itself, along with toys alongside it. The crowd gasped. It was so realistic, it looked like magic! Seeing those delightful toys, the two children rushed towards it. Jared grabbed a bowl of rose petals and threw them at Tayla in play. She retaliated and more petals fell down from the ceiling from an unknown source. Then Tayla wove many garlands of flowers which Jared grew and wrapped both him and her with these. They also played a game of pretend, Jared being the mighty king of the forest and Tayla dutifully attending him, running to fetch him platters of fruits made of wood and plastic and then munching greedily on them with much noises and comments as if he really was eating them. Tayla showed how well she could hold a plush rabbit or feed a doll, leading Jared in complimenting her skills in maintaining life and goodness in the forest. It was all so endearing that the crowd laughed and clapped heartily. The Ringmaster announced that for their great performance, both little ones deserved a reward and he made hazelnuts and almonds fall from the ceiling, which the two children picked up and munched on greedily. <br />
&quot;Now, I think it&#39;s way past the bedtime of those two little darlings. Give them a big round of applause!&quot;<br />
The audience clapped louder and the decor wrapped upon itself and vanished upwards along with the rest. Jared and Tayla hopped and skipped away towards the backstage. As they were out of sight of the spectators, a carnie blew dust in their faces and they immediately fell asleep. Another strong carnie picked both of them up before they could hit the ground and harm themselves while the first one conjured from the ground two perfect replicas of Jared and Tayla before they were transformed. They walked in great strides onto the round stage.<br />
&quot;Please give applause to Tayla and Jared! Who volunteered to remain backstage while puppets pretended to be them! What actors!&quot;<br />
All cheered and the magical clones went back to sit down, as the Ringmaster wished to all a wonderful time at the carnival. The replicas would go back home for the next night and day, be seen by everyone and then vanish the next night. Searches would be conducted but of course Jared and Tayla would never be found and the carnival evade suspicions. Magic just couldn&#39;t exist, right?And the carnival had now two new recruits who would make the happiness of their new family or families. It would take a while for them to adjust, but their young age would help. Also, nothing a bit of hypnosis couldn&#39;t help.</p>
