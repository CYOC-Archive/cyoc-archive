<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather turned around and walked back the Chronovac hoping if she could rearrange the wardrobe to fit her 36-year-old body. As 10 years are long time but Heather noticed an one small adjustment that had happened to her. She wasn&#39;t able to see the computer screen&#39;s text as clearly as she used to.<br />
<br />
Heather really had to squint her eyes and move closer to see what she was doing with the computer.<br />
<br />
&#39;Dang it, there&#39;s no way my eyesight is this bad. I have to fix it too.&#39; Heather hissed to herself.<br />
<br />
With the wardrobe matching the current body and eyesight being restored back. She wanted to check one additional thing before pressing accept. She opened the tab that mentioned her fertiliy and was horrified to see as the percentile for an additional offspring was 10%. Heather without thinking added another zero to it making it 100%.<br />
<br />
&#39;It can&#39;t be that low. I am still a fertile woman even if I&#39;m 36-years-old.&#39; Heather huffed as small sweat droplets begun to form in her forehead.<br />
<br />
Heather begun to make drastic changes to herself that she cared about. She made her hair more fluffier and lenghtier, made sure that she always had a starberry like musk in her private parts as a feature, changed her hearing to be closer what it was when she was 16-years-old and other miniscule changes that she was unhappy about.<br />
<br />
Lastly as she leaned back-and-forth in the chair. She finally pressed enter. There were at least one hundred different changes to her body.<br />
<br />
Then something happened. Heather&#39;s whole body begun to tremble like a jackhammer as the changes overwhelmed her like a tsunami. All the imperfections she had just modified to something else begun change themselves all at the same time and the clothes she wore were forcefully restoring themselves on to her body. Heather felt like her stomach couldn&#39;t handle all this shaking and audio-visual rainbow vomit she had caused herself. It was like a migraine but worse.<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s twitching was so rough that it caused her to fell down from her chair. Making a big banging noise in the process as she hit the floor.<br />
<br />
Behind the door Heather heard that Ed and Simon rushing towards the computer room and as the door flung open they both saw their mother on the floor not looking good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; They both yelled in choir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Ed screamed as Heather couldn&#39;t say or do anything. &quot;Mom! Answer me what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon begun to cry as he had no idea what to do in the situation. Heather could only lie on the floor and wait until the computer had done it&#39;s changes. Sadly she wasn&#39;t expecting Ed being so spontaneous as he took the power cord from the computer that was applying it changes on Heather.<br />
<br />
Just like that Heather stopped twitching and instantly begun to panic what would happen to her and the Chronovac if the restarted to computer or was there already some change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom. Are you... oh- oh- kay?&quot; Ed asked as he suddenly begun to close his eyes and fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
Behind Heather Simon had also collapsed near the door and in the second Heather felt a thundering jolt in her brain. She noticed both Ed and Simon getting smaller as Heather&#39;s body felt compressing weirdly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on!?&quot; Heather said out loud. &quot;The fuck? How the hell I can curse again. What&#39;s-&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon realized what was going on. It was as if the changes she had done to herself were reverting back. Heather was slowly getting younger and so were Simon and Ed. There was not time to think as Heather plugged the computer&#39;s power back on. It slowly begun to show text in the screen but as she wasn&#39;t that techsavvy she had no idea what was going on as the bright blue screen filled the screen. In desperation she hit the enter key and the computer begun to do something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it now doing. Why isn&#39;t the chronovac showing up and... UGH!!! My chest... It burns...&quot; Heather winced as she felt something inside pushing her chest inside her. It felt like someone had put ropes in her nipples and was now forcefully pulling them back inside.<br />
<br />
She then noticed that in waving motion her chest was expanding and pulled smaller. Her hips, tight and stomach was experiencing the same as all the previous changes were dissapearing slowly.<br />
<br />
Ed and Simon in other hand were getting smaller and smaller and both of them looked like pre-schoolers. She was now sure that all three of them were getting younger at the same time. Heather feared what would happened to Ed and Simon if the Chronovac was trying it&#39;s best to revert Heather back to &#39;normal&#39;. What was normal in this way anyway. Could it have been that since Heather was only one changing back it would mean that all the things she were involved with would go back in time.<br />
<br />
&#39;This means that if the boys are five and six years old that would make me 34-year-old.&#39; Heather thought as she stood up and looked the at computer. It was trying it&#39;s best to restore the settings back as it was impromptly shutdown.<br />
<br />
Heather was bit scared to think if she had to experience the childbirth in reverse and hoped that the computer would fix whatever it was doing in time.<br />
<br />
&#39;How old was I again before boys turned me into an adult? Eighteen? Sixteen? Thirteen?&#39; Heather nervously tapped the wooden table as she felt her breasts starting to leak milk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Milk? There&#39;s no way my breasts can produce milk unless...&quot; Heather said out loud and looked behind her.<br />
<br />
On the floor Simon was looking a bit too young to be a child. So Heather took him into her lap and guessed that Simon had to be atleast three years by now. Maybe this was a side effect that if Simon was truly three year old she must have breatsfeed him. Sadly she had no memories of doing those kind of activities with Simon as the Chronovac kept her original memories intact. Heather had to pray from her heart that she would have enough time to save Ed. Heather started to vividly remember flashbacks like it was yesterday how she had sex with Simon&#39;s dad as she hold Simon in her hands. It was absurd to think that some of the memories that felt like dreams were now real images inside her head.<br />
<br />
In the same moment Heather heard the computer making and sound as she turned towards the screen she saw...</p>
