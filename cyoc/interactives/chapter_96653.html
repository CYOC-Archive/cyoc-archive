<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Charlie</b> froze. The knocking at the door came again, much firmer this time as if he hadn&#39;t heard the first few then nothing. Another two rings of the doorbell later, he spotted someone on the other side of the frosted glass trying to peer through on the side of the door furthest from him. He stepped back quickly so he was no longer there in the main hall, but now standing in the dining room hoping whoever it was would leave. He wasn&#39;t himself...literally. The young man standing there in the archway of his dining room wasn&#39;t the Charlie everyone who lived on the block had come to know and get familiar with. This was a younger, much more virile version with a cock that could do serious damage now. He swallowed hard a few times then leaned forward a bit to see if the silhouette on the other side of the glass was gone. As best as he could tell..there was no one there anymore. Quietly, he started back out toward the front door so he could peer out through the peep hole to make sure whoever it was had departed and sure enough? They had. There was no one on the porch anymore, and as best as he could tell, there was no one out in front of the house. Finally, he let out a sigh of relief and turned giving himself another once over in the mirror like he had before. There was something utterly..captivating about the sight of his new body. When he was originally 18, he wasn&#39;t just skinny, but he wasn&#39;t as buff as the adonis he&#39;d turned himself into now. THIS 18 year old self he&#39;d transformed into was the epitome of everything he dreamed of being and now..by some luck of the draw..he had a second chance to see just what he was missing out on. One of his hands came up to run back through that jet black hair and once more he flexed and admired the ridges of muscle along his thighs and abdomen graced by the slightly sun kissed tan that seemed even more prevalent against a healthy frame versus the one he&#39;d had before. <br />
<br />
&quot;..Uhm...Hello?....&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice that came from further down the hallway in the kitchen archway caused Charlie to spin and fall back against the front door, startled. There, in the Archway, was Tyler. Tyler Peterson, from next door. The young athlete who was gone for summer basketball camp, was back early and apparently prompted by his parents to pick up their mail from Charlie Revellos next door. What Tyler hadn&#39;t expected was to walk in on this other guy who looked to be about his age, standing butt naked in Mr. Revellos hallway. Charlie swallowed hard then and frantically ran thoughts through his head of how he could talk his way out of this but then..Tyler spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;..Yeeaah...I&#39;m..supposed to get some mail from here?...Is..Mr. Revello here?...It should be in a basket or..something..&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler caught sight of the cock hanging heavily in front of those gorgeous thighs but he averted his eyes due to his own self proclaimed &quot;Straightness&quot;. Unfortunately, that wouldn&#39;t matter the closer he got to Charlie because of one of the many settings he&#39;d altered and hadn&#39;t initially realized the meaning of. Attractiveness. Where he rated himself about a 6 pre-change, during his tinkering he slid the bar all the way to the right to a solid 10. If he&#39;d only paid attention to the fine details that came with the newer version of the Chronivac. That attractiveness was tied into the overall control of just how much self control those who got within a certain range of him had. Gay or straight, the radiating attraction and desirableness of the new and improved Charlie Revello was not something that one could resist. He nodded then and stuttered some as he stepped to the side, now reaching down to try and cover his swinging manhood, unsuccessfully of course. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y..Yeah..Yeah!..It&#39;s uhm..there. There&#39;s the basket by the table. Let me just go and...yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
He moved along the wall quietly then while Tyler exhaled uncomfortably and made his way toward the table where the basket was sitting. The closer he got to it though..the more he felt the pull. Despite how much he was trying to avoid looking at this other guys crotch, he couldn&#39;t resist. A glance here. Another glance there. When he reached the basket, he looked up to the reflection in the mirror and finally checked him out to the point that Charlie caught the glimpses and furrowed his brows in confusion. Tyler turned then and finally locked eyes with him. Softly, he chuckled then spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm...You look like you need some help here. I mean, if you don&#39;t mind I think I can help you out..&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler took three steps forward then and closed the distance between him and the taller form of Charlie until he stood right in front of him, dragging the backs of his digits along the length of the thick cock presented before him. Charlie swallowed hard then and shifted not really knowing what to do. In front of him was his neighbors son. He&#39;d seen him countless times playing basketball shirtless in their back yard, or washing their cars shirtless as well. The lewd thoughts that rolled through his mind on all of those occasions, suddenly found themselves at the forefront of his mind and the fingertips stroking along the sensitive length of his new manhood didn&#39;t help matters. The more he stroked, the more aroused he got until finally he could feel the length coming to life in a thick swelling of muscle. The harder he got, the more the deep pink head of his cock began to unsheathe from within that foreskin until finally a steady heat radiated off of his length that matched the heat of the rest of his body. Tyler grinned handsomely then and without warning, gripped the length entirely with his hand and offered a few strokes. Charlie grunted and bit down along his bottom lip and let his eyes roll closed for a moment. When he did finally open them again?..Tyler was lowering down to his knees and letting his tongue trace along the tip of the now awakened monster trying to draw those traces of pre cum out of <b>hiding....</b></p>
