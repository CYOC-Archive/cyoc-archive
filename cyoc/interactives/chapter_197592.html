<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In this world, men were the only gender, not that this world knew what gender was. There were, however, many different types of men that could be found in the world. Before puberty, all boys had both a penis and vagina, but when puberty started, the penis could engorge or shrink, or the vagina could seal or increase its sensitivity, depending on which type the boy was turning into. Doctors could usually determine which type a boy would be by 16, which resulted in many men being considered adults at 16 after their “Type Reveal” party. Puberty usually ended by the time the man was 19, and their development into their type was complete.<br />
First, there was the Alpha type. Alphas were typically massively muscled men who stood an average of 7 feet tall. Alphas also usually sported large amounts of body and facial hair, which they had no choice but to keep as when they did shave, within a few hours they would once again have a full beard and thick pelt on their chest. They are usually defined as the leaders of society and it is considered rude to speak up against or disagree with an Alpha, even if he’s wrong. During puberty, an Alpha’s penis would engorge and their vagina would seal up, resulting in an average 10-inch long soft penis with a pair of balls to match. Due to their size and stereotypically high libidos, Alphas would usually find themselves walking around in the nude, or wearing the bare minimum. Alphas were also always dominant in the bedroom, and it was common and almost expected for an Alpha to masturbate in public. It was also considered a public service to clean up after an Alpha’s masturbation.<br />
Betas are very similar to Alphas in their build, with massive muscles and tall statures. The biggest difference physically was that instead of a large penis. their penis was usually only a nub. Instead, a Beta’s vagina would be constantly moist due to their libido. This led to Betas typically wearing no shirt and just a small bikini bottom or thong with an absorbent pad to get their leaking fluids. Betas also had little to no body hair, though also found themselves unable to get rid of a beard. While Betas were sexually dominant, it was considered rude for a Beta to turn down any offer for sex by a man with a larger penis than them. Despite their primary sex organ being the vagina, Betas were incapable of getting pregnant.<br />
Despite the Alpha’s dominance over the other types of men, there was one type that had larger penises. These were the Smalls, who were named for their smaller stature instead of the size of their penises. The tallest Small stood at only 5’2”, and were famously small physically as well. Most had no visible muscle on them, and Smalls were unable to grow any body or facial hair. A typical penis length of a Small was 1’ soft, but despite this, Smalls were incredibly sexually submissive. Smalls also still had a fully functioning vagina and are capable of pregnancy even by a Beta. Smalls typically can be found wearing things like crop tops and skinny jeans, with one pant leg being wider than the other to accommodate for their long thick penises. <br />
Even smaller than a Small was a Tiny, who typically stood around 4’ tall. Some boys would even get shorter in the process of becoming a Tiny. Tiny looked like Smalls, except for a shorter stature and much smaller penises, averaging around 4” soft. Their vaginas also stay open and are used for sex. Due to their small size, they often get mistaken for boys and so they usually prefer not to shave any body or facial hair they get, as a sign to prove they are indeed adults. Tinys would also usually stay fully clothed, wearing the same size and style clothes that most boys wear. Sexually a Tiny is vers, capable of being submissive to a dominant man or dominant for a submissive man. Due to this, Tinys are highly sought after in the sex worker industry. <br />
There are also Thicks, men who are large overall. A Thick typically had large muscles but also had a fair amount of fat on their bodies, giving them a overall barrel-like physique. They stand around 6’6” tall, shorter than an Alpha or Beta bun taller than other men. If a Thick chose to keep their body hair, they would best be described as a bear in our world. A Thick’s vaginas close during puberty, leaving the man with an average 8” long penis, usually with the thickness of a beer can. A Thick would be sexually and socially dominant with all other men except for Alphas and Betas, and in their presence would be incredibly socially and sexually submissive. It is unknown why, but Thicks find themselves only wearing clothes made of leather.<br />
Lastly, there are Breeders. Breeders tend to be physically fit and stand around 6’ tall, with only a small amount of body fat on them. Unlike other men, their penis and balls completely recede into their bodies, leaving only a smooth patch of skin where their equipment once was, and their vagina stays open. A Breeder is constantly in a state of menstruation, meaning any sex would result in a pregnancy and, as a result, are typically seen as lesser men by all the other men types. Unless they are pregnant, a Breeder is almost never allowed to refuse sex, as the only reason most other men would want to have sex with them is to have kids. Breeders are also sexually vers, fulfilling any requirement their partner needs. In an effort to seem sexually appealing, Breeders tend to wear form-fitting or suggestive clothes such as harnesses or sleeveless shirts that are a size too small with a matching pair of skin tight track shorts. <br />
<br />
Despite the wide differences in the worlds and the types of men, men with all kinds of personalities and interests existed. There were Alphas who loved to sew and knit, professional Small athletes, Betas who loved playing video games and watching anime in their free time, Thicks who had less fat on their bodies due to a good workout routine, or even an Alpha who missed the feeling of his vagina. The type of man didn’t determine their personality or interests, only their status on the social ladder, general body type and penis size/vagina, and general sexual preferences. </p>
