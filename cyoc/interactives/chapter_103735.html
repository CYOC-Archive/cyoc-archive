<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Devon, buddy, it looks like maybe you&#39;re enjoying this a little too much,&quot; Simon said, motioning with his eyes down towards Devon&#39;s boner.<br />
<br />
Devon felt himself break out in a heated sweat at the mention of it. Blushing, he grunted back, &quot;Just let me go Simon. You know I don&#39;t want this, you&#39;re doing this to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing what to you? I don&#39;t want to make you do anything, little guy. Plus is it really that bad, turning into a man? All guys end up with hairy, smelly bodies man. It&#39;s only natural. Don&#39;t you like nature? Guys in the wild?&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m only a teenager!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the time when your hormones are getting ready to rage man. The time when the boy in you gets encased in muscle and hair starts bustin&#39; its way out. Gotta learn to wrestle, it&#39;s what guys do. You want to try on a singlet? Maybe you&#39;d like how you look in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Simon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you do,&quot; Simon said, grabbing Devon under his arms and lifting him up. &quot;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d fit my old one, here,&quot; he said, strutting over to pick something off the floor that looked like a jersey. Devon didn&#39;t understand at all how guys could wear those wrestling clothes. So embarrassing, the way it clung to your body and left so much of your legs, chest, and pits exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me,&quot; Simon said in a commanding baritone that made it hard for Devon to want to pipe up and say no.<br />
<br />
Simon walked into the bathroom down the hall, turning on the light. &quot;Don&#39;t you like the way you&#39;re looking? It can&#39;t be that bad, you&#39;re still so small. Take off your clothes so I can see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Devon felt embarrassed as hell but shucked off his clothes, standing in front of Simon in just his tighty whities. Simon, meanwhile, was just bulging with muscle and fur, and was of course wearing a jock strap. &quot;What&#39;s so bad about this, Devon?&quot; he said, walking up and putting his hand on Devon&#39;s bare chest, rubbing his palm against it in a circular fashion. &quot;Don&#39;t you like that you&#39;re starting to look more like a junior or senior than some scrawny freshman? Wouldn&#39;t you want thick pecs like I&#39;ve got?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon, I don&#39;t know, I...&quot; Devon said, gulping. He couldn&#39;t help but look at the hairy muscles of Simon&#39;s chest. No way he&#39;d want that, though it was hard not to look. Maybe he&#39;d like to touch Simon to know what it felt like, but he definitely was not going to, or going to ask. He wanted to look but didn&#39;t want Simon to notice that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, what about the way you&#39;re already starting to change?&quot; Simon said, tracing Devon&#39;s pleasure trail lightly with his index finger. &quot;You think this is that bad?&quot; Simon said, a wicked sparkle in his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really but I am probably as much of a man now as I should be.&quot; Devon said, still trying to not let Simon see him look at Simon&#39;s pits and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, just put this on,&quot; Simon said, throwing the singlet at Devon, who caught it. Devon was embarrassed but put one leg, then the other into it and put the straps over his shoulders. &quot;I don&#39;t even really know how to wrestle,&quot; Devon said, looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, ok, here, look in the mirror,&quot; Simon said, putting his hands on Devon&#39;s shoulders and turning him around. Simon grabbed one of Devon&#39;s arms and lifted it up in a victory pose. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to win, Devon? Look at that, team leader to the championship right here if you just work for it a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrestling is weird, Simon, really... you know it&#39;s not my personality.&quot; Devon felt glad that he seemed to have his real personality back in control again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s weird about it?&quot; Simon said, serious all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything! All the moves, half nelsons, having to get weighed in the locker room, the way you have to show off your body all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Show off your body? Like what? Like this?&quot; Simon said, lifting Devon&#39;s arm again in a victory pose. &quot;You should flex a little, man, you might like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Devon tried to pull his arm down, but not too hard as he didn&#39;t like to go against Simon. &quot;No Simon, it&#39;s weird and embarrassing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s embarrassing? Don&#39;t you want to show off that muscle? Show off that hairy pit in victory, too? That&#39;s how jocks are, Simon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it is weird to have a coach lift up your arm so everybody can see your hairy pits, Simon! Sorry but it&#39;s not for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, take these straps off,&quot; Simon said, now undoing the singlet a bit. Remember when I said how much better you&#39;d look if you had some hair coming out of the neck of that singlet? Maybe if you tried that you&#39;d get over this hair thing and see how it gets you the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Simon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, we&#39;re going to try it. If you don&#39;t like it, you&#39;re already going to have to be shaving your pits and you&#39;ve got hair on your abs, man. So it&#39;s just a little more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah Simon, I need to get going home,&quot; Devon said as Simon started uncapping a bottle and splashing a little of a slightly musky smelling liquid in his hands. &quot;Here,&quot; Simon said, slapping the palm of one hand right up against Devon&#39;s right pec, rubbing it in and in a circle, grazing Devon&#39;s nipple and rubbing it across that too. Devon probably could have turned and ran, and wanted to as he was sweating with nervousness, but Simon was so commanding that it was hard to say no. Maybe he could go home soon and wash it off still before much, or even anything, started to happen, he started to rationalize.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon, what... ok, but we can undo it later, right? It might be ok to experience it but I can come over tomorrow and we can find a solution, right? I don&#39;t want to go to school on Monday like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Devon, later,&quot; Simon laughed, putting more in his hands and massaging it into Devon&#39;s left pec. He gently rubbed the bare skin in the center of Devon&#39;s chest while Devon looked at the strong stubble on Simon&#39;s jawline. It really was hard to imagine this was the same Simon he used to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and Devon, one last thing,&quot; Simon said as he finished up with both hands on Simon&#39;s chest, one on each pec. &quot;I need to rub this stuff off my hands,&quot; he said, &quot;here&quot;, he said, pulling down Devon&#39;s singlet further so it hung down around Devon&#39;s thighs, exposing his ass. Simon leaned down and with a loud smack, slapped his palms on Devon&#39;s ass, one on each cheek, laughing. &quot;Simon!&quot; Devon said, mad and afraid. &quot;What the hell, man?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon kept his hands on Devon&#39;s ass for a moment, rubbing the liquid in a little. &quot;You can always shave it, or try. Just give it a try, if you&#39;re going to be a wrestler you should look a little more like a real stud this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I gotta go home,&quot; Devon said, really only calling Simon dude to stay on his good side. &quot;I&#39;ll check in with you tomorrow, ok?&quot; Devon was still hoping he&#39;d be able to go home and shower most of it off.<br />
<br />
When he got home, Devon took a hot shower and got out the body wash, going over his whole body but his chest and ass especially, also spending a lot of time on his groin. Maybe he couldn&#39;t stop it, but it didn&#39;t hurt to do his best or at least enjoy feeling clean. He put his briefs back on like usual -- definitely not interested in going buck naked, boxers, or a jock -- and went to bed, reaching around to feel his ass. Felt smooth to him. Really, he could probably deal with the changes he&#39;d gone through already if he could just stay how he was, so hopefully he&#39;d still be the same in the morning.  That was still a possibility, I mean you never know.</p>
