<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Prudence lay in her bed, looking up at the ceiling, attempting to sort out her thoughts.<br />
<br />
Foremost on her mind was the Amulet of Zulo and the apparent trouble it has caused thus far. Rolling over, noting that the time was about seven in the morning and that Shannon was still asleep, Prudence peered at her vanity and the doll sitting atop it.<br />
<br />
No less then roughly fourteen hours ago that baby doll had been her best friend Geneva and Cole had been her brother and not a person who looked like Geneva. Sighing, she sat up, wondering how her brother was adjusting to the life of a girl and then wondered if she would ever have her friend back. Sighing again, prudence decided she wanted to take a shower.<br />
<br />
As she ran the water, she thought about the events that had transpired last night after Cole's transformation.<br />
------<br />
<br />
It had taken them about half an hour to first calm her brother down and then to try the amulet against his clothes, only to find out that the transformation would not reverse itself.<br />
<br />
Horrified to learn he had been not aged two years, but also to learn that he had been turned into a girl, Cole next big shock came in the fact that he was going to have to dress like Geneva and act as much as possible like the seventeen year old he had become...something that would prove easy because Cole still had his mind and memories, but Geneva's body.<br />
<br />
After going around in circles for an hour that Cole was Geneva, was a girl and that it wasn't perverted for a girl to wear girl's clothing, Shannon and Prudence managed to convince Cole to change from the clothes she was wearing to Geneva's clothes...which ended with her refusing to wear the bra and the underwear.<br />
<br />
Next problem to come up was the need to use the bathroom, something Cole had no idea how to do. And after much explanation, Cole finally had the gist of what to do in order to empty his bladder.<br />
<br />
After that, Shannon came up with the idea that if Cole was unable to return to his previous life, then maybe going to Geneva's would be a good way for Cole to learn something about the life he had been thrust into suddenly...something Prudence had agreed on, mostly because she thought it to weird for Cole/Geneva to be hanging about.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Prudence shut the shower off and wrapping a towel around her body and head, she hoped Geneva/Cole was doing okay and that the actual Geneva's parents hadn't asked or done to much.<br />
<br />
Back in her room, she toweled herself dry and discarding the towels, she began to dress herself, wondering how Geneva/Cole was handling herself when it came to showering and dressing herself. As she prepared for the day, Shannon awoke, muttered, &quot;Morning,&quot; and disappeared from the room.<br />
<br />
Starting downstairs, wanting breakfast, Prudence stopped and heading toward the bathroom, she knocked and when Shannon opened, she asked, &quot;You think we should go rescue my brother from Geneva's overbearing and overprotecting parents before going to the library?&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling, Shannon nodded and explained, &quot;I'll be down in a moment. I just want to grab a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
An hour and a half later, the two girls had set out and moving quickly, the made their way to the Plumme residence. Knocking, they were suprised when Geneva/Cole answered the door, wearing a bathrobe over a shirt that went down to the knees and had a picture of Hello Kitty on the front.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing the two girls, Geneva exclaimed, &quot;It's about time. You wouldn't believe what I have been exposed to,&quot; as she pulled Prudence and Shannon into the house.<br />
<br />
Closing the door, she said, &quot;Luckily my parents,&quot; stopped, sighed and said, &quot;Geneva Plumme's parents weren't home when I got home,&quot; stopped again and then said, &quot;When I arrived last night and that weren't home when I woke up about half an hour ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing her brother was near tears again, Prudence hugged the girl and silently comforted her as she went through her different problems, most of which revolved around the odd mind-slips.<br />
<br />
Calming down, Cole/Geneva whispered out, &quot;It is all blending together. I am having trouble separating my life from Geneva's.&quot;<br />
<br />
Attempting to comfort the girl, Shannon announced, &quot;Well as soon as you are dressed, we're going to the library to unravel this mess,&quot; as she took a seat on the couch.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Geneva looked about and then opened her mouth to ask something, but stopped and turning, she whispered, &quot;I'll be down in a bit,&quot; and then disappeared down the hallway toward the back of the house and Geneva's room.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the couch, Prudence leaned close to Shannon and whispered, &quot;I'm worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from the other girl and silently the two passed the time in silent conversation. After a half hour, Geneva/Cole was back wearing a pair of bib-overalls and a white t-shirt that clearly made her B cup look more ample then in actually was.<br />
<br />
Shifting about, she commented, &quot;I don't really understand how girl's can wear this stuff,&quot; and she took a seat on the couch and pulled on a pair of socks, muttering about breakfast.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, the three had left and where making their way to the library. Once there, they each took an internet terminal, thankful there wasn't a time length like some libraries imposed, and began to search for anything they could find on the Amulet of Zulo.<br />
<br />
Five hours later, discouraged, they decided to break for lunch and as they ate, the quickly discussed amongst themselves on whether it was worth the time and effort to continue searching.</p>
