<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not actually feeling drunk after a few drinks of the stuff that would have killed a human instantly, Casper wondered if the main point of the liquid was to provide a TASTE similar to that of booze to that a human would enjoy. <br />
<br />
512<br />
<br />
He also decided to test out the ring on the bar tender. <br />
<br />
The bar tender, against all odds, stayed human, Casper wondered if this was due to him not having an animal he favored, or it just being one the ring couldn&#39;t create. Noticing the bar had an impressive griffin motif in spots, Casper could guess it was the latter. <br />
<br />
He instructed the ring to leave a trigger that if the ring ever became powerful enough, to grant the bar tender the form of his favored beast. The ring complied with the trigger set. <br />
<br />
Given how they were in a city of at least 10,000, and they, had changed only 512, Casper was genuinely surprised how many of the patrons at the bar were Synthetics he had created. <br />
<br />
He wondered, if fertility among WAS extremely high, then they&#39;d possibly just have the common sense to abstain, and the parents of the absolute Synthetic had openly wanted a child. Not everyone in the world was a sex maniac who couldn&#39;t wait until marriage after all. <br />
<br />
He also found himself wondering, if their male and female appearances were just seemings, he wondered if their programming had to do with their sexual attitudes, or whatever it was in the mix of science and magic that gave them personality and awareness. Then again, since he had expressed his desire for the ring not to change people except &#39;make them a tiny bit more noble&#39; (as that had been an explicit desire of Casper&#39;s when he he first got the ring), he imagined the ratio of those who were into the opposite sex or otherwise would stay the same. <br />
<br />
He used the ring one man sitting by himself at the bar, and waited to see what he&#39;d choose subconsciously for himself. He ironically kept his beer belly, and his hands and feet became effectively identical lengthened into long curved claws, while his arms and legs became even longer. His face squished and pushed forward like his ears vanished gaining a muzzle. A long, lazy looking tail formed behind him, made of the same stuff as the rest of him. Meanwhile, his clothing vanished into thin air, and between his legs was a bulge of empty air. He was becoming a rubber sloth. His body became semi-transparent, with a black and white raccoon mask, and the rest of his body rusty brown. <br />
<br />
His drink became the same as Casper&#39;s, and Casper could actually SEE IT go down his throat and dissolve into nothing once inside him. The man was passive and slow going before, and still was. But he now he was SMILING. The molding line formed on his body, followed by the emerging of his nozzle, his nipples were no more, and his rear was just his tail. His skin became hairless and shinny, and his barcode appeared on his rump like a stamp of approval. Casper had never thought about it before, but the eyes of a Synthetic were as much rubber as the rest of them, but he wondered if they actually MOVED, or if the coloring on them just moved to emulate them moving their eyes as they confused their attention elsewhere, after all, they were just colored rubber like the rest of them, and from what Casper had gathered, these rubber anthros his ring had brought into existence were each a single piece of living magic latex. <br />
<br />
Casper realized, and wondered if the ring&#39;s species were expanding, since sharks, like the life guard, were NOT vertebrates, they were Chondrichthyes. Or maybe since the sharks still had bones in their teeth and jaws, they counted that way. He wasn&#39;t sure. <br />
<br />
He used the ring on the server that had greeted them before. Her feet and hands became yellow claws, and her face gained bright pink cheeks, while her back half became gray, and the front back bright yellow, her face turning into a beak and her ears vanishing. Of course her clothes vanished except for her apron that she was wearing. Her tail formed as did her barcode above her pretty rear. Her arms became wings and the rubber flinch looked ready to fly as soon as her shift was over. She wasn&#39;t wearing anything under her apron, and Casper could see her nipples were gone. <br />
<br />
A part of him wondered about changing the city&#39;s mayor, maybe test out to see if he could transform someone over live TV after all. That would be the ultimate prize. And he felt himself grow MORE excited at the mere idea at the city&#39;s mayor being one of his own kind. But at the same time, Casper was worried this might incur the wrath of the cosmic auditors that the wizard had warned him about if he tried to use the ring for exclusive-personal-political gain.<br />
<br />
As he and Ashley drank another round, Casper used the ring again. This time on a pair of teenage girls who had clearly gotten in with a cheap fake ID and were trying not to get caught.<br />
<br />
Both became a pair of rubber balloon horses girls. Most of their designer clothes vanished, along with their nipples, and anything down stairs, as their belly buttons became nozzles. Their feet became rubber hooves, and tails bloomed from their rears as their hair became styled like manes, and their faces pushed into muzzles marked by their mold lines. No one even looked at the two naked rubber horse girls. <br />
<br />
One was dark silver for her body, and light silver for her mane and tail (her mane done in a &#39;braid&#39; which was actually a part of her body like her mane and tail was, since they were still all air and rubber). She kept on the pearl necklace, but the glasses she was wearing clearly became costume glasses instead meant to correct eyesight. <br />
<br />
The other became bright pink, with her mane and tail being purple with a strip of white going through it. <br />
<br />
Their barcodes popped into being on their butts an that was that. A blur happened, and there was no fake ID, just the two teenage girls happily chatting with each other. <br />
<br />
Then again, if the material wasn&#39;t truly intoxicating, then there would be no need for fake IDs to begin with. The sloth and the pony girls squeaked as latex rubbed against their bar stools. <br />
<br />
The next man he changed became a large gold cobra, his lower waist becoming one big tail, wrapped around his chair. A forked tongue made of rubber came in and out of his mouth as his eyelid less eyes scanned the room as he drank an odd gold colored liquid that smelled almost like motor oil or engine degreaser. His barcode where his torso met his tail. <br />
<br />
A pair of women holding hands were next on his list. They became rubber horses as well, as naked as the day they were born (molded, whatever). There was nothing between their legs but smooth latex, and they had no nipples and no opening but their mouthes, their nozzles replacing their belly buttons. Their barcodes in clear display on their bottoms. <br />
<br />
One became a light yellow cream color with a pink and dark blue mane and tail with curls made into her molding with blue eyes. The candies she was chewing on became brightly colored wax. <br />
<br />
The other became mint green, with a white and gray green mane and tail, look a bit like tooth paste with yellow eyes. She continued to talk to her friend about the existence of Big Foot, the Yeti, and other cryptids without missing a beat. <br />
<br />
Guess even in a world of living balloon people, the weird was still weird. <br />
