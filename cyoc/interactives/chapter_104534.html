<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: Sorry folks. All sex scenes in this episode are either remembrances of the past or hints of the future but don&#39;t worry, the &quot;night&quot; is still young in Moon Lake!}}<br />
<br />
&quot;This chicken fried steak is good,&quot; said Melissa Stovall, as she enjoyed her meal at the Moon Lake diner.<br />
&quot;Eric introduced me to it on our first official date,&quot; said her daughter Julie. &quot;While we were eating, I didn&#39;t know Samantha Twist had come in to collect a pick up order, but she later showed me the photo she took of us,&quot; she added, before taking her cellphone out of her purse and calling up the image.<br />
The picture showed Julie and Eric standing up at the table over their meal to kiss, but not noticing that the tip of Eric&#39;s tie and the bottom front of Julie&#39;s blouse had gotten onto their respective plates.<br />
&quot;So soon and already so deeply in love,&quot; commented her mother.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a copy of that,&quot; was Eric&#39;s only response.<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; said Melissa.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make sure to e-mail one to both of you,&quot; promised Julie, while putting the phone back in her purse.<br />
&quot;Just a couple of months...&quot;<br />
&quot;What was that Eric?&quot; asked Mrs. Stovall.<br />
&quot;I was just thinking. It was only a couple of months ago that my family first moved here*,&quot; began Eric. &quot;At the time, Nate was the only one who completely embraced the concept of weres, let alone was willing to become one when Samantha told us about the mandatory were law. Now, despite the fact dad&#39;s entry wasn&#39;t under the best of circumstances,&quot; he added, recalling the rogue werevixen Yvette Smith, &quot;the Andersons are truly happy as full members of the were community, and I for one cannot picture my life any other way,&quot; said Eric happily, before giving his girlfriend/future wife a kiss on the cheek.<br />
&quot;That reminds me mom, what are you going to say to dad about us when he comes back from grandma&#39;s?&quot; asked Julie, while caressing the single pearl on her new necklace, indicating she was now a betrothed were-mermaid, despite how long it would be before the actual marriage ceremony would be performed.<br />
&quot;Well, after I do break the news to him, your father will probably want to have a private man to man talk with Eric,&quot; began Melissa, which made the young lad tense up for a moment, &quot;but the only thing I can tell him is that you two are destined to be together. The engagement&#39;s a little sooner than expected,&quot; which her mom knew was actually a serious understatement considering Julie and her beau were only 14 year old high school Freshmen, &quot;but there&#39;s no denying how happy and in love the two of you are,&quot; she added, looking across the table at the young couple.<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; continued Melissa, as she started to leave the booth, &quot;I&#39;ve got to be excused for a minute, but after we finish dinner, we&#39;ll have dessert to celebrate Eric&#39;s entry into were-merman-hood, then we&#39;ll go home and you two can go on with whatever you have planned for tonight Julie.&quot;<br />
When she saw her mother disappear into the alcove that led to the diner&#39;s restrooms, Julie turned to her boyfriend and whispered in Eric&#39;s ear, &quot;Eat hearty my love. I&#39;m one horny mermaid and you ain&#39;t going to get a moment&#39;s rest once we hit the pool later,&quot; she said, caressing Eric&#39;s cock from the outside of his pants, which made the young were-merman smile and blush at the same time.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;NATE!&quot; shouted Alex, shocking his boyfriend out of his daydreams. &quot;You were supposed to put the hot dogs in when the water came to a boil, not let the water boil over and almost put out our campfire,&quot; as his oven mitt covered hands pulled the pot off the metal grille over the fire.<br />
&quot;Sorry. Just lost in thought,&quot; apologized Nate, looking a bit downcast.<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; wondered Alex, hoping his boyfriend was okay.<br />
&quot;You. Me. Us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you that my family&#39;s move to Moon Lake* wasn&#39;t under the best of circumstances. But ever since, it&#39;s like all my dreams have come true. I&#39;m now a werewolf with a studly wolf mate and a bright promising future between the two of us,&quot; said Nate with a smile, which sounded a lot better than he got lost in thought staring at Alex&#39;s ass as he was bent over their cooler.<br />
&quot;I know handsome,&quot; said Alex, giving Nate a kiss on the cheek before sitting next to him. &quot;Being a naturally born werewolf, my biggest dream was hoping to find someone who&#39;d accept and love me as I am once I figured out I was gay. Which I have,&quot; he added, while grabbing Nate&#39;s hand in his. &quot;But if we&#39;re going to have a <i>howling</i> good time tonight, we need to have dinner first to keep our strength up, and to do so...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Put the kettle back on and I&#39;ll take care of the hot dogs,&quot; promised Nate. <i>And then I&#39;ll take care of you later handsome,</i> he promised himself, smiling at the thought of things to come.<br />
<br />
AND AT THE ANDERSONS HOUSE...<br />
&quot;So there Douglas and I were, laying in each other&#39;s furry arms after a heated bout of hot and heavy werefox sex in the forest, when this werewolf couple came upon us out of nowhere,&quot; said werevixen Dawn Hale.<br />
&quot;Turns out they had just consummated their relationship, with him just making her his she-wolf in the process. But with both of them being relatively new to were society, since he had just experienced his very first transformation only a couple of months ago, neither of them knew what all the noise was about,&quot; added her husband Douglas, sitting at the Anderson&#39;s kitchen table in his full werefox fursona.<br />
&quot;But rest assured, before sunrise, those young kids got a full education and had a howling good time,&quot; said Dawn, as a smile crossed her furry muzzle.<br />
After a hot (sort-of) foursome, the Hales and the Andersons had decided to take a break and have dinner together. Two male werefoxes, a female werevixen, and a lady werecat were now sitting around talking like old friends, despite the fact they had know each other less than two days.<br />
&quot;So, if I can ask, what&#39;s your most embarrassing sex story?&quot; wondered Dawn.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Martha, her whiskers twitching as she looked at her husband.<br />
William just simply held out his paw to hold his wife&#39;s and smiled.<br />
&quot;Martha and I met in college. You have to remember we were normals back then. We were set up by mutual friends on a blind date, hit it off immediately, and even got down and dirty, as you would say that very night,&quot; happily recalled William. &quot;Neither of us were virgins, but we learned some plenty interesting things about sex and each other that night.&quot;<br />
&quot;And...???&quot; prompted Douglas.<br />
&quot;The next morning when we went out for breakfast, we ran into the same friends who set us up, but it turned out we got the wrong dates!&quot; revealed Martha. &quot;William wasn&#39;t the guy I wasn&#39;t supposed to be meeting, and I wasn&#39;t the girl he was supposed to hook up with that night, but by then it didn&#39;t matter; because we had already fallen in love,&quot; she added, before giving her husband a peck on his furry muzzle.<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; exclaimed Dawn with a giggle. &quot;So what happened to the other couple?&quot;<br />
&quot;Other than the fact they didn&#39;t last past dinner, nothing as far as we know,&quot; answered William.<br />
&quot;That is too funny,&quot; agreed Douglas. &quot;A very happy accident for the two of you. Cheers!&quot; he said, raising his glass and drinking what was left of his milk.<br />
&quot;So. After I clear the table, who wants dessert?&quot; asked Martha, standing up to start collecting plates. &quot;I&#39;ve got an unopened container of ice cream in the freezer.&quot;<br />
<i>And after dessert, how about some &quot;dessert&quot;?</i> wondered Dawn with a smile on her muzzle, staring at both William and Martha Anderson, because the only thing the orgy lacked to be complete was an actual switching of partners. Something Martha had yet to agree to. <br />
