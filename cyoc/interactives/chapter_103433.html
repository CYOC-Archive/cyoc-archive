<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Like a toothpaste coming out of its package, Vincent and Randy&#39;s dicks were growing under the water. Everybody was aware of what was happening. In a matter of seconds a decent couple of teenage dicks had grown to titanic size. They were as big as Luke&#39;s one which was ridiculous big enough to handle.<br />
I think you&#39;re happy, now. Luke said. Now, you&#39;re freaks too!<br />
Hahaha! Vincent said. We weren&#39;t going to let you be the only salami in the pool. Look Randy, I&#39;m as big as you!<br />
Don&#39;t say that! Randy shouted. I will always be the bigger one!<br />
I think you three have the same size... Kenny interfered.<br />
Maybe that is the transformation limit... Nick said.<br />
No! I can&#39;t be the same size as them! Randy said. Quick! Let&#39;s measure us!<br />
It&#39;s obvious that we are the same size. Luke said. It&#39;s useless to compare us.<br />
No! Randy shouted and then he took Luke&#39;s and Vincent&#39;s salamies with his hands. They felt heavy and meaty on them like if he was holding real salamies. He put the dicks close to his and tried to compare them.<br />
We told you! Nick said. You&#39;re the same size, I think the same shape too.<br />
What? Luke said. How is that possible?<br />
If you&#39;re talking about our circumcisions... Vincent said.<br />
No, look at your dick&#39;s head. Nick said. They&#39;re the same color, the same mushroom shape, everything like if you have twin&#39;s dicks.<br />
No! I&#39;m unique! Randy shouted. I don&#39;t even look like my little brother, right Josh? Josh? What are you doing, moron?<br />
But Joshua didn&#39;t respond.<br />
Are you alright? Josh? Raul ask him but Joshua was giving back to the other ones. When he turned out, he was holding his stomach like if he was suffering pain in there.<br />
I.. I don&#39;t... feel good... Joshua replied. I feel hot.<br />
We are in the pool, are you sick? Randy replied but Joshua didn&#39;t said anything to him.<br />
My feet... my head... I feel hot everywhere... Joshua said.<br />
Maybe the virus is mutating. Luke said. Everybody, stay back!<br />
Everybody moved back to a corner in the pool leaving Joshua alone in the center. He was shacking like if something was moving inside of his stomach and suddenly and unexpectedly he made a loud and big fart that create a big wave in the pool. All the other guys closed their eyes in order to protect them from the water that was going to their faces.<br />
The first one who opened his eyes was Nick and what he saw was unbelievable. Instead of a blonde 12 years old kid there was a guy around the same age as Randy or Luke. It was definetely Joshua, but his body was completely developed to pass as a kid. He was as tall as his brother, with sharp muscles on his arms and manly pecs on his chest, which has a modest body hair to cover it. His face was familiar to him, but defenitely more mature, squarer and with a subtle shadow on it. His hands were manly and big, enough big to be a professional swimmer. And, down the water he was similar like upside. His legs looked strong and muscled, able to kick a palm tree and let it drop some coconuts. His feet were very big, maybe a 12 size, very useful to swim too. But, the most surprising thing was his dick which had grown to match his brother&#39;s one. His balls, which had passed inadvertent before was like too eggs. Covered in hair like his crotch and his stomach.<br />
What?!! Kenny cried.<br />
Ahh! Joshua said. I feel better!<br />
He saw at the guys and noted that everybody was looking at him.<br />
What? He asked. What happened?<br />
His funny voice, too deep for a kid was very appropiate for how he looks now.<br />
Is that you, Joshua? Luke said.<br />
Yes? Why? Joshua asked. Did I turn into a monster or something like that? And why everybody is smaller than before?<br />
No! We&#39;re not smaller. Nick said. You&#39;re bigger.<br />
Am I bigger? Joshua said and then he saw his reflection in the water. He saw that he had turned older like his brother and his body was way bigger than before.<br />
My... my... He tried to say but screamed instead. Aaaaaaaahh!!!<br />
You don&#39;t look bad, little... erm, brother. Randy said.<br />
You look like twins now! Vincent said.<br />
And the same dick as I said before. Nick pointed out.<br />
Gross! Raul yelled. He has grown hair on all his body!<br />
That&#39;s your destiny, little bud! Haha! Randy said to him. Come on, bro! Show us those bushy armpits!<br />
Joshua was embarrassed of being the center of attention, this new body was completely alien to him and he was showing it to everybody in the pool, even his new member which was like a meaty and heavy salami now.<br />
Come on! Randy said. If you don&#39;t do it I will help you!<br />
And Randy went to where his brother was. He struggled more than before to take control on his brother, but finally he won as Joshua wasn&#39;t completely accustomed to this new body. Randy took Joshua&#39;s arms and he raised them revealing two big patches of armpit hairs under Joshua&#39;s arms. They looked like if they had been there for years instead of some minutes ago.<br />
Wow! Bro! Randy said. Look at that ass!<br />
And he turned his brother to show everybody his brother&#39;s new bubble but, solid and strong as you could expect.<br />
I would be jealous of you if I wasn&#39;t to handsome! Hahaha! Randy said.<br />
It&#39;s enough! Joshua shouted and he pushed his brother who fell under the water. Stop looking at me!<br />
It&#39;s imposible. Luke said. This is completely unbelievable, what do you expect?<br />
I don&#39;t know... Joshua said. Keep talking about your dick competition or something else instead of me!<br />
Well, now we have four men for a real dick competition! Vincent said. And with our new sizes this could be more interesting than before!<br />
But I had told you that your dicks looks the same... Nick interfered.<br />
It doesn&#39;t matter. Vincent said. Come on, Josh! Come to play with the big boys!<br />
Joshua didn&#39;t know what to do, so he agree to play.<br />
Wow! Vincent said. You have a very well salami over there, as fatty and meaty like real men must have!<br />
Joshua became red in embarrassment.<br />
What are you waiting for? Vincent said. It&#39;s dick time!</p>
