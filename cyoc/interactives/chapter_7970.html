<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Who can say if Myron Fuller tried to tell his dear wife of the terrible morning he experienced. Yet how would anybody tell their spouse about such fantastic going's on as he had witnessed and allowed to come true.<br />
<br />
As for the Professor Simmons his conscience was clear of any wrong doing, &quot;those people were a hazard and had to be silenced!&quot; is what he'd said. Then to he had wished a wish to the Medallion expecting his friend to get ready for bed that night and see a physical warning. A warning if he told what he knew his family and he too would be part of his Uncle's livestock out in Wyoming.<br />
<br />
A long evening at his computer produced nothing in useful information which would give Myron hope of bringing Simmons' rain of terror to a halt. Who could he turn to, he sat mulling about till his wife suggested he looked exhausted and he should retire for the night.<br />
<br />
Simmons was sitting up late that night awaiting a frantic phone call from Myron. As the hall clock bonged midnight Professor Simmons started to laugh. The Medallion hung over his chest felt warm and even through his shirt he could see it glow. This meant that it's curse was working on someone, that very moment. He laughed and waited for the call of a man rapidly changing in a bovine form.<br />
<br />
Bong! One O'clock.<br />
<br />
Bong, Bong! Two O'clock.<br />
<br />
Bong, Bong, Bong! Three O'clock. Simmons was beginning to sweat.<br />
<br />
Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong ! Four O' clock, now he really wondered why he had not received a call from the man half changed to bull. Down to his car he ran and out into the dark and quiet street his car roared. He was feeling very worried as to what went wrong, what could have happened to the Medallion's curse?<br />
<br />
The scream of a Police car's siren reminded Simmons of laws made for the roadway, such as speed limits. As he pulled over the Police car spot light hit his car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step out of the vehicle please!&quot; ordered the Officer.<br />
<br />
Simmons' sat for a minute, then the order was repeated but louder and with a note of fear. As he opened his door and faced the Officer that spot light blinded him. Simmons raised his hands to block the bright light and asked the Officer, &quot;What did I do wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh let's start with 60 in a 25 zone and maybe your drunk too!&quot; the Officer replied. &quot;What's the rush this time of night?&quot; he asked Simmons.<br />
<br />
Now things were not going too well and he had to get to Fuller's home and check on the Medallion's curse of his friend. Here he was doing a test and blowing into a bag to check if drunk. The Officer was seeing a man with some troubles, and asked more questions till Simmons was ready to explode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look damn it, this is enough! I'm not drunk and need to get to a friend's home! He's not answered my calls and I was worried for his safety!&quot; stated Simmons.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your friends name and address, I'll dispatch a Police car there to check, but you will learn to slow down!&quot; said the Officer as he took out his ticket book.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have time for this!&quot; muttered Simmons as the Office leaned against the patrol car and wrote the ticket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please may I go now?&quot; asked Simmons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Your too upset to be driving, I'm taking you home in my car and having a wrecker move your car to the impound lot!&quot; replied the Officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! You won't be doing that!&quot; yelled Simmons now in a rage.<br />
<br />
The Officer stood up and stepped closer to the Professor. &quot;You will do as I tell you or I'll have to make an arrest!&quot; said the Officer showing his authority.<br />
<br />
Simmons turned around and started to climb back into his car. The Officer blocked the closing of the car door with his hips, as Simmons glanced up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Sir, don't make this into a big deal!&quot; asked the Officer to Simmons.<br />
<br />
As many a time before the Professor clutched his wondrous Medallion and as his left hand touched the Officer's hand that held the car door open he made a wish. &quot;Let me go Officer or you will be a state bull is what you'll be for the rest of your damned life!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Officer was not in the mood for threats. As his right hand took a firm hold on Simmons left shoulder the Medallion glowed and one Policeman screamed.<br />
<br />
Falling to his knees the Officer was stunned from a surge of pain. A look on his face told the terror he felt as the pain flowed through his body. As Simmons turned in his car seat he gave a soft push to the Officer's chest with his foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm in a hurry and can't wait and watch you ultimate thrill! Oh be assured Officer, a State Bull you were is the best Bull at the State Fair you'll be by next year!&quot; cursed Simmons to the rapidly changing man.<br />
<br />
Simmons eased the Officer away from his car and as he sat in the seat and closed the door he looked toward the moaning man. The terror filled eyes of a man racked with pain looked back at Simmons. The growing hair of the bull he was soon to be had covered his face as nostrils expanded. <br />
<br />
Starting the car, Simmons turned on the air conditioning and took time to adjust his review mirrors. Then a casual look again to the Officer he smiled as the car shifted into Drive. &quot;See you at the Fair Officer!&quot; said Simmons in a nasty way.<br />
<br />
As his car drove off the man laid in the road till his pains subsided. Then able to move he limped back to his Patrol car and taking the radio in his changing hand he sent out an &quot;All Points&quot; on the Simmons car. It was as his voice began to change and the dispatcher heard the groaning on the radio a terror filled man slurred his last human word and began to Bellow as the prize Bull he would soon become. <br />
<br />
It happened that Simmons made it to the Fuller residence just before the Police Squad car. Running up the front walk he started to knock at Myron Fuller's door.<br />
<br />
Upstairs lights popped on and the sound of foot steps coming to the door made Simmons beat on it all the more. The door opened to Simmons and he looked into the tired face of Myron Fuller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simmons, what on earth are you doing now?&quot; asked an angry and sleepy Myron.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was worried when you didn't call at midnight!&quot; replied the wild eyed Simmons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Midnight, oh that little curse you hoped would make me bow to your evil will, huh! Well I expected as much, had to sleep in the spare bedroom too! Yup, the Wifee' didn't care for the little Garlic hung about my neck just because I know the likes of you! See!&quot; said Myron as he held up his sprig of Garlic attached to a piece of red yarn, and hung around his neck.<br />
<br />
The flurry of Police cars roared up in a flurry of dust and squealing brakes. Simmons stood rigid and scared as the Police took a hold of his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a warrant for your arrest, Professor Simmons!&quot; stated one Officer.<br />
<br />
Myron stood there in his plaid PJ's and said, &quot;Excellent Officers, excellent, I'll take my personal Medallion back from this crook!&quot; As Myron reached over he took the Medallion. &quot;Thank you all this was a personal prize of mine and he isn't taking it from me again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no it's mine, it's mine!&quot; yelled Simmons as he was dragged kicking and screaming to the Police car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be around on visiting day, till then, good night!&quot; said Myron as he closed the front door and took off his garlic.<br />
<br />
The ride in that Police car was no doubt a terror filled few minutes. Simmons' listened as the Officer's spoke harshly about him as if he'd killed the Officer who wanted to give him the ticket. He began to sweat bullets sitting in the hot rear seat, hand cuffed, and wondering how he'd ever get back to where and what he was again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down back there!&quot; said an Officer to Simmons.<br />
<br />
Simmons watched as the Police car came to a stop near the sight where he was stopped a little while ago. Several Officers stood about, some holding torn clothing, shoes, and the ticket book with Simmons information still fresh on the page. Off in the distance Simmons heard the bellaring of some lonesome bull, as a evil grin came over his fat round face.<br />
<br />
The morning Gazette told of the mad chase to apprehend Simmons. It told of his fight with an Officer. The details were unknown at that time but the missing Officer's body was not to be found. On the back page in lost and found was a notice of one Polled Hereford Bull being held for it's owner at the Killingsworth Ranch.<br />
<br />
Professor Simmons sat back on his cell's cot and read and read the notice of finding a bull who wandered way from where it lived before. As Jail Guards listened and watched Simmons would break out into a roar of laughter every time he read the lost and found over the next few days.<br />
<br />
Bing, bong, went the door bell at Professor Myron Fuller's two days after the assault and arrest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Professor Fuller, I'm Frank Emmons, Professor' Simmons class aide! May I come in, I want to tell you many things about our trip to Brazil and what followed!&quot; said Frank looking rather upset.<br />
<br />
Professor Fuller opened the front door and with a comforting smile ushered the young man in for many questions.</p>
