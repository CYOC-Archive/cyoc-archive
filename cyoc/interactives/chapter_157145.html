<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey wish boy what you thinking about,” Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
Joey turned to see Melissa exiting the bathroom dressed in a white robe with a towel wrapped around her head. “Nothing really,” he shrugged. “Just wondering what else we should do?” Melissa smirked impishly as she now sat down on the couch, stretching her legs out onto Joeys lap.<br />
<br />
“So you still want to mess around huh,” she asked. “So what you thinking? Try some more stuff here? Head out on the town? What?” Joey shrugged, he really didn’t know what else he could do? He had made a woman naked, changed Melissa’s jewelry, even shrunk Melissa down to only 11 inches tall. What else could he do. As he turned to look at the woman, he couldn’t help but notice Melissa’s robe. The last thing he had expected the girl to wear was a white robe. <br />
<br />
“What are you grinning about Joey,” Melissa asked furrowing her brow.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t expecting the robe,” Joey chuckled. “Didn’t think you owned anything that white.”<br />
<br />
“Oh ha ha wish boy,” Melissa teased. “You know for your information I’ve had this old thing for quite awhile. Probably the comfiest thing I own and has been for years.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Joey said raising an eyebrow. “Didn’t think a girls robe was that important.” Melissa shook her head as she chuckled softly. “Joey, Joey, Joey,” she sighed. “A girls bath time routine is one of the most important things in her life. Least that’s what I’ve always thought. Even when I was a kid had to have my comfy robe.” Joey nodded as he turned Melissa’s phrase over in his head. An idea began to form in his head, what was Melissa like as a kid. “I think I have an idea on what to do Melissa,” he said. “You game for another change?”<br />
<br />
Melissa grinned broadly, rubbing her hands together as she rubbed her feet on Joeys lap. After her last bit of changes she wondered what he had in store for her now. “Oh this could be good,” she smiled. “After that though lets hit the town.” Joey nodded promising they would go out for some fun afterwards. First thing was first though, he wanted to see if he could change Melissa just one more time. As he made his wish he now watched in nervous anticipation, smiling as he noticed the first subtle signs.<br />
<br />
Melissa felt the power course through her body and now anxiously awaited what Joey had in store for her. As she gazed at herself she frowned, nothing seemed to have changed. “What gives wish boy,” she exclaimed. “I thought you were going to do something?”<br />
<br />
Joey smirked at the exasperated woman, noticing her face appeared just a bit fresher than before. “Oh I’m doing something Missy,” he smiled. “Just taking a moment.” Melissa looked at him curiously, cocking her head as she looked at Joey. Missy? What was she some kid? As she was about to say something she felt the robe shift on her slightly. Looking herself over she could see that it appeared maybe a tad looser than usual. Even stranger it looked like her breasts were a little perkier. “What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Oh nothing,” Joey stated in mock surprise. “I am curious though Missy. You did say you graduated college right?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I graduated you yutz,” Melissa exclaimed. “The hell are you getting on about?” Joey stifled a laugh as he now wished for a hand mirror. Handing it to Melissa he could see the woman gasp in shock as she gazed at her appearance. Melissa looked like a girl of 20 again. The girls face was fresher, youthful, more innocent with wide eyes. The stern and fierce look Joey had grown accustomed too had lost all of its bite. As Melissa stared in shock at her appearance she could see the girls face growing even younger.<br />
<br />
“What the hell your turning into a kid,” Melissa exclaimed as she reentered her teens. “Your not one of those guys that’s into school girls are you?”<br />
<br />
“Jesus no,” Joey exclaimed as he saw Melissa renter high school in the opposite direction. “Just wanted to see if I could do it.”<br />
<br />
Melissa frowned as she now looked her body over. She could now see her curves melting away as she became a skinny teenage girl once more. “Yeah well it looks like you can,” Melissa said, wincing as she began to notice her voice rising in pitch. “I just hit my sweet 16 in the wrong direction. You want stop sending me backwards, my robe is starting to get a bit loose.” Joey looked at the young goth teen, noticing that indeed Melissa’s robe was growing looser. The sleeves of her robe were resting slightly lower on her hands while the neck was beginning to slide, exposing more of her shoulder. What was even more amusing was Melissa’s herself. It appeared Melissa was growing more uncomfortable the younger she got. The confident woman in her mid twenties replaced by a teenage goth girl still trying to find herself.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Joey mused. “Kind of want to see what little Missy looked like.”<br />
<br />
“That is so not fair,” Melissa whined, shrinking back into junior high. “Cmon Joey, my boobs are getting smaller and I’m skinny as a twig. I can’t be more than what 14! 13! I’m reliving puberty in reverse. Do you have any idea how much that sucks?”<br />
<br />
“Probably a lot Missy,” Joey chuckled. “But I do kind of want to know, what was Missy like as a kid? Were you always the badass I think you were or were you a good little girl?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Melissa whined, dropping down to 12. “Cmon Joey I’m not even a teenager anymore. I don’t want to be a little girl, I want to be a big girl.” Melissa threw her hands over her mouth as she uttered that sentence. Melissa was feeling more childish by the second as she shrank back further into her childhood. She remembered it far too well. She was shy, awkward, she never got invited to any of the girls birthday parties. The kids in elementary school always called her Wednesday Adams. It didn’t help she was so quiet and really bad at making friends. Looking in the mirror Melissa gasped, she couldn’t be more than 8 years old now.<br />
<br />
“Okay I’ll talk,” Missy whined as she shrank back to 7. “I was shy, I was awkward. The kids thought I was creepy because of my hair and pale skin. I was a geek.”<br />
<br />
Joey gaped at the girl as she continued to grow younger. Melissa appeared to be 6 now and was racing towards 5. Melissa’s white robe had practically engulfed the young girl now, the neck hole resting on her tiny shoulders, while her tiny legs and feet were quickly retreating inside her robe p, which looked more like a blanket than anything. “I don’t know what those kids were thinking Melissa,” Joey said warmly. “You were a cute kid and I’ve lays thought you were cool.”<br />
<br />
The tiny goth 6 year old smiled before gasping in surprise as she shrank back to 5. “Um Joweey,” the tiny girl lisped. “Can you stop making me wittle. I tink I back in kin da gar dun now.” Joey chuckled, stopping Melissa’s regression before smiling at her. Melissa now looked like she was ready for her first day of kindergarten, her eyes wide and innocent while her hair hung to her upper back. Melissa gathered her blanket sized robe around, staring up at the adult Joey. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t know you had a lisp as a kid,” Joey chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Shut up wish boy,” Melissa lisped. “You got to see me as a kid. Now can you grow me up pwease?”<br />
<br />
Joey smiled as he now made a wish.</p>
