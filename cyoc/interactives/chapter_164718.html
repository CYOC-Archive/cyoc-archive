<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was getting late in the day, and Alan was getting antsy. He had an idea since they figured out how the book worked and he was incredibly excited to try to do so. Unfortunately, he knew his parents would not be thrilled about it, so he kept it on the down low. He asked them to use it to make his best bud from school Paul into a much taller, more athletic person and they were totally in for it, thinking that Alan was doing a nice thing for his friend.<br />
<br />
Of course it was nice, but that was just to get them off his scent. Once he was home, he made sure his parents were busy. Janet was with Stephi in the yard, and it looked like Janet was chatting with the dog. Alan always found that funny. Next he found his dad, George, was still in his office, finishing up some work. Feeling safe, he grabbed the book from it&#39;s stand on the living room table and ran to his room.<br />
<br />
He placed it on his bed and began searching.<br />
&quot;Okay relationship, relationship, relation-&quot; He silently mumbled to himself when a voice from behind nearly made him throw the book in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; The voice asked.<br />
<br />
Alan turned and he sighed in relief to see only Megan standing there, although she looked incredibly pissed.<br />
&quot;Buzz off Megan, I&#39;m just gonna use the book quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you heard what Mom and Dad said, we can&#39;t use it on our own!&quot; She snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, this thing can make certain people aware and unaware, they won&#39;t even notice anything is wrong.&quot; He explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what it is or I&#39;ll scream.&quot; She threatened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine twerp.&quot; He sighed. &quot;There&#39;s this girl at my school who I... like.&quot; He explained, blushing slightly. &quot;Her name is Angela and she&#39;s this smart, pretty Red head... but she&#39;s dating this super ass Tyler. Sooooo, I thought I&#39;d swap relationships with Tyler so i could be her boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a terrible, stupid idea.&quot; Megan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah what, what&#39;s so bad?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;For starters, if you swap relationships then we won&#39;t be your family and you won&#39;t have the book, but Tyler will. Second, it only swaps relationships not personalities. Maybe you get her as a girlfriend but only for a second before she dumps you. If you want to date her, how about actually learning about her more? Get to know her.&quot; Megan snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s such a typical girl response.&quot; Alan groaned. &quot;I guess I get your points though... but how am I supposed to get to know her without the book? Tyler would kick my ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan got a smile on her face as a light build went off. &quot;I didn&#39;t say NOT to use the book.&quot; She said with a smile as she grabbed the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, what&#39;re you- *FLASH*- doing.&quot; Alan quickly covered his mouth as his last word came out sounding incredibly girly.<br />
<br />
Alan saw some wavy blonde hair fall in front of his eyes. He lifted his hands off his mouth to see dainty, skinnier hands which had red painted nails. He gawked downwards at the two lumps staring back at him, and he felt an obvious absence below the waist. He ran through his now much pinker room to a large mirror, and what stared back at him was a girly girl version of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What. Did. You. Do!?&quot; Alan yelled, which only came out as a less than intimidating, whiney voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, you said it was a girly plan, so I guess I&#39;d help you out.&quot; Megan smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just did this to punish me.&quot; Alan growled, spitting slightly as his new long hair fell in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;No doofus, I&#39;m helping you.&quot; She explained. &quot;Notice anything?&quot; She asked, pointing at the wall. <br />
<br />
Alan turned and his jaw dropped. It was a hanged photo of a recent visit to the beach. It used to show him and his buds, but now showed his female self in a bikini surrounded by other girls from school, and the one right next to him in the picture was Angela herself.<br />
&quot;Wh-what?&quot; Alan gasped. &quot;Girl me is friends with Angela?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, so, do what girls would do. Have a sleepover, get to know each other, talk about boys?&quot; Megan chuckled, thinking of her brother gossiping as a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I don&#39;t enjoy... this,&quot; he said, grabbing his new boobs. &quot;I must admit, it&#39;s a good idea.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome sis.&quot; Megan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t push it twerp.&quot; Alan scoffed before falling on his bed. &quot;Oooh, man why does girl me get a comfier bed?&quot; He whined.<br />
<br />
Megan laughed. &quot;Look have fun at your sleepover &#39;Alana&#39; and a reminder, only you and I are aware so don&#39;t forget you&#39;ll have to sneak to change back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... I got calls to make I guess.&quot; Alan sighed, pulling out his now glittery phone.<br />
<br />
Megan walked down the hall with the book under her arm. She was super happy how that had gone. Alan would get a taste of being a girl, and simultaneously get what he wanted. She couldn&#39;t have planned it better herself. She was about to place the book back and be on her was the a voice rose behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there young lady.&quot; A deep voice rose behind her. Megan turned to find her father right behind her. Before she could even do anything George swiped the book from her. Only then did she realize how this looked for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, dad, it&#39;s not what you think...&quot; She tried to begin to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even try, I caught you red handed honey.&quot; He scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but it was Ala-&quot; She started before finding herself frozen in place. George shut the book and smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t drag your sister into this Megan. I found you with the book walking out of your room, all on your own.&quot; He said. Megan tried to move but found herself completely stuck. There was nothing she could do until her dad un froze her in time.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what should the punishment be...&quot; He began to wonder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, um... daddy?&quot; Alan shouted from down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes princess?&quot; George called back, loving when his daughters called him daddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it ok if I have a sleepover tonight with some of my friends?&quot; Alan asked, trying to sound more innocent to get what he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure baby!&quot; George called back. &quot;Well, normally I&#39;d hate those, but I&#39;ve got an idea.&quot; He said to the still frozen Megan.<br />
<br />
Megan couldn&#39;t do anything as a flash engulfed the room. She opened her eyes again and found herself nearly eye level with her own father. &quot;Oh god, dad you didn&#39;t?&quot; She thought horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, I made you a boy. I love you girls but I always wished I had a son. So, instead of watching over the millionth girly sleepover, I say me and you go to the baseball game tonight. Just me and my boy.&quot; He explained. &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t think you&#39;re gonna weasel your way out of this, I made it so that even though you&#39;re aware inside, you can only act like a boy on the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan felt her body tense up, before releasing agin. She suddenly felt her body again, and was grossed out at suddenly having that between her legs.<br />
&quot;Dad, this is so awesome, I can&#39;t wait to go!&quot; She found her deep voice saying, despite trying to complain about hating baseball.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and don&#39;t worry... Mark, we&#39;re both the only ones aware so let&#39;s go out and watch some ball!&quot; He laughed, grabbing Megan by the arm.<br />
<br />
Megan sighed, realizing that she&#39;d just have to suck it up and endure the rest of the night. She couldn&#39;t wait to see the look on Alan&#39;s stupid face when she could finally explain to her dad who was really trying to use the book. Meanwhile, Alan was pissed that his brother was going to the game while he was gonna be a girl all night, but figured that he&#39;d get Mark back for it later somehow... besides, he still had the goal of finding out what kind of guy Angela loved.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Janet walked back inside, letting Stephi and Brutus share their special round two. Part of her felt bad for leaving Steve like that, but the other part of her didn&#39;t care at all. He had a choice and he chose the dog over her. Besides, George was too much of a hunk to let go on being single. Janet already had an amazing night with him before, and couldn&#39;t wait for her own round two.<br />
<br />
As she walked inside, she placed garden gloves on the table and started to wash her hands. She wondered why dinner wasn&#39;t on the table yet. She figured George would&#39;ve started by now, and if not George then definitely Alana would have. Alana was Janet&#39;s precious little future home maker, so she would&#39;ve have prepared it unless something was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mom.&quot; Janet suddenly heard Alana from behind. <br />
<br />
She turned and was surprised to see how Alana was dressed. She was wearing pink Hello Kitty pajama pants and a white tank top with obviously no support underneath. Her wavy blonde hair was tied up in a terrible bun and she looked like she had no makeup on.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on honey?&quot; Janet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, didn&#39;t dad tell you before he left for the game with Mark?&quot; Alana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;George and Mark went where?&quot; She asked annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, the baseball game?&quot; She responded, confused that she didn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they did.&quot; Janet sighed. Janet remembered Steve loved taking Mark to games with him, so of course George would too. &quot;And what about you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I asked Dad, and he said I could have... friends with to sleep over.&quot; She said with an awkward smile. Alan wasn&#39;t used to his female charms, so tried his best to not upset his mother, although it wasn&#39;t working all too well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn&#39;t ask me?&quot; Janet said upset. &quot;ugh, honey I&#39;m not exactly in the mood to supply for a bunch of 15 year old girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry.&quot; Alana replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what.&quot; Janet said with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s totally fine.&quot; She laughed and walked off.<br />
<br />
Alan was worried, but decided to to pry too deeply. As long as he and Angela got a long chat about boy&#39;s then he&#39;d be set. After that, when he was a guy again, he could take all the time in the world to sweep her off her feet.<br />
<br />
Janet was pissed. Not only did George leave her to watch over a sleepover, but she would&#39;t even get an inch of George&#39;s amazing dick to make up for it all! So, she decided, if she couldn&#39;t get some action tonight, then she&#39;d have fun with her daughter. She walked up and picked the book up, moving through to pick the specific spells which she wanted. She decided to swap her age, her name, and her life role with Angela, her daughter&#39;s best friend <br />
<br />
In an instant, Janet found herself sitting in the back seat of a minivan. The front door to it opened up and in stepped Janet&#39;s friend Debra, Angela&#39;s mother... or, rather, her mother now.<br />
&quot;You ready to go Janet, have everything dear?&quot; Debra asked Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, thanks Mom!&quot; Janet smiled. This would be the perfect crime. She&#39;d have fun gossiping and being young again, she&#39;d embarrass her daughter a little without her knowledge, and then just change back the next morning before she needs to leave.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alan was nervous. What would he even say to her? Alan wasn&#39;t used to being a girl he was a guy! He needed to impress Janet, but also not be weird. &quot;No, no focus. Just at some point ask Janet about guys and then just survive the night, that&#39;s all you need to do.&quot; He reassured himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?&quot; His mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah mom?&quot; Alan responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Alana, I ordered pizza for you and your friends.&quot; Angela told her daughter. &quot;It&#39;ll be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mom, you&#39;re the best.&quot; Alan sighed, giving his mother a hug. He wondered why he was so nervous around women. At least he could hug his mother.<br />
<br />
As Angela gave her daughter a hug, she felt a little better about having to watch over the slumber party. Alana was adorable anyway, and Angela couldn&#39;t help but not stay mat at her. Alana&#39;s gorgeous red hair that she got from her mother, her adorable freckles, she just screamed sweetheart.<br />
<br />
Angela walked away and wondered about how George and Mark were doing. &quot;Would Steve have left me to go to the game?&quot; She wondered as she gazed at Brutus and Stephi lounging under a tree. &quot;Yes, he probably would&#39;ve... but, that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t get out of this.&quot; She thought before running over to the book.<br />
<br />
In a flash of light, she found herself outside, covered in hair. She looked next to her to see Stephi the poodle sleeping soundly. Angela felt her new member start to get aroused. She couldn&#39;t wait for Steve to wake up so she could simultaneously have fun and teach him more of a lesson.<br />
<br />
Inside, Betty was annoyed. She didn&#39;t want to have to watch over Alana and her friends. She stared out at the dogs in the yard. Stephi used to be Steve, but she wondered how it would be to be like Angie, the Irish Terrier. &quot;Oh well, I&#39;m a human not a dog, I have to deal with my problems properly.&quot; She thought, responsibly.<br />
<br />
DING DONG.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akk, she&#39;s here!&quot; Alan thought, panicked. He made sure his rough brown hair looked nice and that his shirt was good. &quot;What am I doing? Janet isn&#39;t into girls... at least I hope not.&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
The door opened and in walked the now 15 year old Janet, staring at her former daughter Alana. Janet looked over and smirked at the now older Betty, who she remembered being a 15 year old daughter of Debra a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, hey Janet.&quot; Alan said awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girlfriend!&quot; Janet laughed, giving Alana a hug. &quot;The other&#39;s will be here soon, but let&#39;s go talk just you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay!&quot; Alan agreed, following his crush upstairs.<br />
<br />
Betty sighed, sitting down at the table with the book propped up nearby. &quot;Sigh, I wish I could be young and hip again.&quot; She laughed, when the book began to glow slightly. Curious, she opened it up and hear a message in her head. &quot;Multiple complex unaware changes have been used, use this spell to resolve.&quot; It read as a new spell appeared called &quot;resolve&quot; which betty found odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s strange, I haven&#39;t made any changes tonight?&quot; Betty wondered.<br />
<br />
What does she do.</p>
