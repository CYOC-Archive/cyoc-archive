<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William and Martha glanced to each other as Eric said, &quot;but we need to talk.&quot; It was sudden and said in a way that neither Anderson parent suspected, though Martha had some sense that Eric had questions over her liaison with Kat. William&#39;s affairs in Minnesota hadn&#39;t just hurt her, but had hurt Eric and Nate as well in that they had their father outed as someone &quot;not entirely honorable&quot; and were embarrassed by it as well. Both Nate and Eric had had to see and go through the strain related to the legal hearings and fully understand why they were moving from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Moon Lake, Washington State. It was likely that neither Eric nor Nate wanted what had happened in Minnesota to happen again, for fear of their family breaking up.<br />
<br />
Yet, Martha&#39;s bringing Kat home had the potential have that reaction. Eric had always been a smart kid and wasn&#39;t going to miss that Martha had brought home someone she had no other reason to. However, at present, Martha&#39;s fun with Kat wasn&#39;t like what happened in Minnesota. In Minnesota, William had strayed on his own, for whatever reason and didn&#39;t have permission. He may have looked for some time with Martha first and at times she had turned him down over her own issues of repressing being bisexual, but that still didn&#39;t mean that William had had permission to find someone else. The present situation was very different. Martha had embraced being bisexual and became a werecat, and when William felt his bond as a married werefox fully form, much of the hurt and pain between the two of them that had gone on in Minnesota had gone away. In that, the two of them had moved toward a more open marriage, to let Martha enjoy the full extent of her sexuality and she had even offered to share lovers with William if they were willing, as she felt she could trust William&#39;s bond to her and since she&#39;d become a werecat, she&#39;d felt her own libido rise to the point where it really wasn&#39;t taking much to get Martha&#39;s interest in a little &quot;adult fun.&quot; Right now, they just had to explain all that to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we can talk,&quot; Martha said, &quot;come on in, we can talk in the living room before you go to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
William then lead Eric into the living room while Martha shut the door. She then joined her husband and son on the couch, folding her tail so that way she wasn&#39;t sitting on it or pushing it against the back of the couch. Eric sat comfortably between his parents, but his face looked rather serious and concerned as he glanced between William and Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I take it you&#39;d wish to discuss about Kat?&quot; Martha asked to her youngest son after a moment or two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie noticed Kat eyeing you, mom,&quot; Eric stated, &quot;and how many substitute teachers or substitute aids bring regular staff home to have sex with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not many,&quot; Martha admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think there was ever something like that in Minnesota when I taught... Though, Moon Lake could be different for a few obvious reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded as he noted his mother&#39;s brown furred body as well as the red-orange fur on his father&#39;s arms that went down to his forearms, which had black fur and looked sort of like his father was wearing gloves. Both his parents were weres, as he was, and both his parents could be more easily aroused than normals. He thought he could detect some scent of arousal on his father and he had to admit that some of his thoughts on Julie quickly turned into various fantasies that involved both of them being naked. That was clearly a difference from other parts of the country where the were population was likely much lower than it was in Moon Lake, if non-existent.<br />
<br />
However, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that it was okay for his mom to just decide start picking up lovers just because she was a werecat. It&#39;d be a repeat of the things that had forced the Anderson family to leave Minnesota in the first place. Some of it might simply be that his mother was testing the proverbial waters regarding the fact that she was bi, which Julie suggested, but Eric felt that would need to be confirmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why?&quot; Eric asked, &quot;I mean... it looks a lot like what made us move here... just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With your mother playing my role?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it may look that way on the outside, but it isn&#39;t,&quot; William said slowly, &quot;and perhaps your mother and I should have told you before now... but this isn&#39;t necessarily easy and it never came up until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked between both his parents, now feeling rather puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; Martha assured him, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that Will and I weren&#39;t exactly in the best of places when we came to Moon Lake... Still loving, but getting over all the revelations and consequences about what happened in Minnesota...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But THAT is all behind us,&quot; William smiled to Martha as he happily bounced his fluffy tail up and down on the couch beside him, &quot;My bond to your mother is strong and firm. I will do anything to keep that bond strong and keep your mother happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t explain mom bringing the teacher she&#39;s working with as a sub to have sex with her,&quot; Eric pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alone it doesn&#39;t,&quot; William nodded, &quot;but my bond isn&#39;t the only factor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded placed a hand on Eric&#39;s shoulder. She gave a low purr to assure him that things were fine and there was no trouble as she added to what her husband had said. Eric only traded glances between both his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another factor is my sexuality,&quot; Martha said softly to Eric, &quot;I&#39;ve probably always been bisexual... but I wasn&#39;t raised to think that way. Your grandparents... my parents and my elder sister were all very straight and very firm in the belief that homosexuality or bisexuality or transgender issues were all odd and wrong. They aren&#39;t the type to advocate stoning people, like they did in the Bible... but neither are they the sort of people that would even talk to people like the Twists, even if it was on a &quot;professional&quot; need to do so. As a result... I began repressing that I was bi... whenever I saw a woman that I thought was pretty or desirable... I shook it off and tried to tell myself that I was straight and wasn&#39;t into women.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha paused to look up to William. She looked into his presently vulpine eyes and could see the warm smile he gave for her with his muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately I did meet your father and we did fall in love and we still love each other deeply,&quot; Martha continued, &quot;but... I was still repressing who I was... repressing that I was bisexual and that put a lot of stress on me. Stress that probably had its own consequences, particularly because after a time, I&#39;d actually stopped realizing that I was repressing that I was bi. It just sorta kept happening. Even before...&quot; Martha&#39;s voice immediately went icy in its tone, &quot;Yvette decided to claw your father... I&#39;d begun having a few dreams of myself with the Twists... either in human form or as I am now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those dreams made you realize that you were repressing being bi?&quot; Eric asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Martha shook her head, &quot;the fact that they occurred fairly frequently may have helped me realize that I am bisexual, but the thing that helped me realize it was how comfortable Samantha and Frances are together. They look and move comfortably together and were very friendly with me. It countered everything that my parents and big sister thought of with regard to sexuality and made me realize that if the way I was raised was wrong, then maybe it wasn&#39;t so bad to be bi. When that happened... the face of just about every woman that I&#39;d ever seen growing up and up to now that I&#39;d ever seen and found attractive flashed before my eyes. In this... something just clicked and I knew that I was bi and that I&#39;d been repressing it. Now, this all occurred around the same time that your father was clawed when I realized what I&#39;d been doing to myself... which is why I went with the Twists and became a werecat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric watched as Martha gestured to her triangular ears, rounded muzzle, and then finished by holding out one paw-like hand and flexing her retractable claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in doing so... I feel complete,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;I&#39;m perfectly fine with being bi... there are aspects of it that are quite pleasurable and wonderful. Men have a certain hardness that is very appealing while women have a certain softness that is equally appealing, just in a different way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how does that relate to you bringing the teacher you were working with home to have sex with?&quot; Eric asked to his mother and then turned over to his father, &quot;and how is this different from what happened in Minnesota?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It explains on how our relationship has changed and advanced after becoming weres,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;We still love each other deeply. That hasn&#39;t changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my bond has only strengthened the love that was always there,&quot; William added, &quot;but with it came a recognition on the issues that Martha had been wrestling with that didn&#39;t relate to me. I didn&#39;t know your mother was bisexual until we moved here. Learning that Martha was bi was a surprise, but it isn&#39;t like I could demand that she only have sex with me... It&#39;d be hypocritical on my part and would only make me come off as not understanding Martha being bi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric blinked and began to connect the proverbial dots in his father&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... you knew and are okay with it?&quot; Eric answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it lets your mother feel complete as a person being that she is bi, yes, I&#39;m okay with it,&quot; William nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I means our marriage is going to be more open than it was,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;letting me feel complete...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so long as your mother is happy, I&#39;m happy and my bond feels stronger,&quot; William added and to his wife&#39;s green feline eyes, &quot;and so long as we remain together, that is all that matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And again... we should have told you that our marriage is becoming a more open one,&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;but we didn&#39;t have a full idea on how to manage it and often the issue hadn&#39;t come up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you aren&#39;t splitting up?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never,&quot; both parents said together, &quot;we&#39;re happy together and will grow old together. It may be different from how things were when we got married... but then... we&#39;re different from how we were then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric found himself chuckling as his parents again made reference to the fact that they were weres now. Their answer explained things, and in a way sounded like Julie&#39;s later theory that his mom was relishing being a werecat and having some girl/girl fun as she got used to being a were, though not exactly. While parts of it seemed a bit odd, he had to admit that the fear that old problems were coming back was unfounded. He wasn&#39;t quite sure on what to say on the issue, but figured that so long as his parents were happy and his family stayed together, things would be okay.</p>
