<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Were-weddings are not your typical weddings. There is no bride walking down the aisle; a minister droning on with a group of onlookers doing their best to resist the urge to cry. No group of bridesmaids and best man as well. A were-wedding is an intimate affair between two lovers, regardless of their gender or sexual preference. More akin to an engagement proposal; one provides the ring or any item symbolizing their undying love for the other. The words spoken unique to each couple as the gift is presented. Yet the end result is always the same; a wild passionate expression of love that lasts for any length of time. Imperceptible to the couple, but noticeable to other were’s; a lingering yet permanent scent of each other’s mate hangs on the other. No amount of showering or bathing can ever remove said scent.<br />
<br />
To Mother Nature; the couple are mates, bonded and in love. Yet in the eyes of most nation&#39;s laws, the couple is considered in a common law relationship. While a piece of paper signifying the two married is insignificant towards each other; they still have a wedding ceremony for the benefit of family and friends.<br />
<br />
That is what Nate Anderson is currently experiencing. After feeling the urge to propose to Jean Talbot, with an onion ring no less; Regina could sense that a were-wedding was upon them and felt it was best to have Nate use a family heirloom to help make such a unique event more significant. A simple gold band with an amber stone now sits on Jean’s furry finger. After their initial bout of passion celebrating Nate’s proposal; both Nate and Jean had another moment, where Nate mounted his were-lioness Mate and expressed his dominance like any male werewolf tends to do when rutting. Coming off their second round of orgasmic bliss, with Jean collapsing on her bed with Nate still on top and knotted in her; purring as the feeling of Nate spilling his seed in her makes her feel complete.<br />
“We are going to have to take a pause,” Jean blissfully sighing; “I need to take my were-birth control pill soon. I want your offspring Nate,” Jean smiling; “just not yet.”<br />
“So we are engaged now,” Nate still enjoying his afterglow; “and I was all set to propose with an onion ring. Your mother giving me the ring your father gave her,” Nate shifting so he can embrace his mate better; “was a surprise.”<br />
“It’s a Talbot tradition to use that ring,” Jean purring as she enjoys being enveloped by Nate; “you could of bent a paper clip into a ring and it would of worked for me. But seeing you give me mother&#39;s engagement ring,” Jean smiling; “that made this moment magical, husband.”<br />
“Husband,” Nate looking stunned; “since when did we get married?”<br />
“The moment we mated after your proposal,” Jean chuckling; “I take it you never heard of a were-wedding then.”<br />
<br />
It took Jean some explaining to Nate who wasn’t a naturally born were what a were-wedding is and its significance. Mostly observed by the were-lion pride, a few of the were-cat and were-feline prides as well as the were-foxes; Nate found out that were-weddings was mostly a consummation of each others love for the other. Finding out that other were&#39;s will detect his mate’s scent permanently lingering on him as well as his on Jean was a pleasant surprise.<br />
“Lastly,” Jean feeling Nate’s knot deflate enough to allow him to pull out; “were-weddings also generally result in a pregnancy between man and woman. But since you are seventeen and still in high school,” Jean sitting up on her bed kissing Nate; “that would a bit of an issue.”<br />
“Oh fuck,” Nate nearly shouting; “my parents are going to flip when they find out.”<br />
“Well,” Jean rolling her eyes; “they will need to have what I just told you explained to them, but they’ll understand. Your parents are were-foxes with a bond between them right?”<br />
“Yes,” Nate answering; “what of it?”<br />
“Were-weddings are common with them,” Jean smiling; “the bond they form with their mate is just more pronounced. Now I don’t know about you,” Jean taking a were-birth control pill and getting up; “but I want some of my mom’s chicken ala king.”<br />
<br />
Nate soon found out that the Talbot’s version of chicken ala king was similar to chicken parmesan. Its call chicken ala king, because Leon the were-lion king enjoyed serving and dishing it from the tray Regina cooked it in. Nate laughing at the play on words as Jean explained it to him. Both sitting at the table, each in their fursonas and running their paws up and down each other’s thighs; it took a cough from Leon who also shifted into his fursona.<br />
“You two can have all the fun in playing with each other,” Leon smiling; “but not at the dinner table.”<br />
“Where is Peter,” Jean noticing her older brother absent.<br />
“He left as soon as you two began your were-wedding,” Regina smiling; “I doubt he’ll be back for the night.”<br />
“Peter mentioned seeing if Liv was home,” Leon chuckling as he dished out dinner; “so we’ll save him a bit of your mother’s cooking.”<br />
<br />
Dinner was pleasant. Among the topics was Nate’s thriving landscape business; a business formed from a joking remark made by Alex last winter; Nate now does more than just mow lawns. He helps design build and plant gardens; laying sod, trimming hedges and the odd tree now and then. But it was the next line of questions that made Nate a little nervous.<br />
“So when do we get to meet your parents,” Leon looking at the werewolf.<br />
I thought you already met them,” Nate scrambling for an answer; “at the New Year’s party up the Knight Estate.”<br />
“They were the were-fox couple that could not keep their paws off each other,” Jean smiling; “despite their attempts to mingle.”<br />
“They forgot that were’s don’t mix well with liquor,” Nate looking embarrassed; “mom and dad thought they could pack away the champagne like they did before moving to Moon Lake.”<br />
“I think I remember seeing a pair of red furred were-foxes passed out in each other’s paws on the stairs,” Leon looking thoughtful.<br />
“That was them,” Nate sighing; “I think they spent the night there.<br />
“We ended up passing out in the drawing room if I remember correctly,” Jean looking at Nate.<br />
“Well the Knights do throw the biggest parties,” Regina speaking; “New Years is always the biggest bash. Glad I don’t have to clean up afterwards,” Regina chuckling.<br />
<br />
“But still,” Leon looking at Nate; “how soon can we meet your parents?”<br />
“Saturday afternoon,” Nate thinking; “they are heading to the were-club tonight. Holding court with the swinger’s circuit I think. I’ll text them that you want to meet if you’d like.”<br />
“That will do,” Leon grinning; “we need to talk regarding the wedding ceremony you and my daughter will have.” Nate chokes on his chicken upon hearing those two words as Leon laughs and continues; “you and Jean may be wedded through mating; but you do need to make it official.”<br />
“Dad,” Jean speaking up; “you’re not planning on making this a big to do at the next pride gathering are you? Because that is way too soon for the both of us,” Jean growling; “I don’t care if its next week, you are not officiating the wedding.”<br />
“Your father is a priest,” Nate looking at Jean questioningly.<br />
“No,” Lean laughing; “I’m just ordained to hold civil ceremonies. But these matters do need to be discussed with your parents Nate,” Leon speaking; “I’m sure they also need to be told the significance of a were-wedding.”<br />
“Now if you too are done eating,” Regina smiling; “stay for some dessert? Or do you have your own dessert planned?”</p>
