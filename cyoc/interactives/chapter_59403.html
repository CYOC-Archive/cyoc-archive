<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fridge door shut and everything went dark.<br />
<br />
Jeremy examined himself from inside the glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so awesome!&quot; he thought.  &quot;He did it.  He really did turn me into a glass of water!&quot;  The feeling was extremely unusual.  He retained consciousness and, it seemed, most of his five senses, but he had no shape.  He was naked, certainly, and he felt his body was packed in on all sides, held together by the round glass that was keeping him from spilling everywhere.<br />
<br />
Jeremy tried to reach up and pull himself to the top of the glass.  But it was no use.  Having no muscular system, no means of movement, just a bunch of water molecules, all Jeremy could do was remain in the glass, conforming to its shape and thinking to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a dream come true,&quot; thought the Jeremy water.  &quot;I'm completely helpless.  What I need is for someone to drink me, a body to become a part of.&quot;  Jeremy felt himself becoming aroused--as aroused as a glass of water CAN be--as he imagined which of his friends Ty might allow him to be consumed by.  Whoever it was would be Jeremy's new home.  <br />
<br />
He was glad Ty had wished that Jeremy could keep his molecules intact so he wouldn't have to worry about being completely dissipated or pissed out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;But if I ever WANTED to get out...&quot; thought Jeremy.  &quot;How would I...?  I guess I couldn't, really.&quot;  Jeremy thought about all possible escape routes.  Being urinated out would get him flushed, and allowing himself to be sweated out would mean he'd likely lose a lot of himself in the process.  There was no getting around it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever drinks me...I'll be inside him forever and ever, trapped inside his body.&quot;  Jeremy smiled.  For years he had been secretly addicted to imagining situations like this--of being consumed, controlled by his friends--but never dreamed that such a fantasy could ACTUALLY come true.  <br />
<br />
Jeremy lost himself in thought.  Then Jeremy remembered his enormous muscles.  Would Jeremy's hulking size and brute strength somehow be absorbed as well?  Jeremy decided he would do his absolute best to enhance the life of his new master, whoever he was.<br />
<br />
Jeremy didn't know how long he'd been sitting there, thinking to himself.  The passage of time to a glass of water... was it different than for humans?<br />
<br />
Jeremy heard footsteps approaching the fridge.<br />
<br />
The door opened and the fridge light clicked on.  It was Dustin, Ty's brother.  Or, at least, Jeremy THOUGHT it was Dustin.  The kid looked he couldn't be any older than 12 or 13.  &quot;Must be the distortion from the glass,&quot; he thought.  &quot;But where's Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked disdainfully at the glass of water, sighed, then reached down.<br />
<br />
&quot;OHMYGOSH!&quot; thought Jeremy.  &quot;This is it!  This is it!  I wouldn't have picked Dustin but...Oh man!  He's picking me up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy could see and feel an enormous mitt of a warm hand--small for the recently de-aged Dustin but huge to a glass of water like Jeremy--close itself around the glass.  Then, everything rocked and shifted as Jeremy was lifted up.  Jeremy's water-body shook and splashed a bit from the movement.  The feeling was amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Dustin is going to drink me.  In a second, I'll be part of his body!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin raised the glass.<br />
<br />
Jeremy braced himself.<br />
<br />
Then Jeremy felt himself falling.  His vision became distorted as he felt his body being pulled apart by gravity.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the--&quot;<br />
<br />
SPLOSH--Jeremy's watery body slapped against the hard metal of the kitchen sink.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened...?&quot; Jeremy thought.  His head was swimming.  The whole world was a distorted mess.  &quot;I must've let myself come apart...I can't see but I... I've got to try and focus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking from a hundred different eyes--his body had splashed into pieces--Jeremy suddenly became aware of where he was.  And what was about to happen to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm in the sink.  I'm not being drunk.  I'm supposed to be drunk!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze,&quot; said Dustin.  &quot;Why does Ty always leave his dirty dishes lying around?  I'd get in trouble if I did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy followed the movement of Dustin's hand as it reached out for the spigot.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  NO!  NOOOO!&quot; thought Jeremy.  &quot;TY!  WHERE ARE YOU?!  HELP!&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was too late.<br />
<br />
Dustin had turned the spigot and water came gushing out of the faucet.  It slammed into Jeremy's body.  Jeremy, forgetting to hold himself together, found his body and consciousness being diluted with the introduction of more H2O.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This can't be happening!  Dustin!  Can you hear me!  It's Jeremy!  TURN OFF THE SINK!!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Then the movement started.  <br />
<br />
Jeremy felt his body being pulled away.  He looked over at the black, gaping hole he was quickly moving toward.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No!  I'm going down the drain!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a moment, Jeremy was sliding, face first, uncontrollably down the drain.  <br />
<br />
And in another moment, Jeremy's entire body was completely gone.<br />
<br />
The drain gurgled.<br />
<br />
Dustin left the sink running for a few seconds, having been distracted by his hunt for something to eat.  Finding nothing that looked good, he went to the sink, rinsed the rim of the glass a bit--he didn't want Ty's germs--then filled it with perfectly ordinary tap water and gulped it down.  He rinsed the glass again, dried it, then put it in the cupboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's never anything good to eat in here,&quot; he said as he left the kitchen, flicking the light switch behind him.</p>
