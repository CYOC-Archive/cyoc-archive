<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spencer raced through the forest, following Jeremy Bower’s scent as best she could. Anger was clouded her mind. Just like her father, the only thing she could think about was tearing Jeremy to pieces for what he did to her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Samson having finally gotten through to the police station, a werewolf tries to follow Spencer. But her unique scent makes things a bit difficult. Werewolf mixed with werepanther, he’s not sure if he’s following her or another were.<br />
<br />
“Officer Connor?” The werewolf’s radio beeps on his shoulder. Though he is transformed, he still has some of his equipment strapped to his body. He stops running, and answering the call. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir?”<br />
<br />
“Have you found her?”<br />
<br />
“I’m on her trail. What about the suspect? Have you found him?”<br />
<br />
“No. We suspect he knows by now, that we’re onto him. He’s a weredog, a Rottweiler. We only just got the information.” the officer on the other end said.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, I’ll keep an eye out if I see him.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, but remember your priority is bringing that girl home before she gets hurt, or worse.” The other officer hangs up, leaving Officer Ryan Conner to go back to his hunt for Spencer Lawson. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the officer, Spencer’s father is a SEAL. She knows how to disappear, and cover her tracks. Spencer makes sure not to brush up against anything while she runs. She leaps into the lake, and then shakes her scent all over a bush, in the opposite direction she wants to go in. <br />
<br />
“I’m ending this. Jeremy’s my problem. I’m not letting him ruin my life again.” She thought angrily. Spencer tears off and past the Stovall’s backyard. Some part of her brain registers the fishy smell, but ignore it to focus on the scent she’s tracking. Jeremy’s scent grows stronger as she gets closer and closer to town. <br />
<br />
Spencer stops running to think. She can’t change back, she doesn’t have any clothes to wear. But at the same time, she can’t go running around town in her were form, not without getting arrested or drawing attention to herself. Frustrated, Spencer runs a few feet further into the first, to conceal herself as best she can given the bright colored trees around her, and her own dark fur. <br />
<br />
She stops at another stream, and washed her fur off to throw her scent away. She stares at her reflection. Her eyes are crazed, glowing like mad. Her pupils, normally large and circular, have narrowed into catlike slits. And her irises have gone from a deep green to a bright gold. Like her mother’s eyes do when she gets angry in her were form. The hair on her tail stands on end, fluffed up and letting all who see her know she’s agitated. <br />
<br />
Spencer paces in small circles, contemplating her next move. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in Moon Lake, Jeremy has realized the cops are onto him. A large number of police cars rush down the street in various directions. So Jeremy sheds his clothing, and runs into the forest in his were form for cover. That’s when he catches a fresh scent. Spencer’s…<br />
<br />
Excitement filled his head as he followed her sweet scent. He follows her scent through the woods, and eventually comes to the conclusion that she’s follow his scent. <br />
<br />
“She’s seeking me out.”Jeremy thought proudly. His mate would come to him in due time. All he had to do was wait. He’d come this far, and now Spencer would come to him. Jeremy lay back against a tree, pleasant thoughts running through his mind of what would happen after he and Spencer were reunited. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Back tracking a bit……<br />
<br />
“WHAT!?” Evan Lawson lost all control when Officer Carter told him what had just happened outside. Jonathan and Maggie couldn’t stop him now. Evan ignored the others’ protests, and tore out the backdoor to find his daughter, and then Bower. His clothes joined Spencer’s on the forest floor, as his fursona ripped them apart. <br />
<br />
His own dark gray fur waved in the wind, and his black tipped ears flattened against his head as his anger grew. He didn’t know what Spencer was thinking, going after Bower by herself. As if his concerns weren’t bad enough, Evan’s mind kept replaying this awful image of his daughter in a worse state than that faithful night he and Maggie came home only to find Spencer in tears, beaten and hurting (internal and external). <br />
<br />
Those memories caused Evan to run faster. He was already on his daughter’s scent, and his legs pumped faster. Then he caught Bower’s scent, and he all by roared with anger and frustration. <br />
<br />
“That sick bastard isn’t getting away again.” Evan thought in his rage. <br />
<br />
Back at the house, Maggie was fighting the urge to go after Evan. She sat down, and put her head in her hands. Her sister tried to console her, but nothing she said or did could alleviate Maggie’s growing worries.  <br />
<br />
“What should we do now?” Samantha asked. <br />
<br />
“I’ve already altered the station that Spencer’s out there. Guess I’ll have to add Evan to the list. You all should go home and just relax. There’s nothing else to do until someone either spots Bower, or he reveals himself.” Samson sighed, this case getting more and more complicated. <br />
<br />
“I’ll go upstairs and get the boys. Lord knows what’s going on up there. I’m sure they’ve noticed Spencer’s gone by now.” William said. He dashed up the stairs, while Elle tried to comfort her sister. Her words weren’t reaching Maggie’s ears. Her own mind was running with horrible images. Spencer or Evan (or God forbid) both of them injured or rose… <br />
<br />
Maggie started to shake with nervousness, and silent tears dripped down to the floor. Elle hugs her sister, and looks at Jonathan. He mirrors the concerned look, and offers a hand. Elle takes it in hers. Samantha and Samson, along with Martha, slip out of the kitchen to give the family some privacy. William returns with Alex and Eric, the latter of whom looks as confused as one can be. <br />
<br />
“I should have stopped her. I saw her go.” Alex was kicking himself for not doing something when he saw Spencer in the hallway. He hadn’t been able to hear much, but what he had heard of the conversation downstairs wasn’t good. And Spencer heard everything. <br />
<br />
“It’s not your fault. I don’t think anyone could have stopped her. She’s quite like her father I gather.” Samson said. Samantha nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
“Go back to our place, Ben and Francis are there. There’s no point in worrying yourself. I’m sure your parents will be wanting to leave soon for your relatives.” Samantha reminded Alex. But he couldn’t think of that now. He was worried about Spencer. The two weren’t especially close, but he could see how much she meant to the younger Anderson. Who had remained completely silent. <br />
<br />
“God, what must be going through Eric’s head.” Alex thought.</p>
