<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A naked T-rex lizard woman was sitting on somewhat-too-small for her size clinical table in a typical medical room. Around her a few technicians in quarantine suits were interacting with instruments and her, including her fulfilling the requests they had and giving back feedback in the best ways she could without a way to talk. Although her saurian head made it a little harder to tell, one could easily see this lizard seemed to be bored, if cooperative. She wasn&#39;t completely naked, wearing a somewhat small lanyard around her neck, showing to ID of a 20 something year old man named &quot;Ronald&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ronald is a volunteer in an overall effort for the military to manpower back out into the world. There was various reasons for this, but both the combat ability and hardiness of being a lizard person and being a helpful sentient at that was at the top of the list. It was discussed holding back on the idea, especially since little testing and observation has been done with those who used the antidote and changed, but things were not getting better for humanity just holding out and everyone agreed something needed to be done.<br />
<br />
So why was Ronald a Lizard WOMAN? The answer was simple: The lizardmen just had too many size-related issues while most of the lizardwomen could still operate vehicles, computers, weapons, and other equipment. Then there was just being able to go inside many indoor areas, or being in places that could support a lizardman&#39;s weight. The majority of volunteers would still be lizardmen, but it was obvious the reasons why the women would be needed as well. As for why Ronald was selected: he was one of the more accurate soldiers with a gun and decent fluency with computers.<br />
<br />
The techs were soon done with their duties. It was just the equivalent of a last-minute check up to see if there was anything wrong or odd with Ronald. Psychologically he was fine. Biologically... well it was long-accepted being very horny, having milk-filled tits, and a perpetually wet lizard vagina were common characteristics, but there were many reports and even lizardpeople at Delta Lab that could have more unique biologies. Ronald hoped no surprises would pop up for him that they haven&#39;t already found. With a go-ahead, Ronald went back to his living quarters.<br />
<br />
The &quot;living quarters&quot; was more like a small jail cell to observe test subjects from, but it suited Ronald just fine for a converted living space including a make-shift shower. On one of the walls was a mirror, and Ronald decided to take in the form again that he now wore for less than a day, and this time at his own pacing.<br />
<br />
Ronald saw himself, or herself as a T-rex Lizardwoman, with green-tan color mix for her scaley skin, the largest of lizardwomen she was aware of, and a nice hourglass figure with massive tits to match her size. Overall she still didn&#39;t compare to the Lizardmen in terms of raw power and size, and luckily she could still use equipment and fit where it mattered. <br />
<br />
What was still getting her was her T-rex head. It was hers, in full control, but it was lacking in many ways compared to a human&#39;s in terms of displaying expression and body language. Her eyes were more to the side, although there was a difference in depth perception, wider sight range, and light-adjustment, it didn&#39;t affect her too much, especially with using a gun. She had the characteristic overbite of a T-rex, complete with vicious looking fangs, but she grew use to handling her mouth and eating food, and never managing to hurt herself. Speaking of using her mouth, she went to practice body language as suggested by the techs and other transformed.<br />
<br />
An attempt at a smile didn&#39;t do much. It showed off her brutal teeth more and a very alien look with widened eyes. She couldn&#39;t really pull off an &quot;angry&quot; look at all. After more facial attempts at expressions, the best she could do was use her eyelids for some expression since regular lizards didn&#39;t really use them for much more than blinking. Talking was out of the question, as she could only growl in a T-rex way and even than haven&#39;t figured how which attempt at speech lead to what. She had the rest of her body though...<br />
<br />
Ronald could do alot more with her body. Body builder flexing, giving a thumbs up, and even practicing some poses from fashion models showed that not only she could express herself in that manner, but it was also obvious she was sapient. And to prove it, she even groped her beachball sized breasts just because she could.<br />
<br />
The act gave her a major reminder of the other aspects of her body, and she felt a dampness increase in her cloaca. The beachball tits didn&#39;t particularly seem to weigh her down or get in the way, even with the milk sloshing around. However, her body was sensitive and she at the very least felt a slight buzz of horniness at all times. The only advice by others was the horniness could be kept in check was by liberal masturbation and part of the reason why the lizards at Delta Lab were usually naked. There was the option of full on sex with a partner, but it was currently discouraged until they knew more about lizardpeople reproduction. Time to feel herself up.<br />
<br />
The sight over touching, groping, and full-on manhandling herself in the mirror was exotic but to the point. Her moans came out as growls. She was leaking profusely from her cloaca. She even had some fun playing with her boobs and controlling how much milk was coming out. She was making a mess with all the liquids coming out of her, but that was part of the reason for the shower. Over the course of the masturbation session, she had several orgasms, and fulfilling ones at that. She wasn&#39;t sure if she would ever have regular sex ever again, but having an easy way to get-off was something she could appreciate.<br />
<br />
After and finishing and cleaning up, Ronald the T-rex woman finally went to rest, with her boobs splayed across her own torso and taking care to not play with her cloaca, at least not while she was conscious...</p>
