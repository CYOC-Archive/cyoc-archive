<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Missy opened the door to her house and walked in her twins, Sarah and Thomas were now one year old and her newborn baby Bobby had been born two days ago. Missy had obviously wished away all of her weight she had gained from pregnancy amongst other things and she again had her body that so many men had lusted over even whilst she was pregnant.<br />
<br />
Her neighbour was coming over later with her two children. She was having Missy take care of them for a few days whilst she was away on a business trip. Her two children were both very well behaved, so Missy was sure she could manage and even if she couldn&#39;t she always had the ring. Her neighbour&#39;s two children were aged 4 and 16, Missy was sure that James the 16 year old was old enough to take care of himself but apparently her neighbour didn&#39;t want any parties, Missy was sure she could take care of Abby the four year old, she was well behaved, although neither child had met her before and that bothered her slightly. <br />
Missy was feeding Bobby when her doorbell rang, she put Bobby to bed and went to open the door. Waiting for her was her neighbour Jade, her daughter Abby and her son James. Jade was In her early thirties with almost no curves and a very plain face. Abby was similar she was very plain, quite short and skinny. James however was definitely on his father&#39;s side, he was tall, muscular and rather handsome. Missy was actually becoming quite turned on by him. He obviously felt the same way as from the second Missy opened the door he was trying to suppress his throbbing erection with his hands.<br />
Abby tugged on her mother&#39;s leg.<br />
&quot;Mommy, why has that girl got watermelons in her shirt?&quot;<br />
&quot;Abby, that was very rude,&quot; said Jade &quot;oh they say the darndest things don&#39;t they. Thanks for doing this by the way I couldn&#39;t find anyone else to do it.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine really, do you want to come in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh no, I have to go, well I&#39;ll see you in three days then. You two be good.&quot; Jade walked down the driveway and into her car leaving Missy to take care of Abby and James.<br />
&quot;Hey guys, um I&#39;m Miss Pueringer but you can call me Missy ok.&quot; Missy said, Abby nodded and ran into the kitchen leaving Missy with James. &quot;You must be James, I can show you your room in a minute, do you want anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m okay actually, I&#39;ll just dump my stuff and be out of your hair all day, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d prefer that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t mister, I&#39;ve made big plans for this weekend and we&#39;re all going through with it okay.&quot; Missy made a point to bend over to show James as much of her breasts as she could.<br />
&quot;Well okay then if you insist.&quot;<br />
Missy called Abby back in and told both her and James that there would be punishments if they misbehaved. They both understood even though James looked slightly annoyed. Missy showed them both their rooms, Abby was sharing with Sarah and James had the guest bedroom. They both unpacked their stuff and came downstairs for dinner. <br />
After dinner Abby was told to go to bed, she did so. Leaving Missy alone with James. Missy cleared up and asked James what he wanted to do, they decided on just talking.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I seem forward but how old are you?&quot; Asked James. Missy wasn&#39;t offended with her figure she was often asked about her age and other things.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 26 James&quot; why do you ask.<br />
&quot;Just curious I suppose, I assumed you weren&#39;t young what with your...&quot; he motioned an hourglass with his hands, Missy knew what he meant but just wanted him to say it.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay James say what you want&quot; she said comfortingly.<br />
&quot;... Body&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Oh, well I guess I was always big for my age I guess. And ever since I had my children I&#39;ve filled out almost constantly.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued just talking to each other for another two hours until Missy told him to go to bed as they had an early start the next morning. Missy changed into her lace nightie and also went to bed. Before she did though she made a wish that James would be completely honest with her as she had with Bobby all those months ago.<br />
The next morning Missy fed Thomas, Sarah and Bobby and let them play I the nursery for an hour with Abby whilst she went to wake up James. She walked in carrying a breakfast tray, she turned the light on and James woke up.<br />
&quot;Oh, hey miss Pueringer. How did you sleep?&quot;<br />
&quot;Very well actually. I made you some breakfast, some eggs, toast and some grapefruit there.&quot;<br />
&quot;oh, thanks um I hate to be a bother but um I don&#39;t like grapefruit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh really, well what fruit do you like?&quot;<br />
&quot;I really like melons and much bigger fruits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s just your look then, I have a seadless watermelon in the fridge.&quot; James smiled<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you know what I mean, I like your melons.&quot; Missy gasped and smacked James hard across the face. He flinched slightly and Missy stormed out of the room, she was sock of it, absolutely sick of men being disgusting to her because of her figure. She knew secretly ot was her fault but she was going to uphold her promise and James would be punished.<br />
She went into the bathroom, grabbed James&#39; washbag and wished that when he cleaned his teeth next he would regress to nine years old and that only he and her would notice.<br />
10 minutes later James came out of the bathroom screaming, he made all three of missy&#39;s children cry so Missy went to comfort them. James ran into the nursery, he had obviously regressed to a nine year old. Missy decided to play dumb and pretend she knew nothing, she told him he was crazy and made a few mental wishes to make his clothes change and all of his other belongings to suit his new body. What could she say she said he would <br />
 punished.<br />
&quot;Get changed James were going to the park later okay.&quot; Missy told him. James reluctantly went to get changed still confused as to what was going on. Missy turned to Abby telling her to get changed as well. Missy diapered and fed Thomas, Sarah and Bobby; clothed them and put them in the car. A minute later Abby came down and got in the car also, James was the last to get in the car and so he had to sit in the back.<br />
The journey was uneventful but short, Abby talked to Missy the whole way there but James said nothing, he just stared out of the window the whole way there.<br />
When they got to the park Abby went to go play with some other children, Missy pushed a stroller with all three of her children in it and carried both the diaper bag and a picnic basket. James went with her and helped her to set out the picnic blanket. Missy told him to go play with Abby and the other children whilst she fed Thomas, Sarah and Bobby. So James went and played tag for two hours it turned out he was quite enjoying himself.<br />
<br />
Eventually he and Abby both went to get lunch, Missy had made sandwiches for them both, they all sat and talked whilst they ate, well James didn&#39;t he was more concerned about his body and what was happening to it, he was so preoccupied that he didn&#39;t notice after drinking a lot that he had wet himself.<br />
Badly.<br />
Very badly.<br />
Infact James only noticed after missy did.<br />
&quot;Oh, well sorry Abby you&#39;ve been very well behaved bit your brother has wet himself, we&#39;ll. Have to go home, I don&#39;t have a diaper that big. And James don&#39;t you remember what I said yesterday, you will be punished okay&quot;.<br />
They got back in the car and drove back to Missy&#39;s house Abby went to go and play, Missy told James to give her his trousers and she would wash them as he went for a shower. As he was in the shower however Missy wished that when he next went to bed he would regress to be four years old, again also wishing that only she and him would know.<br />
Missy then went to Abby and congratulated her on being so well behaved.<br />
&quot;You deserve a reward Abby, what do you want?&quot; Asked Missy. Abby thought for a moment and eventually decided on what she wanted.<br />
&quot;I want to be older.&quot;</p>
