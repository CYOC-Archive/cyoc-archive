<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>CW: Loli, child giving birth</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After thinking about it a bit, Jane thought that staying like this would be fun, so she decided to stay pregnant for a little bit. The longer she waited, the harder the kicks got and she loved every minute of it.<br />
<br />
Ray watched her happily, moving her hands over her own large belly, feeling the babies move inside it. It took all her will power not to have sex with the little mother. Instead, she fingered herself, to clear her lust. When she finished, she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I must sadly leave you,&quot; she said &quot;there are others who would benefit from my magic.&quot; Then she asked softly&quot;May I have permission to come back when you give birth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Jane replied without hesitation, &quot; and Bella too, if she wants.&quot; she said looking at the other fairy, who nodded quickly.<br />
<br />
With another sigh, Ray flew off into the sky. As soon as she disappeared, Jane fell asleep again, happy and excited for the future.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
It had been a week since Ray entered Jane&#39;s life. A week filled with many pleasures, but many challenges, too.<br />
<br />
When her mother saw her the first time after her nap, she screamed. Nothing helped her calm down, even Jane reassuring her that she felt great. Her breasts felt wonderful, full of milk and sensitive, her womb still throbbed with life, and her pussy continued to drip juices as she came every other moment from her children. In fact it seemed to make things worse.<br />
<br />
Then came the visit to the doctor. The way there was already a pain, putting something together that would give her at least a little bit of modesty, even when she was shaking from pleasure, was a challenge. Then came the moving, as she felt exhausted after waddling for a few meters, when not brought low by another kick. And everyone stared at the hyper pregnant child, making feel conscious of her body and the wet splotches on shirt. The doc herself was baffled by the thing, too. Sixteen children was already unbelievable, but at the age of eight it should not be possible. The last day she visited them she even looked normal, her stomach looking as expected for a healthy child, today she is in her third semester, making abortion a legal impossibility. Not to forget the sexual pleasure the felt from her womb, which was abnormal. No one could find explanations for her condition.<br />
<br />
And Jane was not in a hurry to snitch on her fairy friends. <br />
<br />
After examining her on every level possible, they let her finally go after six hours, giving her mom a breast pump. During those long hours, her mind wandered between the joy of being pregnant and the anticipation of giving birth, making her shiver in excitement.<br />
<br />
Soon enough she arrived home and was helped unto her bed by her mother. They tried talking about everything under the sun except for her pregnancy, but nothing could bring her attention away from the brood inside her.<br />
<br />
After guiding her to her bed, her mother was preparing the breast pump. She explained how the machine worked and made sure Jane understood how to use it properly. After doing so, she went downstairs to get tea and snacks ready for her daughter.<br />
<br />
The milky girl sat on her bed and took the cups from the machine and stuck them unto her nipples, needing to fiddle a bit thanks to the size of her chest and belly. But once done, she began pumping. milk shoot out of her instantly and she whined at the pleasure her sensitive nipples gave her and the flow got stronger. Soon she found herself moaning louder and louder until she couldn&#39;t take any more and cried out loudly, cumming hard from the stimulation. Afterwards she collapsed onto her tits and belly, panting heavily.<br />
<br />
But her breasts were far from empty and needed more suctioning. However, she saw that the bottles of milk in the milker were already full. That meant that they needed changing. &quot;How many bottles will I go through?&quot; she asked herself. &quot;I hope many.&quot;<br />
<br />
She changed the bottles and started the pump again, cumming and filling two new ones before having to change them again. This process repeated itself several times, until the her breasts became empty at twelve bottles. She was spent from climaxing many times more, lying naked on her belly and boobs, her eyes closed. <br />
<br />
Her mother entered the room and brought the snacks and tea. &quot;At least it doesn&#39;t seem to hurt you.&quot; she said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
Days went on as the young mother found a rhythm. Pumping, eating food, pumping, watching, pumping again, sleeping... this was her life now. At night she dreamed of her fairy friend, flying around her in circles, touching her everywhere. Sometimes she woke up screaming from orgasms, most of the time waking her whole family. Also during the nights her breasts often leaked milk, soaking the sheets, while her vagina dripped fluids constantly.<br />
<br />
Her milk became a stable in the house and her favorite drink, her family not wanting to waste it, but most of it ended up down the drain as they could not keep up with her production.<br />
<br />
This morning, after a particularly strong orgasm, Jane awoke feeling very refreshed and happy. She smiled widely upon seeing her huge belly, knowing all babies within it belonged to her. A kick left her gasping in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Then she felt something in her womb, something pulsating. It sent waves of pleasure throughout her body, making her moan softly. As if to reward her, her womb released a flood of fluid, covering her hand in warm wetness.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; she asked herself. Then she saw Ray and Bella.<br />
<br />
Another wave hit her, causing her to shudder violently and fall on her back. Milk squirted from her nipples, falling on her. She moaned loudly, cumming harder than ever before. Another blast of liquid shot into her hands, drenching them completely. More squirts followed, coating the floor beneath her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your water breaking&quot; said Ray.<br />
<br />
Before she could comprehend what the fairy said, she saw stars, as her crotch exploded in another orgasm. She screamed loud, cumming uncontrollably. Her womb continued to release liquid, splashing against sheets below her.<br />
<br />
She then felt her move in her womb. Sensation filled her entire body, making her scream in ecstasy. Then came another explosion of pleasure, sending her over the edge yet again. The movement intensified, sending shock waves throughout her body.<br />
<br />
When she thought she would die from pleasure, she realized what was happening. Her cervix opened and she could only feel bliss radiating from there. With each orgasmic contraction, her womb pushed her baby a little bit down, slowly bringing it closer to coming out. <br />
<br />
As soon as she felt it crowning, a massive orgasm rocked her body, forcing her to arch her back and scream even louder. She let loose a torrent of milk, spraying everywhere. As her orgasm subsided, she let out a deep breath and lay still.<br />
<br />
Then shaked in bliss as the second child began its journey. She was cumming like crazy, unable to stop. Her arms and legs were shaking wildly as her baby moved further down her birth canal. Her second was crowning and she didn&#39;t care any more about anything else except giving birth. Then it came out. <br />
<br />
In no time she felt pressure build inside of her, signalling her third baby&#39;s arrival. She screamed in joy, her womb exploding in delight. Yet another orgasm ripped through her, more milk shooting through the air. A few drops landed on her face, dripping down her chin.<br />
<br />
So it went on for hours, one mind-breaking orgasm after another. Everything was perfect, every single moment. No pain, just pure pleasure. Nothing mattered other than birthing her children. After long hours of endless orgasms, she finally stopped. Every muscle relaxed, allowing her to breathe normally once more.<br />
<br />
With her last contractions, the sixteenth child was born, bringing an end to pregnancy. She laid exhausted on the bed and the fairies covered her with a sheet. All her children were asleep next to her. </p>
