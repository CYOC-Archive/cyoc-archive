<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle woke up the next morning with his next mission, he knew Mrs. Menedaz would be out for her morning walk in an hour, and he needed to get ready and go if he wanted to catch her. Mrs. Menedaz was and overweight Latin woman, she was a plump but beautiful woman, with a plump belly and noticeable curves she was the definition of milf. Kyle wondered if he&#39;d have to deal with her fat belly when he swapped her but he knew it had to be done so he didn&#39;t end up with her parts at the end.<br />
<br />
He got ready, ate breakfast and quickly made his way out the door, practically running down the sidewalk just to get to the bus stop. He reached the stop and waited, a few minutes later Mrs. Menedaz appeared like clockwork, and as usual she greeted him with hugs and kisses on the cheek, she did this with all the boys, some found it creepy, he found it endearing. He felt his lower half shift as they traded pleasantries and she continued her walk. Kyle looked down, relived that he didn&#39;t see her belly, but his lower half was now ridiculous, his thin waist ballooned out into hips that were measured at 58”, his new legs thicker than any he&#39;d seen, he blushed, grateful that his current shoes were a pair of tennis shoes he would be able to at least walk comfortably. <br />
<br />
Kyle spent the rest of his day comfortable with these legs, even though they barely fit in the seats at school, and his ass practically at the seat during lunch, he went about his day with the knowledge that on this his third day, he got the last of his do not want list done, now he was free to experiment for twenty eight more days. He made his way home and relaxed, not wanting to play with himself, having worn his libido down over the past two days, he was sure he&#39;d have more fun tomorrow with whoever&#39;s legs he ended up with. <br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Kyle sat down on his bed feeling exhausted, god his feet hurt, he looked down at the sexy legs he had gotten this morning. Of all the people he had to bump into, Mrs. Riviera, the Spanish teacher was the worst choice for shoes. Of course he was thrilled at first to have her legs, she had long, sexy legs, and a really nice ass, but it was when her shoes were copied that his heart sank. Mrs. Riviera was a bit of a show off, she had a few arguments with the PTA board about how she dressed, but they couldn&#39;t do anything, since what she wore from day to day was in the dress code and they didn&#39;t have a regulation on how high the teacher&#39;s heels are supposed to be. <br />
<br />
So here he was, with the killer hips and legs of the sexiest teacher in school, his beautiful feet clad in a classy, beige six inch heel. He thought that his mom&#39;s four inch heels were killer on his feet but this, this was ridiculous. <br />
<br />
“How the fuck do women stand these?” He grumbled, his mood to explore still with him, he pulled off his pants and boxers, walked down the hall on aching feet, and took a long hot shower, playing with Mrs. Riviera&#39;s pussy and enjoying the bliss of the feeling. After an hour of this he finally was satiated and spent the rest of his night enjoying the feeling of having long legs, finally being taller than his mother. He made mental note that he should at least try for long legs as his final pair.<br />
<br />
After school he explored the town, taking the option to walk home, since he wasn&#39;t too far away anyway, the bus to school was an option for rainy days after all. He noticed that new statues were around, aside from the one in the park there were several, some men, some women. Most were of modest or slightly taller height, ranging from six feet for most, to at tallest twelve feet. Kyle decided to browse what this new statue filled reality had, and found that there were a few much larger statues in the area, seemingly plucked from time and space, he made mental note to try and steer clear of the big ones, though it was tempting to try on one of his remaining 27 days. He wasn&#39;t sure he could handle having legs like Jen did. He also made mental note to try and steer clear of that wondering giantess, fortunately she seemed intent to leave him to his swapping, she continued going about business as usual and he&#39;d hear her walking by from time to time. <br />
<br />
He went to bed, feet aching from his ridiculous heels, thinking about who to aim for the next day as he drifted off.</p>
