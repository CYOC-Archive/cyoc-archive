<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A current trend on Tik Tok was changing your sex, especially with the couple sex swap challenge, where a couple would live a full year as the other sex. Eliza had been tagged several by her friends, and she didn&#39;t want to be left out. Almost the entirety of her friend group were now guys with girlfriends instead of boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Beyond just the challenge aspect, the couple sex swap challenge offered many avenues for content. There would be the obligatory befote and after, but also more potential Tik Toks, like trying each other&#39;s clothes, or discussing which gender has it better. Eliza did hope the challenge could boost her middlig Tik Tok presence.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Vincent couldn&#39;t care less about this challenge or what was happening on Tik Tok. Nevertheless, he did love his girlfriend, and she did seem to care about this a lot. Eliza begged and cried, and in the end, Vincent gave in. Even if they went the full length of the challenge, a year, it wasn&#39;t permanent, and it wasn&#39;t rare for couples to &#39;fail&#39; the challenge and swap back after tje minimum 6 months.<br />
<br />
Now, the couple was led to seperate rooms where they would change. Beyond a sex swap, there would be no further modifications as per the challenge&#39;s rules.<br />
<br />
Vincent took a last look at Eliza. She was a willowy blonde girl, with expressive blue eyes. He found her so cute, and it did pain him that she&#39;d become male. Though, he would become a girl, and a straight girl, so he hoped he would find Eliza&#39;s male form as appealing as her girl self, though it was hard to imagine.<br />
<br />
They said goodbye. Vincent was led to a barren room with just a bed. He laid down, and soon a doctor arrived to inject the nanomachines and sedatives. Immediately, after being injected, he dozed off.<br />
<br />
Vincent came to. His body felt heavy. He raised an arm. The movement was sluggish, but he managed to reach up. He looked at his arm. It was hairless, and what definition he&#39;d had before, mild veins and muscle, was gone. It was the arm of a girl, his arm. He touched his chest, first wanting to check if he had boobs. He felt some soft tissue there at his chest, though he had no idea how to gauge his size considering his doziness and overall unfamiliarity with his body.<br />
<br />
Vincent pushed himself off the bed, landing carefully on his feet. He could stand just fine. Walk too. It seemed like he had already gotten less groggy. Hair blocked his view, so he brushed his brown locks away, hair which was short before, now he felt it brush his upper back.<br />
<br />
He looked down at his chest, and there wasn&#39;t much there, barely a bump in his old shirt. It had felt like more back when he touched it on the bed, but now looking at it, grabbing his loose shirt, pulling the neck up so he can see his naked breasts, they&#39;re small.<br />
<br />
His shirt is big however, being more like a dress, which means he&#39;s small. Women in his family weren&#39;t tall, and it was based on genetics. Still, he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d end up at such a short stature due to his more than adequate male height, but comparing herself to her clothes, or the bed frame, she did seem very short, tiny, and petite. Vincent cringed.<br />
<br />
She should leave this room and see Eliza. She&#39;d had enough of checking herself out for now. She stepped out of the personal room, and walked towards the reception.<br />
<br />
There, she saw a man filming himself. And even as a guy, he immediately recognised him as Eliza. The same eyes, the same smile, and the same way of acting in front of a camera when making a Tik Tok.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is me as a man,&quot; he said and posed.<br />
<br />
Vincent waited until the the filming was over until approaching. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eliza?&quot; Vincent spoke up.<br />
<br />
Eliza turned and his eyes lit up. &quot;Omygod!&quot; Immediately he raised his phone to film Vincent. &quot;This is my boyfriend Vincent,&quot; he said. &quot;This is just after the change. Look at him, -er, her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vincent felt embarrassed about her new self being shared like this, but she&#39;d agreed to this. Sharing it was the most important part of the challenge after all.<br />
<br />
Several Tik Toks were made until Eliza had had enough, at least for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at all the views we&#39;re getting!&quot; Eliza cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm,&quot; Vincent nodded, a little tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at the comments too.&quot; Eliza showed some comments, and Vincent noticed something weird. Comments such as: &quot;Your boyfriend is super cute!&quot; or the more vulgar: &quot;That chick is so hot. I&#39;d fuck her even if she was a guy before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vincent blushed. She didn&#39;t feel like her body was all too special, yet they seemed to like it. It&#39;s a little embarrassing.<br />
<br />
&quot;They love you babe,&quot; Eliza said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s not good, right? It&#39;s your Tik Tok. Don&#39;t you want them to pay attention to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a couple challenge. It&#39;s about the two of us.&quot; Eliza placed his arm around Vincent. &quot;And I agree with them, you&#39;re super cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vincent yelped and turned red. It felt weird to have his arm around her. It emphasized how Eliza was the larger one now.. She looked up at Eliza. It was still Eliza, but with sharper features, narrower eyes. His face had lost its cute roundness. He was more masculine, and as he looked at her, his stare felt piercing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have so many Tik Tok ideas. It&#39;s going to be amazing,&quot; Eliza said.</p>
