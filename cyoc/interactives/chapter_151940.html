<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time he stepped through his door, Mike was starving. He opened his fridge and looked for something tasty but couldn&#39;t find anything that sounded good. He just stared confused, a couple of days ago the food he stocked in his fridge would&#39;ve sounded delicious. It was full of steaks, eggs, lunch meat and cheese, but none of this sounded good right now. Frustrated by his hunger and lack of options, Mike slammed his refrigerator.<br />
<br />
*knock knock* His door rattled and a feminine voice called out: &quot;Everything ok in there Mike? You sound angry.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was his next door neighbor, Jessica. &quot;Yeah.&quot; Mike called out as he made his way over to the door. Opening it he continued. &quot;I&#39;m starving but nothing in the fridge seems good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A stunned looking woman in her early twenties stood there staring at Mike, like she hadn&#39;t even heard what he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mike asked raising an eyebrow and looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d you get so tall?&quot; Jessica asked still slack jawed. &quot;You&#39;ve grown a full six inches since you left on Friday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Mike had forgotten all about how his human body had changed. He desperately tried to come up with a suitable excuse. &quot;I uh, ...uh, I&#39;m a late bloomer I guess.&quot; He stammered through a cheesy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! I haven&#39;t grown since high school.&quot; Jessica responded. &quot;Come on over, let&#39;s see if we can find you anything to eat. I just went grocery shopping yesterday so there&#39;s gotta be something you&#39;ll like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica was in her early twenties with wide hips, firm butt and small breasts. Her medium length brunette hair was up in a sloppy pony-tail, as if she had woken up not long ago. She lead Mike over to her apartment and stole a few glances at his enhanced body. She had never seen him this big or toned before, maybe he had just come back from the gym or something. There was something else too, Jessica couldn&#39;t quite put her finger on it, like an aura or a scent perhaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here we are.&quot; Jessica quipped. &quot;See anything that looks good?&quot; She opened her refrigerator door and stood back so Mike could get a good look.<br />
<br />
As he was digging through, Mike felt his nose twitch. It swelled a little and Mike knew it had changed slightly, bestowing him the ability to smell the food better. This must be what the doctor had been talking about when he said mental link, but how was he going to hide it from Jessica? Mike took a deep whiff trying to delay the inevitable. He was nervous and could feel his body tensing up, reacting to his fear and causing more changes. Trying to think fast he reached into the crisper drawer and pulled out a bag of carrots, which happened to smell amazing. Putting two and two together Mike shoved his face into the bag and hoped it hid his nose as he stood up and looked at Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find something you like?&quot; Jessica asked. She could tell something was up. Mike had his face buried in a bag of carrots and she could swear his pants had gotten tighter. On top of that a thick musk had began to permeate the room and she felt very warm.<br />
<br />
Jessica breathed deeply. She found the scent coming from Mike to be both comforting and arousing, like sharing a warm blanket with a fierce lover. She could feel her nipples stiffen and her sex moisten as her body betrayed her good intentions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike.&quot; She cooed. &quot;You look a little tense, would you like to sit down?&quot; Mike&#39;s pheromones had taken hold of her and all she could think about was sex.<br />
<br />
Mike had no idea what to do. He had come over to his neighbor&#39;s flat with the best of intentions and now he was in the process of transforming again right there in her kitchen. To make matter&#39;s worse her body&#39;s libido was being thrown into overdrive by the very same transformation. He was still managing to keep all his changed body parts hidden but he knew it wasn&#39;t going to last forever as his dick continued to grow in his pants. Trying to stall for time to think, Mike obliged Jessica&#39;s request taking a seat on a kitchen chair. &quot;You know, *munch-munch* I really have to be getting going.&quot; Mike managed to say through his food and changing mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no.&quot; Jessica sighed, stepping in front of Mike&#39;s chair. &quot;Surely, you could stay a little longer? Maybe I could help you, you seem to be having a little- *ahem* &#39;big-&#39; problem.&quot; Her gaze fell from his face down to the huge erection barely being contained by his pants.<br />
<br />
Mike was dumbstruck by the speed at which the situation had changed. He desperately tried to figure out what he should do but ultimately the decision was made for him.<br />
<br />
Jessica smiled as she reached her hand for his crotch. Her moist mound erupted love juice as she finally made contact with Mike&#39;s bulge. Her soft touch was the last straw for Mike&#39;s pants as they ripped open and his entire enhanced length sprung out like a cannon. He came.<br />
<br />
Thick, ropes of gooey spunk shot onto Jessica&#39;s face temporarily blinding her. Mike didn&#39;t have much time but he knew he had to act fast. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; he shouted. Dumping the carrots, he bolted for the door. His partially furred body looked like a blur as he tore through the apartment. He really hoped no one was out in the hallway but that was a risk he was going to have to take. He flew through the hall and slammed the door once he was safely in his own apartment.<br />
<br />
Jessica was beside herself as she finally came out of her trance. She wiped at her face trying to clear enough of Mike&#39;s thick semen to be able to see again. The goopy substance dripped and She licked up the salty seed covering her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa Mike,&quot; Jessica sighed lustfully. &quot;Your gravy tastes gooood.&quot;</p>
