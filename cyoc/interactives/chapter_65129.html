<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They stay a little feeling all the stink they exuded, reveling on each other stink... When they feel the canopy bed smashing them like pancakes. They are folded until they gone paper sized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what had you done?&quot; Asked Stripey, as he saw the assistant going and taking them like two smelly notebook. She is still using the gasmask<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about this... Well, you're toons now and you would Fell Down sooner or later, so better sooner than later, so you can get used to this.&quot; she said as she taken two transparent envelopes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fell Down?&quot; asked Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, time for Toon 101: I believe you know toons can't die, except on VERY RARE OCCASIONS, like being hit by Thinner... But even then, sometimes a toon can be hit so hard that you could die if you were human. We call this the Fall Down. You can't do anything except maybe talk when Fell Down. But it don't hurt more than a scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how much time we'll be this way?&quot; asked Stripey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it depends on the source of damage, its extension and circumstances. For example: if you ate TNT, normally half an hour until you're back to action. But some kinds of mega damage, like being on a ICBM ground zero, could make you be out of action by two or three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think in one hour you'll be okay. I'll give you a special service: we call it the Fallen Down Tour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fallen Down tour?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, so much people from 'real world' try to Fall Down ASAP when in ToonWorld. We couldn't make them lost lotsafun, right? So ToonWorld Tourism created the Fallen Down Tour, FDT for short, where we put the Fell Down on a bus and shows the places. It's like the normal city tour, just you can't make and take pictures. But I know some people are so hardcore FDT fans  they called itself the FDTnauts. The first thing they do is Falling Down and waiting the FDT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is madness!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say me... THIS. IS.TOONWORLD!!!!!&quot; she said, imitating the famous warrior. Then she laughed &quot;And then people said toons are crazy. Ah, and don't worry: Fall Down isn't a toon-exclusive behavior. There are some toon effects that are like physic laws and works for everyone. Sure 100% toons recover themselves from Fall Down sooner than humans, toonified or not. But it's easier for a human die from a nervous cardiac arrest from sheer panic after Falling Down than by the Fall Down itself. Not that this had ever happen, AFAIK.&quot; said the assistant, as she enveloped Stripey.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it's Toon 101, nah? So I have a question. May I ask her, Teacher?&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
The assistant taken a professor's hat and putted it over her head. &quot;Ask it, miss Rosie.&quot;, she said, as starts to put Rosie on her envelope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you said about no one dying here... And what about these cartoons sent to Heaven or Hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that? Well, you see: some kinds of mega damage, like being hit DIRECTLY by a thermo nuclear bomb, can make your body be really obliterated. We call this a Mega Fall Down. It's a rare situation: when this happen, a toon can't recover itself, and the toon stays Fell Down until he goes to the Heal-o-Matic to recover. And this is the only way to kill a human in ToonWorld, and this only work with 100% un-toonified humans. There was only one registered human death on ToonWorld by Mega Fall Down: a genius tried to eat a WMD and blast itself to atoms. You can recognize the Mega Felled Down guys: they are translucent, more than the &quot;live&quot; toon ghosts. A 100% human can't be Mega Falled Down, remember that if you receive humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the guys who walk through a cliff and don't fall?&quot; said Stripey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, the everyone favorite: Illogic Logic. You see: being smart on ToonWorld isn't always a good idea, as being dumb isn't always a bad idea. The physics on ToonWorld is, how can I say, toony: a little capricious and mischievous. Well, Illogic Logic works better on dumb toons, and it also don't works with 100% humans. The physics here appears to works only WHEN YOU REMEMBER IT. Well, dumb people sometimes forgets things like gravity and the need of breathing. So, when a toon try to cross a cliff, she can as long he don't think, even subconsciously, on it. From the moment she had the slight spark of knowledge about the physics, it works unforgivenly. So, even you being an inch from the other side of the cliff, you go down all the way down soon as you remember gravity.&quot; said the assistant. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have put on your pockets some books. I recommend you read 'Cartooning for Dummies' and 'Skunk 101: the Big Toon Skunk Book' as soon you recover on your flat. Yeah, I checked you on a good nuptial room on a cozy flat till you receive your toon papers and bank accounts so you can buy your own home, or tree, or hole, or wherever you want to live. Any doubts or problems, I put my business card on your pockets also. You just need to think on this and put your hands on your hips, like if you tried to put your hands on pants pocket.&quot; Said her, as they are flabbergasted &quot;My name is ZipZap, for instance. Any more  question?&quot; said ZipZap as she carried them out the room into the envelopes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... We made what skunks make when they make love each other... How could this room be used by non-skunks? It smelled like an medieval warzone.&quot; Asked Rosie<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn't want to do this before you. Some people says it's anti-skunk policy. I do this as it is my job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, we understand.&quot; said Stripey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... So...&quot; said ZipZap as they gone away from the room. Then she said to the now closed door. &quot;Engage SDP!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SDP engaged!&quot; said a robotic voice. And then they heard what sounded like a 747-turbomotor-powered hairdryer. Some seconds after, they heard a trapdoor being opened and what sounded like a howling hairspray jet. It last less than a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is SDP: Skunk Decontamination Process. Remember when I said that the skunk stink didn't turn toon skunks the most loved one? Well, this is 'cause skunk stink impregnate almost everything, even other toons. Normally, a good shower, washing clothes and some AirFresh works good 99% the times. But sometimes, specially after skunk love, this isn't just enough: and then SDP is the common option. First, some turbofan motors remove the stink from the air. This is stocked for use in transformations where some human want to stink like a skunk. Second, all the furnish is destroyed by fire and reconstructed or replaced. This include even bedsheets, towels, bathrobes, you name it. Third, a very big jolt of air freshener is placed on room, warranting no stink be left.&quot;, said ZipZap.<br />
<br />
&quot;My god!&quot; exclaimed both Stripey and Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Skunks were not the only stinking toons. Pigs, possums, trolls and even zombies stinks everywhere, and there also hobo and freeloaders. But only skunks are victims from prejudice. On 'Skunk 101' you'll read tips for hide and cope with the stink. I gave also some gasmasks for you. Don't worry about costs: it's part of a 'toon starter pack' so to speak. Skunks has some extra tips, just this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we understand. We know it's your job.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you're good sport.&quot; said ZipZap &quot;Some skunks are totally against this policies like SDP and others.&quot; as she returned to the information desk, they can see a sad dog who looks so much Droopy.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your conductor for the FDT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Giggles.&quot; said him, with the most unGiggleing voice. &quot;You are perm skunks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Rosie. She passed by a retoonification when her wife, now her husband, turned on a skunk, for love of him.&quot;  said ZipZap<br />
<br />
&quot;He did it?&quot; said monocordially Giggles &quot;I expect you be very happy!&quot; he said. They noted that even being monocordial,  Giggles was sincere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, they're ready? Should I bring him back here after?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need of. In  the envelope I placed the address of the hotel, and it's a skunk friendly one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. A good thing on working  on FDT: you can't stink when you're Fallen Down, even being a skunk. Right. Come on... The FDT is starting now.&quot;</p>
