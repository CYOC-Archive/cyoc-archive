<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the knowledge flooded into Ashlee, she visibly recoiled despite Dave’s efforts to negate the pain and discomfort.  Or perhaps it was just the shock of realisation hitting her.  Every wish that Dave had made, every change he’d orchestrated, and everything that had been told to him by Mr Prometheus was now known to her.  And Dave had his eyes turned away, his hands covering his eyes as he angst over how she would take it, fearing the worst.  <br />
<br />
After what felt like an eternity to Dave, but really just a minute, he heard a voice calling to him.  <br />
<br />
“Dave?”  His head rose up slightly as he heard it, his hands slowly leaving it.  “Dave?”  He turned to face Ashlee, his eyes now locking onto hers, a wild mix of emotions in hers, set against a stony face.  <br />
<br />
Which was probably why he never saw the palm that struck him across his snout, wincing from the sting it delivered.  As he used his left hand to rub at the afflicted area, his mouth hanging open, Ashlee spoke.  <br />
<br />
“That, was for all the crazy shit you’ve been doing.”  She spat out.  Dave wanted to turn away, the shame she made him feel being rather more than he was able to take, but found his neck unwilling to cooperate.  As he tried to take her words in, she was already in his face.  <br />
<br />
Which led to the next big shock for Dave, as her lips met with his snout for a long kiss.  Needless to say after the slap and scolding he’d just received, this caught him completely off guard and it was all he could do to try and not ruin the moment.  <br />
<br />
“And that’s for trying to help him, for trying to do something right.”  She answered the unspoken question when she broke the kiss.  Right before her right hand grabbed his balls and she gave them a very gentle, playful squeeze.  <br />
<br />
“And that one was for making it so easy for me!”  She giggled out, her free hand over her mouth as Dave’s snout snapped open and shut in his surprise at her rapid turn.  <br />
<br />
“Ash…Ash….Ashlee…..”  Dave kept gasping out, his ragged breaths quite audible to the both of them, and she looked like she was enjoying the sight of it.  <br />
<br />
“Now then, let’s take a good look at you.”  She moved the subject forwards as she took her hands and started running them over Dave’s body, feeling the way they slid and bumped over his green scales, running down one of his legs.  When her fingers slid over the bare sole of his foot, Dave couldn’t suppress the giggling and squirming that escaped him.  <br />
<br />
“Still ticklish then ?”  Ashlee teased him.  “Good.”  A sly smile form on her face at this revelation that something had remained exactly the same.  She worked her way back up, pausing to properly check how Dave’s penis now felt in her hands, given that it was larger now, before heading back up to his chest, back, arms, neck, head, and then his tail.  Finally she stopped and looked Dave in the eye again.  <br />
<br />
“Don’t get me wrong, you still made some very poor decisions, but at least you tried to do some right with it.  I still expect Nick, uh, Nikki to be aged back up though.”  That made Dave jolt.  <br />
<br />
“Shit.  I forgot about her.”  He gasped out, having actually forgotten all about her, and that she was still just a kid thanks to him.  “Damn.  I really didn’t think that one through.”  He admitted as he rubbed his head.  <br />
<br />
“No, you didn’t.”  Ashlee agreed.  “I can accept that the heat of the moment kept you from getting it right the first time, but I still expect you to fix it right now.”  She pointed to the paper, which Dave picked up and wrote on a little shakily.  <br />
<br />
‘Nikki is now her normal age of 31 years old.  Only Ashlee and myself will be aware of this.’  While he wouldn’t be able to see it happen, he hoped the result would be what he, and in particular she was after.  <br />
<br />
“Well, that’s one mistake fixed.”  He sighed as he put the Pen and paper down.  “And, uh, I’m sorry.”  <br />
<br />
“Sorry?”  Ashlee quizzed.  <br />
<br />
“For all the cock-ups that happened.  Like I said, I guess I really got drunk off of its power.  Sorry I had to put you through all that stress and that.”  <br />
<br />
“I know you are.”  Ashlee confessed.  “But like I said, you’re trying to do the right thing.  You proved that one when you told me the truth, and proved it to me.  Instead of trying to cover it up.  You just need to be a bit more careful with things like this, and a lot more self-controlled.  And at least you didn‘t try to chase any of those women.”  She finally embraced his bare, scaled body, resting her head against his thick chest.  <br />
<br />
“That said, I wanna use that pen.”  <br />
<br />
“What?”  After what Ashlee had told him, it did come as a surprise.  <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, it’s just for us.”  She sought to reassure him.  <br />
<br />
“Well then, it’s right there.”  Dave pointed to the coffee table where he’d set the Pen and paper down on.  Which Ashlee picked up before moving to the other side of the sofa where she prepared to make her own use of it.  <br />
<br />
“No peeking.”  She instructed Dave, who remained on his side wondering just what she was going to do with it.</p>
