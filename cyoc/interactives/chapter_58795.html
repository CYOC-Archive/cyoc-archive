<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Inside he found a head form with a dark red mid-back length wig, a collar with a tag that says ‘Robyn’ on it, what appears to be one complete set of female street clothes (blouse, jeans, bra, panties), and a purse.  Resigned to the fact that he already looks so feminine he decided the only way to get out was to put the stuff on and bluff his way out.<br />
<br />
He figured he should just go in order, so he took the wig off the head form.  On the inside he noticed two slits for his cat ears to go through.  He carefully puts it on, with his ears through the holes.  Suddenly he feels a burning, tingling sensation where the wig meets his scalp.  He tries to pull it off and realizes it is stuck, it is his hair now.<br />
<br />
Then he grabs the collar and puts it on.  As soon as the ends touch they melt together, the collar becoming seamless, and shrink till it fits snugly around his throat.  As soon as it is settled it melts into the suit, and then his whole body feels like it is burning and tingling.  He looks into the mirror and sees the suit molting and melting into his skin, the skin that is exposed though is not the skin he started the day with, as it is uncovered tiger striped fur is exposed.  Suddenly he got a migraine headache, clutching his head (with a slim feminine hand with retractable claws in them), he grabs the sides of a sink in front of him feeling like he’s going to throw up.  Then it is like all his thoughts and experiences are being pulled out of him and new ones are flowing in.<br />
<br />
Robyn opened her eyes.  She has been activated again.  Smiling, she thinks, ‘It must be Convention time again.’<br />
<br />
As she was thinking that she felt the air conditioner gently moving her fur, she looks down and notices she is naked.  Raising an eyebrow, ‘Strange,’ she thinks, ‘Robert normally likes to dress up and pretend before he activates me’.  Then she stood up and looked around.  She noticed she was in a public bathroom!!  What had he been thinking!  She might be a simulation of a woman but she was a highly accurate simulation of a woman acting and reacting like a natural woman would.  Slightly angry and embarrassed she started to look through her memories.  She had the complete memories of anyone who wore her as well as her own, and before she was removed she passed her most recent memories to her wearer.  Searching she found Robert’s memories, and then she found John’s!  It all became clear to her as she read John’s memories from the last hour.<br />
<br />
‘Poor human,’ she thought.  Then she grinned her catty smile, she would just have to show him what a good time was to be had as a tigress.  She always had fun at the Furry and Anthro Con’s and Boston had some of the best ones.  Besides, after looking in the suitcase she saw that Robert must have the desuiting equipment in her other bag.  She would just have to wear what she had and find him later.<br />
<br />
She quickly put on her undergarments, the blouse, and jeans (which were specifically tailored for her digitigrade legs and tail).  She then looked through her purse to make sure everything was there.  It was; her credit cards, cash, and ID with her name Robyn Jones on them was exactly where she had left them last time.  Then she looked at John’s ruined clothes.  He was right they could not be saved.  Though she did think he would want the stuff out of his pockets so she emptied them.  The cash and change went in the money pouch of her wallet.  The ID, pictures and credit cards went in a hidden pocket at the bottom of her wallet so they would not be lost.  His keys, watch, and cell phone went in her purse along with her wallet.  The wallet itself was old, ratty, and stinky ready to be replaced anyway so she put it with his old clothes.  Then she carefully put the clothes in the trash, they were still icky from earlier, and made sure they were on the bottom out of sight.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that John’s existence was cleaned up well enough for now, she put the head form back in its compartment and closed her empty suitcase.  She turns on her own cell phone and puts it back in her purse.  She puts her suitcase on the floor and wheels it to the door and leaves the bathroom.  As she exits she notices that John did her a favor, if anyone asked, by running into a unisex restroom where her exiting would go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
After she exits she glances around: should she try leaving the airport and going to the hotel Robert had booked for them to stay in this week, should she go to airport security and see if that was Robert that John saw being carried off, should she see if after all this John’s luggage came in after all?  <br />
<br />
I’ll let you decide.</p>
