<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Before you do that, tell me about the game. How are you doing this?” Paul asked.<br />
<br />
Finn chuckled, smoke puffing from his nostrils. “The game is a simulated reality. I can control everything about it. Things like time and space are irrelevant because of that very fact. Watch.”<br />
<br />
The dragon spread his claws wide and the crystal ball expanded as well. Within, Paul could see a Wolf, a Polar Bear, and a Weasel of some kind. They were dressed in adventuring gear and going to a tavern in a fantastical medieval city. Heavy rain was pounding the cobblestone streets and the three were carrying umbrellas.<br />
<br />
“This is Charlie and Jeff and Greg. So, as you can see, they are walking along their destination is clearly the tavern, right?” Finn said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, uh, I guess.”<br />
<br />
“They are. Give it a minute.” Finn waved a claw and the trio sped up, their voices rising high and unintelligible. They entered a tavern called the Sit and Swill. “There. See?”<br />
<br />
Paul shrugged. “Okay?”<br />
<br />
Finn sighed and waved a claw. The trio reversed out of the tavern back down the street. When they reached a point that Finn had first started this little show, the dragon flicked a claw, freezing them in place.<br />
<br />
“Paused.” Finn explained, folding his claws in front of him. “Usually, I let it go at normal speed. But if they’re sleeping at an inn and under no danger of attack, I fast forward. Because this is a simulation, so are they, in other words. But there are times when a GM needs to intervene or guides the narrative. For example, the rain was an event that washed out the bridge, trapping them in town for a few more days.”<br />
<br />
“For what purpose?” <br />
<br />
“Random roll.” Finn shrugged. “I set the program up with all the rolls in the DM’s book and other splats, including a bunch of third party content. Not, like, magic items, but things like settlements and locations and plot hooks.”<br />
<br />
“Must’ve taken you a while.” Paul marveled.<br />
<br />
“Not really. The AI I’m using just downloaded all the books and extrapolated. But, because I can intervene, I can do interesting things like this.” <br />
<br />
Finn twitched his claw and a drop down menu appeared. He selected ‘Red Dragon’ and inserted it into the game. Suddenly, a large red dragon appeared in the air above the party. Finn flicked his claw and the scene resumed.<br />
<br />
“Wait, if you throw a red dragon at them- !” Paul started.<br />
<br />
Fin held up a claw. Paul could only watch as the party turned and ran for cover. The town was suddenly bathed in fire. Finn fast forwarded and Paul gasped. The party was nothing but charred corpses. <br />
<br />
“You-you killed them!” Paul shouted.<br />
<br />
“Nope. Not permanently.” Finn flicked his claw, reversing time. The dragon was still there, but then he double tapped it with his finger and it disappeared. He flicked a claw again and the scene resumed, with the party crouching in the alley and blinking confusedly at the empty air. “And now it never happened.”<br />
<br />
“Where’s Chuck?” Paul asked. “I don’t see him.”<br />
<br />
“A better question would have been ‘when is Chuck’ – I dropped Hagerd into a tavern twenty years ago in the simulation.  I told him to wait in the general area until the party found him, and he’s been doing a good job of it.  He’s even had a few of his own little adventures in the meantime.”<br />
<br />
“So,” The dragon clapped his claws with a sharp clack, “What am I going to do with you…”<br />
<br />
Paul swallowed. “Uh, you said I’d have to suck your cock…”<br />
<br />
“Right, yes.” The dragon pulled up his phone and tapped in some information. “But you also said you’d be my sexy little kobold slave.”<br />
<br />
“W-wait!” Paul said. “Can we just do dragonborn?”<br />
<br />
“No. I want my little sex pot kobold.” Finn’s scaly lips curled, showing off his large fangs.<br />
<br />
“Alright, but before you…tap my information into the phone and change me, I have two more questions!” Paul stuttered.<br />
<br />
“No stalling!” <br />
<br />
“I’m not! I just want to verify somethings. What happens when we defeat the Big Bad and save the world?”<br />
<br />
Finn paused. “If you beat the campaign? Well, the simulation ends.”<br />
<br />
“But will I be a kobold?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” Finn tapped a claw on his scaly chin. “I haven’t really come up with a campaign reward. Honestly, I was just going to turn us all back to normal and congratulate everyone on a good game.”<br />
<br />
“Can I be a dragon if we win?” Paul asked insistently.<br />
<br />
“You are so one-track minded.” Finn rolled his slitted orbs. “If that’s what you really want at the end of the campaign, sure.”<br />
<br />
“One last thing.” <br />
<br />
“Hurry up.”<br />
<br />
“What if we lose?”<br />
<br />
Finn narrowed his eyes. “Punishment forms.”<br />
<br />
“Bro.” Paul said. “Not cool.”<br />
<br />
“For one year. I need to build another campaign.” Finn conceded. “Then we play another game. Could be anything. DnD, Cyberpunk, Post-Apoc, Sci-Fi like Wars Stars and even Weird West settings are on the table. I’ll change the losers into something more…satisfactory and then have a vote. <br />
<br />
“You’re rebuilding the campaign?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a bit janky right now. I want to adjust parameters and stuff.” Finn explained.<br />
<br />
“Alright you sunovabitch, I’m in.” Paul licked his lips. “Now let’s see that dick!”<br />
<br />
“Oh ho, confident, are you?” Finn grinned, rubbing himself.<br />
<br />
“I have dreamed of sucking dragon cock since I was 13 and found scaly porn.” Paul grinned and rubbed his hands, eyeing Finn’s vent eagerly. “Come on!”<br />
<br />
Finn continued rubbing himself. A large, pink snake-like organ emerged from his vent, rising out into the cool basement air. Paul’s jaw dropped as it continued to rise. At two feet in length, it stopped. Paul stepped forward, about to put the draconic organ in his mouth when it suddenly split in two, strands of slimy pre-cum connecting them.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you see now, don’t you?” Finn’s scaly brows raised. “My immense hemipenes?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Paul gasped. “It-it can’t be!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that’s right. If you want to pleasure me, you’ll have to learn… multi-cock sucking!” Finn chortled.<br />
<br />
“How could I…” Paul dropped his faux shocked persona and glared at Finn. “No, seriously, how the hell do I fit those in my mouth?”<br />
<br />
“Snout.” Finn corrected, his claw tapping ‘enter’ on his phone.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Paul’s clothes vanished.<br />
<br />
He stumbled, having dropped half an inch when his shoes and their slight lift disappeared. Finn caught him in his hugely muscular arms and steadied the man as his back began to ache. Paul found his balance and Finn let the man go, the dragon smiling as he saw something begin to protrude from just above Paul’s ass.<br />
<br />
Paul felt the ache intensify and reached back just in time to feel a strange bump at the base of his spine. It started lurching out in a series of pops. He tried to wrap his hand around it but his pinky refused to bend. The man paused his inspection of the new appendage and brought his hand back into view.<br />
<br />
He stared as the skin of his hand changed color, pink flesh deepening to red and hardening. His skin pinched and prickled, a feeling spreading up his arms and across his body as hundreds of bony plates began to interconnect. His fingers twitched and he could only watch as his unresponsive pinkie finger shriveled away. The rest of his digits puffed, his nails sharpening and thickening into claws.<br />
<br />
With every passing moment, more of his tender human skin was replaced with crimson scales, almost identical to that of Finn’s. It crept up his face and over the top of his head, clumps of hair falling out and onto the floor between his feet. Finn gingerly touched his scaly face as it began to creak out into hard reptilian ridges, teeth sharpening and nostrils growing into slits as he gained a snout.<br />
<br />
The stumpy tail continued to creak out behind him while he inspected his new face. Fat and muscles formed on his scaly ass cheeks, more than necessary to support his growing tail. As soon as Finn’s face finished cracking and popping into proper kobold configuration, his tail exploded out, spine popping.<br />
<br />
Paul grunted from the odd, pleasurable release of tension in his spine as his tail finished growing. He scraped his claws along the scales and shuddered.  Giving his hips a slight wriggle produced an unfamiliar sensation as his new tail wagged slowly in tune, new muscles twitching and flexing. Paul realized he could control it and found it could wrap around his own torso.<br />
<br />
While he was busy playing around with his tail, the heels of his feet rose from the cold floor. His toes popped and cracked as they lengthened, nails transforming into large, raptor-like talons. Paul shuffled around on his new appendages, tail swaying from side to side as a counterbalance. He lifted his feet, waggling his clawed toes and noticed the clumps of his human hair that lay near his feet were rushing up to greet him.<br />
<br />
Paul looked around in time to see a large red kneecap filling the view in front of him.  Just seconds ago, Finn the dragon had already towered over Paul the human, but the difference in size between dragon and newly minted kobold was startling – Paul couldn’t imagine that his new body stood any more than two and a half feet high. <br />
<br />
“Oh my,” A deep voice boomed. “You are rather tiny, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
Paul yipped and unthinkingly grabbed his tail and clutched it to his chest, staring up in shock at the figure above him.<br />
<br />
Finn’s relatively huge, draconic form towered over him, a grin on his face. The sight of the enormous dragon sent strange thrills through the little kobold’s mind, and Finn found himself relaxing, releasing his tail and letting it raise in the air above him. <br />
<br />
By now, Finn’s casual masturbation had released a cloud of potent musk. One sniff later and Paul’s brain went haywire. He scrambled over to the dragon as a massive hand closed around his torso.  Paul found himself lifted into the air until his lizard-like muzzle was positioned directly in front of the dragons glistening hemipenes.<br />
<br />
The cocks were as big as he was, and the best he could do was run a thin, snakelike tongue over them.  Still, the sound of the dragon chuckle and moan happily above him let him know that he was pleasing his new master.<br />
<br />
Those happy draconic noises filled his mind with an instinctive pleasure.  Paul was a good kobold! The dragon liked him!<br />
<br />
His own cock emerged from his vent, its minor changes having gone completely unnoticed by Paul. Sufficiently edged by the kobold, the dragon reached down with his free hand and began to stroke himself, causing small spurts of precum to fling at the kobold.. Paul couldn’t help but bask in the sticky fluids his master had generously bestowed up on him.<br />
<br />
“Such an eager little thing.” Finn bent down and licked the kobold’s slimy head.<br />
<br />
“Me love Finn!” Paul yapped, lost in sensual bliss. <br />
<br />
“I suppose you won’t be doing much sucking with such a small body.” Finn scratched the base of his horns with one claw while leaning back and continuing to slowly pump his magnificent cocks.<br />
<br />
Paul writhed in delight as he was completely bathed in the draconic fluids. Distantly, he could hear the dragon clacking away with his claws at his cellphone. All the little kobold could think of was how wonderful he felt, his cock sandwiched between Finn’s hemipenes. It soon grew into a sudden rush of need and pleasure, his balls tensing inside of his slit.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel now?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Palseks feel good, master!” Palseks voice was high, tail wagging happily behind him.<br />
<br />
The dragon continued to stroke, jostling Palseks body. <br />
.<br />
<br />
“Oh~” Palseks gasped, his voice rising higher and that claw gently pushed his member back. “F-Finn!”<br />
<br />
Finn grinned, continuing to slowly press Palseks cock inside of him. <br />
<br />
Palseks shuddered, clinging to the dragon’s muscular arm and moaning desperately. The claw teased his shaft, using the smooth side to stroke the head.   Fluid began to seep out from his vent as a shrinking cock  retreated into the slit. Finn cheekily tweaked Palseks cockhead before pressing the tip up into the kobold’s body with a wet squelch. <br />
<br />
The claw gently rotated, squishing deeply into a tunnel forming in her new orifice, rearranging her insides. As the claw moved, the outer edges of her new pussy pulsated and plumped into a scaly gash.  A few more swishes of the claw, her insides rumbling, and her slit spread into glistening feminine folds, beads of musky fluid dripping from it. <br />
<br />
Finn removed the claws only to replace it with his forked tongue, flicking it deeper and deeper into the kobold, tasting her. Palseks shivered and gasped, her vent spasming and shooting clear fluid across the dragon’s probing tongue. Floral musk steamed from her newly formed cunt and Palseks found herself humping the air desperately. Her new genitals were so hot and needy, not even the dragon’s tongue could fill her.<br />
<br />
Palseks ran a claw over her own flat, scaley chest, all while Finn dangled the horny kobold above the his cock. The dragon’s pink, prehensile shafts stuck out from his creamy underbelly and writhed eagerly, probing at the kobold&#39;s exposed vent. With a firm push, the dragon impaled the little kobold on his length, pressing into her vent and then further into two distinct passageways – stretching Palseks pussy wide open and burrowing deep into the kobold’s asshole at the same time, distending her form. <br />
<br />
Finn sat back on his hindquarters and held Palseks in place, gently sliding her down his dragon cocks and then pulling her back up, pleasuring himself with the kobold like she was nothing more than a plaything. Which is exactly what she was.<br />
<br />
A tingle spread across her brain as it began to heat up. As pleasure rippled through the kobold’s body, her mind attempted to refocus, only for her to realize that she couldn’t remember what her old life was like. She recalled being a male human, but the experience was devoid of any feeling or meaning. <br />
<br />
All of her old wants and desires seemed so far away, so pointless.  The tingling in her head increased  as neurons rewired themselves into a new purpose.  Where her human brain had existed to help her lead a balanced, well rounded life, her new kobold brain served a single purpose: dragons.  Like a living robot, her brain rewrote itself to love dragons.  To obey dragons.  To serve dragons.  Nearly every pathway or synapse that would allow her to think of anything else just ceased to exist.<br />
<br />
She squirmed, sure she was forgetting something important.  But with her concentration lost, the memory of forgetting was lost as was the fear behind it, bursting like a bubble. It didn’t matter. She could feel his cock squirm around inside of her, her walls clenching and squeezing that wondrous cock in return.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finn pumped her up and down faster and faster. Their moans rose and rose. Palseks wasn’t sure how long she could keep herself from cumming before Master did.  Not that her cumming would stop master, she just didn’t think it would be appropriate for a kobold such as herself to cum first.  Fortunately for her, that wouldn’t be a problem.<br />
<br />
With a roar, Finn came inside of her, filling her womb and rump with copious amounts of magma-hot cum. But he didn’t pull her off, instead holding her tightly against his crotch as balls pulsated as he pumped and pumped. Finally, sheer pressure from the veritable cum fountains that were the dragon’s hemipenes forced her out,ribbons of creamy steaming spooge pouring out of both the dragon’s cock and the kobold’s own cunt, showering her in dragon cum.<br />
<br />
Palseks was moaning in the dragon’s grasp when she thought she heard a door opening upstairs.<br />
<br />
Then, the sound of shoes clomping down the stiars caught her attention. Palseks looked over at the basement stairs just in time to see two people’s legs enter into her field of vision. But before she could say or do anything, she felt her body fly forward as Finn flung her against the hard concrete floor.<br />
<br />
Around her, the walls faded away, replaced by stone and mortar. The last thing she saw of the real world her friends Tom and Ben, who stared at her with poorly hidden disgust. It made her a bit self-aware and more than a little mad that they would be so judgmental.<br />
<br />
And then she was gone as a medieval prison cell rose around her.<br />
<br />
Palseks found herself laying on her belly against a rough stone floor. It was cold, though the thick straw that sprung up underneath her made it made it less so. <br />
<br />
She blinked.  But in the brief instant that her eyes were closed, two scaled, reptilian talons had materialized a fraction of an inch from the end of her muzzle.  <br />
<br />
Shaking, she looked up.<br />
<br />
It was a large kobold male with ropy muscles that flexed under his leather armor. His scales were a dull rust color, and his features were rather plain. His cock was erect, cum slicking his cock and dripping to the floor between his feet. <br />
<br />
She swallowed and coughed, tasting cum in her mouth.<br />
<br />
A thought wiggled its way into her mind -  whose cum was she tasting? Was it the base cum of a common kobold, or the divine cum of Finn the Dragon God? It didn’t taste like a god, but then again was that how Finn’s cum had tasted just a moment ago? <br />
<br />
She didn’t remember anything special about the taste when she had sucked off Finn, but somehow that just seemed wrong – she must just have been overwhelmed by his grandeur and divinity.  At least she could still feel the warm seed oozing onto the floor from her overfilled vent, so perhaps that, at least, was Finn’s.<br />
<br />
“You clean!” The kobold demanded, pointing at his mottled pink and gray length.<br />
<br />
Palseks inched herself forward on her knees, opening her maw automatically, as though she was under some strange compulsion. But just before she could suck that dirty cock, heavy boots stomped in the hall behind the ugly male and a massive shadow filled the doorway.<br />
<br />
“What you do with slave, Karsor?” A deep, raspy voice boomed.<br />
<br />
The ugly male, Karsor, jumped a foot in the air and whirled. He threw up a salute, his cock quivering and slowly wilting under the glare of the newer, bigger kobold. As Karsor’s master stepped into the light, Palseks couldn’t help but gasp.<br />
<br />
This new kobold was massive, with a stout body covered in thick bands of muscle. His snout was broad and more like a crocodile’s, two teeth jutting from his bottom jaw. And unlike the other kobold, whose scale’s dull coloration were an obvious brand of his lowly rank, this one had scales of a deep navy blue that glittered glossily under the light of the torch. The deep scars of a seasoned warrior crisscrossed his arms and face, while his leather armor was well-oiled and maintained, as was his banded iron club.<br />
<br />
“Rakser, wait..” The kobold male said, holding up his hands, “it-it not what it look like-YIP!” <br />
<br />
“Enough!” Rakser roared, as he charged forward and flung the kobold off of Palseks. “You not touch goods!”<br />
<br />
“But she not in heat!” the kobold protested, shaking itself off. “She fine!”<br />
<br />
“Get out!” Rakser said sternly.<br />
<br />
Karsor shot her a venomous look before scuttling off. Rakser snorted angrily and waited for him to leave before turning to her. She thought his gaze softened slightly, his glowing yellow eyes loosing a bit of that horrid glare.<br />
<br />
“You not damaged?” Rakser asked.<br />
<br />
“No. Thanks.” Palseks said.<br />
<br />
“Hah, thank!  That good one!  Rasker not care about thanks from lowly slave.” Rakser said as he turned and stomped to the door. <br />
<br />
“W-wait!” Palseks cried as she tried tostumble after him, only for a crude cell door to slam callously into her snout.</p>
