<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrea walked out through the mall, marveling at how... NORMAL everything was. All manner of girls went about their business like always, totally unaware that she’d just rewritten their whole world. While she’d love to shop or talk to people, She really wanted to know what it was like back at home. Would her siblings all be sisters? Would dad still be super short? What would her room look like?<br />
<br />
Out in the parking lot, she waited at the bus stop. There was a couple there, kissing and babbling sweet nothings at each other. Interestingly, she noticed they both had extras in their pants. So apparently nobody minded what equipment you had when it came to relationships. The bus came and Andrea fed her two bucks into the machine to pay the fare. Glancing at the money, she remarked to herself that Georgia Washington had been a very regal lady. History was all going to be different now, and that was weird to think about.<br />
<br />
The bus ride was uneventful, much like it was before. Cars, trees, buildings. But with no men, it still held a surreal edge. He passed a statue in a roundabout downtown which had always shown a soldier on horseback, but now it was different in more ways than one. The woman depicted now led the horse on foot, and carried a musket instead of a saber. Ads all over the place screamed about the new star wars movie, and seeing a maturely attractive Hannah Solo was peculiar. Some things, however, were strangely unchanged, like some giant graffiti of a dick all up the side of a construction wall.<br />
<br />
Finally the bus reached her stop, and Andrea got off, walking the block or two through her neighborhood. It was idyllic, the sun shining, a few kids out playing in a yard. Her next-door neighbor Chelsea was jumping on a trampoline in her backyard, and Andrea was glad to see her crush on Chelsea carried over from her past life. SO bouncy. Woo!<br />
She opened her front door, a little anxious at meeting her transformed family. The living room looked the same as ever, with its subdued but comforting décor and modestly high-end tv, game consoles, and such. Her mom was doing some wii fit exercises, and glanced over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hi andrea. Have fun at the mall?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, mom. It was great. I went to the new arcade.” <br />
<br />
“Ooh fun,” she replied, bending into the next yoga pose. “Hun, would you do me a favor and tell your dad she still needs to get off her butt and exercise with me? She’s getting pudgy.” <br />
Andrea laughed. Mom had always said things like that. And it’s true, dad WAS a little heavier than average, but not by much.<br />
<br />
“Sure mom. Where is h- uh, she?”<br />
<br />
“In the garage, like always.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” she said as she headed through the kitchen to the garage door. She snagged a soda out of the fridge on the way, and took a deep drink. This was the best day ever.<br />
<br />
Dad wasn’t working on an old mustang like when she’d been male, but a crotch-rocket type sports bike. “Hiya Andy. That soda for me?” Dad was still short, still a tad pudgy, but she carried it well. Her smile was flawless and her face and skin were enviable.<br />
<br />
“Haha, nope. All mine. But mom wants you to go do wii stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I thought so. Oh well, I’ve put it off long enough.” She leaned in conspiratorially. “To tell the truth, I‘ve been sitting in here texting for over an hour. Don’t tell mom.”<br />
<br />
She chuckled and followed her dad out of the garage, but while dad stayed in the kitchen to talk to mom, Andrea went to her room. It was up the stairs, and as she started ascending, something barreled past her, nearly making her spill the soda. She glanced back to see a young girl opening the front door. Based on the black hair and skinny arms, she guessed this had to be Michael, her youngest brother. Or sister, now. Still twelve years old, though.<br />
<br />
“Michelle?”<br />
<br />
Michelle turned around like she’d been caught at something. “What’d I do?”<br />
<br />
“Just wondering where you were off to.”<br />
<br />
“Down the street to Billie’s. She got a new DS… Don’t tell mom, I’m supposed to be grounded.” Andrea remembered, Michael had pulled another boy’s pants down in class. But that was a world away.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but be careful. And don’t be gone for more than an hour. They’re doing yoga stuff.”<br />
<br />
Michelle smiled gratefully and quietly slipped out the door and away. Andrea continued up the stairs. She passed by the twins’ room, feeling really loud bass-heavy music throbbing through the floor and walls. She peeked through the cracked door. Both of her 19-year old sisters were dancing to the beat, though Joan was at the desk mixing this particular beat while Jenna just went nuts with it. Music students the both of them, they were actually pretty good. Andrea was a little surprised to see them both just in undergarments, too lazy to get dressed on a weekend. Both their crotches bulged now.<br />
<br />
This was surreal. She was a girl now, and her sisters were male ‘under the hood.’ She hadn’t actually noticed with Michelle, but thinking about her younger sister naked made her uncomfortable. Her own room was a little different than she remembered. It was tidy, for one thing. The carpet was visible, instead of a layer of clothes and books and things. But there were also subtle changes, like her much larger collection of clothes in the closet. A poster that used to be for some eighties movie now proclaimed her love for the avengers, and her desk was littered with sheets of paper on which handwritten stories were begun, but not yet finished. There had to be a few dozen of them.<br />
<br />
“I guess girl-me finally started to get my ideas down on paper…” Andrea really wanted to be a novelist someday. But writer’s block and procrastination were always in her way. Glancing the pages, some were unfamiliar, but undoubtedly good stuff. She was satisfied with the quality now.<br />
<br />
Exploring further, her dresser drawers contained much more feminine stuff than she’d expected. After all, she was wearing a tube top now. Her underwear drawer had a huge amount of racy lingerie, and there was something heavy underneath. She lifted up a stack of lacy things to reveal a thick purple dildo, and blushed. It was a serious piece of equipment, with ribs and nubs and it looked like it could break bones if you set it too high.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, Andrea. You naughty thing.”</p>
