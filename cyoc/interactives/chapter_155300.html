<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	The Van Direstags spent the evening eating a prepared dinner.  Although unspoken, each of them had worries on their minds.  What should they do about the Mandatory Were law?  Should they become weres?  What would happen if they refuse?  For Rob, he was still getting his mind around the idea that weres existed at all.  He didn’t see Samantha Twist when she visited, and he had suspected that Amy was a were.  Maybe he should ask her about it.<br />
<br />
	Rachel had her own worries.  What her parents told her about Samantha’s visit confirmed what Melissa Jenkins said to her earlier that afternoon.  Mel was a werecow, and she did look happy.  Should Rachel also make the plunge?  What would that mean for her future career on the internet?  How would she change?  Could she accept the changes?  Could her father accept the changes?  It was then that she had an idea.<br />
<br />
	“May I be excused?” she asked as she finished the food on her plate.  When Rose nodded her head, she took the plate to the kitchen before making her way to her bedroom.  Once there, she took the Moon Lake Manual along with a piece of paper and started to read through the book.  She read all of the entries in the book and on her piece of paper, she wrote down the types that interested her.  Several hours later, she had a rather lengthy list.<br />
<br />
Werewolf<br />
Weretiger<br />
Werecougar<br />
Wereleopard<br />
Werefox<br />
Werehorse<br />
Werecow<br />
Wererabbit<br />
Werebear<br />
Weregorilla<br />
<br />
After she wrote down her list, she took one last look at the list.  Remembering her dream from the previous night and she crossed off “Werewolf” from her list.  At that moment, she felt very drowsy and fell asleep at her desk.<br />
<br />
The next thing she remembered, she was in some sort of white room somewhere.  She looked down to find that she was completely naked, and she screeched as she tried to cover herself with her arms.  “Hey,” she heard a deep female voice call out, “we’re all you here.”  She looked around and saw that there were various weres around.  They were all different types, but they had all one or two common traits that seem to indicate that they were all the same person.  Her.<br />
<br />
“I suppose you’re right,” she said as she relaxed her stance.  “I mean, this is a dream, right?”<br />
<br />
“In a sense, yes,” a weretiger answered as she approached Rachel, “But in a sense no.”  She waved a paw at all the various weres that were around her.  Rachel looked around at the various weres and noticed that they all matched the weres on her list.  “We’re all possible future versions of you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s true,” she said, “and you’re all on my list.  But there’s a couple of things.”  She pointed to the werewolf version of Rachel and said, “I crossed you off my list so you’re not supposed to be here.  And I also noticed that my normal self isn’t here.”<br />
<br />
“That’s because we’re here to give you a warning,” the werewolf said as she walked closer to Rachel.  “You see, tomorrow, something’ll happen that’ll make dad do something rather…stupid.  And the day after that, he’ll follow through with that stupid thing that’ll cause the whole family to get changed.  Into werewolves.  Involuntarily.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, so you’re saying…” Rachel asked as she looked at the werewolf.<br />
<br />
“I’m the future you that doesn’t make a decision.  The town decided to make us all werewolves, and I’m the result.  All because dad did something stupid the day after tomorrow.”  The werewolf sighed as she said, “Let’s just say that it wasn’t very pleasant.”<br />
<br />
“I…I see,” Rachel stammered.  “What should I do?”<br />
<br />
“I think you should decide what were you should be and go through it tomorrow night,” the werecow version of herself said.  “I mean, you’ll have to go behind your dad’s back, and he might not like it, but that way, your choice will be yours.”  Rachel noticed that out of all the weres there, the werecow had the biggest chest.  Looking around, Rachel noticed that all the breasts were relatively big given their sizes.<br />
<br />
“And don’t forget about the birth control pills,” the wereleopard added in, “Unless you want to be a teenage mom.”<br />
<br />
“I…hadn’t thought about that,” Rachel muttered to herself as she rubbed her stomach.  “So, I need to decide on which group to join, find someone to change me, and do this all by the day after tomorrow?”  She ran a hand through her hair.  “Oh, and don’t forget about birth control pills.  Not a tall order at all.”<br />
<br />
“Hey,” the werefox said as she put a hand on Rachel’s shoulder, “You’ll get through this.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Rachel replied before taking a look at the werefox version of herself.  She ran a hand through the fur on the werefox’s hips before running it up her body.  The werefox even allowed Rachel to feel her rather large breasts in her hand, testing their weight.  “Wow,” Rachel said, “You’re beautiful.”<br />
<br />
The werevixen smiled and said, “I know.  And I’m you, remember?”  Rachel released the werevixen’s breast as she continued, “And don’t forget our warning.  If you’re going to do something, tonight’s the night to do it.”<br />
<br />
It was at that point that Rachel woke up and found herself back at her desk.  She looked through the window to find the sun starting to rise over the mountains.  “Mel…I need to talk to Mel.”</p>
