<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie -so- detested the 'in the fur rule' not only was she supposed to not wear anything <br />
but equipment when interacting with guests, she also had to do the same when interacting <br />
with the new pack mates until they were broken in. The two lady huskies in the pack that <br />
loved to tease her about her preferences had 'requested' that she held spare with the new <br />
huskies teaching them the different hand to hands they'd need to deal with park guests <br />
who got out of hand. She didn't feel like bargaining with Harry for his work shift today <br />
after her delicate job of enticing the mothers to be to agree to their examinations. <br />
<br />
She found Naomi silently watching the new huskies slowly having their self defense drilled <br />
into them. Katie pitied them, after this came emergency first aid, code of park conduct, <br />
then advanced first aid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything go smoothly?&quot; Naomi asked not taking her eyes off the huskies. <br />
<br />
Katie bowed ever so slightly to her alpha. &quot;The panthers are still in the medical ward taking <br />
in every piece of advice the doctors can give them, since they aren't sure where the draw <br />
the line, they're giving them a course on human -and- cat pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again. Er, how did your assignment go?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Almost too perfect. The doe, Jenny, accepted Spike without a hitch, and double for Spike, <br />
I just hope they don't forget Spike leaves with, well, -most- of the frat in two weeks time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam.&quot; Katie didn't want to get too deep into this discussion, knowing Naomi's <br />
opinion on men in general, and knowing better to challenge her pack leader. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how are the deer?&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Just the opposite for Jackie and Keith, Jeremy and Leticia were actually, in spite of <br />
themselves, disappointed to learn that Leticia was only carrying one fawn. After all, does <br />
were prone to twins, though triplets and singular births did occur on rare occasions. This <br />
led to Jeremy and Leticia having a moment of self evaluation, but thankfully, it didn't last <br />
long. After all, both deer thought even if they didn't say it, they could always try again. <br />
<br />
At the same time, the weight of responsibility began to pull a bit more at both of their <br />
minds. The reality of how deep they were in being strengthened. Regardless of the truth <br />
that both Jeremy and Leticia were both fully aware of, Jeremy and Leticia couldn't help but <br />
smirk at the idea of their fawn becoming a proud herd leader given time. Even if they knew <br />
the park itself was six tenths fantasy.<br />
<br />
Though there was a flaw in the fantasy. While Jeremy had found the courage to face up the <br />
shadow of his mother. Leticia had instead of thinking what she was going to say to her <br />
girlfriend on the other side, had pushed it farther, and farther away from her mind. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Then there were three.&quot; Lateisha said to the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm?&quot; Su Yin narrowed her eyes ever so slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now there are three of us. Leticia is with Jeremy. And now Jenny is looking after Spike. I <br />
feel as though they've left our entourage.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess we might have some primate instincts left in us after all,&quot; Su Yin said then <br />
continued before she could be interrupted, &quot;Deer don't exactly care when other deer join <br />
another group. The whole point of the herd after all is mutual protection from predators.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't apes pretty much the same way?&quot; Lateisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, maybe not. The point is, no matter how much our instincts have more of a say in <br />
our decisions, we ourselves, still have final say.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I doubt they'd be commercializing this if we ended up basically instinct controlled <br />
animals on two legs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't forget, while they aren't staying hidden, the park IS staying low brow. Possible in <br />
case something DOES go wrong, the media won't eat them alive.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah decided to continue to keep her own personal discussion with the management <br />
secret. She didn't know if she had been told things guests weren't supposed to know, so <br />
figured it was better to be safe than sorry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello everyone.&quot; Said Jenny, out of the blue back among her fellow does, catching them <br />
off guard. <br />
<br />
Su Yin known for her self control gauged Jenny, she seemed more mellow in her voice, <br />
calmer in her motions,  slightly more reserved. If Monty had been there he'd have <br />
screamed brain transplant. <br />
<br />
But Jenny didn't have spot light for long as the does' attention shifted to the fawn right <br />
besides her holding her hoof/hand in his. <br />
<br />
Okay, Hannah knew, logically, this had to be Spike. That was what Jenny and the Husky <br />
had talked about. But either Spike was a post-collage level  professional actor, or Hannah <br />
just didn't see it. There was none of that same fearsome persona here. No presence of <br />
dominance, no fear inspiring gaze, no network of scars. And no giant set of antlers. Could <br />
this really be the same buck that Sam had laid to waste? <br />
<br />
If Hannah could put a word to the body language and look on the fawn's face, she'd use, <br />
'timid.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, everyone, this is Spike.&quot; Jenny said taking the fawn her arms and raising him to <br />
eye level with the does. &quot;My fawn.&quot; <br />
<br />
Su Yin showed no reaction, &quot;Interesting.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lateisha didn't say anything, she just calm took two steps back from the former buck... <br />
just to be on the safe side of course. <br />
<br />
For his part, Spike looked as terrible as a sunday afternoon. There were his mommy's <br />
friends, so he shouldn't have anything to be worried about, right? <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Maggie was a shrewd woman, but she wasn't naive, but at the same time, she wasn't <br />
stupid either. She doubted that any company would try to feed her this load of hogwash if <br />
they weren't serious. Because she knew no one would ever take it seriously! In short, it was <br />
too absurd not to be true. <br />
<br />
So from what she gathered, her son was inside this place's resort, going around as a half-<br />
human wombat or something. And now he wanted to stay one! She knew he was often put <br />
down at collage... but when was the stupid boy going to learn to grow some backbone!? <br />
Life's problems didn't vanish because you hid from them! Which Maggie saw this exactly <br />
as! Time for the boy to be reminded that there was no hiding from real life! <br />
<br />
Maggie glowed beat red when she was forced to strip. She never had any attention of <br />
hitting the random button, not because she thought that maybe she'd end up male, but <br />
because she had no intention of ending up some half-sewer rat (which was an american <br />
animal) freak by accident.  However, if this was how those in control were going to play <br />
this game, then she'd beat them by it. <br />
<br />
Her choices were limited to American animals, logical given the park's motif. Maggie had <br />
never been ashamed of her body, nor did she consider herself a vain woman. But she knew <br />
she wasn't likely to get much sense back into her son's head if she chose to become <br />
something like a humanish field mouse! <br />
<br />
Thus, Maggie knew she had to pick carefully. Technically, Maggie's 'temporary pass' wasn't <br />
on the books, though ultimately, to avoid scandal, some of the higher ups may chose that <br />
it meant for her to stay as long as her son did. <br />
<br />
Maggie didn't know this at the time though, all she knew, she wanted something powerful, <br />
but at the same time wasn't plug ugly. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
It seemed almost everyone who was a resident of the park was there that night. Even <br />
huskies were there observing the show in the shadows. Okay, the turn out wasn't THAT <br />
big. But every fox in the park was decidedly there, along with their friends. Mike had <br />
successfully made a name for himself among the foxes as a capable leader.<br />
<br />
Su Yin was there for research purposes. The more see looked at the park, the more it <br />
reminded her of a MMORPG. The only real difference was that here you had the option of <br />
possibly taking over some of your pretend life after the gaming session was done into <br />
your real life. <br />
<br />
Laura acted as show woman and announcer. <br />
<br />
She made a point to talk with Hannah before the show started. &quot;I just want you to know <br />
Hannah, I haven't forgotten my promise, I'll be the human you need in the real world.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it true what I heard? That Jasmine and Mike are gonna try and get the park to agree to <br />
keep their bodies as is?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Haven't ask formally though yet. And I haven't heard of any of our kind who have <br />
gotten a yes from the humans yet.&quot; It felt odd for Laura to use humans in third person <br />
when she'd soon be one again. Heck, she hadn't thought about the fact they were all <br />
naked for over a month! Then again, as Su Yin would say, 'when a variable becomes a <br />
factor, there is no need to state 1=1.'  &quot;Don't worry Hannah, you asked me to be the <br />
human in the outside world who'd be your friend and I intend to keep that promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I didn't know your daughter was going to try and stay a vixen, are you sure you want <br />
that? To be a different species from your own child?&quot; Hannah knew better to even think the <br />
word 'husband.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah.&quot; Laura said sternly but calmly, &quot;I made a -promise-. And I intend to -keep- that <br />
promise. Do you remember my e-mail and street address?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then stop worrying about it! I'll see you when you get out. And don't you -dare- fret on <br />
me.&quot; <br />
<br />
The large chested doe merely nodded. &quot;Okay.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Laura smiled as best she could with a fox's muzzle and got up on the tree stump before <br />
the nocturnal visioned crowd, the stars providing good back drop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen.&quot; She called the best she could with her voice, &quot;I present to you, for <br />
the first and only time here at Transformation Park USA! The acrobatic pair Sage and <br />
Vixen!&quot; This had been on request by Mike and Jasmine. <br />
<br />
The log had been stripped of all moss and mold, no need to risk a broken neck anymore <br />
than they needed to.<br />
<br />
As a final note of the evening, before things got started Mike declared his successor as the <br />
leader of his gang of foxes, choosing a non-transgendered sage who was late twenties in <br />
real life and was supposedly a traffic cop. <br />
<br />
Many, of the vixens were quite sad to see Mike go, but rules were rules, and Mike politely <br />
asked them NOT to hold a protest to get him to stay longer. Thankfully none of them ask <br />
him to go feral. For Jasmine of course this just mean, he was all hers. And Laura, was <br />
dutifully impressed.<br />
<br />
Jenny sat at the back-row with Spike on her shoulders so he could see, doing her best not <br />
to attract attention to her fawn. <br />
<br />
Jeremy and Leticia of course got the front row, with Jackie and Keith sitting next to them. <br />
Jackie quickly found herself in higher regards somehow now she was carrying kittens. Not <br />
she cared in the least. She, and Keith, were still quite nervous about their litter, and <br />
hoping that nothing would go wrong. And that they'd be able to swing it in the real world <br />
with five kids at once. <br />
<br />
And so the show began. The foxes started off with some backflips, and handstands, <br />
continued by cartwheels and standing on each other's shoulders. It was fantastic how <br />
good the foxes had gotten in such a short time. Though they had had plenty of spare time <br />
to practice of course. <br />
<br />
The entire crowd was held in place, even without music to time everywhere. Even the <br />
huskies laxed in their duties slightly at the fantastic show. Nowhere near as dangerous or <br />
bloody as the buck tournament had been. This, was just beautiful. Truly, this was <br />
something no foxes in the wild would do. This was something only one with a human <br />
mind could ever hope to do. <br />
<br />
The show lasted a good hour, but it was over just too quickly for many, and it resulted in a <br />
few encores, which had the end result of Sage Fox and Vixen Fox being totally exhausted <br />
when they were finally allowed to bow out. <br />
<br />
Tired, but happy, and together.</p>
