<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Our episode title is also a Monkees song written by Mike Nesmith.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
The werecat and her weretiger were enjoying a lazy Sunday morning within their motel room, but they were far from idle.<br />
After a brief appearance at the annual Halloween dance, Marci and Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Green enjoyed a long romp in the woods.<br />
They had been a happily married couple since their walk down the aisle almost ten years ago now, but the one thing they had never been able to do was consummate their marriage beyond holding hands, hugs, and kisses; for she was also a white furred Turkish Angora werecat.<br />
When they first met, fell in love and tied the knot Ted, as he liked to be called–because Teddy sounded more like a kid&#39;s name–was a normal human being. Despite how much they wanted each other, had the two of them given into their passions and got sexual, he would have become a werecat too. This in and of itself wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but for some reason all werecats were either bi (like Marci) or outright gay.*<br />
Finally, the otherwise happy couple caught a break and Ted found himself on assignment in Moon Lake, a secret were sanctuary. In exchange for his help to protect the town&#39;s secrets, town chancellor Samantha Twist made arrangements for Ted to be with a weretigress named Lila Carpenter**.<br />
Now, thanks to that sexual encounter, Ted was a proud white furred Bengal weretiger and the Greens had been seriously making up for lost time ever since.<br />
Their &quot;long walk in the woods&quot; had only been as far to finding the first private spot available that wasn&#39;t being used by another horny were couple, and then they spent many long enjoyable hours rutting like teenagers who had just discovered what sex even was.<br />
Towards dawn, the couple realized they needed to get back to their hotel room before anyone spotted them, so snuck in the back way to avoid any and all prying eyes.<br />
However, sleep was the farthest thing on their mind, until sheer sexual exhaustion overtook them.<br />
<br />
Now, as the day turned to afternoon, Ted Green woke up to a well familiar sight, staring deeply into his wife&#39;s feline eyes.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asked, as his feline orbs met hers.<br />
&quot;Just taking in how handsome my husband is,&quot; said Marci with a smile on her muzzle, before she playfully rubbed her nose against his.<br />
&quot;Odd. You still look as beautiful to me now as the day we first met,&quot; replied Ted, before the nose rubbing turned into kissing.<br />
Soon the couple wasn&#39;t sure where one of them ended and the other began as they lovingly embraced each other.<br />
&quot;I want to ask you something,&quot; they said, almost in perfect unison.<br />
Marci giggled and Ted smiled, before saying &quot;You first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Marci. &quot;Did you mean what you said about moving permanently to Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, basking in the feeling of her furry body rubbing against his pelt. &quot;It might take up to another year or two after we go back to Washington after our vacation ends, and will depend upon when an opening occurs in the Seattle office, but I can&#39;t see why not. Besides, depending upon who wins the Presidential election next year, neither of us might not want to stay in DC anyway.***&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Marci, a bit sad at the prospect of leaving, &quot;but relocating will open up a whole new world for us here,&quot; she added joyfully, while nuzzling up against her husband.<br />
&quot;My turn now. Do you want to have children now? Our children?&quot; wondered Ted.<br />
&quot;Yes, my foolish husband. I may be a bi-werecat, but in my case that only means I&#39;m like a bee that wants some honey occasionally. You&#39;re the only man I love, so this is the only thing I ever want to make me pregnant,&quot; said Marci, while reaching down to caress his very hard weretiger penis. &quot;I&#39;ve stopped taking my werecat birth control pills. Granted, they do take a couple of days to clear out of a woman&#39;s system, but by the end of this vacation, I should be carrying our first cub, if not sooner, considering the way we&#39;ve been going at it since you gained a fur coat,&quot; explained Marci, before kissing him again.<br />
&quot;Our cub,&quot; repeated Teddy.<br />
&quot;Yes. Although we&#39;re a mixed feline couple, cubs does sound better than kittens.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Ted, trying to clear his head. &quot;It&#39;s just that we&#39;ve talked about starting a family for so long, now that the dream is finally coming true...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know dearest,&quot; said Marci, as she started playfully running a paw up and down his furry chest. &quot;But it&#39;s about time, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; growled her husband, before flipping them over so that Marci was now on her back and he was on top.<br />
<br />
But before Ted Green could complete the deed, there was a knock on their motel room door.<br />
&quot;Not expecting anyone, are you?&quot; he whispered, to which Marci shook her head negatively.<br />
Reluctantly getting up, FBI agent training took over as Theodore Green approached the door at an angle so that he wasn&#39;t directly in front of it.<br />
&quot;Who is it?&quot; he called out.<br />
&quot;Lila Carpenter. I brought lunch,&quot; came the reply.<br />
Ted turned to look at his wife. Marci just shrugged her shoulders and nodded her head that he should let their visitor in. Although grateful to the lady as their benefactor, Lila Carpenter had made it quite clear that she wouldn&#39;t mind an encore–or more–with Ted and/or Marci.<br />
&quot;Hi. You look as handsome as ever,&quot; said Lila, walking into the room carrying two pizza boxes and assorted goodies. &quot;Figured you guys would be hungry. Moe&#39;s Pizza has this meat lover&#39;s special that just about every were in Moon Lake swears by,&quot; she added, as Ted closed the hotel room door behind her.<br />
&quot;Hmm... doesn&#39;t take a genius to guess what you two have been up to,&quot; said Lila with a smile as she sniffed the air. Despite the fact she was currently in her human form, her weretigress senses were as acute as ever.<br />
&quot;You know, as much as I love you <i>au naturel,</i>&quot; said Lila, while looking over his new fursona with more than a passing interest since she was the one who initiated him into were society, &quot;Marci really should take you to Awareness before you guys have to get back to DC.&quot;<br />
&quot;Awareness?&quot; asked Ted.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a clothing store here in town that especially caters to weres,&quot; explained Lila.<br />
&quot;Samantha told me about it. I was planning to take him tomorrow,&quot; replied Marci, getting up to take a better sniff of the pizza aroma coming from the boxes.<br />
&quot;Good. Now, I&#39;m sure you two have worked up a serious appetite, so dig in,&quot; said Lila, while grabbing a slice for herself. <i>And I certainly know what I want for desert!</i> she silently added, while eyeing both Marci and Ted Green.<br />
______________________________________________________________________<br />
*True, male werecats are more commonly known as wildcats, but considering Marci didn&#39;t spend her entire life in a were community like Moon Lake, she isn&#39;t as knowledgeable on this as she could have been.<br />
**This is the single and bi Earth 1 version of the character. The Earth 2 version is straight, happily married to Lance Knight, and pregnant with their first cub.<br />
