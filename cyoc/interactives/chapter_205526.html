<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were in utter disbelief with this news. Heck like allot of young women as a child you often had fantasies of being a mermaid, just that as bad luck would have it your parents started your swimming lessons late and before you could fully get into the typical these days Mermaiding activities your time was instead spent on your studies. Yet this news was both impossibly lucky and heart-warming you just had to try it right...<br />
<br />
...“It’d like to be a child mermaid” You announce to the worker. “You look unusually young to be wanting to go that route? Not that we oppose it” the worker responded “Still want age range should I expect as once transformed you need to fully revert which usually requires being transformed for about an hour before changing ages”. “Would 8 do?” You guessed. “Well your choice and I was thinking more along betweens. Like 0-5, 6-11, 12-16... basically development milestone ages if you know what I mean” the worker assured while handing you a bag “Also I should say that before I let you go for ages under 17 experiencers  are assigned parents from the adult long-term merfolk and we mean both natural and reverts like yourself”. “Alright... don’t really mind” you assure before noticing “What’s the bag for?”. “Storing your belongings among this alcove just before the spot where you’ll transform. Just need your name signed here on the register and on the bag” the worker explained “By the way I should warn you. Regardless of age all merfolk are always nude”. “I easily guessed that from the lagoon outside and by now alright with it” You assured the worker.<br />
<br />
After going down the required path you easily found the alcove where guests like you needed to safely place their storage bags holding their stuff during the experience, and then headed further down the tunnel. As you walked it seemed like everything was getting bigger and the moonpool entrance to the Lagoon getting further and further away while the weight of your breasts on your chest was getting lighter. After finally reaching the water you looked at your reflection and saw why as you had de-aged on the way. Now you were 8 again like you had been thinking of though in a proportional way to your now former age, your hair even still being chin length and somewhat messy.<br />
<br />
You were then suddenly brought out of your gazing as this mermaid, mid-30s in age you were guessing with long and flowing raven hair and silver-scaled tail and breasts seemingly of D size emerging from the moonpool and getting seated on the edge “Oh... dear you’re so cute” she greeted “I’m Doria by the way. Assigned to be your single mother”. “Oh...umm... Nice to meet you” You returned. “Likewise. Now dear to start we need to take hands while you get seated” Doria returned kindly “Oh I forgot? What’s your name?”. “Alexia” You answered. “As a human. As my mermaid daughter you will be Meri” Doria responded with a chuckle. “Oh... alright” You accept as you got seated next to Doria and took her hand.<br />
<br />
The moment your hands were held the actual transformation started. Your legs were pulled together with your skin and muscles merging to turn them into a single tail. Your toes, all left from your feet following started extending to great lengths and splitting into branches. Silver scales then started popping up all over everything below your stomach while a membrane formed between the branches to create a powerful tailfin for powerful swimming. Otherwise besides your lungs reformatting to breath both air and water and your eyes whites turning light-blue, same you soon noticed Doria had in place of her eyes’ whites in her beautiful browns, nothing changed upon your upper body. “There a reason I got the same tail as you mum?” You asked Doria almost as naturally as if she really was your mother. “Well we are mother and daughter. Children usually need to share one tail or another with a parent” Doria kindly assured as she re-entered the water while still holding your hand “Now then Meri. I do say it’s time we left and joined in with everyone”. Without a word you happily followed her and both swam out into the lagoon.<br />
<br />
Before you knew it you were now in the depths of the Lagoon with Doria, your mother, well at least for now, and partaking in the various activities besides swimming. Such as a tail variation of kickball with some other Merkids, some you guessed could be fellow guests undergoing the experience and if so which ones were really adults. Racing with the Merkids as well at time. Doria even took you to the Lagoon side of not just the viewing glass towards the experience but to other, more normal viewing found in aquariums or water-show stages and showing off to the other guests. You even at one point pressed up to the glass to playfully cross-hands with a pair of twins, one a boy the other a girl. Their parents unopposed to yours or the others nudity, apparently it might be common knowledge besides you already that merfolk were naturally nude.<br />
<br />
As you soon got hungry Doria took you to a place within the lagoon to eat and you were amazed at how varied merfolk cuisine was with various kinds of small fish, oysters and seaweed meals there were. What’s more the changes it seems to you included a vast liking to these raw meals. Regardless you were having so much fun it took you back when you noticed the lagoon was getting darker with the sun setting above. “My you are an adorable child Meri” Doria happily remarked. “Yeah but... it’s getting late mum. I need to be going” You sadly confess. “Not so. There are still many things untouched by your cute hands” Doria argued kindly “Besides what’s the matter of an ‘overnight’ stay”. “I guess...” You nervously agreed. “So... I have an idea” Doria then started:</p>
