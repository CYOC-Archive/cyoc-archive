<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Ty made it through the front door Dustin was there demanding to be returned to normal. &quot;Make me older Ty or I will make you pay! I know you broke all those kid&#39;s legs and I am not afraid to tell the government, mom and dad, or even the internet. So make me older and we can deal with this together, or else your whole world will come crashing down around you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dustin was quite intimidating even with a 13 year old body, but Ty had other things to worry about like Mark, the kids he accidentally crippled, his foster sister, the history exam, and trying to figure out if there was a moral imperative to revert June. Oh yeah, and he did something to his body that nobody noticed but him, and all the other accidental changes were obvious to others, why is that? Ty floated past Dustin without responding or even looking...<br />
<br />
Ty went up to his room and dropped his stuff off. He went to the bathroom he and Dustin shared and noticed shaving supplies were neatly in the corner. Since Mark didn&#39;t use that bathroom and Dustin didn&#39;t need to shave anymore, he assumed they were his. He looked in the mirror and as expected he had the beginnings of a beard. Although he liked it, it looked really awkward on his face, it would probably look good when he was 20... but not with his late bloomer facial structure... *sigh* &quot;I wish I had the beard growth my body would have naturally and people remembered it this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty used the bathroom and then went into his room to do homework. He got through everything as Mark came home from work. &quot;TY! Come down here!&quot; Mark bellowed.<br />
<br />
Ty immediately realized that he started his homework before doing chores which is a big mistake in this house. &quot;Yes, Mark?&quot; Ty said timidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;USE YOUR VOICE WHEN YOU ADDRESS ME! The garbage isn&#39;t taken out, the dishes are not cleaned and put away, the table is not set for dinner, and you still have not cleaned the gutters as you were asked to do last Wednesday!&quot; He paused waiting for Ty to formulate a response. Ty had learned long ago that explaining circumstances, even completely rational and valid ones, will only make the punishment worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;You stupid, good for nothing, ingrate. You probably don&#39;t even realize you&#39;re grounded now. And drivers ed next semester? Don&#39;t you be thinking we would sign off on that. Driving is a big responsibility and frankly I don&#39;t think you have what it takes. Maybe when you&#39;re 17 or more likely when you&#39;re 20.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then June walked in with both arms full of groceries and a smile. &quot;Why hello!&quot; she greeted everyone warmly. &quot;Would you mind giving me a hand?&quot; which was in jarring contrast to her usual passive aggressive self depreciating guilt trips. They would usually sound like, &quot;Well I guess I&#39;ll do it by myself because nobody cares what I do for this family unless it doesn&#39;t happen. I just can&#39;t win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark immediately turned to Ty, &quot;Hey stupid, help your mother.&quot; Ty, bolted for the door to help as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Ty grabbed a bag of groceries and ran back inside where chaos had ensued... the new and wonderfully improved June couldn&#39;t stand for Mark being verbally and emotionally abusive to the children. Normal old Mark couldn&#39;t handle being challenged in &quot;his own&quot; house, and Dustin who Ty had forgotten about while dealing with the other things going on, was ranting about posting about Ty on CNN, Fox, and CBS as well as every other news and social media sight.<br />
<br />
Ty came in setting the groceries down and although he tried to stay calm, he couldn&#39;t. There was a high pitched ringing and a sudden compression of the air. Voices became muffled like on an airplane or underwater. That didn&#39;t stop the yelling or even slow it down for more than a second or two. Everyone had their points to make and they would fight tooth and nail to be heard.<br />
<br />
Ty was tired of it, and angry, and hurt. June is now fundamentally wonderful and he is the only one who notices... everyone else is too broken.  Ty didn&#39;t know what he was going to do but something was going to happen. Though unseen, the air around Ty was beginning to spiral like a tornado. &quot;June, go take a nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fired up expression on June&#39;s face immediately fell to emotionless and she walked across the living room and up the stairs. Her movement however, was straight out of a horror film. She moved at 4 times normal speed without running until the final three steps when she reverted back to normal.<br />
<br />
Dustin started screaming, &quot;See Dad!, See, I told you! Dad! He&#39;s evil!&quot; Ty&#39;s glare immediately paralyzed him, both muting him and making it so he cannot run away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on Ty? You are grounded till you&#39;re 25, you don&#39;t get to tell your mother what to do!&quot; Mark clambered unable to grasp how out of control he was. The roll of paper towels, fastened above the sink began to unroll as it got pulled into they vortex around Ty. The towels shredded themselves into smaller and smaller pieces and spontaneously incinerated into ash.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are poison.&quot; Ty whispered with a hatred he never dared allow himself to feel. The windows suddenly shattered inward and the wind roared. In both Mark and Dustin&#39;s head a voice echoed what Ty said. Both winced but found they couldn&#39;t move their lower bodies. <br />
<br />
In the same super fast movement June had made, Mark found Ty&#39;s hand on his chest and he was lifted off the ground and transported to the living room. When Mark&#39;s senses returned he realized he was sitting on the couch. Ty whispered, &quot;You&#39;ve done so much, consider yourself as having earned some early retirement and relieved of your responsibilities.&quot; Wave after wave of heaviness washed over him until he could no longer focus on anything or move himself. A young boy in front of him reached back and snapped his fingers. Wheel of fortune came on, Mark smiled. He likes wheel of fortune.<br />
<br />
Dustin watched helplessly as Ty pinned his father to the couch. Though Dustin couldn&#39;t move his feet he was able to pivot and watch what was happening in the living room. It took several seconds but Dustin eventually recognized the surreal scene before him. His Dad who was heavy set and muscular, in his early 40&#39;s, was wasting away before his eyes. First, the formidable man appeared to become emaciated. Pound after pound of muscle and fat seemed to simply evaporate. Then the skin on the skeletal form seemed to age and sag as the color appeared to be sucked out from the tip of each strand of hair leaving a frail and nearly unrecognizable shell, Finally the light in his dad&#39;s eyes seemed to dim and go out. Dustin watched as Ty somehow willed the TV to turn on and his fathers attention was glued to it as though nothing else mattered.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s gaze fell back on mute, demasculated Dustin and he silently screamed in terror for his mommy or anyone to save him. It felt as though a bubble had popped inside his head and Dustin suddenly felt serene. Ty stood inches away and yet they were now face to face, Dustin realized he was floating but even that didn&#39;t shake the serenity overwhelming him. He realized he had peed his pants and knew full well why, but couldn&#39;t bring himself to panic, scream, fight or resist... he couldn&#39;t even make himself want to fight though he knew he should and he knew he was in mortal danger. <br />
<br />
&quot;You exposed me?&quot; Ty asked. He asked it in a normal voice but even at a few inches away it was hard to hear. It was followed up with the same roar of the wind and mental echo.<br />
<br />
Dustin knew he should be begging but couldn&#39;t bring himself to say anything more than. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you had to spend three days underdeveloped?&quot; Ty asked calmly, nearly emotionless, but the wind raged and the psychic voice screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were threatening a fourth.&quot; Dustin said calmly knowing that was the wrong answer, but unable to stop himself.<br />
<br />
The wind died suddenly and it was disturbing. The only noise the TV saying &quot;Spin that Wheel!&quot; with the audience applauding and Mark, now an invalid, grunting approval at the spinning colors. The shards of shattered glass where reassembling back into windows and though Dustin couldn&#39;t see it, paper towels and  bag so groceries were unburning and reassembling.<br />
<br />
Ty, now audible and without a weird psychic echo or wind, asked, &quot;Why do you hate me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin never asked himself that question and didn&#39;t think of himself as hating anyone but boy bands. &quot;Because you got all their attention. Yes it was negative, but it was also all the attention they gave.&quot; he answered involuntarily. As soon as he said it he knew it was true. Horror washed over him, not for what would happen to him, but for the first time he realized how horrible he had been. &quot;Oh my God, Ty, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; being able to speak freely for the first time since he was talking to his Dad.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at him, &quot;Don&#39;t worry Dustin, I forgive you, and you will make it up to me.&quot; Ty put his hand on Dustin&#39;s chest and energy poured into Dustin changing him.<br />
<br />
Mentally Ty and Dustin were having a conversation, while the changes were happening physically. Like before the questions were loaded and Dustin couldn&#39;t lie, speak out of turn or mitigate his answers in any way even though he knew his answers were being used against him in a terrible way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just wanted to be older right Dustin? More mature? Beefy and Sexy, right? Able to bring home a different girl every time you go out?&quot; Ty cooed seductively.<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Dustin agreed knowing he was somehow digging himself into a hole. Ty&#39;s hand on his chest seemed to be shrinking not that he really noticed.<br />
&quot;You thought about it haven&#39;t you? Being the man of the house, holding down the job, your father relying on you for support, being powerless against your will?&quot; Ty led.<br />
It didn&#39;t quite seem right but Dustin was swept away by the physical, emotional, and intellectual changes. &quot;Yes, yes, give it to me.&quot; <br />
&quot;Done&quot; Ty said<br />
<br />
Dustin blinked and looked around, everything seemed familiar yet strange. Dad was watching wheel of fortune and he was getting a hug from his little brother Ty. He looked at his watch, &quot;8:15, shit!&quot; he needs to get to bed or he will be tired for his 2am shift!<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Night Dustin! I don&#39;t tell you this enough but thanks for being June&#39;s and my Guardian!&quot; Ty said <br />
<br />
The nearly musclebound 26 year old smiled wearily, &quot;I love you too bro but I gotta sleep now.&quot; <br />
<br />
In this new history, Mark took on Ty 10 years ago and then was struck with a slow and progressive form of Dementia making him nearly comatose as long as the TV is on. June is now only two years older than Ty and their sister, and Dustin is 11 years older than Ty. When Mark began to lose his faculties, Dustin being 18 at the time, stepped up and took over household affairs. Everyone does what they can and things are peaceful and full of love. <br />
<br />
Dustin is strong, young, undeniably handsome, and dumb as a box of rocks. Ty and June run the house, Dustin works two manual labor jobs bringing in ample funds but doesn&#39;t understand the finances. He gets drunk every Friday afternoon (its night to him and his cheat day) and comes home with some chick, the only thing that can keep him awake past 8pm given his schedule it&#39;s physical demands. Ty sterilized Dustin and made him immune to STDs because Dustin felt true remorse for how he treated Ty. This is the most fulfilling life that Mark and Dustin can have in their current state.<br />
<br />
Dustin went into the master bedroom which is now his room and fell asleep almost immediately. Ty having released his rage and having no conscious, cognizant person around, began to cry and felt confused about what he should do.</p>
