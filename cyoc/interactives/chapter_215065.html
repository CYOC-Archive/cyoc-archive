<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After satisfying their neighbor sexually on the sidewalk, Jeff and Sarah accompanied Linda, who had put her pants in her purse and was still naked, until they said goodbye in front of her house. After saying goodbye, she entered her own house and Jeff followed with his sister a few more meters and they arrived at their own residence.<br />
<br />
Once they entered the house and found their mother, Jeff realized that she had gone through a change while he was gone, as she now had two heads. By the way she acted, Jeff could tell that she wasn&#39;t aware of the change, but judging by her reaction, Sarah was aware of this particular change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God.  Mom, how did this happen to you?&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; their mother&#39;s right head asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your head.  How did you grow an extra head while I was gone?&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny.  You know I was born with two heads.&quot; their mother&#39;s left head said<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t born with two heads, you only had one when I went after Jeff.&quot; Sarah said and turned to Jeff, asking him to confirm what she said, with a look of someone who didn&#39;t know what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting confused Sarah, I&#39;m not seeing anything different about Mom.&quot; Jeff said, pretending he didn&#39;t know and following the reality that had been altered, pointing to an old family photo in which their mother already appeared with two heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now enough talk.  Jeff and Sarah, come eat before breakfast gets cold.&quot; their mother right head said<br />
<br />
Jeff sat down to eat his breakfast and felt an excess of softness on his ass and wet spots on his pants.  Getting up again to see what it was, he felt his ass and found that he himself had undergone a change, his buttocks had swelled to become a very large pair of breasts, and the wet spots on his pants were where it&#39;s nipples, because milk was leaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget to milk your breasts again Jeff?&quot; Sarah asked<br />
<br />
Knowing that no one was aware of the change Jeff just agreed saying that he really had forgotten.<br />
<br />
His mother then took a tray and put his breakfast, and also had another different breakfast plate, which consisted more of fish, so she said to Jeff &quot;Go get your dad breakfast, she&#39;ll be up late by now and she&#39;ll want to help you with your breasts.  You can have your breakfast with her in the meantime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took the tray and went upstairs, noticing that his mother addressed his father in the feminine, which made him think that some change had taken place with his father, and it was exactly as he imagined. Arriving in what was originally his parents&#39; bedroom, Jeff found that the room was now at least twice the size of before, as well as the ceiling was higher, and half of this space was taken up by a large aquarium in which a shemale mermaid was swimming.<br />
<br />
There was a ladder to climb on a platform beside the aquarium, and the mermaid swam to it, leaning over the edge and thanking Jeff for breakfast.<br />
<br />
Jeff explained the situation with his breasts and his mermaid &#39;father&#39; helped him, squeezing his breasts until the last drop of milk came out. After the problem was solved and breakfast consumed, Jeff said he needed to hurry so he wouldn&#39;t miss school, but he ended up discovering that there was one more change that affected everyone.  He discovered that schools no longer existed, now children learned the basics directly from their parents and could start to follow any profession that interested them, not working but learning by seeing others working.<br />
<br />
Not having to go to school, Jeff went to his room and decided to do a little research to see how the world was changing, if there were reports of people aware of the changes commenting on what happened. On the way to his bedroom he heard a groan from Sarah&#39;s room with the door open, so he looked over and saw that she was lying on her bed naked and doing more than one thing at the same time.<br />
<br />
Sarah was talking to a friend on the phone, where she was talking about her mother growing a second head and somehow no one knew about it, while at the same time she didn&#39;t seem to notice that she herself had gone through a new change and was making use of such.  Jeff&#39;s sister now had her body splitting at chest level and with that now she had two bottom halves, one in front of the other, and the space between each pair of her legs was hermaphrodite, having a dick and a pussy, but she had no balls, and while talking she pushed her rear lower half, fucking the pussy of her front lowert half.</p>
