<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan ended the transformation - deciding that Jerry had gotten young enough already. The rest of the day he was keen to enjoy his new station now that he&#39;d regressed Jerry down to one of their intern staff. He was now the senior manager - which almost didn&#39;t feel real with how he&#39;d dealt with Jerry not too long before - and tomorrow he&#39;d likely see Jerry in a vastly different context. By the time he&#39;d gone to sleep, Ethan had dressed for the gym, gone to workout, and enjoyed a more substantial set of meals due to the higher pay from his new job. Plus, it seemed like people on average respected him more.<br />
<br />
Before stripping for bed, Ethan contemplated what kind of transformations he might indulge in the next day. Because he was certainly going to be playing a little bit of &quot;Bring The Chronivac To Work&quot; Day. He contemplated leaning out his stomach a bit - but he figured that his current look was fine. Working on it would be fine, but he didn&#39;t want to just immediately change anything and everything. That might prove to have consequences on his work ethic.<br />
<br />
Before going to sleep, Ethan played over the transformation he&#39;d induced in Jerry in his head. Admittedly, it got him pretty strongly aroused. He felt pleased that his libido was still so strong going into his thirties. It meant he would still be able to go forth and conquer so to speak possibly even into his forties...<br />
<br />
Things to contemplate for later.<br />
<br />
By the time of the next morning, Ethan groggily got out of bed and stretched. He wished he could just go to work clad as he was, but he doubted even the Chronivac could let him do that. He headed off into the bathroom, shaved off the night&#39;s stubble and beard growth, and then headed to the kitchen. He picked out his usual breakfast, letting out one more yawn as he awaited coffee set in the machine. As Ethan ate, he thought about the other folks at the job.<br />
<br />
There was of course the vivacious woman that Jerry had ended up with, daughter of one of the higher up execs. The idea of a three way with her and the thin, excitable young intern proved to be a surprisingly enticing one. Show Jerry - now a newbie at the company - how a man fucks. He bit his lip and managed to keep himself from any activity at the table - after all, it wouldn&#39;t do to make any mess right where he ate.<br />
<br />
He remembered that he had not yet ended the transformation on himself yet. He could pound out some push ups here, see how things might get in a few more years...but he decided against it at least for now. <br />
<br />
Once he was done eating, Ethan begrudgingly slipped on his day&#39;s best. His button up shirt was tighter on him than usual, and his dress pants were much more flattering on his ass. It almost looked pornographic, the way that he seemed to look dressed as he was. It somewhat reminded him of dear old Jerry, the Jerry he could still recall vaguely. From how things were. Maybe these reality rewrites needed to be done with some degree of care. Because this was a pretty strong effect.<br />
<br />
He made sure to grab his Chronivac equipped laptop, figuring he could utilize his newly roomy office to his advantage in as far as any transformations he felt like inducing. <br />
<br />
He headed out - his neighbor of course offering him a flirtatious morning greeting, reminding him again that he really should try and get with that woman sooner rather than later. He couldn&#39;t very well let the ahem &quot;new intern&quot; get all the action. Maybe even use the same style of transformation when the two of them hooked up - some sort of transformation induced with every thrust of his dick.<br />
<br />
As Ethan drove to work, he found himself thinking about the new circumstances. Due to the changes induced by his reality alteration on good old Jerry, Ethan was now the head manager, and though he still maintained his presence coding and being involved in product streamlining, he was now finding himself remembering a vastly more stimulating and intensive job environment, coordinating people and projects to make sure things got done well ahead of schedule. <br />
<br />
If he played his cards right in this new state of things, he might even get to acquire a promotion - and possibly through that get to work from home most of the time. Meaning the only time he&#39;d need to be properly dressed would be during zoom calls.<br />
<br />
As Ethan got to his job and entered the front door, he found himself evaluating the interns currently running about doing their usual tasks. There was Jerry - lean, young and fresh-faced Jerry. Just getting done delivering someone&#39;s paperwork to the right location. &quot;Hey, Jerr,&quot; Ethan shouted, &quot;Can I get a coffee and the reports from last week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing boss!&quot; Jerry just about stumbled over himself as he set about doing that. <br />
<br />
But it was what he saw going on that got him pretty interested. Even though Jerry was fresh, boyish, and not all that brawny now, it was clear that among the interns at least they liked him. The other interns included Sarah, a young red headed woman working mostly on a computer handling badges and check in data, and apparently the bookish and shy girl thought nobody would notice her staring right at Jerry&#39;s butt as the guy hurried along.<br />
<br />
There was also Lindsey, a rather ditzy delivery girl who largely handled sending relevant information between departments in the building. She was quite a beautiful young woman in her college years, and when Ethan walked past her he heard her mumbling to herself about how she wanted to ask Jerry out.<br />
<br />
<i>Mm, maybe I should encourage this.</i><br />
<br />
Once Ethan got to his office, setting his Chronivac Laptop down at his side as he turned on his work computer, he knew it was just a matter of time before Jerry returned with his coffee and the reports. Meaning he could see how the young guy handled these things. Ethan kicked his legs as he settled into his desk and swivel chair - it was good to be the boss for a change as opposed to the floor guy. With the privacy involved, Ethan - for his own personal comfort - decided to unbutton about three buttons on his shirt. Let his chest show a bit more.<br />
<br />
He plugged the Chronivac Laptop in and got it started, considering what to do from here. He&#39;d already turned Jerry from the brawny manager into the lanky young intern... His contemplation ended however when Jerry entered with a cup of steaming hot coffee, and the relevant reports. He smiled broadly and stated in a tone obviously intended to be effacing, &quot;Hey boss, brought you the reports and your coffee as you asked! Always glad to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s what I like about you Jerry. Always eager to please.&quot; Ethan said that standard &quot;good job&quot; line, but then gestured for Jerry to come over.<br />
<br />
As the young man looked around a little first and then did so, Ethan stated, &quot;You&#39;re quite a popular guy around here, Jerry. Both Sarah and Lindsey both wanna have some time with you. How&#39;s that make you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jerry blushed a bright red, tugging at his shirt a little bit as he thought about how he&#39;d never really noticed before this, &quot;I---I uh...I uh. Never noticed---never thought---wow! Wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want my advice on this, you go for it. When people are interested that much in you, it&#39;s never a bad thing to increase your connections, as it were.&quot; Ethan winked a little bit, clearly alluding to an innuendo that Jerry obviously picked up on. If anything, the young intern seemed to get a little more heated up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I---yeah! Yeah! Thanks for letting me know, boss. I&#39;ll make sure that I don&#39;t let them down.&quot; Funny that Jerry even now was proving so readily popular. Now however it was less for his brawny and capable looks, however - it was for his bright, wide eyed and &quot;Boy Next Door&quot; charm. If Ethan knew anything about how these things worked, he knew there&#39;d probably be no time wasted on the first date before those interns got to sloppily humping each other.<br />
<br />
And that brought Ethan&#39;s attention to his Chronivac Laptop.<br />
<br />
He loaded up Jerry&#39;s profile, looking at the form of the young impressionable intern displayed there for him to see. Tapping his chin, Ethan contemplated. &quot;Let&#39;s see what I can do with you now, Jerr...&quot; He went ahead and decided to make sure that the fun happened - he clicked over to change Jerry&#39;s libido. It was already at a pretty reliably high number, but he wanted to be sure.<br />
<br />
So for now, Ethan ticked up Jerry&#39;s libido even further, and decreased his refractory period significantly. Now, it wouldn&#39;t take much to get the intern hot under the collar - and once he got done once, it wouldn&#39;t take long for him to recharge as it were. Ethan clicked off the reality change effect - he had felt a sense of wariness about applying that too often.<br />
<br />
Now he&#39;d be able to enjoy watching the intern deal with whatever change Ethan wanted inflicted with full awareness. It could be fun to watch him react to whatever happens. Maintain his mind even as his body went haywire.<br />
<br />
Ethan set up a rather lewd situation for the intern. He knew he&#39;d set Jerry up with quite a romantic evening depending on which of his fellow interns he went with. So every time Jerry achieved that tantalizing orgasm he&#39;d probably be so eager to chase...</p>
