<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought about what to turn his father into. He had always been into redheads, so that’s what he decided on. He went onto the Chronivac and started typing in the details.<br />

<br />
Satisfied with his fathers profile, Jeff pressed the “start transformation” button, a timer appeared and started counting down from 1:00:00, 0:59:59. <br />
<br />
Jeff walked downstairs and saw his father sitting on the couch watching Football. “Oh there you are son, just in time for kickoff,” his father said. “Oh sorry, I was just studying,” Jeff said awkwardly.  Jeff studied his father before the changes became active. He was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, trying to look casual after working. <br />
<br />
Jeff sat down next to his father and pretended to be invested in the game. Ten minutes later, he saw the first change. His father’s skin had become clearer, his hair had become fuller, and he had become younger, about late 30s or so. John looked at his son, confused as to why his son was staring at him. <br />
<br />
Some time later, Jeff looked at his father again. His stomach was flatter, and his hair was longer, slowly changing from black and grey to a beautiful shade of red. <br />
<br />
Halftime hit and John got up from his couch. Jeff looked at his fathers changing body, his butt had begun to slightly expand, and his t-shirt was slowly becoming smaller. His shorts slowly becoming longer and tighter. His hair had become longer and flowing on the bottom near the middle of his back. His body hair was receding back into his body. John walked over to the fridge, and grabbed two bottles of Pepsi for him and his son.<br />
<br />
John walked back to the couch. Jeff observed that his father’s body was a lot more feminine now. His face now had makeup on, and his face was starting to show feminine features. <br />
<br />
The game resumed, and the two continued to watch the game. When the 4th quarter began, Jeff looked at his father again. His t-shirt had fully became a crop top, exposing his now flat tummy. His pants had become long, black leggings that showed off his new bottom very well. He now had small converse sneakers on, which were very pink and feminine. But most importantly, he now had two small mounds protruding from his chest. <br />
<br />
John began to squirm as his underwear became very uncomfortable. He quickly readjusted it so it wouldn’t be uncomfortable against his slowly dwindling penis and testicles. <br />
<br />
With only 10 minutes to go, Jeff looked over to see if anything had changed. His father was quietly humming to himself. His voice had gone up about an octave and a major third. His waist was taken an hourglass figure, and he now looked like a very masculine twenty-something woman.  <br />
<br />
5 minutes had passed, and John’s penis and testicles had been sucked into his body, forming a cute little clitoris and vagina. He now looked like a young woman. <br />
<br />
2 minutes later, the mental changes started to kick in. John didn’t think of himself as Jeff’s father, but his girlfriend Jenna. Jeff began to think of himself as Jenna’s boyfriend. The two began to get closer as Jenna placed her head on Jeff’s chest. Jeff looked at her and noticed that his father was pretty much gone, replaced by Jenna and her beautiful feminine features. <br />
<br />
She had long, flowing red hair that went down to her butt. She had a cute little nose, full lips and her eyes had become a lighter blue. She had become a little bit shorter, only hitting 5’4. She had a gorgeous hourglass figure showing off her C Cup Breasts well. She was wearing a blue crop top that showed off her flat tummy and had long black leggings that showed off her legs and ass perfectly. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac was filling it’s progression bar and below it was a timer with a countdown. 0:00:03, 0:00:02, 0:00:01, 0:00:00... Transformation Complete. <br />
<br />
Jenna looked up at her lovely boyfriend and planted her lips on his. Jeff returned the passionate kiss. “That was a fun game, babe,” Jenna said. The lovely couple cuddled and fell asleep in each other’s arms.</p>
