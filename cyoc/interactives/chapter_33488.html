<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as Jenny was shocked at Spike's declaration to be a feral, the husky's response was even more stunning. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jenny asked surprised, &quot;I thought the feral option was open to -all- guests!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Spike is an exception,&quot; Naomi said, she never was known for sugar coating it, &quot;He's a threat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My fawn is not a threat!&quot; Jenny snapped at her. Truth was, Jenny was astounded that Spike had already come to care for her that much, well, okay, so it's what she suspected, heck -knew- all along, but to finally hear it out in the open, made her heart leap.  &quot;You're the husky who introduced us right? Naomi you said your name was? How could you do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not doing anything, it's a decision by management.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then it was the wrong decision!&quot; As much as Jenny was unsure of Spike become unprotected by the huskies (this place could be dangerous for a child without such protection), she was wound-up  by the park apparently still considering her fawn to be 'evil.' Jenny grasped at straws. &quot;And wouldn't it be better to keep him in the park, with me, where you can keep an eye on him? Rather than out there, where he can tell the tabloids about you in a negative light?&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi started. But regained her composer.  &quot;My orders, are my -orders-!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Orders can be changed! If Spike is willing to live here without your protection! Then so am I!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You. Becoming feral. Won't change a damn thing about Spike's situation. He'll still leave when his time is up, be re-aged, and shipped back out, no questions asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spike wondered what water dams had to do with any of this. Jenny meanwhile couldn't stand the idea of her fawn being turned back into that cold hearted beast. <br />
<br />
With a fawn to think about, Jenny ignored her instincts telling her to fear the husky, and said firmly, &quot;No.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Naomi raised a non-existent eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;I said no. If you want to turn Spike back into what he was, you'll have to go through me first.&quot; <br />
<br />
Okay. Naomi had dealt with over-zeal predators, and some Vore fetish fans who saw a chance to live out their fantasies. But a scared and determined mother was a little too dangerous combination and neither of their times were up at this point anyway. &quot;I will... inform the Management of your feelings, but don't expect anything to change.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And don't expect me to let you near him until I know you aren't going to violate him.&quot; Jenny never took her eyes off Naomi. And Naomi saw in them a grim determination. <br />
<br />
'Nothing is easy, nothing is simply anymore.' Naomi internal moaned as she vanished back to where she had come from. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Weather Jeremy left the park after Marth beat him was Jeremy's business. After Marth kicked his antlers, he'd have Leticia/Larry back, and that's what actually mattered. Personally, if that bear witch was really Jeremy's mother, then either Jeremy was as screwed up as she was, or had a very good reason to stay as evolve animally possible away from her! <br />
<br />
This was so screwed up. She had come here for a vacation, a vacation! With Larry. And now she was being told her boyfriend had dropped her like a rock behind her back, and had gotten -herself- pregnant? Seriously, this was so screwed up! She had been curious about what these new species could do, and knew it would be an endless supply of jokes later when they talked about the vacation they spent as different genders. Heck, at the time, as an added bonus, she was sure they'd make a killing on the furry artist market with some snap shots of the other guests! <br />
<br />
Larry had loved her, or at least, Marth was pretty sure he had. Or had Larry really been more in love with his anime DVDs like his friends like her own friends had told her he was? Maria had made it a point to debunk, or flat out ignore these accusations. After all, Larry had been willing to ignore anime night on occasion just for her. She had also toned down her practical jokes at his request too. She still giggled when she thought of the time she had replaced his Aikra DVD with 'Hello Kitty Theater!'  <br />
<br />
So either her friends had been right from the start, and Larry had been superimposing Asuka, Rei, Usagi, Kasumi, etc, on her face all this time, or this park had screwed with his head. From what Marth had been told, Larry HAD only fallen for Jeremy after the tournament. As much as he LOATHED to admit that black furred bear had given him any useful information, it seem logical, that if he could beat Jeremy, that Larry would come back to his senses. <br />
<br />
Sadly, taking on Jeremy before Marth had learned how to properly use this body was suicide. And no doubt the loss would lock in Leticia's mind that Marth was an unworthy mate and that her current one was the best stock. <br />
<br />
And if she could snap Larry back to reality -without- helping along that giant she-bear, so much the better! Then they could finally enjoy their vacation.  And then a year later they could laugh off the nine months Leticia spent miserably pregnant!  . . . . <br />
<br />
If Leticia really was pregnant, than Marth wasn't sure what he could do about that. Marth, ( rightfully ), knew family had only a passing amount to do with genetics. So it wasn't a matter of the baby staying with it's 'rightful' father. Marth wondered if together they could support a child. Well, they'd HAVE to. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Go with white flowers, they'll stand out better with the fur, and make a better faux wedding dress.&quot; Katie groaned as she put her muzzle in her paws. Things in this park either moved at molasses, or faster than sound, with no happy medium. <br />
<br />
Naomi had stormed through, no one dared talk to her.  They had all been watching the monitors. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Su Yin looked at Hannah, who was sitting at the center of the stony mountain hill that was used as the meeting place of the accidently TG anthros. Hannah just stared at the park below, the wind blowing against her bare furred body.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're thinking it aren't you?&quot; Su Yin said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Hannah's voice was mono-tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you're not going to -stop- thinking are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're hoping, that Marth will be the one, after Leticia  -somehow- magically lets him down gently. That after losing his significant other, that he'll be eager to stay in the form he lost her in, and that he'll be eager to start a relationship with someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're hoping, that if they fight, Jeremy will break him, and you'll be there to pick up the pieces?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Hannah looked at the doe professor's impassive face. &quot;I'm hoping this is resolved without a repeat of Sam and Spike! I'm hoping that Marth -doesn't- have to make an enemy out of every deer in the park! I'm hoping Marth CAN find a happy life in his new form, and that I can be the one to share it with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know a thing about him. He's just the next buck who wasn't 2-D in his thinking that came out of the gene splicer. Get to know him. Fall in love with him first, THEN think about the rest. Look at Keith and Jackie... they weren't trying to fall in love, they just did. Don't try to skip to the ending, you'll regret it. Become his friend first, because I feeling he's going to damn need one soon enough!&quot;</p>
