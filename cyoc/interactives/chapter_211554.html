<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Are you okay?” Ryan asked, cocking his head.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded. “Sorry, just kinda out of it today.”<br />
<br />
“Man, I wish I was your age. Then I could try out for the real football team!” <br />
<br />
Interesting. Jeff considered the young Ryan Huff. Handsome and athletic at 14. What would Ryan look like if he were his age? Taking out his phone, Jeff looked over the stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Ryan Huff<br />
Age: 14<br />
Height: 5’9”<br />
Weight: 180 lbs (93% Muscle, 7% Fat)<br />
Hair: black<br />
Eyes: Amber<br />
Body hair: Light<br />
Facial hair: Light Stubble<br />
Sexual Orientation: Bisexual (Virgin)<br />
Mannerisms: Jock, Flirty, Masculine, Lonely<br />
Status: Single<br />
<br />
Bisexual, huh? Jeff smirked and shook his head. No wonder the guy was such an asshole to everyone. As far as Jeff knew, the guy was single at 45. Oh well. He adjusted Ryan Huff’s age to 16. Then he hit enter and watched the show.<br />
<br />
Ryan and he continued walking to the locker room. As they did, the young man grew older, bones creaking as his grew even taller, a few inches taller than Jeff. Muscles seemed to bulge and unfurl under his clothes. His legs bulked up, becoming heavy with muscle and incredibly defined. Even his ass plumped and rounded into a tight bubble of muscle. Two thick, pillowy pecs shoved themselves forward, distressing his shirt as it shifted into something tighter. Body hair began growing, a few chest hairs popping up over Ryan’s collar and thick sideburns growing in on his face.<br />
<br />
“Heh, just can’t keep your eyes off of me, huh?” Ryan asked, smirking at Jeff and bouncing a pec.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed and trying to ignore how hard his cock was getting. This was his old asshole teacher, no way would he pop a boner for him! And yet he couldn’t deny that the well-muscled jock. Jeff kept shooting glances over at Ryan before wincing in pain. Ryan pulled out his phone, waiting for Jeff’s response and tapped something into it.<br />
<br />
A strange pins-and needles sensation overcame Jeff. He stretched, feeling his muscles tense and relax soothingly, his back and joints popping. When he finished stretching, Jeff noticed that the straps on Jeff’s backpack had suddenly become painfully tight. He must have tightened the straps accidentally as they were now digging into his chest. Jeff readjusted the straps on his backpack so they weren’t cutting into his pecs while he admired his handiwork. His biceps flexed with the movement.<br />
<br />
“I told you to stop that a thousand times. You know I hate it when you get all flirty with me.” Jeff found himself saying and blinked. Man, his voice sounded awfully deep and rumbly. Was he getting sick? And when had he ever said something like that? He barely even knew Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Ha! It was a joke not a dick, don’t take it so hard. So…you gonna practice with me, Jeff?” Ryan asked as they hurried down the hall to the locker room.<br />
<br />
“Um, I’ll watch you practice, if that’s what you mean.” Jeff said, confused.<br />
<br />
The handsome young man blinked in confusion. “But…but you said you’d come to practice this season!”<br />
<br />
“Mmmmm…” Jeff didn’t remember saying anything of the sort.<br />
<br />
Had the Chronivac altered something? Ryan sped up. Jeff hustled down the hall faster to catch up, not even feeling out of breath. Apparently, he and Ryan were…friends now? The idea of being the big bad wolf’s best friend was….well, strange was one way to put it. Oddly exciting?<br />
<br />
“Come on, man, get changed, we’re going to be late!” Ryan insisted.<br />
<br />
He’d have to let the kid down easy, no two ways about it. Jeff was two years older than Ryan was, so he wasn’t sure how the Chronivac had made the decision to make them friends. They didn’t even share interests! Jeff was a geek and Ryan was a total jock.<br />
<br />
“Look, Ryan, I’m not a football player. I mean, look at me.” Jeff glanced down.<br />
<br />
And gasped.<br />
<br />
His body had changed. He was bigger, his shoulders broad, thighs thick with powerful muscles and his arms and chest were bulging. If Ryan’s body had been impressive, Jeff was more so. He was as huge as a bull!. Jeff took in his new appearance in shock, stumbling as they reached the locker room doors.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, you’re bigger than I am. So what? Have you seen my dad? Bet I’ll be bigger than you in a few years!” Ryan chuckled, smacking Jeff on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Jeff entered the locker room in a daze. All the other guys were in various states of undress, and everyone on the team greeted him as though they’d known him. They did know him…but as a nerd that they would pick on. He had no idea what it was like to be so big, People moved out of his way, creating a wake that Ryan trailed behind.<br />
<br />
He found his locker and opened it. Sure enough, all the football gear was in it. Shirts, cleats, padding, helmet. Everything a big muscular jock would need to practice in.<br />
<br />
“Hey, looks like coach hooked you up!” Ryan grinned, clapping Jeff on his broad back.<br />
<br />
Jeff grunted, only now realizing how incredibly deep his voice was. On the inside of the locker’s door was a mirror. Jeff found himself staring at his own reflection.<br />
<br />
He was brutish, the bones of his face thicker and more pronounced. He ran his fingers through the short, dense beard he was growing and noted the tufts of body hair poking form the top of his shirt. Jeff was massive, even for a sixteen year old, and clearly had a bit of a roid gut. Was he on drugs? Was that how he was keeping up with Ryan in this reality?<br />
<br />
The new behemoth opened the his phone and pulled up Ryan and his stats with thicker fingers.<br />
<br />
Name: Ryan Huff<br />
Age: 14<br />
Height: 6’5”<br />
Weight: 270 lbs (93% Muscle, 7% Fat)<br />
Hair: Black<br />
Eyes: Amber<br />
Body hair: Medium<br />
Facial hair: Sideburns<br />
Sexual Orientation: Bisexual (Virgin)<br />
Mannerisms: Jock, Flirty, Masculine, Lonely<br />
Status: Single (Best Friends With Jeff Davis)<br />
<br />
And then he opened his profile.<br />
<br />
Name: Jeff Davis<br />
Age: 16<br />
Height: 6’2”<br />
Weight: 310 lbs (93% Muscle, 7% Fat)<br />
Hair: Dark Brown<br />
Eyes: Emerald Green<br />
Body hair: Heavy<br />
Facial hair:Short Beard<br />
Sexual Orientation: Homosexual (Virgin)<br />
Mannerisms: Jock, Nerdy, Masculine, Lonely<br />
Status: Single (best Friends With Ryan Huff)<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at the stats. Somehow, by aging up Mr. Huff and being kind to him, the Chronivac had made him his best friend. Not only that, it appeared to have transformed him into the perfect best friend a jock like Ryan could ask for. Someone bigger than him that he could aspire to.<br />
<br />
“Oooh, you been lookin’ at your phone all day.” Ryan chuckled. “Got a hot date?”<br />
<br />
“Nah,” Jeff swallowed his horror. He needed to remain calm, he could fix this later. Jeff gave Ryan a smile. “Let’s play ball or whatever!”<br />
<br />
“Ha, hell yeah, bro!” Ryan slapped him high-five. “I knew you’d join the team ever since you started coming over and juicing up with me and Dad!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, of course.” Jeff chuckled back, but cringing inwardly. He really was doing steroids! “Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
They got changed and trotted out onto the field. The head coach, Mr. Brewell, was running drills. He was a big, tough man with a mean disposition. While he was hard on everyone, for some reason he had no problems with Jeff or Ryan. Then again, judging by his own performance…they were amazing football players. Jeff didn’t know what the Chronivac had done, but he never missed a tackle or fumble the ball. It was like his reflexes were doing all the work.<br />
<br />
He found himself really getting into it. Running with the ball and tackling people was exhilarating. Jeff wasn’t sure if it was his personality or the fake personality the Chronivac had injected him with that thought that, but working out and doing practice felt good. Still, he was winded and sweating by the end of practice and hustled off to the locker room to shower. Normally, he’d feel inadequate and embarrassed to shower with a bunch of guys, but he found himself peeling off his sweaty uniform, revealing his sweat-matted chest fur and the lengthy cock swinging heavily between his legs.<br />
<br />
Everything about him was so completely different that Jeff suspected this reality’s version of himself had used the Chronivac. That made much more sense than merely changing because he was Ryan’s best friend now. It also made him more than a little terrified of changing anything else with the device. Maybe change something that didn’t alter reality so severely.<br />
<br />
While Jeff was showering, he saw Ryan take up the shower next to him. The room was full of steam, but still Jeff could see his new best friend’s body, how muscular it was, how hairy-<br />
<br />
“Like what you see, Jeff?” Ryan grinned, staring at Jeff’s cock.<br />
<br />
Jed glanced down and saw it sticking straight up and throbbing, rock hard. He blushed and covered himself, shifting his body away from Ryan’s. How was he going to tell his best friend he wanted to have sex with him now, for some reason? And former teacher, no less!<br />
<br />
“Hey man, don’t feel bad, I get erections at the worst time.” Ryan’s grin softened when he noticed Jeff’s embarrassment. “There’s nothing wrong, we’re teenagers, shit happens.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, uh, sorry bro.” Jeff mumbled.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t be like that.” Ryan winked. “I don’t mind at all.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed harder and continued shampooing. His erection eventually went away just in time as the other players walked in. He rinsed off and left the showers, trying to put the incident behind him. When he opened his locker, he was confused for a moment. Had he opened the wrong locker? But Ryan opened his locker, which was right next to it, and Jeff realized what had happened. The clothes he’d put in his locker had changed into something more appropriate for a big, beefy jock.<br />
<br />
Reality appeared to be changing slowly to match his new form, then.<br />
<br />
“Bro,” Ryan placed a hand on Jeff’s shoulder and he jumped. “Whoa! Hey man, you need to relax. You’ve been acting weird ever since the hallway. You good?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, just…feeling out of it today.”<br />
<br />
“Well it didn’t show out on the field. You were amazing! I knew football was right for you.” Ryan nodded to himself, pulling out his phone and looking at something. He smiled. “Dad’s waiting for us in the parking lot. You ready?”<br />
<br />
“Your dad?” Jeff asked, shuddering at the thought of meeting the asshole who fucked Ryan’s mind up. <br />
<br />
“Yeah. He was sitting in the bleachers watching the whole time. He wants to take us both out for burgers to celebrate. Guess he thought you did great too.” Ryan grinned, eyeing Jeff up. “You really are perfect, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Perfect?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Erm, I meant for the football team!” Ryan’s smile faltered for a moment. “Come on, get your backpack, we can do homework at my place.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shouldered his backpack and followed the very eager Ryan back to the parking lot. Ryan’s dad, Richard, waited for them. He was a 6’7” behemoth of a man, a few inches taller than Jeff and much buffer, built like a brick shithouse. Richard was a very hairy, very masculine man, and his form was basically the pinnacle of masculinity. And he was glowering at Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Ryan! I told you to pick up your hustle. You dropped that ball twice. Jeff here was moving like a pro. Where the hell is your head at, boy?” Richard growled.<br />
<br />
“Sorry sir,” Ryan blushed and looked away, “I was distracted.”<br />
<br />
“Well stop playing grab-ass with your teammates and get your head in the game.” Richard thundered before opening the door. “Get in boys. Other than a few mistakes, you’ve earned dinner.”<br />
<br />
They got in. Jeff felt incredibly awkward. The truck was large and spacious, perfect for the three big men. Mr. Huff didn’t actually seem all that angry, despite his outward appearance, Jeff realized. This must just be him taking football THAT seriously.<br />
<br />
“You really need to focus, Ryan. You gotta get that scholarship.” Mr. Huff said quietly when they were all buckled up.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir, I know.”<br />
<br />
“You’re better than that.” Mr. Huff chided before putting the truck into gear. “Alright, Mickey D’s or The BK Lounge?”<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced over at Ryan, who shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Uh, whichever one has a working ice-cream dispenser.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Well, call them.” Richard said, starting the car and pulling out. “They’re right across the street from each other.”<br />
<br />
Jeff made to pull out his phone, but Ryan stopped him.<br />
<br />
“Nah, I got this.” Ryan pulled out his own phone-which looked a bit like Jeff’s, actually-and dialed up the two restaurants.<br />
<br />
“What’s the verdict?” Richard asked after Ryan hung up.<br />
<br />
“Mickey D’s has an operating ice cream machine.” Ryan replied.<br />
<br />
“Mickey D’s it is!” Richard said.</p>
