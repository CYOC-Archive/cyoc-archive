<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke from his sex change surgery later the same day. His groin felt like it had been run over by a semi truck and then shoved back into his pelvis. Bandages covered the area, and Jeff was afraid to touch it. Lightly patting the outside, he could feel the flatness beneath the gauze. “It’s gone!” Jeff yelled out happily, forgetting for a second he was in a shared room and talking to no one. But after hearing nothing from the other side of the wall he grew quiet.<br />
<br />
Slowly and carefully he worked his at the bottom edge of the bandage, trying to sneak a peak at his neovagina.  What lay underneath was worse than he imagined from the pain. Most of his nether regions were puffy and bruised, but his new opening was empty and dry.  Though a small stream of discharge dripped out of it, leaving a clear trail along the front of his hips, it was clear the fluid was urine and not vaginal discharge. None of that mattered to Jeff, he knew recovery was hard. Ecstatic that his dick and balls were gone, he quickly put his hands back to work at the top of the pad, hoping to get a glimpse of his clitoris. After several tries, he got lucky. He pulled away a piece of dried skin. Underneath, nestled within was a tiny penis-like protrusion topped with a cluster of wrinkled fleshy appendages. His new clit was half an inch long, rough and sore, and sat atop an already wounded area. All he could do was stare at it in awe, imagining the feeling of what was coming soon.<br />
<br />
The Doctor came to see him eventually, Jeff had to act surprised when the bandages finally came off, although it hurt more than anything else. His cock now showed as nothing but pink nub sticking straight out from his pelvis, surrounded by his new labia.<br />
<br />
The doctor explained that the operation had gone very well, except that his testicles weren’t removed as planned. Due to his anatomy, there was enough space in his abdomen to be relocated. They had taken the liberty of leaving them attached, so Jeff wouldn’t have to use hormones to maintain his muscles and male figure. <br />
<br />
“The surgeon left a few scars along your lower abdominal region and right above your groin,” the doctor told him. “That shouldn’t interfere with any athletic activities or swimming you might want to do.” The doctor pulled out a long plastic dilator, “Nurse Jones will show you how to use this. I understand you are already acquainted?” Nurse Jones winked at Jeff. Jeff felt his new pussy tingle, it was a new sensation he had never felt before. Kind of like the beginning of a boner, but with no swelling.<br />
<br />
When Nurse Jones finished his graphic demonstration on how to insert the plastic dildo inside his vagina, he removed his glove and held out the device for Jeff to give it a go on his own. Without thinking twice, he grabbed it and pushed it inside. It felt weird, like something was grabbing his former dick from the inside. Nurse Jones was shocked, “maybe we can try for round two?” But Jeff was heartbroken, his new pussy felt just like someone pushed stabbed his dick and pushed it inside him, he wanted a vagina, not some phantom penis. <br />
<br />
Nurse Jones explained that sensation would change. But Jeff was scared that this was something he’d have to deal with for the rest of his life. He hoped maybe, just maybe, the pain would subside, and the disgust he had towards his former manhood would disappear with it.<br />
<br />
At first it didn’t, being flat down there sure was nice, but his reconfigured parts still felt like a dick and balls. The catheter came out and the stitches would dissolve. He knew it would take time for his brain to rewire the signals coming from his now inverted genitals, but didn’t realize it would cause quite this much dysphoria. Even after he got home, he was only ever really comfortable when he took his pants off and was reminded of the choice he made. At least his dick and balls were gone, there was no turning back. The changes were irreversible. Everything that existed below his waist would stay there until his dying day.</p>
