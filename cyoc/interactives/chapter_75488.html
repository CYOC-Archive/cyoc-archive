<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Kaylee descended down the inside of the trunk of the tree that the fairy community that she, and now you, had joined lived in. Much of the interior of it was very interesting, and you were amazed how well doors and entrances to dwellings or shops inside the tree were carved. Eventually Kaylee stopped her descent and you then stopped to flutter beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are,&quot; Kaylee announced, &quot;my apartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It... uh...&quot; you stuttered out as you looked the decorated door that was the entrance to her apartment.<br />
<br />
Above the door was a little carved scroll that read &quot;Kaylee Perkins.&quot; On the door itself were more carvings, one for each of the four panels on the door. The first showed you as a male human and Kaylee as a female human walking through the park, Kaylee holding what looked like cotton candy. The one to the right of that one was Kaylee laying in the fairy ring and gazing up at clouds above her. Below that panel was Kaylee as a fairy standing among her human clothing, which was too big for her, and was being held to hide things children shouldn't see. You noticed that that image of Kaylee looked rather startled and almost frightened. The last panel was Kaylee in her flower petal dress, but she looked half depressed and was looking back over her shoulder as though she was hiding behind a tree branch. In the background, it looked like there was a picture of you standing on the ground and looking around looking lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really missed me,&quot; you spoke, reaching out to touch the image of Kaylee's fairy form looking to your human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Kaylee nodded, &quot;Many fairies that were once human commonly have a sort of story that tells how they became fairies... and now mine is incomplete...&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched again as Kaylee waived a hand. What looked like pink particles of light danced from her fingertips and floated to the door. As they made contact a center panel formed, either making the other four smaller or cutting out some parts. In some cases, the main image on the other panels also moved to make room for the new panel on Kaylee's door. Then, the new panel began to present a new &quot;carved&quot; image. It was of you in fairy form kissing Kaylee at the festival the two of you had just come from.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's pretty, Kaylee,&quot; you said looking at the new picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ada,&quot; Kaylee said with a smile, &quot;You can stay with me as long as you like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd hoped we could get married after I'm completely used to being a fairy and a girl,&quot; you said to her, &quot;I'm willing to be a fairy because it'll mean we'll be together forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not forever,&quot; Kaylee gave a chuckle, &quot;we'll live for a very long time, but even fairies die of old age, give or take a millennium or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a short whistle as Kaylee then opened the door and let you flutter in. You rapidly felt your wings stop beating as your feet touched the wood that was the floor of her apartment. You found it to be very smooth, as though it had been perfectly sanded and then varnished to a point where getting a splinter was impossible, which was good, since none of the fairies you'd seen, including Kaylee seemed to wear any shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks nice, Kaylee,&quot; you said as you entered, &quot;sort of like that old cabin when we went camping after graduating college.&quot;<br />
<br />
And it was like a cabin in many ways, and not just that it was all wooden. You couldn't see anything that looked like an electronic device in it, though it began to lighten as you and Kaylee entered. It had simple bed, which had a large quilt that looked like it was made of leaves. You reached out and touched it and found that the leaf quilt felt sort of like any other soft bedding material you'd ever known of. There was also a nightstand and a bookshelf along a far wall. You looked over to it, and found that it was full of books, though not ones you'd ever heard before.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're mostly a bunch of romance stories with a couple of fantasy adventure stories,&quot; Kaylee spoke up, noticing your looking at her bookcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantasy adventure?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stories about fairies adventuring far and wide, and doing things that no individual fairy could likely do by herself,&quot; Kaylee explained, &quot;and commonly involves curing werewolves, deterring vampires, saving the environment, and I think I have one where a fairy adopts a baby dragon... though she's heartbroken when the dragon grows up and she has to say goodbye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You now, before tonight, I would have thought that none of that was even possible... but now... now that I'm a fairy... I have to ask, is any of that possible?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves, vampires, and dragons?&quot; Kaylee asked back, &quot;if they are real, they've never come near this tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice place,&quot; you said as you looked around, amazed at how the room seemed to illuminate with just the two of you in it without any flipping of switches or lighting of candles. Maybe your own magic was lighting the room, or maybe Kaylee's magic since you didn't think you'd have any control over yours yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fairly small, but it's been cozy,&quot; Kaylee admitted, &quot;though somewhat lonely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll I'm here now,&quot; you told her, &quot;you'll help me get used to this and we'll get married and live for a millenia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee smiled to you and then nodded, &quot;and over there is the bathroom, complete with toilet, tub, shower, sink, and running water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Running water in a tree?&quot; you gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of it is run by magic, but it does also use the tree's natural transportation of water and nutrients as well, but it works,&quot; Kaylee said with a shrug, &quot;it's better then having to go outside to go to the little fairy's room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee then turned to another wall and motioned to it, &quot;and this is my mirror I was telling you about.&quot;<br />
<br />
And it was indeed a mirror. It was seemingly part of the wall itself and was beside a dresser. You slowly began to walk toward the mirror when you looked at the dresser.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you mind sharing?&quot; you asked Kaylee, &quot;I'll probably need to get more clothes for myself... probably all dresses, now, I suppose... and underwear... I'll need some underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dress has its own set of &quot;panties&quot; built in,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;there are two petals that will &quot;bend&quot; to cover everything, when you're flying above someone, or diving face first in a rush and someone above you is looking down. So all you'll need are new dresses. The dresses themselves will keep you covered... though we may need to go shopping as my dresses won't fit you very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; you asked, &quot;we're both girls now, aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you have a bit more bust than I do, Ada,&quot; Kaylee said as she grabbed you by the arm and pulled you to stand in front of the mirror beside her.<br />
<br />
And there you saw yourself, standing beside Kaylee<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... I'm... I'm beautiful,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
And you were. You still looked like &quot;you&quot; but now obviously in a more feminine shape rather then the masculine look your human form had. You could probably claim to be your sister if you had one. The place where you clearly differed from members of your family was in what us under the purple flower petal dress you were presently wearing. Sitting on your chest were a fairly large pair of breasts. You remembered that Kaylee was somewhere in the C range from the couple of times that you and her had fooled around after graduating high school and her breasts looked to you like they hadn't grown any since she became a fairy. Your breasts, however, looked obviously larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, you are, Ada,&quot; Kaylee hugged you from the side with a nice smile, &quot;though I might be a bit jealous for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nearly jumped when Kaylee began to cup and lift your right breast with her had. Her touch was gentle and soft, and you could easily feel it through your dress. It also generated a strange tingling and almost pushing sensation between your legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee!&quot; you managed a protest as a bright blush came to your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean come on, Ada,&quot; Kaylee shook her head, &quot;I've been a woman all my life. I naturally grew to a C cup. You're turned into a girl magically and you're a large C cup at the smallest. I'd even wager that you were a D cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be sorry,&quot; Kaylee said to you, gripping you by your hips, which were as wide as Kaylee's, &quot;be beautiful... love me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee then leaned forward to kiss you, and you kissed her back, feeling overjoyed to be with her again. The kiss grew more passionate and you felt that strange sensation coming from between your legs again, but you half ignored it. In fact, you began to fondle Kaylee's breasts through her dress as she began fondle yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Kaylee&quot; you said to Kaylee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Ada,&quot; Kaylee said with a smile, &quot;you won't believe how long I've waited for a night like this... and while this may seem mean to you... but I've kind of fantasized about you becoming a fairy to be with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's make fantasies come true,&quot; you told her, and kissed her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kaylee nodded, &quot;especially since we're nearly in full bloom.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made wonder about something as Kaylee's hands moved to the top of your dress and began to carefully pull it down...</p>
