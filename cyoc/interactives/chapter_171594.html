<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill waited for Clover to return to her seat before eating. As she sat down Clover briefly clasped his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. Bill looked at her and pleaded. ‘Please tell me this is a very elaborate joke’<br />
<br />
Clovers reply was another squeeze of his hand and a hushed. ‘I love you Bill’<br />
<br />
He ate his pudding but his appreciation was probably not as much as the taste deserved. He was actually feeling a bit queasy in his tummy. It didn’t help that everyone else on the table seemed to be observing him, but would turn away when he tried to meet their eyes.<br />
<br />
Uncle Eric was one of people who had been watching Bill and once he noticed Bill had finished eating, tapped a glass once more. Once again the room went silent. Even the kids table which had become quiet riotous.<br />
<br />
Eric stood up and addressed the room but he was looking straight at Bill. ‘Time to move on with our evening. Bill as the newcomer here I would invite you to go first. Clover, perhaps you might accompany your fiancé to the tree and help him through the procedure. Once finished we will go clockwise around the table from where Clover is sitting. Then I will start off the head table’ He sat down once more.<br />
<br />
Clover was immediately on her feet and gestured for Bill to stand up as well. His legs suddenly felt like jelly. Did he want to go through with this? Was Clover worth it? Clover tapped him on the shoulder. ‘Come on Bill. Delaying will just prolong things’. She was speaking quietly but as the room was still silent everyone must have heard her. <br />
<br />
Bill looked at Clovers face. It held a pleading look. That was what decided Bill. He loved this woman. He would do anything for her. He stood up and everyone clapped. Clover took his arm and led him up to the tree where a second pile of presents had been uncovered.<br />
<br />
Bill felt physically sick. Every instinct was telling him to flee. It was only the presence of Clover at his side and the feel of her hand in his that kept him there. The whole room was watching him and no doubt could tell he was petrified, that he was a coward.<br />
<br />
Clover whispered to him ‘How about I choose for you?’ All Bill could do was nod.<br />
<br />
Clover bent down and after a moment’s perusal picked up a present. To Bill they all looked the same. She handed it to him. ‘Open it and show everyone what you have’<br />
<br />
Now it was time for Bill’s fingers to turn to pieces of jelly. He fumbled at the ribbon trying to undo the knot but again Clover whispered ‘Just tear it.’ He did so. Revealed was a beige garment, wrapped in tissue paper. ‘Now hold it up and show it to everyone. <br />
<br />
With fumbly fingers Bill gripped the garment which felt like satin. He unfolded it to reveal a woman’s slip. Highly embarrassed he held it up so the room could see. It was the sort of garment he could remember his Mum wearing. Did it belong to one of Clover’s aunts? Or maybe her Mother? Bill was almost fainting with embarrassment. If they weren’t pranking him, who would he soon be? He hoped like hell his best mate Paddy would suddenly enter the room and say “Gotcha!”<br />
<br />
However he wasn’t rescued. Clover said loudly ‘Well into the bathroom. I’ll accompany you and show you what to do’<br />
<br />
Bill was happy to go into the room and get out of the spotlight. The door closed behind Clover. <br />
<br />
The room was bigger than Bill expected. There were some toilet cubicles and an enclave with numbered open divided shelves. There were also hooks with dressing gowns hanging on them. Ominously on the wall in front of him was a stone. As he watched it appeared to sparkle just as Uncle Eric had described.<br />
<br />
Next to the stone was a full-length mirror.<br />
<br />
‘Get undressed down to your undies and put what you are wearing into cubicle number 1’ instructed Clover. ‘Remember it is always a good idea to undress before you touch the stone otherwise your clothes might rip’<br />
<br />
‘But this is a woman’s garment. I don’t want to be a woman.  Who will I become?’<br />
<br />
‘There is only one way to find out. Come on Bill be brave. Do it for me’<br />
<br />
Bill hung the slip on a hook then undressed. As he did so Clover took each item of his clothing and neatly folded them before placing them in the cubicle labelled “1” ‘This is so who-ever gets to walk in your shoes can find something to wear’<br />
<br />
Soon Bill was down to just his boxer shorts. They were a gift to him from Clover for his recent 24th birthday.<br />
 <br />
‘Okay now pick up the slip and touch it to the stone. Best to brace yourself as people have been known to stumble’<br />
<br />
Bill reached for the slip, lifting it off the hook. He took one last look at Clover ‘Is Paddy going to be outside? Am I being filmed?’<br />
<br />
‘No Bill. This is our family tradition. It’s real’ She looked sincere.<br />
<br />
Bill touched the garment to the stone.</p>
