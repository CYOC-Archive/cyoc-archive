<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Then Jennifer remembered the other thing Kyle had said. Nobody else except for Kyle and her friends would think she had changed. Still, the thought of appearing in front of her friends as a nearly seven-foot-tall cowgirl with a ridiculous bulge hanging from her stomach was just as bad as appearing that way to everyone else. She used to take pride in her looks. The irony was eating her up inside.
<P>In fact, it actually felt like something was eating her up inside. Her stomach felt like it was caving in. She bent over in pain. For some reason, she felt hungry in a way she never had before.
<P>Jennifer stumbled down the stairs. It was hard enough with her new hooves, but the disorientation from intense hunger pains made it even worse. After what felt like forever, she made her way into the kitchen. Throwing open the refrigerator door, she searched for something that would please her stomach.
<P>The leftover lasagna, which she had enjoyed very much the night before, appeared revolting to her now. She didn't take pause to figure out why, however, as her mind was preoccupied with stuffing her face as quickly as possible. In one drawer she found some bags of salad mix. Tearing them open, she stuffed the leaves and shredded carrots into her mouth. If her hunger pains decreased at all, it was hardly noticeable. She tore through the rest of the fridge, eating what vegetables she could find.
<P>Hardly satisfied, she slammed the door shut and scrambled to her feet. She took little notice of the extra difficulty she had standing up, but if she had thought about it she would have sworn she was a bit heavier than a minute before.
<P>Her eyes darted around the kitchen, but found no pleasing food. Finally she saw the sink, and agreed that she was as thirsty as she was hungry. Turning on the tap, she bent her head into the sink and sucked on the faucet. She drank gallon after gallon, hoping desperately to fill the void inside her. When the hunger didn't yield, she shut the water off and slammed her hooves on the counter in frustration.
<P>Then her eyes looked out the window into her backyard. She saw the luscious green grass it contained and her appetite increased tenfold. She ran outside and threw herself on the ground, scarfing up hundreds of blades of grass in seconds. Her hand-hooves dug into the dirt, wresting clumps of grass from their roots and shoving them into her mouth. As she ate, she finally began to feel content. Her stomach felt like it was expanding inside of her, pushing aside her other organs.
<P>She got up into a sitting position among the bare dirt she had already picked through. Her hands were still at work gathering more grass to eat, but the urgency of consumption had waned. She felt her bottom sinking farther and farther into the loose soil, and also noticed it was taking more effort to move her arms. Thinking back a few seconds ago, just bringing herself to sit upright seemed to take more force than she was used to. She looked down at her arms after stuffing another clump of grass into her mouth and realized for the first time what was happening.
<P>Her arms were much wider than normal. They used to be a bit skinny, with well-defined muscles. Now those muscles were almost unnoticeable among the fat that had developed. Looking down at the rest of her body, she found that her hourglass figure had filled out into a rather  wide frame. She wasn't quite obese, but she was certainly fatter than she used to be. Her stomach above her udder was rounding out a bit. As she looked closer, she could actually notice subtle changes happening inside. She felt her insides rearranging themselves, and the movement of her skin clued her into the fact that her one stomach was dividing itself into multiple copies. No wonder she needed to eat so badly. Her body needed to enlarge to allow more room for internal organs.
<P>Even her thighs had ballooned out, looking much more able to support her new weight as well as her large udder.
<P>And speaking of her udder, it seemed to be swelling even more now. Large veins could be seen pumping blood underneath the pink flesh which had continued to stretch from the weight and size of the thing. Now it was much larger than a soccer ball as it pressed firmly against her legs.
<P>She wanted to touch it, but her hands were still preoccupied with grabbing blades of grass and shoving them into her mouth. It took a bit of willpower, but she finally tore one hand away from its task and probed the large udder. It was tender and squishy, bringing her strange sensations. She grabbed it with both hands from underneath, trying to lift it up. It felt like it weighed forty or fifty pounds.
<P><I>If that's how heavy my udder is, what about the rest of me?</I> Jennifer thought to herself. Now that her many stomachs were full and content, she maneuvered her legs to push herself up. It took some work, and a few failed attempts, but she finally got used to her new girth and stood upright.
<P>She was very curious--and also terrified--of how much she weighed. As a cheerleader she was mindful to stay under 110 pounds, and managed that quite well. Now she feared she had tripled her weight. She went to the scale in her bathroom, knowing she didn't want the answer but too curious to stop herself. The scale read 390 pounds.
<P>"Oh, noooo!" she screamed. What terrified her even more than her confirmed weight gain was the voice that escaped her lips. It was deeper than it was supposed to be, though not deep enough to sound like a boy's. It sounded just as if Jennifer tried to imitate a real cow...though it was clearly not an imitation. "Even my voooice is wrong," she muttered. Still, she was glad she could even talk at all.
<P>Her changes seemed complete. There were no more odd tingling sensations, no more hunger pains. Jennifer was a bona-fide cowgirl.</p>
