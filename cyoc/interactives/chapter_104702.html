<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After departing the Youth Ministry gathering, Lennard and Danielle headed over to Elbow Park. Despite the odd name, the park was a lovely place to visit, with its various trails and wide fields of flowers. In fact, it was their favorite spot to spend time with one another away from the daily rush of their busy lives. Had they been able to recall their previous lives, they might&#39;ve been surprised to discover that Allen and Dani also liked the park, but for very different reasons.<br />
<br />
Walking hand in hand down one of the trails, the couple were enjoying the lovely spring day, each content that they&#39;d found their one true soulmate. However, their moods soured as they rounded a bend on the path. Ahead of them, sitting on benches were two other couples. But unlike them, none of them were pure or appropriate in the eyes of the Lord.<br />
<br />
The two women were kissing while the men held each other lovingly. It would seem that some lingering trace of their old selves had brought the Christian couple to the part of Elbow Park favored by those of their former sexual preferences. Or maybe it was the curse, looking for more victims to be spread to. Either way, Lennard and Danielle&#39;s smiles quickly turned into scowls of barely contained contempt for the people around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you live with yourselves,&quot; Lennard angrily asked the lesbian couples,&quot;Don&#39;t you know that your gay ways are a sinful affront to Heaven, and a perversion of real love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you two are wasting the blessings that our Lord gave you,&quot; shouted Danielle at the men, &quot;You should be seeking the true martial love that only a man and a woman can share.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two gay couples were shocked at the sudden intrusion of these two bigots into their world, but none of them knew quite how to respond to them. Marilyn and Sharon had stopped in mid-kiss, while Eric and Pete could only stare daggers. However, neither couple could&#39;ve known that the reason for the weakness of their responses was the curse getting its hooks into them as a disgusted Lennard and Danielle continued down the path. However, once they looked back at their respective partners,the first tingles of attraction passed over them, and triggered their transformations.<br />
<br />
The first noticable effect for the two soon-to-be ex-lesbians was a change in their appearances. Overall, the brunette Sharon and the blonde Marilyn were plain-looking Neither of them were awful to look at, but they weren&#39;t knockouts either.  Each of them did dress in more masculine style, with Sharon favoring boots, jeans and a button-down flannel shirt while Marilyn wore a t-shirt, cargo shorts and sneakers. <br />
<br />
But their clothes began to shift and change. Sharon&#39;s hiking boots tore themselves apart, twisting down into a pair of pink and white trainers, even as her thick woolen socks thinned and slid downwards to become clean white crew socks. Marilyn&#39;s white sneakers were being consumed by a wave of black, as their soles thinned and two-inch heels jutted outward. Her athletics socks crawled up her legs, thinning into a pair of stockings.<br />
<br />
The seams of Sharon&#39;s jeans vanished, as did her pockets. The material shifted from dull denim to shiny black lycra, tightening to emphasize her legs which seemed more and more like they belonged to someone who did a lot of running. A trio of pink lines ran down the sides, as her thighs thickened and her calves bulged with new tone. Her somewhat flat ass began expanding outward, stretching the seat of her jogging pants even more.<br />
<br />
Pockets on Marilyn&#39;s cargo shorts began sealing up and fading back into the material, even as it shifted from khaki cotton to forest green wool. The legs of the shorts split and fused together into one tube, as the new skirt slid down to stop above her knees. The top of her stockings clipped on the garter belt that now lay just under the skirt, as her legs grew leaner and longer, the sheerness of the hosiery shining in the afternoon sun.<br />
<br />
Sharon&#39;s flannel shirt was losing its colors, as the material thickened into black cotton. The buttons down the front popped off one by one as a new zipper pulled past them. There was a tugging from the collar of the changing shirt, as it grew backwards and widened into an unmistakable hood. The cuffs of the developing hoodie became more elastic as they slid up her forearms which were getting more toned by the second. Pink lines and accents matching the ones on her jogging pants quickly came into being, with the interior of the hood matching as well. Underneath the hoodie, a basic bra changed into a tight pink sports bra that strained a little to contain the perky c-cups they now held over a taut stomach.<br />
<br />
There were ripping sounds as Marilyn&#39;s t-shirt split itself down the center, revealing the modest bra she&#39;d been wearing. The two halves of the t-shirt shifted from dull cotton to smooth black silk. A line of buttons appeared down the left side of the tear, with matching holes on the other side. The bra likewise was twisted itself into something sturdier to better support the new firm d-cups it now contained. An invisible force pulled the front of the new blouse mostly closed, leaving an excellent view of Marilyn&#39;s bountiful new cleavage. The sleeves of the former t-shirt grew longer, gaining cuffs along the way as they stopped just below her elbows. Her arms were smoother now, toned but not overly muscled.<br />
<br />
Across from them, the changes for Eric and Pete had also begun. Both men had slender builds, not overly muscular. They were dressed in causal slacks and polo shirts with loafers. However, their new straight identities were beginning to make themselves known, starting with their clothes.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s brown loafers darkened to a solid grey, as wide white laces sprang forth to tighten across the top of his feet. The soles of the shoes became thick black rubber, as a familiar white swoosh appeared on the side. There was some cracking as the feet contained in the new cross-trainers grew to fit them, while black dress socks became white crew ones. Pete&#39;s footwear also changed, with thin black laces slithering out of new holes to pull the shoe together more tightly. Cheap brown leather became glossy black as the heels thickened. Polished to a near-mirror finish, there were creaks from across the dress shoes as his feet filled them out, his socks now expensive silk instead of cheap cotton.<br />
<br />
Already black, Eric&#39;s slacks began grow tighter as they shifted from thick cotton to slick lycra. They also began to crawl up past his knees, as his calves grew bigger with  bulging muscles. His thigh muscles were outlined in detail as the former slacks finished becoming black compression pants. His ass was tighter as well, even as a series of pops and cracks pushed his height up by inches. The bulge at the front plumped up.<br />
<br />
Pete&#39;s brown slacks seemed to be swallowed up by dark grey and tightened around his legs. Crisp seams and the beginnings of white pinstripes began to appear, even as the muscles of the legs inside grew thicker and longer. A fine black leather belt with a gold buckle snaked around his waist, as his briefs became silk boxers. The extra room in his undergarments allowed his growing cock some well deserved breathing space.<br />
<br />
The polo shirt worn by Eric had been criss-crossed with white and pink horizontal stripes, but now they faded into grey.  The short sleeves rolled up past his shoulders leaving the now bulging muscles of his biceps and forearms for everyone to see. His stomach was sudden rocked with pain as a six-pack pushed its way outward. This was followed by his pectorals pressing forwards and pulling his new Underarmor running shirt even tighter. His collar tore away, the material hardening into a pair of sunglasses that hung around a neck with thickening cords of muscle.<br />
<br />
The changes to Pete&#39;s shirt were more drastic, as it seemed to gain layers as its sleeves lengthened down his now muscular arms. The bottommost layer turned white, with the trio of buttons at the top of the polo now stretching down its middle, as the material thinned into a fine dress shirt. Gold cuff-links fastened its cuffs tightly around his wrists, as a starched collar buttoned itself around a thicker neck. Meanwhile the topmost layer was growing grayer, as familiar white pinstripes began flow across it. A wide collar and lapels snapped into existence. Completing this new ensemble was the wide red tie that knotted itself into place, with a matching fabric square sticking out of the pocket that popped into place over his left breast.<br />
<br />
Now there came a changing of partners, as the curse began ramping up for the final phase of their changes. Sharon stood up, and started to walk towards the other bench, passing Pete along the way. As they each sat down again, the four people were rapidly bombarded by memories of new partners and new lives. <br />
<br />
Pete and Marilyn remembered their first date, and how awkward they&#39;d been that night at the restaurant. Sudden disgust at such thoughts bubbled up, as they tried to hold onto their old selves, but more and more memories of their loving times together filled up their minds. Likewise, Eric and Sharon were coping with a growing attraction to one another, which washed over their previous feelings. They&#39;d met at the gym right?<br />
<br />
As new identities began to emerge, the final changes to the new couples began. As Marilyn gave way to Mary, her short blonde bob began to darken, thick auburn curls  growing past her shoulders. Her cheekbones shifted upwards, as her now thicker red lips parted to reveal a perfect white smile. Blues eyes became hazel, as a string of pearls draped themselves around her neck, with a matching set of earrings now dangling from her ears. The black leather purse that hung from her shoulder complimented the gold bracelets that wrapped themselves around her wrists.<br />
<br />
Stunned by the new face in front of him, Pete&#39;s new self took control. His right hand reached up adjust his tie, a solid gold Rolex fastened around it. His formerly gentle features vanished under a more rugged appearance, with a squared jaw and a dazzling smile. His buzz cut hair exploded into a slicked back do, brown eyes turning green. In his pants&#39; front pocket, the comforting weight of a small box caused Peter&#39;s cock to rise to attention. This was the day he&#39;d been waiting for, to pop the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, would you marry me,&quot; asked Peter in a slightly nervous voice as he pulled forth the box and presented the diamond ring towards the love of his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...Y..Yes,&quot; answered a stunned Mary, feeling more than little happy about this moment. She was going to be a bride at last!<br />
<br />
<br />
Across the way, the tightly cut brunette hair of Sharon burst into a long blonder mess that quickly pulled itself into a cute ponytail. Her somewhat long nose crunched down smaller, as her thin lips swelled into a perfect pink pout. Brown gave way to clear blue in her eyes, as her higher cheeks blushed with warmth. The pink earbuds that snaked up from the iPhone hanging at her waist were soon pumping Shari&#39;s head with the latest hit pop song, as her jaw flexed narrower with each chew of the gum in her mouth. She stood up to stretch.<br />
<br />
Eric struggled to hold onto his old self, not wanting to give into the new cocky attitude that seemed to be welling up inside him. He tried to look over at Pete, but his gaze somehow turned towards the babe stretching on the bench next to him. That tight ass was so damned hot, thought Eric as his formerly long hair pulled into a close cropped look. The cocky grin on his tanned face only widened as he though of the fun they&#39;d be having later. He reached up to scratch the stubble that covered his lantern jaw, before swatting his girlfriend on her butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, babe. We should get goin&#39;,&quot; said Ric with more than a hint of lust in his voice, &quot;. Got &#39;nother half-kilo before we&#39;ve done. Don&#39;cha want to get the prize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, baby,&quot; responded Shari in an airy voice,&quot;Just try and stop me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two happy heterosexual couples, oblivious to their previous relationships with one another, went off on their separate ways.  Little did each know they now were carriers of the curse, doomed to spread it to any homosexual they might insult along the way.</p>
