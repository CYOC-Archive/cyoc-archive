<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will stood naked in the shower silently crying. He had never really been much of a emotional person, but suddenly he felt so emotional it wasn't funny. And the changes his body was going through, and Megan's apparent transformation, plus the fact that his job had never heard of him was just to much. And so he stood in the shower, silently crying as the hot water ran over his now alien body.<br />
<br />
He'd woken up about two hours after he and Megan had made love for the second time in their altered states and the first thing he had done was headed for the bathroom, wanting to see if there where anymore changes.<br />
In the bathroom he wanted to scream at what he saw.<br />
<br />
Somehow he had had a pair of woman's boxers and a spaghetti strap tank top put on him while he was asleep. To make it all worse the outfit, he thought of it as sleepwear, made him look even more like a woman and he slowly began to pull off the light blue top and white boxers. And what he saw nearly made him cry right then and there.<br />
<br />
He still had his masculine form, for the most part, but his chest was now a C cup, like Megan's, while all of his body hair, except for his eyebrows and the hair on his head, had vanished. Pacing back and forth in front of the mirror, Will asked himself, &quot;What did I do to deserve this punishment,&quot; but stopped when he noticed how he walked, how he carried himself and how pivoted his waist and butt back and forth when he walked.<br />
<br />
Touching his breast, he felt a shiver of pleasure ripple down his body and quickly snatched his hand away. Touching the thin strip of pubic hair on his crotch, he let his hand drop until it was below his legs. And then, without thinking about, he began gently to massage his clitoris and clitoris hood with his thumb and forefinger.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;What the hell am I doing,&quot; Will pulled his hand back and looked into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Unable to think of what he did to deserve such a punishment, Will turned on the shower, not even giving a second thought to what was happening to Megan.<br />
<br />
Inside the shower, the hot water felt good against his body, especially against the breast and his crotch. And then about five minutes into washing himself, Will finally broke down and began to cry. As he silently sobbed, he started to whisper over and over again, &quot;Please, take it back. I'm sorry for what ever I did,&quot; but no answer came.<br />
<br />
Standing there, he kept whispering as he cried, &quot;Take it back, take it back. Just let me be...let me be....&quot;<br />
<br />
And then a cold fear swept over his body as he suddenly realized that he could no longer remember his male name. And the more he tried to force it, the further it retreated. Scared, he finished and stepped out the shower, trying to remember his name, but nothing came to him.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom, he went to his dresser and stopped. Someone had gone through it and taken, what he could see, a pair of slacks, a turtle neck, a pair of his socks and a pair of his boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
And as he stood in front of the dresser, the name Penny came to mind and he announced out loud, &quot;My name is Penny,&quot; and then began to take things from the dresser, trying to decide what looked good together and what he should wear.<br />
<br />
About ten minutes into the task, Penny gave up and headed for Megan's dresser and wardrobe. Stilling thinking herself as being male, she was loathe to the idea of wearing woman's clothes, but reasoned that if she had to look like a woman, she might as well dress like one. &quot;At least until I can reverse all that is happening,&quot; Penny told herself as she sat down in front of Megan's vanity and began to go through the other woman's stuff.<br />
<br />
First Penny chose a pair of low-cut bikini briefs, something in her mind upset on the way they felt against her crotch, but at the same time liking the silky feeling of the panties. Next she took a bra that made her look more perky and put that on.<br />
<br />
Something of her male self was horrified at how feminine she looked, but Penny didn't want to stop and instead went to find something to complement her choice in undergarments.<br />
<br />
From the dresser, she took a pair of denim jeans with buttons on the crotch and after putting them on, thought that they made her butt look smaller, hating the fact that she had such a masculine body, but liking the way they made her legs look longer. After that, she chose a light blue t-shirt and putting that on, she went back to the vanity.<br />
<br />
As she sat and worked with the perfume and brushes for the hair on her head, Megan silently entered the room behind her.<br />
<br />
Things where getting weird and Megan knew it. She was wearing a pair of slacks that belonged to someone, but she couldn't remember. The same went for the boxers and the shirt. But at the same time she thought they belonged to her.<br />
<br />
And what was even more confusing was that she had started thinking herself as Brandon and not Megan. Confused, but liking all that was happening, she strutted across the room toward Penny and putting her arms around the woman, she whispered into her ear, &quot;Morning baby. Are you hungry, cause I figured we could go out for breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny, who both liked and was horrified by Brandon's touch, leaned back and looking up, kissed him on the mouth and told him without thinking about it, &quot;That would be nice. Just let me finish up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon returned the kiss and replied, &quot;Don't take to long,&quot; and exited the room.<br />
<br />
Sitting at the vanity, the male side of her returned in a blast and Penny suddenly felt like crying again. Looking it the mirror, noting that he hair was a shade lighter, she told herself, &quot;I have to find away out of this. It's just so wrong and completely freaky.&quot;</p>
