<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary was walking down the hall the Tuesday after the end of the latest round of transformations. His hand was rubbing his newly smooth face. When his mother had heard he would be meeting with some recruiters, she had demanded that he be “presentable” and not look like a hobo.<br />
	<br />
“I’ll not have any son of mine looking like he had been living on the street for the last month.” Gary’s mother had told him that morning.<br />
	<br />
Because he was not paying attention, Gary was startled by some books falling at his feet as he turned a corner. Looking around, Gary noticed Devin, one of the biggest nerds in his school, beginning to gather the books and binders on the ground. Unfortunately, Gary also saw that the one who had been messing with Devin was one of his teammates, Neil. Neil had been the first string wide receiver before Tyler’s growth, but while most of the guys on the team liked Tyler, Neil, because of his odious personality, was only tolerated. Seeing him treated Devin like trash caused Gary to shake his head.<br />
	<br />
Gary waited until Neil had gone around the corner before he picked up the book at his feet. Walking across the hallway, Gary could see Devin visibly trembling in fear. “Here you go dude. Sorry about Neil.”<br />
	<br />
“No problem.” Devin replied, quietly. Not willing to look Gary in the eye, Devin pushed the last of his things into his backpack and turned to walk away.<br />
	<br />
“Hey, hold up.” Gary said grabbing Devin by the shoulder. “I know that Neil can be a jerk, and I’ll talk to coach and see if he can do anything, but in the meantime, have you ever thought about joining one of the teams here? I know Neil wouldn’t give you as much grief if you had a team to watch your back.”<br />
	<br />
Glancing up, a bitter smile appeared on Devin’s face, “No offense, but I don’t like sports. But don’t worry, he does this at least twice a week so I’m use to this.” Devin then turned and headed down the hall.<br />
	<br />
Gary stood there watching Devin walk away when a small hand slipped inside his own and gave it a gentle squeeze. Looking down, Gary smiled finding Lucy standing there with a small smile on her face. “That was really nice of you.”<br />
	<br />
“Neil was picking on him again.”<br />
	<br />
Scowling at the sound of Neil name, Lucy replied, “Ever since he lost his first string position as wide receiver, he has gotten worse and worse. By the way, I’m missing the beard.”<br />
	<br />
Shrugging his massive shoulders, “Mom said I had to shave it because of the scouts coming today. I’ll grow it back out after all of people here to see me have left.”<br />
	<br />
“Good,” Lucy replied. Standing on here tiptoes and pulling Gary down to whisper in his ear, “I like my bear of a man hairy.” Then giving him a quick peck on the cheek, she turned and headed to her next class.<br />
	<br />
Watching as Lucy swayed her hips as she walked away, Gary groaned and felt his cock grow hard as steel. Knowing he would not be able to get through class without taking care of the consequences of Lucy’s words, Gary headed for the closest bathroom. <br />
<br />
Gary looked into the mirror in his bathroom. It was the Sunday evening and he would be picking up Lucy in a little over an hour. After a couple of days of scouts coming to school, Gary’s mother had stopped forcing him to shave allowing Gary to regrow his beard. Looking in the mirror after having taken a shower, Gary could see why Lucy called him a bear, but even more so why a scout from a professional team had come with the scouts. Not only was every part of his body huge, most especially the part between his legs, but with the amount of hair on  his body, Gary did look lie a bear. <br />
	<br />
Starting with his thick beard, the hair covered his entire chest, grew up over his shoulders, and down his arms only ending on his fingers. Turning around, Gary was able to see that the hair did not just end with his arms and shoulders, but continued onto his back. Looking past his fur covered pecs, Gary saw hair thick enough to obscure his abs. Sure, they were still rock hard, bowing out like a turtle’s shell with no fat to be found, but he had so much hair, the rug went from collar bone to his groin in one thick carpet. Wearing shirts, he would have hair poking out over the top of his shirt. Hair continued down from his groin covering his legs and ending on the top of his feet, with hair on each of his toes. <br />
	<br />
With the amount of hair on his body, and his shear size, there had been a number of time that he had found himself being mistaken for someone in their late twenties. One of the scouts had even thought that Gary was the assistant coach. Of course, when the scout had been corrected, Gary did not miss the delight that appeared in the man’s eyes.<br />
	<br />
Yeah, I really do look like a bear. Gary thought smiling.<br />
	<br />
Later that night, after Gary empty another load into Lucy’s pussy, the pair lay on the bed enjoying some time just laying with Lucy on top of Gary. Lucy kept running her hands through his body hair and beard when she suddenly heard Gary start to slightly snore. <br />
	<br />
Giggling hearing her love bear, Lucy climbed off of Gary and rapped herself in one of his arms. Lucy loved the way she felt so small next to Gary and yet at the same time protected. As she drifted off to sleep enjoying the feel of his body hair, a stray thought crossed her mind, ‘I’m going to have his kids and they are all going to be giant bearish boys like their father.’</p>
