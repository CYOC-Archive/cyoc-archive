<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...she was stunned to see her ideal dinner staring her in the face! &quot;Ooh, dinner! Wait, wasn&#39;t I asleep on the couch? How&#39;d I get to the table?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic,&quot; Noah truthfully said, but in a way that made the statement sound like a joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny,&quot; Ashley replied as she grabbed a plate and a slice of pizza. &quot;Seriously, though, was I that out of it that I don&#39;t remember how I got over here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did have a nasty day today, by any standards. Maybe.&quot; Noah exhaled, thinking &#39;well, that&#39;s one way out of that problem&#39;.<br />
<br />
Ashley sighed as well, but grinned after a moment. &quot;Yeah, it was. But at the same time it brought us together. That&#39;s a good thing.&quot; She raised the slice up to her mouth, and realized how big it seemed. &quot;Where is this pizza from? This is the widest, longest slice I&#39;ve ever seen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah headed to the table, observing the diminutive girl sitting there before taking a seat for himself. &quot;Just one of the local joints. I guess they&#39;re trying out a super large pizza to drum up business.&quot; How strong was the magic in this ring, anyway? She was finding an oddity every second, and yet no alarm bells were going off in her mind... yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m game for that!&quot; she gleefully commented before taking a full bite out of the slice. Or as full as a 4-foot girl would make, anyway.<br />
<br />
&#39;Amazing,&#39; Noah silently remarked. With Ashley diving headfirst into the meal, he figured he might as well do the same. It sure looked tasty.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, that was unbelievably delicious. I am absolutely stuffed!&quot; Ashley exclaimed at the end of dinner. &quot;I haven&#39;t felt this full in a long time... but I don&#39;t think I ate much more than I&#39;m used to. Strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must have been the breadsticks,&quot; Noah shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... yeah, bread is filling.&quot; Ashley got up from the chair, with her feet dropping a bit harder to the ground than she was used to. The jolt dislodged what remained of her clothing a bit, and it was now in very real danger of falling off altogether. &quot;That&#39;s a high chair there,&quot; she remarked. Suddenly, she felt a cool breeze from her waist down, at which point she realized why there was a breeze at all. &quot;What the hell? Where&#39;s my skirt? And... damn! My panties! What did I do in my sleep, imagine I was taking a shower?&quot; She shrugged, which shifted her blouse to one side. &quot;And why is my top so loose? This was tight earlier! Same with my shoe!&quot; The look of pleasure from the meal gave way to a look of confusion. &quot;Noah, none of this makes sense. Did something happen? I mean, this is some strange shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, Noah realized how potent the magic was. If this didn&#39;t set off absolute panic in Ashley&#39;s mind, nothing would. And he was too nice to keep Ashley in the dark. Silently, he wished for Ashley to be aware of how small she had become. &quot;Ashley...&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah was immediately interrupted by a now-petrified Ashley. &quot;Oh my god! The big pizza, my clothes...&quot; She walked over gingerly to the couch, where the remainder of her clothes laid in a circular pool. Picking up the skirt, she marveled at how big it seemed to her now. This wasn&#39;t right. &quot;Noah! Do you have a ruler? Something is really, really wrong here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed and stood up, approaching his tiny classmate. &quot;I&#39;ll do you one better.&quot; Ashley&#39;s look of confusion and fear deepened as he came near, looking absolutely gigantic. &quot;I&#39;m 5&#39;9.5&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that can&#39;t be right, I&#39;m 5&#39;1&quot; and you&#39;re... huge!&quot; A wave of terror came over Ashley, and her face went pale. &quot;Unless... I&#39;m not 5&#39;1&quot; anymore. Oh shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah was filled with guilt at this point, both for inadvertently altering Ashley&#39;s mind and intentionally changing her size with the ring. &quot;Ashley, I have to be honest here. Before we encountered each other at school earlier, I found this ring. And I know this is going to sound like total sci-fi, but it&#39;s magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I&#39;m not sure I believe that, but I guess it&#39;s no weirder than the rest of today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when I went off at you, I said a couple things that I think the ring took as wishes. You weren&#39;t able to talk for a bit, and before that I said something about shutting up. And then I said that I wished you were the person I believed you once were, someone who could love me, and I think that led to everything tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley&#39;s face went blank. &quot;You did say those things.&quot; She collected her thoughts, only to utter &quot;Whoa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about everything. I re-shaped your mind, how you think, and that&#39;s not right. Let me undo this mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Ashley protested. &quot;No, this is right! How I&#39;m feeling is right! I do love you, and I always secretly did! The years of bullying were a mask!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Honestly, I feel free now that I&#39;m being real with myself. I used you, made your life hell to promote my own popularity and standing, and that&#39;s not right. At. All. I want to redeem myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, well... OK. I have to admit one other thing, though, and this might be a deal breaker. After I thought that the ring had power, I tested it in a way that would make it clear one way or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what way was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wishing for something that is utterly impossible scientifically. For you to shrink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?!&quot; Ashley exclaimed with a bit of annoyance. &quot;Noah! I&#39;m tiny as it is!&quot; She gulped, realizing that this was the reason for the oversized clothes. &quot;Or I guess was. Shit, I must be ridiculously short now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and I&#39;m sorry again. I swear this was just a test of the ring. But I can reverse this too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley sighed. &quot;I know. Noah...&quot; She paused again for a moment, processing everything she had heard. Finally, she commented, &quot;All right. I can let this slide. It&#39;s not right, but I know you. I know you didn&#39;t do it for twisted reasons. And, look, I&#39;ve been a bitch for years. I deserved something like this. But ask first in the future, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at her clothes while adding, &quot;At least the test worked. Look at me, I&#39;m a total shrimp now. Everyone I&#39;ve picked on would love to know I ended up like this. Karma&#39;s a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like we both learned something from the test,&quot; Noah replied, to which Ashley nodded in agreement. &quot;All right, time to start fresh, a new beginning for us as friends. And to start on that road, let&#39;s fix your height. As promised, where it ends up is totally your call.&quot;</p>
