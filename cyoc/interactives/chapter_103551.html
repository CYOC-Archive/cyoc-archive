<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This is a story about the Scavenger Hunt. A transformation based search game where contestants must find packets of blue and red &quot;slime&quot; to transform and (hopefully) hinder their opponents. <br />
<br />
There are no rules about what the packets will turn someone into, be it expansion (full body or specific area[hair, feet, breasts, belly]), growth, completely changing a persons body type (eg person to dwarf, fairy, neanderthal or obese), animal or inanimate. I encourage diversity and creativity. <br />
<br />
Not all packets will be extreme TFs. For instance, a person may change completely into a giraffe, but another person may become an anthro dog. Another person may just grow bunny ears. ANYTHING GOES. <br />
<br />
Blue packets = Transform <br />
Red Packets = Revert Last TF. Think of it as the &quot;undo&quot; button<br />
Green packets = Reset<br />
<br />
Green packets are much rarer and will restore a person completely back to normal. Clothes do not last long in this game.<br />
<br />
The object of the game is to find a small key and an egg within the play area. The play area is an abandoned and repurposed military base some where in the East United States. When the key and egg are united by 2 teammates, something special happens. Player choice. Make it big, make it awesome. <br />
<br />
But that is, ultimately how you win the game. <br />
<br />
Players who do not win, are reverted to a livable state of their current body (immobilized by breast size - the game reduces the breast size to a mobile size). Losers will remain this way until they volunteer to play the game again, from there they are reverted back to normal of their changed self. If a man swaps genders, he starts the new game as a woman - for example.<br />
<br />
This is Male and Female TF story. Enjoy!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;This is The Scavenger Hunt!&quot; the host announces to you and the rest of the group. You look over at your teammate and close friend Michelle and give a nervous laugh. You know you signed up for. You look down at your self and take in your young body. You are average height. About 5&#39;11 or so. Your arms are toned with muscle and have a slight layer of brown hair running across them. It matches the swept back brown hair atop your head. You&#39;re wearing a green jersey repping the college you attend and some plain blue jeans. You&#39;re wearing some traditional black Converse shoes on your feet. Your name is Steven. <br />
<br />
You then look over at Michelle. You&#39;ve known her since you were children. She lived beside your grandmother&#39;s house the town over, and you always played together as you grew up, but you eventually lost touch with each other. When you&#39;d finally been admitted to college, you sat right next to her in class and didn&#39;t even notice each other until your professor called her name. Your jaw dropped as you realized it was her. She was completely different. She had short, dyed black hair with a pink streak on the bangs, swept out of her face. Her hair had always been blonde and her appearance utterly innocent. But now, she looked rather...punky. She was still as thin as ever. She couldn&#39;t have been more that 120 lbs. Her green eyes struck you as she looked over at you as she recognized you in return. Her jaw dropped!<br />
<br />
You had stared at each other in shock as you eyes each other up and down, taking in each others appearance. In comparison you seemed bland and boring. Her small breasts were hidden beneath a black T shirt and under that was a red-and-black striped shirt. There were various pins all over her bag and her jeans were tattered to shreds. You quickly became friends once again.<br />
<br />
She looked much like that today, with the exception that her hair was now a little longer. You grinned as you remembered the event fondly, before the announcer began to speak again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay people!&quot; He said. He was a pompous, short man. He wore a black suit and dark aviator styled shades to hide his squinty little eyes. He oozed sleaziness. <br />
<br />
He eyed the crowd of about 50 or so competitors. &quot;Today we begin our quarterly Scavenger Hunt! This year, we&#39;ve rented out an enormous military base, thanks to the US Government! It&#39;s a huge site, so there&#39;s lots of room for you all to crawl around in! Also, it appears we&#39;ve got a lot of people here today who don&#39;t know the rules! So, I&#39;m gonna need a volunteer!&quot;<br />
<br />
He scanned the crowd once more and pointed at someone in front of you. &quot;You!&quot; He called, &quot;Come here!&quot;  <br />
<br />
A short black girl, wearing a white blouse and a black skirt got up on stage and gave a meek wave at everyone else. Her long straight black hair was pulled into a large braid behind her and she had a very mousy look to her features. &quot;Tell them your name!&quot; the host told her. He held the microphone in front of her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Carrie...&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
The host stood behind her as he said &quot;Tell them some more!&quot; The announcer slid a disposable glove over his right hand as she nervously spoke about her hometown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Carrie. Very nice to meet you.&quot; He said, holding out his gloved hand. There was something in it, and the crowd began to stir just as she grasped it with her own slender hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; she reeled. &quot;What was that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You could see her hand was covered in a blue liquid but before she could do anything about it, it had quickly absorbed into her skin. She shrieked as it disappeared.<br />
<br />
Everyone watched with bated breath. The host smiled and turned back to the audience, &quot;Pay attention folks!&quot; <br />
<br />
His direction to Carrie was altogether unnecessary however, due to her sudden screaming as she lifted up her blouse and revealed that her stomach had pushed out from her body slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel it!&quot; she screamed. Her breasts began to bloat above her expanding stomach as you and Michelle watch her blouse constrict around her. The change continued as the crowd rustled uncomfortably and the small black girl on stage began to clearly become pregnant. Her bra snapped in the back as her breasts pushed up a cup size, and her belly became taut and firm within her clawing hands. When it was finished Carrie was pouring tears and her now pregnant tummy protruded alarmingly out at about the 7 month point. <br />
<br />
Michelle fidgeted uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Carrie.&quot; the host grinned as she wept and fel to her knees. Perhaps that was not her ideal change. &quot;Is it a boy or a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
He host laughed at his own joked and pulled a red packet out of his suit pocket. &quot;Oh relax,&quot; He said, as he slapped it onto her bowed head. <br />
<br />
Immediately her belly began to recede back within her and her breasts retreated back into their former selves. Carrie began to calm down and wiped her eyes as she leaned back and watched with exhausted curiosity. After a few moments she was back to her former self and lifted herself up off the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine. Thanks!&quot; The host said as he swatted her backside. She jumped and scurried back down off the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, as I have demonstrated here, THIS...&quot; He produced another blue pack from his pocket, &quot;...is our world famous TransPack! You get hit with one of these, and you can expect the unexpected! Our bioengineering team works tirelessly to bring you the most bizarre things you could imagine within them. We&#39;ve had people end up as thing we couldn&#39;t even rightly classify!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down at Carrie and said &quot;They put a mild one aside for that display,&quot; and winked. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are 2 other colors!&quot; He continued, &quot;The red pack will undo your most recent change! The green pack will be MUCH harder to find and will completely restore you to normal!.&quot; He paused. &quot;...And of course, my friends, this will all be televised on national television!&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle cursed at him. You looked back at the bus you were dropped off in and wondered if it was too late to leave now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry friends!&quot; The host said with a grin, &quot;It&#39;s too late to leave now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Figures.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will each be provided with a bag. You can store your TransPack pods in it. You do not have to work in pairs. You may split up or you may even form a temporary alliance with another team. We don&#39;t really care! Just keep the good stuff coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd began to move towards him as a strange looking man brought out a container full of the bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will also each be given 1 TransPack of each color. One blue. One red. One green. Don&#39;t waste em!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now get out there and get changin&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
You follow Michelle up through the line and receive your bag from the assistant. You glare at the host as he guffaws into his phone. He catches your glare and winks. There&#39;s something not right about that guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s always been like that. Just ignore it.&quot; Michelle said. She grabs your attention by yanking at the bag over your shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;So where should we go first!?&quot; Michelle asks. She&#39;s obviously excited about this. You wonder if she actually realizes the consequences of losing. You only signed up because you have a deep fetishism for transformation tucked away in your private thoughts. You also have a deep infatuation with Michelle since you&#39;ve rekindled your friendship. It was win-win in your books. <br />
<br />
You scratch your head and say, &quot;I don&#39;t know! You pick!&quot;</p>
