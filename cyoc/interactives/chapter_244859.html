<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, given the wording of Susan’s transformation, particularly the part where Kyle stipulated that the fertility experiment’s effects would be passed down to her children, Jennifer was about to undergo a radical transformation herself. A transformation not just to her body, but also to her history and memories!<br />
<br />
Jennifer watched in terror as her own breasts suddenly expanded to match her mother’s, ripping her cheerleading top to shreds and replacing it with a dorky t-shirt of her own, depicting the main characters of Sailor Moon. Her ass and hips widened and thickened to match, her uniform’s skirt getting replaced by a frilly blue one. And just like her mom, Jenny’s panties blew up into a thick and squishy disposable diaper, hers being bright pink and printed with images of Amy Rose the Hedgehog. As if to complete this so called ensemble, she was suddenly wearing chunky red sneakers with white knee socks, a pair of pink-rimmed reading glasses, and her hair was pulled into a pair of loose pigtails. Her stomach gurgled, and her midsection lost its muscle definition to be replaced with a doughy little belly, completing her transformation into a form to match her new mother’s.<br />
<br />
Jenny went walleyed as her brain melted down and remolded around the memories of her new history. Her retroactively altered life flashed before her eyes as she slowly came to. Apparently being raised by a slow-witted, barely continent, hyper fertile virgin like Susan had a sort of adverse effect on Jenny’s upbringing. In fact half the reason why Susan hired their maid Martha was because she desperately needed help raising her daughter. That said, even though the maid helped toilet train her, Jenny had inherited her mother’s scatterbrained tendency to forget how to hold herself sometimes, hence the diapers. Luckily Jenny didn’t inherit all of her mother’s intelligence values, and was actually able to get through school without being held back. She was a C student for the most part but at least she’s still smarter-er than her dropout mother.<br />
<br />
Just like her mother, Jennifer also had a hair-trigger eroginous system, and would accidentally orgasm at the slightest provocation. Usually she’d cum from the feeling of her plump nipples rubbing on the inside of her bra or shirts, her clit being tickled by the cottony material of her adult diaper (custom printed with her favorite nerd culture characters of course), or even just from getting excited about a thing she likes. Just like her mother, Jennifer had grown up loving everything to do with comic books, trading cards, collectible toys, board games, video games, cartoons and anime, and well… basically anything nerd related. Of course while her mother’s tastes tend to lean more toward western nerd culture like Star Wars and Justice League, Jenny wound up being more like a weeaboo and leaned toward stuff like Sailor Moon and My Hero Academia.<br />
<br />
That’s nearly where the similarities between this New Jenny and her New mother Susan ended though. Where Susan was a complete virgin who barely knew what sex even was, never masturbated or watch a second of porn, and had never gone on any sort of date, Jenny was really quite the opposite. Despite being a big, fat, diaper wearing nerd like her mom, Jenny’s reputation as one of “the popular kids” at school has preserved in this altered world. Of course, she wasn’t on the cheerleading team anymore, and neither were her old teammates. No, just like Jenny, her friends were also huge nerds, and together they had a tabletop gaming club instead. Also, just like in the old world, Jenny was still dating the captain of the football team, and she still had a relatively active sex life. Very active as it turned out, because even though she wore diapers all the time she was still getting all kinds of action, earning her the title of one of the class sluts. Of course, one thing Jenny did inherit from her mother was that weird hyper fertility she got as a result of that experimental program, so she almost never left the house without a few condoms.<br />
<br />
To summarize, Jenny was a hyper-sexualized, diaper wearing, nerdy slut.<br />
<br />
Jennifer shook herself out of her memory rearranging trance and steadied herself. She was operating on two timelines’ worth of memories, and she could remember that her mother got cursed by that petty jerk Kyle whom she and her friends from D&D group had pantsed in front of everyone in the hall. So now in this new identity she decided to try to do something about it. She would try to help her mother navigate her new… existence was the best way to put it. Would that be a good way to get revenge on him for messing with her mom? She hoped so.<br />
<br />
“Jenny?” Susan looked at her daughter like a lost puppy, “Have you seen Martha today? I just messed myself and I need to get to the comic book store.”<br />
<br />
“Today is Martha’s day off, remember?” Jennifer patiently reminded her mother, “I can help change you instead.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, was that today?” Susan scratched her chin, “I forgot if she mentioned that. I was gonna ask her if she wanted to take a tour of my Bat Cave! Ooh, so you know how Batman and Superman both had moms named Martha? That’s why I chose her to be our maid! I just thought that was so… ~uhhn~… so cool~!” She’d orgasmed again.<br />
<br />
“Huh, that actually is pretty cool,” Jenny supposed, “Anyway, I can totally change your diaper instead though. In fact, I wanna come with you to the comic shop today. You know, have a little mommy and daughter time?”<br />
<br />
“Golly! You wanna come with me to work?” Susan gasped, “I would love that! In fact, I think today we’re getting some new products to sell. I could pick you out something cool?”<br />
<br />
“I’d love that,” Jenny smiled.</p>
