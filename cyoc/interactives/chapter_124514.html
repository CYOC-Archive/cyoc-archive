<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door cracks open and a girl, probably a freshman, grabs a cheer cone and announces the next suitor. &quot;Presenting Derek Freedman for your Majesty&#39;s progeny.&quot; Oh thank God it&#39;s Derek. I don&#39;t think I could handle another stranger being forced on me right now. Not that I&#39;ll have any choice once he&#39;s... finished. But fot now, it&#39;ll be good to see a friendly face.<br />
<br />
Derek strides down the court eagerly eyes on me the whole time. I hold my arms out to him to welcome him back. &quot;Oh Derek I missed you. It was horrible. It was like I couldn&#39;t...&quot; But he isn&#39;t responding. Derek&#39;s eyes remain on target and if anything he marches faster towards my chair. &quot;Derek?... Baby? Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is wrong. I only need to mate.&quot; Derek unbuckles his belt and undoes his jeans, leaving his underwear exposing his steel erection. What the hell is he talking about? Why is he so animal all of a sudden? He makes it to my magic chair and grabs me by the arms. &quot;This morning I held back so much. I could have given you many children right then. But I followed the hive law and waited. And waited. And waited. But no more. You will be mine like you once were.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulls down his jeans and briefs in one hard swoop and exposes his mighty staff. If he wasn&#39;t scaring me with how rough he was being, I would be seriously enjoying seeing my favorite little soldier. Derek climbs on top of me and puts one of his marble, muscley arms above my head on the chair and leans down into my face. He looks over my sweating chest and takes a deep breath of my cursed musk. His eyes look wild. &quot;I was going to be the one to knock you up. I would be the football star.&quot; He lines up his dick to me and plants his feet square on the ground. &quot;And you would be my wife and you would get pregnant any chance I got.&quot; I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s saying all of this. Derek has always been so sensitive and sweet, to hear him so openly say he wanted knock me up is sort of shocking. And sort of sexy. Derek&#39;s aggression is starting to be more hot than scary and I&#39;m getting into it. &quot;I held back every time you got me into your bed and to do the right thing and get those damn condoms on. I would&#39;ve rather just split these fucking legs open and fuck you till you got morning sickness. Women with big bellies are so god damn sexy. And you would&#39;ve been all mine.&quot; Now I don&#39;t have the energy to even speak. The curse has me so ramped up I can barely catch my breath. I slide my hands under his shirt and grab at every bulging muscle on down his body and pray for him to just end it already. &quot;But what&#39;s done is done. And he&#39;ll never have this.&quot; Derek drives his dick deep into me and starts sucking on my neck. &quot;I was fucking made for you, my Queen. And now I get to do what I&#39;ve always wanted to do.&quot; He only pumps inside me three times before he completely unloads himself into me, no restraint, no pullout, and definitely no condoms. He&#39;s never been so quick before and I&#39;ve never felt his hot sticky semen inside me. He was always so shy when I would blow him that he would rather it spray onto the ground than in my mouth. But I guess he doesn&#39;t have to hold back anymore.<br />
<br />
Derek holds himself above my body as the last of him trickles down my leg. He chuckles  I holds his other hand up to his face. &quot;What is it Derek?&quot; I ask finally able to compose a solid sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve waited so long to do that. And it went by so fast. Did it... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to wait and see. And it was the fastest I&#39;ve ever had before, but I don&#39;t think I can not enjoy a fuck anymore because of Hive Law.&quot; Derek face saddens and he rolls over to my side and the chair changes into a bed to fit both of us. &quot;But you were definitely better than Lord Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; I nod and Derek pounces on top of me again, kissing me so much it&#39;s almost as if he was ready to go for round two. But then I get a strange tingling heat in my chest that I&#39;ve felt only twice before. I tap Derek quickly on his back. &quot;Derek, Derek!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
I point to my breasts and squeal &quot;Watch!&quot; as once again, my breasts grow even bigger, now the size of kickballs. Derek&#39;s eyes light up. &quot;Does that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...We&#39;re pregnant!&quot; Derek and I wrap our arms around each other, super excited to finally start our family. I almost even forget what got us in this situation in the first place. <br />
<br />
Then the young freshman girl from before who announced Derek walks up to our golden bed and bows to me. &quot;Excuse me your Majesty, but you have successfully mated with this one. Shall I send for the next one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Next one? But I have Derek over right now, Miss?..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shelby, your Majesty. And it is your duty to see every male suitor who comes to mate with you. Unless you require maintenance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maintenance? I&#39;m pregnant, not a car. Derek what does she mean?&quot; I look over to my boyfriend, who I severely need to be by my side through all of this mess. But he has straightened up as has the hypnotized look in his eyes like before. The curse has taken over his mind once again. &quot;My Queen, as a common drone, it is my honor to mate with you and then spend your pregnancy in your direct service. Maintenance simply means to take care of your every need, such as food or bathing. Now where will you need me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean &#39;where&#39;? I need you here by my side. There will be plenty of drones to take care of the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wherever you wish me to be, Your Majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then that&#39;s settled.&quot; I turn back to Shelby. &quot;You hear that? Derek Freedman here is going to stay with me as my personal companion, lover, spouse, whatever. Announce that to the Hive.&quot; Shelby bows and leaves to go do just that. But before she leaves I shout &quot;And bring us some food! Lots of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The gym door slams shut as she scurries out leaving me alone with Derek once again. I blow some of hair out his beautiful face and caress his cheek. He blinks a few times and the curse&#39;s magic lifts from his eye&#39;s and I see my Derek again. &quot;Jenny...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa what happened to &#39;Your Majesty&#39;?&quot; I poke him on the nose and he smiles. &quot;I love for this, but you know you will have to mate with someone else sooner or later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssh. Let&#39;s not think about that now. Just hold me. I got my prince back.&quot; He kisses my head and he tries. With such big breasts, it&#39;s a little tricky trying to find a position that works and is comfortable for the both of us. We end up with me laying on top of him, my back to his chest, and his hands on top of my boobs with him leaning against the headboard of our magic golden bed. He just holds me quietly for a while until someone barges into the gym and disrupts our moment.</p>
