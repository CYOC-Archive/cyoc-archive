<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Steve placed the phone back down as he went back to his computer is when he gets a crazy idea from it that he quietly searches the site while looking for something to what he was searching for, unaware of Steve&#39;s human life was no longer his own any more than to the one Steve was about to receive. Veiwing at the computer screen more that there were things like piercing, a butt plug to go up his scalely hind ass, even a nice dildo to play around with as he already has his very own cock to worry about in the slightest as shortly after clicked on something by accident. once he did this, Steve was back into his own clothes that there was even a cut open hole for his newly formed reptilian tail for it.<br />
<br />
Touching as Steve was feeling his arms is when he jumped off of the chair while examining his clothing that he was now wearing. &quot;What the? This is getting worse! I have to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Steve sat back down as he was sitting right on his reptilian tail that Steve didn&#39;t care about it, excessively since he slipped his tail into the position right between his legs. still looking for away to change his life back around that he shortly found something about translation. &quot;What dose. . . Translate &quot;skinks:forktounge&quot;? What&#39;s translate &quot;skinks:forktounge&quot;? Maybe to translate this site into English.&quot;<br />
<br />
After clicking on it that Steve was unaware again on what was happening for his eyes sparked white as the sparks soon enough faded. His eyes wondered around while thinking on if it did anything at all, yet when Steve took a quick glimpse of his window from his room that he shortly after looked back at the computer as he was now blushing red from the site of his window for he was very much now seeming to be in love with the out doors while wondering what lies Beyond so even more then usual. &quot;Am I speaking in skinks:forktounge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t know skinks:forktounge! Yet i&#39;m speaking it, yes?&quot; Steve said to himself as he shortly after tested it out to see if he was actually speaking this new language, little to unknown from Steve that to everyone else who hears him now sounds like he&#39;s speaking English when Steve was not for he later calls this strange forktounge of his language to just simply skinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only know English!&quot; Steve argued to himself while feeling frustrated about it. looking around his room that he shortly after spotted his mirror as he wondered how to say what he was looking at in his reflection to English. However, what came out of his reptilian muzzle was &quot;mohawk&quot; with a bit of confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s not right.&quot; Steve said while looking back at his computer, though he did thought that he&#39;d looked awkward with the way he was dressed in his clothing. Still searching around with his eyes now that a strange thought came to be as he was now fearing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t remember!&quot; Steve said as he then looked around his room. With a thought of giving this new skinks language a try that he decided to test it out with the mirror first, even if it sounds like a human speaking on a slow and deep voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mirror. bed. computer. door. top. lizard-mam.&quot; Steve said as this dose somehow confirms him that he was speaking the skinks language.<br />
<br />
Steve slapped his reptilian legs together with scaled hands a couple of times in denial, but it just only puts shocks of erection into his thighs as his dick was showing a bit of a bulging grip withinhis pants. &quot;No! No...no...no! I am not a lizard-man! I am human! and this website had better fix this right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Scrolling through the page he was at is when that he soon clicked on it. once done as he jumped a bit, his clothes were changed into a tuxedo outfit that people wear at work. &quot;An outfit?&quot;<br />
<br />
With Steve examining to what he was wearing, he felt a little angry about trying this website at himself. &quot;really?! Ga, What else can be worse then this? I totally look like a business man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making his second attempt to go for it changes his outfit into a black, latex, speedo swimming shorts. if Steve wasn&#39;t shock about this outfit change before, he sure was now as he almost literately let out a scream when he jumped. &quot;Ohhhhhhhh, no, no,no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is really bad! I&#39;ve got to fix this!&quot; Steve said while figuring out on what to do with this next that like always, the third times was the charm as he was now wearing a heavy metal rock band outfit. The outfit contains a black leather jean with tethered chains by the belt, a leather jacket, and this also came with an electric guitar that was hooked up to a cord as it was strapped on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is better. well that&#39;s a step closer in the right direction...&quot; Steve said as he toyed with his new outfit a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m still not human!&quot; He said that to some out there would be almost happy about the outfit and simply just walk away with it, even if they don&#39;t want to turn back on being human. However, Steve didn&#39;t as he clicked on it yet once more as he was now left with nothing on. There was Not even a small cloth of clothing in which Steve calls a loincloth to cover up his crotch area, yet he didn&#39;t need to right now for he was shocked to see his naked body with only his scales to show off now was embarrassing to let any girl see. Now he was getting annoyed by this strange outfit change that was going on here, even if he&#39;s not wearing anything at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ga, Not this again?!&quot; Steve said. feeling frustrated about it even more as he got up off of his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;At this rate i&#39;ll end up dressed like some cosplay character next.&quot; Sighing with not taking this anymore that he sits back down on his chair, this time to move his tail out of the way and to the side. Unaware for Steve that this would be his last time to sit off of the chair from within his own room, while seeing his computer screen more while finding his way out of this troubled time of a mess in which he was now in ever again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What other choices do I have on this site?&quot; Steve said while scrolling on the webpage. Soon enough though, his eyes light up with hope when something caught his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this? Upgrade your temporary membership to a FULL lifetime membership...&quot; Steve said while reading it out loud for it was about Terms and Conditions. &quot;...to enjoy all the benefitsof this site.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Steve said while sounding happy about something. &quot;Once I have full membership that I can undo all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TERMS. Bla..bla..bla..bla.&quot;reading the terms while skipping a bunch of paragraphs on the page that when it came up on do you agree to these terms is where Steve was hoping it will accept and undo everything to what he has done and also hope it would work, to help turn him back to being human again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I agree? yes...please.&quot; was all Steve has said for he then quickly pressed the enter key, but as he did this though is when Steve was blinded by a bright light from the screen that Steve quickly covered his eyes from it while feeling a strange pull.<br />
<br />
The light was so bright now that it was like it was suddenly pulling Steve into the computer screen itself as he shortly after blacks out from the computer, while leaving behind a message of Steve who was still a reptilian lizard-man. &quot;Hello, my name is Steve. I&#39;m now a lizard-man as this will be my last time on being human while awaiting to start my next journey on my new life ahead of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the message as he was somewhat under an auto line speach, he frantically searches to his left and right while worrying on what was going on with the thought of what he just said through his speech message. &quot;No... I don&#39;t want to be a lizard-man! And I&#39;m not going to start my next journey on my new life ahead of me... there&#39;s been some kind of mistake!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone get me out of here! Ahhhhhh!!!!!!&quot;Steve said as he sreamed, before his picture freeze framed him on the webpage, unable to know what awaits for him. With his now on the page that on the screen were now ten as his was the sixth picture, the bottom left hand corner of a two row with five on top.<br />
<br />
Over time, each of the photos that were shown has started his or her new journey upon their new life. Some of which were now in another world as it started off with the eighth picture that it then followed it off by the first picture. It was some time after for it was soon Steve, the lizard-man&#39;s turn as it first showed off from the screen computer of saying from the words &#39;online&#39; that it later shifted to say &#39;to begin a new life&#39;.<br />
<br />
Else where, someone was tapping onto Steve&#39;s character from another computer screen one owns and started the settings. once finished, Steve felt conscious enough to know that he was about to start his new life long journey in another world. It was like someone was playing the role of god as Steve was about to be sent there without knowing what his new journey was, or if it was possible for him to ever go back.<br />
<br />
For now though, Steve had to keep this thing about him being from another world a secret from anybody he will encounter. Unless, he finds someone else who was sent there from his world. Yeah, like that’sever going to happen as it was a one in a million change of this happening for Steve was still basically out cold from this.<br />
<br />
When he started to stir, Steve later awoke as he slowly was up. Once up as it was like getting hit by something hard on the head that his vision was soon clear, clear enough to see around for he was waking up to an unfamiliar area. This strange new room seems to be a four wall room with lights coming out of the window, or at least he thinks it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah..., Damn! what happened?... wait, what&#39;s going on here? Oh shit! where am I? what am I doing here? I need to get out of...&quot; Steve said while panicking as this was freaking him out about this that it continued to build up.<br />
<br />
wondering as to how he got there in the first place that his glimpse caught his retraction from the water near by as he was still a lizard-man, at least wearing a bit of some clothes. Steve Eventually did find something was wrong here, while collapsing to his knees in defeat and suffering. he wasn&#39;t alone here ether as there were others here too. &quot;well, it&#39;s official. not even My own family would recognize me like this now. not even if they would know that this is me now, but dose everyone else here even know it&#39;s really me? if so, then who&#39;s life did I change life with?&quot; Steve said to himself.<br />
<br />
Thoughts flooded as one came to be on to whom he was called now while also thinking about home. if he was here in this anthro lizard body, then who&#39;s in his body? These and more were popping up in his head that all he knew was his old life was over, and this was his new life now. the question was, where is he?<br />
noticed that Steve was at,...</p>
