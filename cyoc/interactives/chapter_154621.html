<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James came skidding to a halt, horse cock and breasts flopping all over the place, as the naked form of his mother turned. She spun to reveal a modicum of surprise, but with an intensity to her look that made James shiver. Naked as he was she stood, not 5 feet from him, breasts hanging, nipples hard. James&#39;s mind thought, &#39;They&#39;re as big as mine&#39;. With a glance down he took in the rest of his mother. Her chubby cock, poked erect from between her heavy crotch-tits, and his stomach did butterflies at the sight of the long thin trickle of pre-cum dribbling from it. He wanted that penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&quot;. He said in a level tone, by way of greeting. The corner of Joan&#39;s mouth ticked up for a fraction of a second as she replied in an equally flat tone, &quot;James...&quot;.<br />
<br />
A long pause stretched between the two naked people. In the silence, James&#39;s ears twitched, picking up the sound of a muffled cry. &quot;What&#39;s happening in there?&quot; He asked, inquisitively. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing important.&quot; Joan replied, quickly but confidently. James accepted the answer. He could extrapolate. He wasn&#39;t stupid. He&#39;d seen Jess fawn over their father. Seen her eye him, biting her lip when no-one looked. If they were fucking in there... and Joan wasn&#39;t stopping it then... She must be okay with it... Then maybe?<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted as Joan spoke up, pointing at his hooves. &quot;Are they working?&quot;. <br />
<br />
James nodded, &quot;Very well. I like them. Thank you!&quot;. James blinked, had he just thanked his mother for sucking him off to give him hoof feet?<br />
<br />
He had, and he meant it too. He was beginning to feel incredibly candid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome... I&#39;ll tell you a secret James. I love mine.&quot; Joan grinned twirling one hoof foot at him, making her erect cock wobble enticingly. <br />
<br />
&#39;Mom likes this too. Can&#39;t be too bad so. Kinda. Kinda like some of these changes&#39;. James thought. He really wanted to share. He got his opportunity as Joan pointed at his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;These are new...&quot; She let the statement hang as she stepped forward, closing the gap, licking her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just got them today...&quot; James said. His mind screamed to tell his mother what happened. To admit everything. How unbelievable it felt. How much better it was to fuck a donkey than a human. Melissa... She was nothing compared to how Dakota felt when he was inside her, and how it would surely feel to have her inside him. Melissa was nothing...<br />
<br />
As if reading his mind, Joan simply asked, &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucked a Donkey...&quot; He said, proudly. Joan&#39;s eyebrow raised at his tone. &quot;You liked it?&quot; She asked, incredulously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Best fuck I ever had Mom. It&#39;s like nothing else. Horses have it soooo good if that&#39;s what sex is like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan shivered. The thought of her fucking a goat, or her being fucked by a goat had crossed her mind many, many times in the past few weeks; but it had always been in the context of her and Henry devolving together. The voice returned. &quot;Join us!&quot;. It rumbled. The call of the forest. Joan felt it strongly now.<br />
<br />
James continued. &quot;Feels amazing Mom, really, if you see a goat you should defo...&quot; That small rational part of James&#39;s mind stopped before he advised his mother to fuck a goat; but Joan picked it up anyway. She sniffed loudly then stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can smell her...&quot;. She could, her tingling mouth and nose picked up the musty scent of pussy. Different to her own, old or new, different to Jess&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your face!&quot; James exclaimed pointing. He could see it now, her mouth was a little pinched, a small bit pointing jutting out. The very beginnings of a muzzle. It&#39;d been there again, thretening to grow ever since she began looking in the window.<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s hand brushed her lips, excited, then returned to her side. &quot;My next change... Know what yours will be?&quot;.<br />
<br />
James shook his head. Joan&#39;s hand snaked out to rub the fascinatingly black areola and nipples, watching as they puckered and hardened. &quot;Want to find out?&quot; She whispered. A whisper punctuated by another moan from inside the house.<br />
<br />
James&#39;s cock jumped, at the sensations. &quot;Okay... let&#39;s find out.&quot; He breathed. His mind said &#39;Please.&#39;.<br />
<br />
James watched as his mother, slowly and carefully got to her knees, using her hands to slowly and tenderly pull her breasts apart.<br />
<br />
Getting the message James took his hardening monster and plopped it with a *plap* against Joan&#39;s chest. She quickly enveloped it in her bosom. It felt warm to James, and nice, but nothing like what he had felt before.<br />
<br />
Joan, in close proximity, could now smell clearly, the heady smell of donkey sex. It was nauseatingly seductive. As her body began gyrating up and down the shaft her tongue snaked out to take a long lick along it&#39;s length. It tasted earthy... good.<br />
<br />
James moaned in delight, watching his mother gyrate up and down, shaft now completely hard. Again his mind said. &#39;Please. Please oh please.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where does it tingle James?&quot; She asked. His initial obvious response was to point at his cock. Then. &#39;Oh please...&#39; It tingled somewhere else.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh please. Oh god please!&#39; His heart lept into his throat as his hand shot to the source. Feeling down under his taint.<br />
<br />
&#39;Please oh God yes! Please!&#39; It felt damp, and slightly mushy. Slick almost. His mind screamed in triumph. &#39;Yes! Yes! Oh God Yes!&#39;. This was his ticket to letting Dakota fuck him.<br />
<br />
&quot;James?&quot; Joan asked as he left out a happy sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what it is Mom...&quot;, with a flourish he pulled his hand up and thrust it into his mother&#39;s swollen face. He watched as her eyes flickered, inhaling deeply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Dakota can fuck me.&quot; Joan&#39;s eyes opened, confused. &quot;Dakota? I thought Melissa was your girlfriend? Who&#39;s Dakota?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Donkey Mom!&quot; He pulled back, taking his cock and franticly beginning to pump. His stomach was doing excited summersaults.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mom! Gotta go!&quot; He called, retreating along the clearing, still frantically pumping his cock. Nothing was going to stop him now.</p>
