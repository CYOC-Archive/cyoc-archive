<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The processing has been complete. Please take a moment and get dressed before heading out. There will be an orientation later this week, and information has been preloaded into your new phone.&quot; A voice said following Ashley&#39;s shriek.<br />
<br />
She paused for maybe a half second hearing the voice before she continued to touched her crotch, sides, and chest. she turned looking at her pert butt in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-what... this... this can&#39;t... it can&#39;t... it... it can&#39;t...&quot; she kept saying to herself unable to accept or process what just happened to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss please save exploring for when you are at home. You have 5 minutes to get dressed and head out before you will be assisted.&quot; a voice called out making Ashley look up and around crossing her arms over her chest starting to feel exposed as a half naked girl for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what did you do.... what did you do!?&quot; she screamed out starting to cry even feeling overwhelmed at this all. She would suddenly feel a cold chill that made her giggle down her back as she jumped. She started to wipe her tears as it broke her out of the hysterical path she was about to go down.<br />
<br />
After standing there calling out for help or answers a door suddenly and in walked three men. They were all wearing black speedos and sunglasses. Their bodies and looks amazing all completely ripped and kind of perfect with handsome faces. One was black, one was white, and one was Asian, but they all seemed to have the same exact build somehow and even looked handsome in an almost related way. They moved closet to Ashley and she moved away before having her arms grabbed. The men didn&#39;t say anything to her as the voice called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Failure to comply has resulted in discipline action.&quot; one of the men started to lean in like he was about to kiss her when suddenly there was a clicking of heels and a calm voice called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough.&quot; the men stopped and moved over to the edge of the room.<br />
<br />
A woman entered who was possibly the most beautiful woman Ashley had ever seen in their life even including the internet. She seemed to be an average height, but was looking really tall right now to Ashley with the 5&quot; black heels she wore. Her outfit was a very tight sleeveless black dress that hugged her body all the way down to just below her knees. Her body was really curvy and sexy, but besides that she was really fit. Her arms and legs had noticeable muscles and even some abs were teased in her tight tress. She had the sort of body you&#39;d expect to see on a fitness model. Something similar to Alyssa Loughran or Renne Enos which were two of the only fitness models Ashley knew from of since they were buff but still pretty thicc and sexy. Her face was stunning with full painted red lips and her eye&#39;s were a dark brown done up with make up in a nice professional but sexy way. Her skin was a tan olive color that looked flawless except for the beauty mark on her cheek. Her features were clearly mediterranean. Her look was finished with a short almost futuristic haircut cut just above her shoulders with an angled hair line. She was holding a tablet with a stylist as she tabbed away before starting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... Ashley Chase... wasn&#39;t expecting to have an issue with one of the towns VIPs again so soon.&quot; she said with a sigh. Ashley was shaking a bit looking to her and then the men after what nearly just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What-&quot; she started before tapped on her tablet and Ashley felt a painful jolt for a moment. The woman glared at her with a smug look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know. When ever we need to do anything beyond a tickle or chill it actually cost our company a bit of money.&quot; she said sounding kind of annoyed even though she was the one who just ordered the shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now its not the first time we&#39;ve had issues with VIPs but usually it takes longer then the damn processing room. What&#39;s the issue? If possible we try to keep VIP families in tact which is a lot more then a lot of people get when they go through the processing? Says here there is a standard husband, wife, son and daughter.&quot; she looked up checking Ashley&#39;s tight little body out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so ungrateful you look great.&quot; she told her putting a hand on her hip. Ashley looked down at their new self and considered what she said about the family having a son and daughter. Was this a mix up? Was this body for his sister? How was this shit even possible!? She thought to herself before starting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-there must have been a mistake. I&#39;m actually a bo-&quot; she started as the woman raised her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there. Our city runs on the most advanced algorithm ever created. This absolutely is what you are meant to be. The only place for error would be when information was being filled out upfront, but Elizabeth has no notes here about errors and she knows better to make mistakes. If you were the brother before then It&#39;s probably likely our system thought your sister would make a better brother.&quot; she told them with a kind of smug expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but... but....&quot; Ashley tried to argue as the woman got much closer looking down at the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Even if we did reprocess you we don&#39;t do that unless we find we can&#39;t train you. It&#39;s not like this process is free and easy... there are bottom lines and stuff.&quot; she said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus... even when we do reprocess people on those rare occasions it&#39;s not like we exactly have full control over how it turns out... more like we have... suggestions.&quot; she shrugged before rubbing her chin looking her over and grabbing Ashley&#39;s face with her strong hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... tweaks are another thing...&quot; she looked thoughtful as she stared at Ashely&#39;s ears a moment before releasing her. Ashley stood there clearly intimidated for a movement twisting her hands before asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I can&#39;t stay like this... w-what about college and my friends and my life... im... im a man!&quot; she said starting to tear up. The woman sighed and shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;So little girl... you want to try your luck getting processed again huh?&quot; she then smirked tapping at her tablet and showing it to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see this woman?&quot; The screen showing a gorgeous fake bimbo looking woman in her late 30s with tanned skin and dyed hair in a tight green dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was one of the towns VIPs just like you... maybe a year or two younger... she was marked down as a problematic after she kept trying to get away from this town and get off to college. It was a real shame to we had turned him into such a big strong jock, but they just couldn&#39;t behave....&quot; she smirked a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;But as you can see after just one reprocessing she has finally found a role she can get into.&quot; she said swapping to the side showing a clip of the woman giving a lap dance to her husband who looked to be in his 40s. Ashley turned kind of pale looking to the screen turning a bit red and then up to the woman&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you can&#39;t-&quot; she managed to stutter out before the woman simple responded with.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can.&quot; she then swiped it to the side, and the screen showed a dog, a cow, and a squirrel all with names below them that sounded like people names.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you REALLY don&#39;t want to know what happens if you keep wasting the companies money with multiple processing&#39;s.&quot; she said before letting out a bit of a smug laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... you&#39;re going to be a good girl and play your new role right?&quot; she asked her smug expression only seeming to get more smug as she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you bitch!&quot; Ashley snapped out again starting to tear up.<br />
<br />
The woman glared at him and sighed starting to walk away and waving her hand. The men who were in the room started to move closer to Ashley again two of them gripping her shoulders and pushing her down while one of them started to fish around in his speedo right in front of her face. Ashley turned pale struggle knowing what was going to happen starting to call out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! NO! NOOO!&quot; she struggled in vain as the man finally got his massive cock out right in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait... I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;ll be good... I&#39;ll play along!&quot; Ashley started to plead but the woman didn&#39;t stop walking to the door. Just as the man&#39;s big cock flopped right over Ashley&#39;s face she felt an odd jolt run through her as she started to get a bit moist in the crotch. As she started to tear up her head being adjusted as she was about to give this guy a blow job she finally called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait... please please... I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll be a good.. I&#39;ll be a good girl!&quot; she said in desperation. This finally made the woman stop moving ad she snapped her finger and turned around with a smiled on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good.. I was worried this might take a bit longer.&quot; she said moving closer smiling at Ashley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now. I need you to get dressed and get out of here. We have another person to process and you have things on your schedule.&quot; she informed her. Ashley nodded and then suddenly this woman just punched Ashley right in the gut making her fall to her knees as she gasped looking up with tears. The woman smiled down innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Ms Diamond. Never call me a bitch again.&quot; she said in a cheery voice before turning and walking over to the door. The men who were in the room finally left as Ms Diamond stopped to tap a few things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re starting to learn how things work, but... I don&#39;t think after this you should get off free... so...&quot; she pushed a few more buttons and smile before she walked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what are y-&quot; Ashley started as metal arms moved grabbing and covering her ears and stomach before she let out a painful scream again. As the arms pulled away she now had pierced ears and belly button.<br />
<br />
&quot;The processing has been complete. Please take a moment and get dressed before heading out. There will be an orientation later this week, and information has been preloaded into your new phone.&quot; A voice said again. This time Ashley looked over to the clothes tabled and moved to start getting dressed.</p>
