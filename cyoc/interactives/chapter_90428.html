<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin, Ty and Peter were in the hotel lounge when the body swap happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, Ty, listen&quot;, said Ty, now possessed of Peter&#39;s body and powers, &quot;I&#39;ll better go to my room to instruct the jocks&quot;. His plan, of course was to leave Dustin, now with Ty&#39;s body and powers, and Peter, now in Dustin&#39;s body and powerless, alone. This way, Dustin would have room to use and abuse of his new powers on Peter, thinking he was Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!” shouted Peter.<br />
<br />
Ty, however, didn’t Peter say anything, and used his power to ban him from complaining about the body swap or telling about his real identity. It was much easier to use Peter’s power; it seemed there was almost an overabundance of power running through his body, reeling to be used. And, well, the sensation of near omnipotence he got with this simple wish was unbelievable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Dustin?&quot;, said Ty, stopping by the stairs, still amazed.<br />
<br />
Peter tried to talk, even opened his  mouth, but nothing came out. Then, while a grimace of disappointment covered his face, he realised what had happened. &quot;Nothing. It&#39;s not important. Just be gentle&quot;, he answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. When the week is over, everything will be as it was before, only us a few millions richer. By the way, I think we should move to some suites, don&#39;t you? So, Dustin, what about you make the reservations in the desk for tomorrow? Make sure they&#39;re carrying our luggage to the new suites!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What an awesome idea!&quot; Dustin&#39;s face was priceless, but he quickly replied: &quot;If we each have a suite, we should each have a butler, right? So, Peter, make it so each one becomes a servant to one of us for the week&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right&quot;, said Ty. Dustin had turned out to be actually quite smart. Peter knew what Dustin’s plan was, and it was rather clever. Rather clever, indeed.<br />
<br />
As he walked up to his room, he could see Dustin&#39;s and Peter&#39;s conversation in his mind. Dustin was teasing Peter endlessly, but he wasn&#39;t doing anything interesting yet. Well, he’d know it when the party started. In the meantime, he had some work to do with their college frat slaves. It was midnight, so they were partying. Having nothing for them to do, and millions to spend, the three teenagers had allowed them to go party. Ty wished them to be in the room, and, suddenly, they appeared.<br />
<br />
The scene was actually pretty funny. All three were already drunk, if not much, and the change of venue confused them a lot. Riley had definitely been dancing, and he lost his balance and fell to the floor just after appearing. Tom looked like he had been with a girl, because he was now kissing the air. Dylan, in turn, was just pouring some drink on himself, and stank of alcohol. Peter was the first to realise they weren’t in a bar any more: his girl wasn’t there. But soon all three saw who they thought was Peter, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Good evening, lads!” Their stares were foggy, and they did clearly not understand what happened. So Ty quickly wished all alcohol to vanish from their veins. Their reaction was instantaneous: suddenly, all three lost their fuel and fell to the ground, their bodies exhausted from excessive alcohol consumption. Peter read in their minds what it was like: in a few seconds they had gone from party euphoria, to drunken confusion and eventually to horrible hangover.<br />
<br />
“To hell with it!” thought Ty. “They are college frat bastards, they deserve this as punishment. And whatever happens to them this week. The crueller, the better”. He spoke up: “All right, my boys! Your party privileges are revoked. After all, we found some usefulness for your slavery”. He laughed a bit. “We happen to have just won a rather good jackpot in the lottery, and for starters, we have decided to move each to our own suite tomorrow. Anyway, we thought it would be neat having our own butlers, and since you don’t fit the profile, you were brought here to receive some instruction”.<br />
<br />
“I wish you all into proper butler knowledge, such as how to perfectly dress the table, to address visitors, to give advice to your masters and the like”. This time, the power surge was much more powerful. He could literally feel the power going from him to the three frat boys, and transforming into knowledge in their brains. <br />
<br />
What could he add now? He wasn’t an expert on butlers... “Excuse me, sir”, asked Riley all of a sudden. “Maybe you should decide what our uniforms will be”.<br />
<br />
“Great idea, Riley!”, agreed Ty.<br />
<br />
“Uh, sir, if you don’t mind me saying, I think it would be more appropriate if you addressed us by our surnames. I’m Wolverton, myself”. “Mine is Chatterham, sir”, said Tom. “And I am Crookfield, sir”, finally added Dylan. To himself, Peter thought these surnames came in handy for butlers.<br />
<br />
“Well, about uniforms. Taking into account that your college frat bodies are useless for your current tasks, you’ll no longer have muscle. You’ll be skinny, and absolutely unable to gain muscle”, announced Ty. No sooner had he said these words than they started deflating. At first, it was only shoulders and biceps, but a few seconds later traps and delts and lats followed course. Inch by inch, the jocks were less spectacular by the second. They felt less and less stronger. However, they still had pecs and abs and legs. Of course, Ty had made the process deliberately slow in order to relish on the flow of power. First were pecs, getting flatter and flatter. Abs were fast covered by a thin layer of fat. As pecs got completely flat, legs and butt began to downside. At first, all three were wearing basketball shorts that covered their big thighs, but as they got smaller, shorts had nowhere to hold to and fell to the ground. “As a memory of your past glory”, he said with sarcasm, “I’ll allow you to keep your calfs . But you’ll do leg press daily, just before your master is expected to wake up, or otherwise whenever you have free time.”<br />
<br />
The three former jocks were now skinny, so much they were weaklings. They looked down on themselves, disconcerted. “As for uniforms, until and unless your master tells you otherwise, you will be wearing the usual black tailcoat”.  A trio of tailcoats appeared on the bed, each carefully tailored to fit their skinny frames. Even this simple trick made Ty shiver.<br />
<br />
As they began to dress, Riley said, “Pardon, sir, but who is to be allocated to each of you, young masters?”.<br />
<br />
“Actually, we haven’t chosen, yet. But I have done all the hard work instructing you, so I’ll choose right now!”, decided Ty. “I choose...”</p>
