<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Harken's cells were put back together he found that they were in Randi's house. Not only were they at her house but they were in her room. As he looked around he saw Randi's parents standing in the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess congratulations are in order&quot; Mrs. Moss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you passed Harken&quot; Mr. Moss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what are you talking about?&quot; Harken asked trying to feign ignorance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Petunia told us that you passed your hero test&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;I knew you would, you have a heart of gold. You stayed with me yesterday instead of going outside and enjoying the nice day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not Mrs. Glenn&quot; Harken said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're still being so slow Harken&quot; Randi said turning around after feeding Petunia live meal worms. &quot;I guess I'll have to show you. Are you ready Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dear&quot; Mrs. Moss said.<br />
<br />
A few barely audible words came out of Randi's mouth and her mother started to change. Her hair became silvery and wrinkles appeared on her face. Her hands wrinkled too and a few age spots appeared on them. She stooped slightly and her transformation was complete. Harken was shocked to see Mrs. Glenn standing where Mrs. Moss was. She smiled and said &quot;I told you I had a granddaughter who was single.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you are Mrs. Glenn and Mrs. Moss then you lied about that&quot; Harken said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just stretched the truth a little bit&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;She's actually my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course everyone else thinks that she's my grandmother&quot; Randi said. &quot;When we had heard that you were going to volunteer at the home we decided that Mom should be aged so she could keep an eye on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we don't have to do that anymore&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;Randi dear, please return me to my proper age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Mom&quot; Randi said. A few words later and Mrs. Moss was back to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you afraid of becoming twisted using your power like that&quot; Harken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My power is a little different&quot; Randi replied. &quot;It doesn't change me on how I use it. I could turn people into fat slobs just for the fun of it and it won't harm me. At least not in this life. Though I don't really use my power like that so I don't have to worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you have changed yourself&quot; Harken said. &quot;Infel said that I have some memories of you being a boy buried in my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I had to change to a girl when I was nine tracking a magic object that was transforming people&quot; Randi said. &quot;The object turned out to be a girl's swimsuit. When a girl put it on it transformed her into either a life sized doll or a random piece of clothing. The girl's swim coach was using it to provide clothes and dolls for her daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; Harken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since she was guarding it closely I couldn't just take it&quot;<br />
Randi said. &quot;The only way was if she gave it to me to wear and that wasn't going to happen with me as a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't wear it did you?&quot; Harken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did&quot; Randi said. &quot;It turned me into a pair of panties but I only stayed that way for a couple of days. I had cast a spell on myself that would return me to myself after two days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you decide to stay a girl&quot; Harken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked the way I felt as a girl and how my clothes felt&quot; Randi said blushing a bit. &quot;There's been a few times since that I've become a boy again but I always return to being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were shocked when we found out what she could do&quot; Mr. Moss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you find out?&quot; Harken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Shaloonk broke into our house when I was twelve&quot; Randi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a Shaloonk?&quot; Harken asked interrupting.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a solid shadow&quot; Randi said. &quot;It can look like anything depending on what shadow it came from. The one that broke into our house had a human form. It had managed to tie me up before I could do anything. It had also tied Mom and Dad up and it was feeling me and Mom up. Petunia transformed and pulled it off of us. She also untied me so I could kill it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you kill a shadow?&quot; Harken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to surround it in a cocoon of bright white light so it doesn't cast a shadow&quot; Randi said. &quot;You then collapse the cocoon in on itself obliterating the Shaloonk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a terrifying ordeal&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;When I saw Petunia like that I was scared but Randi talked to her after and thanked her for helping out. After our initial shock wore off Randi told us that she could use magic and that she had been born a boy. Since then we've respected her decision to stay a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Randi, I ran into something at the beach&quot; Harken said. &quot;I was wondering if you could tell me what it was. It looked like a shark with fin like legs and an extremely oversized jaw.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that would be a Sharmonsk&quot; Randi said. &quot;They're easy to deal with if you know what your doing. Of course they're hard to track down. It attacks extremely fast and is usually gone by the time someone finds the corpse. Of course it's difficult to know if you have one in the area or not as the people appear to have drowned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I saw a skeleton in the water next to the Sharmonsk&quot; Harken said.<br />
<br />
Randi's eyes went wide and she asked &quot;Are sure about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Harken said. &quot;Didn't the Sharmonsk do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Randi said hanging her head. &quot;A Sharmonsk only eats the souls of it's victims. It's likely that there's a Laamurse out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a Laamurse?&quot; Harkin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a snake like creature&quot; Randi said. &quot;It has tentacles around it's mouth that it uses to drag it's prey in. It digests everything except bones which it expels out covered in a thin membrane which keeps the skeleton intact. It's the only creature that I know of that does that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it sounds like you two have a job to do&quot; Mr. Moss said. &quot;You better get to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right Dad&quot; Randi said. &quot;Let's go Harken. We'll need to go on foot as I'm sure there are people there by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; Harken said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll go with you two&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;We both have the day off and it would be nice to have a family outing today. We'll have to stop by your house so you can get your swimsuit Harken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll use my magic to change into a pair of swim trunks&quot; Harken said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to do that&quot; Randi said looking in one of her dresser drawers. &quot;With you it could come back and bite you if you don't have a reason. Even if it didn't using magic too much drains you and that will leave defenseless when you don't want to be. Now where did that bikini go? Ah, here it is. Harken, could you please leave while I change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harken went down to the living room while Randi changed. Soon she was coming down the stairs wearing the same shirt and skirt she was before but could see the neck strap of a bikini top. She was carrying her oversized beach bag. She reached him and said &quot;Mom and Dad will be down in a minute. This creature we're going to try and destroy is powerful. It's fast and merciless. Once it has you in it's tentacles there's almost no escape.&quot; She then did something unexpected, she kissed him.<br />
<br />
Harken was surprised at first but quickly returned the kiss. Once they broke apart he asked &quot;What was that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to kiss you just once before we go to the beach&quot; Randi said. &quot;We may not come back. I also want to say that I love you. Do you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I do love you Randi&quot; Harken said blushing a little. &quot;Let's make sure we survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me&quot; Mr. Moss said coming down the stairs followed by Mrs. Moss. &quot;Let's go you two love birds.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they left Harken was sincerely hoping that neither of them came to any harm.</p>
