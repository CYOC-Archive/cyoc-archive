<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a woman; she had sun-bleached, mousey blonde hair, some of which was twisted into dreadlocks. She was rail-thin, and dressed in a somewhat drab, simple sundress. And she was definitely a werewolf, judging by the smell of her. She immediately got into a guarded posture when she saw me.<br />
<br />
“Friend of yours?” she asked me.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” I replied.<br />
<br />
“You being funny?”<br />
<br />
“No, I&#39;m not,” I said. “I legit don&#39;t know if he is or not. I know he WAS..but..I don&#39;t know if I can trust him.”  I gestured over to a couple of the bodies. “Friends of YOURS?”<br />
<br />
She nodded. “Mostly, yeah,” she told me. “They could be dickheads, but..they didn&#39;t deserve to go out at the hands of a fucking hunter.” She approached me, seeming to be a bit more at ease with me. Her body language was that of an animal barely contained in her skin. She sniffed the air around me, clearly tasting my scent. “You smoke?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Me? No, I&#39;m not a smoker,” I said. “If you&#39;re wondering about the weird scent, it&#39;s him,” I said, pointing at Eli.<br />
<br />
The girl laughed, “No, dude..I mean..do you SMOKE?” She held a blunt out.<br />
<br />
“OHHHH,” I said, wondering how this sort of misunderstanding didn&#39;t happen far more frequently in the stoner community, “Yeah, I&#39;m good with that.”<br />
<br />
“Shayla,” the dreadlocked girl said, lighting the blunt and sending a cloud of acrid and intoxicating smoke into the air.<br />
<br />
“James,” I replied. “So,” I said as I took the proferred blunt, “do you know how your pack ended up getting into this fight?” Two hits..and it was hitting me like a truck. My head was already buzzing. There was a weird taste to the weed, and I suspected it had been laced. But I wasn&#39;t worried; the wolf instincts weren&#39;t going haywire at this point.<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s a hunter holdout that way,” she gestured vaguely in the direction of the fortress. “I guess those assholes caught another of us. Mickey..” she gestured to one of the corpses, “decided that maybe we should do something about it. And then suddenly, all hell breaks loose over there.” She passed the blunt back, giving me a stoned, happy smile. I could smell the wolf in her much more strongly, and see the wolf hidden in her gaze much more easily. <br />
<br />
“Yeah..that was us,” I said. “Well, me, at first. The one they got was..special to me,” I said, choosing my words carefully. I took a couple more hits, and my buzz continued to intensify. It was an interesting high, because while I was definitely stoned, I was alert, and seemed more attuned with the wolf again. “Eli,” I said, gesturing to him, “That hunter..he helped me get her out. He and I knew each other a long time ago. I guess you could say in another life.  He turned on them. He killed a lot of them. I..probably should trust him, but..” I wasn&#39;t going to share his secret with her, so I just let my words trail off.<br />
<br />
“But once you&#39;re one of us, you don&#39;t let just anybody get close,” she said. She leaned up close to me, putting her lips against mine and blowing a shotgun of smoke into my mouth. It was unexpected, but not unwelcome. I could smell her wolf more strongly still, and feel myself on the verge of the change.  She pulled back away from me, though not too far. Her eyes were sultry, and she had a lusty, hungry look on her face. “So that was your howl we heard?” <br />
<br />
I nodded, getting another hungry smile in response. “It was..inspiring,” she said, licking her lips. “It got a lot of us fired up, ready to hunt and fight. Those fuckers have been picking us off for awhile now.”  She pressed up against me, giving me another shotgun kiss, and nipping my bottom lip. Her eyes stayed locked on mine, and the invitation was clear. I wrapped my arm around the small of her back, keeping her close. I let my hand stray to her ass, and through the thin material of the sundress, I could tell that she wasn&#39;t wearing anything underneath. I leaned my head forward, and she placed the nearly finished blunt to my lips. I deeply inhaled one last time, then blew her a shotgun of my own.<br />
<br />
“We changed and went out into the woods..we spotted this guy, dressed like a hunter..and drew our own conclusions. Our alpha..he told me and Rita to run, once we saw this guy was somehow much more dangerous than a hunter normally is.” She frowned for a second, and I kicked myself. She didn&#39;t need to be thinking about her dead packmates right now. “Can we..not talk about that right now?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but just..just one more thing. It&#39;s been bugging me. So..how did..” my head was really swimming now, and Shayla laughed as she saw the mildly dazed look in my eyes, “Uhh..how did the pack change? It&#39;s not like it was a full moon last night.”<br />
<br />
“Special blend,” Shayla said with a smile. “I&#39;m surprised you couldn&#39;t taste it,” she said as her eyes yellowed. “A little wolfbane mixed with weed has a happy side effect of forcing the change. And you should be feeling it right..about..now..”<br />
<br />
I could feel my muscles starting to twich, and she let out a growl and leapt on me, knocking me to the ground. “Let&#39;s go wild!” she growled into my ear, nipping my neck lightly as her trembling hands moved to unbutton my shorts. She climbed up onto my erection as it sprang out of my fly, giving me easy entrance into her heated and changing mound, and peeled the dress off in a smooth motion as she began to ride me aggressively.<br />
<br />
All conscious thought was pushed aside as the sensations of sex and the transformation combined to form an overwhelming combination. My body swelled and warped as she rode me. The popping and stretching of her body vibrated through me and added to my own sensations of pleasure. All I wanted was to change and fuck this bitch; it was what we were meant to do. Abandon reason, live on instinct, be dominant once more!<br />
<br />
My changing cock grew larger and larger inside of her, making her scream with pleasure, throaty bestial noises as her muzzle grew and tits blossomed. We climaxed together, sharing a long howl of release. She collapsed onto me. We were stuck like that for a minute or two, until my knot deflated, and she licked at my chest, unable to even reach my muzzle, due to how much of a size difference there was. I was fully three and a half feet taller than she was, and easily outweighed her by 300 pounds in my perfect form.<br />
<br />
We untangled, and she seemed in awe of me for a moment after we stood up and she could fully appreciate the size difference. “What do they call you?” she growled. “I am Sativa.”<br />
<br />
“Romulus,” I replied. <br />
<br />
Her body language was reflecting wonder and submission as she approached me again. She inhaled my scent more deeply, as I did hers. “That&#39;s an old name,” she growled. “Who gave it to you?”<br />
<br />
“My mother.”<br />
<br />
Her head cocked at an odd angle, and she stared intently at me. All traces of the lust we&#39;d had only minutes before were gone. “I must go,” she told me. “What&#39;s left of my pack needs me.”<br />
<br />
“Take him with you,” I said, gesturing to Eli. “Keep him safe. Keep an eye on him, but keep him safe.”<br />
Instinctively, I knew that this wasn&#39;t done; a werewolf didn&#39;t make outright demands of someone not in their pack, or at least not something of this nature.<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment, then nodded and picked his limp, fevered form up. “Our pack is made of the unwanted and unloved. Society&#39;s outcasts. We deny no one a place. We will help him.” She approached me again and nuzzled my chest, marking me with her scent again and getting my scent fresh once more on her.<br />
<br />
“Be well...” she said hesitating before saying my name, “Romulus. I hope we meet again.”<br />
<br />
“You as well,” I replied.</p>
