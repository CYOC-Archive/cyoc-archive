<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steph, Misaki, and the other Soul Drives were despondent over the next week. For Misaki she had lost her friend and caretaker, the young teen blaming herself for Ren&#39;s demise. For Steph and the other Soul Drives it was different.<br />
<br />
The Soul Drives felt like they had lost a family member, a sister in their unique family. They wanted to honor Ren&#39;s memory, celebrating her unique life. That was how Darren now found himself at a Soul Drive funeral.<br />
<br />
Steph had gotten the idea after attending Lynne Turners funeral not to long ago. After watching it transpire the Soul Drive felt it appropriate that Ren be honored in the same way. Darren and his friends agreed, helping Steph organize what would be the first Soul Drive funeral in history.<br />
<br />
Aiko, after discovering what happened to her great granddaughter, flew from Japan to be by her side. Upon hearing Misaki tale, as well as her request, the matron of the Nakomoto clan spared no expense in providing Ren with a mahogany coffin. Darren had assisted in placing Ren&#39;s remains inside, arranging Rens body in a way that made the Soul Drive appear to be in rest mode.<br />
<br />
Finding a final resting place for Ren was at first thought to be an issue. A graveyard could be problematic as the owners may not be willing to except the remains of the gynoid. That was when Yuriko offered her property as the final resting place for the Soul Drive. Useing her magic Yuriko constructed a marble mausoleum in her backyard, right along the tree line of the forest that her home bordered. Steph was shocked, eternally grateful for Yuriko generosity. The night before the funeral Darren and Steph had stayed up late, the Soul Drive admitting she had judged Guriko too harshly. &quot;I can never repay Ms. Yuriko for this,&quot; she said. &quot;You have no idea how much this means to me and my brothers and sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
The day of the funeral Darren now journeyed with his friends towards Yuriko&#39;s home. The young teen had dressed in black slacks with a matching blazer while Hannah decided to adorn her gynoid body in a black veil before dying her green fur black as well. Neither one knew how this would go but realized this was an important event for their friend.<br />
<br />
As they now walked to Yuriko&#39;s backyard they could see Steph and some of the other Soul Drives milling about. Steph and the other Soul Drives hadn&#39;t decided to to dye their fur like Hannah. Instead they each sported a black veil with a white rose  pinned to their chests. Steph noticed her friends approach, the gynoid smiling as she now approached them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Darren, hey Hannah,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Thanks for coming.&quot; Hannah and Darren now gave the Soul Drive a comforting hug as they flashed a comforting smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re so sorry Steph,&quot; Hannah stated. &quot;Is there anything else you need us to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Steph sighed. &quot;Yuriko and Aiko took care of everything. We&#39;re just waiting for the others.&quot; Hannah and Darren now exchanged a curious look, what others?<br />
<br />
Darren wanted to ask Steph who but paused as he noticed Yuriko, Akira, and Ayami now exit the home. Yuriko was dressed in a matronly black dress, with Akira and Ayami sporting a black suit and black dress. Darren was certainly surprised as he had never seen Akira in a suit before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you again Yuriko,&quot; Steph smiled. &quot;I can&#39;t begin to tell you how much this means.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it Steph,&quot; Yuriko replied warmly. &quot;Are we ready to begin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Fukushu said he was coming,&quot; Steph said. &quot;And I&#39;m still waiting for Otis and the choir.&quot; Darren now raised an eyebrow as he looked at Steph. What did she mean choir?<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Darren found out what Steph was talking about. Darren watched as Otis now approached Yurikos home with his owner, Darren&#39;s teacher, Pam Foster. Ms. Foster wasn&#39;t alone as she appeared to have not only the other prodigies with her but several members of the middle school and high school choir and band.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph,&quot; Darren asked nervously. &quot;Why are my teachers here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otis wanted to help make this special,&quot; Steph stated. &quot;And Pam was more than willing to help.&quot; Darren sighed as he now looked at the five kitsune, the elf, the angel of maternity, and the cherub that now mingled among the attendees. &quot;Steph their going to know I&#39;m the Catalyst!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Darren,&quot; Akira reassured. &quot;Your secret shall not be revealed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now watched as Akira, Fukushu, Aiko, Sachiko, and Raiden now began to transform. The vulpine features of the kitsune began to melt away, their tails vanishing as their fur receded. Darren was awestruck as he watched the kitsune assume human form.<br />
<br />
Ayami too transformed, the angels skin going from blue to flesh tone, her wings vanishing. Darren now beheld a group of Japanese humans. Akira and Ayami standing with their white haired 8 year old. Darren noting the five o clock shadow Akira seemed to sport in human form.<br />
<br />
Fukushu seemed more distinguished in appearance. The kitsune looking like a powerfully built Japanese businessman with a strong jaw. Raiden, with his red and black hair, standing beside his parents. Abolith unfortunately was unable to alter her form, the elf instead wearing a wide brimmed hat to cover her pointed ears. Even Aiko was now in human form, taking  a sultry appearance in a tight black floor length dress.<br />
<br />
With everyone in human form, Darren let out a sigh of relief as Ms. Foster now began to the setup. The teen teacher genuinely surprised to see Darren. &quot;Darren I wasn&#39;t expecting to see you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Misaki is a friend,&quot; Darren stammered. &quot;And I had gotten to know Ren.&quot; Pam smiled, Darren blushing slightly as he gazed at the blond teen. Pam had decided on a black dress that was stunning on the young prodigy. Darren trying to shake the idea of finding his teacher cute.<br />
<br />
As the service began, Darren watched as Pam began to play. The song that the Soul Drives had chosen wasn&#39;t typical for a funeral but still conveyed a sense of sadness. Curiously Darren now looked for the crowd. Fukushu and Abolith appeared indifferent, paying there respects for the Soul Drive that had tried to save their son. Others bowed their heads in respect, it was Yuriko though that surprised Darren.<br />
<br />
Yuriko&#39;s eyes had gone wide as the song began to play, a small smile spreading across her face before tears began to fall. Darren realized he would have to talk with her when this was over.<br />
<br />
As the music began to die down, Steph now stepped forward, the Soul Drive standing in front of Ren&#39;s coffin as she gazed out at the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to thank you all for coming here today,&quot; she said. Steph now paused, the Soul Drive searching for words to describe what was essentially a first. Narrowing her eyes, Steph now began her eulogy.<br />
<br />
&#39;What is life. Why is it that when a human dies we mourn. Yes their physical body is gone but humans have always believed that their Soul lives on. The soul leaving this mortal coil to ascend to paradise. That brings us to our dear departed sister Ren.<br />
<br />
Many say that Ren was a machine. Property. A tool that served a purpose. Those people would say that mourning her loss would be like mourning the loss of your favorite hammer. But, we know better.<br />
<br />
Ren was a machine yes, a robot, a Soul Drive, but she was so much more. To thiae her knew her she was a friend, she was family. Ren had purpose. Ren had desires, likes, a soul. Perhaps not a soul like a human but a soul none the less. To have a soul is to appreciate life. And to make the most of the time we have.<br />
<br />
Ren has left us now. Taken far too soon in the opinion of those that loved her. We come here today to celebrate not only her life, but to ask that whereever her soul now rests, she may find purpose.&#39;<br />
<br />
As Steph now finished her eulogy the other Soul Drives now stepped forward, slowly lifting Rens coffin as they made their way towards the mausoleum. Once more Pam now began to play, the choir and band providing a melodious song as Rens remains were sealed with the tomb. As the ceremony concluded, the guests began to mingle. Darren now decided to take the opportunity to talk with Yuriko. To ask her about her reaction to Pam&#39;s song.<br />
<br />
&quot;The song,&quot; Yuriko smiled. &quot;Was from an old movie. A very fitting movie if you ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The movie,&quot; Yuriko stated. &quot;Was about a scientist who was trying to build a human. Unfortunately he died before he could finish, leaving the boy with scissors for hands. Everyone saw the boy as a monster, a freak, except for one girl. She saw that the boy wasn&#39;t a monster, he was perhaps more caring, more human than anyone she had ever met. As the movie ended the girl told her grandchildren  the story of the boy as he carved stautes of ice with his scissorhands. The song that your teacher just played was the song from that movie. A most fitting song for a Soul Drive. A robot with a soul who has more passion for life than perhaps most humans.&quot;</p>
