<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cam was sweating in the glass chamber as it filled with oily steam.  A heavy yellow liquid collected at his <br />
feet.  It was up to his ankles, when it started to drain through attached tubing. He watched as the yellow <br />
liquid flowed through glass tubing and dripped into jars of clear liquid.  Several drops of Cam's essence were <br />
all that was needed to cause the clear liquid to transform into an opaque buttery substance.  Cam could see an <br />
Asian kid screwing lids on the jars and placing new jars of clear liquid under the yellow drip.<br />
<br />
The chamber smelled of Eucalyptus and Lotus and Cam was dizzy.  He didn't know how much time had elapsed. He <br />
was back in his clothes, but they no longer fit him properly.  It was like he had lost 20-30 lbs.  He was <br />
disoriented, and he seemed shorter than before.   He slumped in a chair in the corner of the ointment shop.  <br />
He looked around at his half naked team mates.  They were stripped down to their boxers, briefs, boxer briefs, <br />
jockstraps and even one guy was wearing a thong.  They each held a familiar looking jar of creamy yellow goop <br />
which they were slathering on each other. <br />
<br />
Cam stared at his team mates they seemed to be changing.  He could still recognize who they had been, but the <br />
shorter ones were taller, the stout ones were leaner.  The guys with darker hair were getting lighter, the <br />
guys with hair lighter than his were getting darker.  The two black team mates with his group looked more <br />
mulatto than black now. Same with the lone Asian on the team, Jack Mitsubishi the kicker now had green eyes, <br />
and he looked more like Taylor Lautner or Dean Cain. They all were starting to look like Cam.  His teammates <br />
literally seemed to be becoming his brothers or cousins.  It didn't make sense. He opened his mouth, and felt <br />
so weak. He closed his mouth.  <br />
<br />
The teammates redressed themselves, paid and thanked Mr. Woo, and left carrying boxes of &quot;Tiger Balm&quot; for the <br />
rest of the team. Cameron watched as they left the store. <br />
<br />
The Asian kid appeared and helped him to stand. Lin-lin whispered, &quot;You better go, sir. You need to stay with <br />
your friends.&quot; He led Cam by the elbow out the door and as he shoved him after his teammates, Lin-lin added, <br />
&quot;Read the note as soon as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Note?&quot; mumbled Cam. He looked in his hands and checked his pockets.  Then he felt the sharp corner of paper <br />
jab the soft spot under his scrotum. He needed to get back to the hotel, so he could get the note out of his <br />
underwear.<br />
<br />
Somehow or other he managed to stay with his teammates.  They no longer seemed enthralled with him, they were <br />
enthralled with each other.  As they entered the hotel lobby, Cam saw his reflection and theirs in the <br />
mirrored lobby wall. He looked like his sickly kid brother - if he had had one, and his teammates looked more <br />
like he used to look than he looked now.  Their clothing fit them wrong like his did, but it was because they <br />
were taller, leaner or more muscled.  His clothing fit him wrong because he was smaller, lighter, less muscled <br />
and emaciated.  He looked like he had been deathly ill for weeks. His crotch felt strangely hard and heavy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Cam, we're going back out on the town,&quot; Cory said as Cam sat on his hotel bed resting his head between <br />
his legs, &quot;Ya wanna join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, uh. No. I'm not feeling well, must have gotten some bad sushi,&quot; he said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck. Well, get rested up then, we need you for the big game tomorrow,&quot; Cory said, but strangely he no longer <br />
felt that was true.  Thanks to the Tiger Balm, he felt as invigorated and capable as Cam had ever been. He <br />
closed the door behind him, and put Cam out of his mind.<br />
<br />
Alone at last, Cam undid his belt.  He blinked, someone had punched a new hole in the belt so that it would <br />
hold up his pants with his considerably narrower waist. He noticed that the cuffs on his pants had been rolled <br />
up about two inches on each leg.  He stared down at the yellowed briefs he was wearing.  He didn't own any <br />
briefs.  He had been wearing blue cotton boxer shorts when he had left the hotel earlier. He could see the <br />
outline of a folded piece of paper and what resembled some sort of athletic cup through the fabric.  He <br />
realized that the note would have fallen out of his boxers, but he didn't understand why they just didn't hand <br />
him the note or put it in his pants pocket. He reached inside the briefs to get the note and his hand hit cold <br />
steel.<br />
<br />
&quot;IMPORTANT READ THIS IF YOU EVER WANT TO BE MORE THAN A SHADOW OF YOUR FORMER SELF,&quot;  was written on the <br />
outside of the folded paper.  The author certainly had Cam's attention. He hurriedly unfolded the paper and <br />
read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your essence has been extracted, and is now transforming your teammates.  Do not use any of the Tiger Balm <br />
containing your extracted essence as it will just make you sweat out the little remaining essence you still <br />
have.  If you ejaculate anytime in the next two weeks, you could similarly lose vital essence, and never <br />
recover. That's why the chastity device is locked on your cock. You can still piss, but you cannot get hard. I <br />
know you probably need to remove it when you play football, so your teammate Cory has the key. Do not leave it <br />
off, even a wet dream could prove tragic for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam stared at the paper re-reading the paragraph twice more before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you do nothing, your essence should stabilize at its current level and you can remove the chastity device. <br />
But if you wish to regain your former essence, you will have to do something that you will probably find <br />
distasteful.  In more ways than one. :P&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam pursed his lips and continued to read. &quot;Your essence when absorbed by your teammates will migrate to their <br />
testes. The only way you can regain your lost essence will be by swallowing your teammates cum.  They have <br />
enough Tiger Balm to last 2 weeks, and by the end of two weeks, their bodies' essences will stabilize in their <br />
new enhanced forms. However, your essence will stay in their bodies for at least six months.  So you will need <br />
to suck their cocks for at least two months, perhaps six or more to regain all your lost essence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Under no circumstance should you ever return to Mr. Woo's ointment shop.  If you had come in alone tonight, <br />
he would have distilled all your essence out of you until their was nothing left but a husk of your former <br />
self. He still could fill several cases with the small essence you have left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cam, you at least have the chance to regain your former essence. No matter how you feel about it, you must <br />
suck ALL of your teammates' cocks, if you ever want to be restored completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was signed, &quot;A Friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam reread the note in disbelief, and then crumpled the paper in anger. He lay down on his bed. He was too <br />
weak.  He fell asleep.</p>
