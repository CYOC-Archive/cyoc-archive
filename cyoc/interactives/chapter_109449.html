<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Startled, Jack turned to give Oliver a puzzled look.  &quot;Huh?&quot;  he was sure he had misheard.<br />
<br />
The boy chuckled.  &quot;Werewolf.  You know, man magically turning into a wolf at the full moon, though most of what they have in movies is crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, riiight.&quot;  Jack backed away a few steps, putting some distance between them.  The kid was a nut case.  That helped explain why he was running around naked and crashing in a storage shed.  &quot;Um, look, why don&#39;t I go check outside.  Maybe your clothes are on the other side of the shed.&quot;  Damn!  He was still glancing down at Oliver&#39;s impressive sexual equipment, which was becoming aroused.  To make matters worse, so was Jack&#39;s.    He needed to get away and clear his head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.&quot;  Oliver grinned.  &quot;I didn&#39;t have any.  I was the &#39;dog&#39; you saw last night.  A Dire Wolf, actually.  You must suck at biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
Big black dog.  Dire wolf.  Jack did suck at biology - he failed it twice before switching to general sciences.  That didn&#39;t change his growing fear that this kid was an escaped lunatic.  <br />
<br />
Oliver raised his hands up in a &#39;surrender&#39; gesture.  &quot;Look, I promise I am not going to hurt you.  but before we can go any further, I need to prove to you that I am not crazy, and that..  well... you have some interesting options.&quot;  And with that, the handsome, slender teenage boy suddenly started to sprout hair and twist.  Before Jack could react more than a startled gasp, he was looking down at a very large black wolf.  The animal sat down, tail wagging, and gave a kind of woof.<br />
<br />
Jack woke up laying on his couch, and opened his eyes to see Oliver&#39;s face smiling down at him.  It took a moment to realize his head was in the boy&#39;s lap.  He jerked upright, then almost fell back as his head spun.  &quot;Take it easy, buddy.&quot;  Oliver pressed him gently back down.  &quot;You passed out.  Fainted.  Guess having a werewolf do a full transformation was more than you could handle.&quot;  One of Oliver&#39;s hands was massaging the back of Jack&#39;s head.  It felt nice.<br />
<br />
A lot of things went through his mind.  First, he was afraid he might be going crazy.  Then, if this was real, that Oliver had not hurt him.  Then that he really liked this contact with the boy.  Then back to fears he was losing his mind.  Jack blinked and stared - Oliver&#39;s eyes were golden wolf&#39;s eyes!  Not the brown human ones he had seen before.  And - as he stared, the boy&#39;s face pushed out, becoming a muzzle filled with massive fangs.  The bare chest filled out and became covered with matted fur, and the lap he was resting on enlarged.  At the same time, a strong musky odor filled his nostrils.  Oliver was not a wolf, though.  He was a very large humanoid wolf, probably over six feet tall when standing on his hind paws.<br />
<br />
Jack realized he was trembling, and then flushed as he also felt dampness in his pants.  He had pissed himself in fear, and the urine odor joined the wolf smell.  Curiously, Oliver somehow managed to get a smile across with his animal features, and he maintained the massage of Jack&#39;s head.    Then the werewolf pulled Jack up into an embrace and gave him a long hug.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know this is a lot to take in, but I promise I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;  Oliver licked his ear.  &quot;Werewolves are not vicious predators.  I&#39;m sorry about last night.  I had too much to drink and was sorta out of it.&quot;  He lay Jack&#39;s head back in his furry lap.  &quot;If you want me to leave, I will.  It&#39;s not like you would tell anyone about me, right?  But if you will let me stay a while, you might find things pretty interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack looked up into those golden eyes.  He was still scared, but more now about fears his mind was going.  &quot;Not like the Chinese curse, I hope.&quot;  He had trouble talking, mouth dry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;  Slowly, the werewolf changed back into a human teenager.  &quot;I am roughly 187 years old.  I was bitten by a werewolf when I was about 30, and that was upper middle age back then.  After my first change, I looked like this.  Totally different. even my voice.  Nobody knew who I was, and when I tried to explain what happened half of the town thought I was a devil and tried to burn me at the stake.  Never did find the one that bit me, but now I&#39;d just thank him or her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack frowned.  &quot;You are 187?  Why do you look like a kid?&quot;  This all seemed impossible, but the talk was calming him down some.  &quot;And what were you doing in my back yard?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy shrugged.  &quot;Apparently the werewolf magic does some kind of rejuvenation, and then keeps you young.  Only injuries that really matter are from silver or pewter, and even they heal in time.  As for your back yard, I got drunk and lost.  I really do live down the street.  Set myself up in one of the apartments and go to the local high school.  Keeps people from asking too many questions. &quot;<br />
<br />
Not hardly.  Jack was full of questions.  But he couldn&#39;t get one out.  He stared up into Oliver&#39;s face and flushed, finding himself still attracted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;  Oliver grinned and bent over to kiss Jack&#39;s forehead.  &quot;You haven&#39;t run screaming, so at least you haven&#39;t devolved into total panic.  So the next question is. how would you like to join me?  I&#39;ve gotten sorta lonely, and would like to have some family.&quot;</p>
