<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emilio stares at you through the glass, a glazed look in her eye. But not <br />
so glazed as to hide a distinct twinkle.  She slams her hands against <br />
the window of the passenger's side door, demanding to be let in.  <br />
Naturally, having witnessed so many infections in the last few hours <br />
left Brad feeling disinclined to acquiesce to her amorous insistences.  <br />
And he was inclined to say as much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the fuck away from me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad felt stuck.  And indeed he was in quite a pickle.  With Emilio <br />
pounding on the window, and the other two rocking the van from side <br />
to side, Brad found himself trapped.  And he was beginning to panic.  <br />
The thought of becoming a sex driven bimbo did not appeal to him in <br />
spite of the fond memories he had of the few times he had actually <br />
had sex.  If the news reports were true, he would lose entire sections <br />
of his memory - his life up until this point.  A life that had not seen <br />
much accmplishment other than a marriage at a young age age and a <br />
bachelor's degree. Now his degree was useless and his marriage <br />
ended in the midst of his honeymoon.<br />
<br />
It pained him to think of Sarah.  They had come to the island to <br />
celebrate their honeymoon after a short engagent and a wedding right <br />
out of college.  It was a honeymoon that had ended with Sarah <br />
demanding Brad fuck her.  And though such a demand might seem <br />
like a gift in disguise, it was a demand brought on by the bimbo virus.  <br />
Sarah had succumbed to the infection after being accosted in a <br />
bathroom at a restaurant.  She had chased Brad through the halls of <br />
their hotel until Sarah found another victim who was more receptive <br />
to her needs.  Though that man would have thought twice if he'd <br />
known what he was getting himself into.<br />
<br />
Aother thump on th plexiglass driver's side window of the ambulance <br />
called Brad back from his memories of his beloved wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emilia wants some dick up in this cooter!&quot; she yelled as she grabbed <br />
her crotch and made a lude geture.  Cries of, &quot;Me too!&quot; Echoed from <br />
outside the van.<br />
<br />
Brad stood up from the driver's seat.  He looked over his shoulder and <br />
thought about bolting out the back of the ambulance.  As the pilot <br />
pushed on one side of the van as if to tip it over, he thought about the <br />
strength of these women, and their tenacity.<br />
<br />
The woman who had converted the pilot pushed from the other side, <br />
rocking the ambulance the other way.  It was beginning to dawn on <br />
Brad how simpleminded, or myopic, the bimbos could be.  If one <br />
flipped the vehicle over, she'd squish the other.<br />
<br />
Emilio pounded on the window again, this time hard enough to crack <br />
the window just a bit. A grating sound of metal sliding against metal <br />
and the glint of something sliding across the back of the ambulance <br />
caught his eye:  Officer Emilio Rodriguez's service pistol.  The <br />
mysterious Zephyr had disarmed Emilio but had not collected his <br />
weapon before fleeing in a speed boat.  Brad made a quick leap for it <br />
and landed hard on his side, a sharp pain all too apparent in his right <br />
thigh.  He grabbed the gun and stood but nearly fell over from the <br />
pain of his landing.  He held the gun in his left hand as he grabbed for <br />
histhigh with the right, afraid to find a needle or syringe.  Instead, he <br />
found the most useful thing he could possibly hope to find at that <br />
moment.<br />
<br />
He had found the keys to the ambulance.<br />
<br />
He rushed to the driver's seat as Emilio pounded on the glass hard <br />
enough to send cracks through much of the window and leave a little <br />
bit of blood where she had made contact.  Brad slid the keys in the <br />
ignition, started the ambulance, and threw it in reverse.   His foot <br />
slammed on the gas pedal and he raced backward before Emilio could <br />
land another blow against the beleagured window.  Brad backed away <br />
from the trio until he could turn the vehicle around.  He sped away <br />
taking random turns throughout the harbor until he reached an empty <br />
section next to a marina and a neighborhood.<br />
<br />
He had gotten away from the infected but was still stuck on the island.   <br />
Zephyr had sped away in a boat to leave he and Emilio to be sexually <br />
ravaged by beautiful bimbos spreading their bimboism, and Emilio <br />
himself had just fallen to the pilot that was supposed to rescue them.<br />
<br />
Brad stepped out of the ambulance and jogged down a pier toward <br />
one of the many boats tied up there when he heard a shout carrry <br />
across the water, and more voices throwing up demands for dick.  <br />
Brad spied the trio at the edge of a street light, eunning toward him.  <br />
He turned around to run toward the nearby houses he had seen when <br />
he stopped cold in his tracks.  Lights had come on from inside some of <br />
the houses and silhouettes could be seen flitting about behind <br />
curtains.  Shouts for help sounded out as people woke up to find <br />
bimbos breaking into their homes.  He could see a pair of bimbos <br />
trying to force their way into a home while one pleaded withwhoever <br />
was barring her from entering, insisting her pendulous tits only <br />
needed to be sucked a little bit, to take the edge off her heat.<br />
<br />
Brad turned back just in time to see that the trio was almost upon <br />
him.  Being so close to the water, /rad made the best decision he could <br />
have.  He made a mad dash for the end of the pier, grabbing a circular <br />
life preserver as he went.  He reached the end and without breaking <br />
stride, leaped off the end.  He fell into the cold abyss of the ocean, <br />
nearly losing his gun and preserver.  But he clung to the life preserver <br />
nevertheless, stuck the gun in the small of his back and tightened his <br />
belt to help prevent losing it, though he didn't think a wet gun would <br />
fire and it would probably rust soon enough in the salty sea anyway.  <br />
But he kept it regardless and then kicked and swam against the waves <br />
and away from shore under a clear, moonlit night.  He floated in the <br />
ocean, having not the slightest clue where he was going or what he <br />
would do next.</p>
