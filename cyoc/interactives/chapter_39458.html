<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>He stared in the mirror as his skin prickled with goosebumps. The tingle that coursed through his body had ended, but with it came some changes that Ty was not expecting to have happen to him. Ty realized that he was careless in all his wishes, not including the stipulation that he would be immune to the changes the rest of the world would go through. Although, in hindsight, Ty knew that his not specifying his immunity was better in the long run because he knew that humans would be the rare species in his new world, making him the minority. Ty was a guy who, even though he usually liked his solidarity, didn't want to be one of the "outcast" and be part of the "normal" crowd.</Br>
<Br>Now that the prickly goosebumps went away, the itch that Ty thought he was feeling, manifested itself and Ty could not help but to scratch the insationable itch. As Ty stood in front of the mirror, he watched as the hair on his arms darkened to a rich chestnut brown from his original dirty blond. This was something that Ty liked, not really fond of being blond and having blond body hair. He liked the rich and dark texture that made the hair stand out instead of blending into his light tanned skin. Curious about himself, Ty wished that everyone would freeze except for himself so that he could see what he wanted without consequences of indecency. As soon as the wish in his mind ended, it became reality and he was the only one in the room that was still mobile.</Br>
<Br>Ty, standing at the mirror on the classroom wall, lifted up his jeans and saw that not only did his arm hair change, but all of his hair darkened. Enjoying the darker hair, Ty thought that was about as much that would happen, but that was not the case. Ty watched in the mirror as the thin covering of hair thickened, growing densely in the areas that already had hair naturally. Ty, looking in the mirror, saw himself as an adult male instead of the seventeen year old he really was. Ty smiled, loving what has happened so far, but wondering what would happen next. Not so much as after that mental questioning did Ty get what he asked for. He felt an odd sensation course through his body, with his muscles twinging after, like an eye twitch being an involuntary movement. Suddenly, his muscles began thickening, ballooning out in proportion, making him look as though he had worked out for years when he never lifted anything more than a five pound gallon of milk. Impressed with these changes, he knew that all he had to do was wait and then something else would make itself known.</Br>
<Br>The tingling came back to his face, as a rich and thick full beard grew out of the many pores. Once that was finished, Ty smiled, enjoying the new beard which he never thought that he would. Ty knew that he could look much older than everyone else he knew in school because of how full of a beard he could grow if he chose, but felt that it would make him be more of an outcast than he would have liked. Now that he had it, Ty liked the beard and wanted to keep it for a while. Then Ty noticed that his new and fully developed pecs were also covered in the same thick, full hair like the rest of his body.</Br>
<Br>Thinking he would remain human, just with some more adult like features, Ty was just about to wish for the room to unfreeze but he soon saw that there was something more that was going on here and not just a quick alteration into manhood.</Br>
<Br>A pain racked through his body, not one that was unpleasant, but to the contrary was rather invigorating and erotic. Ty felt and watched his muscles and body hair thicken even more. Wanting it to continue, Ty pulled off his t-shirt from over his head so that he could see every last thing that happened to him. Ty smirked though, when he saw the new and more muscular him. Excitement abounded within him and then Ty let his pants fall to the floor, leaving his shoes and socks on. Ty didn't think that anything would happen to himself down there anyway, so he didn't bother, he just wanted a clearer view of himself. Ty further enjoyed looking at his now hairy body, thinking of how much of a man he looked now. Then something more made itself prevalent, more animalistic in nature.</Br>
<Br>As the eroticism intensified, Ty moaned with the intense amount of pleasure he was feeling, but stopped when the moan turned to a slight growl. As the feeling grew even more intense, Ty tasted an odd tinge of fluid in his mouth. Wondering exactly what it was, Ty placed his finger in his mouth, touching his teeth and gums thinking he would only find saliva, but when he looked at his finger, his eyes grew wide in shock. The fluid was red and thick, in fact it was his own blood. Wondering what could cause this, Ty smiled while looking at his teeth he noticed that his bicuspids on both bottom and top sets had grown longer and sharper.</Br>
<Br>Thinking about the new change, Ty found himself stir in excitement, with the more animal side of himself making itself present. This time, a growl came from the excitement and Ty liked it, wanting yet another one to come. Looking in the mirror, he could see that his manhood had changed as well, being thicker and fuller than he could ever remember it being. Curious, he dropped his tightie-whities to the floor along with his pants and smiled at his bigger unit. His cock was about as thick as a popcan and his balls were the size of tennis balls, which was filled to the hilt with precious cream. Being unable to control his animal side, Ty found himself touching his manhood only to have his hand covered in thick and copious amounts of precum. Another growl, this time more animalistic and longer, which threw Ty into the freedom that came with it.</Br>
<Br>Letting himself enjoy what was happening unlocked the door and allowed the animal within him to be free. Eroticism abounded while his body thickened, bones popping and lengthening, hair thickening changing to fur. Ty smiled and chuckled as his hands shifted into paws, with his fingernails darkening and lengthening to claws. Suddenly his feet burst through his shoes, with his toe claws poking through them. Feeling trapped and imprisoned by them, Ty shook them off, tearing them apart and allowing himself to be completely free of the clothes. Ty growled longer, this time blending into a full blown howl as his face pushed out into a muzzle and his ears grew to a point while shifting to the top of his head. Again, Ty howled while fur enveloped his entire muscular body, and a tail pushed out of his spine.</Br>
<Br>With his transformation over, Ty knew that he wanted to stay like this, so he made one final wish about himself and he made it outloud.</Br>
<Br><I>I wish that I can never make any more wishes to change myself. I like how I am and I wish for it to be permanent with the ability to change at will.</I></Br>
<Br>Satisfied with himself and the final wish, Ty wished that no one would ever care about him being naked, as well as with all the rest of the werewolves that would inevitably be joining him, with or without his direct involvement with the normal humans. Then, Ty wished for everyone to be unfrozen, to see his marvelous transformation into a full fledged werewolf.</Br></p>
