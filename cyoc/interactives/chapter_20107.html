<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve finally managed to climb out of the pool, using the small metal ladder which was attached to the inner wall of the large, Olympic pool. As soon as he had made his way out of the water, he walked over to Peter, with his clothes dripping wet!<br />
<br />
“Just what do you think you’re doing?” Steve said angrily.<br />
<br />
“I… I… I’m sorry, Coach!” Peter replied sadly. “My muscles just shrink and grow a lot… I didn’t mean it, Coach… Honest…”<br />
<br />
Steve stared at Peter, taking note of his giant pectorals. Peter looked incredible, with these huge pecs which stood out from the rest of his body by almost three feet!<br />
<br />
“You don’t look like a swimmer at all! I don’t know how you grew such a big chest, but you look ridiculous and you don’t belong on a swim team, looking like this!” Steve sneered at the boy.<br />
<br />
“I can explain, Coach… I…” Peter began to explain, when he stopped in the middle of the sentence. That tingling sensation had returned! He was about to change again!<br />
<br />
Peter looked down and gasped when he realized that his giant pectorals had begun to shrink back. He was able to look down again, since his pecs were no longer pushing up against his chin. Within seconds, his pecs were back to normal, and Peter looked like a regular member of the High School swim team once again.<br />
<br />
Peter just returned a brief smile to his coach, who was still staring at him with a very serious look on his face.<br />
<br />
“Now, you need to go to the gym and lift some weights! I want the guys on my team to at least have some muscle! You have to look good when the press shows up to take your picture! I don’t want any swimmers on my team, who look like they just came from some bean-pole convention, do you hear me?” Steve growled back at the boy.<br />
<br />
“I’ll work out, Coach… I understand, Coach… I hear you, Coach…” Peter replied politely.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter felt that tingling sensation throughout his entire body! Allen was doing something to his muscles!<br />
<br />
Peter’s shoulders widened slightly, while his pectorals inflated a little bit, but not too much. His abdominals grew on his flat torso, and his arms grew a little more muscular. Within seconds, Peter actually grew three inches taller, and his arms grew longer as well!<br />
<br />
His legs were slightly longer, with a moderate amount of muscle being added to his quads and his calves. He was still slender, but he looked tall and athletic. <br />
<br />
Within seconds, Peter looked like the perfect swimmer. His hands and feet were slightly bigger, and Allen allowed him to grow just enough so that he could perform well while he was in the water.<br />
<br />
“Do… Do I look okay to you now, Coach?” Peter asked his coach sadly. The boy tried so desperately to please his coach in any way he could.<br />
<br />
For the moment, Steve couldn’t deny the fact that Peter now had a body, which was shaped perfectly for a member of the swim team. Peter was tall and slender, and he didn’t have too much bulk on his body. With big hands and feet, the boy looked like he was capable of leaving any other competitor in the dust. But, Steve wanted to keep his boys on their toes, and he didn’t want to show even a hint of being pleased with their looks or their performance.<br />
<br />
“Having a great swimmers’ body doesn’t mean anything, unless you’re spending at least three hours per day swimming laps in the pool!” Steve complained. “You guys think you can have everything the easy way without working for it…”<br />
<br />
Peter just stood quietly and listened to his coach’s complaints. Of course, Allen was listening in on Steve’s rants as well, and he was quickly running out of patience. Allen could see everything Peter saw and he could hear everything that Peter heard. <br />
<br />
“Man… I give you the most perfect body of any swimmer, ready to go to the Olympic Games, and he still isn’t satisfied! Wait, I think Steve needs to cool off and take another dip in the pool…” Allen said. Only Peter could hear Allen’s voice, of course. Allen was still able to make Peter do anything he wanted, and Allen had the power to shrink or grow any part of Peter’s body at will.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter felt a tingling in his groin. He looked down and panicked, when he realized that Allen had made his cock grow! His dick started to become hard at first, as it was pushing outward towards his Speedo. The front of his Speedo was sticking out like the top edge of a tent!<br />
<br />
“Let’s get rid of the Speedo…” Allen commanded inside of Peter’s head.<br />
<br />
In a flash, Peter’s Speedo vanished! He was standing there, completely naked!<br />
<br />
“What the….” Steve gasped, when he saw peter standing before him, in the nude.<br />
<br />
Peter’s six-inch cock slowly raised upward until it was pointing straight at Steve. Then, it began to grow rapidly!<br />
<br />
“Hey! Point that thing away from me!” Steve shouted.<br />
<br />
But, it was too late! Peter’s cock suddenly grew so long, that it reached Steve’s torso as it continued to push him back. Peter’s cock also grew thicker and stronger. It was now six inches wide and already 12 inches long!<br />
<br />
“Aaaaaaahhh!” Steve screamed. He was standing right by the edge of the pool, and he had nowhere to go! <br />
<br />
Peter’s cock was now 18 inches long… and growing…<br />
<br />
“Uhmmmmm” Peter groaned, due to the extreme pleasure he had felt, of his cock growing so quickly.<br />
<br />
Peter’s mighty cock continued to push against Steve’s stomach, causing the man to take another step back. He was now on the edge of the pool.<br />
<br />
Peter’s cock grew just a little longer, going from 22 to 30 inches. The giant cock head forced Steve to take another step back, forcing him to fall in the water for a third time!<br />
<br />
KA-PLUNCH!<br />
<br />
Peter opened his eyes for the moment, and realized that Steve had landed in the pool once again, thanks to his ever-growing cock! When he looked down, he noted that his six-inch dick had rapidly grown into a 30-inch monster, that was three inches in diameter!!<br />
<br />
Allen finally allowed his cock to quit growing when it reached the three-foot mark!<br />
<br />
He didn’t want Peter to have to listen to Steve’s ranting anymore, so he made Peter disappear and he teleported him to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Peter appeared standing right in front of Allen, who was pleased with his handiwork.<br />
<br />
“I had enough of Steve’s yelling and shouting, don’t you?” he chuckled.<br />
<br />
Peter looked straight in front of him. His cock had grown so big, that the tip of his manhood was now at eye level.<br />
<br />
“Wow… This thing is huge!” Peter grinned, as he admired his huge, three-foot-long cock.<br />
<br />
“Well, Steve was asking for it! I gave you the perfect swimmer’s body. Why, I could send you to the Olympics with a body like that! And he still didn’t look pleased!” Allen grumbled.<br />
<br />
Peter just turned slightly, as he watched his giant manhood as it slowly swung from side to side.<br />
<br />
“You like that thing, huh?” Allen laughed. He could tell that Peter was slightly aroused by walking around with a giant cock.<br />
<br />
“Well, we got the day off from class, so why don’t you just keep that cock for awhile?”<br />
<br />
Peter just stared at him in shock.<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sending you home. Enjoy you giant dick!” Allen chuckled.<br />
<br />
Allen just waved his hand, and Peter vanished into thin air. Seconds later, Peter appeared in his bedroom at Dustin’s house. He still had his 3-foot cock!<br />
<br />
What was he going to do with his monster manhood?</p>
