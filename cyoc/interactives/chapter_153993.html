<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dalton was a freshman in the school, 14 years old, who had first gotten into weight lifting at 12 and then decided later that year he wanted to follow in the footsteps of legends in the bodybuilding scene. While he wasn&#39;t involved in a sport at the school, he was a common sight at the weight room. He had a boyish, charming face, straw blond hair and slate grey eyes, thin glasses he&#39;d had to wear since 10, and a build he&#39;d honed through two years of exceedingly intense work. At 175 lbs, Dalton was easily one of the more ripped guys to come in to the school, though nowhere near as ripped as he&#39;d like to be.<br />
<br />
His shoulders pressed against most shirts he wore, and lent him a distinctly wide impression, which was a problem when his mother refused to send him to school in stringers - only ever in polos. Dalton&#39;s abs were his finest feature, basically etched on to him as if in stone, right below tight and muscular pectorals. His arms were strong and well toned, but never exceeded sixteen inches. His legs required a special size of shorts to hold his quads and thighs, and his diamond calves were a sight.<br />
<br />
In contrast to how buffed out he was, he had a rather bookish and shy personality. Never imposing on anyone, and always eager to give other nerdy guys a helping hand if they wanted into fitness.<br />
<br />
Dalton today was carrying three chicken wings, a small plate of steak, some carrots, and his once in three weeks indulgence of two pieces of chocolate cake, which brought John&#39;s attention to him. It looked like the campus&#39; young bodybuilder was due to really put on some size.<br />
<br />
As Dalton took his seat, he noted one of the cheerleaders took a seat near him, immediately feeling his arm. &quot;So...Dalton, you got a date for the prom two weeks from now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton had started eating his chicken when she engaged with him, adjusting his shirt a little from his pecs suddenly putting on a slight amount of size. &quot;Uhh...no? I don&#39;t think so. I mean, I&#39;m not very good at dancing. Kinda got a bit of mass going on. Makes me awkward.&quot; He blushed a little.<br />
<br />
The cheerleader looked at some of her girlfriends gathered nearby with a shocked expression. &quot;...you...don&#39;t? Oh, my name&#39;s Cheryl. I mean, if you&#39;d like to go out with me...&quot; Cheryl was a blond bombshell and one of the more popular senior girls.<br />
<br />
Dalton visibly halted and gulped, looking to the side, &quot;A-Again...I&#39;m not sure how good I&#39;ll be at dancing. I&#39;m a bodybuilder, not a-a...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheryl tried to assuage him, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll teach you the whole way...&quot; Cheryl let her hand drift down his shoulder to his back, all the way to his thigh.<br />
<br />
Dalton gasped slightly and nodded, &quot;...Y-Yeah...okay...I&#39;m good.&quot; With that Cheryl got up to chat with her girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Dalton for his part kept on eating his meal, deciding he needed to look even better than usual so as not to disappoint his date. As he ate one chicken wing and put the bones on his plate, his shoulders if anything bulked out further, swelling with size and strength, the bulk he&#39;d never been truly able to do without putting on fat finally coming on to him.<br />
<br />
His arms swelled slightly and he adjusted his sleeves, his abs pushing out a bit more and becoming slightly visible in his shirt.<br />
<br />
His legs toned up, but when he ate the next bit of chicken, they outright added muscle to such a level that they almost tore his shorts! Dalton adjusted his seat and swore these chairs weren&#39;t meant for a guy his size as his ass swelled in his shorts, toning and sizing up nicely.<br />
<br />
And as Dalton finished off the chicken and proceeded to wolf down the steak as well, he felt his back widen and his lats gain size and spread. His waist shrank as everything else around it grew wider and stronger, a muscular sight trick that most bodybuilders had going on.<br />
<br />
He devoured his carrots in short order, pushing up his youthly height of five foot six to six foot and beyond, resting nicely at six foot one as his clothes adjusted to his body and new height. Dalton felt slightly confused as his body finished toning up and swelling with muscle. By the end of it, his form was at 210 lbs easily, and the nerdy bodybuilder swore he felt even more brawny than he ever had before, even though that was kind of weird.<br />
<br />
Digging into his cake, Dalton&#39;s face matured from youthful boyishness to more of a male model&#39;s boyish look, a coquette masculinity / baby faced look well suited to lightly biting his lip and posing for a photo. His slate grey eyes intensified and even as his glasses stayed, they turned a stylish coal black, lending him a sort of &quot;athletic student&quot; vibe. His muscles all added just the slightest bit more tone and got a more thorough shave of body hair than he&#39;d ever had before.<br />
<br />
His hair restyled itself into a well combed, wavy look that perfectly complimented his beauteous appearance. At 17 going on 18 now, Dalton was known in the school for his promising future in bodybuilding, and even as he adjusted to the changes in time that the Chronivac accrued, he knew he and Cheryl were still due for that dance in just two weeks.<br />
<br />
Dalton got up and sighed, &quot;Way to go Dalton, two weeks to go and you gotta teach yourself to dance. Just gotta read some books...&quot; He swaggered out of the lunch room to go take care of that. Nobody had doubts Dalton could get it done. On top of his bodybuilding, he was quite the student around campus - two Honors classes wasn&#39;t as extreme as some of his fellow nerds, but it was a look at his capability.<br />
<br />
John decided to...</p>
