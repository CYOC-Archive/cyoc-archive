<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary's tiny ottsel stomach twisted with excitement as Eric began to drink his carbonated beverage.<br />
<br />
As soon as he took a large swallow of it, he knew something was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck... tastes like I got diet soda...&quot; Eric said in disgust, &quot;It's got that weird aftertaste.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric took a few more sips to confirm if it was the diet version of his favorite soda brand, but only succeeded in putting more of the potion into his body.  By the time he was 2/3rd's done his drink, he had put enough of the potion into him to start the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... I feel weird... like, it's all spinning.&quot;  Eric's head rolled around a bit like he had just gotten off a 3 hour marathon of a tilt-a-whirl.<br />
<br />
Mary squealed in delight, &quot;Don't worry, that will pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric did his best to keep himself from feeling dizzy and looked at Mary, &quot;What do you mean, did you put something in my soda?&quot;  Eric then looked down at his hands to find they were bristling out with orange/yellow fur.  The fur progressed up his arm quickly like a numbing feeling progressing around his body.  Taking off his t-shirt with a funny saying on it, he saw that his chest and torso was also become enveloped with the fur. His feet felt uncomfortable and he looked down, his shoes were filled with his rapidly expanding feet.  He tossed his shoes off with a great sigh of relief as his feet expanded to be disproportional to his increasingly fur-covered body.<br />
<br />
Unable to hold back her delight, Mary hugged his furry chest just in time for his face to rearrange and his skull reshape, forming a muzzle with a cold wet nose and his ears swhoop to the top of his head becoming fur covered and rounded, the rest of his head taking on a pattern of orange and yellow fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, I don't like this.  This feels... ugh... it... OUCH!  SOMETHING HURTS!&quot;  Eric didn't know it at the time, but it was his tail that was starting to hurt from being trapped in the fabric of his jeans.  Eric pulled down his pants a little and his thick tail shot out of the base of his spine and went right through the hole in the back of the chair.  He rubbed his hand along the furry appendage and feel a shiver travel down the length of his spine and then down his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sweetie, don't worry about it, you will like it. Trust me.  You will be small and cute, like me,&quot;  Mary said with a smile.  Eric's arms and legs started to alter at that point, his legs becoming shorter and his arms becoming thinner, making movement easy on either two legs or all four.  Not knowing what else do to, He removed his ill-fitting pants, he was covered up by fur, so decency wasn't even an issue.  Eric was at this point, an ottsel, but still human sized.<br />
<br />
Mary released from hugging Eric and jumped up on the table to get a better look at him, &quot;And now at this point you will become my size.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was panicking, &quot;Mary, I appreciate what you are trying to d- BURP!&quot;  Interrupted by the belch, Eric looked a little embarrassed.  &quot;But I don't want to be... CRASH!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at that point that Eric was interrupted by his chair breaking.  He stood up to find that he was taller than he used to be.  He was a good 8 feet tall now and looking down at Mary who was at loss of worked from the shock of Eric's sudden growth.  What was left of the chair was wedged on Eric's thick tail.<br />
<br />
Eric was steadily growing and a crowd was gathered in the food court, exchanging concerned whispers about what the creature was.  Mary finally found her ability to speak and said, &quot;Well, I guess... it g-got effected by the soda or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
At 10 feet tall, the chair fragments were starting to pinch Eric in his tail, a pain he has never felt before.  He swished his tail around, in hopes of flinging the chair off and in the process brought his tail down on a table smashing it under the weight.  This set the crowd off in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;THE CREATURE IS ATTACKING!  RUN!  EVERYONE GET OUT OF HERE!&quot;  The mob went running from the mall, floor by floor clearing out the shopping facility.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, stop, I'm not a monster, please!&quot; Eric pleaded.  The pleas fell on deaf ears as the crowd rushed away from the scene, leaving only Eric and Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary did her best to try and calm him, &quot;Don't worry Eric, we will figure this out!&quot;  She jumped on him and climbed her way up onto his shoulder.  The thought for a moment about the ludicrousness of it all, an ottsel standing on an ottsel's shoulder.  The only thing was, Mary was becoming relativity smaller as Eric grew and grew.  His growth speeding up.  10 feet, 15 feet, 25 feet, at 30 feet he hit his head on the very high ceiling of the mall and it didn't look like it was going to stop anytime soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, be careful, alright, it looks like I'm gonna outgrow this place.&quot;  Not wanting to hurt himself while growing, Eric used his hands to break apart some of the roof of the mall.  He was right about outgrowing the mall.  Mary was somewhere clinging to side of his neck as Eric continued his growth.<br />
<br />
He shot up being able to see the parking lot and all the cars driving away from the mall as everyone tried and distance themselves from the &quot;monster&quot;<br />
<br />
At 70 feet, Eric did his best to step out of the mall without causing anymore damage, he raised a leg high and set it down in the abandoned parking lot and began to try and get his other leg out without breaking any of the stores inside.  Unfortunately, he neglected to think about his tail as it cut through the building destroying a far chuck of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so not good...&quot; Eric though, he was now a 150 feet tall ottsel, looking down at buildings and cars that look like they were toys.  &quot;Mary?  Are you still there?&quot;  Eric heard muffled talking coming from his fur and assumed it was Mary.  &quot;What should we do now?&quot;</p>
