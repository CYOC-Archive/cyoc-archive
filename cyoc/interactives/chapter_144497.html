<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Dennis Dane for his help. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allen was a little confused as to why he was standing in a men&#39;s room when he had just been at a gathering of the local youth minstry. His admittedly hazy and confused memories weren&#39;t helping, as images of a walk in the park with someone filtered in and out. <br />
<br />
He turned to the sink and splashed some cold water on his face, trying to clear his troubled mind of a lingering urge to be with...Dani? That didn&#39;t make sense, as they were just friends, and she was a woman. Right?<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question was prompted by another flash of memory, this time of himself...kissing a woman? He was starting to get scared, and decided maybe finding Dani wasn&#39;t the worst thing to do at the moment. She might be able to help him sort out what was going on.<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Allen came out of the men&#39;s room, and started to go around the building, not fully aware of why he knew Dani was on the other side. But then something came into his view that changed his path forward completely.<br />
<br />
It was a poster hung on the building that housed the restrooms for men and women. More specifically, it was a poster for the latest Garrett Garner film called &#39;Throwback Throwdown&#39;. Scenes of fighting and motorcycling surround the center image of its star wearing his signature leather jacket over his shirtless chest, letting everyone get a good look at his chiseled abs and pecs. <br />
<br />
Allen, in an effort to ward off certain lingering traces of the feelings of another..him, stared at the Garrett Garner poster. He was rewarded by a sudden stiffening in his brown shorts, a reassuring sign of his attraction to men. However, he didn&#39;t realize that this comfort came at the cost of retriggering the &#39;were breeder&#39; curse he carried and was now doomed to transform once again into a hetero stereotype.<br />
<br />
But it wouldn&#39;t be another spell as Lennard, the youh ministry leader. Instead, he was to become someone of a distinctly retro style...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
The changes began with Allen&#39;s brown shorts. Almost immediately, they began to grow down his legs, turning a deep blue in process. As they neared his ankles, the material shifted from cotton to denim, The new jeans hung loose on his skinny legs for a moment until muscles mass surged and pulled them tight. The new him was going to need strong legs, perfect for standing on for extended periods of time.<br />
<br />
Around Allen&#39;s waist, a thick leather belt was starting to slid into place, and cinched itself tight. Just below its huge metal buckle adorned with musical notes, his groin pulsed and pushed forward with a surge of growth, his still semi-erect cock gaining inches. This was complimented by a squaring of his buttocks with muscle, causing more tightness. <br />
<br />
The tops of Allen&#39;s Converse came in contact with his new jeans and began to transform themselves. Laces disappeared as the footwear sealed itself up, the white canvas giving way to black leather. Soon thick heels emerged from the back of the almost formed engineer&#39;s boots whose tops were hidden by black denim. Inside of them, his feet cracked and popped larger, his right beginning to tap up and down in time to some unheard rhythm.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Nearby at a small public stage in the park, posters began rolling themselves up all over. At first, the lettering and images on them were blurry, but came into sharper focus with each passing moment. <br />
<br />
On the stage, sound equipment began rolling into place. Speakers seemed to rise out of the floor, as did a microphone on its stand. With lost of creaking and bending of metal, a pair of chairs from the floor were pulled up onto stage, twisting into themselves into a pair of tall stools behind the mic stand.<br />
<br />
As these changes completed themselves, people began to filter into the area around the stage. They mingled and chatted as they seemed to be waiting for someone to arrive...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Allen was a bit horrified once he saw the changes to his lower body. But only a little as the curse had already begun to warp his mind from a young gay man into someone distinctly more hetero. <br />
<br />
Confused by his changing thoughts, he tried to turn back towards the bathroom but his new legs had their own idea of where he needed to go. With a steady and confident stride, they carried him away, and towards a certain stage nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;W...w..what&#39;s happening to ME?&quot;<br />
<br />
The last word came out deeper than he&#39;d expected as his voice dropped a few octaves to gain a manly quality to it. This seemed to be the signal for the transformation of his upper body to begin in earnest.<br />
<br />
His green turtleneck was pulled tight by surges of muscles in his arms and torso. As the material strained to contain the sudden grown, the weave became thinner and thinner, shifting to a dark grey cotton that clung tightly to his changing body. The cuffs that formed at his wrists began to roll up his forearms, as pattern of black ink rose up on them. The forming tattoos were of musical notes intertwined with motorcycles. His hands also grew bigger, with the distinct calluses of a skilled guitar player forming on his thick digits.<br />
<br />
Around his neck, a collar unfolded itself out of the transformed turtleneck, letting his thickening neck been seen with his adam&#39;s apple bobbing up and down. A pair of gold chain looped around his neck, dropping down across his now massive pecs which had caused the top buttons of his dress shirt to come undone. <br />
<br />
Inside his head, Allen was struggling to keep up with the flood of new memories and knowledge the curse was pouring into him. Years of lessons piled on top of a growing natural talent for music, pushing out any lingering attraction to men. But this void was quickly filled by images of women screaming his name. Or at least it sounded like his name. But he wasn&#39;t called Aaron...<br />
<br />
As he coped with this realization, his long hair was beginning to change. An unseen pair of scissors began to trim it shorter and shorter. What remained grew thicker and slicked itself back into a semi-pompdour, complimented by the thick sideburns that erupted from his now squared jaw. His nose cracked larger, just above a pair of thickening lips that curled into a cocky grin. He blinked once, twice as his brown eyes turned a clear blue. <br />
<br />
His hands reached out and grabbed something from the air. It was a thick leather biker jacket, just like the one his buddy Garrett Garner wore. He slipped his arms into it, feeling comfortable with its weight.  An electric acoustic guitar on a strap now hung from his back and he instinctively slid it forward to strum a little on its strings.<br />
<br />
&quot;~Oh baaaaby...~&quot;<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
As the transformed Allen neared the stage, the gathered crowd began to cheer and chant. It parted to allow the artist to mount the stage and sit on one of the two stools. <br />
<br />
&quot;AARON...AARON...AARON...&quot;<br />
<br />
The retrowave music star Aaron Adams raised a hand to hush the cheering throngs of his fans, and turned to face his back-up band.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, boys. Let&#39;s start wit&#39; a little bit of rhythm and blues...&quot;</p>
