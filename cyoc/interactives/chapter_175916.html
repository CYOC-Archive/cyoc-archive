<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Finally home&quot; sighed Connor as he tossed the book on his desk. He had been up and out of his appartment since 6 am this morning, and it was already 11 am. Due to some issues he had to handle this morning, he had managed to actually accomplish a few extra things since it gave him the excuse he needed to leave his appartment. One of those tasks was to pick out a book to read, as mandated by his work in their new &quot;read a good book&quot; campaign that his bosses came up with to &quot;improve workplace happiness&quot; somehow. Honestly he didn&#39;t get it at all. But he still had to comply since his managers were just looking for any excuse to demote him after he had snitched to HR and the higher ups about their lack of a work ethic. In other words, showing up and doing nothing but disturbing their tasks to their own subordinates while the 3 of them chatted in the break room.<br />
<br />
To counter this, Connor picked up an introductory book about the universe as it would be incredibly easy to make it really boring to listen to his &quot;summary&quot;, and likely just allow him to be skipped in the upcoming &quot;share and tell&quot; portion. The one downside though, was that it was also incredibly boring to read. He bairly managed to make 30 pages into it when he was on the verge of quitting. However he really needed this job. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me this is so god damn boring to read! Why can&#39;t they make them, I don&#39;t know, better? If this was up to me, I would just right in a few false statments here and there, just to keep it interesting&quot; ranted Connor to himself. &quot;Like for example&quot; said connor while grabbing a pencil. &quot;What if I were to cross off this part here about how human males and females have different sexual body parts, and changed it to human males have all of the human sexual body parts and human females have the sexual body parts of various animals.&quot; He then moved down the page a bit and made another edit. &quot;And with that change, we can change here to state that &quot;humans reproduce by having sex with eachother, however when a human male fucks a human female, or the inverse, the offspring is the same species as of either the pussy it came out of or the cock that impregnated them, and in addition, human males can have sex with any other creature capable of a similar style of sex, and fits if on the receiving end&quot;.<br />
<br />
Connor laughed at his work, admiring how he was right in that it would have made this book so much more enjoyable to read. He had not yet realized that he was now sitting a bit further away from the desk, so that his large breasts didn&#39;t have to lay on top of it. Nor did he realize that he now looks and sounds like a woman, only one with a cock and balls between her legs as well as a pussy. It wasn&#39;t until she stood up to stretch that she finally noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; Shouted Connor as she grabbed her boobs out of shock. &quot;Ow! Fuck.&quot; Connor quickly looseded her tight grasp on her now throbbing boobs, massaging them in hopes to releave the pain. &quot;What the hell is going on with me? Why the... how the fuck am I a girl all of a sudden?&quot; Looking around her room, it still was mostly the same, however there were several notable changes too. The biggest one being the massive collection of different shaped dildos literally pouring out of her closet. They were in all shapes and sized, from small stubby ones, to massive horse cocks, to thin ones with a bit of a curl to their shape, kind of like a drill bit. On many of them, she saw that at the base opposit of the head, was a copy of their respective shape&#39;s pussy, with a hole for fucking. Only some had it though. <br />
<br />
Next to her bed, there was a nightstand with 3 pictures. One of her family, her pets, and a new one of some other girl whom she didn&#39;t recognize, but apparently was close to since it was in a heart shaped frame and all. The most noticeable attribute about this girl was the massive buldge she had running down her left thigh. Seeing it made Connor&#39;s own crotch tingle a bit in excited anticipation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute. Did my edits actually change the universe?&quot; Connor looked back down to the book and quickly erased what he had done. This time, he paid special attention to his body, and watched it return back to normal. &quot;Now that is interesting.&quot; Connor quickly pulled his left hand away from his chest as he realized that he was still rubbing where his breast would have just been. He checked himself over again just to confirm he was back to normal, and looked down at the book. <br />
<br />
Hesitantly, he tried making an edit again. &quot;All humans have boobs&quot; was what he wrote over the part about how only human females have breasts. The moment his pencil stopped writting, Connor coukd feel the same weight hanging off his chest. He had just watched as the pair of large breasts pushed themselves out into existence on his own chest without even feeling it until they settled. This time, he slowly and gently grabbed one, feeling it from both sides. It felt nice, but a bit heavier than he had expected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even my top gets changed too&quot; noted Connor as he stared down his admittedly amazing cleavage displayed by the tight, low cut top. &quot;Hmm, if it can do all of this, what can&#39;t I do with it?&quot; He flipped through a few pages, not choosing to undo his breasts for the mean time, as he kind of liked how it felt to have them, at least for now. &quot;Lets see....&quot;</p>
