<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Synopsis: Greenwood University was the most peculiar college in the country. For an outsider, it seemed fine enough, as colleges go. The only noticeable different was the fact that nobody seemed to give a fuck about their grades. Even the &quot;nerds&quot;, who were few and far between at Greenwood, seemed more interested in hooking up than acing their classes.<br />
<br />
On his first day of his freshman year, Zach meets a fleet of odd characters, including his... &quot;Interesting&quot; roomie. Blake is the polar opposite of Zach, with huge, bulging muscles and his open-minded acceptance of Zach&#39;s attraction to him. It&#39;s going to be a good year at Greenwood with the two of them together. Who knows? Maybe it&#39;ll be stronger than a simple roommate friendship... Or something much, Mich stronger ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zach was walking down the hall to his dorm on his first day of freshman year in college, eager to meet his roommate. His stomach was growling from the long ride, but he couldn&#39;t get anything else to eat. He was on a strict diet from when he was on the swim team, and he ate dinner before he left. Hopefully, his roommate is a cool guy, or girl. He heard this school has mixed dorms to save money and space. He&#39;d be fine with whatever. He just hopes they aren&#39;t too hot. He&#39;d never get anything done if that was true.<br />
<br />
“202, 204, 206…” he muttered to himself, looking for his room. He passed a couple open doors that he looked into. He saw one muscle stud guy working out with weights that weighed more than he was, but was lifting them like dumbbells. He saw a guy who looked to be about 260 lbs, an even mix of fat and muscle, being massages by a girl with bigger boobs than her head. He passed by two sexy girls making out, half naked. The door slammed shut before he got a good look, so he kept going.<br />
<br />
“213, 215... Ah, 217.” he had found his room. The door was slightly cracked open, and he heard soft grunting. Bracing for what he&#39;d find in there, he took a breath and walked in. There was two beds of equal sizes, a desk in between them, a kitchen area to the left, and a bathroom to the right. On one of the beds, his roommate was there. He was a rippling muscle-hunk, barely contained in his tight shirt. He was on his phone, casually popping his pecs to a beat coming from his headphones. He had a sharp, chiseled face, dark brown hair, deep blue eyes, and had a blue tank top on with some cutoff Jean shorts that seemed to be on the verge of bursting. He would have came right then and there if he hadn&#39;t noticed Zach had came in<br />
<br />
“Uh, h-hello…” he said, embarrassed, realizing he had been staring at him for at least a minute. “Oh, hey. You must be my new roommate. I’m Blake”, the stud said, jumping off the bed with a bound and shaking his hand, which was about twice the size of mine. “Yeah, I-I’m, uh… Z-Zach…” he literally had no idea what he was doing, because he was transfixed by his tight shirt hugging his massive pecs and ripped abs. Blake must have noticed or something, because he responded with: “Oh, sorry, I’ll go put something more appropriate on. Make yourself at home.” He headed over to his drawer to pull out some clothes, then headed to the bathroom to change.<br />
<br />
Zach noticed that Blake had made his side of the room completely dedicated to his sense of design. There were gym posters of big buff dudes all over the left side of the room, a set of home weights in the corner, and posters of the college mascot, The GreenWood Bulls. With some of the guys Zach had seen in this college, “Bulls” is accurate. The mascot nearly made him a furry the second he saw it. It was so buff, it seemed like he would have a hard time to move. <br />
<br />
The right side of the room, Zach&#39;s side, was completely barren, the bed still covered with the school sheets, adorned with that buff as hell mascot, Buffy the Bull. God, was he hot. Anyways, Zach had some stuff to unpack. He had three big drawers for all his stuff and the right side of the desktop for his things. He unpacked, refolded, and put away his clothes, laid his PC on the desktop, and put up a poster for Gary The Fighter, Zach&#39;s favorite childhood character. Again, Gary was rather muscular, yet had quite a big belly. The actor was 40 when the show aired, so he was about middle aged, meaning he had that late-age Dad Bod. Still, looking back on the show, he was sexy as hell. He only now realized how big his erection really was.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I used to love that show,” Blake said, coming out of the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Zach flipped over as fast as he could to hide his boner from him, yet Blake said, “Oh, stop, I saw it when you walked in.” It kind of make him feel better, but Zach still didn&#39;t move. He was dressed in a baggy Greenwood sweater and sweats, hiding his goldy muscles, much to Zach&#39;s dismay. “I-I’m sorry, I-” he began to say, but blake just shushed me and said, “I said it’s okay. It isn&#39;t my first time turning on a roommate.” He gave a cheesy but well-meaning smile, which eased the tension in the room (but not the tension in his pants). Zach turned back over, his boner had subsided enough to be “casual”. Blake dressed in loose clothing helped ease the urge, and his coolness with it helped me relax, but Zach still had the urge to cover up with a pillow or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I got important things to do, so, why don&#39;t you familiarize yourself with the room?&quot; Blake said, before grabbing a duffel bag and heading out.</p>
