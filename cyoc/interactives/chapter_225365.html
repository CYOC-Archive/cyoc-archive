<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I guess it makes sense to swap back considering how I don’t need to be you on Saturday,” Miles responded absentmindedly, “and from the fact that I already found the infiltrator…“<br />
<br />
“You found the mole! That’s great!” James exclaimed. “That means you accomplished what you needed to before the end of the week.”<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Miles thought. He hadn’t meant to tell James so early. He was hoping to tell him later but had accidentally blurted it out.<br />
<br />
“How about this? After work we meet up and have Phillip take us back to your mansion. Does it sound like a plan?” James earnestly asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure. I’ll meet you at the front entrance.” Miles answered. He gave James a simple wave as he stepped back into the elevator. On the way down, Miles couldn’t help but feel a tad despondent. Surely he should be thrilled to return to his alpha body and wealthy lifestyle. More so on the fact that he had uncovered the asshole leaking his company’s information. But he couldn’t feel a bit sad knowing he was leaving this twink intern body.<br />
<br />
“What am I thinking?” Miles thought and gave his head a furious shake. “I think I’ve been Shamrock for a little too long.” Exiting the elevator, Miles got back to his usual intern duties.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, James was also feeling a bit down in the dumps. Although he was happy for Miles and the successful mission, he wasn’t sure if he was quite ready to go back to being James. “No! I need to remember… that was my old… No! Original life!” He thought as slapped his cheeks lightly.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I’ve gotten too accustomed to being Miles” James thought as he got back to work and ignored all his subconscious thoughts on how much he was going to miss being in the masculine powerful body he currently resided in.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Miles looked at his phone as he secretly viewed everyone leaving the building. Currently coworkers, they would go back to being his employees on Monday. As the janitorial team arrived and began making their way through the building, Miles patiently waited in the lobby.<br />
<br />
After nearly waiting an hour, Miles heard the elevator door opens as James stepped out.<br />
<br />
“Sorry I took so long. I had a lot of work to do.”<br />
<br />
“No problem. I was perfectly fine waiting longer.” Miles told him as the two made their way out of the building. They found Phillip waiting for them and after letting them inside, took them back to Miles’ mansion.<br />
<br />
James made sure to thank Phillip before unlocking the doors. As the three entered, Miles and James made their way over to the special room. Leaving their belongings on the floor, Miles made his way to the dresser to find the magic ring. His heart dropped when he didn’t find the ring anywhere within the socks.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! I think I lost the ring! Now what are we going to do?” Miles shouted, filled with dread.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. I hid the ring in the closet.” James said as he hunched down and pulled a box out of the closet.<br />
<br />
“What’s the ring doing there and not where I hid it?” Miles asked feeling more relieved than suspicious.<br />
<br />
“Oh that…” James coughed. “I can explain it later… after we swap back.”<br />
<br />
Miles merely shrugged feeling content enough with the fact that the ring wasn’t missing. He placed the ring on his finger. “Alright. Let’s get this over with.”<br />
<br />
Miles began to undress and found himself observing his old body and how James sexually removed his clothing. Making eye contact with James, Miles returned his gaze to his new body.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, James had been doing the same. He was watching Miles as he slowly began to remove his clothing and reveal his body before making eye contact.<br />
<br />
The room was filled with a strange atmosphere as the two continued to undress and secretly observe one another. Before long Miles found himself only in his white briefs before pulling them down to reveal his unimpressive flaccid dick and his small red bush. <br />
<br />
Having his new twink body naked and on display for another person made Miles feel extremely vulnerable. Especially when the other person was his old body. But he couldn’t lie that it also gave him a slight thrill.<br />
<br />
James had also been in the process in removing his boxer briefs when he saw Miles remove his underwear. Enamored with the cute twink’s body, it took a slight jolt from his dick to return to his task at hand. James slid down his boxers and released his large salami of a cock free as it swinged side to side from the sudden motion.<br />
<br />
Completely nude, Miles and James walked back toward each other and stood face to face. For a few seconds, no one said anything as they looked at one another. Miles examined his original body in awe, his hairy pecs directly in his face. The huge, hairy, and beefy body in front of him filled him with excitement as he took extra notice of his impressive dick.<br />
<br />
James had to glance down to look at Miles and view his old body as he acknowledge the cute bottom in front of him. He caught sight of his plump and scrumptious butt and noticed how tasty the twink looked.<br />
<br />
Finally looking up, Miles made eye contact with James. “Uh… you… sh-sh-should probably get on the… uh… bed now.” Miles stammered.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Right!” James said as he wandered over to the bed and laid on top of it. He positioned himself on his back as he felt his large dick beginning to erect.<br />
<br />
Miles couldn’t get over how attractive his old body looked to him, even more now that James was naked. He wasn’t sure if it was his new body influencing him or if he had simply become enamored with his old body. Freeing himself from his thoughts, Miles refused to believe he was become more like a submissive bottom from being in James’ body.<br />
<br />
James watched as Miles walked over to him and climbed on to the bed before sitting in front of his erect cock. Just as they had done before, Miles would have to ride his old dick.<br />
<br />
“Good thing I thought ahead and fucked Shamrock in this position.” Miles thought as he  began to lick his fingers to prepare himself. “I’m not sure sure what would’ve happened to my mental state if I found myself in any submissive sex positions.”<br />
<br />
James watched Miles closely as he watched his old body suck on his fingers. His dick begged for pleasure and it was taking some self control from pinning Miles to the bed and fucking him nonstop. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could withstand from having sex in this body, especially with the perfect bottom in front of him.<br />
<br />
Miles wasn’t going to get fucked raw so he decided to prepare himself. He didn’t want James’ fingers anywhere near his ass this time as he quickly remember how nice the thick fingers entered him before. Perishing the thought, Miles refused to let James be anymore dominant than he had to be.<br />
<br />
Miles braced himself as he inserted his fingers into his ass. Playing with his ass yesterday definitely helped as he found it much easier to accept his fingers inside. Letting out a few moans, Miles continued to finger himself as he quickly inserted and redacted his fingers. His small dick was fully hard now and he felt his 4-inch equipment leaking pre-cum as he prepared himself.<br />
<br />
“Woah! When did Miles get so good at this?” James thought as he watched Miles. “It almost reminds me of myself… right before I played with my sex toys.” The whole scene was definitely making James more horny as he felt himself becoming more impatient.<br />
<br />
“Ok… I-I-I’m ready.” Miles said nervously as he stood up and placed his ass over James’ dick. With a deep breath, he swooped down and inserted the entire thing at once. “Augh!” Miles exclaimed as he felt the large dick fill him up completely.<br />
<br />
The moment he had been waiting for finally came as James felt Miles’ tight hole swallow his cock. Properly wet, the hole felt perfect as he watched Miles slowly lift himself off before re-entering his cock.<br />
<br />
As Miles began to ride his former dick and fuck himself he realized how much he had been craving this. He wasn’t sure if it was from the daydream from yesterday, but he had longed for his old body to fuck him. “I wished he could fuck me from behind… and fuck me so hard to the point I don’t have any control.” Miles thought. These new thoughts came easily to him as his submissive nature was calling to him. More surprisingly, Miles was beginning to accept it. This time he didn’t even dismiss the thoughts as he was too preoccupied riding dick to notice.<br />
<br />
The whole thing felt so good that James couldn’t keep himself from letting out a few deep moans. How long had he wanted this? He remembered the vision he had when he masturbated but never knew he desired it this badly. James kept his hands under his head as to restrain himself from grabbing Miles. If he didn’t he knew he would soon find himself flipping Miles over and beginning to try a myriad of rough sex positions on the twink.<br />
<br />
Miles looked down at his pathetic dick and balls as they bounced to the rhythm of his riding, leaving small amounts of pre-cum on James’ stomach. Looking at his smooth pale body, Miles could only notice the stark contrast with James’ tanned and hairy self. He felt James’ rough body hair as he landed and began to rub his hands over the hirsute man, embracing the rough hair.<br />
<br />
James felt Miles caressing him as he plowed his finger through his body hair. Seeing the mostly hairless twink admire his hairy body made James even more excited as he felt his dick closer on edge.<br />
<br />
Despite currently being a bottom, Miles realized that he had a pretty good amount of control at the moment. He didn’t find himself in a single submissive position and was fucking his ass at his own rate. Expecting to be proud, Miles felt odd realizing the slight hint of disappointment he felt. For some reason, that he couldn’t explain, he craved something more rough and something he had less… control over.<br />
<br />
James was also having similar thoughts as he felt a similar pang of dissatisfaction at not being able to hold and firmly fuck Miles. He wanted more than anything to grab Miles, lock his hands, and begin to roughly fuck him. Noting how odd these thoughts were for him, James tried to focus on the pleasure coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
Miles looked at James’ chest and observed the hairy pecs he had been so enthralled over the past few days. Lowering his head, he gave them a squeeze and felt their firmness as he softly massaged them between his fingers, feeling every hair. Now closer to James’, he smelled the familiar scent of his old body’s musk enter his nose as he got more aroused. <br />
<br />
“Strange. I never really noticed nor cared how I smelled before but now I just can’t seem to get enough of it.” Miles thought as he gripped James hairy pecs and took a deep whiff of his original body. “The smell seems to drive me crazy and only make me more horny.”<br />
<br />
As if to prove it, he felt himself edging closer to the end as he begin to fasten his pace. Letting his hands go, Miles found himself fucking himself quicker as he inserted the dick as deep as it could go. It wasn’t too long before he came. Barely able to hold it, Miles let out his load all over James’ hair body. Ironically, mostly over his chest. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, James had been on edge for a long time and seeing Miles release was just the last key he needed as he began to cum. He felt his large cock cumming inside Miles, releasing a nice load within him and filling him nicely with his seed.<br />
<br />
Miles felt the warm fluid inside him as he pulled himself off James and felt his large cock fall out. The cum quickly exited his hole and fell on James and the bedsheets as he tiredly fell to the side of James. Warm cum continuing to fall out of his ass.<br />
<br />
James pulled Miles closer as he yawned and closed his eyes. He wasn’t sure why but having sex always tired him out.<br />
<br />
The two dozed off once more as the ring glowed.</p>
