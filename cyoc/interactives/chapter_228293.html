<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After an intense workout, Jay always took a shower. His girlfriend would always complain if he came back smelling like sweat. The smell of the gym was supposed to stay at the gym. He tossed his clothes into his gym bag and then pulled out his towel. However, his eyes hung on that bottle of pills. &quot;Only one every three days...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay opened up the bottle and took out one of the pills. With how nondescript it was, he was almost worried that it could have been anything. The small white tablet barely had no labels on it. Not even how many mg were in it. &quot;Collin doesn&#39;t lie...&quot; Jay reasoned with himself, then popped it in his mouth.<br />
<br />
After grabbing his bodywash and shampoo, Jay headed to the shower. He turned on the faucet and moved to the side to wait for it to warm up. &quot;Eh?&quot; Jay looked down over his muscular body to see his dick starting to swell. The average sized member usually didn&#39;t wake up like this when he was in public. At the same time, Jay couldn&#39;t deny the strong feeling of arousal also take him over. He was just glad he was alone in the long ceramic hall of the public shower.<br />
<br />
Jay&#39;s eyes darted back towards the entrance. Still no one was there. A bit of embarrassment flooded him as he watched to make sure no one was coming. His hand gently massaged the member only encouraging the excitement he was feeling. Jay grabbed his bodywash and started to lather it on his body. Spreading it over his hands, arms and shoulders were fine. However, as he went over his nipples, his body shivered. The semi-erect cock went full mast.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Jay cursed as he panted. His eyes darted back to the entrance of the shower. Still no one. With a sigh of relief, he continued. His big hands focused more on his pecs than normal. That little shiver was better than he expected. And for some reason it almost felt like there was more to wash. If not for the excitement of his penis, he might have noticed just how much they had grown. Nor did he notice that was true of the rest of his body as well.<br />
<br />
As a fairly athletic man, Jay was always pretty buff. The light dusting of abs and noticeable pecs with strong looking arms and legs, he wasn&#39;t exactly unaware that he looked good. Right now all those years of hard work were starting to almost double. Of course he didn&#39;t realize it in the slightest. As his heart pounded veins started to push out of his skin. With each pump of blood, his body began to grow.<br />
<br />
Of course, Jay was far more focused on the arousal. He couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. Even the slightest touch of his cock nearly sent him to his knees. He fell against the wall and cringed. His cock throbbed again, begging for any sort of touch. If Jay moved, he was surely going to fall. His fingers clawed at the green ceramic squares lining the shower&#39;s walls. He winced and moaned as he felt the edge of his climax.<br />
<br />
Each second felt like an eternity. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about his cock. It was so hard. So sensitive. He wanted so badly to touch it. Or have someone else. Anyone would do. &quot;F-fuck...&quot; he cried out as he painted the wall white. His hips thrust over and over again as cum sprayed out of his cock. Everything went on autopilot as the overwhelming pleasure of release covered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; Jay murmured as he saw the mess he&#39;d made. The gym had a very clear rule against cumming in the shower. It supposedly clogged the drain. If not for the pride on how much of a mess he&#39;d made, Jay might have felt the slightest hint of embarrassment over what had just happened. He just took water running down him and splashed it against the wall, hiding the deed. In the need to &#39;fix&#39; his mistake, Jay didn&#39;t notice the scratches in the tile where his hands had been. Small slits cut into the ceramic against the wall and the floor.<br />
<br />
Jay finished up his shower, grabbed his towel and headed back to change into his normal clothes. His eyes caught a full length mirror as he did so. &quot;Damn...&quot; he was shocked at first, but it quickly turned into a confident grin. He raised his arm and gave it a flex. The bicep was noticeably bigger. Not much, but he&#39;d flexed for himself so many times that he knew that there had to be close to a quarter inch added if not a half inch. Same was true of his pecs that were far more defined. They pushed a bit further out and were out.<br />
<br />
His eyes stopped on the small sprouting golden hair that was covering them. What had been nearly completely bare, now had the inkling of hair on his chest and running down his abs. It was true of his arms and even his legs. The dark brown hair that had always covered his legs now had a bit more blond in it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?!?&quot; Jay was so distracted that he almost didn&#39;t even notice beard running across his face. It looked to have grown nearly three or four days worth of hair in the matter of minutes. His girlfriend always said she hated the way it felt so he made sure to trim it everyday. &quot;Who cares what she thinks...&quot; he smirked at his handsome reflection, then flexed again, watching his muscles bulge.</p>
