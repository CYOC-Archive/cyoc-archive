<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With darkness falling and a storm fast approaching Sam guided the yacht toward a nearby cove which they had passed by when they circled the island. The cove would give the yacht the most protection from the storm which was already beginning to lash the palm trees which lined the sandy shoreline and caused the ship to rock back and forth. Once they entered the cove the waves didn’t hit as hard, but it was still causing the ship to rock back and forth.<br />
“Drop the anchors.” Ordered Sam as two anchors where dropped one in the front of the ship better known as the bow and a smaller one from the rear of the ship or the stern. <br />
<br />
“Damn…look at that rain.” Said Mike as the nine of them gathered in the main galley of the ship.<br />
<br />
“One of the worse storms I have ever seen.” Stated Sam as he walked down the stairs from the upper deck where the controls for the ship was. “Like I said…I wouldn’t have wanted to attempt to sail through this.”<br />
<br />
“I can see that.” Stated his girlfriend Taylor as she pointed outside the cove where massive white top waves lashed the shore. The cove had a slight S shape entrees which protected them from the water.<br />
<br />
“I don’t like being this close to shore like I said this screams horror movie to me.” Stated Nate<br />
<br />
“No arguments there.” Confirmed Rose as she stood beside him. “An unknown…uncharted island and a storm suddenly appears?”<br />
<br />
“Storms form all the time and we are a good 30 yards from shore in the middle of a cove which is 40 plus feet deep, we will be fine for a day.” Stated Sam<br />
<br />
“And the sudden appearance of an island?” counted Kelly as her chocolate brown skin and jet-black curly hair made her stand out a bit. If that didn’t her no nonsense and blunt personality would have done it. “How do you fucking explain that?” <br />
<br />
“I can’t.” admitted Sam “And my satellite phone isn’t working, must be the storm.”<br />
<br />
That news got everyone worried, even as lightning flashes illuminated the sea and surrounding land.<br />
<br />
“We still have the radio and I have done a radio check…we are good.” Reassured Sam<br />
<br />
“Well…why don’t we eat and hang out for a bit.” Offered Amanda as she brought forth some freshly cooked orange chicken and rice from the kitchen and placed it down on the table. Amanda was an amazing cook and sitting down enjoying some food and some drinks, beer or wine got everyone mind off the storm which had lightened a bit but was still howling outside. <br />
<br />
“Get some sleep everyone, Sam and I will take the first watch.” Reassured Taylor, that was the system they had whenever they weren’t at a dock each couple would take turns on watch, two hours each. Amanda being the only single person onboard enjoyed the privilege of not having to do a watch. <br />
<br />
The boat rocked and rolled but after a long day at sea, everyone aside from Taylor and Sam went to sleep. It was just past 2am when a knock at the door awoke Rose and Nate from their sleep.<br />
<br />
“You two are up.” Stated a tried Stacy as the two of them got out of bed. Not really wanting to go padding around the ship in underwear both of them slipped back into their bathing suits. Nate into his black and orange swim trunks and Rose into her pink/red bikini, she did wrap a towel around her waste like normal before they left their cabin. They had been wearing them almost none stop since starting this vacation. Together they went to the wheelhouse above the main galley. Sitting in the captain’s chair waiting on them was Mike, his girlfriend Stacy who had woken them up was up there as well. The storm had passed for the most part but lightning still lights up the sky in the distance. <br />
<br />
“So anything interesting happen?” inquired Nate with a yawn<br />
<br />
“No…” said Mike, like Nate he was in his swim deep forest green trunks <br />
<br />
“Well I think I saw a dolphin.” Stated Stacy as she sat in a chair in her own golden bikini but like Rose she had a towel around her waist, as she closed her book. “Heard a tale splash the surface, other than that, no.”<br />
<br />
“So a calm night.” Stated Rose “Well go get some sleep, we will wake Kelly and Kenny in two hours and then in the morning we can head out of here and back on our planned vacation.”<br />
<br />
“Amen to that.” Said Mike as he and Stacy disappeared down the stairs leaving Nate and Rose alone in the pilot house. <br />
<br />
Down below, in the smallest cabin Amanda awoke to the sound of singing. She was the only person who wasn&#39;t part of a couple and therefor was alone, she had the smallest room but shared it with no one.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” inquired Amanda as she heard singing but found no source of the sound but it sounded so beautiful. She headed toward the door only to stop before turning back around and picking up her swimsuit from where it hung. She slipped it on and headed out into the darkened hallway. The ship was still rocking a bit but she paid it no mind as she followed the sound of singing upwards to the galley. <br />
<br />
She paused for a moment, hearing Rose and Nate talking above her in the lighted pilot house but instead she followed the singing, it was so beautiful that she didn’t even notice that it was more then one person singing, it was multiple people both male and female and it was coming from outside. She stepped out the sliding back door and onto the back deck before moving to the edge of the end of the boat. There was a small wooden deck which sat at the water level. She sat on the edge of the wooden deck with her feet in the water. <br />
<br />
“Come with us…you belong to the sea…join us and be forever free.” sung the multiple voices as Amanda spotted five or six figures in the darkened water. They where close, close enough to touch her and they reached out with human hands but they where not human…her mind processed this but failed to notice as she slipped into the water and disappeared.<br />
<br />
Back on the pilot house Rose turned her head and looked out into the darkness as multiple load smacking sound filled the air. In the dark she thought she saw two or three fins coming out of the water.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” inquired Nate, as he paused the movie they had been watching an his laptop.<br />
<br />
“Dolphins it seams.” Said Rose with a shrug before restarting the movie.</p>
