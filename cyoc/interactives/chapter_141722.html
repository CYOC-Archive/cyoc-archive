<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don&#39;t remember much of that night, between the four women all vying for me to fuck their various holes and Lara sitting gleefully on the side lines the activities went long into the night until the early morning. I was honestly surprised no neighbors complained about the noise because we weren&#39;t exactly subtle. Su may have been quiet as could be but Aubrey made no secret that she loved my dick, my balls, and every molecule that came from it. Sophia occasionally screamed out Spanish lingo whenever I made her climax, and Charity would simply moan and scream often while biting her lip. I don&#39;t know how long I lasted or when we finally passed out but I remember Saturday morning and to say I was content, well... I wish I could say that. <br />
<br />
I woke up the sight of a typical dorm ceiling, feeling sore and fatigued. I had to blink a couple of times to try and get rid of the blurriness only to realize that my lack of eyewear was what caused it. &quot;Good morning baby,&quot; Lara cooed. I looked to my left to see her laying on her side smiling at me as always. For having pulled an all-nighter she looked very well put together. I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised, but I was. She trailed her finger along my chest and flashed me that doting look she had adopted so well after we had sex. She handed me my glasses and I wrestled myself to sit up and survey the battleground. The room was a mess, though not because of our activities. Rather I was surprised at how little- er bodily fluids were on the furniture or floor. I guess if nothing else, Succubi prefer clean surroundings. Still the deck of cards we had used in strip poker lay strewn across the floor along with empty bags of food and crushed soda cans. It looked like a frat party for non-drinkers. In one bed lay myself and Lara while the one opposite had Aubrey and Charity with the latter nestling with the former. There was something hot about that, the two sexiest girls in the room snuggling like lesbian lovers. Su was slumped on a set of chairs, four lined up to make a sort of bench. Seeing it reminded me of how the four girls all lined up with their asses up making me go down the line and fill their awaiting pussies. I had to admit, it was fun watching them wiggle, twerk, and shake their asses while I fucked the ones next to them. Sophia was an expert twerker surprisingly. Speaking of Sophia, she was the last laying on the floor in a heep of blankets where she likely passed out after I ate her out like an all-you-can-eat buffet. I honestly lost count of how many orgasms I put her through. <br />
<br />
I smiled as fragments of memories locked into place, realizing that I was literally a god the night before. Still, as much sex as I had last night I didn&#39;t feel content or fulfilled. Instead I felt pent up, as though I hadn&#39;t fucked anyone as long as I had lived. Not only that but my balls ached as though they were full beyond capacity. &quot;What&#39;s the damage?&quot; I asked, trying to avoid throwing Lara down and fucking her hard. I didn&#39;t want to wake the Venus Club up and resume the previous night&#39;s activities. Something told me I wouldn&#39;t get any satisfaction from that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Total annihilation,&quot; she giggled, leaning against my back and throwing her arms around me. &quot;You fucked them till they passed out. Even now I don&#39;t think they could handle anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many times did I-?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s see you came in Su four times: once in her mouth, and three times in her pussy. You came in Sophia six times: once in her mouth, twice in her pussy and three times in her ass, and then we have a tie between Aubrey and Charity whom you came in eight times each with the girls tag teaming you towards the end like champs. So you came a grand total of-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty-six times...&quot; I muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Lara whispered giving me a peck on the cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then why do I want to rape your right now?&quot; I asked, my erection already set to maximum. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because I reversed the flow,&quot; she grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked, confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me and I&#39;ll explain,&quot; she smiled, handing me my clothes which were folded and waiting. I complied, barely able to fit my pants on right. I must have been doing a bit of growing during my short nap because my boys felt cramped in the crotch of my jeans. We snuck out of the girl&#39;s room and headed down the hall to hers, Lara&#39;s dorm the epitome of girly and yet organized and immaculate. &quot;Make yourself comfortable,&quot; she laughed as I pulled down my pants and examined my manhood. Sure enough I was bigger than before, or at least slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Explain what you said,&quot; I growled, feeling in a rotten mood for some reason. Perhaps it was sexual frustration? I shook my head at the notion. One does not cum 26 times in an evening and feel sexually frustrated. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, it&#39;s pretty simple. When a man and woman have sex, there is usually an exchange. Women exchange fluids with the men and vice versa. It&#39;s through these fluids that sexual energy is exchanged. Now usually, men actually give more to women than the other way around. This is why men are usually exhausted after sex and fall asleep. However, you giving and giving and giving to other women does not aid your purpose at all. So what I did was to reverse the flow of masculine sexual energy. You used to be similar to a transmitter, but not, you&#39;re more like an antenna. You no longer send out energy, you simply collect it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that possible when I came so many times? If the energy exchanges through ejaculation how do I have more energy than before?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Because I ceased the exchange. From now on you will cum, but the energy within it is greatly reduced. That is why no girl you fuck from now on will become pregnant. You will cum as a form of release and to increase the sexual pleasure of you and your partner, but your energy output will be minimal. Instead, every woman you fuck, you&#39;ll drain. They will become exhausted while you have the energy to keep going. They will cum quickly while you will take some time. They will lose their stamina and you will gain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make me sound like a parasite,&quot; I muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you are in some way. But then if that&#39;s the case, so am I,&quot; Lara giggled, moving over to where I sat and kneeling down to stare at my hard on. &quot;You drain the energy of your sexual partners, and store it for me to take. And oh... how you are just bristling with energy,&quot; she cooed, touching my tender flesh, my dick twitching with her caress. I wanted her, every fiber in my being wanted her. I needed to fill her with my essence, make her mine, I needed release. She smiled, kissing my member and rubbing her finger sensually around my head. &quot;So tell me, Jethro, how does it feel to have the energy and libido of five women all cram packed inside you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel stuffed,&quot; I grimaced trying to disguise any sign of pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like me to take it all at once, or in servings?&quot; she cooed, looking at me lustily.</p>
