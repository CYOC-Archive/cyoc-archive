<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Shuixing wanted to the Lunar New Year festivities with her sisters, first, she had some business to attend to. Her time at the Bowman dairy farm was really nice for her and she liked Nate&#39;s family. But she did notice how her presence did cause a little tension there. Specifically, Nate&#39;s father didn&#39;t have very many people to pass the farm to after he retired and Shuixing and Nate became mates, it wouldn&#39;t be likely for her to move to the farm.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Bowman had an idea for the future. There were four cows at the farm that were too old for giving milk now. Instead of putting those cows out to pasture, they could be uplifted, making them productive milkers again and farmhands as well. Shuixing wasn&#39;t sure if those cows would want to work on the farm after their uplifting, but they looked so sweet and she wanted to see them uplifted as well. It took a while to drive those cattle all the way from Wisconsin to Nevada, but now they were at Horizon Labs and Shuixing was waiting for the other cow that will help with the double-dosing.<br />
<br />
Soon, she heard the sound of running hoofsteps. She looked out to see a cow Animalian running over. Her golden hair showed that she was converted instead of uplifted. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late,&quot; she panted as she got over to the door, &quot;There needs to be a bus stop here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You took the bus?&quot; asked Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s still a college week and it would be more efficient to commute on the bus. If I knew I was going to be called here, I&#39;d have taken my car,&quot; said the cow woman, &quot;I&#39;m Maddie, by the way. Hey, aren&#39;t you one of the Five Elements?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shuixing,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;You must be from the special sorority.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pi Eta Tau,&quot; said Maddie, &quot;A lot of us are in town for the fest. It&#39;s kinda early for spring break so we&#39;re not really getting whole days off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you come?&quot; asked Shuixing. She had wanted to give the dairy cows a gentle uplifting, a double-dosing from the milk of two different cow Animalians. She was the first, but she didn&#39;t know what to expect with the latter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess a lot of the other cows are busy right now,&quot; said Maddie, &quot;I have some free time so I offered. A lot of my friends are uplifted cows. Even my mate was just a bull before he was uplifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;I don&#39;t have a mate, yet.&quot; She really liked Nate, but she agreed with his father to wait a year and see if they would really be long term.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope these new cows won&#39;t give you competition,&quot; said Maddie jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope not either,&quot; said Shuixing. She hadn&#39;t considered that possibility, but she wasn&#39;t worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take care of those cows,&quot; said Maddie, &quot;We don&#39;t want to miss out on the fest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point,&quot; said Shuixing as they headed inside.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Maddie and Shuixing had long since gotten used to the feeling of milk pumps on their nipples. Maddie did have more experience since she sold her pasteurized milk when she first came to Animalia. Even so, even she was unable to keep herself from letting off aroused moos like Shuixing.<br />
<br />
When they got their needed amount, Shuixing removed her milk pumps and covered her breasts with one arm. &quot;Are they always this sensitive or are we extra-sensitive?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Maddie removed her milk pumps, not being as shy with her nipples showing. Working as a stripper at the Meat Market removed a lot of her modesty. &quot;I can&#39;t really say from personal experience,&quot; said Maddie, &quot;From what I hear, Animalians to have more sensitive nipples than humans and I think naturally milk-producing Animalians more than others. But I don&#39;t really know for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of their milk was mixed into a mash for the cows. They watched from an observation window as the four cows approached the trough. After sniffing it, they started eating the mash. They didn&#39;t finish it before the changes started. The cows gave moos of discomfort as their bones start reshaping, reforming their heavyset bodies into bipedal forms. Shuixing watched with interest as one fell back onto her haunches. Her hindquarters were already re-configuring into a humanoid lower half, her hips widening out as her ass grew out. Shuixing watched as her udder deflated completely, shrinking down until there were only four vestigial teats left. Shuixing wasn&#39;t sure why cow Animalians and other such Animalians didn&#39;t have udders, but then an udder would get in the way a lot. Not long after that, a new pair of breasts were growing out of the cow&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
For Maddie, the changes weren&#39;t very surprising. She had seen plenty of naked or nearly-naked cows by now. It was a bit of a change to see a cow turn Animalian than a human. Their front hooves cracked apart as new hands formed. Their front legs became muscular arms as their shoulders shifted and became wider to better support them. As the cows&#39; muzzles grew shorter, their eyes became more intelligent and less confused. The moos they were making were becoming moans as their new breasts start dribbling milk.<br />
<br />
Maddie did notice a distinct difference between herself and these newly-uplifted cows. Maddie was a Belgian Blue, built more for beef than dairy, unlike the Swiss Browns there. The results could be seen in their anthropomorphic bodies. Maddie was very muscular underneath her feminine build. The Swiss Browns were fit, but daintier in build. Their breasts were also noticeably bigger than Maddie&#39;s. They weren&#39;t record-breakers, but definitely larger than average even among Animalians.<br />
<br />
Once the cows were all standing and looking at themselves, Shuixing and Maddie walked in. &quot;Girls, I assume you have a few questions,&quot; said Shuixing.<br />
<br />
One of the cows looked at Shuixing and asked, &quot;Do I know you?&quot; Her eartag told Shuixing that she was Blueberry, the oldest of the cows. Though that was relative since the double-dose had restored them all to their primes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Shuixing,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;We met on the farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The farm? Why aren&#39;t we there now?&quot; asked Blueberry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re in Animalia, a community of uplifted animals,&quot; said Maddie, &quot;You were brought here so you can become young, healthy, and intelligent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do feel smarter,&quot; said Blueberry, &quot;But I&#39;m still confused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be able to bring you up to speed,&quot; said Maddie, &quot;We&#39;ll probably have you educated enough by Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;</p>
