<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Self-indulgence, thy name is RainingJustice.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Was somebody ever going to tell me that Martians are a thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, Hannah Bishop had come to accept that she couldn&#39;t catch a break. That was just the fundamental reality of her presidency, ever since her fateful decision a year prior to lift the veil of the supernatural. Since that time, every moment spent enjoying the world&#39;s newfound acceptance of her sexuality, every crisis eased by the ability to drop a bunch of witches on it, every little second in which her approval rating briefly ticked up, was counterbalanced by the world trying to end, or some transformative pandemic or another, or an alien invasion like this one - which was now subject to its own alien invasion. Christ, this job just got steadily more weird every week.<br />
<br />
There was a tired look on her face as she glanced over to a collection of flag officers. One of them, a general in an Air Force uniform, was even brave enough to offer up a reply. &quot;Madam President, I have to say... this is as much a surprise to you as it is to all of us.&quot; Murmurs of agreement spread throughout the Oval Office, but Bishop just kept on staring at the general.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martians exist, and we didn&#39;t know about it?&quot; The lean brunette wasn&#39;t sure whether to laugh or cry. &quot;We&#39;ve got a wormhole machine under Cheyenne, we have cordial relations with reptile battlemages from Proxima Centauri, there&#39;s a squadron of women who are living starships, we made our own latex supersoldiers with a bunch of reverse-engineered futa corpses - and you&#39;re telling me we didn&#39;t know about the martians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ma&#39;am, we never really thought to go over there and check.&quot; The silver-haired man shrugged slightly, seemingly unfazed by everything going on. &quot;Seemed a bit cliche, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...perhaps.&quot; Bishop sighed. It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t appreciate this little development. Sure, SALEM and Hetzer&#39;s plane-girls had been getting ready to launch a counteroffensive, but between some resistance to magic among those hybrids and Johnson still unsure if her Rubber Corp was going to be subject to mind control by the progentitors of their latex tools... things had been looking dicey. The images currently playing out in her office, satellite recon showing a martian fleet smashing through the futa lines, ought to have been a welcome relief.<br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t be put at ease. This was too convienent. No way in hell these Red Planet assholes were intervening out of the kindness of their hearts. No, they expected to gain something here. And with so many unknowns to deal with... maybe it was time to put something into action. A little contingency they&#39;d been arranging for a while. Her steely gaze turned over towards a holographic projection of another officer, currently busy elsewhere and not able to meet in person. &quot;Regan, how long would it take you to get Valkyrie into gear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least a few days, ma&#39;am... maybe more. We&#39;d need to round everyone up, get them up to speed, make sure they can operate together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm. Better get to it, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real.&quot; Staring into the holographic display of the battle being transmitted by their probe, Admiral Shani felt so very odd. Like she was watching something unreal, something fake, something deeply and truly wrong simply for how it defied her understanding of the universe. Yet here it was, playing out in real time. &quot;We&#39;re certain this is legitimate? Not some trick by the futas, bait to lure us into a trap?&quot;<br />
<br />
An equine man with several cybernetics nodded to the catwoman. &quot;We&#39;ve checked a dozen times, Admiral, made sure the transmission is secure, done every possible scan to verify that it isn&#39;t an illusion of some kind. This is absolutely real.&quot;<br />
<br />
So many centuries this vagabond fleet had wandered the cosmos, hoping to find an ally that could repel the futas. So many years her own people had been bereft of hope, expecting never to see their ancient homeworld freed from the latex menace. And yet now she watched as a fleet of warships smashed their way through the lines of the futas, one shiny oval after another being torn to bits by lances of green energy. The futas had already sent two more fleets as reinforcement, and yet they seemed to fare little better, the battle favoring their opponents.<br />
<br />
Shani&#39;s heart raced. This was it. This was the answer to their prayers. For the refugees of so many assimilated worlds, the millions of lost souls crammed into a collection of vessels that blindly wandered the cosmos, this was a sign that the gods might yet show them favor. What she had thought would be another doomed world, good only as a place to gather up a handful of refugees before their entire species was wiped out, had instead handed them salvation.<br />
<br />
By the Grace of the Thousand Angels, she would not let this opportunity pass them by. &quot;Bring the fleet to full battle alert, and prepare to jump. We join these Martians with haste!&quot; This was it. This was the day when their eternal war changed. This was the turning point, the moment history would make as the beginning of their march to victory. The greatest glory any Matulian had ever earned was ripe for the taking - Shani&#39;s head swam just imagining it.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;Pull back to low orbit and tighten up our formation!&quot; Stickeila-3375 was fidgeting with worry as she watched the battle unfold around them. The creatures from this system&#39;s fourth world not being discovered prior to invasion had been a failure of their intelligence operatives - but this catastrophic assault was solely her responsibility. They had struck upon her fleet&#39;s rear with vicious swiftness, their bizarre green heat lances ripping through the latex hulls of the Futa warships. So many of her sisters were being torn apart, melted to slag by the enemy, and their own weapons seemed to be of middling effectiveness.<br />
<br />
The situation was increasingly dire, even as hyperspace was torn asunder for several more Futa fleets to emerge. The Martians were a relentless and intolerable people, this much she had already gathered. The reports from the hive mind already showed that assimilation was proving nigh-impossible - not only were their vessels powerful enough to challenge the fleet in open combat, but in the boarding party fights her people naturally attempted during any engagement, the greatest weapon in the Futa arsenal was proving to be worthless.<br />
<br />
Why had they set upon her people like this? Why did every sapient race always need to resist so violently? Her people brought eternal life, health, happiness, pure bliss - and yet the savage races of the galaxy insisted on violent and primitive rebellion, on death and annihilation over peaceful coexistence. Stickeila&#39;s heart ached for the sisters being murdered simply for the crime of wanting to make another species happy; she wanted to cry, to bawl her eyes out. But the sorrow in her voluptuous chest instead fueled a righteous fury. <br />
<br />
They would pay for this. These monsters, these <i>insects</i>, they would suffer divine retribution for their insolence. Even with the staggering losses thus far, she finally felt a surge of hope as a glorious presence filled their collective minds. The Mother Queen herself had arrived - with her leading the charge, even this horrific new enemy would surely be crushed. She barked out orders, sending what was left of her fleet charging in alongside the Queen&#39;s enormous flagship, intent on helping their majesty deal the crushing blow.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kinda cool, honestly,&quot; Teresa mused as she watched the whole thing playing out on a set of TV screens. Her hand toyed with Yvonne&#39;s soft blonde hair playfully, nude bodies rubbing up against each other as the scientist lazily kissed at her neck. &quot;Sorta like... a big old prize fight back home, but the fighters are all alien bastards.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde paused her sea of kisses to nod in agreement. &quot;Mmmm. Something like that.&quot; She quickly returned to her affections for the private&#39;s body, silently thankful that there were a dozen other super-science outfits tasked with the truly stressful work right now - more time to spend adoring her absolute favorite young guard. And soon, hopefully, once she&#39;d completed the inhibitor chip to block victims from being inducted to the hive mind... the private&#39;s new body would be making her a <i>very</i> happy woman.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;Shay begorrah,&quot; Niamh whispered under her breath. She spent another moment staring into the magical displays of the fighting outside the city, before turning around to yell into the back. &quot;Terriiiiii!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah hun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do ye feel about dicks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re asking if you can get one, the answer is yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Irish girl&#39;s heart pounded with excitement as she rushed to grab the right potion. She wasn&#39;t into latex, but... this invasion was giving her <i>ideas...</i><br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Cassandra said flatly as she watched the latex oval pass by overhead, not even noticing the island thanks to the magic around it. &quot;Nope. Not getting involved.&quot; The kraken-woman had been enough for her.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Rhonda shrugged. &quot;I mean, I&#39;d be into it if not for the penises.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of Sofia&#39;s eyebrows quirked as she looked away from the TV broadcast to her draconic friend. &quot;What is it with you and dicks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Local lesbian doesn&#39;t like cocks, more at eleven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s transphobic. Women can totally have cocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhonda sighed. &quot;Point taken. So... we gonna do something about this, or?&quot;<br />
<br />
The german girl shook her head as the TV showed Superbimbo and Timeslut facing off against a horde of the Latex Futas in San Diego. &quot;Nahhh. SALEM, or the guys in Cheyenne Mountain, or the Valkarians, or somebody else is just gonna end up kicking their ass, and you and I have homework to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but what if they don&#39;t, though?&quot; She briefly looked down to fire off a text back to Emma, giving her some words of encouragement for her current effort with Millie to escape their hometown. &quot;This is... normally we get involved in this sorta thing, because everyone else ends up failing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a pretty good feeling they&#39;ll get it under control this time. Just relax, let somebody else save the planet for once.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wanted to protest, but after a moment, Rhonda shrugged. &quot;Guess we can&#39;t go be at the center of everything. That&#39;d probably get repetitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. People would get bored if it was all Rhonda and Sofia, all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a pinch of us, every now and then, that&#39;s the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiny pinch.&quot; The slimy dragon-girl snorted. &quot;Can you imagine how bad it&#39;d be, though, if there wasn&#39;t all sorts of weird shit to go deal with those things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, world would be fucked. Glad that didn&#39;t happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Clacking at a keyboard in the American heartland, a young woman briefly wondered if she was getting too meta - and then decided, fuck it, she wasn&#39;t getting meta enough with this.</p>
