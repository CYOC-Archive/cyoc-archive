<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wyatt and Kyra both took several breaths as they looked at one another before nodding and headed toward Ken and Duncan again using their weapons against them. Wyatt was using an arming sword while Kyra felt more comfortable using a katana. Both of them had been training alongside Ken and Duncan for weeks and the two more skilled vampires were impressed with how fast they both learned. To Ken and Duncan&#39;s surprise, the two of them managed to disarm them with combined fighting styles as they both held their weapons at crucial points that would have killed them both if they weren&#39;t on the same side.<br />
<br />
The sound clapping could be heard not far away from them as they looked over to see Lord Miro alongside Stella and Eloise in evening attire for the night while Little Ann walked alongside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very impressive you two, your training has come along much better than I&#39;d anticipated. I can&#39;t wait to see you both in action.&quot; Miro complimented his adoptive son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you father, but you won&#39;t exactly see us in person out there. Kyra and I will wear disguises to hide our anonymity.&quot; Wyatt informed his adoptive father.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is something like soft armor suits that cover our body and maybe motorcycle helmets so no one will see our faces.&quot; Kyra added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it may be best you do that seeing as how these young wizards attend the same school as you do. Now, Wyatt, I&#39;m headed out with Stella and Eloise for dinner and a show. But I need you two to do something tonight: the police need to be...on our payroll, so to speak. I need you two to make the police will be on the look out for dangerous young teens of the magic kind. Now the other business is you must let Ann have a little fun tonight. It&#39;s been quite a while, and she&#39;s craving something to do. I trust you&#39;ll make the right decisions tonight, my son.&quot; Lord Miro said as he left with Stella and Eloise at his sides.<br />
<br />
Wyatt and Kyra both looked at little Ann knowing she didn&#39;t have the highest opinion of them.<br />
<br />
********************************************<br />
<br />
A little later, Wyatt and Kyra were in their gear that no one would recognize them in. Little Ann rolled her eyes at them and shook her head as she looked up and down the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....Ann....are you able to...talk?&quot; Kyra asked.<br />
<br />
Little Ann stomped her foot once for &#39;yes&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well why don&#39;t you?&quot; Kyra asked again.<br />
<br />
This time little Ann flipped her off putting an end to that question.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, I see one.&quot; Wyatt said pointing to a street where they saw a police car driving along.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s an alley not too far away from here, no one&#39;s around there so we&#39;ll be safe from prying eyes.&quot; Kyra informed them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Ann, I know you probably hate to do this, but could you pretend to get hit by a car?&quot; Wyatt asked as Ann rolled her eyes and they headed to the alley to catch up with the police car.<br />
<br />
*********************************************************<br />
<br />
It had been a late night and Officer Jenkins was trying her hardest to say awake while her partner Officer Cooper was used to these late nights. They had caught a child molester they&#39;d been searching a few days for and were taking him to the station.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I barely did anything wrong.&quot; The man said from the back of the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell you did, you piece of....whoa!&quot; Jenkins said as Cooper slammed on the breaks. Officer Cooper had just managed to hit the car&#39;s breaks before he unwittingly hit what looked like a little girl before she ran off to an alleyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see that? It looked like a little girl, we&#39;ve got to see if she&#39;s safe.&quot; Officer Jenkins said as she got out of the car and ran down the alleyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenkins, wait! We&#39;ll just call it in, Jenkins!&quot; Officer Cooper said trying to call back his partner. Jenkins shook his head and looked back at the man in the backseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You stay right where you are, asshole.&quot; Officer Cooper said as he went to catch up with his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there, are you hurt?&quot; Officer Jenkins said to the little girl as she began sniffling trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenkins damn it, she&#39;s just a lost kid. Well radio it in and be off.&quot; Officer Cooper said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s hurt Cooper, she needs some help.&quot; Officer Jenkins argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she has it.&quot; A male voice said from behind.<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins and Officer Cooper turned around to see two young teens walking toward them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you two with this girl?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might say that.&quot; The teen girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just needed you both away from the car for a moment.&quot; The teen boy said.<br />
<br />
Wyatt and Kyra&#39;s eyes both glowed as Officer Jenkins and Officer Cooper both froze.<br />
<br />
&quot;There have been reports of suspicious activity all over town, this has been related to our business expanding.&quot; Wyatt explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Business?&quot; Officer Cooper asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampire business. Now before you freak out, I want you to listen, vampires are becoming a minority in the world. What we want is to just live beside you all in the world just like everyone else. But there are people out there who you need to watch out for, besides those such as child molesters.&quot; Kyra further explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look like ordinary teens, but they have magical properties and think highly of themselves. They prefer to help their own rather than those who need it. You could say that they&#39;re like the one percent. If anyone asks about vampire related activity or has any leads about it, we want you to look the other way. Remember, we&#39;re trying to help better your world, not destroy it.&quot; Wyatt explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Officer Cooper asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampires have an unlimited resource into acquiring that which you&#39;ve always desired. The money to help your family, the clothes you desire, or even just helping you out for the little things. We&#39;re there to help you, but it&#39;s the other people who don&#39;t have that desire. Now, may we help you with your problem?&quot; Kyra explained then asked as she looked the police car.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want him?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
Wyatt and Kyra nodded as they let the officers free.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about...?&quot; Officer Jenkins turned around to see Ann fiddling with a switchblade knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll bring him over.&quot; Officer Cooper said as he brought over their prisoner.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this? You arrest me and then bring me right in front of a child?&quot; The prisoner said as he suddenly screamed in pain as Ann had punctured the man&#39;s knee and he fell to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot; Officer Jenkins said as Officer Cooper held back from throwing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, this man is a criminal, we&#39;ll deal with him. Remember what we&#39;ve told you and spread the word: Lord Miro Tepes is an outstanding citizen as are his vampire followers. Long live lord Miro.&quot; Wyatt said as his and Kyra&#39;s eyes flashed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long live Lord Miro.&quot; The two officers said as they left the alley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long live my father.&quot; Wyatt smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And long live his prince, my love.&quot; Kyra said kissing him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Wyatt and Kyra then turned back to the man as he groaned in agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You two gotta help me, this little bitch is nuts!&quot; The prisoner said as Kyra gave him a kick to the chin and he fell on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, she just wants you to suffer until the end. Think of this as poetic justice.&quot; Wyatt said as the prisoner begged for mercy as little Ann tearing his body apart and chewing on the softer parts as the man slowly died.<br />
<br />
After a while, there was nothing that remained of the prisoner.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Ann, do you think we did good tonight?&quot; Kyra asked.<br />
<br />
Little Ann wiped her mouth of the fresh blood and stomped her foot once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, do you think I&#39;m worthy to be lord Miro&#39;s successor?&quot; Wyatt asked as Ann walked closer up to him and bowed to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess that answers that.&quot; Kyra said as the three of them took to the roofs and headed back to headquarters. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Long live Lord Miro.&quot;</p>
