<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen uses this time to &#39;feel&#39; herself, touching her babyish vulva. She felt a little tickling and noticed how sensitive her new crotch was. &#39;I need to remember to turn my self into a teenage girl, on Monday...&#39; Jen thought. <br />
Her mom picked her up and lowered her into her bubble bath. It was comfortable warm and Jen felt the water surrounding her. She also felt it down at her private parts. In this sitting position, the water was about belly to chest deep. Jen noticed how small the was, she couldn&#39;t even look over the edge of the tub. Her mother bent down to her and started washing her. <br />
When she was clean, her mother picked her up, lifted her out of the tub and placed her on the floor on a towel. Then she immediately put another towel around her and started rubbing her dry. Being dried by large hands and a towel that could cover her entirely felt so good. <br />
<br />
When she was finished, Jen was carried to her room, where the changing table was, and was going to get a fresh diaper for the night. As her mother laid her down and went to the drawer to grab a diaper and wipes, Jen had time to turn her head around and look at the clock. It took her a few seconds to figure the time out. It was 7 o&#39;clock. Jen also saw that her mother was having trouble finding the wipes, so she thought she could get another impression of her vulva. She tried to sat up but her muscles were not strong enough to perform this action. No matter how hard she tried, she stayed lying. Then her mother approached her laughing. &quot;Did you try to sat up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeth.&quot; After a short break she added &quot;do wek&quot; (too weak). <br />
&quot;You have to get used to this now&quot; her mother said, &quot;babies don&#39;t have strong muscles.&quot;<br />
It was kind of embarrassing that she didn&#39;t think of that at first and her mother even explained it to her like she didn&#39;t understand that. <br />
<br />
After changing her, Jen&#39;s mother carried her to the living room again, where the building blocks were still in place. Her mom sat down to the couch and placed down Jen next to her. She could see her reflection in the turned off TV screen. She was wearing the same white diaper as before and a pink baby shirt with some letters on it. She couldn&#39;t read what they said though. Everything was harder for her now and reading mirrored text seemed to surpass her abilities. <br />
&quot;We&#39;re gonna watch a little TV now and then you&#39;re going to go to sleep, you&#39;ll need it&quot;. <br />
&quot;Oda&quot; (okay), she answered. <br />
Then the blocks attracted her attention. &#39;It was kinda nice to play with them&#39;, Jen thought. Also it had been quite challenging due to her limited dexterity. <br />
<br />
While her mother turned the TV, Jen got onto her knees as started crawling towards the edge of the sofa. After arriving, she looked down. It was very high from her perspective although it was only about a few inches more than a foot deep (40 cm). &#39;Maybe I should turn around and lower myself down slowly&#39;, she thought. Jen turned around and crawled backwards until she hit the edge. <br />
Her mother got up quickly as she saw what Jen was going to do. <br />
&quot;Stop! Be careful, let me help you!&quot; she told Jen while grabbing her sides for support. <br />
&quot;Do ma de!&quot; (do myself) Jen wanted to do it herself. It wasn&#39;t even two feet. That should really be doable. <br />
As the lowered her body down very slowly, Jen lost the grip and slid down a little. Her mother grabbed her and put her down on the floor. Now Jen was glad that her mother wanted to help her, but also very embarrassed that she didn&#39;t manage to do it without help. She noticed how dependent she was as a little baby, her body was only 18 months old after all. <br />
&quot;Thand doo&quot; (thank you). <br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome. But don&#39;t do that again, when I&#39;m not there, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the doorbell rang. <br />
&quot;Who can that be now?&quot; her mother asked. She muted the TV. Then she stood up and walked towards the door. <br />
&quot;Stay here and don&#39;t do anything dangerous&quot; she warned.<br />
Jen&#39;s dad and her mothers husband was working late and it was only a few minutes after seven, so he couldn&#39;t be it. Also he would&#39;ve used his key. And formerly Jeff&#39;s younger sister Megan and now Jen&#39;s older sister was spending the weekend with her friend, so she couldn&#39;t be it either. That was when Jen heard the voice of his ten year old sister. She had always been a little small with her now 4&#39;6&quot; (1,35m). Back when Jeff was 16, he had been almost two heads taller than her. <br />
Jen wondered what Megan was doing here and why her mother and her kept talking so long. Then she heard a few snippets of the conversation.<br />
&quot;I forgot&quot;, &quot;sleeping&quot;. That was her sister. She must&#39;ve forgotten her stuff for overnight.<br />
Then her mother said something with &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;surprised&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then they both came into the living room and walked towards him. <br />
&quot;Oh my good, is that him?&quot; Megan asked in disbelief. &quot;No way, he is soooo cute.&quot;<br />
They came closer and Jen, still standing, was thunderstruck. He wasn&#39;t prepared for that.<br />
Their mother sat onto the sofa again while Megan went directly next to him and then touched his head. <br />
Jen reached to about her belly button. Then he looked up. She was so huge now. She seemed to be almost two times as tall as him. And she was only ten and small as well. Jen had been the one, who was a lot taller than her, he had teased her a lot for this. And now she was in his position. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look how tiny he is&quot; she smiled and got down in a crouch, to be on eye level with him. <br />
&quot;When I&#39;m standing, he only reaches to my belly button&quot; she gloated. <br />
Jen blushed. This was so humiliating. Her former smaller sister was now a lot taller than her. <br />
Their mother laughed. &quot;Jen doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy your appearance&quot; she told Megan. <br />
&quot;yeth&quot; she confirmed shyly.<br />
&quot;Oh that lisp is so adorable.&quot;<br />
Jen blushed once again. It was so embarrassing to be called cute and adorable.<br />
&#39;I&#39;m still a 16 year old boy in my mind&#39;, she thought. <br />
&quot;Thob dad!&quot; (stop that!) she told Megan. <br />
&quot;Why? It&#39;s not my fault that you are a little baby.&quot;<br />
After a short break she continued &quot;and you seem to be a girl as well.&quot;<br />
She reached her hand out and grabbed Jen&#39;s diaper between her legs. Before Jen could react, Megan pushed a little.<br />
&quot;Mom was right, you are a girl&quot; she remarked.<br />
Jen felt a tickling and out of her mouth came a short squeaky sound. <br />
&quot;Let her go.&quot; Finally their mother intervened. <br />
Megan pulled her hand back stood up from her crouching position while Jen was still standing. She felt tiny again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have another idea&quot; Megan said. She sat down on the sofa, right where Jen was standing and put her hands around her smaller sisters waist. Jen was too confused to react and found herself in midair a second later. <br />
&#39;My ten year old sister can lift me up like I&#39;m nothing!&#39; she thought shocked. She was so much stronger than her now, she could do anything with her. <br />
Then Megan pulled Jen closer to herself and sat her onto her lap. <br />
&#39;I&#39;m sitting on my smaller sister&#39;s lap&#39;,  she thought. &#39;How embarrassing!&#39;<br />
But it felt so large, Jen was sitting very comfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he will only stay like this for the weekend?&quot; Megan asked her mother. <br />
&quot;Yes honey, only for the weekend&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll have to go back to Sarah&#39;s after packing my overnight stuff but I&#39;ll come back tomorrow before noon already to have a little fun with &#39;Jen&#39;.&quot; She payed extra attention to emphasize her sister&#39;s name.<br />
She then hugged her from behind, bent forward to look at her and said &quot;Alright?&quot; in a way somebody would talk to a baby. <br />
&quot;Nod aweid!&quot; (not alright!) Jen protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now hurry&quot;, their mother intervened again, &quot;Sarah is expecting you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&quot;<br />
Megan grabbed Jen under her arms and lifted her up from her lap onto the floor and sat her down next to the building blocks. <br />
&quot;Have fun with your baby toys&quot; she said while twinkling to Jen. <br />
Jen didn&#39;t want to take that, so she grabbed one block and threw it away, but it didn&#39;t land far away from her.<br />
&quot;Oh adorable.&quot; With those words Megan left the room to pack her stuff.<br />
<br />
Then</p>
