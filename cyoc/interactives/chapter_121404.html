<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Normally, Sundays were for relaxation and normally Sundays that came after Halloween, especially so. But despite everything that had related to Halloween there were other issues that had come up that, there were still things going on that posed potential problems for Moon Lake that brought Moon Lake&#39;s Mayor, Martin Stovall, Moon Lake&#39;s Deputy Mayor, Katherine Chambers, Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor, Samantha Twist, Moon Lake&#39;s Chief of Police, Chief O&#39;Hara, and the Skulk&#39;s leader Akane no Tachibana. Technically speaking, as a member of the city council, Akane didn&#39;t necessarily need to be there, as the town&#39;s &quot;executive&quot; decision would be presented to the city council at the next meeting, however the actions that had called for this meeting were such that she felt it best to attend. And the situation was one that would be necessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this true? Is this Dymixious character ACTUALLY in Moon Lake?&quot; Katherine Chambers asked as she sat down at the conference table, &quot;and that Moon Lake is ACTIVELY giving him aid and comfort?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is here, but &quot;aid and comfort&quot; isn&#39;t really an issue,&quot; O&#39;Hara spoke, &quot;we have had him under surveillance and if it weren&#39;t for the fact that we had to commit so much to the Jenkins/Harper wedding, yesterday, we probably would have put him under arrest. Even if the man is personally wishing to protect the secret of weres&#39; existence... going around being a vigilante about it ISN&#39;T the way to do it. Technology is getting too good to be able pull that sort off without ultimately attracting attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine Chambers gave a slowly gulp and then sighed heavily. While she was a normal, she had grown up in Moon Lake and had been highly civic minded. Thus, she&#39;d come back and continued to stay and serve her home town the best she could. In this, she was well aware of how weres tended to look to their own safety, and often she did agree with them on those issues. However, she couldn&#39;t condone using the &quot;were secret&quot; as justification to hide someone wanted by the FBI and the Seattle PD for murder. If THAT got out, even if the &quot;were secret&quot; was protected, it would destroy the political careers of everyone in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the end consequences from the wedding won&#39;t be clear for a few days,&quot; Samantha spoke up, &quot;I believe we&#39;re past the worst in that department... but there is still going to be time that will need to pass before that book can be officially closed.&quot;<br />
<br />
That did generate nods in response. Everyone in the room had either been involved in the Jenkins/Harper wedding or at least had been aware of it and the problems that went with it. That wouldn&#39;t go away and the present issue with Dymixious only compounded them, due to the fact that FBI was helping the Seattle PD track Dymixious and had found a phone number that had brought them to knowing who Dymixious had listed as a contact, Akane No Tachibana. It was that warning that ultimately precipitated the present meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real question is on what to do now,&quot; Martin spoke up before sipping his coffee, &quot;We can&#39;t change what&#39;s already happened, and looking over the past can only help for preventing further issues like this one from coming again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid there probably isn&#39;t too much that we can do legally,&quot; O&#39;Hara spoke, &quot;The police and FBI in Seattle already know that this Dymixious has Akane as a contact. And from what I&#39;ve been told on the nature of this contact is that his actions regarding that connection could be taken as a form of blackmail. Essentially, &quot;you agreed to help me, no question, so do what I say&quot; or &quot;I did this for you and you owe me, do what I say.&quot; That doesn&#39;t say much good about this Dymixious and should be plenty to provide Mrs. Tachibana defense against anything that Seattle or the FBI may wish to bring with regards to the contact that they&#39;ve found... However, the fact that they HAVE found a contact... that means that they will likely send someone to investigate matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if that was all that it was, it wouldn&#39;t be that much of an issue,&quot; Akane spoke softly, &quot;the deal made was with Dymixious&#39;s father... but when stories came back to Osamu and I... it was a deal that was rapidly regretted. Especially as both Dymixious and his father seemed to keep track on where I&#39;ve lived, almost as if for the purpose of calling in such favors. If things were left to show that what the man and his father have done is blackmail, as the chief puts it... that is one thing. But the fact that Dymixious requested safety, both for himself and his pregnant wife is quite another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pregnant...&quot; Katherine said slowly, her voice falling off at the end.<br />
<br />
Akane nodded, &quot;on certain levels, neither Dymixious nor his father are evil or even what we would classify as a rogue. In fact a lot of their agenda is aimed at removing those we classify as rogues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taking the law into your own hands is a crime, regardless of your intention,&quot; O&#39;Hara counted, &quot;by the law, that would be a rogue&#39;s actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin then sighed. This sort of thing was a difficult one to deal with, and he did remember meeting with the two Luna Brotherhood agents that had made the comment of being some secret society that went back to the American Revolution, but he wasn&#39;t very knowledgeable on many aspects of Moon Lake&#39;s history and origins beyond the basic version that everyone knew. The two agents, were heavily interested in dealing with Dymixious and seemed to set off some alarm bells in Martin&#39;s mind that they wouldn&#39;t be above killing Dymixious if it meant preserving the were secret, which would also have the potential for the meeting&#39;s goal to reach other problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any way we can handle this without a fight?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would all depend on Dymixious,&quot; O&#39;Hara spoke, &quot;from what the officers monitoring him have reported... is that he is irritable, arrogant in dealing with them... not something you&#39;d want to do if you&#39;re supposed to be &quot;laying low,&quot; and all of which would mean that if we do what we should do by law, that he would fight against it... which would put his wife at risk and risk the were secret being exposed, particularly if the FBI and Seattle PD send people here to investigate the connections with Mrs. Tachibana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we could have him arrested before the FBI show up?&quot; Katherine asked, &quot;if he fights, then we&#39;d be able to overpower him and put an end to the fight before they arrive. All we&#39;d need to do is hand him over to them. Any fight that then happens can be reported in a way that protects Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Possible... but that&#39;d also take us knowing WHEN they&#39;re going to send their investigators too Moon Lake,&quot; O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;If they&#39;ve already sent someone... it may be too late for that... and considering the mess that we&#39;ve had to go through with regard to Dieter Wilhelm, we already have one FBI agent in town already...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically two,&quot; Samantha spoke up, &quot;Theodore Green is here on vacation with his wife... As a weretiger, now, he might be willing to help on certain levels... but he did say that he was off duty and on vacation. As such...&quot;<br />
<br />
O&#39;Hara blinked remembering the agent who had come regarding the investigation into Lionel Ulysses. He remembered the man had been normal but had been in close proximity to a werecat and thus made the guess that the man was already aware of weres. The man had stated that he was married to a werecat, but the two hadn&#39;t been able to find anyone that would transform him safely so he could be with his wife. He guessed that if he&#39;d come to Moon Lake on vacation, it had been for that purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;d be outside his jurisdiction with regard to the FBI and being off duty in violation of the FBI&#39;s own rules and regulations,&quot; O&#39;Hara said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha said, &quot;He told me that if this Dymixious just so happens to run into him and causes trouble he could help... but he can&#39;t consciously help round him up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may still need to arrest him,&quot; Katherine brought the discussion back to why the meeting was called, &quot;if the FBI is investigating him, simply watching him won&#39;t do... Especially if we&#39;ve been watching him as long as has been suggested. The longer we wait, the MORE risks we take, both for the town and for this pregnant wife of his.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we do that?&quot; Martin asked. His eyes focused on O&#39;Hara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legally? Yes,&quot; O&#39;Hara nodded, &quot;He is wanted for the murder of Lionel Ulysses. That much is publically known. In that, we have the legal grounds to apprehend him. Just as if we were to discover anyone on the FBI&#39;s Most Wanted List living in Moon Lake. The issue is going to be whether or not the arrest can be made easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think, chief?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given the reports... I&#39;d expect a fight,&quot; O&#39;Hara sighed, &quot;as I said, for a man who&#39;s supposed to be lying low because &quot;the law&quot; is after him... he acts like a king. Or like he&#39;s supposed to be a king. Though, thankfully, he hasn&#39;t caused any trouble in Moon Lake so far...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if the FBI find him anyway, there would be a fight and they&#39;d have more questions,&quot; Katherine commented, &quot;which could well mean that Moon Lake&#39;s secret is exposed...&quot;<br />
<br />
That raised further sighs. Things weren&#39;t easy, and it was likely they wouldn&#39;t get any easier with regard to dealing with Dymixious. Martin knew he had to protect the city and if the FBI was already drawing in on Dymixious in some way, shape, or form, any idea of letting him go to get caught outside of Moon Lake wasn&#39;t going to work. In that Martin gave a heavy sigh and made his decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any issue with arresting him?&quot; Martin asked to O&#39;Hara.<br />
<br />
&quot;With Dymixious? No,&quot; O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;vigilantism IS a crime, regardless of your intentions. In that, he&#39;s just as bad as any rogue as he&#39;s going outside the law to do it. My only issue is with these two guys that have shown up claiming they have permission to assist in watching Dymixious...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gustavus Amehr and Quentin Fives?&quot; Martin asked and waited for O&#39;Hara to give a surprised nod, &quot;they claim to represent some secret society with a history that goes back as far as the American Revolution and the &quot;legal&quot; beginnings of Moon Lake... The Luna Brotherhood, they called it... but they seemed just as interested in Dymixious capture as you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vigilantism is vigilantism,&quot; O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;unless they have Federal Law enforcement authority, their presence has just as much possibility of being criminal as Dymixious&#39;s actions. And if they have that sort of authority, why haven&#39;t they flashed it? Or brought the FBI here already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded, &quot;I understand.... but so long as they don&#39;t interfere and comply with your control, let&#39;s not make this any bigger than it has to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
O&#39;Hara nodded. From there Martin then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, gather all your available officers,&quot; Martin spoke, &quot;if we can do this peacefully, great... but you have my permission to act.&quot;<br />
<br />
O&#39;Hara nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of Dymixious&#39;s wife?&quot; came Akane&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
All eyes then turned to the werefox. She had sat quietly through the conference and answered some questions when asked, but had done her best to not be the driving force of the meeting.  However, they had reached a point Akane felt the need to speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no personal love for Dymixious&#39;s actions and I would even agree that he has pushed things to the point where his intentions are causing more trouble than they solve,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;but at the same time... are we to punish his wife for his actions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t harm her,&quot; O&#39;Hara assured her, &quot;though... it&#39;d also mean that if she stays there... she&#39;d need to abide by Moon Lake&#39;s laws and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can also see about visiting with her... see if she has a job and/or the means to commute,&quot; Samantha offered, &quot;and if not... I&#39;m sure we can find... something that can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Akane nodded. The others began to get up to leave as the meeting broke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may be a little while before I can bring any updates on this confrontation,&quot; O&#39;Hara spoke to Martin and then glanced to Samantha, &quot;and I&#39;ll have an officer come by when it&#39;s safe for you... and possibly Frances to speak with Dymixious&#39;s wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded. Things were continuing to hit hard and fast. A part of her wanted to check on Jen, as Claire Luv was not on the Halloween Party agenda that Frances and her had for Jen, but the warning call that she&#39;d gotten during the dance was enough to remind her of issues where the wider world at times seemed to encroach on Moon Lake. In that, the hits kept on coming. In that, Samantha did hope that her old college friend was okay and that things would soon quiet down.</p>
