<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd couldn’t help but become aroused at her perfect legs, and he couldn’t help but wonder what the rest of her body looked like. Staring at the cute girl looking back at him, he saw that she was breathing slowly, chest rising up and down in steady movements. He knew that she was starting to think similar thoughts as he was. Todd leaned in closely to Liz’s ear and whispered as he stoked her arm softly.<br />
<br />
“I really like you Liz.”<br />
<br />
Todd could see the shiver of delight that shot through Liz. Her face became flush and her eyes couldn’t seem to stay focused on his for long.<br />
 <br />
“I- I like you too Todd.”<br />
<br />
Todd remained leaned over Liz as he continued to stoke her arm. Up and down, slowly and methodically, he softly scratched her arm with his nails. Liz started to sink deeper into the couch, all tension seeming to disappear from her. Todd had another idea, one that would hopefully address the arousal that was still building inside him. <br />
<br />
“How about you turn around Liz? Flip positions so your head is on my lap. That way I can stroke your hair.”<br />
<br />
Liz was hesitated for a moment, but only a moment, before she turned and inched herself backwards onto friend’s lap. Todd started to run his fingers through her brown hair, careful not to catch a tangle. Although there were a few, soon the strokes were fluid and long, running from the back of her head to the base of her neck. The hair was soft, almost too soft. Todd wasn’t used to feeling such thick and silky hair before. Although his wasn’t horrible, guys just usually don’t have hair that one would call “luxurious”. Liz had already fallen back into a sleepy, calm demeanor, letting herself go limp on Todd’s lap. The only sound that could be heard was her quiet breathing and the relaxing sound of her hair being moved by Todd’s fingers. Soon, Todd started to gently scratch her scalp, moving his nails outward from the middle of her head to the sides, doing short motions with the tips as he went along. Liz was becoming drowsy from the personal attention. Being unable to resist, she started to moan slightly from the pleasure of having her head scratched. Her toes started to curl in and out, and her legs began to slide on the couch, unable to remain still. Todd smiled.<br />
<br />
“Does that feel good Liz?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,&quot; she replied dreamily.<br />
<br />
“If it’s alright with you, I’d like to move a little lower.”<br />
<br />
She didn’t say anything. She just nodded slightly. Todd moved his hands down from her head to her shoulders and started to massage them, beginning by placing his palms on the front of the shoulders and digging his fingers into the back, pulling and pushing deeply. As soon as he began, Liz’s bottom lip started to quiver. She was clearly enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Todd continued to knead her shoulders as Liz’s moaning began again. It was irresistible. This shy girl was making such adorable noises that Todd couldn’t believe it. Here he was, alone in a dorm room with the cutest girl in the world, and she was letting him massage her. <br />
<br />
“Lo-lower…”<br />
<br />
Todd came back from his thoughts and looked down at the half-awake girl on his lap.<br />
<br />
“What did you say?”<br />
<br />
“Please, go lower…”<br />
<br />
Todd glanced down the girl’s body and saw the two mounds underneath the fabric of her shirt. Not yet, he told himself. That’ll come later. He moved past the breasts and onto the stomach. Placing his hand calmly on the middle, he lazily dragged his palm over the shirt, barely touching hard enough to put any force on her actual body. Liz looked expectantly at Todd, her eyes starting to show a want for something, a need for something. Todd knew exactly what that was, and returned to look, letting her know that her wants would be answered soon. Liz shivered once again and made an awkward smile, one that showed that she was trying her best to give a natural smile, but other stronger feelings were making it difficult. <br />
<br />
Todd took one of his hands and moved it down to the base of the white button up shirt. He moved it back up, now under the shirt, and began to draw circles around her navel. The soft smooth skin felt like velvet to Todd, and his arousal was nearing an uncomfortable status. The more that Todd touched the girl’s stomach, the more he grew to appreciate how firm it was. She didn’t have abs, but the fact that there wasn’t much fat made it so all the movements of his hands felt like they were gliding.<br />
<br />
Liz was starting to get restless. Her hips started to move up and down in slight movements, as if she was trying to adjust her pants, but she wasn’t wearing any pants and there was only one thing that she would be trying to do right now. Todd started to draw ovals on her stomach, each oval descending slightly lower on her body. Liz saw what Todd was doing and bit her lip, her moaning momentarily ceasing. The ovals were getting close to the skirt. Todd slowed down just before reaching the place that both of them wanted him to reach. Todd needed to make sure that this shy girl was ready. He didn’t want to do something that would cause trouble. However, looking down at the girl on his lap told him everything he needed to know. She was pleading with her eyes and both of her lips were pulled in to keep from making too much noise. When she opened her mouth, she only said one word in a quiet, shaky voice.<br />
<br />
“Lower…”<br />
<br />
That was all that Todd needed to hear. Snaking his hand through the skirt and undoing it, he made it loose enough so that his hand could snake its way to Liz’s lower lips. Feeling the soaked panties, Todd knew he was moments away from making this girl immeasurably happy. Leaning down to her face, Todd began to kiss her just as he slid the panties out of the way and inserted his fingers. A long, deep moan reverberated through Liz’s body and into Todd’s as they kissed. Todd repeated slid his fingers in and out, feeling the muscles in Liz contract with each push. Pulling away for only a second, Todd groaned, “I really like you…” Liz’s hips bucked in tune with the rhythm of Todd’s fingers. Moaning filled the room as the two young adults lost themselves to the simple pleasures they were giving each other. Liz couldn’t control herself, partly because of her awkwardness, but mostly because her immense need to satisfy her newly awakened libido. Taking Todd’s other hand, she drew it directly to her breast, using the few seconds she took to breathe to pant, “More, more, more. Please!” <br />
Maintaining the passionate kiss and the relentless massaging of Liz’s vagina, Todd grabbed hold of the middle of her shirt and slowly unbuttoned until Liz’s breasts were in the open air, covered only by her bra. Pulling it away, Todd started to knead the flesh, causing Liz to buck even more wildly. Her nipples were already rock hard, allowing Todd to flick them with his thumb back and forth. Todd’s dick was begging to be let out, becoming uncomfortably erect in his pants. Although Todd knew that Liz was experienced in sex already, he didn’t want to spring something on her in the heat of passion. He knew that he could just make it okay with the remote, that he could do whatever he wanted with her and reset reality afterwards, but that just didn’t feel right. If her started to act that way, then it was a slippery slope to doing something terrible, something he would regret for the rest of his life, regardless if there were any consequences for it or not. For now, he would limit this session to providing pleasure for Liz. He knew there would be future opportunities for them to go all the way. <br />
Liz was starting to pant harder than she ever had before. Todd knew that she was reaching a limit. Unlocking from his kiss, he moved his mouth down to her breasts and put his mouth over one of the nipples. Feeling the little cherry in his mouth, he began to lick and play with it, doing everything he could think of to bring Liz to the edge. It was definitely working.<br />
<br />
“Oh God! Please! Oh Todd! Yes! Yes! Right there! Keep going! God. Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes YEs YES YES YEEEEEEES!”<br />
<br />
With that, the muscles in Liz’s vagina contracted around Todd’s hand, squeezing it as cum oozed out onto the couch. Liz just laid on the couch, basking in the after-sex feeling. Todd began to stroke her hair with his good hand. Liz smiled like Todd hadn’t seen her smile before, especially not when she was the old librarian. Todd quietly said, “Was it good Liz?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” Liz responded dizzily. “It was really good.”<br />
<br />
“Do you want me to keep stroking your hair?”<br />
<br />
“Yes please,” she chirped. She closed her eyes and let her chest rise and fall with each breath. Her heart slowly stopped beating so fast and the high of sex dissipated. Then, it was just the two lovers sitting on the couch, taking in everything that happened, appreciating the moment. <br />
<br />
Todd had a thought cross his mind. He knew that Liz was special to him and that he wanted to share more moments like the one they just had. Does she deserve to know about the remote? Does she deserve to know what he did to her? All of this could come crashing down if she freaks out, but if she’s okay with it, then they could enjoy the remote together. Todd looked across the room at the remote, then down at Liz.</p>
