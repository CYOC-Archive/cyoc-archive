<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony thought he should just change Claire back to her former female body, but his pride had been hurt.  Mark seemed to have intended it as a prank, switching him from his normal slender male athlete/model body to Claire's female one, but Claire's attitude had been different.  Tony's crotch almost felt sore just thinking about how vigorously Claire had fucked him, openly reveling in every yelp of pain Tony let out as his pussy was stretched and pounded.  Tony remembered Claire laughing at his discomfort and repeatedly slapping Tony's widened female ass for the casual pleasure of it.<br />
<br />
No, Claire was not just joking around.  She'd said it openly.  &quot;I love dominating you, my girl&quot; Claire had chuckled after fucking Tony painfully up his temporarily female ass and then fetching Tony a firm swat across his involuntarily female behind.  &quot;You should have been the one with the wide tush.  You should always have been the girl&quot;<br />
<br />
That was what stuck with Tony.  You should always have been the girl!  What had happened to Claire that she was so aggressive?  It can't have just been having my male body.  Whatever it was, Tony was going to show her who was the man.  He didn't dwell on it, but part of his motivation was an insecurity that maybe there was something to the crack that Tony should have been the girl.  Claire had laughed that all Tony ever seemed to do was sit on his superlative pair of buns.  &quot;If you're gonna spend all your time sitting on 'em you should have a big cushiony pair&quot; Claire had laughed, lifting suddenly blond bimbo Tony off the ground by his voluptuous hips as Toni had sputtered an objection in vain.<br />
<br />
Tony took a deep breath and shoved open the door to the bedroom where Claire lay lolling on the bed in an identical copy of Tony's body.  &quot;This body ain't big enough for the two of us&quot; he declared.<br />
<br />
A half hour later, Mark arrived at the Heath house with clothes for Tony as his brother had requested.  His brother met him at the front door and led him up to the bedroom where he showed him a sleeping Claire.  He had the chronivac powered laptop running on the dresser.  &quot;You may have thought that you were just playing a little joke on me, making me into Claire, but you didn't realize what you'd done to her&quot; said his brother as he ran through the personality menus on the computer.  Mark blushed in embarassment as his brother showed how a series of 99th percentile choices in personality traits such as &quot;aggressiveness&quot; &quot;arrogance&quot; and completely sexually &quot;dominant&quot; on the scale from submissive to dominant.<br />
&quot;You created a psychological monster who got her kicks out of fucking my little pussy till it hurt&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, bro&quot; Mark mumbled with downcast eyes.  <br />
<br />
But his big brother gave him a pat on the ass and told him to forget about it.  He hustled him out of the Heaths' house to let his girlfriend sleep.  But instead of heading home, Mark's older brother had a suggestion.  Eric had once told them of how you could hide in a certain part of the YMCA and go swimming or whatever else you wanted to do after the place had closed.  <br />
<br />
They ran to the Y and even snuck inside without having to pay at the front desk.  It was almost closing time and the two St. Martins hid in the room off the weight room described by Eric.  The lights went out, they came out of hiding and Mark ran down to the pool area.  While his older brother carefully set up the chronivac in the bench bleachers overlooking the pool, Mark tore off his clothes and jumped in.  A starry full mooned sky shown into the pool area through the huge, almost all glass wall on the other side of the pool as Mark frolicked, alone in the pool.  Meanwhile, his older brother typed away at the keyboard.  Finally, Mark noticed as he floated on his back.<br />
&quot;Whatcha doin?&quot; he asked just as his older brother hit the 'enter key'.  Immediately, Mark felt an electric wave pass through him.  His ankles suddenly seemed glued together and his elbows stuck to his sides.  <br />
&quot;Hey!  What'd you do to me?&quot;<br />
His older brother started humming the theme song to &quot;Flipper&quot; as Mark noticed that his skin was turning gray and slick and his face growing out into a pointy snout.  In just a few moments more, Mark was a dolphin, albeit one with the ability to speak.  At first, he was full of anxiety.  No arms.  No legs.  How do I keep swimming like this?  But after just a minute of effortlessly negotiating the water, worrying about being a dolphin seemed silly.  Mark spent a little while doing every trick he could remember seeing a dolphin do.  He was his own Sea World show.  But, in that small pool there was only so much he could do and he soon tired of the antics possible to him.<br />
&quot;Okay, turn me back now&quot; he demanded.<br />
&quot;No&quot; laughed his older brother.<br />
&quot;Whadda you mean, 'no'?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm gonna leave you like that and take away your ability to speak and watch you get sent to some aquarium or something, as a joke, you know, just like you turning me female against my will&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, come on!  You can't ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~&quot;<br />
A shocked dolphin Mark found himself stripped of the ability to speak and watched in shock as his older brother picked up the chronivac and left the pool area.  Mark panicked.  He swam as fast as he could around the pool.  He even swam up out of the pool onto the tiled floor.  But there was no sign of his older brother.<br />
<br />
Finally, after 15 minutes, his older brother returned, laughing uproariously at the panic in Mark's dolphin eyes.  A few keystrokes on the laptop and Mark felt an electric wave pass through him.  Immediately, his dorsal fin shrank away and his side fins started to stretch out into arms.  As Mark tugged furiously, almost trying to speed the process along, his tail gradually split into two human legs.  Mark's skin became his pale, perfect boy male model hue, his short cropped hair returned and he became his beautiful boy self again.<br />
&quot;Not funny big bro!  Not funny!&quot;<br />
But his older brother clearly disagreed.  He laughed and laughed at getting to turn the tables on Mark who followed him out of the pool area and up to the weight and exercise room without even realizing where they were going.<br />
&quot;You've had 15 minutes of fear&quot; said his older brother as they walked past rows and rows of dumbells.  &quot;I almost got stuck as a big breasted bimbo.  Claire was so dominant over me.  My god.  You're lucky she didn't focus on you&quot;<br />
&quot;Why would she focus on me?&quot; grunted naked Mark absent mindedly curling a dumbell.<br />
&quot;Why not?  You're a cute little guy&quot;<br />
Mark frowned at hearing words like that from his brother.  &quot;But she was you, wasn't she, I mean, physically?  Didn't she want big buxom girls like you?&quot; chuckled Mark tapping his brother's chest where giant tits must have been.<br />
&quot;Physically yes, but mentally still herself.  When she turned me female, I still had some of my old sexual personna.  I still thought girls were luscious.  She might still have wanted a hot little piece of vealcake like you, Marky&quot; his brother replied and traced one finger along the line of the arc of Mark's buttock.<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
The two of them laughed and wrestled a bit, Mark quickly succumbing to his brother's greater strength.  <br />
&quot;You need to workout&quot; he said, releasing Mark and pulling him over to the side of the room.  &quot;Here try this one.  It's the new thing&quot; he said as he tied red exercise tubes tight around Mark's wrists and the other ends to tubes running through weight stacks.<br />
&quot;Hey, how does this work?&quot; Mark demanded but he got no response as his older brother pushed a pommel horse, lowered to just below waist height under him.<br />
&quot;Hey?!  What the hell are you doing?&quot; asked a frantic Mark just before he was casually pushed over the pommel horse, his little ass up in the air in a classic over a barrel posture.  Mark couldn't even get up off the pommel horse, he was so perfectly positioned.  Behind him, he saw his brother stripping and laughing, laughing a carefree laugh.  <br />
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Mark pleaded as he felt fingers fanned across his drum tight little buns and then two palms pressing hard to spread his buttocks apart.<br />
&quot;Haven't you guessed by now?  Did you really think your bookworm brother would beat me in a fair fight?&quot;<br />
Oh no.  Mark's mind raced with panic that only increased as he felt the giant mushroom top prepuce of his brother's penis pressing against his anus.  Mark squeezed tight, refusing entrance.  Then he felt a punch to his side.  He gasped and momentarily lost control.<br />
&quot;Ow-ow-ow-ow-owwwwwwwwwww!&quot; Mark yelped in increasingly higher pitch as his brother's girlfriend, in his brother's body thrust a penis so far into him, Mark thought it would come out his mouth.  The pain was considerable, but what hurt almost as much was the way warm skin against his own bare body felt so good and the friction along a certain part of his insides, next to his prostate, felt humiliatingly good.  <br />
<br />
Over and over, Claire had her way with him.  She really hadn't intended to fuck his little ass so many times, but couldn't resist brutalizing his magical little buns each time he pleaded to be left alone.  She even whipped his round little ass crimson with the the buckle of a weight lifter's belt she found lying around.  She noted with delight Mark's uncontrollable erection at the vigorous stimulation his prostate gland G spot got and made him shout out things like &quot;I'm a bitch!  I'm a gay little bitch!&quot; to avoid her threat of taking her time as she fucked him and making it last even longer.<br />
<br />
Finally, Claire got up from her penis receptacle, giving Mark's red ass a whimper inducing slap as she exited the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;God!  What now?!&quot; Mark groaned.</p>
