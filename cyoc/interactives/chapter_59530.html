<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan thought and decided to become a statue. He thought of the closest place where they had statues, which would be the museum. He decided he would change into his neighbor's muscle car, drive himself to the museum, and change back to human, so he could become a statue. Jeremy agreed to drive Ryan, since a car driving itself would attract attention.<br />
<br />
Ryan waited for his neighbor to finish washing his target, when he walked up to the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that sure is a nice car.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; said the Neighbor. &quot;It's funny, everyone says that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can't imagine why.&quot; said Ryan. He looked at his watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops.&quot; said Ryan. &quot;I've got to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ryan ran off, he patted the car. He felt the familiar tingling feeling, and ran into his garage. Jeremy hit the door-opener button and turned the lights on so he'd be able to watch his twin brother transforming into his new ride.<br />
<br />
As the garage door closed, Ryan felt the tingling feeling get stronger. The transformation was about to begin.<br />
<br />
Ryan first felt his hair shriveling up and sucking into his head. His armpit hair, chest hair, leg hair and pubic hair did the same. Ryan quickly stripped naked and threw his clothes off to the side of the garage. Ryan got down on his hands and knees. Jeremy watched in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Ryan noticed that his shoulders were expanding, getting wider. His shoulders were also growing, gaining muscle. His torso also expanded, layers upon layers of muscle being added to Ryan. He was growing, fast. Soon he was twice as large as he was before. Then, Ryan's legs started to shrink into his body. His knees melted into his changing form. His legs were now only an inch in length. His feet remained unchanged. Next, Ryan's arms did the same, shrinking into his body until his arms were only an inch in length each, but still his hands remained unaltered.<br />
<br />
Ryan next felt his legs reforming, becoming one appendage, and he noticed his arms were doing the same. His feet and hands remained seperate. Ryan's neck shrunk into his body, until his head and torso were one. Ryan could no longer move his head, as the sides of his head stretched, attaching to his shoulders. Ryan's nose melted away, and it's former spot smoothed out. Jeremy watched, and felt himself getting an erection watching his twin brother transforming into a muscle car.<br />
<br />
Ryan felt an odd feeling in his ass. His buttocks suddenly grew, stretching outwards, taking the lower half of is body with it. His butt stretched out on both sides, and what was left of his butt cheeks changed into headlights. Ryan was lost in a state of sexual bliss. He felt adrenaline throughout his entire body.<br />
<br />
Ryan's hips stretched out and expanded, joining the lower part of his body, which was now more car than human. Ryan's chest flexed as his nipples darkened until they were grey. His nipples opened up, and grew wider and wider. Ryan's nipples suddenly burst out from his body, growing and growing, twisting around his chest, going in and out of his body. His belly button did the same, and Ryan's nipples and belly button became tubing. Ryan's pecs stretched towards the ground a bit, making room for soon-to-come seats.<br />
<br />
Ryan's back suddenly started stretching, contorting and twisting. Ryan's back stretched upwards, forming the cabin. Seats grew out of his shoulder blades, a steering wheel formed out of what had been his neck.<br />
<br />
Ryan was lost in sexual euphoria. He wasn't feeling any pain, and instead, he felt immense pleasure. It was like a continuous orgasm that wasn't ending. Ryan's face bulged out, his mouth widening to form a chrome grill. His eyes stretched apart to opposite sides of his head, forming headlights. The only part of his head that wasn't there was his ears, which had relocated and were stretching into side mirrors.<br />
<br />
Jeremy had a massive erection as he watched Ryan morph into a muscle car. However, Ryan still had hands and feet where his tires should have been. As Jeremy watched in awe, Ryan's feet flexed, then formed tread patterns. Ryan's feet rolled into the shape of tires. Ryan's hands formed fists, which expanded into tires, but did not change color. In fact, Ryan's whole muscle car body was still Ryan's skin tone. Ryan watched as Ryan's skin hardened and became chrome. Ryan's chrome then turned red.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was amazed at his brother's transformation, and was amazed that he had gotten a muscle car. Jeremy opened Ryan's door and sat down in the drivers' seat. Jeremy took a breath and realized that Ryan even smelled like a new car. Jeremy realized that he had no keys to turn Ryan on. Suddenly, Ryan roared to life, still having consciousness, and all five senses. Jeremy smiled and reached for the gear shift. It felt squishy. Jeremy looked down and realized that Ryan's erect penis was the gear shift, and it had not yet transformed.<br />
<br />
Jeremy watched as Ryan's manhood began to stiffen. It then grew larger and larger. Ryan's shaft straightened and turned to polished metal. The head of Ryan's penis expanded until it was a perfect sphere, then became metal. Ryan's testicles expanded, and formed the rest of the gear shift. Jeremy put Ryan into ignition, then pressed the button on the garage-door opener and drove Ryan out of the garage. Ryan was having orgasms as he sped across town in his new chrome body. Jeremy finally got to the museum, and parked Ryan behind the building so no one would see Ryan's transformation. After he made sure no one was looking, Jeremy placed his hand on Ryan's headlight. <br />
<br />
Ryan's muscle car body began to quiver. Jeremy watched in amazement as Ryan's radio antennae sucked into his body. Ryan's red chrome began to change color, shifting to match Ryan's skin tone. Ryan's car doors glazed over. Jeremy looked inside Ryan's transforming car body, and watched the gear shift morph into Ryan's penis and testicles. Ryan had an erection. Ryan's tires began to shift shape. Fingers and toes began to extend out of the tire treads, which were stretching into Ryan's hands and feet. Then, the car began to shrink, all the while stretching and contorting, as more and more of Ryan's body became noticeable. Ryan's roof collapsed onto his body, his windows squishing into nothing. Ryan's car roof began to become a human back. Jeremy watched as Ryan's back flexed as his spine reformed. <br />
<br />
Ryan's hood glazed over, and Jeremy watched as hair began to grow out of it, starting to form Ryan's haircut. Ryan's headlights and entire front end began to shrink quickly. His chrome grill began to squish into itself, opening up and forming a human mouth. Ryan's headlights began to change back into eyes. Suddenly, Ryan's human arms and legs pushed out of where his tires were. Ryan's side mirrors moved towards Ryan's now half-human, half-car head, and morphed into ears. Ryan's trunk squished, forming the shape of Ryan's buttocks. A crack defined itself, and then Ryan's buttocks changed from red to Ryan's skin color. Ryan's head was now completely human. Ryan's neck squirted out. Ryan's massive car torso began to squish into itself. Jeremy and Ryan heard bones forming and cracking. Ryan's tubing sucked back into his human chest. His nipples lightened, and became human. Ryan's abs defined themselves. Lastly, Ryan's armpit, pubic and head hair grew back to it's normal length. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
Jeremy tossed Ryan a bag. Ryan looked inside and saw his clothes, realizing he was naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay,&quot; said Ryan, grabbing a jar and then tossing the bag back to Jeremy. &quot;I have my own way of getting in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan opened the jar to reveal a fly. Ryan placed his finger on the fly, and felt the tingling feeling. The fly flew away, but Jeremy was already done with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back tomorrow after the museum has closed. I'll be the statue everyone will be wondering where it came from.&quot; said Ryan to Jeremy, as he felt his transformation begin.<br />
<br />
First, Ryan's hair, armpit hair and pubic hair sucked into his body. Jeremy watched as his twin brother's body began to change. The transformation started with Ryan's penis and testicles, which slowly sucked itself into his crotch, leaving nothing behind. Ryan's legs began to change. His leg joints disappeared. His legs became single-jointed limbs, that resembled sticks. Ryan's human feet collapsed into themselves, hardening and becoming the base of Ryan's human-skin colored fly legs. Ryan's arms did the same.<br />
<br />
Ryan's ears sucked into his head. Ryan groaned with pleasure as his eyes swelled, forming the compound eyes of a fly. Jeremy watched again with fascination, admittedly, seeing his twin brother change into a fly was giving him an erection. Ryan groaned again as 2 fly legs pushed their way out of his human chest. His torso began to stretch and contort, splitting into 3 sections. What was left of Ryan's human back suddenly sprouted thin gossamer wings. Next, the human skin all over Ryan's body began to harden and turn black, like a fly's. Ryan's human sized body began to shrink. Ryan groaned again as his body dwindled to the size of a fly. Lastly, Ryan's human nose vanished into his head, while his mouth twisted into a fly's. Ryan had completely transformed himself into a fly. <br />
<br />
Jeremy watched as his twin brother lifted off the ground and flew over to the museum entrance. Since the doors were automatic, Jeremy stepped in front of the doorway, opening the doors. Ryan flew into the museum. Ryan would have to wait until the museum closed in order to change into a statue, which, luckily, would happen in 5 minutes. Ryan flew up to one of the marble pillars at the front of the statue exhibit, making sure to stay high enough so that he wouldn't be seen, or worse, swatted.<br />
<br />
After the museum had closed and the security guards had made their final once-over the museum to make sure some rowdy teenagers or a homeless person hadn't decided to spend the night, Ryan watched as the museum doors were locked up. He was alone inside the museum. Ryan flew down from the pillar and landed in front of the statue exhibit. Ryan concentrated on his human form and felt the tingling feeling begin.<br />
<br />
Ryan's body expanded, growing and growing until he was his normal human height. 2 of his his fly legs sucked into his torso, which was widening out of 3 parts. His remaining legs began to thicken. Human tissue and muscle began to grown on the legs, turning them back to Ryan's human skin color, and they eventually became human arms and legs. The ends of his fly legs began to thicken as human fingers and toes squirted out, forming Ryan's hands and feet. <br />
<br />
Ryan's black, hard exoskeleton began to soften, and formed human skin. Ryan's head began to shrink. His compound eyes began to shrink into his head, morphing into human eyes. His mouth reformed. His nose appeared. Ears pushed out of the sides of his head. His body structure reshaped itself. Bones reformed and cracked as they shifted around inside his changing body. Between Ryan's legs, human testicles and a penis began to push out. This caused Ryan to groan with his newly reformed vocal cords. <br />
<br />
As Ryan's human body returned to it's original state, abs and muscle formed. Ryan's hair sprouted back on his head. He noticed his armpit and pubic hair was also re-sprouting. After a few moments, Ryan was once again a teenage boy. He was finally about to change into what he had been waiting for. Nude, but not really caring, Ryan strolled into the statue exhibit. He looked at all the statues closely, before finally selecting Michelangelo's David. It was a no-brainer, really. The statue had always turned him on, and he wanted to have a perfect human body. Ryan decided that he would become a statue, but one at the main entrance. Therefore, he would have to be as realistic as possible, but with one difference. He would also have to be bigger than the replica.<br />
<br />
&quot;That shouldn't be a problem.&quot; thought Ryan. He placed his hand on the foot of the replica of David, feeling the familiar tingle throughout his naked body. Concentrating on the statue, but also on the alterations he wanted, Ryan ran on his bare feet over to the main entrance, climbing up on the empty pedestal behind the information desk. Ryan groaned as his feet began to meld with the pedestal. He could no longer move his feet. Ryan's feet began to exert a human-skin colored liquid out of their base. This liquid formed a pool around Ryan's feet. This would be the base of the statue. Ryan first noticed his hair was changing. It shortened and curled, matching David's. Ryan groaned with sexual pleasure as his body began to change. His pecs hardened and defined themselves. Ryan watched as his abs defined themselves more, and more, until they were more than the real David's! Ryan's shoulders cracked as they widened. Ryan's arms began to swell with muscle. <br />
<br />
Ryan's legs began to bulk up as well, as layers and layers of muscle swelled within Ryan's legs. Even his hands and feet looked more muscular now. Ryan watched, groaning again as his penis began to swell. Bigger and bigger it got, until it was twice the size of the real statue's. Ryan had become a perfect human version of the famous statue. Without warning, Ryan began to grow. He watched as the floor rushed away from his growing form. Ryan grew until his head almost touched the ceiling of the museum. <br />
<br />
Ryan looked down at his feet, noticing that they had turned white. He bent over, and felt them. They were marble. Ryan put his body in the familiar pose of the statue as his lower half became entirely marble. As his gigantic body changed from flesh to stone, final changes were made. A little more muscle here and there. Once the changes reached his head, Ryan felt his face rearranging itself until it matched David's perfect looks. Ryan could almost ejaculate, he was so horny. He still had consciousness, and somehow he was still alive, despite the fact he could not breathe, and he had no pulse.<br />
<br />
When morning came, guests rushed in, and looked in awe at Ryan's perfect body. Since he was just a replica, people were allowed to touch his perfect marble body, although they could only reach his feet. But whenever somebody touched him, a wave of pleasure went through Ryan's perfect marble body. He loved having everyone's attention. The employees had no idea how this gigantic replica of David got there, but they decided not to make a big deal, because it was attracting a lot of attention. Ryan loved his power, and he loved his perfect, sexy stone body.</p>
