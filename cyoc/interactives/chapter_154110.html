<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly, James began to stir, he felt a damp chill about his body, like he were naked and lying on a beach, having got drunk and slept the whole night near the water. Strange memories of an argument, and of feeling a pin prick..., &quot;Oh, no that was reality, not a dream, but something done to me, me, me, what about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A mind transfer, yes, that was what happened, James recalled how from a beautiful young woman said she had cast on him a spell. She had need to practice her magic, and chose him as a volunteer. She spoke about her wishing to transfer his mind and soul into as trade bodies with an animal. <br />
<br />
If real, and maybe it was real, he felt odd, as held a memory of having urinated in public, but for some reason floating in his head, such seemed as insignificant.  &quot;Dah,&quot; what did she say about how the spell was contrived, or held James feeling acclimated to his new form, being not the human he was born, but sent to live, reside in control of an animal body?<br />
<br />
A sudden noise, a sharp sound what worked to urge James as to stand up and be prepared to defend himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey who is there,&quot; James meant to exclaim but what he felt and heard issued out his agape mouth sounded to him as of a Jackass, braying.<br />
<br />
Looking around to discover his whereabouts, James took a stride step forward, feeling odd, as if he had four legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the, naa, no way, &quot; James thought to himself, How could what he recalled was real, as then he remembered her, and her beauty. The very thoughts of his seeing her worked to bring on a lusty feeling of an arousal. James tried to smile as he thought of when he first saw her, and of how she made him wish they could be friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, was she cute, and her tits, so aroused, the nipples tenting her blouse...,&quot; James thought, as then he sighed, his sigh coming out past his lips, being a long-drawn &quot;Hee..., Haw!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, oh God no, am I dumb or what, making the sighing sound like some horny Jackass!<br />
<br />
A really sensual remembered thought worked to give James a sense of loins as aroused. As him getting a hard-on from a pretty woman, that was nothing new. What felt different was how his penis seemed to gain immense weight, as felt drastically bloated, and like he were stock naked, the thing swung free, as if there for all around to see him being aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snort..., hee-haw,&quot; James heard and felt then the hot breath warming his penis.<br />
<br />
Turning his dull bulky self, James thought to exclaim, as say, &quot;Hey there,&quot; but he then let go a bray out his mouth.<br />
<br />
Even when he turned quick to confront the entity there giving him a blowjob,  just imagine his state of surprise to feeling his mighty, weighty cock swing and it slapping, go bonk at a furry, rounded belly, <br />
<br />
&quot;Snort,&quot; and hearing this, James saw standing there a gray donkey. He inhaled and his nose told his kinked mind that the donkey was a female, and as well she in her state of sexual need.<br />
<br />
About then four other donkeys came into his view, as James blinked, and stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what, I must have fallen over the protective fence into the donkey and zebra exhibit?&quot; James thought, as he began turning to see, he felt again the sensations of being naked, aroused with his penis erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no this is so very wrong, I need to get out of here...,&quot; James thought, but part of what he thought , he exclaimed aloud, but he brayed again, being loud, seemingly as nervous. His nerves were attacked worse when the close-up donkey did turn her tail toward James, and lifting her tail, he saw her black vulva lips do a equine winking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell&#39;s bells, but her butt looks so crude,&quot; James thought, but again, some of what he thought he expelled as a loud bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, but indeed,&quot; James thought, the scent coming off the jennet donkey was pungent, rather spicy, he oddly liked the smell. She, the donkey stood ready to accept the bulk weight of a male wanting to mate with her. Her poised stance was oddly alluring to James, as he strode slowly closer to her, his erection felt stiffer, as his libido strengthened.<br />
<br />
Sniffing then about the jennet rump, James backed away three times, feeling humiliated by what he felt an urge to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw..., hee-haw,&quot; James exclaimed, as he felt again and heard his voice bray.<br />
<br />
Stepping forward, he sniffed the jennet rump again, but her weeping juices bade to him he should give her rump a lick, and savor her flavor if she be ready to mate.<br />
<br />
Something really forceful in him told James the female donkey was ready to breed, and he, James should leap up, mount the jennet, and bring his hard penis to touch, and/or thrust it inside her hot body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha, what, whoa what am I DOING...!&quot; James half thinking and braying, while his penis spread wide her black folds of sensuality, and his cock slid into her depths. A sensed wild desire enveloped James, and he standing humped over the female donkey, she had him standing there in bold, plain view, was thrusting, mating with her, a she animal.<br />
<br />
The other donkeys stood not far, and after James had fired his mighty load, he turned to them, sniffing the sir, realizing that at least two of the donkeys were wanting him to do as much or more!  <br />
<br />
James snorted a blast of exhaled air from what he felt as broader nostrils. He then inhaled and knew the similar scent he had sniffed from the donkey just had mated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there stud, you started your new day with a servicing one of your herd and harem!&quot; Said a man standing just outside the perimeter fence.  James heard said, as understood the spoken comment. What her heard made him to turn his head, gawking back over his withers, to see his body being that of a Jack male donkey.<br />
<br />
As with his donkey cock still sunken deep and warmed by a lustier body, James relished the realization that he, had become somehow a donkey animal. His realization of being a donkey and having just bred a jennet donkey meant top him he had not done a vile act of bestiality; as two being donkeys, mating is not thought of by humans as bestial, or immoral.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, mating can be as feel like great fun, especially when fornicating as a male donkey!&quot; James thought to his new self.</p>
