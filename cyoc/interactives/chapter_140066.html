<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy laughed. “Man, you gotta stop talking about your bedroom last night! This is a public pool!” He playfully punched Matt in the shoulder, who grinned his sly smile.<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t my fault! I’m just saying that with her being away for two months and all, banging her was a pretty explosive experience!” he chucked.<br />
<br />
Harvey snorted from the other side of Matt. “Listening to you guys argue is like listening to two walls.” he smirked, reclining in his deck chair with his signature aviators.<br />
<br />
“Come on you guys!” John yelled from in the pool. “You can tan just as well in here!”<br />
<br />
Andy, Matt, Harvey, and John were all good friends who had just ended their senior year of high school. The 19-year-olds made girls swoon wherever they went. Andy was the classic jock. He was the star of the wrestling team, and had short dirty blonde hair and a decent build. Matt was the jokester of the group, and had short black hair and dark brown eyes which always lit up when he thought of a joke. Harvey was a gymnast, and a good one too. His stylish brown hair and serious face had caused several girls to faint at their school. John was the most sociable of the group, and was always cycling, running, hiking, or doing whatever he felt like. His short brown hair and classic boy next door looks had won him several short relationships in the past.<br />
<br />
“Wonder what they’re going to do about that mess,” Matt pondered, glancing at a news alert on his phone. “Say it didn’t happen?” he laughed. <br />
<br />
Several days ago, an explosion had taken place in a nearly empty area of northern Nevada. Along with the lack of explanation, the cloud of smoke released by the explosion had strangely not dissipated.<br />
<br />
None of them had tried to show they were worried when they got the news that a cloud of wind had pushed the “smoke” west, towards them.<br />
<br />
“Eh, I’m sure it’s nothing,” Andy said. “Probably another overly dramatic story in the making.”<br />
<br />
John glanced up at the sky, noticing several low-lying white clouds. “Damn, hope we don’t get bad weather today. It was the perfect day to come out here.”<br />
<br />
“And shoe off for the ladies,” Matt mused, flexing a bicep. <br />
<br />
Harvey grinned and rolled his eyes. “You’re gonna make me vomit before you do anything else.”<br />
<br />
Andy laughed. “I’m gonna take a nap, so nobody disturb me or I’ll punch you through a wall.”<br />
<br />
Andy wasn’t the biggest person around, but he was known for being incredibly strong. Earlier in the year when one of the football players had harrassed his girlfriend Sandra, he had flipped them over his shoulder and pinned them to the ground. You didn’t mess with Andy.<br />
<br />
After a while, John hopped out of the pool and stretched, making a few girls giggle. He toweled off and laid down on his chair. As he put on his sunglasses, he noticed something odd. Those clouds were on the ground now, like mist. <br />
<br />
“Hey Harv. Look at that.” Harvey pulled off his aviators and looked over at the advancing mist.<br />
<br />
“I’m not liking the looks of that.”<br />
<br />
Apparently the lifeguard had a similar opinion.<br />
<br />
“Everyone out of the pool!” he called. “We are closing early.” He looked uneasy.<br />
<br />
The mist seemed to be advancing faster, almost as if it was hunting them. Harvey, John, and Matt stood up and slowly backed away towards the other end of the pool. The crowd had began to gather there. Enough people had seen that movie “The Mist” to know this wasn’t good.<br />
<br />
“Shoot!” Harvey yelled. “Andy!”<br />
<br />
Andy, who had been napping had been missed by the others as they had fled from the oncoming mist.<br />
<br />
Andy stirred and yawned. “How long have I been out guys?” glancing over at the now empty chairs. He looked over at the crowd now at the opposite end of the pool looking behind him with worried looks. And he turned just in time to get a lungful of gas.<br />
<br />
He coughed, then without warning lurnched back flat in his deck chair. “Ohhhhhh....” he moaned as his dick lurched and grew slightly.<br />
<br />
“What the hell...” he moaned as his body was racked by waves of pleasure. His red swim trunks started to stretch around the bulge in his pants. He growled and thrusted as his dick grew in size rapidly. The feeling of his package filling his swim trucks was ridiculously erotic, and he moaned and managed to lift his head enough to see the bulge in his pants growing both out and down. His head was thrown back by another wave of pleasure as his package swelled explosively again. He gave a final shout as his dick swelled continuously for a solid 5 seconds and gained just as many inches in a grand finale.</p>
