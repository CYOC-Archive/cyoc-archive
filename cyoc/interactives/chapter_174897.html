<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The infinity serum defied the laws of physics as the syringe fell to the floor and broke. The strange black serum spilt into two different streams<br />
<br />
As Natalia fell to the ground due to being released from her confines. One of them hit her open wound on her neck. It formed a weird bandage on her wound. Then it felt like the liquid was invading her body. The nanites were modifying her genetic code and altering her organs. She felt herself getting stronger her lungs, heart, kidneys all gaining strength. Her muscle fibers got much stronger. Even though she kept the same heavenly shape her muscles were 10,000,000x stronger. Her wounds were healed. Though the sudden strength made her pass out.<br />
<br />
Dr. Gomez was near the explosion and was burned badly. Half of his face and parts of his torso were vaporized and the curved knife used to cut Natalia still soaked in her blood pierced his body. His lab coat and pants now burnt also had the smell of his burnt flesh and he was half naked. Then the second stream of the black serum entered the knife wound. Like Natalia, he felt immense strength go through his veins as the nanites were altering his genetic code and organs. The nanites entered the site were Natalia&#39;s blood was entering Juan&#39;s body and thinking that this foreign substance was apart of the genetic material they needed to imprint, a rather interesting side effect occurred.    <br />
<br />
Soon after his wounds healed he felt like his insides were burning. His frail 5’2 frame gained about 4 inches. His stomach became toned and he gained some abs. His skull reformed. His hair changed from red to a dark shade of black and grew out fast from his scalp. He was in pain as his testicles were on fire, all the sperm was being destroyed. His prostate just went into thin air. His sexual organs reformed into female ones. His brown eyes became a bright blue. Then it felt like his brain was being rebuilt. Neurons were being burned and recreated all at once. She passed out as well.<br />
<br />
After 1 hour Natalia woke up she needed to finish the job. She was going to grab and knife and with her newfound strength was going to kill Dr. Gomez. As she was reaching for the knife she saw herself.<br />
<br />
One Natalia was wearing her issued light tactical armor the other in a burnt lab coat and pants with part of her breasts showing. They looked at each other.<br />
<br />
Natalia in the tactical armor jumped at what she thought was a new super-powered Gomez that also looked like her. She needed to kill him fast the thought of his ass impersonating her using the network the bloodletters have was horrifying. The other Natalia realized that she was wearing his old clothes knowing the other Natalia would try to kill her.<br />
<br />
Natalia tried to kill her twin but they just kept countering each other<br />
<br />
Then<br />
<br />
”Listen, Natalia, I am not Gomez!” letting her guard down in the process. Natalia surrendered<br />
<br />
The Natalia wearing the tactical armor was confused. Gomez was not the type of person to give up easily. If he had the combat skills of Natalia he would stop at nothing until Kayla was dead<br />
<br />
Was this new Natalia a clone of her?<br />
<br />
She stopped as well.<br />
<br />
Natalia and her twin sat down<br />
<br />
”Prove to me that you are me.” Tactical Natalia said<br />
<br />
”Passcode X-2-5-7-9-6--89-delta 15”<br />
<br />
”Okay you told me the passcode for the-”<br />
<br />
”gun safe in the warehouse in New York”<br />
<br />
”Okay question 1”<br />
<br />
A 39 question test was administered<br />
<br />
Natalia probed her new twin and she could tell that Gomez was not in there. It seems that Gomez’s brain was somehow changed into a copy of Natalia’s. Though Natalia discovered her twin was able to retain Gomez’s knowledge of technology, his pure intellect, and cyber mafia connections all inside a perfect copy of a highly skilled bloodletters. It also was nice that these two Natalia’s were literal super soldiers at this point.<br />
<br />
Natalia wasn’t sure if it was the serum or the fact she just had a long day but as she was probing her clone her pussy was getting wet. The smell of burnt flesh wasn&#39;t bad either.<br />
<br />
The lab coat Natalia made the first move. She kissed her own angelic lips. It felt like pure bliss. She knew she was seductive but she didn’t understand just how until now. She wanted to fuck this woman that just so happened to her. The other Natalia wanted to fuck herself as well. They wanted... no needed to have rough sex right now. The Natalia in the lab coat ripped off the tactical armor clean off her twin. Natalia was impressed with her new found power. Natalia ripped her twin&#39;s barley intact lab coat and pants off. <br />
<br />
Their mouths were watering as they saw their sexy naked bodies. Natalia licked her twin’s breasts and her twin was moaning in absolute delight<br />
<br />
“Fuck yes fuck yes fuck yes”<br />
<br />
She kept suckling for 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
“Dammit stop teasing me fuck me!”<br />
<br />
Using her enhanced fast twitch muscles in her hand Natalia shoved her fingers with a new found speed inside her twin’s pussy. Natalia was experiencing an amazing pleasure. Natalia wanted more, getting up she went to the drill with her blood all over it. She started to lick all the glorious blood off of it.<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t be selfish!” Her twin said<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry sexy I have something for you.”<br />
<br />
Kayla went to the torture table with her blood on it and smeared it on her ass and tits.<br />
<br />
Her twin on the ground was hungry.<br />
<br />
Natalia went into downward dog and her twin licked every drop of blood and the ate her pussy out.<br />
<br />
Natalia and Natalia used the knife handle as a dildo. They then scissored each other. Little did they know that the Speaker had a a tracker on her and requested a C.I.A. strike team be sent as back up.<br />
<br />
The strike team was shocked to find Natalia Berryman, a bloodletter part of a group of assassins so deadly almost every other intelligence agency and military branch did not want to mess with ,was fucking a clone of herself like there was no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The speaker received a call at 3:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“Hello Speaker Hernandez, this is strike team leader Charlie D’mayo and we found blood angel Berryman.”<br />
<br />
“What about Gomez? Is blood angel Berryman alive? I need to know strike leader. D’mayo”<br />
<br />
“Speaker Hernandez I do not know how to answer your question this is something you’ll need to see for yourself.”<br />
<br />
“Dammit tell me!”<br />
<br />
“I cannot explain what is going on. We will bring them back to base and you can see for yourself”<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait them?&quot;<br />
<br />
D&#39;mayo hung up<br />
<br />
The speaker arrived to the black site base the following morning and nothing could prepare him for what he was about to see.<br />
<br />
He saw two Natalia Berryman. One was wearing a black shirt and one was wearing a red shirt.<br />
<br />
“You have a lot of explaining to do”<br />
<br />
After about 3 hours of questioning Speaker Hernandez was still trying to wrap his head around this.<br />
<br />
“So you were exposed to an experimental drug then your target who was also exposed to the same drug turned into a clone of you at which point you had sexual relations with your target turned clone?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Speaker Hernandez”<br />
<br />
“Okay...So I am going to assume that you in the red shirt were and/or are Juan Gomez?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Speaker Hernandez.... I was Dr. Juan Gomez but I am Natalia Berryman now”<br />
<br />
“So you have the memories of Julio Gomez and his knowledge yet you are not him”<br />
<br />
“Yes it seems that when the serum mixed the blood from bloodletter  Berryman the serum overwrote Dr. Gomez with another Natalia Berryman in this case me”<br />
<br />
“Is there anyway to reverse the serum?”<br />
<br />
“Yes but it would result in the death of the person.”<br />
<br />
“I see, you are the only person with the knowledge of how this “infinity” is made correct”<br />
<br />
“Yes”<br />
<br />
“Blood Angel Berryman”<br />
<br />
“Yes” they both said<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand how any of this is happened and I am will probably never get how any of this is possible, you stopped a threat to national and potentially world security. You are know the senior blood angel and I am tasking you with finding a new blood angel to replace your mentor Alexander Smith&quot;<br />
<br />
“Representative Hernandez thank you. I have already found a replacement. I would like to add the clone of me to fill in the second position slot. She is more than qualified as first she is a clone of me, she is enhanced with the infinity serum, and she has access to all the contacts of Dr. Juan Gomez’s associates and his financial assets.<br />
<br />
“How do we know she isn’t just faking being you and backstabs us later?”<br />
<br />
“I understand your concerns and I will keep a close eye on her and if she does turn, I will kill her”<br />
<br />
“You make a fair point, I will grant you this addition. Though I would like for your twin to change her name it just seems weird referring to both of you as Natalia&quot;<br />
<br />
“Understood” said red shirt Kayla<br />
<br />
The two made it back to their main headquarters. They decided to have dinner at a bistro. One Natalia wore a red dress with her hair in a bun and the other wore a blue dress with her hair in a high ponytail. They each ordered a glass of Alexander&#39;s favorite  favorite whisky and made a toast to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
“So what names do you like?” Red Natalia asked<br />
<br />
“I don’t know...how about Alexandra?” Blue Natalia retorted<br />
<br />
“I like the sound of that Alexandra.. Hi Natalia I am Alexandra Berryman”  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you... you look amazing in that red dress Alexandra&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot;<br />
<br />
“So Alexandra what should we do now?”<br />
<br />
“We need some tech upgrades. That computer system I saw is outdated. Gomez had an associate in Argentina that works with cartels who has access to top level parts. With Gomez’s knowledge I can build a system that can gather intelligence much faster”<br />
<br />
“Argentina that sounds lovely Alexandra. I love the wine.”<br />
<br />
“I know it’s amazing then assassinating that drug lord from Japan was icing on top”<br />
<br />
“I wish you were there”<br />
<br />
“Well in a way I was”<br />
<br />
Alexandra and Natalia talked about their plans for the future of the bloodletters. Natalia got to experience first hand how her targets feel on seduction missions. She couldn’t take her eyes of Alexandra, her alluring personality and sexy body made Natalia lust for her. Alexandra felt the same way. There was something so sexy about having a clone of herself. They decided to check in to a nearby hotel.<br />
<br />
Once in there room they both said<br />
“I love you”<br />
That was it they needed to make love right now. Natalia told Alexandra to sit down on the bed. Natalia put on a little show for Alexandra letting her dark mane flow free taking off her dress then her bra letting her breasts fly free, then finally she removed her panties. She was naked and the moonlight made her look like the angel no goddess she was. Alexandra followed her twin in suit. They looked into each other’s identical eyes and were just lost. They kissed tenderly. They took ice cubes from the mini bar and rubbed them against their naked bodies. Soon Alexandra was eating Natalia&#39;s pussy but with more of a gentle calm movement of her tongue as opposed to the hard fucking she gave on the island. Natalia orgasmed five times. She then returned the favor in kind. Natalia and Alexandra with their super solider levels of power kept making love for 48 hours with no breaks. <br />
<br />
Exhausted they both let out a final I love you before dozing to sleep. Natalia and Alexandra returned to their work the following day with a renewed vigor. They had a contest to see who could kill more of Gomez’s old associates. Alexandra won the contest. The bloodletters got a massive tech upgrade due to Alexandra&#39;s technical expertise. Gomez’s love for technology and engineering lingered in Alexandra though it was much more sexual than before. It wasn’t uncommon to see her use gadgets as sex toys. Their superhuman levels of power made them unstoppable killing machines. For seduction missions where they couldn’t be together Natalia and Alexandra made sure to set up a cam for the other to watch later. For certain targets they made sure to keep a vile of blood reserved for the other to consume later. They also had many “special combat training sessions” whenever at HQ.</p>
