<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I hid behind the dish soap while Penny went to answer it.  It turns out that I needn’t have bothered since it was Brandon again.  <br />
<br />
“Just came over to see if Adam was here,” he said, looking around.  Penny told him that I wasn’t there, but he apparently saw the medallion in her hand and called out, “ Ah Ha!”  <br />
<br />
Running around, Brandon kept calling out, “Adam, where are you?  What has she done to you this time?”  <br />
<br />
He laughed while he did so.  Sighing I knew that I couldn’t hide forever so I came out and flew over to him, catching him by surprise when I landed on the coffee table in front of him.  “Damn Adam, that is so weird.”  He shook his head, still grinning.<br />
<br />
“Well I’d rather be bigger,” I told him, definitely having gotten tired of being so small.  “You wouldn’t believe how annoying this is.”<br />
<br />
“And I can barely see your lovely body”  Brandon told me smirking.  I stuck my tongue at him.  <br />
<br />
“Well I think I can fix that,” he continued, taking the medallion out of Penny’s hands.  She didn’t resist, obviously curious about what Brandon intended.  I had to admit that I was too, though at the same time I was half dreading it.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately I could feel my wings starting to shrink on me, while almost immediately I felt myself starting to get larger, though not unexpectedly I didn’t change from being a girl.  I continued to rapidly grow, hopping off the coffee table once I was large enough, and watching with satisfaction as Penny’s knee cap came up to my eye level, then quickly went below.  Soon I was about the same height I had started from, but oddly enough I didn’t stop growing.  Quickly I grew tall enough that I was looking down to see Brandon’s eyes, which is something that I’d never been able to do before.  And still I grew.  My head brushed the ceiling and I had to start hunching over.<br />
<br />
“That is amazing,” Penny said, her mouth open in surprise, and when I looked at Brandon, he looked very impressed as well.  And I still hadn’t finished growing.  The room started getting cramped on me and finally I stopped, guessing that I must be about 20 feet tall.  Man I wished that I could stand up and get a real feel for what it was like being huge.  But as it was I was only really cramped and unable to move much.  Penny looked impressed while Brandon looked like he was having a good time himself.  The bulge in front of his pants was the  most obvious sign of this.<br />
<br />
“Um guys..”  I started, “I don’t mind being a little taller, but this is going a little far.”<br />
<br />
Brandon grinned.  “I don’t know about that,” he told me, reaching up and holding one of my massive breasts against his hand.  I was too stuck to even be able to move away and he quickly ran a hand over to my hunched over ass and pinched that.  “You look about the right size to me.  Large enough to see clearly, and unable to run.”  He laughed some more but stopped when Penny slugged him.  “All right already,” he said, concentrating again.<br />
<br />
I sighed in relief as I started shrinking back down.  At least I could start moving again.  Quickly I had reached a point where my head was no longer brushing against the ceiling, which let me breath out a sigh of relief.  Being so much larger than Brandon and Penny had been kind of interesting, but I was too trapped to be able to enjoy it.  Suddenly I stopped shrinking, realizing immediately that I still wasn’t back to normal height.  I stood about 7 feet tall still.  <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” I asked nervously.<br />
<br />
“Oh nothing,” Brandon said, staring at me in awe.  He looked a little embarrassed, saying, “I like big women.”   <br />
<br />
With that he focused on the medallion again and I could feel my body changing once again.  This time however it was my muscles.  I stared amazed as my muscles swelled in size, bulging out while my breasts started growing again as well. Finally I stopped, still a female but definitely not small and weak.<br />
<br />
“Amazing,” Penny said, staring at me with her mouth dropped open.  I grinned and looked down at her, then turned and looked down at Brandon who still looked small compared to me.  Especially since my muscles were so huge as well.<br />
<br />
“Well, what do you think?” I asked them as I flexed my biceps, amazed at the bulge of muscle.  I was bigger than even some woman body builder.  No woman could get as big as Brandon had made me, and especially not while retaining the very sexy figure that I obviously still had.  I had to admit it, I was impressed.  And what was more, I loved the feeling of raw strength that I was feeling.  I felt so powerful.  Just to prove to myself how strong I was, I reached over and picked Brandon up, amazed at just how light he seemed to me.  Laughing with excitement I set him back down and started examining my newest body, suitably impressed.  I noticed that not only was Brandon obviously horny, but Penny was absently rubbing her tits.<br />
<br />
Shaking my head, I picked Penny up and gave her a deep kiss, which made her hesitate for a second, apparently not comfortable with kissing someone who looked like a woman, but she quickly started to respond.  <br />
<br />
“Where’s mine?” Brandon demanded.  Just to be perverse, I bent over and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek as well, laughing at the look of embarrassment on his face.<br />
<br />
Looking back at Penny I grinned, and reached over to take the medallion away from Brandon.  <br />
<br />
“Sorry Brandon,” I told him, glancing quickly at Penny, “but Penny and I need some time alone.” <br />
<br />
 With a disappointed look on his face Brandon reluctantly turned and left, promising that he wanted to hear all about it later on.  Still grinning I picked Penny up and carried her to the bed, the medallion still clutched in my hand.  That thing definitely had some possibilities.</p>
