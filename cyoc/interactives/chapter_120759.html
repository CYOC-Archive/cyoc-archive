<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite that the sun was only just starting to set; Peter wasn’t wasting any time to enjoy a chance to be with Helen. The two in his room and writhing on his bed; Peter a were-lion was busy making Helen a were-rabbit mewl in joy as the barbed penis in her twitched and flared. For Peter this was rare opportunity to annoy his younger sister Jean. Growing up and having to put up with her tricks and tormenting that an older brother had to suffer through; Peter was relishing the fact that he and Helen were rutting while Jean was being denied the carnal pleasure with her mate.<br />
<br />
While Peter did feel a pang of sympathy for Nate; being assaulted by a couple of were-panthers the prior evening. An attack that rendered the young were-wolf unable to shift into his fursona thanks to some damage to his inner ear; Peter couldn’t help but roar in delight as it stymied Jean and her desire to be mated and filled.<br />
<br />
Returning his thoughts back to the matter at hand; Peter looked at his were-rabbit mate as he was busy thrusting deeper into her. Gazing on her soft grey and white fur; the long furry ears flopping about and seeing Helen’s furry face twist and contort in pure pleasure. Lowering his leonine muzzle to hers, Peter lets his tongue out; planting a large kiss on her as Helen sighs; Her paws wrapped around Peter’s furry back, the small dull claws digging in as her body shudders with another mirco-orgasm.<br />
<br />
Rumbling with pleasure, Peter doubles his efforts; picking up the pace as he raises his head prepared to roar in triumph. The feeling of his furry balls clenching and churning while flapping wildly about, signaled that his moment was about to come. Gritting his teeth and uttering a low growl; Peter makes on final powerful thrust deeper into Helen’s slick sex just as he explodes.<br />
<br />
Hearing Helen scream and squeal; her body shuddering as he paints her womb with his seed, Peter lets loose a mighty roar that shakes the house down to its very foundations. Panting with his tongue lolled out; Peter looks down to see Helen smiling and sighing. Her tiny pink nose twitching with each breath she takes as Helen tightens her grip. Peter taking this as his cue moves his powerful arms to underneath Helen, wrapping her in a tight yet loving embrace as he rolls them both to their side; their gazes still locked upon each other.<br />
<br />
“If I didn’t know better,” Helen still enjoying the afterglow; “you were trying to get me pregnant.”<br />
“You don’t want my cub in you,” Peter feeling the last of his seed spurting out of him.<br />
“No,” Helen sighing before adding; “at least not right now. Just because we had a were-wedding a few days ago,” Helen snugging more into Peter; “doesn’t mean we should rush things so quickly. You’re still in college and recovering from a gunshot wound…”<br />
“Recovering quickly thanks to you;” Peter interrupting and smiling through his leonine muzzle.<br />
“That’s because I’m a doctor,” Helen answering; “it’s part of my job.”<br />
“And I won’t be in college forever,” Peter speaking; “despite not having my business degree, I already have two clients. My dad’s restoration shop and oddly enough Anderson landscaping,” Peter kissing Helen on the nose; “and that’s not counting that one day I’ll be king of the were-lion pride.”<br />
“Let’s discuss making a family tomorrow then,” Helen yawning; “you rutted me into exhaustion and I just want to sleep with you as my blanket and pillow.”<br />
“Roar,” Peter rumbles as he observes Helen relaxing her grip on him as she does her best to curl up next to him; despite being tightly embraced to each other. Peter rolls over so he is on his back, allowing Helen to sleep stomach side down on top of him; her head resting on his furry chest, her head bobbing up and down as Peter’s lungs inhales and exhales.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
In the room next to Peter’s; Jean heard and felt Peter’s powerful ministrations to his were-rabbit. The rocking and creaking of his bed shaking the wall dividing their rooms; Jean knew Peter was doing it on purpose, making sure to mate with his companion in such a way so as to get under her fur. It worked as she growled in anger; not liking the fact that her older brother is getting one up on her. Jean was fuming that Nate who she was currently digging her claws into as he laid next to her was not in his fursona, while she was.<br />
<br />
“Can you stop digging your claws in me,” Nate groaning; “and just snuggle with me.”<br />
“You listen to your sibling rut while not being able to do the same with your mate,” Jean responds.<br />
“Been there done that,” Nate answering; “you remember my brother Eric, the were-panther with two girlfriends?”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Jean digging her claws into Nate deeper as she hears her older brother roar.<br />
“Your claws again,” Nate wincing; “they are digging into my back again.”<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry,” Jean releasing her grip as Nate gets up. Watching her werewolf mate stand up, she notices the deep furrows into his back, the blood dripping from them as he tries to see how bad the damage is.<br />
“They’ll heal,” Jean getting up and grabbing a towel to help staunch the bleeding.<br />
“It’s a good thing I’m already a were,” Nate chuckling; “those caws of yours would of made me into a were-lion if I was still a normal.”<br />
“And that would be a bad thing,” Jean asking as she embraced Nate from behind as she looks at his naked human form in the mirror over her room’s door. &quot;Tawny fur all over your body,” Jean rubbing her paws all along Nate’s chest; “a large mane of reddish orange fur encircling your head as your muzzle lets loose a proud roar of dominance.”<br />
“With a tail as graceful as yours,” Nate turning around; “ending in a tuft of that same reddish orange fur. Are you trying to bait me to shift into my werewolf fursona,” Nate smiles; “setting back my recovery?”<br />
“Is it working,” Jean rumbling; her muzzle’s nose pressed up onto Nate’s, giving him a quick affectionate lick.<br />
<br />
“Oh I’m tempted,” Nate feeling his arousal build; “nothing would make me happier than to let my wolf out and claim you right here and now.”<br />
“You know I like to struggle to be on top,” Jean letting a paw trail to Nate’s swelling member.<br />
OH I know,” Nate gasping as he feels Jean’s think leathery pads stroking his shaft. “Please stop,” Nate gasping; “we’ll… have… our moment.”<br />
“I’m not sure I can wait a week,” Jean pouting; “this kitty needs to get off.”<br />
“You can always give Liv Robinson a call,” Nate walking back to bed; “pretty sure that were-leopard will be more than happy to jump your bones.”<br />
“Oh,” Jean lighting up as she join her mate to bed; “I haven’t sampled her honey in months.”<br />
“Just be sure to let me know when you two go at it,” Nate grinning; “I wouldn’t mind a show while I recover from my inner ear damage.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Down in the living room; Leon and Regina were watching television; watching the news which mostly comprised of Frederick Parker and his near death at the hands of an assassin. The same Assassin the local police along with the FBI are currently scouring the town for. The sound of police sirens blaring in the distance was not lost upon the two were-lions as they listened thanks to the enhanced were-hearing. The sound of a bed creaking was also not lost upon them. Knowing that their son Peter was busy rutting his were-rabbit mate; they went back to watching the news; Looking up and then at each other as they hear Peter’s roar. Leon and Regina chuckle as that same roar causes the whole house to shake.<br />
<br />
Both thankful that Helen’s twin brother Andy left soon after dinner; the two were-lions could only imagine what the male were-rabbit paramedic would do if he heard Peter’s mighty roar.<br />
“It’s been a while since you roared like that,” Regina glancing at her husband; “announcing to the world of your conquest and daring those to challenge you.”<br />
“Give it time,” Leon eliciting a wry smile; “the pride meeting is coming up in about a month.”<br />
“What if I don’t want to wait then,” Regina looking at Leon lustfully; “what if I want you to roar like our son just did?”<br />
“Well for starters,” Leon smirking; “we are still under a were-alert. A roar such as the one Peter just made tends to attract those not familiar with our town. With the reporters running around our town,” Leon removing Regina’s paw from his crotch; “multiple roars even coming from inside a house is something we need to discourage for the time being. But that doesn’t mean I won’t make you feel whole and complete,” Leon rumbling softly as his feline member stands tall and proud out of his sheathe; &quot;we just need to keep the roaring to a minimum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina elicits a rumble of delight as she grabs the remote to the television; turning off the device. No longer interested in what was currently happening live outside their door; Regina just shoved the coffee table out of the way as she crawled onto the floor on her paws and knees.<br />
“Claim me my king,” Regina growling; flicking her tail out of the way, displaying her dripping sex to Leon.<br />
“I’ll do that and more,” Leon wasting no time to give Regina what she desired as he effortlessly leapt of the sofa and mounted his wife; ready and eager to rut Regina to her hearts content.</p>
