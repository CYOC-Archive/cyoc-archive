<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes, I see... I will. Not a problem. I just need to finish up here and definitely good news to hear! Please, send a vehicle to the address where I am at and we will fix things.&quot; Officer Ramirez said, answering his phone in front of everyone, ending the call and texting the address for Nate&#39;s house to his contact. &quot;So... that was a contact of mine that has been working on an antidote for the effects of the Lunar Ecstasy and he believes he has come up with something that will solve everyone&#39;s problems. All of you don&#39;t want to remain like this, do you?&quot; Officer Ramirez finally asked.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked around at one another, shaking their heads and exclaiming no adamantly except for Nate. Nate didn&#39;t respond nor did he make a bodily gesture, he just stood there, unsure of what to make of things and really didn&#39;t know what to do or say. Nate loved being a werewolf. He loved the idea of being one permanently, wishing he could keep his lupine features like his tipped ears, sharper teeth, more muscular body and increased hair coverage. He couldn&#39;t help thinking to himself just how boring and plain being a human was now that he got to experience something more... something beyond human. What Nate didn&#39;t realize was that Officer Ramirez was taking full notice of everything Nate was or wasn&#39;t doing or saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, everyone just wait in the living room for me... except you Nate... we need to have a bit longer of a chat...&quot; Officer Ramirez directed as everyone but Nate did as instructed. &quot;The vehicle I sent for is on its way and we will take you all for the antidote!&quot; He said with the others chatting and murmuring in excitement.<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s left eyebrow raised and his right lowered in curious confusion, not really sure what was going on with Officer Ramirez, but did as was instructed. Silently, Officer Ramirez pointed toward Nate&#39;s room upstairs and knew that the cop wanted to go up there for their private conversation. Nate didn&#39;t mind really because it would allow him to see Nate&#39;s love and affinity for werewolves and just how much he wished he could be a werewolf permanently and indefinitely. As they walked upstairs to his room, side by side, Nate went to start asking questions, but Officer Ramirez put a single finger to Nate&#39;s lips to quiet him for the time being. Taking the hint, knowing nothing could be said until they were in Nate&#39;s room, Nate remained silent and walked into his bedroom with Officer Ramirez trailing closely behind. As Nate stood in the middle of his room, his back turned toward the computer setup where a screensaver was playing with tons of pictures of werewolves or a single man turning into a werewolf through a series of pictures he discovered or had commissioned in the first place and Officer Ramirez grinned as he saw everything. Looking around the room, standing in the slight &quot;corridor&quot; in the bedroom from the built-in closet in Nate&#39;s room, he noticed hundreds of werewolf oriented items nicely and carefully placed around his room to decorate it the way Nate liked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you really love werewolves huh and the other night when you were a werewolf... I bet you loved the thrill of it, didn&#39;t you?&quot; The officer asked, slowly, but aggressively approaching Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sir... I do and I definitely did! Feeling the transformation, feeling free and just running through the woods like the furry, clawed and fanged beast that I was... it was invigorating and thrilling!&quot; Nate said with a huge, beaming smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Hearing the answer and seeing the look on his face, Officer Ramirez simply grinned, but then continued his approach with a dominant and aggressive stance. When Ramirez was chest to chest to Nate, he aggressively grabbed Nate by the collar, balling the shirt up in his one hand and yanked him to look Ramirez in the eyes. &quot;Then why did you have to go and fuck things up you little shit?! Do you think you obtained Lunar Ecstasy just because?&quot; He said as his eyes took on a sinister crimson glow. &quot;The answer is No... No the fuck you didn&#39;t. You, and several others we have been watching, were going to be given Lunar and we&#39;d see if you all were worthy of becoming one with the pack, but you were the first chosen and you fucked things up! What the fuck were you thinking leaving the Lunar out for any one person to come in here and find?&quot; Officer Ramirez&#39;s body started bulking up, pressing his uniform firmly against his changing body. &quot;We only intended on YOU getting it because we knew you&#39;d become a werewolf from taking it... that was the whole fucking point! No one else was supposed to get their hands on it and the dealer who sold it to you knew that. He wasn&#39;t going to dole any out to anyone that wasn&#39;t vetted and approved to go onto what we call &#39;Stage One&#39;.&quot; Ramirez said, his body heaving, his breath huffing as he was trying to control himself.<br />
<br />
Right then and there, several things were revealed to Nate in that very short moment. Not only was Ramirez in on the drug being sold, but he was potentially behind it. In fact, Nate thought that Ramirez was on it himself and that&#39;s why Ramirez was showing signs of transforming into a werewolf right then and there, but he also knew Ramirez had enough forethought that he was controlling it or otherwise his disappearance in the house would be awkward to explain away and his uniform would be destroyed... so he&#39;d have nothing to wear when it came time to deal with the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you a dealer or the Master behind all of this? I am guessing you only intended for werewolves to be made from taking Lunar Ecstasy... hence the name? I am also guessing you knew that others could end up being something else entirely, but weren&#39;t sure what it would do and didn&#39;t want an experiment to run wild?&quot; Nate postulated in front of Officer Ramirez.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good... you do catch on quick!&quot; Officer Ramirez said with a snide sneer. &quot;I am, indeed, the Master. I am the Alpha of a very ancient pack of werewolves that have long awaited a time for our return and with what we have seen in the uptick in desire for more werewolf content in the media... we knew it was our time to emerge. However, we aren&#39;t the cute, cuddly, fluffy little fuckin&#39; things you see more and more. No! We are true monsters that thrive on brutality, viscera and what it truly means to be monsters. Stage One, what you experienced, was only a taste in what lycanthropy has to offer. We needed to see how you would respond and take to it. Thankfully... you responded exactly how we wanted and we watched you carefully as you went about your business being a werewolf. We saw the thrill of it in your eyes, how you loved being what you were and how there was a longing for more. Do you know what that longing was Nate? Do you know what was missing?&quot; Officer Ramirez asked as he breathed hotly onto Nate&#39;s face, which turned him on and caused a chub to develop in his pants... a chub that was pressing against Ramirez&#39;s own impressively thick bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I am guessing the monstrous quality?&quot; Nate asked, uncertain of things. He could remember being the werewolf, being free, but also a deep longing for more. He could sense that there was more to being a werewolf in that instance, but it didn&#39;t come to him. However, in that time, Nate ran through the woods, enjoying the freedom and when he felt hungry... he hunted down a deer deep in the woods and fed on the carcass like a proper wolf would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet again, you are correct my boy! The Monster is what we call &#39;Stage Two&#39; and that... I will admit... is THE most fun part about being a werewolf. Unleashing your true potential, your deepest desires and eliminating the bane of what humans are... their humanity. No longer caring for the ways of this world and living truly in the ways of the wolf. So... now I have a major dilemma on my paws, as it were... what to do with the rest of your people downstairs. We can&#39;t have any other anthros running around, now can we?&quot; Ramirez said with an evil sneer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I suppose you and your pack can&#39;t have any loose ends.&quot; Nate said, slightly fearful for his brother and the rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right again you are! Now... to fix this fuckin&#39; mess of yours... there&#39;s a few options at hand. The first is that I turn, right here and now, and just slaughter the entirety of you all. I have eliminated threats bigger and stronger than you and know that my methods are quite thorough for it to never get pinned on me or any of my pack. If I need to disappear... well... I transform with my clothes on and the remnants look like a mauling from a wild animal and I just move on with my pack elsewhere and start a new life with the help of my packmates in the government who can fake every document needed to prove my identity. If I don&#39;t need to disappear... well... I take my identifying clothes off before changing so I have at least that to wear once I walk out of wherever. The second option is that I give you Lunar Monster, allowing you to transform right here and now, embracing the monster and to take care of your loose ends. The third option, we do it together and I show you what it&#39;s like to truly embrace the monster... though killing everyone in the house that isn&#39;t a werewolf like us... which means your mom, dad and brother... definitely shows how you truly do embrace the beast within. The fourth and fifth options are like option two and three, but at my compound where covering up their disappearances would be somewhat easier. I personally wish to indulge in option two or three, just doing things here and getting it over with, but I am leaving the choice up to you... for now. You have great potential as a true werewolf Nate... don&#39;t squander this opportunity.&quot; Officer Ramirez said, laying out everything and giving Nate little choice in the matter, letting go of Nate&#39;s shirt and let him stand there with a bit of dignity.<br />
<br />
Either Nate was going to die along with his family, friends and others... or he was going to become the monster he always wanted to be... just with a heavy cost. The idea was weighing heavily on his mind and as Ramirez mentioned, his humanity was keeping him weighed down. He didn&#39;t know how he could live with slaughtering them all, but if he was a monster... would he really even care? Would it even bother him? The desire to be a monster, a monstrous werewolf at that, was thrilling and everything he ever wanted. Knowing he couldn&#39;t make the decision because the weight of such a decision was too much for him to bear, Nate decided to leave it up to the Master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master...&quot; Nate said, which told Officer Ramirez Nate decided to live, at the very least. &quot;... I wish for you to decide. I can&#39;t. It&#39;s my family and my friends down there. Though I want to be a monster, I am not one yet and therefore I can&#39;t make this call.&quot; Nate truthfully answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this isn&#39;t surprising to be honest Nate, but to be a true monster... this has to be your decision. However, I do have something else my chemists have worked up.&quot; He said with a grin that was truly monstrous as his fangs were showing at this point while a thick beard was adorning his face from holding back the wolf, but letting it out just enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what is it?&quot; Nate asked as he was uncertain of what Ramirez was getting at.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s called Lunar Slave. You take this and you become mine... in every way, shape and form. You take this and it will remove your inhibitions and open you to pure desire. It&#39;s a powder and you snort it, but its effects are nearly instant. The wolf will emerge out of you, but you&#39;ll also be forever bound to do as I wanted to you to... which also means making a decision toward what happens with your family and friends. Taking this... you will want to do everything in your power to please me, regardless of what it means for you. If you don&#39;t take this and you refuse to make a decision without taking Lunar Monster first... I will make the decision for you and slaughter them all.&quot; He said, holding out a baggie of light blue looking powder in one hand and the hand that once held Nate in place had a light red looking powder that must&#39;ve been the Lunar Monster.<br />
<br />
Nate looked at the two packages, thinking things over, debating if he just wanted to dive head first and take the Lunar Monster, becoming a werewolf monster, hell bent on doing whatever he wanted while also always obeying Ramirez or if he wanted to take Lunar Slave first and throw everything he was to be Ramirez&#39;s slave with a desire to always please and pleasure the Master any way he possibly could. Both ideas were arousing and sounded fun, but Nate also knew that he wasn&#39;t capable of being a true monster... not without a little push... which is just what Lunar Slave offered. Reaching out, Nate took the blue packet of powder into his hand. &quot;Wh-what do I do?&quot; Nate asked, uncertain how to take such things.<br />
<br />
Ramirez grinned, &quot;Open the bag just enough to allow your nostril to get good suction on the powder, close your other nostril with your finger and breathe in through your nose. Whatever you don&#39;t get with the first bit, switch nostrils and take the rest. You need all of the bulk for the full effect!&quot; Ramirez said with a bit of a commanding tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... yes Sir...&quot; Nate said, opening the baggie as was instructed, just enough to have it open and get a good seal to inhale most of it.<br />
<br />
Taking in a very deep breath through his right nostril, the bag shriveled up against his flesh and the majority of the powder was inhaled on the first round. As Nate looked to Ramirez through different eyes... the eyes of a slave who would do anything commanded to serve him and give him pleasure, Ramirez smiled and nodded, silently instructing Nate to take the remainder. Quickly, Nate switched nostrils and breathed in the rest of the bulk with only a small amount of residue remaining, just a light dusting that coated the plastic baggie. Immediately a lustful haze washed over his mind and his body, causing him to drop the baggie as he felt like a little puppy needing accolades for doing a good job and being a good boy. Looking up at his Master, Nate&#39;s eyes had the pleading look of need and Ramirez grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is a good new werewolf for your Master... eh?&quot; Ramirez said, petting Nate&#39;s head, fiddling behind his ears, then cupping his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Master!&quot; Nate said obediently, looking up, not even noticing what Ramirez was about to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why don&#39;t you be a good slave for me first? Take out my dick and place the head in your mouth. Master has a special treat to share with you.&quot; Ramirez instructed and just like he was told, Nate dutifully unzipped the trousers and fished out his Master&#39;s thick cock, sticking just the head in his mouth, the edge of the crown just past the interior edge of his lips so that he got a good seal around it for what came next. &quot;Good boy, now just relax and drink...&quot; Ramirez said before releasing his bladder into Nate&#39;s otherwise empty mouth as his golden fluid rushed in and Nate dutifully swallowed, drinking it down, just as he was instructed. &quot;Good boy! Very good boy!&quot; Ramirez cooed as he continued to drain his bladder into his slave, impressed by how well he took his piss for what Ramirez suspected would have been the very first time. &quot;Open... I am about finished, but I need others to know who you belong to!&quot; He said with a coy grin as Nate obeyed. With the stream still flowing somewhat strong, Ramirez aimed his cock to go over Nate&#39;s head, showering his head of hair and his back with his piss, soaking his clothes. &quot;Now... present!&quot; He commanded and somehow Nate knew what that meant, proudly bearing his chest and full front side, which Ramirez pissed all over, soaking him in front as well, claiming all of Nate as property that belonged to him. Feeling the emptiness of his bladder returned, Ramirez moaned in pleasure. &quot;Now... while my piss is claiming you on the inside and the wolf is going to emerge as my property... you better suck me off so we can be in a good mindset for our upcoming meal! We can&#39;t let all that meat go to waste, now can we?&quot; He asked with his sinister tone returning.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Master... we can&#39;t...&quot; Nate said almost autonomously, his old self completely gone and given way to what he was now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear it pup, but before we go for our feast... what do you think... should I just turn in my uniform and we start fresh somewhere new or take off my uniform and transform in my underwear. No less arousing I think, but a monster emerging from a cop&#39;s uniform just has a very sexy ring to it... wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot; Ramirez said as Nate just nodded, which made Ramirez remember one key element, &quot;You&#39;re still going to need this Lunar Monster though to embrace the creature we are at our core and no... it won&#39;t make you any less of my slave... just adds that all important monster quality to you.&quot; He added watching as Nate&#39;s ears became more pointed, his eyes glowed an ominous and eerie yellowed amber while the teeth in his mouth sharpened to be more fang-like and his fingernails started ripping up as his claws started pushing up from the beds of Nate&#39;s once human keratin.</p>
