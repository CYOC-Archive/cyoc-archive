<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liz arrived back at Maureen’s house and after looking through some of the brochures she had taken, ran a bath and proceeded to once more, trim her pubic hairs. At least this time there was no need to shave her legs. She trimmed her pubes to the same pattern she had when in her previous Maureen incarnation. She would give her current body back to Maureen in better condition than she had received it in.<br />
<br />
She then used her remaining time alone to go through Maureen’s make up and accessories deciding what would enhance the outfit she and Maureen had decided would be worn to the theatre. Lastly she took pleasure in cleaning up the house. Usually she detested cleaning but somehow having a husband who would be home soon gave her incentive to iron and rehang Roger’s shirts in his wardrobe then tidy his underwear drawers. She had just finished vacuuming when she heard a car pull up in the garage.<br />
…………<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the guys returned from the walk along the beach and Maureen was invited back to their units to have a shower. Maureen decided that that sounded preferable to using the public showers which were rather run down. The students were staying in adjacent two bedroom units in a complex just across the road from where she had found them. <br />
<br />
Crossing the road she couldn’t take her eyes off Sean who was walking in front of her. She decided he was the best looking of the guy’s. He was clad only in board shorts and had an athletic figure with noticeable but not overly large muscles. He really did remind Maureen of the photos of Roger she had seen when her husband was Sean’s age. She had not met Roger until he was 27. She decided Sean had a really cute bum.<br />
<br />
Maureen had a shower in the girl’s room with Charlotte allowing her to use her shampoo. She then dressed in Liz’s skirt and top that she had worn earlier. She found most of the others in the lounge in the adjacent boy’s unit enjoying some beers and snacks. Claire had proceeded into the shower once she had left and she assumed Mason was in the other shower. <br />
<br />
Steve and Kirsty were sitting on one couch with Steve’s arm around the girl’s shoulder. Sean was sitting on another two seater on his own while Charlotte was sitting alone on a third two seater. Cameron was in the kitchen and asked “Will you stay for a drink Maureen?”<br />
<br />
Maureen thought it was only polite as she had just used their shower “One drink won’t do me any harm”<br />
<br />
“Take a seat then. What would you like? We have beer or beer”<br />
<br />
“I think I’d like a beer” Maureen was curious about Kirsty’s tastebuds. In her own body she did not particularly like beer but she knew Kirsty did. Maureen’s next dilemma was which seat to take. Should she take the seat beside Charlotte or the one beside Sean? There were no other vacant seats in the room. She guessed from the empty beer bottle on the table that Cameron had been sitting next to Sean.<br />
<br />
She recalled Charlotte was keen on Cameron. Charlotte had allowed her to use her shampoo and conditioner. She should return the favour. If she took the seat beside Sean then Cameron would have no choice but to sit next to Charlotte. She decided that little prompts like that might make the budding romance blossom. She gave Charlotte a wink and sat beside Sean. <br />
<br />
Sean seemed shocked and surprised that the new girl had sat beside him. He had thought she was out of his league. While she had been showering Kirsty had told them that Maureen had a boyfriend back home. This was unexpected. The girl could have sat on the vacant seat beside Charlotte but instead had sat next to him! Was this suggesting she was keen on him? She was a cutie and he heard that nurses liked to be hands on. He sat up straighter aware that his penis had come to life and that he was still just in his board shorts. <br />
<br />
Cameron returned with three beers. He passed one each to Sean and Maureen then took the only remaining seat, the one next to Charlotte. From Charlotte’s body language it was so evident to Maureen that she was keen on Cameron. Maureen felt she had made the right decision.<br />
<br />
The others were discussing what they were going to do for the evening. Kirsty was leading the discussion. She was keen to go out to some club they had spotted the previous night just down the road. Maureen had quickly garnered that Kirsty was the leader of the girls. Likewise Steve seemed to be the organiser amongst the guys. Quickly the others agreed to Kirsty’s wishes.<br />
  <br />
Some chips were on the table in front of Sean. He passed the bowl to Maureen “Like some?” <br />
<br />
“Why thank-you” she replied and took a handful. <br />
<br />
Mason appeared from the boy’s bathroom with only a towel around his waist. He called out “Showers free”<br />
 <br />
Sean quickly stood up and said “I’ll take it”. Maureen couldn’t help but observe the bulge in his board shorts. Sean appeared to have some sort of asset inside. She averted her eyes and pretended not to notice. Sean fled the room while Steve informed Mason that they were going clubbing.<br />
<br />
Mason said “Sounds great. I’ll get dressed” then disappeared once more. Soon Claire appeared and Kirsty informed her of what was happening for the evening. She was just in a beach shift but had obviously just showered. She replied “I’ll start getting myself ready in that case”<br />
<br />
Kirsty then left to have her own shower. <br />
<br />
When Steve went to have the next shower only Cameron, Charlotte and Maureen were left. Cameron passed Maureen another beer, her third. She had not even realised she had finished the second one. It had gone down well. Her current taste buds had enjoyed the flavour. She accepted. Cameron once more sat down beside Charlotte, even though there were now plenty of other vacant seats. Maureen was by now convinced that the attraction between her two companions was mutual. She decided it was time to progress things along.<br />
<br />
She pretended to innocently ask “Are you two an item?” <br />
<br />
Cameron visibly flushed. “Err. No actually”<br />
<br />
“Why not? It’s obvious you are keen on each other”<br />
<br />
This appeared to be a revelation to Cameron. He glanced at Charlotte. She replied with a sweet smile and said “We could be”<br />
<br />
“Ah…. Uh“.  Cameron was at a loss for words. <br />
<br />
Maureen chimed in “Now’s the moment Cameron. Ask her out. She won’t say no”<br />
<br />
Cameron was still looking at Charlotte’s face. She was still smiling at him. He shyly asked “Charlotte, will you go out with me?”<br />
<br />
She quickly replied “I’d love to” and gave him a peck on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Just then Steve called out “Showers free” An embarrassed Cameron left the room.</p>
