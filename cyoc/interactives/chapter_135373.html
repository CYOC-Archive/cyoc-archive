<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was early when Mary woke up. She couldn&#39;t sleep, she kept thinking about Damien and her joeys. To her, she was a mile away from home, but she had to be to keep this job. Honestly, if she didn&#39;t worry about the job, she would continuously just worry about her family. She moved her body into a sitting position, and rubbed her eyes, trying to remove the tiredness from her face. She put her paws under her muzzle, staring at the light blue walls of her prison-like room. Her eyes darted about as thoughts of her mother, her father, her family and her future seeped into her mind, making her feel melancholy as she wiped her paws upon her face. <br />
&quot;I might as well get ready, I&#39;m up anyway&quot; Mary said to herself. She hopped off the bed, slightly unbalanced as she stood up, still tired. Upon the closed door of her room was her uniform or, at least, most of it. A white nurse&#39;s jacket hanged on a door hook. She rubbed her left eye, still trying to remove the sleep and tiredness from her face. She walked over to it and grabbed it off the hook. It was a regular nurse&#39;s jacket, with some additions to it. There was a hole at the back for her tail, with some extra padding around the hole for comfort. &quot;That&#39;s nice... really convenient...&quot; Mary said to herself as she observed the jacket. Thoughts of her mother started to enter her mind. She hadn&#39;t called her mother for a long while. Her mother hadn&#39;t called her as well. She didn&#39;t want her mother to worry, she couldn&#39;t let her worry since her husband passed away. Mary supported her mother throughout the years, throughout most of her life, the thought alone of not checking in on her worried Mary dearly, who knows what could happen to her mother when she didn&#39;t call. Mary shook those thoughts away for the moment and focused on the jacket. She tried it on. It seemed to fit her comfortably, no tightness, no bagginess, it almost felt like it was perfectly made for her. Even fitting her tail into the jacket was easy. Yet something didn&#39;t sit right with Mary. There was something else in the jacket that she felt. Something in the front pocket. She reached into the front pocket, felt something and pulled it out. A hat. A little nurse&#39;s hat. Mary began to smile, she thought it looked cute, so she decided to put it on and look at herself in the mirror. The sight of her in the nurse&#39;s uniform seemed to wash away her worries for the time being. She felt like she was here for a reason when she looked at the jacket, she felt even more like a professional, and she thought about how proud her mother and father would be if they could see her now. She grabbed the clipboard and pen, and continued to write in her new diary.<br />
<br />
James didn&#39;t know what time it was when he woke up. Trying to get rid of any evidence of Jess has now changed into Mary was extremely exhausting for him. He rubbed his neck as it was stinging due to him sleeping in a sitting down position. Rubbing his eyes, he slowly rose to check the photos. All the photos of Jess and her friends changed. Jess now looked like a younger Mary in every photo, while her friends looked like a slightly wimpy man and a fennec fox woman. James tried to smile but the tiredness and the realisation that he has to do more to keep up Mary&#39;s identity just made him sigh. He looked over to the several bags that were next to him and slowly reached for one. The closest near him was a small turquoise camp bag. He flimsily opened the bag, trying to find anything that would make Mary continue to believe the lies that created her identity. A toiletries bag filled with toothpaste, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, deodorant, some make-up, hand sanitizer, as well as a first-aid kit. It wasn&#39;t anything special, it was simple but he needed simple stuff right now. He opened the other zippers. Tissues, some magazines, clothes. He checked another bag, very similar items were inside. Another bag, more clothes, more magazines, more toiletries. Another bag... but this time, there was more, and he knew it was from Jess. Inside, there was more photos, some of her friends, some of her family and some of herself. This was perfect for James. This was more evidence. He checked around the bag to see if there was anything else. A diary, her driver&#39;s license, and a wallet with a picture of her family inside when she was young. The smile returned to James&#39; face. This was his saving grace. There was more in the bag, but he saved that for later. There was more work to do, more photos to change, more memories of Jess that he had to erase completely and more &quot;memories&quot; that he had to create for Mary. More memories, more drama, more lies, more of Jess being completely removed from her mind and more of her mind becoming Jess&#39;s. He loved every minute that he thought of this, more and more plans of what he is going to do made him felt more and more like a genius, creating the perfect &quot;weapon&quot; that he could do anything with. He started to laugh, growing with deviousness as it continued, filling the closed room of his office.<br />
<br />
Today was going to be a good day for Dr. James Delguard.</p>
