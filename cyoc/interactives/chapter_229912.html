<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rebecca put on a bigger fake smile, but internally cringed as she had to wrap her other arm around Rosita. She wiggled uncomfortably in place, feeling that her former lover unknowingly transformed into panties were giving her a wedgie. The four former college men turned older women gave big grins.<br />
&quot;Say cheese!&quot; Jennifer added, just before reality itself was about to be altered.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
The camera had been on random, and as such, each one of their transformations was up to chance. However, whenever people are changed together, the camera often makes their changes connected somehow, and in this instance, they went from work-friends, to family!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... ow... why does my head hurt?&quot;  Raoul mumbled, suddenly holding his head in pain.<br />
<br />
Raoul had gone through minimal changes, still being a young adult, still being Latino, but having gone through a gender change. No longer was Rosita the pear shaped Latina beauty, but instead she was Raoul, the fit, Latino hunk. He had short, but wavy dark hair, caramel colored skin and dark eyes. He was tall, muscular and surprisingly still had a pretty nice ass.<br />
<br />
He looked down and felt... off, and yet, somehow better than he felt before? Of course, with the camera leaving him unaware, he had no way of knowing he had gone from a college aged guy, to an older woman, to a man again the same age as that older lady. His mind, changing in such short succession had muddled his brain slightly. Reality changing so rapidly is gonna give anyone a headache.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was I... always wearing this flannel?&quot; He muttered aloud as the headache began to fade. However, his train of thought was derailed by the woman who stood beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey I-I think I&#39;m gonna be sick.&quot; She said with panicked breath.<br />
<br />
Raoul turned to see his frie- no, no, his wife! That was his lovely wife, Juanita! The former Jennifer had actually become somewhat younger, to match Raoul, with both of them being in their 30s rather than the former Jennifer&#39;s 40s. Likewise, her race had changed to better fit in with her brand-new hubby.<br />
<br />
Her hair was a darker hue, and straighter than before. Her skin was darker than Raoul&#39;s, with no blemish in sight. Her breasts were swollen, as was her ass, and the reason why was obvious. Juanita was very, obviously, pregnant. And inside her womb was another former adult, Keiko, now reduced to a 2nd trimester fetus.<br />
<br />
Raoul helped his wife over to a nearby garbage can, where fortunately Juanita was able to hold in the sickness. In reality, her sickness was simply caused by the sudden transformation of going from not pregnant to several months pregnant in an instant. Any doubts about this sudden reality shift like Raoul had were quickly squashed by her new, motherly instincts as love for her kids filled her heart.<br />
<br />
Kids was plural, of course, because the final two people in the photo had transformed as well. Emily had gone through the most drastic change, as she had transformed from a mindless pair of panties back into a human being. She was now a he, a boy named Emilio. He was about 5 years old, with jet black curly hair, darker skin like his new mother, and dressed in a Mickey Mouse clubhouse shirt with Velcro shoes and cheap shorts.<br />
<br />
Next to him was the former Rick, now younger again... though far too young. Rick was now a 3-year-old girl named Rosa, ironically taking on a name similar to Raoul&#39;s former name. She had curly black hair, an adorable smile, and was dressed in an Elsa dress she insists on wearing constantly. Despite her young age, however, she felt as if something was wrong.<br />
&quot;Emilio?&quot; She asked, looking up at her older brother. &quot;Why do I feel funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Rosa, you&#39;re probably jutht hungry.&quot; He said with a lisp before going back to kicking his feet back and forth as he sat on the large food court chair.<br />
<br />
Rosa listened to her brother, like always, and plopped down in the seat beside him. Just then, their parents walked back over, with Juanita holding her enlarged stomach carefully. Raoul helped her sit before sitting himself, then gave a smile to his kids. <br />
&quot;Come on niños, let&#39;s eat our meal now that Mamí is feeling better.&quot; He said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Rosa then saw that there was in fact food on the table, with some McDonald kiddie meals lying in front of her. She felt weird... didn&#39;t she eat already? Why was everything feeling so confusing? She watched as her brother started to eat his nuggets, and so she shrugged off her feelings and followed his lead, unaware that her brother had once been HIS few months younger, college aged girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Juanita held off on eating, sipping her soda, while Raoul happily chowed down on his burger, the Latino family enjoying their day at the mall all things considered. <br />
<br />
And of course, in the middle of their food at the center of the table, lay the camera of changes, right beside the picture of the family that had once been nothing more than work associates, and before that, friends from University. The camera would sit their for a few minutes in silence as the family happily ate their food, unaware of the reality altering power they could wield.<br />
<br />
This remained right up until...</p>
