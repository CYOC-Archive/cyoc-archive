<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early in the morning the search for other victims of the witch began. While the hut was an average size there was an elaborate basement with many passageways. Ty wondered if this was apart of the dungeon they escaped earlier. Either way Ty didn’t want to take any chances. He had the search party split up into groups of 4 and were tasked with finding other players, and any useful items. Ty’s group consisted of himself, Jackie, Aaron who despite having the strength of a below average woman did her best to lug her heavy and cumbersome milk laden breasts and the necromancer who introduced herself as Kelly. Together the four slowly made their way down one of the corridors. <br />
<br />
Along the way they saw several rooms with ingredients and potions, there was a little library filled to the brim with various spell books. Jackie had pocketed several potions that looked beneficial as well as the witch’s note book on her brews. She thought that maybe somewhere in this book there would be a way to undo the witch’s spell for both her and Aaron. Kelly had scoured the library for anything to help with her black magic. Most of the books she found were recipes and botany books. However one book stood out. Locked behind a glass case a big black book with a strange inky symbol that shifted from one symbol to another and as she stared at the book it seemed to call out to her. The words were barley recognizable they seemed distant and weak but two words Kelly could hear  were “Break” and “Game”<br />
<br />
Kelly was deep in thought as the the meaning of what she heard but as suddenly as the whispering words came they dissolved back into the void. Kelly knew one thing, this book was special. She opened the case and took the book out. She noticed know that the book was covered in chains and padded with several locks. Whoever sealed this book up clearly never wanted it to be open again. Kelly slipped the book into her satchel and carried on with the others. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Ty was searching a old dirty storage room with Aaron. The two thought there might be some magical weapon or armor that could give them a serious advantage for facing whatever strange beings lurked in this realm. Plus since Aaron’s change she no longer had any armor. Luckily for her one of the warlocks gave her a spare black robe, but with her new physique it barely covered her. She looked to be wearing sexy robes that showed off a large chunk of cleavage not to mention large dark wet spots stained by her milk. And due to her large assets the robe only managed to just cover her huge hips so whenever she bent down she would flash her bare ass and pussy to the world. <br />
<br />
“There has to be something that will cover these things” Aaron said gesturing to his boobs and butt. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Aaron we’ll find something for you. Maybe we should first find some shoes for you.” Ty suggested since Aaron’s old fur boots were way too large for her now dainty feet.<br />
<br />
“I would gladly remain barefoot if it meant I got some proper support for these milk factories.” Aaron sighed, as the two continued to search the room but found nothing useful. <br />
<br />
After a few hours or exploring the group came to one last door. It was an old wooden door with large metal hinges. Jackie made quick work smashing open the lock, wooden splinters falling to the floor. Slowly they made their way inside. This room seemed to be a prison cell mixed with a laboratory. There was a smooth stone table with sharp cutting blades, and on the floor, torn and dirty clothes. Ty and Aaron were turning the corner around a shelf lined with potions when they saw a strange creature chained up to the wall. From what Ty could tell this creature was a four armed  naga however this snake woman had row after row of breasts. Each row consisted of 4 DD breasts and they ran all the way down her belly to the end of her tail, however her top most row were larger than the rest roughly E cup. Ty had to guess this poor woman must have over 50 breasts each squirting milk. Together the group helped the boob/snake woman out from her chains and they set her down on the cobblestone floor. <br />
<br />
Immediately the woman’s four arms groped any boob it could. She even brought one up to her mouth and with her extra long snake tongue liked her nipple making sure it wrapped around the boob and nipple. Between pants the woman hissed “Th...thank yo...you. I thought I would never ssssssee the light of day again. I am forever in your debt, you ssssssaved my life now l sssssshall be your sssssslave.” <br />
<br />
“Your no ones slave. We are here to help the victims of the witch.” Ty explained, “We are looking for a friend who has been taken captive here. Have you seen a human female she is our friend.”<br />
<br />
“There issss no other here.” The woman replied. <br />
<br />
Ty was a bit confused “Eric? Is that you?”<br />
<br />
“How do you know my name?” Eric enquired.<br />
<br />
“It’s me Ty. And this is Aaron.” Ty said trying to be calming and reassuring. “These other two are other players Jackie and Kelly. We’re here to rescue you.” <br />
<br />
“But that can’t be. Aaron was turned to stone and...and....and” Eric said trying to wrap her head around what she was being told. It took several minutes for both Eric and Ty fill each other in on their experiences in the game. Apparently Eric spawned in near Arron and together fought through a goblin scout party only to end up in the middle of a forest when they were approached by the witch. Once they refused to follow the obvious trap they were attacked by the witch. Once Aaron was turned to stone the witch had taken Eric to her laboratory to experiment on her. According to Eric the witch was seeking a way to create the perfect assassin, one that was totally subservient to her. It seemed while the part of the assassin didn’t work as planned, the part of the submissiveness did. Deep inside her Eric has a need to serve, to be used and abused and since the witch no longer holds control over her she needs a new master. And Eric begged and pleaded with Ty to become her slave.<br />
<br />
“I will not take advantage of you my friend. We will find a way to fix you and Steph. But for now let’s get out of here. We all need to setup shop where we are all safe. Safe to uncover the magic done to us, safe to plan an escape for this game.” Ty explained, and Eric begrudgingly excepted. “You know you are handling this quite well.”<br />
<br />
“I guess I always was a boob man. And now I’m a boobipede, and get to play with them all I want.” Eric jokingly said, to which Ty and Aaron just shook their head. He was the same old pervy Eric underneath.  <br />
<br />
Once the mini dungeon was cleared Ty ordered all books, potions, ingredients, and armor be brought with them to the city. It would be best to explore somewhere behind guarded walls. Ty pulled out Steph from his satchel, she still a bit damp from her day as a living sex toy. “Don’t worry Steph we saved Eric. And we’re working on restoring you next. We all just need to make it to the city and then we can get to working on undoing all of this.” Ty stated, with which he received an affirming nod.</p>
