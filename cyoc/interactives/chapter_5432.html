<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It's OK,&quot; Matt said, rubbing the firm body that pressed against him.  &quot;It's stopped now,&quot; he added, letting his hand slip under the oversized shirt that now draped on Mr. Martin.  Gradually, the man relaxed and Matt's hand found its way around to scratch his hairy tummy.  Matt leaned over and began kissing Mr. Martin's small head.  Mr. Martin unclenched his hands and began to rub Matt's arms softly.  Before long, Mr. Martin started to feel heavy in Matt's grasp.  Matt tried to travel his hand up to find the sweet spot between Mr. Martin's hair-covered pecs, but tightening fabric bound against his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Matt exclaimed, and Mr. Martin looked up.  &quot;You're growing again,&quot; he said.  Mr. Martin pushed away from Matt, but didn't let go entirely.  Yes, there was no doubt that he had grown considerably since jumping back in the car.  &quot;I think it has something to do with us touching,&quot; Matt offered, hoping his words weren't too transparent.<br />
<br />
Mr. Martin looked around.  &quot;The car isn't any bigger,&quot; he said, &quot;But you are right about me.&quot;  He leaned away from Matt.  &quot;Let's test your theory,&quot; he said, and withdrew entirely to his seat, taking Matt's hands off his body.  He leaned out the door and swiped his shoes off the pavement, then slammed the door.<br />
<br />
They looked at each other for a long minute, and nothing happened.  Then Matt leaned over and put a kiss on Mr. Martin's cheek.  His face flushed, and he said, &quot;I definitely felt that.&quot;  Matt leaned back and surveyed the tightening clothes on Mr. Martin's frame.  The growing man continued, &quot;I think you are right about how to un-shrink me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt tried to move in on Mr. Martin, but now the larger man was stiff and wooden, resisting Matt's affection.  He kept Matt's hands from going back under his shirt, and said, &quot;Let's not do any more than we have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try to enjoy this,&quot; Matt said, and he leaned in for a serious kiss.  At first, Mr. Martin kept his teeth together, and Matt wondered, what it would take to break this guy's defenses down.  Then Matt felt his whole body sigh, and Mr. Martin's teeth widened before his tongue.  Then Mr. Martin opened his teeth and a thick tongue came out to meet Matt's own.  Strong hands grabbed Matt's body, and they kissed strongly now.  After a long, passionate moment, Matt leaned back and looked at the large face of his math teacher.<br />
<br />
Mr. Martin definitely seemed bigger, but how?  Had he shrunk, had Mr. Martin grown?  Matt looked around the car and out the window.  Both had happened -- Matt shrank and Mr. Martin AND the car grew.  &quot;It's working!&quot; Mr. Martin exclaimed pointing a muscled arm towards the windshield.  &quot;I saw the dumpster get a little shorter in front of the hood,&quot; and then he looked back at Matt.  &quot;But it looks like you got a little smaller too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's solve one problem at a time,&quot; Matt said quickly.  &quot;You'll be able to help me better once you are back to full size.&quot;  With a smile, Matt added, &quot;Now take off your shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Martin put his hands around the bottom of the shirt, but hesitated.  Matt felt a shiver pass over his body as he shrank slightly.  It was becoming clear that he was going to shrink as much as necessary to get into this guy's pants -- both literally and figuratively.  As he felt himself dwindle, Mr. Martin's expression changed, and he said, &quot;OK&quot;.  The large man whipped his shirt off, exposing his hairy, muscular chest.  He leaned his seat back, and Matt climbed atop his hairy friend.<br />
<br />
Matt hugged his big man and started rubbing his face against the fur and muscle that greeted him.  Mr. Martin brought his big arms around to either side of Matt and gradually touched him more and more aggressively, finally stripping off Matt's shirt.  Matt thought undressing was a great idea, so he broke away from his prey long enough to shed the rest of his clothes onto the floor on the passenger's side.<br />
<br />
Mr. Martin was less keen on letting naked Matt climb back onto him, but as Matt shrank though a few more inches the hesitation went away without a word.  Soon big hands were rubbing Matt's arms and legs, exploring his back and tussling his hair.  Matt started pushing his hardon into Mr. Martin's flesh more and more agressively.  After a minute, he found a broad nipple that needed extra attention to stand up.  Raising the other nipple, Matt felt a bulge pressing against his butt.<br />
<br />
Supporting himself on his knees, Matt reached down to find the bulging crotch of Mr. Martin's pants.  He pried up the fly, and an &quot;Uh,&quot; escaped Mr. Martin's lips long enough for Matt to feel another little shrink roll through.  Then Mr. Martin was silent and Matt held the man's wide cock in his hand, already twice as big as Matt's still-reducing one.<br />
<br />
Matt ground his crotch against the thick rod between his legs.  Small balls bounced along its length.  Soon Mr. Martin was tweaking Matt's nipples.  Matt reached down to squeeze Mr. Martin's thick pipe against his shrinking balls.  They played this way for a few minutes until Matt finally said, &quot;I think I'd better suck you,&quot; trying to sound as matter-of-fact as his remaining feet would permit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Matt, there has to be another way,&quot; Mr. Martin said slowly.  &quot;I -- I can't.&quot;  But it didn't sound like his heart was in it, so Matt simply waited, holding the man's hard cock in his hand.  As the heart beats ticked by, Matt felt Mr. Martin's erection growing again.  It swelled by half an inch and Matt looked in Mr. Martin's eyes as his body shrank.  Soon it was an inch, and the cab of the car seemed so much more spacious to Matt.  Gently Matt began to vibrate his hand up and down, and Mr. Martin closed his eyes.  An inch and a half had been added to the big boner and Matt was beginning to wonder how long this guy could hold out.  <br />
<br />
Finally, the giant groaned.  After two full inches had been added to the man's hard meat, he relented.  &quot;You better get down there before I change my mind again.&quot;  Matt easily slid himself into the space between the steering wheel and Mr. Martin's crotch.  Mr. Martin pushed his clothes down enough to expose the full length of his passion.  Putting both hands on the head of the large dick in front of him, Matt pushed his face into Mr. Martin's heavy balls and started licking.</p>
