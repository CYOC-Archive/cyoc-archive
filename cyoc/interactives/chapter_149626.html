<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kelly began to flick through options for how she would, &quot;change the world.&quot;  With every tab or option explored, at least two more tabs, dials, sliding bars, list of checkboxes, or an entire new menu would appear.  There must have been hundreds if not thousands of options, and those were just centered on the 3D model of a female human which appeared on screen.  She explored making the character taller, shorter, adding gills, an udder, and a dozen more, all the while a 3D model altered itself appropriately.   Although with every change, she would quickly undo it or never commit to it, content for the moment just to see what this strange modeling device could do.  Throughout all of this, she did not know how close she often came to completely altering humanity.<br />
<br />
 As she explored Kelly decided to make herself comfortable at her desk.  She kicked off her high top sneakers and removed her bra, letting her socked feet and B-cup breasts rest from a long, annoying day.<br />
<br />
Eventually Kelly stumbled across an interesting option which read, &quot;Import Personal Preferences.&quot;  Reading the phrase, Kelly at first was taken aback, but she was far too intrigued to stop.  She clicked &quot;yes&quot; and a message appeared on screen for her to give the Chronivac access to her webcam.  She authorized access to the camera and noted with some growing concern that the camera&#39;s on light changed from its usual light blue, to a neon, computerize green.  A progress bar quickly appeared, shot to 100%, then disappeared.  Kelly then watched as the 3D model on screen adjusted itself to look exactly like her.   While most people would find this sudden change concerning, Kelly found herself oddly in awe of the program.  Soon, Kelly was back to once more altering the 3d model, seeing what she would look like with larger breasts, if she was shorter, taller, thinner, changed her hair, changed her race, had cat ears, and more.  Before long she found herself laughing, forgetting the worries of the day.  <br />
<br />
After one particularly comical preview involving an elephant&#39;s trunk, dog legs, and bat wings for ears, Kelly once more hit undo as she laughed the last of her concerns away.  Slowly recovering, Kelly noticed a unique tab that she had, until now, overlooked.  Clicking and opening it up, Kelly soon found a list of her personal preferences ranging from lists of her favorite and least favorite things to eat, her friends, her favorite activities.  However, one option caught her attention as soon as she opened the menu: Fetishes.  With some curious embarrassment, Kelly opened it up to see what this Chronivac program believed were her sexual preferences.  Upon opening the menu, she sorted by high to low preference.<br />

Sock/Stocking Fetish<br />
<br />
Kelly stopped when she arrived at the sock/stocking fetish.  She found it strange that even such a fetish could exist let alone that she apparently had it.  Sure she enjoyed wearing socks and stockings and the more colorful the better, but she never thought of it as something she would get off to.  Even now as she sat in her deep blue jeans, simple gray T-shirt, and two mismatched socks, one was a simple neon pink with gray toes and heel, the other a repeating pattern of thick blue, white, and green stripes, she felt no desire to caress her foot.  She did like colorful socks and she always felt people looked more comfortable and happier in socks rather than barefoot or in shoes.  Clearly this was not a fetish and had to be a mistake.  Curious she decided to investigate a bit and selected the sock/stocking fetish drop down menu.  Here, as had been the case with nearly every option, there were a dozen or so other options that presumably allowed Kelly to augment the fetish in someway.  After looking through a few options she found something called, &quot;Desire Threshold&quot; and noted that it was a 2 out of a possible 10.  Kelly was about to use the slider when she noticed the number was also a text box meaning she could put in anything she wanted.  Thinking nothing of it, because again this had to be a mistake, Kelly typed in 200.  Upon doing so, a new dialogue box popped up which read, &quot;Setting the counter outside recommended bounds may have unintended side effects.  Do you still wish to proceed?&quot; At that same moment, Kelly received a phone call.  It was her best friend Cloe.  Turning her attention to the phonecall, Kelly decided to click yes to the dialogue box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kel,&quot; began Cloe, &quot;Listen, ya know how I was supposed to go to the Raging Apes concert tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, isn&#39;t that you&#39;re favorite band,&quot; answered Kelly as she half paid attention to the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; continued Cloe after a brief pause.  &quot;Turns out the guys who were supposed to drive me just got too high to drive so I&#39;m just hanging out at the Terrace Cafeteria if you want to meet up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure I&#39;ll be over in a few, just need to close down my computer,&quot; answered Kelly.  However, as she began to go through the process of shutting the computer down, she encountered another dialogue box.  &quot;You are trying to shut down the Chronivac 4.0 with unapplied changes.  Do you wish to apply these changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking the Chronivac was nothing but a toy, Kelly clicked Apply.  The main light of the Chronivac blinked, analyzing the new parameters and saving them.  However, this in turn caused another dialogue box to appear, &quot;Desire Threshold set above recommended parameters.  Do you wish to apply these changes to others?&quot;  Growing annoyed, Kelly slammed her finger down on the Apply button.  A second later, a third dialogue box appeared with a simple, &quot;Changes have been Applied,&quot; message.  With that the Chronivac and Kelly&#39;s computer shut down.  Not wanting her roommates to mess with her new toy, Kelly took her computer and the Chronivac and placed them in her personal safe hidden under her desk.  With that done, Kelly threw on a red plaid shirt and slipped on her high top sneakers.  As she did, two things caught her attention.  The first was that her shoes seemed to be a little bit larger on her than she last remembered, but she was quick to shove this off as just wear and tear.  Quickly shoving this thought aside, Kelly made her way out of her room, out the house, and to her car.  Along the way to her car, Kelly made the second of her observations, she was beginning to find wearing her shoes rather annoying.  They felt itchy, hot, and even though they were large on her feet, still her feet felt sore and cramped.  Kelly brushed these observations away.  She was going to see her good friend Cloe and nothing was going to interfere with her evening... or at least that is what Kelly thought.</p>
