<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I really wish I had more time to write at the moment. As it stands don&#39;t really expect anything from me at least for the rest of the month. Although there&#39;s one idea I really want to write as soon as possible.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, technically that wasn&#39;t right. She could think of quite a few people who might be able to help them, the government organization SALEM, the witch council, Abigail and at least half a dozen… acquaintances from their previous adventures. The only problem was that pretty much all of them either wanted to strangle Sofia, and by extension Rhonda, or Sofia wanted to strangle them. Put that on top of the fact that many of them were likely to already be affected by the curse and Rhonda knew that her friend would pick the option where she at least knew what she had to expect. So Rhonda wasn&#39;t surprised at what she saw when they left the store.<br />
<br />
“Was that really necessary?” she heard Emma speak up. Already way ahead of them Sofia stopped. “It was a genuine mistake. Niamh did nothing wrong, we did. If anyone should be punished, it&#39;s us. Come on, you’re the witch here, turn us into statues or sexdolls or whatever for screwing up the planet.”<br />
<br />
While a bit surprised, Rhonda could see both points. She had been pretty much attached to Sofia’s hip, sometimes literally, since her family moved to America during first grade. The german was a genuinely caring person, who wanted to help wherever she could, hence many of their adventures, though that was hidden under a rough and snarky exterior. But when her already limited patience was running out the line between being snarky or hurtful started to blur. Over years of character development her patience had at least now reached the level of normal people. <br />
<br />
They heard Sofia mumble something, but couldn&#39;t really understand it. “What did you say?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to,” she repeated loud enough for everyone to hear. “I just lost control for a moment and… it shouldn&#39;t have affected her anyways, Aunt Adelheid gives all her workers strong protective charms… she probably lost it while searching… I just want to end this as soon as possible, who knows how many people might&#39;ve already been hurt because someone lost control of their lust.”<br />
<br />
Sofia’s apology hung in the air for a few more moments in which only the wind and faint mermaid moans could be heard. “I- I didn&#39;t know you’re worrying about so much–”<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have to apologize. I’m aware I’m not always the most pleasant person to be around.”<br />
<br />
A few more moments of only audible mermaid moans later. “So, where are we and how did we get here?” Millie asked to change the topic. Only now did Emma notice they weren&#39;t back in the mall, but rather in what seemed to be an alley in a suburban shopping street.<br />
<br />
“I already told you how the doors to Adelheid’s shop can take you to it from anywhere. If you know how they work it&#39;s simple for a witch to rig the return spell and have it send you to whichever place you want to. Unless there&#39;s an emergency in the shop, in which case the connection will be hard locked to the last used location to make it easier to contain.” Rhonda saw it as a good sign that Sofia was already back in explanation mode. “What you see right here is our hometown, because I need the help of my mother for the necessary ritual to stop this.”<br />
<br />
“But didn&#39;t you say your mother was also affected?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that&#39;s why I took these.” Sofia held up a small box of what looked like cough drops. “These mind drops should clear her mind of any affliction just long enough to help us prepare everything. The headband would’ve been better, but this was the best I could find and grab without my aunt noticing.”<br />
<br />
While Emma and Millie were starting to question if it really was that wise of a decision to trust this german teen girl that just appeared on their doorstep, Rhonda simply commented, “You really don&#39;t like asking your aunt for help, do you?”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s the one who always promised me when I was younger that I could take whatever from her shop whenever I needed. I’m just keeping her to her word. Anyways, it might not be easy to make my mother take this, so here&#39;s what we’ll do…”<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Rhonda had to admit, Sofia’s plan was sound. Emma and Millie stood guard to block any outside mermaids from trying to enter for an orgy. Sofia and Rhonda had then entered the bathroom her mermaid-ified parents were still playing around in. The former then grabbed onto her father and teleported themselves away, so Rhonda would be unobstructed when making the mother take one of the drops. Everything had worked up to this point. <br />
<br />
What the latina didn’t expect was for Eva to immediately lunge for her the moment they were alone, making her drop the box of drops. She expected even less for the adult witch to be lucid enough to cast a levitation spell on herself to continue hunting her while in mermaid form. The chase through the Weinerschnitzki house didn’t last long. <br />
<br />
And that&#39;s how Rhonda found herself in her current situation, pinned to the floor by Sofia’s lust-crazy mermaid mother.<br />
<br />
Not that she was complaining that much. Even before the mermaid chaos Eva Weinerschnitzki was what Rhonda would describe (when her friend wasn&#39;t around) as an S-grade MILF. Unlike her older sister Adelheid she was definitely in her best years with a big bountiful bosom and childbearing hips. Rhonda would be lying if she said that this woman hadn&#39;t managed to occasionally sneak herself into her fantasies. <br />
<br />
And with the mermaid transformation all of that beauty was pretty much squared. Her face was very youthful before, but now she looked barely out of her teens with the blonde hair framing it glowing almost as much as the scales of her yellow tail. Her figure was putting hourglasses to shame with wider hips and enhanced breasts that were now around the size of beach balls. This bombshell was now looking at her with the most lust-filled bedroom eyes Rhonda had seen in her life. She wasn&#39;t sure who was to blame for her soaked pants.<br />
<br />
“Are you aware how cute you are, Rhonda?” Eva said as she trailed the latina’s face with one of her hands. “Just like your mother. You have zhe same eyes…”<br />
<br />
The dutiful Rhonda in her head wanted to wrestle herself out from under these big bounties and help the others. The horny Rhonda wanted to take advantage of this and maybe fulfill one or two of her fantasies. The rational Rhonda was wondering about Eva’s comment. While many had already commented that she was the spitting image of her mother, their eyes were actually the one big difference between them. Rational Rhonda was swiftly ignored as usual and when Eva moved down to ram her tongue into the girl&#39;s mouth horny Rhonda took full control and fully leaned into what was happening. <br />
<br />
As Rhonda was enjoying the tongue action, she barely noticed her own legs entwining, ruining her lower clothes in the process (though she couldn&#39;t care less at the moment), and turning back into a mermaid tail. Similarly neither noticed a small object travelling from Rhonda&#39;s mouth to Eva’s and being swallowed by the latter. Ultimately Eva parted their lips, lines of drool still connecting them, and looked at the gay, panting mess below her.<br />
<br />
“I always noticed how you were staring at my breasts.” Eva heaved her own massive mammaries for emphasis, drops of milk out of the mother’s nipples falling onto Rhonda’s face. “Do you want to know how a real german woman feels and tastes like?”<br />
<br />
Fuck it. Rhonda deserved a reward for all the shit she regularly went through and right now she was in paradise.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<i>A bit earlier…</i><br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, Rhonda, put one of the mind drops into your mouth,” Sofia said.<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“Just a safety precaution.”<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
When Sofia, Emma and Millie found Eva, she was lying on the floor, rubbing off a migraine.<br />
<br />
“Ugh… What happened… Sofia, <i> Schätzchen</i>, what&#39;s going on?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“The short version, someone accidentally got essence of the sea, transformation is spreading through singing and I need your help for the counter ritual and to locate the source.<br />
<br />
Eva groaned. “Okay, I’ll be with you in a minute. Prepare everything already and pour me a big glass of water.” She slowly pushed herself from the floor as her tail started to divide. “Where&#39;s your friend Rhonda?” she asked as she threw a look at her daughter&#39;s companions.<br />
<br />
Said three females looked at what was below Eva, prompting the mother to do the same, making her gasp. Rhonda in her mermaid form with an expression of pure bliss and a faint line of blood running down out of her nose.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, Rhonda, did zhe essence affect her too?”<br />
<br />
“Actually not that much, just Rhonda being Rhonda. Give her a bit and she should be fine.”<br />
<br />
While Sofia and Eva prepared the necessary spells, Rhonda managed to recover from her experience with the true power of Germany. They even had enough time for Rhonda to sneak back into her own home to grab a necessary change of clothes. Once everything was done Eva went with the group to the front lawn to see them off. The girls carried all the necessary ingredients in backpacks, while Eva hadn&#39;t bothered yet to put on any clothes.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you have everything? Maybe we should go back up and check and maybe soak a bit more in zhe bathtub–” Eva shook her head. “You should better go now. Zhe mind drop is starting to wear off.”<br />
<br />
With their goodbyes given the group was close to the end of their quest. The only thing left now was to find Joana Wells.<br />
<br />
“So, Sofia, where do we have to go?”</p>
