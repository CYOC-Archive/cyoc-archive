<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Closing her eyes, Petra reveled in the pleasure she was inducing in herself. With every knead of her cheeks, she felt her breath being pushed out, accompanied with a barely audible moan she couldn&#39;t help holding in. It felt so sinfully good, and her mind only turned more inward to all the new sensations blowing up in her mind. The taut tension in her soft ears now folded back on her head, the dangerously pointed <br />
fangs teasing her lightly drooping tongue, and especially the tickle of her restless tail flicking incessantly over her bare thighs all drove her joy skyward.<br />
<br />
The intensity of it all was making her legs shudder, and just as Petra was about to drop to her knees, a faint clicking noise shot into her immensely sensitive ears, making them flick upwards to attention. Her self-groping halted immediately as her eyes went wide in identifying the source of that sound. <br />
<br />
Someone was coming into the library.<br />
<br />
Letting her innate feline stealth and grace take over, she went into action, quickly snatching up the spell book and then sprinting in leaping bounds toward the exit. The high velocity air teased over her exposed nethers, procuring a light blush on her cheeks mid-dash. In no longer than an Olympic record, she reached the exit door and peered through its ajar opening. After making a quick glance to see if her coast was clear, she leapt through, shut the door behind her silently, and finally pressed her back against the wall out of view. <br />
<br />
Strangely not even out of breath at such an effort, Petra nuzzled her ear onto the door and listened intently. A gentle humming came to meet her focus, and her tense shoulders dropped. It was a familiar tune she got to know the librarian always made when indulged in her work organizing the library&#39;s many books. With the intense relief that she had not been discovered, Petra mulled over her next move.<br />
<br />
She felt a bit lost as this exit led into a faculty restricted area she had never been bold enough until now to peruse. Licking her lips with her feline tongue in thought, she resolved to follow the faint glimmer of an exit sign farther down one side. Her ears scanning like antennae, she padded soundlessly down the corridors worn dusty tiles. <br />
<br />
Flicking her eyes about, Petra noticed a broom closet with its light on inside. No one was in there at the moment fortunately, but it made clear she was the maintenance wing of the school. Continuing on she also saw a door on the other side of an unlocked, private unisex bathroom. Nature was not calling at the moment, so she treaded on approaching a corner.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a loud clang followed by a harsh rumbling burst into her ears suddenly, making her tail stand up stiff behind her. It was the school custodian rolling a garbage bin and he was going to cross right into her path. With nine lives worth of luck on her side, Petra swung open the bathroom door and leapt inside, shutting it just short of her flailing tail. She flicked the lock down and lunged up against the door, desperately hoping the old janitor neither heard or saw her move.<br />
<br />
The rumbling noise of the bin&#39;s worn castor wheels grew as her threat drew closer. Petra had both her fingers crossed, hoping he would pass by unperturbed. The growl of the passing non-recyclable beast reached its climax as she held her breath. But just as it was about to pass her hiding spot, it stopped.<br />
<br />
Petra&#39;s fur stood on end. What is he stopping for? Did she not shut the door silently enough? Her eyes locked onto the door knob, expecting it to begin turning, but something else completely unexpected assaulted her frenzied senses.<br />
<br />
The janitor loudly sneezed, shaking Petra almost out of her skin. He sniffled and then his faint muttering met her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn strays. I told Margaret to not just throw out what was left of her sandwiches. It&#39;s bad enough I&#39;m putting up with the changing seasons but now I&#39;ve go to put up with cats sneaking around here too? I don&#39;t know what the hell I did to deserve all these allergies along with this bullsh...&quot;<br />
<br />
His trailing voice was drowned out by the<br />
dwindling noise of the garbage bin as it rolled past the unseen source of his reaction. Petra stood back off the door and threw her fists up in triumph. Another victory for the school&#39;s new cat burglar. Smiling widely from all the recent thrill and excitement, she savored the residual adrenaline of having been literally a hair away from being caught. With a last flick of her equally charged up tail, she turned around to face the contents of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
For a tucked away secret, it was surprisingly clean to both her visual and olfactory senses. There was both a toilet and a urinal along with a sink across from them. A mirror hung down over the latter element, to which Petra found her attention most immediately drawn too.<br />
<br />
She stepped over to it and gasped in awe at what she saw. It was as if every artist&#39;s rendition of a catgirl had their best elements taken and thrown together to produce what she saw before her. She squealed in joy, but quickly hushed herself. Her pointed orange furred ears poked out of her hair and flicked about in her ecstasy. They were so cute on her, and her shining fangs only pushed the envelope further, their glean putting a threatening edge on her otherwise soft appearance. <br />
<br />
Moving around, she saw patches of fur situated over different regions of her body, namely her forearms, calves, and around her hips. She giggled ecstastically upon seeing the last element was essentially like a furred pair of panties on her. But she found herself most drooling in lust over her slender, smooth, and sexy tail.<br />
<br />
She turned herself sideways to the mirror and jutted her naked rear out, making her gorgeous new appendage proudly display itself to her hungry eyes. It wagged sensuously back and forth, every muscle&#39;s extension and contraction over its full meter long-length totally tantalizing her to the point of sensory overload. It had an irresistibly luxurious and luscious sheen to its fur, and Petra couldn&#39;t hold back herself back from touching it.<br />
<br />
She laid her hand onto its base and almost melted in the heat of feeling her touch both through her hand, and through her sensitive tail. Combining both that new erogenous zone of contact being stimulated, and the immaculate sight out of a wet dream before her, she was getting insanely turned on. Flicking her other hand&#39;s middle finger over her pussy lips, she was shocked to see how hot and wet she was down there.<br />
<br />
Petra felt her knees shudder again as before in the library, and recognizing herself falling into the same devilish desire, she had to make a critical decision.</p>
