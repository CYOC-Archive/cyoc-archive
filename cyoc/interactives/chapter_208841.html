<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun peaked up over the eastern horizon. Not everyone woke up as soon as sunlight entered their windows. Though some people are lighter sleepers than others. Mike twitched a bit as the sunlight went over his face. Eventually, his inner clock kicked in and he woke up. He felt an odd combination of both soreness and vigor. His hand absently went down his chest and he felt something wrong. Well, not a bad wrong, but something that shouldn&#39;t be there. He had let himself go after his first wife and he knew he was flabby. So why was he feeling solid muscles?<br />
<br />
Mike sat up in bed and looked down at himself. His dad bod had gotten a serious upgrade. Instead of a beer gut, he had a set of abs. His flabby pecs were now flat and solid. Where did all his fat go? Then Mike remembered last night; the bite, the change, the mating. Some of the details were still kinda hazy, but he had the feeling he was a lot more buff as a werewolf than he is right now. Well, he may be smaller, but he was no longer out of shape. Mike glanced at the clock and saw the alarm would be going up soon. He switched it off before rolling over and nudging his wife. &quot;Jeri, it&#39;s time to get up,&quot; he said softly.<br />
<br />
Jericho moaned before yawning and stretching. Her arm brushes her breast, which sent some quicker wake-up signals to her brain. Memories of yesterday flooded back in, from what she did with Mike last night to who she was before she used the Chronivac. She was also aware she was touching naked skin that was covered in fur last night. Jericho quickly got of bed and headed to the mirror. She was quite surprised to see the naked woman in there at first. But she reminded herself she had become a werewolf. And werewolves are supposed to change between human and wolf forms.<br />
<br />
Jericho took a better look at herself. Not only was she furless, she had lost a good deal in height and muscles. Not to say that she was unfit. In fact, she had the body of a fitness model with perky breasts and wide hips. The hair on her head was short, only going to the base of her neck, and was a smoky black. Her face was quite beautiful and bore no similarities to Jeff&#39;s. Jericho posed in the mirror a bit, liking her human form. Now that she was not in wolf form, her mind was a little clearer. She was now aware she was not a simple housewife, but a personal fitness trainer. Though most of her clientele had no idea she was a werewolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeri, you seem surprised,&quot; said Mike. Jericho turned to look at Mike and felt her heart pounding in her chest. She found him cute even before he became a werewolf. Now he was in much better shape. Her pussy still felt some soreness from last night, but now it throbbed with need again.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I get so into being a werewolf that it’s a shock when I turn human again,” said Jericho, “I’ve been a werewolf much longer than you so you probably won’t feel like that for years.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we should get ready for work,” said Mike as he started to get out of bed.<br />
<br />
Jericho quickly closed the distance between them. “What’s the rush?” she asked, “I think we’ve got time for a quick one.”<br />
<br />
“But Jeri,” protested Mike. However, looking at his wife’s naked body quickly woke up his libido, even if his dick was still a little sore from last night. “Ok, but it’ll have to be a quick one,” said Mike as he pulled back the covers.<br />
<br />
“I can pack a lot of pleasure into a little time,” said Jeri, stroking Mike’s shaft until it was fully erect. Once it was ready, she lowered herself onto it. Mike’s dick didn’t quite fill as completely when he was a werewolf, but for a human woman, it was plenty enough. Jericho moaned as she rode her human husband. There wasn’t nearly as much wild energy as there had been last night, but they had human limitations and they were still tired from last night. Mike probably wouldn’t last too long, but he did help his wife get to her peak by playing with and sucking on her nipples. Soon enough, the two of them moaned as Mike pumped another load into Jericho.<br />
<br />
Jericho painted and said, “Now I remember why I fell for you before you became a werewolf.”<br />
<br />
“I love you too, but I really need to get going,” said Mike. He gently pushed Jericho off before getting out of bed and rushing to get dressed. “Huh, gonna need some new pants,” said Mike as he put on his now-looser pants and tightened them with a belt.<br />
<br />
Jericho was aware she needed to get dressed too, but she wasn’t in a big rush. Her job started much later than Mike’s. She just watched her husband get dressed before he kissed her goodbye and left. Now she wondered what to do. There was still the Chronivac, but she had no interest of going back to being Jeff. She wondered if could initiate Jeff’s children into her pack with the moonlit bite or with the Chronivac. And how many of their neighbors would make good werewolves?</p>
