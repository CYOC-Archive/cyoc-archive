<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The games in the basement,” Finn’s dad said as Tom and Ben walked down the basement stairs.  When Finn had invited Tom to the game, he hadn’t said whether it was ok to bring a friend or not, so Tom was hoping that Ben was ok as a +1.  Worst case, they could just share a character.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Tom noticed was how dark it was in the downstairs - he could barely see as he and Ben carefully plodded down the steps.  As Tom descended, the first thing he noticed was someone moaning with a pronounced, reptilian lisp and a wet slapping noise.<br />
<br />
“Fucking dragons,” Tom thought to himself.  Although he couldn’t see it, he knew that Finn was down here fucking his slave, as usual.  At least that meant that Tom and Ben were first to the DnD game.  No way Finn would be doing that in front of the others.<br />
<br />
The moaning stopped as Tom heard something thud against the basement’s concrete floor.  His eyes adjusted, and Tom saw exactly what he had expected – Finn, the massive red dragon was standing next to the ruins of a small portable table.  Between his legs, Finn’s massive cock glistened with the fluids of the small red kobold that was laying on the ground in front of him – her belly bulging out in front of her while thick, red dragon cum oozed out of her still stretched vent.  <br />
<br />
That was when Tom noticed something strange happening – the kobold’s small body began to grow transparent, quickly leaving behind a pool of lavalike cum on the concrete floor as the kobold vanished entirely.<br />
<br />
“You weren’t supposed to see that!” the dragon cried out, his concern evident as a small puff of smoke shot out of his nostrils.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Tom heard Ben ask from behind him.<br />
<br />
Tom had wanted to ask the same question – this wasn’t the first time he’d walked in on Finn fucking one of his kobolds, but it certainly was the first time he’d seen it just… disappear.  <br />
<br />
“Ya, what was that?” Tom asked, “don’t tell me that kobolds are like chameleons and they camouflage themselves when they get embarrassed!”<br />
<br />
Finn snorted, briefly recomposing himself before replying, “Did you recognize her?”<br />
<br />
“No, is she a new kobold?” Tom and Ben replied in unison.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t tell me that when I changed myself into a dragon, it made it so that its normal for me to own a kobold…” Finn trailed off.<br />
<br />
“Well,” he continued, “I suppose she is a new kobold in a sense, that was Paul, he… er, she I suppose, is joining the DnD game.”<br />
<br />
“Hah!” Tom exclaimed, “you don’t mean Paul from…” <br />
<br />
“Yes, that Paul,” Finn replied holding up his phone, “I found an app that lets me create a simulated reality for the DnD game.  Everyone else is already in there.”  He said as he gestured to a crystal ball laying on the ground.<br />
<br />
As Tom looked into the ball, he could see the kobold from before, but now she was bound in chains – a worried look on her face as another, very obviously male kobold stood over her massaging its small reptilian cock.<br />
<br />
“So far we have a wolf assassin, mink prince, polar bear warrior, ram barbarian.  Oh, and of course, the new kobold bard.”  Finn said with a smile.  “I see you brought a friend Tom, don’t worry that’s fine, as long as two have your character sheets ready.  What would you like to be?”<br />
<br />
Tom felt fear begin to well up in his stomach.  Everything that Finn was saying sounded crazy, but something told him that it was true.  Tom didn’t believe in magic, but Finn was a dragon.  Maybe dragons were secretly magical?  Maybe they were so rare because they could alter reality?  <br />
<br />
Tom didn’t know what was going on, but he couldn’t come up with any other explanation for what he had just seen – a living breathing person just vanish into thin air.  Or the fact that his instincts were screaming at him, telling him that this was all real.<br />
<br />
“You mean, in the game?”  Ben asked with an ignorant inquisitiveness.<br />
<br />
“Ya,” Finn replied, “The only character creation rules are that we’re not using standard races.  I would prefer anthro’s but I’ll entertain creative requests.”<br />
<br />
Finn paused.  <br />
<br />
“Oh and keep the requests reasonable.  Paul stuck to a request that was a little too… overpowered for this game so I brought his power level down a little bit.  I’m sure you saw the results.”<br />
<br />
Tom didn’t know what to do.  The crystal ball was still centered on the kobold, and Tom just sat there watching as she rubbed a swollen belly.  There wasn’t any sound coming from the ball, so Tom couldn’t hear the words coming out of her mouth, but from the look on her face it was clear that she was trying to plead with the male kobold.  <br />
<br />
And frighteningly for both Tom the human and Paul the kobold, the more Paul begged, the bigger the male kobold’s lustful smile grew.<br />
<br />
Tom’s stomach sank as his fear grew.  Every instinct was screaming at him, telling him that he could very easily be the next kobold clad in chains.  His mind was racing.  This was so crazy, so far beyond anything he had ever experienced.  Mere seconds ago he thought he was walking into a normal DnD game, but now?  He couldn’t even comprehend the sight in front of him.<br />
<br />
Should he answer Finn?  Come up with a character and risk being transported into some madman’s BDSM pocket reality?  <br />
<br />
He didn’t know, so he did the only thing he could think of – he let his body take over and decide for him.  And that was a simple decision, because his instincts only gave him one choice: run.<br />
<br />
His body spun around, muscles tensing as he lunged for the stairs, only to hear Finn call out behind him, “You really don’t want to chicken out!”<br />
<br />
He heard the words and vaguely began to appreciate their meaning.  But all of the comprehension in the world wouldn’t have stopped his body, which was now irreversibly on a terrified autopilot, from booking it up the stairs.<br />
<br />
And unfortunately for Tom, the instant that his foot slammed down on the first step, Finn’s claw hit a button on the phone, and Tom’s fate was sealed.<br />
<br />
His body ran upwards, leaping up stair after stair towards the basement door that led to freedom.  He was so preoccupied with that door that he didn’t notice the white feathers growing out of skin, the yellow scales forming on his legs, his butt growing out behind him, or the fact that gap between the stairs seemed to grow higher as the rest of the world grew bigger.<br />
<br />
A clawed toe scratched against the top stair as the door was in reach – beyond it a blindly bright window to a salvation filled future.  But despite the fact that freedom was close, Tom couldn’t help but notice that the heavy, sinking feeling in his stomach was only growing worse, as fear transformed into the gelatinous interior of an egg before abject terror solidified into a calcium shell around it.<br />
<br />
Tom’s claws crossed the threshold as he found himself momentarily blinded by the bright upstairs light.  But when his eyes refocused, the place that Tom had exited into looked nothing like the suburban middle-class home that he had entered from.<br />
<br />
In front of him was a dirt field, surrounded by a massive wooden fence.  And all around it, pecking and scratching at the ground, were fluffy, human sized chickens.<br />
<br />
It was then that Tom noticed that his field of view was much wider than before – not only could he see the chickens milling about in the yard in front of him, he could also see the chicken coup that he had walked out of behind him.  And even more concerningly, jutting out from his back  was the white feathered backside of a chicken.<br />
<br />
Deep down, Tom knew what he was looking at, he knew that was his backside.  He could hear Finn’s words, “you don’t want to chicken out” echo through his mind.  He knew that the other chickens milling about weren’t human sized – instead, he was now chicken sized.  The same type of fate that Finn had forced on Paul was now being forced on Tom.<br />
<br />
Tom tried to raise his hands to his face, only to see two fluffy wings spread out to his side.  And he couldn’t just see them, he could feel them.  They were, after all, his wings.  And as he could now feel, they didn’t work anything like his old arms – the most he could do was stretch them out and flap them, but his shoulders and elbows didn’t bend in the right way to let him reach up to his face.<br />
<br />
Not that there would be anything to reach up with, he realized.  He couldn’t feel his fingers or hands anymore, and he already knew why.  His old human digits had been converted to the smooth nubs of a chicken’s wings.  <br />
<br />
Tom tried to take stock of his new situation.  The yard was big, or at least it seemed big from his new vantage point, and was surrounded with large wooden coups, each identical to the one he was standing in front of.  All the while, dozens of chickens milled about, mindlessly going about their business as they searched for food.  And while Tom could see that the area he was in was fenced off, his new body was too small to see over that fence.  It was a safe bet to assume that he was on a farm, but beyond that, Tom had no idea where he was.<br />
<br />
Tom heard a chorus of clucking and scratching as he inhaled the scent of dirt, feathers, and chickenshit, trying to make sense of his new situation, only for a sudden feeling of pressure to shoot through his new stomach.  And it was that feeling of a solid, egg-shaped object begin to move through him, that caused Tom realized to that he was now a she.<br />
<br />
She was a chicken, Tom realized.  The thing inside of her was an egg.  Her egg.  Her egg, inside of her chicken body.  And as the pressure increased, she realized that, like a chicken, she needed to lay.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
“Too bad about Tom,” Finn said as he finished up the character sheet on his phone, “but I’m glad you didn’t chicken out too.  Coming up with a good plot for one chicken is hard enough, not sure what I would do with two of them.”<br />
<br />
Finn looked over the sheet to make sure that everything was how he wanted it.  He’d taken some liberty with the stat sheet - Tanya the prized hen wasn’t going to be a normal chicken after all.  He’d given her the normal chicken stat line, but reversed int and wisdom, and lowered the charisma a bit.<br />
<br />
After all, Tom had been smart to run away, but not particularly wise.  That being said, Finn was considering bumping her stats a bit.  Or perhaps he could give her something like the stench racial from Troglodytes? Medieval chicken coups weren’t the most secure against the predators, and Finn didn’t want Tom making an early departure from the game.<br />
<br />
But it was the description that Finn was most concerned about for the moment:<br />
<br />
“Once a rival to Tharselex, Talysth the dragon had invoked Tiamat’s blessing in his quest to usurp Tharselex’s rule.  But when Talysth arrived at Tharselex’s cave, he wrongly believed that he was outmatched and, thinking that no one was watching, tried to run away.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t just Tiamat’s blessing that was on Talysth, as her eyes watched him as well.  And when he ran way, Tiamant decided to curse him with an appropriate form.<br />
<br />
Now Tanya the chicken, the formerly proud dragon finds herself about to lay the first of many eggs in her new life as a champion layer.  And unfortunately for Tanya, she’s about to realize that Tiamat made her eggs as big as her ego, with a frequency to match.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Finn mused, “I suppose that will do for now.”<br />
<br />
Turning to Ben he asked, “do you think I should homebrew a Champion Egg Layer class?  Maybe have her gain xp from every egg and level up with abilities and perks?”<br />
<br />
Much to Finn’s disappointment, Ben didn’t respond, instead just staring at Finn with fear in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Well I supposed I can figure that out later,” Finn said, “I’m assuming Tom told you how seriously I take my games.  And if not, well, you just saw.  Oh and don’t worry, I’m not malicious, as long as you play by the rules and RP a bit, I’ll make sure you have an amazing adventure.  So what do you want to be?”<br />
<br />
Finn tapped a claw against the concrete as he waited for an answer that didn’t come.<br />
<br />
“You did come for the DnD game right?”  Finn asked, “do you have your character sheet?”<br />
<br />
Still no response.  <br />
<br />
“How about a name?  Even just a race and class will do.  Don’t worry I’m not upset that you’re late.”<br />
<br />
Finn glanced at the Ben’s shirt – emblazoned on the middle of it was a the mascot for their local sport team – a red fox.<br />
<br />
“Are you into foxes?  How about an anthro fox mage? <br />
<br />
Ben just stared blankly.<br />
<br />
“No name, no race, no class?  I’m assuming you came for game?  Do you want to be a player or not?”<br />
<br />
Ben shook his head, eyes wide as he tried to figure out how to get out of the situation in a way that didn’t result in him ending up as a kobold or a chicken.<br />
<br />
“How about an NPC?”<br />
<br />
Ben kept shaking his head.<br />
<br />
“An animal?  I could have the party recruit a ranger, would you like to be an animal companion?”<br />
<br />
Seeing Ben just continue to shake his head, Finn threw up his arms in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Well, if you’re going to just sit there doing nothing, you might as well do it in game too.  An item it is!”</p>
