<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been nearly a month since James boldly re-invented himself. Now Jennifer, the young woman no longer thought twice about what clothes to wear when she got up in the morning, nor feel strange about putting on makeup. She hadn’t heard her family utter the name “James” in weeks and she was loving it. She was thankful for the respect that they had all shown her, especially her father, Henry. She felt a little trepidation about how he might react, but despite the initial shock he was nothing short of gentlemanly. <br />
<br />
Despite this, Jennifer couldn’t help but feel an air of unease around the entire situation. While Henry was still her father, she found that she no longer associated him with the man that had raised her. She wasn’t sure when that notion had changed. Was it when Henry had begun to change himself? Was it when she had accepted her new identity? In the end she accepted that she would likely never know, but the thought led Jennifer to other revelations. <br />
<br />
She found herself happy for Jess and Henry. Happy that Henry was so supportive and loving and happy of the bond that the two of them now shared. But Jennifer knew she would just be lying to herself if she said that there wasn’t a hint of jealousy in her thoughts. How nice it would have been for Henry to have said Horse, to have chosen her for his mate instead. But those feelings quickly subsided, and Jennifer found herself yearning to join the Happy couple as often as she could. In fact Jennifer had organised a dinner for them both, celebrating one month since her re-birth. A milestone that she felt comfortable celebrating. It was also a month since her last slip up, and from when he had last seen Henry and Jess, it was well over that for the entire family, at least as far as she could tell. For her, that deserved celebration.<br />
<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Jess and Henry sat at the dinner table, both wearing the nicest attire they could affix. Jess had a lovely blue dress on, with her hair tied up with a pretty red bow. You could see the thick padding of the undershirt that she wore to stop any embarrassing leakage.<br />
<br />
Henry meanwhile had found some dress pants. They looked a few sizes too big, but they were modest. Not tempting the eye or causing any unnecessary distractions. He completed the look with some black dress shoes and a loose fitting white shirt. All in all everyone looked their best.<br />
<br />
Jennifer clopped into the room with dinner in hand, or at least the start of it. She was wearing a black and white dress with sleeves that folded just above her wrists. The skirt finished just below her knees, which Jess raised a brow at, but promptly let it go. A belt loosely sat above her udder while she wore black leggings with the ends cut open, instead bunching them at where her hoof met her leg. Her hair had grown over the last month, letting her pin it back a little behind her ears, then ends of which brushed casually against her shoulders. She had even managed to find some lipstick and makeup to wear.<br />
<br />
“Ta-Da” Said Jennifer, placing down the plate of freshly steamed vegetables. She was nothing if not a conscientious hostess. “And don’t you worry your tails off, there’s more to come.” She hummed, buzzing back into the kitchen to return with more food. <br />
<br />
Jess wasted no time beginning to load up her plate, while henry just waited his turn. It wasn’t until the platter was almost empty when Jess realized her stomachs had gotten the better of her. “Oh! Sorry! Did you… Want any of this?” She asked, holding her now full plate out towards Henry. He just smiled, letting out a laugh. “There’s still more coming love, you dig in.” <br />
<br />
Relief flashed across her face as she obliged, turning her attention back towards the plate as she began to tackle her daunting portion size.<br />
<br />
Jennifer came back a moment later with another plate of greens, placing it next to the one that Jess had all but claimed. She smiled at her father. “Guess this is just for us then!” She said with a laugh, before starting to dish up their plates. “Guess so.” Henry replied warmly. <br />
<br />
Henry and Jennifer conversed over the meals, leaving Jess to tend to her food. Eating now almost took her into a trance. She was happy to start munching away and wouldn’t fully focus again until she had finished. But soon enough the three of them pushed their empty plates towards the table and patted their full bellies. <br />
<br />
“Oooh, I’m stuffed.” Jess groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me too. Thank you for dinner dear, that was beautiful.” Henry complimented his daughter, watching her blush in response.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it was nothing. Just sorry that Mom wasn’t feeling up to joining us. But I suppose I can understand.” She trailed off, quickly bringing the subject back around. She pushed her chair backward, standing up at the head of the table. She blushed before she spoke, looking down at the table to avoid making eye contact. “I just thought that we owed it to ourselves to celebrate a little. I was the last one to change here, and that was a month ago today.” <br />
<br />
Jess and Henry shot each other a guilty look, knowing that they’d broken their chastity barely 2 weeks ago. Thankfully Henry had managed to hide their indiscretion under looser clothing, but the fact remained it still happened.<br />
<br />
Jennifer continued “Not entirely coincidentally, that also coincides with how long I’ve been Jennifer.” Jennifer finally looked up, making sure to look at her Father when she spoke. “I just wanted to say how nice it’s been this last month, to be embraced as a sister and to have you embrace me as a daughter.” Jen’s eyes teared up a little as the others smiled. <br />
<br />
Henry finally let it sink in that his son was likely gone forever, and in his place was his new daughter. The more he looked, the less he could even recognize the old James. Instead, this beautiful creature stared back, foreign and familiar at the same time. He had to quickly shake his head before his thoughts wandered too far, breaking their hold by standing up himself, embracing Jennifer in a hug. He could feel the padding from her breasts push hard up against his chest as he gave her a pat on the back. “There there. That’s what family is for. You can always count on us to accept you.” Henry awkwardly mustered. He wasn’t the best at spontaneous speeches, but he didn’t feel like he was doing too badly.<br />
Finally, the two parted and Jennifer cleared her eyes. Beaming back at Henry, that spark of jealousy ever-present.<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” She said with a sniffle. “Onwards with our celebration - Who wants dessert?”</p>
