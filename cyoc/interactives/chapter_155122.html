<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John and Erin made their way from the park back to her house, and all too soon they were standing on the driveway between his car and her front door. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is it,&quot; said Erin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
&quot;The moment of truth. This is the point where every guy I&#39;ve ever dated kisses me goodnight, drives away, and never calls back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to do that,&quot; said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
John shook his head. &quot;But I&#39;m still going to kiss you just the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Erin, almost too surprised to react, had to process the fact that John&#39;s lips were suddenly on hers, and his arms were wrapped around her human waist and resting on her withers. About four seconds went by before she had the wherewithal to kiss him back and hold him tight against her bountiful bosom.<br />
<br />
A moment later, they were catching their breath, and Erin said, &quot;Sorry about that; it&#39;s just been a *really* long time since I&#39;ve actually been that close with a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you want in on a little secret, it&#39;s been a long time for me too,&quot; said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;You!? Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;m no good at finding my own dates, and my friends have this nasty, years-running track-record of setting me up with psychos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Ouch&#39; doesn&#39;t describe the half of it,&quot; said John. &quot; &#39;Keep the fire department on speed-dial!&#39; would come closer.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both laughed, and then Erin opened her front door and said, &quot;Earlier, I believe I offered to open a bottle of wine. That is definitely happening now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before they knew it, John and Erin were both reclining on her couch, each with a wine glass in hand. That couch was big enough that it dominated Erin&#39;s living-room, and Erin still took up more than half of it with her body resting on the cushions and all four of her legs drawn up close. John was actually able to get a look at her horseshoes now, and asked what exactly the glittery, silvery metal was. &quot;Mithril?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure Tolkien made that word up,&quot; said Erin. &quot;It *is* elfin steel, but they call it something different.&quot;<br />
<br />
That led to a deeper discussion of fantasy literature and mythology which, as it turned out, Erin was extremely knowledgeable about—especially classical Greek and Roman myth. She was able to match John point for point on just about any topic involving the old gods and all their myths and legends. And when it came to magical and religious practices, she was actually significantly far more learned thanks to her heritage and the front-row seat that provided.<br />
<br />
The hours wiled by, until three empty wine-bottles sat on the coffee-table before them, and John and Erin were leaning close and feeling pleasantly flushed from the alcohol and the company. When John leaned in and planted a gentle kiss on Erin&#39;s lips, she responded warmly and pulled him close. When they broke it off to take a breath, Erin said, &quot;I never thought I&#39;d do this on a first date, but—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s been a while,&quot; said John. &quot;I know what you mean.&quot; He brushed his hand through Erin&#39;s hair and said, &quot;This isn&#39;t just happening because we&#39;re drunk and desperate, is it? I really like you, and I really want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too,&quot; said Erin. &quot;And that&#39;s not just the wine talking. You&#39;re a great guy, and I don&#39;t want to mess this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to mess up either,&quot; said John. &quot;You&#39;re an amazing girl—centaur?—centauress,&quot; he decided on that last word, hoping through the inebriation that it was the correct one.<br />
<br />
They resumed kissing, but this time John boldly moved to pull Erin&#39;s t-shirt off. She raised up her arms and let her lips break contact with John&#39;s just long enough for the shirt to pass by and up over her head. This left Erin wearing only one article of clothing, a lacy gray bra (which must have had some industrial-grade integrity, to contain her centaur-sized knockers without bursting whenever she moved at any speed faster than a canter). Erin then reciprocated, pulling John&#39;s shirt over his head, and she gasped when she saw her date shirtless. He was *ripped*. &quot;Oh . . .&quot; she practically moaned, just from the sight of him. &quot;Where were you hiding all of *this*?&quot;<br />
<br />
John chuckled. &quot;I do martial arts,&quot; he said by way of explanation. &quot;Big nerd, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin bit her lower lip, reached back behind her human torso, and undid the clasp on her bra. She held it fast for a moment, teasingly, and then let the undergarment drop, and along with it came the bounce of her gloriously revealed tits. If John wasn&#39;t already standing at full mast before, his jeans and boxers were definitely uncomfortably tight now. &quot;Your turn,&quot; said Erin.<br />
<br />
John was hesitant. Erin said that they should be &#39;compatible,&#39; but could a man really measure up to a centaur? He undid his jeans, hooked his thumbs inside the waistband of his boxers, and slid everything down. <br />
<br />
Erin immediately reached out and took John&#39;s cock into her hands, giving it a few soft, tentative strokes. He was rock-hard and ready. At this point, she wouldn&#39;t need much encouragement. &quot;Kiss me,&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
And so John eagerly did exactly that: he kissed Erin&#39;s lips, and he kissed Erin&#39;s neck, and he lavished the attenions of his lips and hands all over Erin&#39;s glorious breasts. He just couldn&#39;t get enough of those: they were huge and yet somehow spectacularly gravity-defiant. That must have been some kind of fairy-magic, right?<br />
<br />
For her part, Erin just leaned back on her couch and luxuriated in the wonderful sensation of having a man touch her all over. This what what she&#39;d longed for, what she&#39;d missed all these years, and it was finally about to happen, at long last. . . . Wasn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
While Erin used her hands to keep John&#39;s erection at full, he teased her nipples with his kisses and his tongue until she almost couldn&#39;t take it anymore. The pleasant sensation gave way to the tingle of over-stimulation, and Erin wondered whether John weren&#39;t hesitating to move on from her human half.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really like my tits,&quot; she said with a gasping breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re so beautiful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can&#39;t take much more,&quot; said Erin.<br />
<br />
John immediately backed off. &quot;Oops!&quot; he said. &quot;Guess I got carried away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin responded by standing up off the couch, while at the same time taking John by the hand and standing him up too. She kissed him; and then she pranced about in a tight circle so that her hindquarters faced John. She looked over her shoulder, met John&#39;s eyes, and lifted her tail, revealing the dripping wet, black leathery lips of her vagina. &quot;Fuck my mare-pussy!&quot; she said. &quot;Please, I can&#39;t take it anymore—no more teasing!&quot;</p>
