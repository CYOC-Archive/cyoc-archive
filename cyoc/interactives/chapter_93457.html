<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karl and Alice suddenly tensed, feeling the fur on the back of their necks rising. By the light of the cellar, they could now see that there was someone lying on the ground, outside the small window high up the far wall. And the shadowy figure was aiming at the glass with a stone…<br />
<br />
The window broke into myriad pieces after several bashes. Taking care to avoid cutting their hind paws, the newly-born werewolf couple edged forward, growling…<br />
<br />
“Sammy…Cornetto!” Karl barked in surprise. “You saw…us…change! How…did you…get here?”<br />
<br />
The black P.I. nervously eyed the two lycanthropes before him, down in the cellar. “I placed a bug on your car. When I saw that there was one there already, I really started to get interested in you pair and what you were up to… Guess your abductors placed the other bug on you, at your home. That’s how they first found out ‘bout this place.”<br />
<br />
Alice snarled at Sammy, but then calmed down. “Look’s like…you did…the…right thing… If you’ve…come to…help us…, that is…!” she replied, still getting used to her new manner of speech.<br />
<br />
He nodded. “Guess I have. I couldn’t hear through the window – but I saw the whole exchange with yourselves, Miss Yeller, and your not-so friendly werewolves with their hardware pal. Oh, yes… I know about Dwayne Wyatt. He’s a known prolific criminal. And it seems that I’ve found Roxanne Dahmer after all, as well...”<br />
<br />
“It’s Roxanne…who is…your…serial killer…,” Karl growled. “She and…Kevin will…return soon… to…slaughter us!”<br />
<br />
“I won’t waste time, then! Can yer get through this broken window?”<br />
<br />
“You are…still small…enough…, I think.” Karl gave his mate a wolfish grin as he patted her shoulder. Nodding, Alice allowed Karl to lift her up towards the cleared out gap of the shattered window. Nervously, Sammy Cornetto grabbed hold of the wolf woman’s wrists and eased her through, as she wriggled her lithe figure out of the cellar.<br />
<br />
Alice paused to drink in the night outside, her lupine ears picking up the noises of owls and other birds in the woods that surrounded the house that Karl’s aunt had owned. The light wind brushed against her gorgeous pelt. For a moment, Alice considered the fact that she was now naked – dressed only in fur, just like an ordinary wolf would be. And she didn’t have to be afraid of the dark – she was now a predator, like Sally, and like Karl. She grinned and allowed her tongue to loll out to taste the air. Her tail twitched with excitement. She felt alive and strong – stronger than she had ever been before! And soon she would need to prove her strength, to help defend her pack mates…<br />
<br />
Turning, she faced her beau. “Can you…get through…, Karl?”<br />
<br />
He shook his lupine head. “I will…ambush Roxanne…and Kevin…from…this side, when they… come down,” he growled. “Get inside…the house, Alice. Help…Sally and…Sammy. Take the…rogues down…after they…open up…the cellar!”<br />
<br />
She growled in agreement. Turning to Sammy, she saw the P.I. pull out his pistol.<br />
<br />
“I came prepared with silver bullets,” he answered Alice’s unspoken question. “Now let’s find the right door for me to use my skeleton key!”<br />
<br />
“Allow me…to do…the honors…,” Alice rumbled as she rose to her hind paws and loped to round to the kitchen door.<br />
*     *     *<br />
<br />
On the top floor of the old house, two stories above the ground floor, Dwayne took Sally to the toilet, following her directions. They passed the floor inbetween – where Sally could hear Roxanne and Kevin engage in their lovemaking in the main bedroom, too wrapped up in each other to pay attention to them. Although that played to Sally’s advantage, she was disgusted to learn that the rogue couple had chosen her bedroom, her primary territory, to copulate. Nevertheless, she forced herself to control her trembling and rising anger – to instead focus her emotions into action…<br />
<br />
The biker henchman cut her hands free from her cords. But as she opened the toilet door, Sally froze in terror as Dwayne suddenly pressed the barrel of his pistol into the side of her head.<br />
<br />
“I reckon I’ve seen you before, Sally Yeller. Think you were at my college… You still have a nice figure, a nice ass…,” he leered.<br />
<br />
“I thought I sensed where your eyes were looking…,” Sally muttered darkly. “And I remember you, Dwayne. You stalked my friend Juanita at college. Luckily, you were expelled from the premises before you could hurt her again, after she turned you down… But hey, never mind that she got away! You can have me instead – once I’ve done my business, that is.”<br />
<br />
“No tricks. I’m loaded with silver.” Dwayne removed his gun from her skull. His rasp was raspy, and Sally glanced at him, smelling his rising lust.<br />
<br />
Forcing a smile, she shut the toilet door and locked it, but she didn’t switch on the light. Quickly getting completely undressed, she focused her mind and called to the wolf dwelling within her…<br />
<br />
After initially having fought against her lycanthropic side, Sally had been forced to re-evaluate herself after being revealed to the world as a werewolf. That led to her later accepting and embracing her lupine nature. Doing so had led to many things – the most recent being videotaped by Alice as Sally demonstrated on film her consequent new-found ability to transform of her own accord, on any night. This was almost unheard of amongst the humanoid werewolves who had been exposed within the last six months. And her repeated practice would now make perfect…<br />
<br />
A sudden rush of heat to her head made Sally sweat. Keeping her eyes closed, she grunted as her bones abruptly shifted. Seconds later, her body changed smoothly into the form of the wolf woman that was now her second nature. Her blonde fur erupted from her skin pores and swept across her contorted form, cloaking her. Sally snapped open her now-amber eyes at the same time as her skeleton and muscles reconfigured themselves – her face, jaw, nose, and ears all assuming their lupine positions, even as her human hair receded halfway into her altered skull and merged with her cranial fur. Sally’s claws and fangs grew into place – and within the half-minute her transformation was complete. She panted with the effort and leaned against the wall to recover. Apart from her fur, the only thing she was wearing now was the werewolf I.D. armband around her forearm.<br />
<br />
“Finish up, and unlock the door – ‘fore I break it down, bitch! Yur hear?” Dwayne snapped. He rattled the door handle.<br />
<br />
Suppressing her snarl, Sally reached out with her half-paw to flush the toilet, to fool Dwayne. Then, opening the window, she picked up the container for the scrubbing brush and tossed it through the gap.<br />
<br />
“Wha-?” Dwayne dashed over to the window on the stairwell, next to the toilet – wondering what had fallen down into the yard below. In the moment that he realized that the toilet window would have been too small for his captive to escape through, Sally had unlocked the door and leapt out at Dwayne as he returned to the toilet door. She snarled, swiftly grabbing his gun arm and sinking her claws into his wrist. He screamed – then yelled as the humanoid werewolf yanked him forward into the toilet. He fired, but the bullet only struck the wall. Then the thug grunted as he was slammed hard, head-first, against the opposite wall. One twisted arm later, he dropped the pistol. Seconds later, the concussed Dwayne found his face being stuffed deep into the centre of the toilet seat. As Sally used her weight and strength to hold him down, she slammed her palm down again on the lever flush.<br />
<br />
“Yuuurrrggghhh…!”<br />
<br />
Calling upon all of her memories of how Dwayne had plagued Juanita - as well putting Karl, Alice, and herself in grave danger – Sally held the henchman’s face under the flow of water until some moments after he had stopped resisting. She growled with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
“I am…no bitch… I am a…she-werewolf. And I…am finally proud…to be one! Now… Be down… the Dwayne…with you!”<br />
<br />
Turning her attention to the man’s dropped pistol, Sally discovered that she was unable to hold the weapon with her half-paw. Throwing it out of the toilet window instead, in case Dwayne recovered, Sally bounded downstairs to join the battle she could now hear taking place…</p>
