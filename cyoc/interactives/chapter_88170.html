<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I.. I guess.. that I&#39;ll have to choose..  To work off the payments. &quot; and in that second his teeth gleamed as his lips stretched into an almost horrific feral like grin as I gulp it vanished  the next second, for a second I thought I only imagined it but.. no It was definitely there.. I&#39;m sure of it but if it was why.. &quot;Alright Mr. Bubanzo I Believe I can find something for you to do I may need a new bartender with the way my current one is acting..&quot; The words he speaks deep and demanding as he ponders before he nods his head &quot;Um b-but don&#39;t you need.. like.. training to bartend?&quot; he raises a brown eyebrow as he looks at me &quot;Not as far as I&#39;m concerned all you have to do is pour drinks we have a sign that says no special mixes just the brands &quot; I try to fake a smile as I nod agreeing to the terms and it happened again that grin showed up but left like it never even happened &#39;I&#39;ll have to ask someone about it&#39; &quot;well lets get it over with Mr. Bubanzo&quot; Artur stood up to his full height letting anyone who seen him know he carries himself with power and dignity with each step out to the bar and for the second time ever every eye were staring at me with curious polluting their eyes, one more so adoration for saving him as we walk over to the bar Artur clears his throat to interrupt the conversation between a greasy looking guy and a girl who was classified way out of his league with a gracious look on her face to the giant grizzly she notices me before shrugging obviously unaware of what to do and as the silence started to lurk into the air Artur&#39;s voice rips through it like the predator he looks to be &quot;Mr. Sullivan I&#39;m sorry to say this but as of today your employment has been officially terminate&quot; as if he never said anything Sullivan was staring at him like a deer caught in head lights in disbelief &quot;What?! You.. You can&#39;t do that! Where are you going to find a replacement at this hour I&#39;m the only one who works this shift. Heck I&#39;m the only one willing to deal with a good portion of these idiots at night! Who is it replacing me?&quot; I can&#39;t help but shift unconsciously as two sets of new eyes focus in on me the feeling behind them quite obvious one with the feeling of a grin in the air while the other was absolutely seething &quot;HIM!? The little queer and his lovers quarrel a second ago is proof he&#39;s just trouble. Why do you think I asked you to come out when I seen him and his gang come in here?!&quot; he shouted making a big scene &quot;Yes. Him and I ask you in kindly to not talk about one of my newest employee&#39;s like that or I&#39;ll have to escort you out.. Personally Edward!&quot; He just growled before he walks out pushing over chairs and people on his way out Artur returning his ever piercing gaze back onto me I blush subconsciously as I get behind the counter looking around and familiarizing myself with the layout of the bar quickly before I realize everyone was still watching me like hawks at their newest prey I let out a small laugh before saying just loud enough for everyone to hear &quot;Heh.. I guess I&#39;ve gotten into a bit of a mess.. what? something on my face?&quot; everyone as if snapped out of a trace go back to their chatter more heavy of the events of the night most looking back at the new guy with grins of mixed feelings most being that of lust and respect for not only standing up for some kid but getting rid of the sleaze ball of a bartender. a few wondering what&#39;s to happen next. &#39;As the night went on it wasn&#39;t really that eventful honestly the kid from earlier thanked me then left to get a new hotel room a few guys came over to talk to me and causally flirt with me which I shrugged off, the girl came over and 21 questioned me of what it was the whole scene about&#39; finally at the end of my shift when the bar was closing up, and was wiping off fancy crystal wine glass and as I walk to put it up I tripped and in the process I wretched into the cabinets, knocking over two or three bottles to smash on me and drenching me in alcohol and adding up the costs but as I look trying to see which of the cheap ones they were my heart fell as my eyes went higher and higher from the bottom of the super cheap ones to the very top that could easily equal anything I could make as a nuclear engineer in four years times twenty then add three zeros to the beginning before you get close to their values I gulp tears starting to flow from my eyes and before I knew what was happening I felt myself being pulled to my feet and seeing the bruin of a boss I struggle to get away afraid of what he might do only to be pulled into a tight embrace my eyes failing to hold back tears as he hugs me close to him my head resting just under his chest  the sound of his heart soothing me a bit &quot;Sssshhh... Your alright.. your okay.. you&#39;re not hurt are you?&quot; wanting to speak against it to say I wasn&#39;t that I&#39;m sorry for breaking the most expensive wine I&#39;ve ever they had but for some reason all I could do is shake my head no and step closer to him &#39;What the fuck is wrong with me? with him? I just broke wine he&#39;ll only have once and he&#39;s trying to sooth me?!...&#39; &quot;w-why..&quot; he looked at me curiously not fully understanding the dangerously loaded question &quot;Why what?&quot; His voice deep as ever but smoothed out nearly bringing me back to tears &quot; Why aren&#39;t you mad? Why are you trying to cheer me up when I just broke your most expensive bottles you have? Why aren&#39;t you even slightly mad?!... Why me...&quot; and in the split second he just starts laughing &quot;Well plenty of reasons why I worry about my employee&#39;s, it&#39;s just wine it&#39;s not diamonds, Your more important, and that one I&#39;m not really sure of but I guess the reason of why you.. Is because I like you being around&quot; he grins and does the thing I never thought I&#39;d see him do &#39;he..  he...  just blushed..  this grizzly of a man.. just blushed..&#39; &quot;Um.. wow.. heh..&quot; As if something in his mind clicks at what I just said his eyes dart up to where the highest shelf is and sure enough three of his best were gone then looking to the floor his face went from sheepish to pure anger I gulp wanting to hold back the forming tears and seeing me the anger all but vanished as he ruffles up my head &quot;I just found a reason to skin that sleaze ball worker I fired, the thing you tripped on was the company weapons choice of protection that he took out of the case to show off he was the only one with the keys to it last so it&#39;s actually his fault not yours&quot; He grunts locking up the gun with a growl so.. I imagine you need a new place to stay.. since the jerks you came in with were your buddies? I guess you guys bought a hotel room together so I  can get you a room or you can stay at my place for a little bit it&#39;s you call&quot; Artur said with a bit of nervous edge into it &quot;well.. um... okay.. I guess.. I&#39;ll just..</p>
