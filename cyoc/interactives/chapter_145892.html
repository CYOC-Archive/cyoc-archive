<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a long nap, Edwin woke up and called his sister through his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dawn. Do you want to hang out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. I&#39;m going to pick my first transformation. So, that means you won&#39;t see me as always.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What transformation did you choose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A grizzly bear. I wanted to be the big sibling for once!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, you won&#39;t because I will choose to be bigger than you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re in the Age Wing! There&#39;s no way you can be bigger than a bear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin put his phone on the desk and he took the survey next to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can be bigger too.&quot; He said while he filled out the survey. He made sure to be bigger in every possible aspect, including his weight and manliness. Maybe he exaggerated a little. When he finished he read what he wrote and then he immediately regretted it, he was going to become a bearish old man. However it was too late to change his mind because the room told him that his transformation was going to begin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, shit...&quot; He muttered as a red light covered all the room. &quot;I can&#39;t move.&quot; Luckily, he stood still in front of a big mirror so he could be able to see his growing up.<br />
<br />
Although he recently had turned 16, his lightly tanned skin was blemished with acne that scattered his cheeks and forehead. However, he had a squarish face that still captured his boyish charm. He was wearing a low-cut tank top that exposed half a dozen hairs in the centre of his chest. A sparse, wispy goatee rested on his chin with pride, the only facial hair he could grow for now.<br />
<br />
On the ceiling appeared a big red signal that displayed &quot;Current age: 16&quot;. Edwin was quite scared about what was coming now and some drops of sweat were moving down his skin. After a good few seconds had passed, the number ticked over to 17.<br />
<br />
Edwin was seriously watching at the number on the ceiling. He frowned, it was going too slow and he was getting impatient. However, when he looked back at the mirror he realized that half his head was no longer in frame. It was almost like he had a growth spurt. Edwin slightly raised an eyebrow when he noticed that his face looked more angular and his jawline resembled a brick. His acne outbreak seemed less vicious, and his goatee looked fuller and thicker. Edwin was impressed at how much he had changed without him noticing it.<br />
<br />
20...21...22... It was clear that Edwin was no longer a teenager. A shadow of brown stubble crept across his cheeks while his chin goatee had expanded to surround his entire mouth with a classic van dyke beard. His small number of chest hairs had increased considerably and now thick hairs curled across his upper chest like an animal and were still growing and spreading towards his shoulders. He could make out a wide line of kinky hairs continuing their passage down his stomach through the thin fabric of his tank top. It was almost like a second skin, fitting tight across his growing chest and sticking to his defined torso. He&#39;d always been an active guy, but it was as if he had taken up weight lifting in college. Edwin smirked at this newfound athletic structure, maybe it wasn&#39;t too bad after all.<br />
<br />
25...26...27... The physical changes had mostly slowed down, yet Edwin noticed something odd. A few hairs on his head were falling down while his forehead was getting more prominent than usual. It was almost as if he was... As his hair was buzzed shorter, it finally hit him that he was balding. His hairline had already receded past his sideburns. Then, in a second his thinning hair vanished. His scalp had been shaved clean, with nary a shadow visible on his smooth head. Edwin couldn&#39;t see it but he was completely terrified of his new baldness and he wasn&#39;t even 30!<br />
<br />
30...31...32... Edwin rolled his eyes, already bald while his dad was older and had a full head of hair. At least he rocked the look, it made him look tougher. Plus, he had grown out the stubble on his cheeks to turn his goatee into a trim full beard to compensate for his chrome dome. It certainly complemented his muscleman look. His tank top was practically glued to his broad, brawny body, His pecs jutted out from his chest like round, sculpted mountains, his back and shoulders spread wide to compensate for their size. His forearms were rugged and sinewy, while his upper arms were as large as his teenaged head. His waist was as wide as his chest and thick with muscle. To top it off, he was generously coated with a blanket of kinky hairs that bristled across his exposed skin from the back of his hands to his actual back. There was something ironic about how he had hair on every inch of his body except where he really should have it.<br />
<br />
38...39...40... He had reached his dad&#39;s age now, and they couldn&#39;t have looked any different. His father was a clean-cut businessman who wanted him to follow in his footsteps and by the looks of him, he was more of an outdoors man, someone who worked with his hands and took shit from nobody. Not that this was his real future, it was from the survey.<br />
<br />
Edwin noticed that his stomach was looking a little bloated, like he had overeaten at a buffet. It appeared he&#39;d reached the point where keeping trim was an uphill task, as his metabolism slowed to a crawl. His suspicions proved true as that small belly began to inflate like a water balloon, his tank top stretching and moulding itself to display its size. Edwin sighed deeply, he knew it was coming... He wrote it in his survey. At least, even with the growing belly, he still had arms like logs and pecs like watermelons. He could probably bench press a car without breaking a sweat. Edwin slightly grinned at the thought.<br />
<br />
47...48...49... Things were almost coming to an end now. White hairs were bristling through his short beard at a rapid pace as if he used to dye his facial hair until he had a change of heart and wanted to look his age. Much like the deep creases that burrowed across his huge forehead.<br />
<br />
Edwin noticed that the mirror in front of him was starting to turn blurry and unfocused. He blinked a few times until things come back to focus. A funny pair of nerdy glasses now perched on the bridge of his nose, magnifying the wrinkles and dark circles surrounding his eyes. They made him appear almost scholarly, were it not for his brutish body. His belly was overtly round and rested comfortably on his tree trunk-like thighs. His pecs had lost their perky roundness, now looking plump and saggy atop his large belly.<br />
<br />
More grey hairs made their presence known as his chest hair began to make the turn. Strangely enough, Edwin felt that the hair on his head grew out a couple of inches, leaving him with a horseshoe of salt and pepper hair that wrapped around the sides of his head. The top of his scalp was completely bare, glinting under the red light in the room. <br />
<br />
58...59...60... There was a tiny ding as the number finally reached its target. Edwin studied his mirror reflection with intrigue. &quot;I look like a hefty Santa Claus&quot;, he thought. He was disappointed that he went bald at an early age and he had lost his perfect 20/20 vision, and the less said about his ball gut the better. But he was a hell of a muscle bear, that was for sure. However, there was also an approachable, fatherly appeal to his bear-like appearance. A friendly man you could trust, yet could be fiercely protective and intimidating if you got on his wrong side.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least my clothes changed with me&quot; Edwin said in a booming voice that astounded him. &quot;Will I go to sound like this since now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin give his stomach a slap, surprised to find it&#39;s more hard than he expected. He glanced down and grinned. &quot;It&#39;s the biggest I can be&quot; he mumbled, placing both hands onto his enormous tree trunk thighs and feeling their heft. Then he noticed his beefy, hair coated forearms and rough, calloused hands, bringing them both up to his eyeline. &quot;I&#39;m basically a bear...&quot; He proceeded to reach up for his glasses, taking them off and squinting as his vision blurred. &quot;Aww man... This is so weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin tried to walk but he felt a little dizzy. He rubbed his beard between his fingers, feeling the coarse hairs. &quot;I need to get used to this...&quot; There was a pause as he massaged the top of his bald head, then he continued &quot;Maybe I should have picked dad&#39;s age instead. I&#39;m older than him now, it&#39;s weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, the door opened  and a grizzly bear came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Edwin. I was intrigued when you told me that you&#39;ll become bigger than me.&quot; Dawn the bear said. &quot;I&#39;m definitely bigger but you&#39;re very close. You look like a gorilla now! Hahaha!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Har har, At least I&#39;m not a furball, Dawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, really? You&#39;re more hair than human!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, then I&#39;ll be an ape man!&quot; Edwin proudly said and then he proceeded to beat his chest with his fists, accompanied by loud grunts.<br />
<br />
Dawn smiled at Edwin&#39;s monkey antics, happy to see that her brother wasn&#39;t embarrassed any more. She sling an arm around his shoulder and pull him down in a friendly wrestling, both of them grinning. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, now we finally changed. What are we going to do next, big brother?&quot;</p>
