<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“God…no.” whispered Jenn as she looked at the title of the paper.<br />
<br />
“The Bunny and the Fox: Lesbian Fury roleplay.” Read the paper which had to be five or six pages long and had her name at the top of the page along with, Alex. She turned around and saw her cheer squad teammate getting ready. She already had what looked to be somewhat like a playboy bunny outfit on only it was orange and white with a long fur covered tail attached to the end instead of a puffy tail. She was doing her hair in a mirror as beside adjusted a pair of fox ears. <br />
<br />
“Hurry up Jenn…we don’t want to be late.” Said Alex as she smiled showing fake pointed teeth in her mouth. <br />
<br />
“Sorry.” Said Jenn as she looked at the piece of clothing, high heels weren’t an issue, neither was the fish net stockings which up past her knees. The issue was the tight V crouch which was skin tight up to her breasts and was open back. The only reason it stayed on was the fish net stocking which went up from her breast line to a collar. Finger less gloves on the hands which went up to past her elbows. To finish everything there where the long ears and the puffy white tail. To make it worse the entire outfit was white and aside from the thicker materials around her pussy, ass crack and nipples was all but see through.<br />
<br />
“God help me.” Said Jenn as she was the last to leave the room and sat in the only empty desk trying not to focus on the talk about horse play which had just started or the fact that everyone was dressed like they were going to a sex party. It was by far the strangest class she had ever been in, everyone was presenting 5 minute speeches about their kink and then doing a 10 minute show. At first Jenn wondered how they where going to get through everyone and hoped her name was not going to get called, then she remembered this was a double period. She tried to push everything out of her mind as she began to read the paper, it was horrifying in her view and worse she recognized a lot of the writing style as her own, she had written this paper. After the paper was a detail break down of the show she and Alex would be putting on, aside from actual sexual contact it was lesbian sex.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer and Alex you two are up.” said the teacher as Alex stood up and headed toward one of the beds located along one of the walls of the class, Jennifer did a quick glance again at the paper before heading toward the front of the class standing at one corner of the bed. <br />
Alex started talking about the kink and the research into it, Jennifer gave some information as well but it was clear that Alex was taking control over the speech when normally Jennifer herself would be the one doing most of the talking. After about 7 minutes of having somewhat strange talk from Jen’s point of view and then it came to the practical part of their presentation. <br />
<br />
Being the “bunny” Jen’s role was to be the submissive prey to Alex “fox” but first she was to play hard to get so Alex could “hunt” her down. That part was easy for Jennifer to do but she could not avoid it for long and soon Alex had split her legs and while Jen’s back was off the bed, their heads along with their busts where touching each other.<br />
<br />
“I got you now.” Growled Alex as she then pulled Jenn into a kiss, now Jenn had never kissed another women before but somehow maybe it was muscle memory from whatever version of her used to call this world home took over as she returned the kiss. She didn’t put up any resistance as Alex put her hand on Jenn’s chest and pushed her down onto the bed and began to kiss down Jenn’s neck and chest. She wasn’t kissing her bar skin but the fabric, but the fabric was so thin it might as well not be there. Alex’s hands where also on her breasts and one on the thicker fabric of her womenhood which was now wet and Jen had to fight back a load moan.<br />
<br />
“Very good ladies.” Said the teacher as the kissing stopped and Alex smiled at her before getting up and helping Jen up. “Good show, and nice touch Jenn putting up as much resistance as you did. You are great as the dominate type but this shows you can work as the submissive type as well.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Jenn as she wished this day was over, then she remembered today was Thursday and that this arrange marriage show which happened on Saturday was only two days away.</p>
