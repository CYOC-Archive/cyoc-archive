<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     After leaving from your &quot;session&quot; you immediately head to Master Harauphar&#39;s room, greeting him and beginning your training. Master Harauphar either makes no mention or doesn&#39;t notice of the dampness around your crotch and the faint musky smell around you.<br />
<br />
     However as you two began your first magical training, other forces were at play. <br />
<br />
<br />
      Allen Voss hurriedly walked through the hallway on the ground floor of Lord Hugenstore&#39;s mighty inner castle. Even after several years of working as one of the posted guards in the castle, Allen was originally a country farmhand who dreamed of going to the big city and going on incredible adventures.<br />
<br />
   Though he quickly realized that the world already had enough adventurers and begrudgingly became a guard at the castle. While he did admit, being a guard was realatiy safe with good pay along with the fact he got training in combat he wouldn&#39;t have gotten anywhere else, he still felt ashamed for himself for not being able to follow his dreams.<br />
<br />
      Maybe I&#39;ll get my chance at fame in the next life. Allen thought to himself. Besides, who needed adventure when one could work for one of the mightiest military powers on the continent! With Lord Hugenstore&#39;s magical might, any rivals and enemies would have a tough time fighting him.<br />
<br />
           Allen gave himself a quick smirk as he began closing in on his destination. Allen&#39;s guard shift had just ended which meant that Allen would have to release a lot of the pent up stress he carried for a week or so.<br />
<br />
         Making sure no one was around, he inconspicuously opened a door leading to a cleaning cupboard where the janitors stored all of their equipment and gingerly locked the door, his own equipment starting to rise in anticipation for what came next. <br />
<br />
          Examining the room, he gave a small cough, unknowingly breathing in thousands of tiny purple spores that already would begin to take root in his body if he stayed in the small claustrophobic room for too long.<br />
<br />
         For what ever reason, a lot of the equipment had been thrown about in the small cupboard, brooms and buckets of cleaning solution were spilled over the floor as if someone tried to keep a large animal in here. Other than that, the only thing else that was unusual was the faint smell of sweet grapes in the room, though Allen quickly dismissed that thought.<br />
<br />
          Allen gave another excited smile and immediately began stripping, making sure to quietly take off all of his iron armor and safely placing his short sword on the ground even though he was well aware that the thick stone walls that encompassed every room essentially made the cupboard soundproof.<br />
<br />
     Allen then took off the remaining cloth clothing he wore, leaving him buck naked with his average sized penis erect and standing. Allen being a trained guard was muscular and fit but mostly average in any other regard.<br />
<br />
         The nearly invisible spores around him began to work their corrupting magic on Allen, working even faster as they had even more naked skin available. <br />
<br />
      Allen move to the corner of the room and using a small crowbar tucked away gently pried open the stone slab that secretly held his favorite toy.<br />
<br />
              The sound of moving stone filled the room as Allen grabbed the rough stone slab and placed it to the side, opening the small box that housed his fleshlight. <br />
<br />
    Allen had acquired it from an old clay worker who had personally guaranteed it would make his stress filled life more enjoyable. So far, Allen had to agree that the toy did just that.<br />
<br />
           Allen held the makeshift vagina in his hands, barely processing the smell of grapes that was omitted by the tool. He had always fancied that the first time his penis would be handled by something other than his hand would be the soft gentle hands of a countryside farm girl but it seemed like he had become too impatient for his own good.<br />
<br />
        Sitting down on the cold stone, Allen gently lowered the opening to his hard shaft, not knowing that if he did, the corrupted essence inside would change his life forever.<br />
<br />
     Allen gave a loud moan as he fet the toy devour his rod, and he couldn&#39;t retain his desires as he pumped his shaft heavily with the toy, the friction making him go mad as already his tool was beginning to leak his juice, his still human essence mixing and becoming infected by the essence of the kitsune Wraith. <br />
<br />
       By now as pleasure spiked through Allen&#39;s body, the corruption immediately began its assault on his body. Allen&#39;s eyes nearly rolled over in pleasure as the corruption gave him an intense wave of hedoistic joy. <br />
<br />
        His veins began turning color from a pale blue to a bright purple as his blood quickly became contaminated, spreading the disease to the still pure parts of his body. By now as his humped away at the flesh light, his tool already started changing in the image of Wraith the kitsune. His foreskin peeled away as his human member turned into a purple canine penis, his girth exploding in length and width, developing a knot and fitted sheath making his tool something only the most powerful of sexual beasts could enjoy.<br />
<br />
            His body began changing even more as the fleshlight milked his now canine cock harshly, his fingernails falling off and being replaced by razor sharp claws. His body hair increased exponentially, becoming a thick layer of wild fur that soon covered every single inch of him. His muscles expanded and burst into a new muscled version of themselves, legs becoming digitgrade and clawed as Allen developed a short muzzle that quickly filled itself with razor sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
           By now Allen was leaking even more corrupted semen, making it leak out of the fleshlight at massive rate.<br />
<br />
    Spongelike mushrooms began growing in his back, forming several clusters of fungal protrusions that began making their own spores.<br />
<br />
     By now Allen had realized his change but didn&#39;t even care as right now all he wanted was to fill this toy with as much of his essence as he could. Finally a mind blowing orgasm took a hold of him rocking his very core as he continued thrusting several bursts of semen into the toy, not stopping for several minutes before his pace began to slow down. <br />
<br />
       Allen panted like the dog like creature he was, removing his penis from the toy with an audible pop, releasing more of his essence to the grounds hitch by now was already stained by it.<br />
<br />
       The semen dried relatively quickly though Allen knew that it&#39;s corrupting effect still remaining.<br />
<br />
          Allen didn&#39;t know what he was but he now had a single desire. To find the one who made him like this. <br />
<br />
      Allen was not complete, deep in his corrupted mind he must find his master who blessed him with this gift and serve him for all eternity. He didn&#39;t know who his master was but he did know that his master was a canine creature like himself and that his Master had still not fully embraced his true Corruption yet. Allen&#39;s master must fully embrace his gift like Allen did, then they together would corrupt and expand their infection.<br />
<br />
        Allen wanted that, but he still had his old intelligence. Soon enough the mages of his former Lord Hugenstore would find out about the contamination here. Allen closing his eye could distantly sense his Master not too far away from where he was, but to try and meet him now would only result in both of their deaths.<br />
<br />
      Allen would leave the city, knowing he would have a hard time getting past the magical wards the surrounding the entire metropolis. <br />
<br />
        Then after leaving this place, he would await for his Master when he would eventually leave the city walls and have him fully embrace the gift. <br />
<br />
    Allen rummaged through his armor, taking only his sword sheathed within his scabbard and a special key that was given to all guards that gave access to several of the areas regular civilians were not allowed to go through as well as a satchel given to every guard that held basic necessities such as torches and some basic coinage.<br />
<br />
     Allen then grabbed he fleshlight smelling the musky odor that reminded him of grapes and held it to his mouth, drinking and favoring the tasty essence of himself and his master in it, he the decided to keep it, storing it in his guard&#39;s satchel as a reminder of how he was reborn into something more powerful.<br />
<br />
   Allen unlocked the door and making sure no one was near, bolted into the hallway, a flash of purple and black, making his way to the lower levels where he would be able to exit the city through the sewer system.</p>
