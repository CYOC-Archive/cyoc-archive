<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan was a woman who happened to be in her early 30s, where she lived with her husband Edward, and her toddler-aged son Zion. As Edward takes the responsibility of working for the family as a lawyer’s secretary for the legal department of TransDem Labs, Megan takes part of taking care of their son. They had a special bond with Zion since the moments he were born, as they loved her son very much. Megan would usually take them to the beach or go on fun places that seem to amuse him.<br />
<br />
On New Year’s Eve, just a few minutes before midnight, Megan and Edward were watching the TV together in the living room as they watched the New Year’s broadcast of Times Square. They put Zion to bed just a few hours ago, so they could have the moment to themselves in a romantic way. All while they were talking about their future. “The next year would be so much better after what happened recently.” Edward said. “Yeah, I agree. Hopefully we won’t have something as chaotic.” Megan responded. The ball then started to drop as people were counting down to the year. “I love you, baby.” Edward said as he approached her to kiss her. “I love you too.” She then got close to her husband, as the ball dropped to 0 as Edward and Megan were making out on the living room floor. They were unaware that people all around the world suddenly changed into babies as soon as the clock struck at midnight. Shortly after, they snuggled close to each other as they drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
In the morning, Megan woke up in a much more relaxing manner than usual. She felt more bubbly as her instincts felt like it was a wonderful day to explore. Moments after, she found herself being smaller and chubbier, with her baby fat coming back. Her skin felt much smoother as well. Beneath her waist was a diaper that had a purple koala around the tapes. She also noticed Edward being much younger as well, as he was still resting and wearing only a diaper around his waist like her. This made Megan curious on what was going on, as she picked up the remote that was above the couch and turned on the TV. <br />
<br />
Within a few seconds, the TV’s screen appeared to have the local news station airing. It appeared to have a couple two year old toddlers that were standing behind a large desk, a boy and a girl. The boy was a light skinned Latino where he had brown curly hair, while the girl had short blonde hair. Both were naked, as the desk hidden their diapers from view. The girl was currently speaking while holding a piece of paper to look official.<br />
<br />
“Those of who are tuning in, we have received breaking news. Around midnight on New Year’s Eve, every adult in the world has mysteriously found themselves as babies.” The girl reporter said in a babyish voice. “That’s right, Emily. It seems though as every baby in the world have somehow become intelligent enough to talk like an adult.” The latino boy announced with a lisp. “The president is willing to make an official address towards the nation later this afternoon.” The girl paused for a moment before continuing. “In other news, the economy has shifted from people buying diapers and other baby items around the world. It also shows that more cartoons have been watched more than most shows in streaming services. We now go to Jazmine for the weather.” <br />
<br />
“Thank you, Amy.” The camera then panned towards another girl who only wore nothing but a purple bow, a cute shirt with a happy cloud and sun, and a diaper. “We will be experiencing scattered thunderstorms..” The weathergirl said before she was suddenly interrupted by a loud gurgling noise. The cameraboy lightly chuckled as the girl blushed and placed her hands on her grumbly stomach. “Ehehe. Speaking of storms, there’s a storm brewing in my bowels right now.” She said as she was smiling a bit before she was in a slight squatting position. A few audible grunts escaped through the girl’s glossy lips as her diaper began to sag and turn brown. It didn’t take long for the crew to realize what was happening.<br />
<br />
By the time the weathergirl was finished, her diaper seemed quite full. She briefly let out a sign of relief and tried to continue giving the weather report like normal before she accidentally slipped and sat on her mushy diaper. Her instincts had her giggle as she felt comfortable around her warm seat. After a few moments, she stood up feeling a bit embarrassed. “Can I have someone here change me?” She requested before another toddler, who wore just a shirt and a diaper, as they quickly helped the other baby onto a cute little changing mat. He then undid the adhesive tabs and pulled down the front of the diaper, as the person manning the camera zoomed in to look. The news then went straight to commercial before the toddler’s mess was revealed.</p>
