<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on hon we need to get to the mall&quot; She smiled. They were going out for some mother and daughter shopping. There wouldn&#39;t be many more opportunities for things like this, her daughter was going off to college soon. She had gotten a full academic scholarship to Stanford.<br />
&quot;Come on Miss Knowitall&quot; Susan laughed as Melony came down the stairs<br />
&quot;MOM&quot; Melony just rolled her eyes at her &quot;Let’s go&quot;<br />
Susan and Melony drove to the mall, parked and went in. &quot;Where to first? What do you need for Stanford?&quot;<br />
&quot;Everything, let’s start with some outfits though.&quot; They went from store to store trying on outfits, some of the outfits Susan considered inappropriate but Melony was an adult now. She shuddered as she imagined her daughter coming back from college break wearing skimpy outfits, tattoos, piercings and a pink hair. A few comments of &quot;are you sure&quot; and &quot;that is awfully short&quot; were met with eye rolls and &quot;don&#39;t be old fashion Mom.&quot;<br />
Next was swimsuits, backpack, hats........<br />
The day went on they had lunch at the food court and Susan was feeling a little tired but she wanted to enjoy as much time with Melony as she could. So she soldiered on from store to store trying on outfits herself and watching Melony try on stuff. <br />
Finally towards the end of the day with their arms loads Susan asked &quot;Is that all you needed?&quot; really wanting to go home now.<br />
&quot;No, I think I need some new shoes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Honey, your closet is full of shoes. You can&#39;t fit that much into your dorm room.&quot;<br />
&quot;But that is why I need new shoes, some shoes that go with everything.&quot; Not really finding a flaw in that flimsy logic so she relented and headed over to the shoe section.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start with so sneakers, you could use a new pair too Mom.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, hon. I have a good pair&quot;<br />
&quot;No really Mom the pair you have is ancient and you shouldn&#39;t wear them in public anymore especially around me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, I sorry&quot; Susan said with as much sarcasm put in as she could &quot;I would hate to embarrass you.&quot;<br />
Grabbing a box at random she grabbed a bench to try them on.<br />
&quot;Oh, hahaha&quot; Susan opened the box and pulled out a pair of size 22 bright red clown shoes. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, god no, Mom. It would be sooo embarrassing.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no. They will look good on me&quot; Susan enjoying her daughter’s embarrassment. She slipped on the shoes and walked up to her daughter.<br />
&quot;No, mom. Get away from me. I don&#39;t want to be seen with you.&quot; Susan laughed the shoes were big and made her walk funny but they felt great.<br />
&quot;I think I will buy these&quot;<br />
&quot;God, Mom. You are such a goof&quot; Melony was turning a shade of red. &quot;Let’s go home&quot;<br />
&quot;But you still need shoes&quot; Susan smiled at the quick change<br />
&quot;No, you are right. I have enough shoes at home, let’s just go&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, let me just buy these&quot; Melony just rolled her eyes and raced to the exit to the store. Susan went up to the register and bought them. The clerk was surprised at the shoes; he never knew that they had anything like it.<br />
&quot;Ok, let’s go&quot; As she took her still red and embarrassed daughters arm and headed for the mall exit.  <br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you bought those things&quot; Susan just laughed as they walked to the car; her feet were starting to hurt though.<br />
&quot;Well, I am glad you want to head home my feet are starting to hurt from all the walking. Maybe I should have bought a new pair these seem a bit small.&quot; <br />
<br />
As they drove home they passed a line of cars across the street. &quot;Oh, Betty must be having her birthday party. You have to go over and wish her a happy birthday, she well miss you while you are gone at college.&quot; They got home and threw down their purchases down. Susan flopped on the couch and took of her shoes massaging her feet.<br />
&quot;I going to go out with my friends for a while, they are less embarrassing.&quot; This time it was Susan&#39;s turn to roll her eyes as Melony went out the door.<br />
&#39;I really should have bought some new shoes, those are way too small.&#39; thought Susan as she rubbed her sore feet. She took the clown shoes out of the box and looked at them.<br />
&#39;What am I going to do with these things now?&#39; she turned the shoes in her hands; they did feel good when she wore them. She slipped them over her feet and sighed in bliss as the feeling of them washed over her. Feeling a bit silly she leaned back, relaxed and enjoyed the feeling of them, giggling to herself every once in a while. The feeling was spreading to her ankles and moving up her calves. Suddenly more energetic she got up and started to put her purchases away, giggling at the smallest things but feeling great. It was weird waddling around in the clown shoes but it was wonderfully silly and fun as the feeling crept up her legs. She finished putting away the clothes and stood there bouncing on the toes of the clown shoes trying to figure out something else to do. She laughed, she felt great her sense were alive with everything seeming brighter more colorful, a sweet smell filled the house like cotton candy. The smell wafting through the house convinced her to start some cookies. She made up the dough, spread some flour out and began to roll out the dough. She wiped her hands on her jeans and felt her butt. Her butt was different she turned and look at her reflection in the oven door and noticed her butt seemed bigger. She ran her hands over it and marveled at the feeling it produced, it was softer and bigger and she liked it. The feeling had spread to her stomach and in her reflection that even though her butt seemed bigger her hips and stomach seemed to shrink to a sexier hourglass figure. She wondered if the shoes just lifted up her butt and stomach and they just seemed this way or not, but either way she liked it. Turning back to her work she cut out the cookies and began to decorate them, having a bit of trouble looking down on them on the counter. Her bra was hurting, god how she hated bras, she could never find one that fit right but the feeling had spread upward from her stomach to her chest. She reached behind herself and lifted up the back of her shirt to undo the bra. She didn&#39;t notice that her back was snow white and if she had looked everything except her arms and neck up was snow white and it was creeping up. She unclipped her bra and her breasts spilled out, she got her arms out of it and threw the bra to the side as she put the cookies in the oven. She closed the oven and caught her reflection, she looked great, her tits seemed bigger along with her butt and a better figure. She laughed and continued to laugh uncontrollably. She collapsed on the floor laughing and giggling and caught herself with her arms and saw finally the white that was creeping up her body. She felt the tingles go down her arms and up her head, she saw her arms turn white which should have scared her but she just laughed harder. Curled up on the ground her pants split as her butt grew larger, the white spread upwards to her whole head. Her shirt tented even more as her breasts expanded and her scalp tingled and from the roots her hair turned a dark shade of green and form in to two pigtails tie with pink bows. Her smile became permanent as her lips turned red and plumped up turning upward. Small clusters of red heart shaped freckles formed on her cheeks. Her eyebrows disappeared and became high blue arches and as she blinked her eyelashes grew longer.<br />
Melony came home feeling a little guilty about ditching her mother. She walked in and the smell of cookies baking in the oven hit her along with another sweet smell she did not know. She giggled not really knowing why she kicked off her shoes and called out &quot;Mom, you here&quot; She inhaled deeply enjoying the smell and giggled more.<br />
&quot;Mom where are you&quot; Hearing her mom in the kitchen she started to walk there laughing more and more unable to stop herself she felt a tingle start to grow all over. Walking into the kitchen laughing uncontrollably she heard her mother laughing too and turned to see her on the floor curled up. <br />
*giggle* &quot;Mom?&quot; *giggle* &quot;What happened&quot; *hahaha* &quot;you look like a silly clown&quot; *giggle* Susie was curled up on the floor in a yellow dress, pink petticoat, rainbow stocking and the red clown shoes. *laugh* &quot;I know Melody&quot; *haha* &quot;I feel so silly&quot; *laugh. Melony collapsed on the floor with her mother her skin slowly turning pale, a smile spreads over her face as her lips plump up and turn red. Her brown hair turning a shade of pink that her mom feared and curling around her face in a bob haircut. As her skin slowly faded to pure white her eyebrows disappeared and purple wavy lines replaced them higher on her forehead and a blush formed on her cheeks. Her feet shot out and a pair of purple mary jane high heels formed around them as her clothes changed into a yellow and purple very short shorts and midriff revealing top.<br />
*giggle* &quot;You look silly now too&quot; *giggle*<br />
*haha* &quot;Mom, we have to stop this&quot; *haha* Melony screamed panicking.<br />
Susie hugged her daughter &quot;Its ok my little knowitall I will help get rid of all those thoughts&quot; She placed her mouth to her ear and blew, pink bubbles flew out of the other ear as knowledge and her IQ dropped considerably. Feeling the loss but not knowing why anymore she automatically reaches up and trys to grab them to get them back. *pop* each one goes as she touches it. *laugh* &quot;Just relax and enjoy being silly now, Melody&quot; *laugh. Melody lies back giggling staring vacantly up at the ceiling, the academic scholar now probably unable to pass middle school. With an audible pop both of their noses inflated to round balls a pink glittering one for Melody and a purple one for Susie. Their minds popping as well as memories flew outward and burst and new ones replaced them.<br />
The oven dings and both of them hop up and Susie pulls them out of the oven. Melody get a dreamy look on her face as she smells the cotton candy scent from the cookies. Melody helped her mother take the pink heart shaped cookies off the pan and on to cooling racks. <br />
&quot;These are my famous silly hearts guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Who should we give them too?&quot;</p>
