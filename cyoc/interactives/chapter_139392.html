<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary Elise couldn’t help but grin as she stared at the statue of Claudia. She had transformed a very powerful sorceress completely to stone, proving she truely had great power within her. Unfortunately she had also shocked and worried her friend.<br />
<br />
“Mary what the hell,” Karen exclaimed. “Did you really have to do that?!”<br />
<br />
“She wanted to see my power and I showed her,” she smirked. “Nothing wrong with that and look it just shows how much power I have. I bet I could even defeat that sorceress Morgan LeFay.” Karen downed as she glared at Mary Elise. The girl was letting the power go to her head now, which wasn’t a good thing. Mary Elise didn’t have the greatest confidence in the world and had always felt powerless. Giving a sad, angry girl power could corrupt the person and make them into a legitimate threat to innocent people. As Karen was mulling things over she turned to the statue, something seemed wrong. Claudia wasn’t changing back.<br />
<br />
“Mary why is she still a statue?”<br />
<br />
“I may have put a little bit more juice into that spell than intended,” she said meekly. “I don’t think she’ll be able to break it anytime soon.” Karen watched as a devilishly look came over Mary Elise’s face. Slowly the auburn haired teen approached the statue. “What are you doing now Mary,” Karen asked. Mary Elise turned back towards her friend smiling impishly. “Well I want to borrow her pendant,” she smirked. “I mean if I were to add it to my own magic then maybe I can handle this evil sorceress problem without getting the others involved. Who knows, I might actually be the hero in the end.”<br />
<br />
Karen stared aghast as Mary’s Elise now tried to free the woman’s necklace from around her stone neck. Before she could though the two teens were blown backwards by a powerful force. Landing in a heap Karen now turned towards her friend who was wincing in pain. “Mary you Okay?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise nodded, wincing from whatever had blown the two backwards as she turned back towards the statue she was shocked to see herself standing next to Claudia.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise (the college aged Mary Elise) had heard Claudia’s cry for help. The 20 year old had been studying when she could clearly hear her old friend cry out in fear at what was happening. Despite the distance growing between the two lately she couldn’t let anything bad happen to her. Quickly touching her pendant she felt herself wisked  away to somewhere, where she was shocked to see a teenage version of herself and a statue of her best friend.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on here,” she bellowed glaring at the two teens. “And what have you done to Claudia?”<br />
<br />
Karen shrank back in fear as Mary Elise slowly got to her feet, glaring angrily at her older self. “She wanted to see my power and I showed her. How about you? Care to see how you fare?” Karen could only gasp as Mary raised her ring towards her older self. Unfortunately for the teen it appeared this version of Mary Elise was no fool. Quickly waving her hand she watched as the teen was thrown to the ground. A blow that knocked the wind out of the teen but did no lasting damage.<br />
<br />
“Look I don’t know what your problem is kid and personally I don’t care. If you make another move towards me and my friend though you’ll find out that I am not someone to be messed with.”<br />
<br />
The teen could only growl as the college age Mary Elise turned to examine her friend. “Don’t worry Claud I got you,” she said. Placing a hand on her pendant Mary Elsie touched the statue Claudia. Slowly the stone once again began to turn to flesh. As Claudia unfroze she collapsed to the ground gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
“Mary,” she wheezed. “What happened? How did you get here?”<br />
<br />
“You called,” Mary grinned. “I heard your voice calling for help. You sounded scared.” Claudia tried to compose herself as she slowly rose to her feet. She didn’t quite remember exactly what happened but was thankful for the assist. Sadly her ego wouldn’t admit that she had been in trouble.“That doesn’t sound like something I would do,” She frowned, causing her friend to stifle a laugh. “Fine Claudia,” Mary Elise smiled. “Let’s just say I wanted to see you. Now what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Claudia now tried to piece her memories together. She recalled the teenage Mary Elise casting a spell, one that Claudia was foolish enough to think she could handle after lowering her defenses. Unfortunately the girl was stronger than she thought. Claudia had for all intents and purposes become a statue. As her mind had begun to solidify she had felt fear. She had seen the teenager trying to remove the pendant, if the girl had done that she most likely would of been stuck like that forever. It was at that moment her instincts had called out for help.<br />
<br />
Claudia now angrily stared at the teens, feeling her cheeks flush with anger. “Well your evil twin over there tried to take my necklace after I let her try her magic on me.” Mary Elise frowned as she slowly approached the teens. Glaring angrily at her teenage self she was determined to get answers. “Talk,” she stated.<br />
<br />
“I was just going to try it out for a moment,” the teenage Mary Elise grumbled. “I wasn’t going to keep it, I would of given it back eventually.”<br />
<br />
“Bull,” the adult Mary’s Elise said flatly. “I may not know what’s going on here but I know when I’m lying. And judging by the look on..well...my face, you were up to something. So tell me what I need to know before I let my hot tempered friend show off what her power can do.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise looked between the two college girls, noticing how angry they looked. Although she was trying to maintain an air of defiance, deep down she was terrified. The college girl in front of her was her and apparently a very powerful sorceress in her own right. Now that Claudia was free as well she could see an anger in the woman that she had never seen in her Claudia. Gulping quickly she realized she had let her ambition and desire for power blind her to how dark she had been acting.<br />
<br />
“Okay I screwed up,” she whispered. “I...I wanted the necklace to gain more power and defeat Morgan LeFay.”<br />
<br />
“Why though,” Claudia exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise could only sigh in defeat, her shoulders slumping as she looked towards the ground. “I just wanted Kellie and the others to like me.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the adult Mary Elise said. “Two questions. One who the hell is Morgan LeFay and two why is their a teenage me in my yard,” Claudia grinned as she slowly got to her feet, still somewhat disoriented from her brief time as a statue. “Mary it’s a long story. One that we are going to have to ask Katie about when we get back home, for now though let me catch you up on things. Oh and one more thing, thanks for having my back.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled as she gave her friend a hug. “What are best friends for,” she whispered as the two began to talk.</p>
