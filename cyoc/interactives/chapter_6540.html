<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All on the way back to her apartment, I wondered what I was going to do.  My thoughts drifted back to my earlier thoughts.  It had been at least 6 months since I had a really strong desire to be a woman.  I had thought that I was finally putting it all behind me.  That’s what my group of friends really helped me do.  We were all kind of an unofficial therapy group for each other.  We all wanted to be women, but by meeting we were able to talk about our feelings, and we were finally starting to realize that we had to except reality and act like men.  In fact, I was supposed to meet with them tonight.  How was I supposed to explain all of this to them?<br />
<br />
I decided that I needed some kind of resolution to my feelings before we made it to Kristy’s apartment.  I looked to the ring for my answers.  I didn’t want Kristy to hear me, so I hoped that the ring would work if I just thought a wish.  I wished that I could see through the overcoat she was wearing.  Suddenly the fabric of the coat became transparent.  I could quite clearly see her naked figure, but I could also see the outlines of the coat, and its color faintly.  <br />
<br />
Walking behind her, I fixated my gaze on her ass.  It was everything a female’s ass is supposed to be: round, firm, without blemish.  I thought that if Kristy were an actress, most people would talk about her ass as her most obvious feature.  Kind of like Jennifer Lopez, I thought.  <br />
<br />
Kristy also had nice, long legs.  They were well toned, and even appeared to be somewhat muscular.  She must have worked out, I thought.  Her gorgeous blonde hair extended down to the middle of her back.  Or, at least, that’s what I thought since her hair wasn’t pressing directly against her body.  I looked at her arms swaying back and forth.  Much like her legs, they appeared toned and somewhat muscled.  She certainly wouldn’t be mistaken for a bodybuilder, but she was definitely fit.<br />
<br />
Just then, it occurred to me of whom Kristy reminded me.  Since I tried to convince myself that I was a male, I decided to subscribe to Playboy.  The latest issue featured wrestling “diva” Torrie Wilson.  I had studied her pictures out of admiration for her figure, rather than out of lust.  Looking at Kristy’s form, from behind anyway, she very much reminded me of Torrie.  I had to get a look at her front.<br />
<br />
“We’re here,” Kristy said, leading us to a worn, gray building.  “Not much to look at, I should warn you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you don’t have to apologize for anything,” I said.  Indeed, I was the one who needed to apologize.<br />
<br />
We walked into the lobby and headed for the elevator.  She got in first and finally I was treated to a view of her naked front.  I got into the elevator and stood at her side.  I tried my best to make it look like I wasn’t staring at her, but I found it hard to do.  I was able to make out that she had perfect breasts.  They weren’t too big, nor were they too small.  Her nipples were erect, probably from not being covered from the cool, spring air.  Her areolas were also sized perfectly.  Thinking back to the pictures of Torrie Wilson, Kristy’s nipples and areolas were bigger.  <br />
<br />
The elevator bell dinged at the third floor and I let Kristy lead the way.  We came to her apartment, numbered 319.  She unlocked the door and led me straight in.  She turned back to face me, and now I was able to get a better look at her unclothed form.  Her breasts looked fantastic from straight on.  I glanced down to between her legs and saw that she was a natural blonde.  I also took notice of the fact that she kept her pubic hair trimmed in one thin, neat line, centered perfectly leading to her pussy.<br />
<br />
“Just give me a minute to throw some clothes on, and I’ll be right back,” she said.<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  I hoped that she didn’t notice I was staring at her.  Then again, she had no way of knowing I could see through the coat.  Even so, it wasn’t exactly polite.<br />
<br />
“Here, you can sit on the couch,” she said with a slight giggle, sensing that I was a little too nervous to move.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” I said, sounding more than a little nervous.  Indeed my hands felt like I had been running them under a faucet for a minute or two.  I could feel perspiration under my arms and against my chest too.  As I sat on the couch and Kristy presumably went to her bedroom, I noticed that the perspiration was evident on the front of my shirt.  No wonder she laughed.<br />
<br />
What was I going to do once she came back out?</p>
