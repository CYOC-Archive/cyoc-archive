<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane was relieved to have kept her consciousness and stopped her transformation into a zebra, but she was too horny and her zebra dick was extremely hard. She knew she would have to work this out, but she couldn&#39;t do that in front of her children. She tried to run to a reserved place, but Susan was in the way and jumped on her knocking her down.<br />
<br />
Daniel, seeing his mother being knocked down by the lion that was his sister, realized that Susan had a hard-on again and that, by his movements, he was going to fuck their mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Susan, Don&#39;t Fuck Mom.&quot; Daniel said, but his sister didn&#39;t understand human language at the time and it had no effect. He thought his mother would resist, but she didn&#39;t do anything and just agreed to have her zebra ass penetrated by her daughter&#39;s cock. &quot;Mom, do something. You can&#39;t let Susan fuck you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry but she&#39;s too strong for me to escape. I&#39;m embarrassed that we&#39;re doing this in front of you, but I&#39;m also so horny I even feel that deep down inside I want her to fuck me.&quot; Jane said, accepting to be fucked by the lion that was her daughter<br />
<br />
Daniel was embarrassed, watching his sister fuck his mother&#39;s ass on the living room floor, meanwhile Jane strocked her cock. <br />
<br />
It took a few minutes for Susan to come inside her mother, which led Jane to come too. After this orgasm Susan began a new transformation, his front legs became arms and hands, indicating that he had started to get back to normal. His muzzle retracted into a nose and Daniel&#39;s sister regained her consciousness.<br />
<br />
Confused, Susan looked around and saw her mother partially transformed into a zebra under her, as well as the lion body she still had, but the biggest shock to her was that she had a dick and it was into her mother&#39;s ass. She looked at you and said &quot;I felt weird talking to you and I don&#39;t remember anything after that. What happened after that, why am I fucking mommy and why is she half a zebra?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you&#39;re back to normal Susan. You turned into a lion for eating the cursed cookies a witch handed me. You weren&#39;t aware of what you were doing while you were a lion with hormones running high and you fucked Mom shortly after she faced the new transformation the curse was causing her.&quot; Daniel said to his sister<br />
<br />
&quot;So it was your fault that this happened to me, and you had to involve Mom in it.&quot; Susan said, finally taking her cock out of her mother and trying to get up, but she couldn&#39;t because her body was still quadruped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to be mad at him Susan, Daniel didn&#39;t bring the cursed cookies on purpose and we were the ones who ate it without knowing the consequences. And you don&#39;t have to worry about having fucked me up, I kind of liked it.&quot; Jane said<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though you liked it I still don&#39;t think I should have done it.&quot; Susan said but she noticed her cock was still hard and she was very horny. &quot;Since you are responsible for this, you will have to shoulder your responsibilities.&quot; she said to Daniel and went for him, who tried to escape but wasn&#39;t fast enough against his sister&#39;s current body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Susan, don&#39;t do th...&quot; Daniel tried to say but was interrupted by his sister&#39;s cock, which she stuffed in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan, don&#39;t force your brother to suck your cock. He did make a mistake, but you don&#39;t have to be so hard on him.&quot; Jane said to her dauther<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t come up with this idea mom. It&#39;s because you spoil him so much that we&#39;re cursed because of something he did to a witch, he has to be punished and this is the best option I can find. And you also can&#39;t deny that you&#39;re enjoying what you see.&quot; Susan said to her mom, who was slowly stroking her zebra dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Oh, what a shame. I shouldn&#39;t do this in front of my kids.&quot; Jane said and left the place, going to the bathroom and locking herself there to masturbate. Susan continued to fuck her brother&#39;s mouth until the wave and another orgasm filled her lion body, which held his head making him swallow all her cum.<br />
<br />
After this orgasm Susan&#39;s body changed again, loud cracks could be heard as her back leg joints readjusted, as well as her hips which became able to allow her to stand on two legs again. Her musculature lost definition and her breasts grew back on her chest. When she felt that she had stopped changing she had practically gone back to being a human, but she still had her body covered in hair and her mane wrapped around her head, as well as her lion&#39;s tail and cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, just a little longer and I&#39;m back to normal completely.&quot; Susan said<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan, you are so mean, you made me choke on your cum.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not done yet, your punishment will still continue.&quot; Susan said and ran out of the living room, only to return seconds later with the jar containing the cursed cookies. &quot;These cookies were first given to you, but apparently you didn&#39;t eat any yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be wanting me to eat one of them, can you?&quot; Daniel asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to eat, and I&#39;m going to make sure you do.&quot; Susan said, opening the jar and taking one of the cookies, then forcing it into her brother&#39;s mouth, which he was forced to swallow. &quot;Now you&#39;re cursed too, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you become a horny animal too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan cell phone then informed her that she had just received a message. She read the message and then said &quot;It can&#39;t be, my boyfriend is coming to get me. He can&#39;t see me like this.&quot; </p>
