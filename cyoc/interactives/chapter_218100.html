<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">April couldn&#39;t help but feel off. like there was something not quite right. Perhaps it was due to her dream. in it, she was surrounded by spirit animals. the main reason she could tell was they were all slightly transparent.  <br />
<br />
then a large elephant approached her. She should have been frightened. instead, she felt at ease. it was as if this creature could help rid her of her unease from the mall. the elephant didn&#39;t stop moving, soon it passed through her body and that was when she woke up.  <br />
<br />
she got a text from Bets about not feeling good. she replied that it might have been the foreign-sounding food they tried at the food court. she didn&#39;t notice the color seemed to slowly drain out of her skin. the African American girl stood in front of her mirror and styled her hair. She was only half African American of course. her father was from Wisconsin.  <br />
<br />
She smiled as she put the finishing style on her short messy hair. &quot;can&#39;t have a bedhead. Man do I envy guys for being able to pull this off&quot; she said aloud. Akius grinned as he watched April change. she was completely unaware he was spying on her through the mirror.  <br />
<br />
he watched as the last of her skin pigment changed. she now had grey skin covering her body. not only that but he had witnessed her shoulder-length hair shift into a short tomboy style. he hadn&#39;t guessed that the spirit animals had been male till he watched their transformations. he had gotten lucky with this one.  <br />
<br />
the others had gained a bit of magic. &quot;suppose I should stop casting spells in anger&quot; he said to himself. he had done this before. let&#39;s just say that the clock tower now had an extra gargoyle. he then saw she was moving away from her mirror.  <br />
<br />
back in April&#39;s house, she was busy getting dressed. she took off her pajamas and put on some fashionable clothes. her mom was a fashion designer (originally a store clerk). there were some articles of clothing missing. her feet were bare of any cloth or shoes.  <br />
<br />
the same could be said for her chest. all her bras had vanished. this left her large d cup breasts to hang freely. She rubbed her flat stomach as it growled. She walked out of her room and down the stairs.  <br />
<br />
she smelled something good through her large nostrils. her nose longer than most humans. setting in her seat she saw her mom cooking breakfast. Celia glanced as she heard her daughter approach. &quot;hey Aly I see you&#39;re feeling better&quot; she said as she made her famous banana pancakes.  <br />
<br />
this was one of the few things the wizards curse had not altered. no matter the issue of the day. Aly&#39;s mother would always make the pancake for them. As they were eating their chest and crotch felt tingling.  <br />
<br />
they scratched their shrinking c cup breasts as they spread their legs a little. &quot;you OK?&quot; their mother asked as they changed. &quot;yeah but just to be safe ill stay home for a while&quot; they said as they used their trunk to hold their fork. as they were talking Adam began looking down instead of up. his mother while standing was still dwarfed by her 8&#39;10 son.  <br />
<br />
She sighed as she spoke &quot;I hope it&#39;s not another growth spurt. You won&#39;t fit in the house anymore if so&quot;. &quot;don&#39;t worry Himesh said if that happens he&#39;ll use some size-altering spell or something&quot; he leaned back on the chair Brotyn had made. he was thankful with all his muscles his weight would be too much for normal furniture. his chest was soon pushed out by manly pecs.  <br />
<br />
he then scratched his balls as he felt more comfortable. &quot;OK but he better get better at that spell. he still hasn&#39;t fixed the size of the tree out there&quot; she said as she left for work. passing by a miniature tree in the middle of the yard. a tiny swing attached to it.  <br />
<br />
&#39;well if I&#39;m not going anywhere&#39; he thought as he headed to the basement. where there were once cardboard boxes was now a large workout center. he had installed this single-handily (in his mind at least). he wanted a hobby that would keep both his brain and brawn sharp. he planted his round feet as nails became circular.  <br />
<br />
he went to his personal changing booth and came out. he now wore a white muscle shirt and black shorts. he grinned as it showed off the large bulge between his legs. he didn&#39;t know why but it felt amazing to see it today. his large balls hung to his knees.  <br />
<br />
his cock was 35 inches when hard. Even soft it left a noticeable bulge. he patted it with his large hands. he began working out and sweating. sweat was not the only thing coming out.  <br />
<br />
Black hairs grew over his body. it was thickest on his chest and ran down his massive gut to his bush and sack. he flapped his giant ears as he trumpeted in triumph. he had just done his workout. now he headed upstairs.  <br />
<br />
his tail almost getting caught in the door. he smiled as he looked at his manor. butlers and maids making it look good for the party tonight. Finally Aakesh or Ake for short gained those iconic tusks of his. Akius was slack-jawed.  <br />
<br />
he knew the spell would alter their lives. but to go from an average American family to the richest people in town. composing himself he spoke, &quot;OK next time be specific in one&#39;s curses&quot;. he realized that his curse had gotten out of hand. in his desire to see those girls changed he had forgotten to specify it would be negative.  <br />
<br />
all he saw were improvements to their lives. not to mention their odd names now. he glanced in on the final girl. She had slept in the longest so her change would be last.</p>
