<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, it feels a bit weird to do, but I can get behind doing a little bit of RP. Fine, you can be Jenny. But that means that I get to be Jeff&quot; announced the real Jenny, now Jeff. <br />
<br />
Jenny looked over her shoulder and up at her boyfriend&#39;s face with a smile. &quot;I am fine with that, Jeff&quot; She said whike panting as she continued to ride the high of her recent orgasm. She leaned back against Jeff&#39;s chest, feeling it&#39;s sturdiness supporting her body with ease. She was definitely extremely short in comparison to Jeff, but that allowed her to do things like this. <br />
<br />
She wrapped her arms around Jeff&#39;s arm that was holding her close to him with a finger still in her pussy. It felt massive, strong, and very comforting. Jenny knew her boyfriend would always protect her and wouldn&#39;t harm her, so she willingly decided to let herself become swept up by any and all of his whims. Complete and total submission. It felt so good to decide to do this that Jenny nearly came again. But her mind was made up now. As long as Jeff wanted it, she would do it, happily and without question. <br />
<br />
&quot;You alright there Jenny?&quot; Asked Jeff while he looked down and ran his hand through her long hair. Jenny nodded silently, then she wrapped around his arm even more as he began to move his finger inside of her once again. Jenny didn&#39;t even try to hold back her moaning now, and actually became very vocal about her enjoyment. Praising her boyfriend inbetween moans became a common pattern which started to slightly bug Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I get you love me and all, but you can just enjoy this. You don&#39;t need to keep praising me. It&#39;s kind of making me feel a bit weird actually&quot; suggested Jeff. Jenny took this way more seriously however and immediately began apologizing for overly praising him. Jeff had to stop pleasuring Jenny just to focus more on calming her down after this and felt that perhaps things may have gone a bit too far by now. <br />
<br />
Jenny may be cute as hell, and somehow everything he could ever desire in a woman, but this was all just meant to be a bit of loving RP, not the real deal. And as things are now, Jenny is way to immersed into her character. And to a dangerous level at that. Jeff liked being dominant, sure. But he doesn&#39;t want a &quot;yesman&quot; for a girlfriend. Her being small and submissive is great, but not at the point where she stops being a normal person like this and begins to worship him like her God or something. That&#39;s too submissive. <br />
<br />
So Jeff stands up out of the bath and dried the both of them off a bit. Then, with Jenny being carried into the air by just one arm with his finger still inside her, he walked out of the bathroom and back over to the chronivac. He sat her down on the floor for a moment and took a seat himself at the desk. <br />
<br />
For starters, Jenny couldn&#39;t be left this submissive. So he dialed her back a bit. She would still be completely incapable of being dominant, but only towards him, and only durring sex, or when she wants to be. Aside from those times, Jenny will be able to think and act for herself again. <br />
<br />
Then Jeff noticed a button next to Jenny&#39;s name. Hovering over it, the tip stated that clicking it would officially swap the name with their registered partner. So Jeff clicked it. Now Jenny really was called Jenny, and he was actually called Jeff. So no more RP&#39;ing as each other. <br />
<br />
Jeff kept looking through Jenny&#39;s profile when he sees a check box for toggling on and off &quot;adaptive alterations&quot;. The tip stated that this would prompt Jeff with an option to make a change about Jenny, whenever she did or said anything that could be done by the Chronivac. For example, if durring a conversation she mentions something about wishing she was a red head, an option to change her into a red head would appear in Jeff&#39;s view. Or if she was feeling a like their latest kink has run its course, an input box would appear for Jeff to give her a new kink. This setting option actually seemed to be quite useful, so Jeff turned it on too. Jeff felt like this was good for now and saved the changes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uwahhh, I&#39;m freezing here Jeff. Can I at least put on some clothes or something?&quot; Asked Jenny who still is obediently sitting on the floor where Jeff set her down. An input box popped up in Jeff&#39;s view asking him if how to solve her cold issue. He could also close out of it if he didn&#39;t want to change anything, but wanted to test it out.<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about it, then decided to make Jenny always at a comfortable temperature, and prefer to always be naked whenever she could be because of it. When he confirmed the change, Jenny paused for a moment, then began to shake like a dog, splattering water droplets everywhere as she dried herself off. Her long hair now was the only part left on her that still was wet from their bath.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even bother covering herself up anymore casually walked over to stand right beside Jeff. She kissed him, then pouted cutely as she realized that even while sitting down in a chair, Jeff still was an inch taller than her. &quot;I feel so short standing next to you, ya know. Like, I get I am already short to begin with, but your tallness just seems to add to it. Not that I dislike you being tall, I love it actually. But its a little frustrating not even being at equal heights when you are sitting down. I wish I could stand just a little taller sometimes.&quot; Calmly said Jenny.<br />
<br />
This prompted an input box which Jeff didn&#39;t pass up on. If Jenny wanted to stand a little taller on occasion, he knew of a perfect way for her to do just that. He gave her a new background of attending rigorous ballet lessons since she was 3 until her boobs became too big and began bouncing too much and throwing her off during spins and leaps. She quit of her own volition, but kept practicing one specific skill she had developed a real talent for. Walking while standing up on the tips of her toes. <br />
<br />
Jeff made her enjoy doing it as a hobby, to the point that it became easier to walk like that than to walk flatfooted. Due to this change, Jenny would become an avid owner of numerous kinds of ballet heels, as they are now the only comfortable shape for footwear she can find. She would even at one point have a custom made pair of slippers in this style. <br />
<br />
Liking this, Jeff sent it through and watched Jenny rise up by about 7 inches as her feet and legs became encased in a shiny black pair of crotch high ballet boots. <br />
<br />
Jenny leaned forwards and bent down a little to kiss Jeff again. &quot;Thank you so much, Jeff! I love this! Now I can be taller whenever I want to! Oh, umm... can we also still continue from where we left off?&quot; She asked with horny anticipation. Jeff smiled and pushed away from the desk and tapped his lap. <br />
<br />
At his offer, Jenny lifted her right leg over her head and slid onto Jeff&#39;s standing errection before setting it back down and sliding into the chair with him. She sank down with her legs spread out over the top and outer sides of his thighs as the bulge in her abdomen became a bit more apparent. The lower she sank, the better she felt and the bigger the cock bulge she developed. <br />
<br />
Jeff set his hands on her naked ass and Jenny began moving herself up and down by bending her knees. Fucking Jeff&#39;s huge cock felt amazing. And even with her small frame, she somehow still had enough space inside her pussy to pack in his massive cock all the way down to its base. She continued to bounce herself up and down for a few minutes, absolutely loving every second of it. She was so happy that Jeff had given her permission to do this. <br />
<br />
 Not long after Jenny had gotten into a good rhythm, did Jeff cum inside her without even so much as a warning. She tightly wrapped her arms around her belly bulge in the hopes of keeping as much of it inside of her as she could as Jeff continued to geyser out glob after glob of his thick, steamy cum. Jenny could feel it&#39;s warmth inside of her and how it was almost like glue. Hardly any of it being allowed to drip out of her pussy, even when Jeff eventually pulled out of her, most of his cum stayed inside her and congealed into a warm, gooey mass.<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked and told her that he got a prompt about her wanting to him to safely cum directly inside her without her becoming pregnant and without him or her needing to use contraceptives. He had liked her thinking, and ended up turning his cum into a much thicker substance that would congeal into a mass when inside a warm and moist environment, instead of fertilizing an egg immediatly. This mass would be able to remain inside her for at least a week before it would begin to break down and risk impregnation her. Of course, he also made it so that she could always pull it out of her at any time, or thay he could even add more to it if she desired, and refresh the &quot;breakdown timer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jenny was more than happy to keep her prize which was still radiating heat inside of her for the time being and just snuggled up against Jeff. &quot;So, what will you do to me next?&quot; She softly whispered with a lewd look on her face.</p>
