<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the house, Dona and Tray continued to watch TV, doing nothing else.  With no knowledge of sex in their minds, they are nothing but kids and best friends.  Tray took a peak at Dona and felt good to take care of a little girl like her.  She is always bubbly and full of excitement that sometimes she like to have fun all day and not worry about life outside the house.  He then look back at the Television set and kept on watching cartoons he had never seen before, but liking every minute of it.  Meanwhile, Dona looks at her best friend and felt very protective with him.  Indeed Tray is a little older then her, five years older to be exact, but he always acts like a big brother.  And being the only child in the family, its tough to look up at someone who is older then you.  But when Tray comes and visit, she always felt comfortable with him and anyone else.  Smiling at her friend, she looks back at the cartoon show and nestled close to Tray as she could.  But as they were watching T.V., they regressed once more, approaching their childhood years.<br />
<br />
The two were now down to four years, making Dona five while Tray is ten.  Their heights plummeted downward leaving Dona about three feet as Tray was close to four feet.  Their arms and legs accompany the shrinkage as their feet could barely touch the floor.  At the same time, their bodies change to match their ages.<br />
<br />
Without any adult feature left on her body, Dona remained the same as always.  But that doesn’t mean she would regress past her life.  She continued to gain more weight by the second, which leaves her from being a thin preteen to a fat child.  Her facial features remained the same, but her cheeks continued to get puffy and her nose was getting smaller, almost button like.  Her eyes were getting bigger and had a shiny sheen into it, making them look more innocent then ever.  In her mouth, all of her remaining teeth withered and fall out, vanishing just like the other, while more teeth came in.  It was apparent that Dona now had rows of perfectly healthy baby teeth.  Her hair grew a little longer and then started to rearrange itself, forming two pigtails at the topsides of her head.<br />
<br />
Her clothes then join the ride of her regression.  Her pink shirt and beige shorts merge together and made one color and many designs.  This made them into a pink sundress that goes down to her knees with a logo of Barbie on the front and flower designs on the edge of her skirt.  Her panties change and became more childlike with a face of Barbie on the front.  Her socks disappear completely and her sneakers opened up and change into different brands.  The laces disappear and the rest of the sneakers became one part at the front.  It change color to pink as the soles became softer and was now a white color.  As of right now, her sneakers were turned into child sandals.<br />
<br />
Tray was having similar changes as Dona.  As he passed puberty, everything that made him a man had vanished completely.  Gone were his muscles and physique, gone was his body and pubic hair, gone was his handsome and rugged looks, and gone was his manhood and sexuality.  Now he was just a skinny kid with zero adultness in himself.  His face was pretty childish as well, with a round face, a small nose, and no facial hair.  In his mouth, three of his teeth in the back, including his canines fell and evaporated away, leaving the baby teeth to grow right back in.  His hair grew a little bit and gotten a little messy then before.  His clothes remained the same, but got smaller to fit his new frame.<br />
<br />
Their minds were still intact, but all the knowledge they had from before was washed away in a sea of memories.  Dona just entered grade school while Tray was beginning Junior High.  As they were watching Cartoon Network, Dona was getting a whole lot more impatient then ever.  So she put her hands in back of her head and said in a child like voice, “This show it booooring!”  Tray looked at his friend and said in a kid voice, “Why is this show boring?  This is a pretty cool show, though I never seen it before.”  And that is true.  Normally, Tray always watches not only Power Rangers, but also X-Men, VR Troopers, and Spider Man.  But for some reason, he doesn’t see any show he remembers.  Instead, he’s watching shows he never heard of or seen before.  Dona was getting a whole lot aggravated and said to him, “I don’t care.  I don’t want to see this show.  I want to see something else, NOW!!!”  Immediately, Tray picked up the remote and started to change the channel.  “All right, all right, you win.  Geese, don’t get all worked up for nothing.” he said, frantically changing the channels.  He changed from one station to another until he stopped at PBS where they were showing a Sesame Street Marathon.  “Wait, stop there.” Dona said with a smile on her face, “I love this show.”  Tray looked at the show where Big Bird was singing and sighed to himself.  “Great…” he said to himself, “Sesame Street…  Can’t believe you still watch that stupid show.”<br />
<br />
Outside the house, Wendy and Bobby looked on and were amazed that the two have become real life kids.  It was like watching a time-lapse video in reverse and couldn’t stop watching it.  “Gee, they are getting cuter and cuter by the minute.” Wendy said, feeling quite happy to see the former couple regressing before her eyes.  “I think I should adopt them when this is all over.”  Bobby on the other hand had a wicked smile on his face and knew that this was just the beginning.  He said, “You think they are cute now, wait until the next change.”</p>
