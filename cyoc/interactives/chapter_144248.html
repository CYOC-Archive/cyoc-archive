<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike got up from his bed quite a few minutes before Kyle. Mike looked over to see Kyle sleeping peacefully in his bed and for some reason, Mike had an urge to wake him. Mike did leave him since it was pretty early in the morning and Kyle would hate to be up now.<br />
<br />
Mike got changed into some normal clothes. He got changed into some shorts and a grey vest and took a mental note on the amount of body hair he seemed to have, thinking he&#39;d need to shave later.<br />
<br />
Mike decided to head out to the Cafeteria, hoping some food maybe there at this time in the morning. He was walking across the academy, taking in the morning breeze and he quickly got to the Cafeteria, not noticing subtle attempts to walk only on all fours.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, as he got to the Cafeteria, a surprising amount of Group Alpha was already there. Mike saw Janet sitting on the table having some beef stew and walked over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Janet, up early too?&quot; Mike was curious as to why she was up early and eating the same beef stew as last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, for some reason I just had to get up around this time. It&#39;s like a biological clock or something yet I&#39;ve never gotten up this early before.&quot; Janet responded to Mike&#39;s question<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true. Normally I&#39;m not up this early. I&#39;m normally in bed for another 3 hours.&quot; Mike looked at the clock that read 5:30 am &quot;Hey, so why are you eating the same beef stew we had last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what Group Alpha gets. It still tastes weird like yesterday but I&#39;ve learnt to deal with the tastes.&quot; Janet grumbled as she ate the stew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ain&#39;t that something. What do group Beta get? Do they get the same they had?&quot; Mike looked over trying to see what they have<br />
<br />
&quot;They apparently have some really fancy food they won&#39;t disclose to us &#39;Alphas&#39;.&quot; Janet takes up a passive aggressive tone<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that could be done as discrimination. Did you talk to someone about it.&quot; Mike felt a little sorry for Janet <br />
<br />
&quot;I did... and they said it&#39;s normal for Group Alpha to get that here. DO THEY NOT CARE FOR HUMAN WELLBEING!?!?&quot; Janet was seething with rage at this point so Mike left to go and get the stew Group Alpha got. <br />
<br />
Mike walked back and saw some odd behaviour in some of the other people. They weren&#39;t eating with cutlery, they put there faces into the bowels and ate the stew like &#39;dogs&#39;. While Mike somewhat wanted to, he still had dignity that wouldn&#39;t allow him to eat like that.<br />
<br />
Mike sat down and asked the somewhat still angry Janet &quot;Hey Janet, do you know why some people are eating like dogs? I&#39;m just seeing some odd behaviour with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently to be closer to dogs, you have to act like a dog. Or that&#39;s at least what the instructors say.&quot; Janet grunted, still red from anger.<br />
<br />
Janet and Mike continued to talk to each other. They talked much more openly then before and mentioned how they had loved ones back at home. Mike talked about his Fiance Rachel and Janet talked about Max, her husband. <br />
<br />
2 hours before Group Beta arrived, the instructors asked for Group Alpha to come with them. Apparently all of Group Alpha had arrived early so the instructors thought it was fitting to start Alpha&#39;s sessions early.<br />
<br />
Today, group Alpha was going to go through some mental training in the dog play area. Mike and Janet were thinking this may be related to how some other members of Group Alpha were acting in the Cafeteria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello all of Group Alpha.&quot; The instructor spoke with a megaphone. &quot;Currently you guys aren&#39;t ready to be around dogs yet so this session should help you to be around them.&quot; <br />
<br />
The instructors then went off and got a somewhat large tv for the 20-30 people in Group Alpha. They then played a somewhat hypnotic video which Janet and Mike watched.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be around dogs? Then why not act like a dog. Dogs love to walk on all fours so why not try it yourself?&quot; When the video said this, everyone in Group Alpha got on their hands and knees, including Janet and Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dogs don&#39;t know how to use cutlery to eat, so you shouldn&#39;t know either.&quot; Mike and Janet then forgot how to eat using knives and forks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dogs love to play, so go off and play too.&quot; Everyone in Group Alpha then ran around on all fours, playing with the dog toys scattered around the play room.<br />
<br />
At one point Mike crawled over to Janet who was playing with some rope. &quot;Janet, wanna play.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Janet barked in a reply<br />
<br />
Janet and Mike then began to play fight with the rope. They tugged at it as hard as they could and were acting almost like playful puppies.<br />
<br />
Eventually, it was lunch time for them and Group Alpha tried to leave before an instructor called out &quot;Before you go, we need to place something around your neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the instructor said this, dog trainers started walking around a placing what were collars on people. Mike had a blue, leather collar with Janet getting a similar one but pink.<br />
<br />
As soon as the collars were placed onto everyone, the doors were open and a stampede of people from Group Alpha ran/crawled to the Cafeteria. The members of the stampede also didn&#39;t care about opening doors and just ran through the dog flaps to &#39;get more in line with acting like a dog&#39;.<br />
<br />
Group Beta was already in the Cafeteria during this time so when Group Alpha was running there, they could hear them from outside. Charlotte and Kyle turned to the door and saw the massive wave of people from Group Alpha on all fours with Mike and Janet somewhere in the middle of it.<br />
<br />
Group Alpha each ran to ripen seats with Mike and Janet heading to their roommates &quot;Hey Charlotte and Kyle.&quot; Mike said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis, me and Mike are here.&quot; Janet chirped<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, me and Kyle can see that. I assume you did some mental training and that&#39;s why your all on hands and knees.&quot; Charlotte questioned as she looked at her sister<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. We also got these collars for some reason.&quot; Janet and Mike pointed to their separate collars around their necks<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, I like the style.&quot; Kyle praised, giving and nice feeling to Janet and Mike &quot;Me and Charlotte also got your food so just jump on the seats to have it.&quot; Kyle pointed to the bowls of beef stew on the table <br />
<br />
Seeing this, Mike and Janet jumped up onto the seats where they sat this morning. They immediately chowed down on the stew, not caring that they weren&#39;t using cutlery since &#39;dogs don&#39;t know how to use cutlery&#39;. They also ate super fast since it seemed even more tastier then earlier today.<br />
<br />
As meals were finished, the four like usual talked in a group. They spoke about their last sessions and how Group Alpha got to play in the playroom. Group Beta just had to practise chasing dogs if they ever got loose by doing a fitness test.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALL GROUPS SHOULD HEAD TO THE MAIN FIELD. REPEATING, ALL GROUPS SHOULD HEAD TO THE MAIN FIELD.&quot; And announcement was broadcasted in the Cafeteria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems were going to be in the same session for the rest of the day guys.&quot; Kyle called out<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems so, I wonder why they are going to have us in the same session next.&quot; Charlotte wondered<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be fun.&quot; Janet said with Mike nodding along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s not waste time and let&#39;s go.&quot; Kyle announced as they all headed off to the field.<br />
<br />
At the field, their was a bunch of equipment for something like a dog show with people standing around it. In front of the equipment was the instructor for Group Beta with a megaphone.<br />
<br />
The instructor got his megaphone and instructed the groups &quot;As you are aware, Group Alpha and Group Beta will be working together for this afternoon session. First things first, everyone in Group Beta, please take a leash from the box that matches the colour of the collar your roommate is wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte and Kyle went over and each graves a leash. Kyle obviously got blue while Charlotte got pink, what her sister Janet was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you&#39;ve done that, attach the leash to your do- roommate. Attach it to your roommate.&quot; The instructor quickly corrected himself as the people followed his instructions<br />
<br />
For many of the members of Group Beta, it took a while for the leash to attach. While this may be quite humiliating for Mike and Janet, they seemed pretty happy to be treated like this as it&#39;s like being a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder why they are making us do this to all of you in Group Alpha.&quot; Kyle thought as he looked at Mike<br />
<br />
Mike was just looking up at Kyle confused as he seemed to be looking at him oddly. Must be something Betas have that makes them look at Alphas weirdly.<br />
<br />
Once it was all done, the instructor talked about what this session was for &quot;This session is to help both groups with their objectives. Group Beta is going to try to be brilliant dog trainers while Group Alpha is trying to get closer to dogs. What this session involves is similar to a dog show as together you and your roommate must help each other to clear the course. Everyone will take turns to clear this and I hope for the best to all.&quot; The instructor then left the stage.<br />
<br />
For the next few hours, every pair attempted to clear the course. Group Beta had to use the leash to guide Group Alpha successfully across it which took several attempts until Mike, Janet and everyone else mastered the course.<br />
<br />
By the time everyone cleared the course, it was time for dinner for everyone. Group Alpha tried to scurry of to the Cafeteria but since they had the leashes still on, they couldn&#39;t. Apparently the leashes were a mandatory part of the uniform when going outside now so Charlotte and Kyle had to walk Mike and Janet to the Cafeteria.<br />
<br />
On arrival to the Cafeteria, people saw, on the floor, there were bowels of beef stew with people&#39;s names from Group Alpha on them, placed next to different tables with plates of Chicken salad on the tables. By one table, there was a blue bowel with &#39;Mike&#39; on it and a pink bowel with &#39;Janet&#39; on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems they really want to get you to act like dogs that they are making you eat from a bowel on the floor.&quot; Kyle asked to Mike, who was too busy fixated on food.<br />
<br />
Kyle sat next to Charlotte on the table while Mike and Janet ate from the floor from the respective bowels. Kyle and Charlotte were having a nice, and subtly romantic, conversation while they watched their roommates enjoy the kibble off the floor.<br />
<br />
This lasted for an hour or 2 until the scheduled night time hours when people had to return to their rooms. Kyle guided Mike on his leash and took it off when they got inside the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have a nice day today Mike.&quot; Kyle asked as he stroke the top of Mike&#39;s head, feeling some small and odd bumps.<br />
<br />
Mike nodded as he savoured the stroking that he was receiving from Kyle. Eventually Kyle got changed and had a shower with Mike waiting out side.<br />
<br />
Mike did try to change while waiting for Kyle but he was having difficulty taking his clothes off so he was going to ask Kyle to help him. Kyle eventually got out the shower and Mike looked up and asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clothes, help.&quot; Mike barked as Kyle looked at him<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need me to take your clothes off Mike?&quot; Kyle asked with Mike nodding &quot;Oh you poor boy, I&#39;ll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle then stripped Mike completely down until Mike was naked, his member and was exposed to the world. Mike looked down, relieved to be out of his clothes as he also noted the considerable amount of body hair he had.<br />
<br />
Almost all of Mike&#39;s chest had thick brown hair like the one he had on his head hich was quire thick and long. His pubic hair created a large bush that could cover his penis if you looked at it from a certain angle. His back also had some thick hairs but not as much as his chest and mostly was centred around his tail bone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be so much better to sleep in as I bet with all that hair, you be boiling in clothes.&quot; Kyle looked at Mike and then placed him onto his separate bed, taking note how much lighter Mike was now.<br />
<br />
Mike felt his bed and curled up into a ball on top of it. He looked like a sleeping dog with what he was doing when Kyle looked over at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, Mike. Goodnight.&quot; Kyle then dozed of into his own sleep</p>
