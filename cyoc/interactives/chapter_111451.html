<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So far Brian’s evening at the Elder Council was going okay. Assisting the kitchen staff in preparing meals for the prisoners; he caught the eye of this attractive looking female were-beaver. Not knowing that such weres existed or even lived in Moon Lake; Brian was about to approach her as she was washing dishes, when Steve his supervisor approached.<br />
“Come Brian,” Steve speaking; “it’s time to serve the prisoners there evening meals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Following the were-horse as Brian pushes the trolley containing twenty six meal trays. The smells emanating from the trays made him hungry. Brian like the smell of the meatloaf that was prepared; despite the sandwich he had earlier, the food the prisoners were being served was topnotch and was making him think about having a second sandwich before leaving.<br />
“Don’t worry,” Steve hearing Brian’s stomach churning; “we’ll have a quick break with time to have a bite to eat.”<br />
“Leftover meatloaf,” Brain licking his lips.<br />
“Better,” Steve smiling; “There is some leftover beef pot roast from Franklin catering. They have a standing contract to setup and serve a buffet table on the common area whenever council is in session.”<br />
“I don’t know,” Brain looking at the food trays; “the meatloaf here smells real good.”<br />
“More pot roast for me then,” Steve chuckling.<br />
<br />
Using his key card; Brian heads into the holding cells which other staff members have nicknamed ‘the dungeon’. While the lower levels were dry and comfortable; Brian could feel a sense of unease as he is immediately blasted with the scent of over two dozen werewolves. Being a were-otter and feeling quite apprehensive in entering a corridor with many hungry predators held behind steel bar doors. Steve placed a hoof like paw in Brian’s shoulders; letting him know that there is nothing to worry about. Settling his nerves Brian walks down the corridor stopping in between the cell doors to hand the food trays through the slots. Despite his apprehension; Brian found most of the werewolves sullen as they meekly accept their meals. A few were even polite and courteous as Brian handed them their dinners; thanking the were-otter in the process.<br />
<br />
It was getting to the final cell that made Brain pause; recognizing the scent of the occupant and seeing Julie squatting as she was using the toilet in her cell to relieve herself. Julie noticing Brian just as she finishes wiping her nethers and flushing the toilet she stands and stares not bothering to pull her pants back up; not even bothering to hide her genitals and pubic bush.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; asked Julie, snarling the question as she spotted Brain standing on the other side of her cell.<br />
&quot;Some of us have to work,&quot; replied Brian Walker, as he held back sliding her food tray through the slot in the cell bars; &quot;not all of us were lucky enough to be born with a silver spoon in our mouths. You were just dumb enough to throw it away afterwards.”<br />
“Dumb,” Julie looking incredulous; “your calling me dumb?”<br />
“Has it not sunk into you yet,” Brain raising his voice; “that you have no one to blame for your predicament but yourself. Where are your mom and dad? Have they even bothered to visit you? Try to comfort you? Say it will be alright? Do you even expect them to show up?”<br />
“Brian,” Steve interrupting.<br />
“I’m not done,” Brian cutting the were-horse off; “Julie ever since we met, you have scheme and manipulated your way to the beds of many weres eager to plant their seed in you. Mine included!” <br />
“You want to go another round;” Julie spreading her legs as she sat on her bed; “your well hung pony can even join us.”<br />
“I wouldn’t stick my prick in you,” Brian snarls; “not even if you paid me.”<br />
“I’m married,” Steve snorting; “and we are done here Brian.”<br />
“So is Julie,” Brian finally pushing her food tray through the slot; causing it to fall and spill its contents onto the floor; “see you in a hundred and fifty years harlot, I and everyone in school will not be missing you,” Brain sneering; “have a merry Christmas.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Taking his break in the common room; Brian Walker was munching on some of the leftover Meatloaf while Steve was digging into the beef pot roast he managed to secure. Brian who saw the were-beaver again, but this time, her noticing him and winking as she entered the female washroom with a cleaning cart; Steve couldn’t help but notice the sudden infatuation.<br />
“Looks like you caught the eye of Patricia,” Steve commenting.<br />
“I think it’s more than just an eye,” Brian answering; “she is one beaver I would definitely like to dam up with my spunk.”<br />
“Not here in the council building,” Steve answers sternly; “besides, Patricia only just started a few days ago. Like you she is still in training.”<br />
Brian stares at the female washroom as the were-beaver he noticed earlier leaves. Both staring at each other; the Were-beaver smiles slyly as she heads to the back corridor with her cleaning cart. Brian feeling flushed as he watches the girl raise her flat tail; letting him get a good look at her plump round ass as she disappears behind the door.<br />
“Come on lover boy,” Steve helping Brian up; “break time is over and the second floor security card readers are down again. I’ll show you to the computer to see if you can figure out why they keep crapping out all the time.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Back in the dungeon, Julie was staring at the spilled food from the tray Brian shoved through the cell door. Ignored during breakfast and not having anything but a sandwich while in the council chambers because she wouldn’t keep her mouth shut. Not having anything to eat since then; Julie breaks down; crying as she is forced to eat what she could off the cold floor. Feeling humiliated she stares at the plastic knife; wishing it was a real one so she could try and kill herself.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
As Betty Van Rosenberg a black-furred were-cat, re-enters the common area; she nearly has a heart attack as she sees the young were-otter Brian Walker that rocked her world Thursday of last week. Quickly turning around so the kid does not see and recognize her; Betty slams right into a were-beaver.<br />
“Sorry about that,” Betty helping the female were up; “I saw someone I recognized and didn’t want them to know I was here.”<br />
“Old flame,” the were-beaver asking.<br />
“Something like that,” Betty turning to see Brian being escorted by a large were-horse to a custodial staff only door; “but he was great in the sack.”<br />
“Most were-horses are,” the were-beaver answers; “never had the pleasure though.”<br />
“Me neither,” Betty answering; “but I was referring to the were-otter.”<br />
“You know him,” the were-beaver looking shocked.<br />
“Oh,” Betty smiling; “you have the hots for Brian.”<br />
“So that’s his name,” The were-beaver looking longingly at the door the were-otter went through; “how do you know him?”<br />
“Through a mutual friend,” Betty answering; her heart heavy thinking of Alyssa Cooper; “she is gone now, and the age difference between me and Brian, it could never work. He is fourteen,” Betty sighing; “and I live in Seattle. While the laws in Moon lake do allow sex with a minor, provided they are a were and willing-”<br />
“Doesn’t apply to me,” the were-beaver grinning; “I’m sixteen and will be attending Moon Lake high after winter break. My family just moved here from Canada.”<br />
“Tell you what,” Betty smiling; “I’ll give you Brian’s phone number. It’ll drive him crazy to see you texting photos of that sexy looking tail of yours to him.” Betty grabbing the lithe were-beaver’s phone and plugging in Brian’s phone number in it and handing it back to her; the were-beaver smiles as she starts texting the otter despite the fact she is still on the job. Betty smiling as she walks away; having the good sense to give the girl Brian’s old number, the one he said was hot after his mother and the sheriff found out about the Gigolo gig.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Brian was looking at the security program for the card reader. Staring at the source code and not finding anything wrong; Brian wonders if the issue Steve told him about could either be a firmware issue or perhaps electrical. Neither his area of expertise. Having to reboot to system just to get it up and running again at least temporary; Brian knows this will be a recurring issue unless the root cause is soon addressed. Getting up his phone vibrates; thinking it’s his mother Emily wanting to see how his first day is progressing, he is shocked to see a text displaying a beaver tail photo with the message ‘Your cute. like what you see?’<br />
<br />
Brian can feel a stirring in his loins as his member starts to slowly rise from his sheathe. About to send another text, when another comes in<br />
‘Meet me at the lake tomorrow. I hear you are a hot stud that can make a girl feel full and complete. Around eight in the morning.’<br />
Brian moaning as he his member is standing at full mast demanding attention; Brian grins as he takes a selfie of his were-otter package. Adding a message ‘and I hope you like what you see, Patricia.’<br />
Brian hitting send as he puts his phone away and on silent so as not to be disturbed by more interruption; albeit pleasant and kinky. He leaves the server room to find Steve and report what he found out regarding the security card system on the second floor.</p>
