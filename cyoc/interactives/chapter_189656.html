<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rod busied himself with some of the work that he&#39;d had to do while adapting to both his new form and new abilities. He liked the White Rhinoceros&#39; size and strength, and since the conversion didn&#39;t hamper his eyesight in the way the mundane animal did, he took it as a vast improvement, and he considered his conversion over Horizon&#39;s promotion for &quot;Pride Month&quot; to be one of the best decisions he&#39;d ever made. It was something that let him make up for what he&#39;d never been able to do in his Human life. For he&#39;d grown up in world where homosexuality was viewed as sinful and to a family that only understood what the church and conservatives told them. Thus, Rod knew that when he found out that he was gay... he&#39;d have to hide it, at least to avoid arguments at home and losing work opportunities.<br />
<br />
But this often left him without any real romantic attention. He&#39;d managed a date here or there, but it was often limited to going to a sports bar to pretend that they were more there to see the game and &quot;not get nagged&quot; while watching the game, and it never got any farther than that. Often because as time went on... he&#39;d also found himself having to look after his parents over the years, who wouldn&#39;t go into a nursing home remained as they were when he was young, and that put a lot of pressure on him, just as it did when he was young. When his parents died of old age and Rod and the world was at least starting to accept homosexual couple&#39;s going out, he&#39;d become old enough that a lot of it wasn&#39;t really worth it any more. No one was going to waste time with a aging gay bank teller when they had their futures ahead of them... and those friends that might have been partners, &quot;moved on&quot; when he could never challenge his parents.<br />
<br />
At first he was turned off by Animalia, largely because of how the previous administration suggested it would be a &quot;cure&quot; for homosexuality. He may not have been brave enough to come out, but neither was he going to just conform to be what the sorts of people that he&#39;d always feared wanted. However, there was some actual curiosity about Animalia that was there and while the news tended to be all over the place, and a lot of Animalia Ambassadoria struck him as unprofessional not exactly helpful, because of how much they relied on gags, jokes, and making fun of stupid people, but that curiosity was there. It did eventually get him in contact, via email, with figures from Horizon and representatives from Animalia that were more in line with who he&#39;d been. The result was that he learned that while conversion did tend to make homosexual Humans into bisexual Animalians, those that were in same sex partnerships didn&#39;t necessarily leave those partnerships. That was finally what got him the idea to move in and take the plunge, and the discount for Pride Month made it even better... and thinking back on it made Rod smile...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Rod moved slowly as he looked down the halls of Horizon as he followed Judy from the waiting room. There were a few other people that had been there as part of the Pride Month package, and to a degree, Rod felt relieved that he wasn&#39;t the only one there that had had issues with either restrictive parents or being afraid to come out of the closet. Though, he also felt a bit saddened by the fact that they also weren&#39;t going with the White Rhinoceros as their Animalian of choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve all been very kind,&quot; Rod said after a moment, his voice sound a bit nervous as he followed Judy as the Rabbit Animalian opened the door to one of the conversion rooms while holding the plastic box that held the likely ready doses for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;and besides... being kind is better than being cruel, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
They then reached the door to one of the conversion rooms and Judy opened and allowed Rod to enter. He did so and looked over to the bed that was the only piece of furniture in the room, which Rod guessed as for romantic couples that converted together or wanted one of Horizon&#39;s Animalian staff members to do the conversion for those a bit nervous around needles. He slowly moved to sit on the bed and then nervously looked over to Judy, who was opening the plastic where his doses were contained. He was a bit nervous as he was male and Judy was obviously female.<br />
<br />
&quot;How... how long does it take for the conversion to start?&quot; Rod asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t instantaneous... but it is pretty quick,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;and since the White Rhino is a LARGE animal... you probably will outgrow your clothes. Though if you&#39;re nervous, I won&#39;t be staying inside the room as you change, so you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod nodded and managed to kick off his shoes with his feet while then lifting up his left sleeve with his right arm. He had no reason to think Judy would try anything, but for the moment he wanted to keep some things private. Judy nodded and readied his shoulder with an alcohol swab and then gave him the provided the injections needed for Rod&#39;s double dosing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; Judy said as she delivered the first injection and then delivered the second. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before she then left and even before the door shut, Rod felt a bit warm. Though as the door did shut, Rod was quick to begin stripping off his clothing. He knew he&#39;d need new clothes as an Animalian, but he didn&#39;t want to destroy the ones he was wearing and figured he could either donate them to charity or sell them to a pawn shop or something that would also sell some clothes. As he undressed though, he found that his skin was already turning from pink to a light grayish color, largely fitting within the color range of the White Rhinoceros. When he got down to his socks, he found that while his feet lengthened a bit, he also that his feet were changing a bit to only have three toes, and that two toes merged together to become one bigger one, as did the next two toes. His big toe then simply swelled larger with his enlarging feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Rob thought as he leaned back to raise one foot up, with it now tipped by a heavy and rounded hoof-like nail. To some extent this was no surprise. Rhinoceros were odd toed ungulates, and many Animalians that had become Ungulate mammals, be they odd or even toed, had their feet largely match the mundane animal&#39;s foot structure while their hands remained unchanged. The only changes to his hands was that they swelled larger with both stronger bones and more muscle around them.<br />
<br />
In fact the biggest thing so far, even as Rob felt the cartilage in his ear stretch until they came to a point and moved to the top and back of his head, was actually in the growth in his muscle mass. He&#39;d normally been relatively modest in terms of his build, but as his skin tightened and his youth restored itself, his muscles began to enlarge. Every group seemed to get bigger and throbbed as they enlarged, though the throbbing pulses in his muscles actually wasn&#39;t painful. In some ways, it actually felt quite good as his penis not only enlarged but rapidly became erect and enlarged with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Rob said slowly as he looked down to his rising and growing erection. One hand brushed it and it sent shivers of pleasure down it and soon flooded his brain with a lot of pleasurable feelings. Unable to hold himself back Rob brought his hand up to that erection and soon gripped it, and it wasn&#39;t long before it slid up and down on that shaft and raising more feelings of pleasure, making him moan as he continued to change. &quot;Ohhhh... yyeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss...&quot;<br />
<br />
As this happened, his face began to push forward while his upper lip broadened into the wide flat front that the White Rhino had that differentiated it from the Black Rhino. It wasn&#39;t long after that two horns began to grow up from the top of his growing muzzle and it left Rod giving out an even deeper moan as they grew in size while stroking his penis. He mentally recognized his strength and power and with that came confidence, and as his tail started to grow out behind him there came the certainty that he wouldn&#39;t repeat the mistakes he&#39;d made in the past. He&#39;d be open and strong and wouldn&#39;t back down from what he thought or wanted... and shortly after he came shooting loads of semen across the room.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course getting checked by the female put a bit of a damper on that,&quot; Rod thought to himself, remembering his run in with Elly Nozdrin.<br />
<br />
Pumped up on the power from his transformation and the confidence that came with it, he went looking for a challenge, but most of the Rhino Guard members were working and had no time for him. He also got the warning that if he tried anything with them he&#39;d end up in the jail until he cooled off. From there he ended up finding Elly running laps around what had been the football field for the Lyre High School Football field. It was one of the things that ultimately benefitted from the merger between WSA and the Lyre School District. While Animalia really couldn&#39;t compete in most of the sports leagues until there were enough Animalians that every town&#39;s team wouldn&#39;t be at a massive disadvantage trying to counter an Animalians&#39; greater size and strength, it did offer areas for outdoor training that Elly had taken advantage of.<br />
<br />
Though, looking for a challenge, Rod wasn&#39;t in much mood to back down when learning that Elly was of Russian heritage and then put his foot in his mouth over her allegiances. After all the Russian government had become antagonistic toward the west under its present government and had been removing democratic barriers to leave their &quot;leader&quot; in power, regardless of support. It had openly courted the previous American administration which Rod was fairly sure had been at best an unknowing puppet of the Russians, and now that the American government had changed was returning to the points of opposition that they&#39;d had before and his confrontation left him open to Elly charging him. The blow wasn&#39;t all that painful in that he couldn&#39;t recover from it, but while male Rhinos were bigger than females, that didn&#39;t mean that females weren&#39;t something easily trifled with. <br />
<br />
It was really his pride that was hurt the worst by it, though he ultimately had to admit that it was also enough to get him to think more clearly. Though for the rest of the summer it also left him with troubling worries that he&#39;d lose who&#39;d been before hand, particularly in noticing her wide well muscled hips and the two large breasts that hung firmly from her chest. It then didn&#39;t help that all the other male Rhinoceros Animalians were straight. It was something that left him feeling sexually frustrated at times...<br />
<br />
&quot;But she hasn&#39;t forced herself on me,&quot; Rod thought to himself, &quot;so there&#39;s that. If she did... THEN there&#39;d be trouble.&quot;</p>
