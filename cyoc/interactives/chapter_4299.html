<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck Robertson had been an insurance inspector for twenty plus years. His daily travels went far and wide as he checked the customer's place of business for possible claims. Chuck never married and as far as he was concerned never wanted either wife or family.<br />
<br />
The truest of loner's Chuck did his work, drove home plopped in front of the TV and fell asleep in his easyboy chair. No hobbies, no outside interests, just sports and more sports was his only interest in life till!<br />
<br />
A Fall friday morning he was to go to the Double R-R Ranch to inspect for infractions in codes and possible claim situations. This was his only inspection for the day and he longed for an early quit today.<br />
<br />
Seventy eight miles North from town on U.S. 13 to the Cooper exit, then right for six miles to Old Pony Road. The final address as 91012 Old Pony Road. <br />
<br />
The drive took longer than expected and Chuck had a personal need to stop. A old time root beer stand took his attention and he pulled in for a sip and a drip. Once his order was taken by the waitress he asked for a restroom. The only offer was a outhouse a good hundred yards to the rear of the stand.<br />
<br />
A little self consious of others watching him wander to the small house in wide open view he tried to hold for his final stop. The cold root beer almost burst the dam holding his willpower. So Chuck made the long walk to the little red house.<br />
<br />
Lucky when he opened the door the other vehicle had left and he was the only customer. The quick walk produced a tree root and he stunbled to the ground. Moaning his scraped knee he noted the torn pantleg and muttered a few choice words. As he pushed off the ground  his hand came in contact with a shinny silver ring.<br />
<br />
The bobble was bright and seemed to fit his pinky finger. Nongender in size and shape it looked OK with his other jewelry. The ride on to the farm he kept looking at his find and wondered it's value.<br />
<br />
Double R-R Ranch was very nice and well kept. All the buildings were painted with good roofs. Chuck noted the fair sized herd of thiry ponies, a couple of draft horses, and a few cows and pigs for ultimate slaughter, no problems!<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin was the owner of the farm and watched Chuck like a hawk. It was when Chuck disappeared into the pony stable for an hour she had to check on his whereabouts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a problem here?&quot; she asked seeing Chuck standing in the open pasture doorway. <br />
<br />
&quot;No I was just thinking how peaceful the farm is and the view down the valley makes me think of a place to retire someday.&quot; said Chuck not breaking his view to answer.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin cleared her throat and walked toward the open barn door. A clap of her hands sent the pony herd into a wild run for the barn. The sight of a stampede running him down made Chuck climb some hay bales.<br />
<br />
A cloud of dust and the herd stopped around Mrs. Ranskin as if puppies coming in from play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, do they respect you!&quot; said Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;They know my voice and it reminds them of safety in the barn and food.&quot; said Mrs. Ranskin.<br />
<br />
Chuck watched as she cut up apples and fed the to the hungry ponies. A distant ring of the phone sent the lady running to the house. The ponies milled about the stranger as one became uneasy.<br />
<br />
A whinnie and the herd stopped their movements. The pony walked zigzag through the herd to stand near to Chuck. As Chuck petted the pony he became part of the scene as the dun colored stallion bounced astride a mare's back and began his techinque of making love.<br />
<br />
Chuck was stuck by the other ponies and could not make them move an inch. His own love life being dull had a strange and sudden interest in the stallion's poking at the mare's rump.<br />
<br />
Whether it was a friendly aid or just the fond hope to get it over and walk out of the corral Chuck reached over and guided the big cock into the proper spot. The touch brought a gaze down from the high mounted pony. A whinnie of thanks and he went to work on the mare as if it was his employment.<br />
<br />
Chuck watched in interest as he had never see a pony do it, let alone be this close.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin had not returned when the stallion dismounted and stood wagging his member still enjoying the delight. Chuck petted the strong neck and black mane. The air was filled with the scent of stallion and musky odors all around.<br />
<br />
Chuck looked down on the stallion much as the pony had viewed Chuck, when he said, &quot; Damn how my life is lonely, I wish I was like you, free and enjoying you God given abilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
All went black till the sound of the frantic lady trying to revive the man laying face down in the corral.<br />
<br />
Chuck heard himself moaning but didn't know why the sound seemed to come from several feet away. The sound of the Firetruck and rescue crew made Chuck turn around and not try to listen.<br />
<br />
The ponies were shewed back for the men to work on Chuck. Coughing and maoning Chuck sat up looking very dazed. Mrs. Ranskin spoke to him but only rambling sounds came from the mouth. Chuck looked on and wondered why he didn't speak. As his body was loaded on the stretcher he heard the Rescue man suggest Chuck had a stroke and was nolonger able to communicate.<br />
<br />
The crew left and Chuck watched till he thought of himself still looking out the barn door at his vehicle and body taken away. Turning round he looked about and found he'd exchanged bodies' with the dun colored stallion.</p>
