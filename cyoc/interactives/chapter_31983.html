<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Whao. Did you see Sam go?&quot; Jacqueline declared looking down at the first semi-final.<br />
<br />
&quot;No but I saw that smaller guy go down.&quot; Replied Keith, &quot;Weird, I was told to always bet on <br />
the little guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacqueline shook her head, &quot;That's never -underestimate- the little guy, and Sam is the <br />
little guy down there. It's safe to assume that he's the only former female in that group of <br />
bucks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or any -other- former females in that group have totally changed colors and gone over to <br />
the other side.&quot; Keith suggested, having done so himself, he didn't think it impossible for <br />
others to have.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say that's a scary thought from how those bucks in general act, but I'd be guilty of <br />
hypocrisy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that shorter guy seems to have changed attitude fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That all have. In case you were too busy watching the fights to notice. This isn't just good <br />
sportsmanship, this is a complete revision to their pecking order!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the bucks are acting like-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bucks. It's a little, creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More creepy than you and me going around on all fours opening up the wind pipes of <br />
random non-sentient animals?&quot; Keith pointed out leaning back.<br />
<br />
 Jacqueline thought about it for a minute, &quot;Granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith meanwhile felt his adrenaline building up again, the next fight. Though he really <br />
didn't want to be that young guy right now. Panthers were predators and deer were prey, <br />
but Keith -still- would prefer to steer clear of that eight pointed scarred buck.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting.&quot; Su Yin said vaguely getting the other does' attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the park's geneticists were quite thorough in removing all heat cycles, and any <br />
pheromones that would effect our libido or dull our reason. It appears that at least some <br />
sociological instincts were either looked over or intentionally left intact. The fact Leticia <br />
would gain a unconditional desire for a partner while watching the bucks establish their <br />
pecking order is direct proof of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or she just wants some.&quot; Jenny giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny!&quot; Hannah reprimanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Said Leticia meanwhile was feeling uncomfortable being the topic of discussion. But as <br />
long as things didn't turn out any more intimate, she'd be okay. The reminder of the anti-<br />
pregnancy did sober her, but only a tiny bit. If the temporary female got pregnant on this <br />
vacation, her girlfriend in the outside world would -never- let her live it down, ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder,&quot; Thought Su Yin,  &quot;was it a miscalculation on the park's part, or was it <br />
intentional to see if we could still act civilized with such instincts subconsciously effecting <br />
our Super Egos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam's words came back to haunted Hannah again, 'We're all one big group of beta-<br />
testers.'<br />
<br />
'And you can help open the door for us Hannah--you can be the one.' As did Juanita's.<br />
<br />
And Hannah realized that it was indeed logical, that Juanita, and the people behind the <br />
scenes like her, wanting bodies they felt they had a justification for, would want to see <br />
many instincts they could have along for the ride, which were a PART of those desired <br />
bodies,  before rational thought got lost in the mix.<br />
<br />
Juanita seemed honest enough, but that didn't mean the human wasn't looking out for her <br />
own self interests.<br />
<br />
It took Hannah a few seconds to realize what she had just thought 'the human.'<br />
&quot;What's happening to us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's is a good question,&quot; Su Yin responded. Hannah hadn't realized she had spoken out <br />
loud. &quot;But I seriously doubt even the park's top brass know what the answer is.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Yahoo wee!&quot; Mike jumped up a bit and kicked his heels together. &quot;Did you see that? That <br />
was a fantastic move by that taller buck! He had the disadvantaged with the higher center <br />
of gravity and -still- pulled it off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine nodded, &quot;Yes, I suppose it was clever.&quot; She was doing her best to remind herself <br />
what she had loved about physical contact sports.<br />
<br />
Mike wasn't acting so hyperactive just because he found the event exciting, in fact, he was <br />
doing it BECAUSE he could. His deformities had never left him in much shape for sports, <br />
most equipment couldn't fit him, limiting sports to purely interactions with his family. Ever <br />
since coming here, he felt like he was living a dream, but after meeting Jasmine, he felt <br />
like he was actually ALIVE! His family had loved him and he had made it through life, but <br />
he felt like a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders!  &quot;Too bad my gang isn't <br />
here.&quot; He said, reminding the two fox ladies he was the leader of some of the park's foxes. <br />
&quot;They'd love this show! Too bad we showed up as late as we did. I could have gone back <br />
and gotten them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How, nice.&quot; Laurie consciously reminded herself that Mike's gang was not a -real- gang in <br />
the common sense of the word, it was a word used in this case just to make things sound <br />
more macho. Laurie almost asked why none of the does were participating, but them <br />
lacking antlers, she was pretty sure she could understand why. Thankfully the people who <br />
were into foxes had a much wider variety of people than the people who chose to became <br />
bucks, the foxes seemed to come from nearly all walks of life. Though there were a few <br />
former males who kept asking if there was a way to have their fur genetically altered to be <br />
blue. Regardless of gender, they were still video game fanboys at heart! (She had been <br />
given an in-depth explanation of the game Star Fox by one of her nephews before coming <br />
to the park.)<br />
<br />
Mike was VERY tempted to just whistle and hoped his group heard him, but he knew that it <br />
might distract the bucks, and second he had found that trying to whistle with a muzzle <br />
and all canines could result in some nasty tongue injuries.<br />
<br />
Laurie herself felt like she was shadowing over her daughter and daughter's boyfriend at <br />
their first football game. But her curiosity got the better of her, and she -still- wanted to <br />
make sure Mike and Jasmine didn't do anything stupid. True, she knew technically they <br />
were adults, but animal heat cycled removed or not, they were still a pair of hormone filled <br />
teenagers.<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
One of the news hounds, this one ironically a half-human lynx, had been given the task of <br />
sweeping the perimeter of the buck's tournament and getting reactions and different <br />
points of view from the various other watchers. Sadly, this also meant getting a point of <br />
view from Monty Mongoose and his motley crew.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you see honorary member of the news hound tribe.&quot; The lynx was silent but internally <br />
moaned. Only Monty's crew used the term 'tribe' and it was painful to everyone else's ears. <br />
&quot;This is the second stage of The Government's evil plan to turn us all into slaves and <br />
soldiers as our military loses too many troops in Iraq to oppress the people's will.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lynx just hoped to memorize the uper complex yet contrived conspiracy theory <br />
quickly and move onto the does, foxes, or the panthers that had also gathered for the <br />
tournament.<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Spike was large, and a series of eight pointed antlers to boot! Jeremy recognized this fact <br />
even before they faced each other. Spike was fast in spite of his size, and efficient.<br />
<br />
However, Jeremy didn't even quiver. After finally closing Lance's mouth, Jeremy had <br />
climbed his way through the ranks, and now just two more fights and he.... what? Proved <br />
he was the most worthy of beauty queen Hannah? That he was alpha buck or whatever you <br />
called it with deer? He knew that they had started this whole thing just to show off to <br />
beauty queen Hannah. But it honestly felt like to Jeremy that it had grown beyond that. <br />
True, there was a sense of dissatisfaction without the does watching, but the fact they had <br />
continued when they had left for some reason or another, and no one had suggested <br />
stopping the tournament, suggested there was more to this than just a typical frat macho <br />
contest. The way he look at Lance now, seeing a subordinate, and the way Lance acted <br />
towards him, seeing only a superior, while the same time their rational minds (it didn't feel <br />
right calling it the 'human' part of them) knew about their actual ranking in frat, was proof <br />
of that. <br />
<br />
Jeremy had always been considered the runt of the litter, someone for the senior members <br />
of the frat, in particular Lance, to torture. However, those attitudes were changing before <br />
his very eyes with each buck he brought down. He knew rational, logically, and very much <br />
inevitably, that once their mass vacation was over, and their ultimately returned to collage, <br />
Lance would make Jeremy's life Hell for this humiliation. But at this moment in time, <br />
Jeremy realized he just didn't care.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you enjoyed your time as a rising star.&quot; Said Spike too calmly. Pulling Jeremy out of <br />
his introspection. &quot;Because this is where you call in line with the rest. All the same, thank <br />
you for shutting up that blow hard Lance. Summit now, and you'll save yourself a lot of <br />
hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.&quot; Jeremy said on reaction alone. &quot;I never thought I'd get this far, I'm going to see <br />
how far I can get!&quot; <br />
<br />
Spike put one hooved foot in front of another and hunched over lowering himself, not <br />
trying to use his size to intimidate Jeremy like Jeremy thought Spike would. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that's the way you want it. Then let's begin.&quot; Spike lowered his head, as did Jeremy and <br />
they charged. <br />
<br />
The scarred rival was intense, as the younger buck felt himself being pushed back each <br />
time their antlers made contact, his heart pounded. His armored fingers and 'toes' left <br />
deep ruts in the dirt.  <br />
<br />
The younger buck realized the scarred rival's pattern was predictable. While the younger <br />
buck knew he couldn't match him in strength, and the younger buck didn't have the size <br />
to throw the scarred rival like the no-longer-doe had that rival, each attack was the same. <br />
And unlike the four leg bucks, the younger buck was two legs, and thus was quite a bit <br />
better at learning quickly.  <br />
<br />
When the scarred rival charged next, the younger buck dropped as low he could, and stuck <br />
his antlers upwards. <br />
<br />
The younger buck's antlers stabbed past the skin of the larger buck, the force letting him <br />
stab deeply. However, the scarred rival didn't cry out. Jeremy almost shook his head, had <br />
he, had he killed him?! Oh no, oh-' <br />
<br />
 Jeremy felt two muscular hands with armored finger tips grab him by the shoulders, which <br />
pulled his antlers away from the bleeding holes in the larger buck's chest, giving him a full <br />
view of something he'd rather never see close up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bout time you noticed.&quot; He heard Spike whisper, just as Jeremy felt his body being lifted <br />
off the ground. <br />
<br />
'He, he -let- me stab him, just so he could get close enough to grab me!'<br />
<br />
Spike was dangerous. He must have predicted, or gambled, on how Jeremy would place his <br />
antlers to intercept! Spike was willing to gamble everything to gain everything, this make <br />
him incredibly dangerous. <br />
<br />
&quot;How.&quot; Jeremy had just enough time to get out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Behold the wonders of nature's invention the rib cage.&quot; <br />
<br />
And Jeremy was throw heads over hooves, hearing the slightest crack in one of his antlers <br />
as he hit the ground, kicking up dirt and grass. Somehow safely landing on his back, <br />
feeling none too comfortable on his tail, he looked up at the sky, and soon enough was <br />
staring up into Spike's eyes. &quot;That Kung-Fu?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kenpo. Get up.&quot; Spike said simply. <br />
<br />
Without a second thought, Jeremy obeyed, in a heart beat Lance was his side helping him <br />
stand and letting the superior buck lean on him as Jeremy got his bearings. <br />
<br />
Jeremy kept looking into Spike's eyes, and finally, just lowered his head. Lance helped him <br />
over to the group of the bucks who had been beaten by both Jeremy and Spike accepting <br />
him with open arms. Jeremy knew what he was feeling, as far as the frat, no, the HERD was <br />
concerned, Spike was his superior. <br />
<br />
Spike looked at Sam. Then Spike looked at his own chest and the holes in his skin left by <br />
Jeremy. He looked at Sam again. &quot;Looks like you're at an advantage.&quot; For some reason, <br />
Sam didn't believe that. &quot;We shouldn't keep the does waiting. Shall we begin?&quot; Still in that <br />
cool, calm voice. He truly did act more like a buck on two legs than a human given half a <br />
deer's DNA. <br />
<br />
This was it, Sam and Spike were now the most highest ranking bucks in the herd. The <br />
group mentality of the deer combined with the sociological habits of the primate. They <br />
effective now had an equal amount of respect and loyalty from the rest. But there was <br />
room for only one at the top.</p>
