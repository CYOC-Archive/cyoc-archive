<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Penn had no idea what was going on but she was loving every second of it. One second she was a man in an alleyway fucking an absolute hottie and the next moment she was a woman in white and transported into a room where woman in matching dresses she didn’t know were fixing her dress, hair, and veil. She had turned into a bride, that childish desire she had gotten as a boy and been teased for over the years. It had become buried, a thought that came up when she masturbated but now she was there, a gorgeous woman in beautiful white. Bridesmaids who clearly knew her and other people she didn’t recognize telling her a wait time for walking down the aisle. It made her horny and excited. Her vagina just throbbed as she lived her greatest fantasy. She smiled and giggled and everyone smiled back likely thinking she was happy because she was marrying “the love of her life” she didn’t even know the guy so he wasn’t important. It was only the dress, the aisle, and everything associated with the wedding day. After that ended she would need to find that stripper again and turn back into herself. Or maybe beg to be put back in the bridal situation. Either would work.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t long before a man said it was time. She had the veil pulled over her head and was led out of the room and handed a bouquet with absolutely breathtaking royal blue flowers in it. She smiled even more broadly than before as an older man took her arm, probably the father of the body she was in. She was led down the aisle to a waiting party of people. Her heels clicked, her breasts wanted to bounce and jiggle, and her as swayed back and forth sexily. She just grinned even broader than before as she realized how much more sexy this was than any of her past fantasies. Step by step she made her way to the end of the aisle and her eyes fell on a smartly dressed man with blonde hair. Part of her was revolted but another part was super excited to have vows read towards this man. She had no attraction whatsoever to him despite the fact she was about to get married to him.<br />
<br />
They stood up at the end of the hall and a priest read out the ceremonies. Every single wish Penn had ever had since he first saw a wedding on television was coming true. Her father beating him and telling him men didn’t have such fantasies was wrong, her sister calling him gay was wrong, and most of all her mother cackling and telling all her friends and teasing him about having to find a man into transvestites was wrong. Penn was a bride and she even had vows. They were tied to her bouquet so she wouldn’t forget them and the man slipped a ring on her finger that was beautiful in every way possible. She slipped one on his finger and the priest said he could now kiss the bride. Penn’s heart fluttered as the world confirmed she was in fact a bride. The man kissed her and the ceremony ended with them walking down the aisle together.<br />
<br />
Except things didn’t stop there. They were in the front of the church and got greeted by every single person handing them a congratulations. People she didn’t know talked to her like an old friend, family recalled memories she didn’t have, and everyone wanted a picture taken with a blinding flash. Penn just smiled at all of them giddy that she got to flaunt being a bride for a little bit longer. Pictures were taken outside of the church before the two of them stepped into a limousine and the door was shut  cutting them off from the crowd. She stared out the window as they rolled past and her face fell a little as her time as a bride dwindled. Instead she turned curiously to the limo and looked around, she’d never been in such an expensive vehicle, a glorified taxi cab.<br />
<br />
She was startled out of this by a crack like a gunshot and turned to see the blonde man who was now her husband having just popped the cork off a bottle of champagne. Penn watched it pour into very specific glasses for champagne before she was handed one.<br />
<br />
“To a happy marriage, and no cringe inducing moments from my mother tonight,” Her husband announced and Penn just swallowed and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Uh... Here here,” she replied with after a few seconds and they tapped glasses together. Penn watched as her husband just took a small sip, nothing like drinking alcohol she was used to. Usually you downed it as fast as possible so you could get drunk. So she delicately touched her lips to the glass and took a small sip letting the champagne flow down her throat. After she was done she turned to see her husband looking at her with a smile on his face. She blinked and looked back and forth in confusion, “What?”<br />
<br />
“You look so beautiful today,” he commented and she blushed in response. He slid over to her and put a hand behind her head ruffling some of her hair in the process. She blushed heavily as he delicately pulled her forward before delivering a passionate kiss to her lips. They held it, broke it, then had another, and another, and another. Penn wasn’t even sure why she was participating but suddenly the champagne was put down and she was clutching him and kissing him at the same time. It felt nice and pleasant, an added bonus from her day as a bride, brides kissed and this just made her feel hot and horny as it tapped into her fetish.<br />
<br />
The kissing ended however when they reached the reception hall and more of her fantasy cane to fruition. She arrived to clapping, had several lame speeches directed at her, and got to smash cake in her husband’s face. Each one made her hornier than the last. She felt like she was spending the whole day jerking off. All that sperm shot out of her dick had been for this dream, this fantasy and as she down alcohol, threw her boquet, and danced with her husband in a wedding dress she got to the point where she needed release, to wake up in her man’s body and jerk off at the memories of the day. She and her husband got in the limo again half drunk and she peeled off her heels while giggling when they entered it ready to wake up. She made out passionately with him again and they arrived at a house, fully furnished and clearly lived in for a few years. A man and a woman had lived here and she realized it must have been her and her husband trying out life together before they got married. He led her to a bedroom and dropped her down on the bed while she giggled. He told her not to move and removed his tie. It was here that Penn’s facefinally fell as she realized what was about to happen. What did couples do on their wedding night? They fucked. He was just getting off to the wedding portion, sex as a woman wouldn’t work, it just seemed gross and unnatural. Penn swallowed nervously as her husband removed his suit jacket and turned to her.<br />
<br />
“So Mrs. Penelope Grant, ready to make our marriage official?” He asked.<br />
<br />
His response was awkward stuttering as piece by piece his clothing fell to the floor until Penn was staring at a completely nude man with a raging erection.<br />
<br />
“I um... dress,” Penn replied but apparently that wasn’t a good answer because she was turned around, unzipped, and slipped from the dress in seconds. It fell off leaving her in underwear and all her husband had to do was unclasp a class between the cups of the bra and do the same thing to the side of the panties. Her breasts bounced freely and her Vagina was wet from her day of living out a fantasy. Her husband got really excited at this and immediately slipped a condom on and without hesitation gently lowered her onto the sheets before he slowly and methodically enter her wet vagina. A female orgasm wracked her almost instantly and he began to thrust slowly in and out of her body dragging out each pleasurable throb blissfully.<br />
<br />
Penn moaned and was cut off by her husband pressing his lips against hers and breaking her tongue through her lips. She automatically began to return the favour while he thrust methodically and slowly into her. They broke the kiss and he looked her in the eyes with a smile.<br />
<br />
“That fee good?”<br />
<br />
She nodded.<br />
<br />
“Bit faster or is this good?”<br />
<br />
“F-f-“ She started intending to swear but he immediately began to thrust faster and her eyes went wide as his cock worked around her genitals. Not only was it a nicely sized cock but he knew how to use it, he even seemed to know that her body responded better to certain movements. This wasn’t their first time having sex but it was pleasurable all the same. His hands began to knead her breasts and she wrapped her legs around him as well as her arms while he continued to thrust increasing in speed an intensity every few seconds. It felt so nice, so sensual, and so joy inducing that her fetish of being a bride was overtaken by this cock. She began to smile as her tongue hung out and bliss wrote itself all over her face. She didn’t want to become a man and jack off to these memories anymore. She wanted to be Mrs. Penelope Grant and do whatever she did and  interact with whomever she interacted with. This cock, this man, and this life seemed perfect. She came several times and it seemed her husband was holding back, at least until his dick started throbbing and the condom inflated like a water balloon prompting another orgasm.<br />
<br />
“We’re doing that every night of the honeymoon,” He explained as they cuddled a few minutes later under the bedsheets. Their sweaty scents mingling and making Penelope cuddle even closer. She shut her eyes and smiled looking forward to it.</p>
