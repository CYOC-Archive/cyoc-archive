<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Instinct threatens to tear Carrie's mind apart. In particular, the fight or flight instinct is raging. As Carrie complete her change into that of a donkey, she felt something change within her. Human instinct and mentality almost switched off to be replaced with those of a donkey.<br />
<br />
Carrie finds herself bombarded with voices of sorts, screaming at her to get out of there. Her human knowledge is intact enough for her to know that this place somehow caused her to change.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Carrie, the donkey side of her just wants to get out. It doesn’t care how she gets out or what she'll do after, it just wants her to flee!<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay right where you are donkey. You're my property now!&quot; The barkeeper says.<br />
<br />
Carrie brays at the man. She isn't about to let him tell her what to do. Before the man can do anything else, Carrie bolts for the exit. The change into donkey has perhaps one blessing. The command in her mind to make her legs run now functions for four legs rather then two.<br />
<br />
With her hooves clomping against the ground, Carrie bursts outside, braying as though on autopilot. Carrie realises that she's not saying anything per say, she's just making noise, something that the new way of thinking trying to overwhelm her seems satisfied to do.<br />
<br />
Outside, Carrie sees John. She runs up to him and brays. Terror is trying to overwhelm her, when John speaks; Carrie's situation only hits her even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carrie, oh my God, is that you? I'm sorry for panicking back there. What ... holy shit, you're a donkey. What are we, oh my God!&quot; John says.<br />
<br />
Carrie begins to realise the privileges of being human, or at least humanoid. Without the ability to speak, she has little in the way of expressing herself. Feeling sadness over this, Carrie lowers her ears without thinking about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right, we'll find a way around this. There must be a cure for you,&quot; John says.<br />
<br />
Carrie looks up at John, she sees that besides his donkey ears, fur is growing on his face. Carrie is desperate to say something but her donkey body betrays her. Something else forms from within Carrie. She finds a part of her wants John to change all of the way so she can have a companion.<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, Carrie knows that it's just instinct and a herd mentality making her think those thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;My face is warm. Oh no, it must be spreading! Come on, we have to get help!&quot; John says.<br />
<br />
Carrie knows this but she's finding the desire to see John as a donkey grow stronger. Knowing she really is a donkey and that she'll have far less responsibilities this way, a permanent vacation of sorts is starting to excite her. She licks at his crotch, hoping to trigger more changes in John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carrie, what are you doing?&quot; John asks.<br />
<br />
Carrie brays and shakes her head. She knows that this isn't right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Carry stay with me, don't let it win!&quot; John says.<br />
<br />
Carrie nods her head. The duo walk down the street, looking for someone that might help then. Carrie can smell that John's scent is changing. Even if he doesn’t know it, his body is shifting under his clothes. She can smell his fur growing in. It gives her joy to think that she'll soon have another donkey to be with her. She thinks of how handsome John will be as a donkey.<br />
<br />
John starts to itch as his shirt. Carrie wants him to take it off so she can see the fur on his chest. She knows she's not thinking rationally and the donkey mentality is messing with her thoughts. She tries to think human thoughts, of what she looked like as a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, I think it's reached my...&quot;<br />
<br />
John leads Carrie into an alley. Carrie looks as John undoes his pants and pulls them down along with his underwear. What Carrie sees excites her.<br />
<br />
John's legs are fur covered and what's between his legs is darkening and lengthening at the same time. Carrie cannot help but bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling daring, Carrie walks over and licks John's changing member. John gasps and looks at Carrie.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I ... we have to resist it ... we HAWWWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
John grabs his mouth, leaving Carrie to stare at John's member. She gets more excited as it takes on a form that is closer with each second to one that will be suited for her. She wants to be in a field alone with John, or at least with other donkeys. He'll be a strong donkey, an excellent leader for a herd they can start.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carrie, I ... I don't think I can control it. I ... so hard to think. Easier to just ... bray. Hawwwwwww He hawwwww.&quot;<br />
<br />
John shakes his head, but Carrie can see that there is a part of him that doesn’t want to stop braying or to stop these changes. If they've truly stumbled onto a real version of Pleasure Island, Carrie can tell that John is considering staying rather then trying to escape.<br />
<br />
Carrie sees that John's member is as long as a donkey's, heck it *is* a donkey's. It stands proud and seeming to call for her. If Carrie were still human what she was considering would disgust her. However in her current form, John's member is just what she wants.<br />
<br />
John gasps as Carry starts to lick and suck on him as much as she can. His changes accelerate as his face begins to pull out into a muzzle while his hair becomes a mane that looks almost like a mohawk. This changes his scent, which only invigorates Carrie. As John's body begins to expand, his shirt rips to reveal a hairy belly.<br />
<br />
Having crossed a line of which there is no apparent return, Carrie stops sucking and stands back to await John becoming his handsome donkey self.<br />
<br />
Even if she could think clearly, her lust is in control. Soon, John is as much donkey as she is with his tattered shirt on his back.<br />
<br />
Carrie poins her rump at him and raises her tail, ready for John. She knows that what she’s doing is immoral but she can’t bring herself to care. Carrie gasps as she feels John mount her. Knowing he’s going to do it just excites her more! She wants him more then anything now. She brays at him, wishing she could speak so she could tell him to go on ahead.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Carrie, raising her tail was enough of a signal. She feels him thrust himself into her. Both donkeys bray as pleasure courses through their bodies. It lasts and lasts for what feels like hours before Carrie feels John explode inside of her, the warm liquid tickling and stimulating her.<br />
<br />
As John withdraws, Carrie feels exhausted. She lies down, John lying beside her. Soon, both are asleep.</p>
