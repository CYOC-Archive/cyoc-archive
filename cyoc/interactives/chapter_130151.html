<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was feeling a lot better about my immediate future as I found the blouse and skirt that Zach had suggested I wear to work. Once dressed I went down to the kitchen where &#39;Mum&#39; was already eating her breakfast. I had heard my temporary &#39;Dad&#39; singing in the shower as I walked past what must be the Master bedroom. Zach said his usual breakfast was a bowl of Muesli and a glass of fruit juice. I had scouted the kitchen last night while helping clean up after dinner so knew where to find what I needed.<br />
&#39;Mum&#39; greeted me with a &quot;Good morning Sarah&quot;<br />
&quot;Morning Mum&quot; I replied. &#39;Mum&#39; was a part time librarian at the council library and from her attire it appeared she must be working today.<br />
&quot;Are you home for dinner tonight?&quot; She asked as I prepared my cereal. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m visiting Rod after work I replied. I&#39;ll plan to have dinner with him&quot;<br />
&quot;Try to get home at a decent time. You are looking tired and I am worried about you. You did not seem your normal happy self last night. Is there something I should know?&quot;<br />
No doubt I looked embarrassed. But what could I say. For I was not actually her daughter, I was a male friend wearing her body. <br />
I quickly changed the subject, saying I had to be at work early, gulped down my breakfast and hurried back to my room.<br />
I found myself crying as I sat on the bed. I was not used to deceiving people and I&#39;m sure these damn female hormones were not helping either.<br />
Eventually the tears stopped. I went to the bathroom, brushed my hair and applied make-up as Zach and demonstrated yesterday. Again I was amazed that I actually did a pretty good job. The girl who looked back at me from the mirror looked very business like.<br />
I grabbed Sarah&#39;s handbag, checked keys, purse and other necessities were in there. I called out &quot;Bye Mum&quot; as I left and  heaved a sigh of relief once I was in the car.<br />
           ..............<br />
As I drove to Sarah&#39;s workplace I recalled what Zach had told me yesterday. Evidently everyone at the dealership wore name tags so my anxiety about not knowing my workmates was reduced. Zach had suggested I quickly locate a blond woman named Marlene who would be my boss. My duties would be answering the phone and doing odd jobs that Marlene would assign. Zach said a likeable girl called Karen was also on Marlene&#39;s team but to watch out for a salesman called Mitch who was sleazy.<br />
I found a spot at the back of the dealership carpark and summoned the courage to face this next challenge. I was 10 minutes earlier than Zach had suggested I arrive but there were other people already  inside the showroom, so I thought &#39;no time like the present&#39; and went in.<br />
Inside were a couple of middle aged men looking at one of the display cars. They greeted me with &quot;Good morning Sarah&quot; <br />
I replied with a generic &quot;Good Morning&quot; to them. <br />
I tried to recall the building layout. I had been here as a customer several years ago and could recall there was a customer lounge to the left where you could make a coffee. I thought I could wait there until I found Marlene. As I was looking around I noticed a toilet sign and thought that might be a good idea, my bladder was feeling full. I entered, found a stall, did my business and took the opportunity to change pads. As I was washing my hands I heard the door open and close behind me.<br />
I turned around and there was one of the men who had greeted me earlier. I looked at his name tag he was &quot;Mitch&quot;.<br />
&quot;Fancy seeing you in here Sarah. You do realize this is the males customers toilet. I will have to report you&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm.. Sorry, my mistake, I was in a hurry&quot; I tried to walk past him but he blocked my way. He was probably only 6ft but solid. He seemed huge compared to my new body.<br />
&quot;I might be able to overlook this indiscretion, but see you don&#39;t do it again&quot; He stepped aside and I made for the door. Suddenly he grabbed my waist firmly and turned me around to face him. &quot;I think I deserve a thank-you kiss. don&#39;t you?&quot; I could see no way out. He lifted me up and kissed me on the mouth. He was obviously a smoker and it felt disgusting. He put me down, gave a chuckle and let me go. I walked out as quickly as I could, thinking this was not the start to the day that I wanted.<br />
<br />
After that episode the rest of the day was easy. Marlene was entering the building as I returned to the display room. She greeted me with a friendly smile that soothed my nerves. My task for the morning was a stock-take of leaflets for all the different cars. Karen my colleague manned the front desk and answered incoming phone calls. I was to take over the desk after lunch. <br />
Karen invited me to lunch with her and I took up the offer. We walked a short distance to a café and had a light meal. She was full of questions about my weekend and how the family dinner had gone.<br />
I had a couple more encounters with Mitch but had learned my lesson and made sure we were never alone. In the company of others he was very polite and businesslike. I learned he was the companies top salesman.<br />
At 5 O&#39;clock Marlene said I could go. So I quickly grabbed my stuff and hurried out to the car before I could be trapped by Mitch again.<br />
I drove straight around to Rod&#39;s</p>
