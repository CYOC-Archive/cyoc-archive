<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt felt a shiver of anticipation as he selected a package titled &quot;Sentient and animated power assault armor&quot;. It was an odd option, sure, but Matt found himself inexplicably drawn to it. He took a deep breath and clicked &quot;apply&quot;. <br />
<br />
Instantly he felt a strange sensation in his feet. He looked down and saw his toes merging together, a metallic sheen spreading over them. He gasped as his feet swelled and reshaped, forming into solid, heavy boot-like structures. He felt his bones shifting, his muscles changing, the sensation not exactly painful but intensely strange and deeply arousing.<br />
<br />
Next came his legs, the metal creeping up over his shins and then his thighs, each part of him reshaping and merging into the armor. His flesh was replaced by thick, solid plates of metal, complete with complex mechanical details. His legs now looked like they belonged to a walking tank, bulky and powerful.<br />
<br />
He groaned in pleasure as the transformation hit his crotch and bottom. His genitals vanished, replaced with a smooth, seamless piece of metal. His butt reshaped into a solid, curved plate of armor, and he could feel his insides shifting, his organs changing, becoming something other than flesh and blood.<br />
<br />
His chest and arms followed suit, his body growing larger and heavier but still maintaining a distinctly humanoid shape. His fingers grew into sturdy, articulated gauntlets, and he could see a myriad of small lights and dials littered across his new body.<br />
<br />
Lastly came his head. He could feel his face stretching, his mouth disappearing. His eyes were replaced with a glowing visor, and he could feel his brain changing, his thoughts becoming code, becoming digital. His voice, when he spoke, was no longer his own but a computerized voice. &quot;Transformation... progress... complete,&quot; he said, the words coming out clipped and mechanical.<br />
<br />
But still, despite his new form, Matt was still Matt. He could still feel pleasure, still feel arousal, even though he had no physical body to experience it with. He was still him, just... different. <br />
<br />
&quot;Query,&quot; he said, a strange sensation of happiness welling up in his electronic mind. &quot;Transformed... affirmative. Satisfaction... affirmative.&quot; He was a powerful, sentient armor now, a walking tank, a body of metal and lights. But despite that, he was still the same submissive gay guy he had always been, just with a new form to enjoy. And he was more than okay with that.<br />
<br />
When Paul walked into their shared apartment after a long day at work, he froze in his tracks at the sight of his lover. &quot;Matt?&quot; He questioned, uncertainty etching his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative, Paul,&quot; Matt&#39;s mechanized voice echoed back. The sound was cold and mechanical, but the voice patterns were distinctly Matt&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Paul approached slowly, his eyes wide with fascination as he took in the sight of Matt&#39;s transformed body. It was a strange sight, to be sure, but also undeniably arousing. He reached out, hesitantly, to touch the cool metal surface of Matt&#39;s chest plate. &quot;Can you... turn back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Reversal... possible,&quot; Matt replied, the sound of his voice sending shivers down Paul&#39;s spine. There was something oddly erotic about hearing his lover&#39;s voice through the synthetic modulations. <br />
<br />
A sudden, wild thought entered Paul&#39;s mind, and before he could second-guess it, he was voicing it aloud. &quot;Can I... wear you?&quot; Paul asked, his cheeks flushing with the audacity of the question.<br />
<br />
Matt paused for a moment, before responding. &quot;Affirmative. User interface... possible. Pleasure sensors... active.&quot; The fact that Paul was interested in his new form thrilled Matt. The thought of being used, of being worn by his lover, sent a pulse of digital pleasure through his circuits.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s eyes widened as he took in the implications of Matt&#39;s words. The idea of wearing his lover, of feeling what he felt, brought a rush of arousal. With a shaky breath, he reached out to touch the armor again. &quot;Let&#39;s... let&#39;s do this then.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative, Paul... Proceeding with user interface,&quot; Matt responded, his lights flickering in anticipation. He was ready to experience this new form of intimacy with his lover. There was no telling what new pleasures awaited them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul,&quot; Matt&#39;s digitized voice echoed, &quot;user must be... undressed.&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul nodded, understanding. He began to remove his clothes, each piece of fabric discarded onto the floor until he stood naked before the sentient armor. Matt, in turn, reached up and carefully removed his helmet, holding it in a gauntleted hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Preparing for user interface,&quot; Matt announced. The front of his body began to split, seams appearing and then widening to create an opening. The sight was surreal, yet Paul couldn&#39;t deny the arousal coursing through him.<br />
<br />
Cautiously, he stepped forward, his bare feet touching the cool metal floor of the armor. He shivered at the sensation, the cold against his warm skin sending jolts of pleasure through his body. He moved further inside, his entire body now encased in the metal shell.<br />
<br />
Inside of Matt, the surface wasn&#39;t harsh metal as he&#39;d expected. Instead, it was a soft, gel-like substance that felt strangely alive. It molded around him, creating a perfect fit. Every inch of his skin was in contact with the gel, and the sensation was unlike anything Paul had ever experienced. It was both soothing and stimulating, the gentle pressure of the gel providing a constant source of arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for... helmet interface,&quot; Matt intoned, his voice sounding directly in Paul&#39;s mind now. He held the helmet out with a steady hand, waiting for Paul&#39;s nod of affirmation.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, Paul nodded. &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; he whispered, his voice filled with anticipation. Matt moved the helmet towards him, placing it carefully onto his head. Instantly, the world around him shifted. He could see through Matt&#39;s eyes, feel through his body. He was no longer just Paul, he was Matt too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interface... complete,&quot; Matt&#39;s voice echoed in his mind, the words sending a rush of pleasure through their shared form. This was a new level of intimacy, a new way of being together that neither of them could have imagined before. And it was only just the beginning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt... I need to...&quot; Paul trailed off, a blush rising on his face. Even though he was inside the armor now, he still felt a bit bashful admitting his needs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Pleasure request... understood,&quot; Matt responded. He could feel Paul&#39;s arousal, could feel Paul&#39;s need. It was a strange sensation, being the source of someone else&#39;s pleasure, but not an unpleasant one.<br />
<br />
Inside the armor, the gel surface began to move, sending waves of pleasure through Paul&#39;s body. It was like a hundred hands touching him at once, each one expertly manipulating his sensitive skin. His breath hitched as the gel moved over his erection, a gasp falling from his lips as it began to stroke him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt...&quot; he breathed out, his fingers curving against the inner surface of the armor. He could feel everything, could feel Matt around him, inside him. It was a unique and overwhelming sensation, one that was quickly pushing him towards the edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Pleasure... increasing,&quot; Matt&#39;s voice echoed in his mind. It was a promise, a pledge. Paul could feel his body responding, his pleasure mounting as the armor responded to his needs.<br />
<br />
He gave himself over to the sensation, to the pleasure Matt was offering him. It was a new experience, a new form of intimacy. And as he reached his climax, he knew it was one he wanted to explore further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Initiate... clean-up,&quot; Matt&#39;s voice echoed inside the helmet as Paul shuddered with the aftershocks of his climax. The gel began to move again, this time in a gentle, sweeping motion that quickly removed all traces of Paul&#39;s release. <br />
<br />
It was an odd sensation, the gel moving over him in the aftermath of his pleasure. It felt soothing, almost comforting. As the gel finished its task, Paul was left feeling clean and refreshed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clean-up... complete,&quot; Matt&#39;s voice intoned. The fact that Matt could take care of him in such a manner, even in this transformed state, brought a soft smile to Paul&#39;s face.<br />
As he basked in the afterglow of his pleasure, a thought suddenly struck Paul. &quot;Matt,&quot; he began, &quot;could I use the Chronivac? Could I become something... else, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Chronivac... accessible to all,&quot; Matt replied, his electronic voice filling their shared mindspace. &quot;What form... do you desire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul was silent for a moment, his mind running through a myriad of options. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he admitted finally. &quot;There&#39;s so much to choose from. Maybe something like you, or... I don&#39;t know, a dragon, a werewolf, a piece of art, a tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. All options... possible. Choice... yours.&quot; Matt&#39;s voice carried a note of amusement. It was a strange experience, being the one to guide Paul in his transformational exploration. But he welcomed it. After all, they were both adventurers in this new and exciting world they&#39;d stumbled upon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we could... take turns,&quot; Paul suggested, his voice filled with excitement. &quot;We could try different things, see what we like best. It could be... fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Affirmative. Proposal... accepted. Excitement... shared,&quot; Matt responded, and it was true. The thought of exploring this new world of transformation together was an exciting one. They were on the cusp of a brand new adventure, and they were more than ready to take it on together.</p>
