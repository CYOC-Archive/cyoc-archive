<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The masseur kept rubbing oil into Demetrius&#39; temples.  He has switched to one which smelled more earthy and musky, with definite overtones of masculine sweat.  &quot;This should help our wrestler remember his place!&quot;<br />
The masseur whispered into Demetrius&#39; ear: &quot;What is your name, noble warrior?&quot;<br />
In a deep, rich voice Demetrius responded: &quot;I...I do not know.&quot;<br />
&quot;My boy, you took a heavy blow in the Palé! Focus, your name is Demetrius. Do you remember it now?&quot; <br />
&quot;Demetrius?&quot; In his mind, Demetrius felt like something was wrong... that he hadn&#39;t been called that before.  What was he called?<br />
&quot;Your name is Demetrius...your name is Demetrius....Demetrius... say it with me boy!&quot;<br />
&quot;My name is De......De...metrius.  Demetrius.  I am Demetrius.&quot; Each time he said it, it felt more right and he felt more assured that he WAS Demetrius.<br />
&quot;Remember you have been in my wrestling gymnos since you were but a callow youth of 8, you are 21 now.&quot;<br />
Demetrius felt confused.  Wasn&#39;t he 15? Or was he in his 21st summer?  <br />
&quot;I am not 21 I&#39;m only 15...&quot;<br />
The masseuse laughed (and poured more oil on Demetrius&#39; scalp): &quot;Look at yourself Demetrius, you haven&#39;t been 15 for many a summer now, not with a beard, muscles or a cock like that!&quot; <br />
Demetrius opened his eyes and looked at himself for the first time.  He could see his beautiful beard flowing onto his broad chest that many a woman and man had said was as big as that of Hercules.  Below the curve of his pectorals  rose his potent phallis, with its beautifully smooth glans that was a ruddy colour and glistening with musky precum.  Clearly the masseuse was right, this wasn&#39;t the body of any &quot;callow youth!&quot;<br />
&quot;I am of 21 summers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank the Gods, your mind isn&#39;t damaged!  Now just lay back and relax Demetrius, and let me help relax you.  Just let your thoughts drift and if you want, sleep.  You will need a day of rest, but I think you will be well for the Games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Demetrius began to drift back off  and his thoughts began to become jumbled.  Demetrius again noticed a powerful heaviness in his phallus and he desired to stroke his cock, but he didn&#39;t have the energy to move.  He noticed that his body was giving off a wonderful odor, a smell he remembered well, the smell he and the other men had after wrestling.  The musky scent of his manhood and pits filled his mind with strange images: of high-born women in rare silks and jewels revealing their supple tits for him to gaze upon; of sweaty bearded men wrestling nude in the Palé, battling for supremacy.  More images: of laying atop a supple young highborn woman fucking her with wanton abandon, trying to impregnate her for the sake of her elderly husband that he might have an &quot;heir&quot; her subtle moans making his cock harder than it had ever been before; of laying in his chambers with Aias kissing him and feeling his muscles press against his while they both stroked each other&#39;s cocks.  <br />
<br />
While Demetrius was having these thoughts, the masseuse was stroking Demetrius&#39; cock and also speaking to Demetrius.<br />
&quot;Remember fucking the noble woman with the beautiful breasts, of being in love with Aias and desiring high born men and women.&quot;<br />
&quot;You love being powerful Demetrius, being dominant, being a wrestling champion.  You love to fuck, you love being an man and everything that makes you male pleases you.  You love your musk, it makes you feel powerful and aroused. &quot;<br />
<br />
In Demetrius&#39; overwhelmed mind, he did not hear the massuse&#39;s words, but saw them instead as images: he was thinking of how he loved pinning men in the Palé, and how he loved to fuck them as his reward!  He remembered the moves that made him victorious and felt a tingle in his muscles as muscle memory took hold.  Demetrius was ready for the ring!<br />
<br />
His scent grew stronger, like that of man who had fucked all day and was laying back on his palate, with his arms behind his head letting his musk fill the room.  Demetrius&#39; thoughts grew more focused as the masseuse stroked and as he became more aware of the scent of sex.  He saw flashes of sex scenes that he now knew were from his past; the night he lost his virginity to a slave girl, the noble woman who paid for him to fuck her after he won against her champion, the first time he placed another wrestler&#39;s phallus in his mouth and savored his manhood, the first time he and Aias rutted together.  More thoughts, of shaving for the first time, of noticing his developing muscles and musk and the hair on his chest, the first time he pinned the captain of the Palé, of being named their ring&#39;s champion to go to Athens for the Olympiad.<br />
<br />
All these things became real in Demetrius&#39; mind and he felt overjoyed.  <br />
<br />
At that moment, he felt his cock explode in the most intense orgasm he&#39;d ever felt.  It felt like everything was realigning in his mind, like his thoughts were becoming clear from a long sleep.  His orgasm continued on for what felt like minutes (Demetrius&#39; first thought was one of pride at how prodigius his orgasm was!) and as it ended he felt his foreskin covering his gland which was slick with his seed.  Demetrius chuckled to himself knowing how masculine that would smell in the morning when he would first go to train with Aias! Perhaps they would do more than train.... heh!<br />
<br />
The masseuse held a small amphore in line with Demetrius&#39; pulsing cock to catch the wrestler&#39;s potent seed.  &quot;This will earn us much silver from the temple priests who will spill it on their altars!&quot; <br />
<br />
Just as his orgasm completed, Demetrius opened his eyes...</p>
