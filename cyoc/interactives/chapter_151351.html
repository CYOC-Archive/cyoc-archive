<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walk slowly into the rather sleazy and crowded speakeasy. You distinctly remember reading a bit about these places, one of the few parts of history class you found interesting. Gangsters and other crooks bunched up in secret pubs to drink does have a certain mystic and romanticism to it. <br />
<br />
However the actual place is somewhat more underwhelming than you&#39;d expect. It certainly does seem interesting, shady deals and sleazy individuals huddle around tables. However other then that it simply seems like a particularly smoky closed in bar.  Not overly much different than when you first went to a bar for your 18th birthday, so long as you ignore the criminals of course, and also your new gender. <br />
<br />
Deciding all of this still too unfamiliar however, you cannot simply forget you&#39;re in a room full of crooks, nearly a century in the past and a somehow now a woman, you begin walking to a free sofa in a corner. As you walk you can&#39;t help by give you hips a slight sway, despite your internal embarrassment, much be something with this body you decide. <br />
<br />
Eventually you reach the sofa and sit down, it&#39;s somewhat stained with smoke but it&#39;s relatively good comfort. You sit down in what you recognise is a somewhat feminie posture. You don&#39;t have time to think about it too much though as the Doctor&#39;s voice suddenly comes in through your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good data so far, keep it up. Just keep blending in and go with the flow, my device will help you along&quot;, you blind in response to the doctor&#39;s message but try not to show your surprise on your face as you discreetly look around, determining that only you could hear the doctor. After that, his message puts you at ease somewhat. Just go with the flow and let him collect his data. He&#39;s obviously got everything handled, you just decide to sit here for now.<br />
<br />
Your quiet hiding place is suddenly torn from you by the arrival of a younger looking gangster, he seems to be in his twenties by your observation. He seems to be smiling while leering at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what&#39;s a fine dame like you doing in a place like this&quot; he says while taking a seat near you. As much as you want to show your displeasure at him, roll your eyes and tell him to kindly buzz off. Your memory of the doctor&#39;s recent words echo in your mind and you get a feeling that it may be better to just play along. It&#39;s not like this will amount to anything anyway.. right?<br />
<br />
Struggling inside, you put on a surprisingly genuine looking smile aimed at him and respond, thinking up explanations as you go &quot;I&#39;m something of a singer, mister. I was lucky enough to get invited to sing down here, gigs can be hard to come by.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The man proceeds to give a look of faux disbelief &quot;For you? Well you sound like you would have an absolutely heavenly singing voice miss, I&#39;m sure if those palookas knew what they were missing out on then they would be lining up to have you sing at their places.&quot; despite yourself you can&#39;t help but blush at his comment. You want to shake it off but can&#39;t as you have to quickly come up with a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw shucks mister. You really know how to make a gal feel welcomed&quot; At the back of your mind you briefly notice this responses are becoming easier and more natural, but the gangster responds before you can ponder that further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just telling that truth as I see it. Name&#39;s Jimmy McCoy, may I know yours?&quot; he asks with a smile which somewhat makes you blush even more, <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh of course.. uh&quot; you quickly have to come up with a name, luckily it seems Jimmy over there seems to believe your pause is due to getting over your blush, not because you need to actually invent a name &quot;Name&#39;s Anna.. Graven hon. Now with introductions outta the way why don&#39;t you take a turn telling me what a fine fella such as yourself is doing in a place like this.&quot; You&#39;re now increasingly noticing how natural the words coming out of your mouth are, part of you feels like leaving to work this out, however that would be difficult with Jimmy here.<br />
<br />
Jimmy gives a small, yet good natured and amused, chuckle at having his own question be turned back at him &quot;Oh just a minor associate of the fine gentlemen who run this legitimate venture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about that makes you gives a friendly giggle of your own to him before you respond without even taking any time to think of what to say &quot;Oh how fancy, I&#39;ve always wanted to meet a big bad associate, always wondered if you live up your name&quot; you speak in a rather flirty tone, shocking yourself inside, although its become easy to not show out outside, with it instead shifting into a flirty expression.<br />
<br />
He seems to appreciate your  tone as he responds with a flirty smile of his own &quot;Well I&#39;m sure I can show you over a drink, on me of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
You give him a small smile &quot;That would be lovely, but I&#39;m afraid I have a gig soon and don&#39;t want to have too much to drink before it.&quot; despite that simply being an excuse to get out, you don&#39;t manage to sound genuinely disappoint.<br />
<br />
Jimmy seems disappointed as well &quot;Ah damn. But fair. But hey, these current acts are still going to be a good while, plenty of time to just chat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Internally you curse at your failed attempt at an out, you consider simply making an excuse, such as checking your makeup or something, but before you can think you suddenly start speaking &quot;Well that sounds positively lovely. Maybe even see the man behind the suit if you know what I mean&quot; you give a flirty grin and seductive wink without thinking.<br />
<br />
As you are trying to figure out what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s Jimmy&#39;s turn to blush, although he quickly gets his bearing back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not a drink, but that does sound rather appealing Miss Graven.&quot; He says, seemingly giving into the advances you can&#39;t resist making.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please call me Anna. No need to be so formal Jimmy&quot; you say, again without even thinking about it beforehand while also speaking quite seductively with a flirty grin.<br />
<br />
Jimmy tugs the edge of his collar while blushing &quot;Is it just me or is it getting hot in here all of a sudden&quot;.<br />
<br />
You giggle at his embarrassment and go and tug at his collar yourself &quot;Not yet cutie. But why don&#39;t you go join me in the makeup rooms before my act, for good luck&quot; you then get up and finally manage to leave. You begin walking to the entrance to the makeup rooms, you somewhat notice that your hips seem to be swaying much more this time, particularly in the direction of Jimmy. <br />
<br />
On one hand you are wondering what your doing, on the other hand you feel in a daze somewhat as you go with the flow of these feelings. You head is in too much of a dizzy to work out anything so you keep walking in the same seductive manner over to the entrance of the makeup area where you are encountered by a large man guarding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jerry I assume?&quot; You speak with a sweat yet confident voice, unlike anything you&#39;ve ever said in the past... er future. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, and you&#39;re  the singer the doorman just brought in. Suppose you&#39;re here to get ready. Room 4 is free. Just head down the hall you won&#39;t miss it.&quot; <br />
<br />
You give a friendly  smile in response &quot;Thank you mister.&quot; You are about to head in, escaping this whole mess with Jimmy but something inside you stops you, looking back at Jerry you suddenly blurt out &quot;By the way, you know Jimmy McCoy?&quot; in response, both you and Jerry discreetly glance at the man in question before back at each other in which Jerry goes &quot;I do indeed. He bothering you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile but shake your head &quot;That&#39;s sweat of you to be concerned but me and Jimmy have been getting along swell. In fact you would be so kind as to send him my way if he comes looking I would be quite glad.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jerry raises his eyebrow at the request &quot;You really wanna get busy with that lousy mac?&quot; <br />
<br />
You simply give a dreamy smile &quot;Oh don&#39;t be so gruff. I think he&#39;s a cute fella.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jerry merely gives a shrug &quot;Well whatever floats your boat. Ain&#39;t none of my business. I&#39;ll send him your way, just don&#39;t cause a ruckus or nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
You give a cheeky grin &quot;No promises&quot; to which he simply rolls his eyes and mutters something about singers which you can barely make out as you begin walking down the hall and to Room 4.<br />
<br />
Entering you find a small room with plenty of clothes and make up lying around. A large vanity table in the corner and a sofa in the other. You take a seat on the sofa and swoon &quot;Oh I can&#39;t wait to get to know that fella all personal like...&quot; you say with a longing smile. Before blinking and realising you&#39;re alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.. what am I saying.&quot; You hold your head and shale it to clear it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting way to into this act...&quot; you comment as your mind once again drifts to how cute Jimmy looked... and how gorgeous he&#39;ll looking without it, causing you to shake your head once again. You wonder if you should ask the doctor about this, however you quickly dismiss it out of embarrassment over your actions. <br />
<br />
Maybe you should just leave. Sneak out and get data or whatever somewhere else. Getting up you almost make it to the door before catching a glance of your reflection in the mirror. Blinking, you can&#39;t help but appreciate your beauty, which you haven&#39;t had a chance to see first hand yet.<br />
<br />
As if you were in a trance, you walk over to the vanity able and take a seat before it. Slowly your entranced face turns into a smile, a smile shared by the beautiful face in the mirror &quot;Oh Anna Graven you look simply fabulous&quot; you remark playfully to yourself before realising you&#39;re using the fake name you gave to Jimmy. At least you think it&#39;s fake... your mind&#39;s getting kind of dizzy again.<br />
<br />
As you try to regain composure in your mind you suddenly notice the makeup. You instinctually pick it up and begin applying it with skill and experience &quot;I better put on a little something for my show... and for Jimmy&quot; you say with another smile and giggle, this time you are barely about to be shocked at your words due to the dizziness in your head.</p>
