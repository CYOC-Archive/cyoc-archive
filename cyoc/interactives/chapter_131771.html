<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, let&#39;s just sleep on it tonight and take it out with us in the morning&quot; Missy said &quot;there&#39;s another part we can add onto this to have more fun while giving us a little more control&quot;. As the other two watched on, Missy got up off the couch and moved to the bag; after fumbling around with it for a while she produced a new part which she proceeded to click into the bottom of the remote. &quot;what does this new part do?&quot; Skye asked shifting across the couch to get a better look. &quot;This new part blocks that full take over effect when you get absorbed into something, so you are supposed to still have your own mind in tact, and from what i hear sometimes a small bit of physical control&quot;.<br />
&quot;wait doesnt that defeat the purpose of being absorbed?&quot; Skye asked. &quot;i&#39;ll show you, it gives you a greater sense of experience without losing yourself.&quot; and with that Missy shot Skye in the head and then with a flourish pressed the red button while aiming at Scarlette. Scarlette only had time to say &quot;figures...&quot; before the light faded.<br />
<br />
Scarlette jumped off the couch as soon as her vision returned, patting herself down as she made for to mirror. Just before reaching it she turned to Missy, who had Skye in her arms; or more so, Skye&#39;s body with out a head, which she was lowering to the floor gently.<br />
Scarlette watched in amazement as Skye&#39;s body seemed to still breath even without a head; her chest rising and falling as if nothing had changed. &quot;Now dont you take advantage of me while im out&quot; came an unfamiliar voice. Scarlette in shock span around to find the source of the voice which seemed to be right next to her, only to face the mirror and see what was happening all along: Her head looked different, a combination of Scarlettes red hair which seemed to end in Skyes platinum blonde hair, even including the transition from curls to straight tips. Her eyes had changed too going from piercing green on one side to a light blue on the other...Scarlette could also feel emotions that didnt seem to fit her current state of mind, as well as thoughts and memories which werent hers.<br />
&quot;Yeah Scar, you got it, my head just became absorbed into yours&quot;. Scarlette watched as her mouth was that which moved, her voice an amalgamation of her own and Skyes own. &quot;I can talk throught the mouth but thats all i seem to be able to do, you&#39;re the one in control here, but it feels so wewird being just a part of you&quot;. Scarlette touched her face a few  times, running fingers over her lips and cheeks before turning to Missy. Scarlette was feeling this strange feeling, like a being turned on but not herself doing it. &quot;mmmmmm i can feel your feelings Skye&quot; Scarlette hummed &quot;calm down ok hun?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Missy turned to the Scarlette, who seemed to be struggling to keep from relieving her current horniness and pointed the remote &quot;times up&quot; and pressed the blue button. Scarlette wobbled abit as her vision faded and returned quite quick, Skyes reversion on the other hand was a bit slower, her head slowly forming like a balloon being inflated.<br />
Skye got to her feet, staggering as her control returned &quot;Ok new rule: Missy isnt allowed to touch the remote&quot;. &quot;aww but i make it so much fun&quot; Missy giggled.<br />
&quot;well im done for the night, being part of someone like that makes me want to spend time in my own body&quot;. Skye said, walking to her bedroom. &quot;you guys can stay if you want, take the couches or my bed has plenty of room too&quot;. She said with a sly grin before climbing into her blankets.<br />
<br />
Scarlettes sleep was filled with strange images and sounds, the whole thing left her uncomfortable. She woke with a start and made her way to the kitchen, this was a morning only coffee could fix. Missy and Skye were already awake and were getting breakfast ready. &quot;The bacon is almost ready can you please make us some toast Scar?&quot; Skye said with a grin, Scarlette felt she was upto something but it was too early to care. Scarlette grabbed a couple of slices out of the bread bin and sat up on the kitchen counter, it was easier to toast sitting down than standing up.<br />
Missy walked over and started to giggle as Skye continued to slyly grin; Scarlette didnt see what was so funny, as she inserted the toast into the two slots in her crotch her curiosity got the better of her. &quot;what is so funny?&quot; She said as she pushed down on her clit to start toasting. Scarlette shifted a bit on the counter, the warmth from toasting was always making her legs sweat a little.<br />
No longer able to contain herself any longer, Skye burst out laughing, nearly dropping the bacon she was putting onto a plate. &quot;So you havent noticed yet?&quot; Missy giggled. Scarlette suddenly remembered the remote, those two must have done something to her. She will have to check as soon as she was done toasting. &quot;Scar, doesnt it seem odd that you toast bread with your pussy?&quot;. Scarlette thought about that for a second &quot;Not really... i always have had a toaster there...&quot; Missy started laughing &quot;No girl, we used the remote on you to do that while you slept&quot;. The sudden shock and realisation hit Scarlette, in her surprise the toast shot out of her toaster pussy and slid across the table, this had Missy howling with laughter.<br />
&quot;why dont i feel like this is unnatural?&quot; Scarlette asked, lightly touching the outside edge of the toasting slots. &quot;We did it to you in your sleep, if you arent aware of the remote, you and the rest of the world will think the changes are totally natural&quot;. &quot;Well fix it!&quot; Scarlette snapped, it didnt feel good to be messed with like that.<br />
With a touch of a blue button, Scarlettes pussy slots merged back together and reformed into a simple vagina, the toaster reappearing into existance on the counter behind her.<br />
&quot;if its any consolation, you make good toast&quot; Missy said as she took a bit into her toast. Scarlette blushed a little, she felt both embarrassed and complimented; she still remembered thinking it was a normal thing so she felt a little pride in her toasting skills.<br />
<br />
After an award breakfast the three girls got dressed, all in Skyes clothing since the other left their clothes at home when they went out to the asylum. &quot;we can just get some more clothes while we are out today&quot;. Missy beamed as they headed out into the street, remote still clutched in her hand. And they headed to....</p>
