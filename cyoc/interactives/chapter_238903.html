<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of all the things, the crayons stood out the most. It was no different from the other baby supplies, yet it was singled out as it&#39;s own thing. Knowing this was all magic, clearly there there was more than meets the eyes. She reached in and grabbed the pack, opening it up to find a thin pack of 8 crayons: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, pink, black, and white. She raised an eyebrow at the strange collection: weren&#39;t there usually more? And where was orange or brown? She checked the note on the crayon box:<br />
<br />
As a child would use art to exhibit their creative will, so too will you use these to exert your imagination onto reality. Use them wisely. Or better yet, don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Rachel narrowed her eyes as she stifled a burp, only feeling more confused. She slid the crayons out of the box into her hand, and felt a jolt to run through her body, causing her hair to stand on end and a popping *Frt* *frt* *frrt* to stink up the room further. She might have only known about magic for literally less than 5 minutes, but already she could tell these crayons were immensely powerful. It kind of scared her, kind of excited her. She wondered how to use them, but for some reason she felt she didn&#39;t need instructions. She pulls out the purple crayon, reminding her of a child&#39;s book she liked when she was younger under a similar name. Taking inspiration, she holds up the crayon into the air as if it were her canvas, and started drawing. Like magic, purple trails were left in the air. Rachel giggled, truly feeling like a child again with how whimsical it felt. A down side she quickly noticed, however, was her drawing skills seemed to have entirely regressed. She was no artist by any means, but Rachel was capable of at least straight lines and basic detail. Now, however, she can barely manage a stick figure, her drawing looking little better than an actual toddler&#39;s scribbles. She gave up in frustration, wiping her hand across the air. Like magic, the purple lines also disappeared. She tried again, this time with a clear idea in her head: just a simple chair. She had far more success this time, able to etch out an incredibly simplistic one person couch. When she finished, she looked at her work with a heightened sense of pride, almost wanting to grab her mom to show her how good a job she did. The thought made her flush in embarrassment, not wanting to admit how appealing the idea was; as more time passed, the more she realized being a &#39;big baby&#39; was more than just a name. She frowned as she realized the dimensions were...off. As she shifted her perspective, the image didn&#39;t move the right way. If anything, it looked like it was no longer a 2D image. As she walked forward, she realized she was right: right there in front of her was now a solid chair, not too dissimilar to the crayon-like look of the other big baby objects. She touched it and even sat on it, christening it with a wet *vrrrt*.<br />
&quot;Oh, this is wild.&quot; She said to herself. She felt butterflies in her stomach from the excitement, even when it caused another nasty cramp in her gut leading to another chain of toots. Now that she got a taste of it&#39;s power, she wanted to see the full extent of their abilities. However, she felt like she needed to use them on another person. Looking out the window, she just so happened to spot a young woman going for a jog down the street. A new, incredibly impatient part of Rachel&#39;s brain told her to use them on that girl in particular. Without thinking, she drew a line right in front of the woman and watched as she slammed into it like a wall. Though a little unnerved at her own impulsivity, she drew a few other lines and connected them like a little rectangle, effectively making a cage. The woman, now confused, tried to move, but found herself confined in the little purple cage. She probably can&#39;t even see it, if Rachel&#39;s understanding the &#39;invisible world&#39; part correctly. <br />
While the woman was trapped, she was still clearly visible. Rachel&#39;s eyes trained on the white crayon, and upon picking it up Rachel intuitively drew a little circle with a line crossing through it over the woman. It dispersed like a mist. The woman was starting to panic as she tried and failed to escape, and though Rachel couldn&#39;t hear her through the window, it was obvious she was yelling. However, it seemed like no one was paying attention. Another person even walked right past her, and even though the woman shouted at him, he didn&#39;t give her so much as a glance. For all intents and purposes, the woman was now a ghost. That gave Rachel a little more time to mess around with the other crayons. She knew now that purple makes solid objects, and white affects perception. She picked the green one up next, and smiled. She got a mischievous energy from it. She grunted as another loud *Frrrbt* exited her, infecting the air with a stale stench she doesn&#39;t think is ever going away. It gives her an idea. She draws a little fart cloud behind the lady, and watches as it disperses at the same time the woman straightens with blush. Rachel can&#39;t hear what&#39;s happening, but she&#39;s sure the woman just farted. She draws a few little clouds behind her, and watches as the woman grabs her stomach in pain. Suddenly, little crayon fart clouds puff out of her behind like she&#39;s a cartoon, her face turning more red with each release. Green, it seems, curses people, and Rachel has passed her little curse onto someone else. Wondering how MUCH like herself she could make this woman, she draws three little stink lines above her behind. They animate at the same time as the back of her shorts bulge with a big poopy. The woman is on the verge of tears as she grabs her behind in shock, still incapable of stopping her constant toots.<br />
Feeling a little bad, she next grabbed the pink crayon. This had the most &#39;baby&#39; energy to it, and Rachel had a feeling she knew what it did even without touching it. She drew a circle on the woman&#39;s shorts and was unsurprised when the pants inflated further with a very bulky diaper. Now, at least, she was properly equipped <br />
She wanted to change the rest of her clothes, but stopped as she picked up the yellow crayon---something told her to use that one first. She marveled as she held the crayon out, and it&#39;s color suddenly matched the woman&#39;s skin color; if she had a guess, this could change a person&#39;s body. She wasted no time in drawing a large circle over her stomach, and marveled as the woman&#39;s belly inflated to fill it, her thin stomach blobbing out into a two folded, barrel sized belly that poured over her new diaper. At the same time, she traced her clothes with the pink crayon, and continued until the entire woman was colored. Her legs expanded into tree-trunks, filling in her thigh gap even as the diaper bulked along with her. Her butt filled her diaper further, going from toned to jiggling beach balls. Her arms ripped through her shirt as she grew flabby bingo wings. All the while, her clothes shifted into a large pink onesie that stretched over her now massive stomach. As a final touch, Rachel drew a little pink dot on her mouth that transformed into a pacifier while her cheeks inflated and she grew a double chin. By the end, the jogger from before was no longer, now a 400 lb. adult baby who couldn&#39;t stop farting into her massive, loaded diaper. <br />
She was much closer to tears, involuntarily sucking her pacifier in comfort as her legs struggled to hold up their sudden drastic increase in weight. Rachel chuckled to herself, deciding to help her along. She grabbed the blue crayon and felt her thoughts get louder, actively asking why she&#39;s doing this to a stranger without remorse before another voice answers it&#39;s just a little fun. She takes the hint and draws a little though bubble above the woman, drawing a stick figure crawling inside. The woman collapsed to her hands and knees as the ability to walk vanished from her mind. If blue affected thoughts, then Rachel figured red must affect feelings. The woman had stayed strong for the most part, not crying even in the face of her body shifting, changing, and betraying her. Rachel drew a tiny red tear on her, and the dam burst. The woman fell onto her messy behind, and began to wail so loudly Rachel could hear her from the streets, looking no different from a baby.<br />
Rachel let out a sigh of satisfaction as she looked at her work, a jogger turned into a fat, gassy baby wailing on her stinky diaper. She now had a moment to really observe her actions, and wonder how she suddenly became so okay with what she would consider horrifying before. Did being a &#39;big baby&#39; make her less empathetic or something? Regardless, she had a feeling that the changes were as easy to undo as wiping her hand across the woman. She pauses briefly right before she does, however. Is she really done with the woman?</p>
