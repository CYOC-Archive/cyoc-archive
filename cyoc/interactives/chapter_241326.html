<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“R-rob?” Lucy mewed out in her faint, mousy voice, trying to catch her crush’s attention.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Hey, Lucy. What are you doing here today?” Rob finally noticed Lucy as he passed through the stable hand-in-hand with Victora. Lucy was an was an easy girl to miss. “If you’re here for horse riding, the farm’s not doing those today. Just here lookin’ to help out? Could use the help.”<br />
<br />
“Y-ye.” Lucy blushed, averting her gaze from her high-school crush, blushing as she idly whipped a push broom through an empty stall, sequestering used bedding to one side of the stall to be scooped up. “-a-and… well… I did want to ask you. You see, the Homecoming dance is going on in two weeks or so… so I was wondering if…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, the dance!” Victoria smirked deviously at Lucy before turning towards Rob, squeezing his hand tight. “Funny you should mention. I just asked Rob yesterday and who’d’ve guessed nobody got hooked up with this good-looking guy yet!”<br />
<br />
Lucy looked mortified as she turned towards Rob, her face asking if it were true. The muscular farm-boy grinned and scratched the back of his head, ruffling his dirty blonde hair.<br />
<br />
“Heh, I guess I’ve have so much work to do around her lately and it just slipped my mind. Frankly, I didn’t think I’d find a girl that would even wanna go out with me.”<br />
<br />
Victoria threw an arm around Rob’s neck before kissing him on the cheek. The boy staggered a step back, unprepared for the kiss but not at all put off by it.<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t sell yourself short, I for one know there’s a few girls out there who’d been dying to get to know you. Unfortunately for them, finders keepers.” She glances back over to Lucy with a cheeky smile. “Feels like you haven’t kissed much before though, Rob. Come with me. Let’s practice.”<br />
<br />
Lucy found that she couldn’t move as the pair sauntered out the barn arm-in-arm, she couldn’t speak either. This is what getting hit by a car felt like. This is what it was like getting shot and having a bullet sever your spine. It took half a minute before the shock passed, then came the deep, crippling hurt.<br />
<br />
“Victoria? I… trusted you…” She squeaked out as the new couple headed out far from view, a tear beginning to strew down her face as sadness and despair billowed inside the recesses or her mind. But there was one more emotion there. Something the soft, shy girl hardly ever felt.<br />
<br />
Hatred. Rage. It was alien to her. At first it was just a little seed, but it grew rapidly inside Lucy. Her body heating up just looking at the two from the stall’s window as they stopped along the periphery of Rob’s parent’s horse farm. For the first time ever, he truly, really hated someone.<br />
<br />
“Victoria…”<br />
<br />
Lucy winced as she said the name as if it were a curse word, her teeth gritting as she began to scrape her fingers against the sill of the window in the horse stall, digging her nails into the wood.<br />
<br />
Victora knew. They were friends since elementary school and Lucy told her everything. She knew Lucy had had a deep crush on Rob since their Freshman year and the reason she’d been volunteering at the horse farm was just to see Rob, trying to build up the courage to ask him out. Victoria was experienced with boys so Lucy naturally asked her for advice on how to do so, but never did she think Victoria would steal him away. Never did she think she’d betray her like this.<br />
<br />
It hurt. It was evil. Why did she do this!?<br />
<br />
Spite welled in behind the girl’s glasses, her eyes practically growing with rage as she watched Victoria prop herself up to Rob’s height on the split-rail fence, hugging him… kissing him. It should have been her. Victoria had already had her share of boyfriends throughout high school. Her wild raven-black hair and slutty outfits meant she had a steady stream of boys always wanting to go out with her, so why did she have to steal Rob too?<br />
<br />
Lucy seethed. She never felt hatred well up inside her like this, sweat sopping over her soft skin as she felt like she was boiling up inside. If she could in this very moment, she’d kill Victoria. She’d claw her eyes out and bite her head off for what she did to her!<br />
<br />
She winced as she suddenly felt a pin nip her in the butt, the pain similar to a flu shot’s for just a moment until it suddenly passed. Lucy peered behind her, finding nothing out of the ordinary – neither horse or any other animal that could have bit her. It must have been a horse fly. Lucy rubbed her butt a few times more until she turned back towards Victoria with distain, spotting her making out with Rob again, and this time it was way more than a kiss!<br />
<br />
Steam practically shot from Lucy’s nostrils as she huffed, Victoria giving him tongue just to add insult to injury! The girl butt her crotch against the horse stall’s wall, a foreign tingle augmenting that disdain for Victoria, bizarrely eliciting satisfaction… fulfillment even.<br />
<br />
Lucy was horny. The anger was making her horny. Lucy, ever the demure girl simply never indulged in anger, but now that she let go for the first time, it was like a damn bursting.<br />
<br />
She eye-ball fucked Rob as she cast death rays at Victoria, the girl unzipping her tight-fitting jeans as she plunged her hand into her panties. Huffing and gasping and steaming, she toyed with her delicate nether lips, gooey honey oozing from her girlhood as she sawed her index finger against her hot-pink button. Girl cum ran down her legs as she plunged her fingers in deeper and deeper, twisted lust urging her on, hardly noticing as her insides started to get spread out by… something.<br />
<br />
That “something” hardly mattered to her at first. Yeah, she felt it, but it felt amazing! It was hot and rubbery and sensitive, her toes curling in her muck boots as the intruder filled out the insides of her birth canal, wet gushes of lube queefing out of her pussy as that thing took up more and more space until suddenly, it burst out with a loud “pop”!<br />
<br />
That got Lucy’s attention. Her legs shivered like they’d turned to spaghetti noodles; she had to prop herself on the stable’s wall just to keep from falling over. The feeling of some sort of protrusion poking out between her thighs zeroed out her motor functions, just the feel of her lush skin rubbing against it shot so much pleasure into her brain, it was hard to fathom it!<br />
<br />
She widened her stance just enough to halt that crippling pleasure, her hands shaking as she reached them down… to prod…<br />
<br />
“A p-penis…”<br />
<br />
Lucy’s fingers felt it. She fearfully looked down to confirm it. Her puffy labial lips had sprouted a three-inch long member. That ruby-red bulb of her clit had seemingly affixed itself to the tip, making it look like a thrumming glans, blood pumping into it to force her length to stand up erect… and to get bigger.<br />
<br />
She had to call a doctor! She had to get help from anyone, her shaky voice quietly crackling out to the boy that should have been her lover for help, his very name causing a spike of mind-numbing dopamine to blast up her spine right into her brain. It was irresistible. She had to indulge it.<br />
<br />
She grabbed hold of it. She had to. It felt like it was taking over her mind like some sort of parasite. She tried pushing it back inside her to put things back the way they were, but as soon as that proved itself fruitless, she tugged it and yanked it and stroked it, the girl throwing her head back and gasping, realizing that just made things so much worse! Or… maybe better.<br />
<br />
She’d just learned to masturbate, palm clutching the plump shaft of her six-inch penis, pumping her fist from the base of her crotch to the underside of her sensitive cock tip. She bit her lip, drool spilling out onto her chin, staining her shirt as she stared down at her growing penis with disdain and affection, harshly squeezing it as tiny dripples of slick pre-cum drooled out her tip, slathering it all over her shaft and making it all the easy to jerk off.<br />
<br />
As she moaned and masturbated her new piece of male anatomy, a fleshy ring cut off that smooth path between cock tip to base. It didn’t matter. That medial ring made it all the better, pre-cum spurting out her dilated piss-hole like a squirt gun as her cock flesh grew thicker and rubbery and… mottled?<br />
<br />
If growing a cock wasn’t weird enough, it began to speckle with brownish spots, its shape growing even thicker like a long silicone tube, the prehensile flesh wagging in the air as her body fought to pump even more of her limited human blood to fuel that bestial, budding erection.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t afraid of it anymore. Fear was the last thing on her mind as her reeling brain got spiked with male bliss. Choking her member with both hands, she indulged it, clenching her eyes shut as she felt it grow longer and girthier, so fat that a single hand couldn’t hug the circumference of the thing!<br />
<br />
“MMmpphhf… f-fuck…” She wheezed, her lungs hardly able to fuel oxygen to her maleness. “Fuck Rob… fuck Victoria. I want more… more…!”<br />
<br />
The mousey timidity that had held back her voice grew into commanding brays. Just thinking about those two hugging and kissing and fucking warped her mind with a maelstrom of lust, all her pent-up emotions welling up inside her penis as it surpassed a foot in length, the girl letting out a steamy cry of lust-soaked pain as she birthed something out!<br />
<br />
Her vagina was already spread open with that cock growing out from inside, but two soft-ball sized lumps made it unbearable. Agonized, growling gasps punctuated her moans, the girl still stroking off as her labia stretched, a fleshy membrane furrowing outwards, catching the two orbs, sealing off her feminine opening.<br />
<br />
Lucy unconsciously shifted her stance sider as her new testicles pressed between her thighs, that taut pink scrotum anything but human, and unbeknownst to Lucy, the same could be said for her very soon as well.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the finer details of the shape of her body, her mind was attuned to attending to her raging hardon. It was never something she’d never felt the need to think about. How often does your body just flat out change like that?<br />
<br />
How would she even know the feel of it? How could she sense the slithering sensation rolling up her legs spelled out a burgeoning mass of horsepower seeping into her thighs. Puffy bouts of budding fat encompassed her thighs, almost strangling her balls had it not been for that outlandish feeling of her skeleton reossifiying. Hips dissolvedg and calcified again in a matter of seconds, giving her a naturally wide stance and the scaffolding for the rest of her changes to latch onto.<br />
<br />
Her jeans burst along their seams, jiggly horse fat and muscle exposed to the sex-soaked air as she began to grow taller than even Rob was! Her curling toes scrunched straight out of her boots as a mass of keratin burst out in their place.<br />
<br />
Hooves. Two dish-pan sized rounds of ebony black hooves awkwardly clopped on the ground. The unaware girl remained propped up with her back to the wall as her leg’s bones and ligaments realigned, folding at some points and extending in others.<br />
<br />
To Lucy it must have just seemed like there was a horse clopping around their stall on the other side of the stable making all that noise. The concept of having hooves was too foreign to even enter her mind. Yet with her eyes screwed shut and her brain doped up on that wellspring of pleasure surging from her dick, the sensation of hooves cemented itself in her mind as neurons connected themselves to that sexual bliss. Every clop made her horny, every twitch of her muscles underneath the speckled hide growing up along her legs shot ecstasy through her nerves.<br />
<br />
Her flaring nostrils drank in the humid smell of horse hanging around the stable, the stench of manure and stallion and sex alone almost making her cum by itself, but she managed to hold it off, not willing to give up the moment just yet.<br />
<br />
She still didn’t know what was happening to her, yet she didn’t want to change a thing about the moment. She didn’t want to think about it. If she did, she might get worried that she wasn’t a girl anymore, worried about her big her new cock was getting. It was best to let it be.<br />
<br />
A grunt rippled through her throat as her spine jut out from both hands, stretching her mid-section high as a long fleshy bulb of tail fitfully sprout inch by inch from the tip of her butt. Her rear mashed against the wall behind her, lifting her back away from the wood so only her shoulders were left to help prop her up.<br />
<br />
She didn’t mind it at all. The sensation of the thick Appaloosa hide decking her butt as it got spread against the wood was anything but unwelcome. Her tail flagged up on its own accord, her butt cheeks fattening as they shifted into flanks as equine might swallowed up her modest human figure.<br />
<br />
Lucy sensed something like latex gum spurting from her anus, the girl butting her rear back even more as a puffy donut inflated right underneath her tail. The swollen anal flesh harmonized with the feeling of her masturbation. Even weirder yet, some sort of balloon-like thing inside her felt ticklish all-of-a-sudden, the bulb of nascent prostrate bloating inside her rectum as her ecstasy shifted to unbearable new heights.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t hold it in any longer! She jammed her hands tights around her cock, forcing that meaty head of horse pride to flair out to an unreasonable size as her penis jut out to two feet in length. Precum spewed out the tip of her sweaty dick as she stood on the precipice of orgasm! She ran her hands along it, tugging and tugging and tugging and then…<br />
<br />
Her hand slipped off. Lucy tried to grab it again, but that meaty shaft of mottled flesh just got nudged against two rock hard stones. Hooves.<br />
<br />
Lucy’s eyes shot open as the violent realization took hold. When did this happen?! Why didn’t she feel this!? She felt queasy, so dizzy she wasn’t thinking straight. She tried to lift her hands up and grasp her fingers together, only for a loud “clop” to confirm her eyes weren’t deceiving her. The bristles of a proto-mane stood up on the back of her neck as she finally grasped the situation for what it was.<br />
<br />
They were hooves. Real, heavy, unwieldy hooves that a horse would have! Her dainty hands were gone, trapped inside those hooves! She wouldn’t be able to do the things she loved – to drive, paint or write anymore! The one defining feature that separated humans from the lesser animals was gone. Hooves. Hooves like a horse’s.<br />
<br />
“Ummmfff… AARAHH!” Lucy cried out a burp like she was about to throw up, her stomach suddenly flaring to the size of a beach ball, delicate skin stretching around the obscene growth of horse fat billowing from her belly.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t just her stomach that had lost its feminine features. It was everything! It happened when her eyes were closed! Her entire bottom half had surrendered to those asinine feral features while she wasn’t looking!<br />
<br />
She was really about to throw up now! She was scared and horrified and horny… so horny.<br />
<br />
Horny. Sex… sex.<br />
<br />
She’d never had sex before, but for some reason every awkward clop from her hooves, every flick of her tail and fitful bout of growth from her belly just felt like pure, unfiltered sex shooting straight up to her frontal cortex. Her battering ram of a cock kept spewing out clear shots of slimy precum, bobbing every time she clopped, every time she almost caught herself neighing. It felt so good it hurt, her mind reeling as she realized half her humanity had dissolved due to pleasuring this… this thing!<br />
<br />
It arched higher with each whip of her tail, her body betraying her as she tried to hold up her hooves to force it back, but her arms seemed… stiff. Fear electrocuted the worry-centers of her brain for just a moment, just before her mind had something bigger to contend with!<br />
<br />
“ROB! ROB HELP ME! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP MEEIIGHGH!”<br />
<br />
“PLLALAP!”<br />
<br />
A gush of precum exploded against her shirt, that stubborn rod of horse meat banging in between the pillowy soft confines of her breasts as that flared tip nudged just under her chin. Her erection false-retreated downwards for a few moments before slapping up with double the force right up against her belly! Lucy’s nipples grew erect at the burning-hot sensation of boy meat battering away at her mammaries. A cupful of precum splashed just inches away from her mouth, that equine glans flaring to the size of a melon as it filled the horse stall with the dizzying miasma of feral sex.<br />
<br />
“HeeehHEEeHhE MEEHHEeegheeeEhhEE”<br />
<br />
Lucy’s words were subsumed by neighs, the girl losing both the mental and physical capacity to speak as the human organs in her chest bolstered into engines strong enough to fuel her new body. Her sweat-soaked shirt clung tight against her barreling-out abdomen as her neck grew outwards, stretching her vocal cords beyond the point of speech. As her head began to bulge out, nose and maw shifting forwards as her skull crunched and thickened into a horses, she started to lose her sense of direction, the word spinning around her!<br />
<br />
Up might as well been down, leaning against the side of the barn might as well have been toppling over as her heavy body quickly lost the battle to stay upright. The changing girl topped out at 13-feet tall from hoof to ear before jutting forward, wobbling on two hooves as she fought to preserve her bipedalism.<br />
<br />
Despite her human mind growing corrupt with the thoughts and instincts of an animal, she viscerally felt in her subconscious that if she fell on four hooves that was it! Standing on two legs filibustered the last violent changes to her spinal cord, the core of her body still made to support a human torso, and it showed.<br />
<br />
Her breasts still clung to her chest despite getting covered in white and brown Appaloosa fur and her belly had yet to jut out like a horse’s but trying to hold onto her humanity at all was a losing matter.<br />
<br />
“Clop!”<br />
<br />
All four hooves sounded in unison. Her hips snapped as her belly pushed out into a hefty horse ponch. Her breasts disappeared under the cage of her barrel as the former-girl hopped awkwardly on her new legs, trying to get back up and regain her humanity. But it was useless!<br />
<br />
Her spine had snapped to leaving her permanently a quadruped, the sensation of walking on all fours as natural as breathing was to her now! She squealed and neighed, cursing her fate as pleasure from her cock leaked into the interstitial recesses of her brain, numbing the latent humanity buried deep within.<br />
<br />
Her frustrated neighs deepened to squealing whinnies. Her hips thrust on their own accord, cock slapping against her belly as her balls flexed! She was so close! She didn’t know if she wanted to cum or didn’t anymore! She didn’t know why she cared! The one-ton mass of Appaloosa stallion that used to be the small, shy Lucy obnoxiously spewed a geyser-load of steaming hot pre from her cock, the confused girl eclipsed by the stallion she had become as her balls clenched, her first orgasm as a horse closer… closer… closer…<br />
<br />
“…”<br />
<br />
Out of the periphery of her wide equine eyes, she caught a view of the entrance of the stall, a human staring at her. It was Rob. He heard her crying for help! He came! But… was it too late?<br />
<br />
Lucy’s stance grew submissive at the sight of him, the huge stallion growing as anxious around him as the human Lucy had always been. It wasn’t like it was before though. The girl’s long horse face shifted to sheer terror as she realized her over two-foot-long horse cock was swaying underneath her belly, still dripping cum.<br />
<br />
But he was just standing there. Did he recognize her? Half of her wished he did. The other half prayed he didn’t.<br />
<br />
He took a step forward, his strong hand petting her along her flank before he finally spoke.<br />
<br />
“Mom just got back from the horse auction, huh?” He sighed like this was some regular occurrence. “Figures she’d just toss you in a stall.”<br />
<br />
He was talking to himself, not for her sake. He didn’t know it was her. She didn’t know whether to be terrified about not being recognized as human, or happy that she had an excuse for her shame hanging between her legs.<br />
<br />
It was happy. She felt like she did when she’d seen Rob pass along her in the halls at school, but this time, he noticed her. He never noticed her.<br />
<br />
With Rob around her, she wouldn’t dare masturbate. It was a good thing too. She was so close to having an orgasm. She felt herself practically slipping away back there.<br />
<br />
“Hold still. I bet my stupid Mom let you nudge up around the mares on your way here.”  He remarked, looking down at her erection. “Figures. We’re supposed to keep the mares at a separate barn on the other side of the barn to not fuck with the stallions. Guess that’s why you’ve been neighing bloody murder. I guess you could use some help.”<br />
<br />
Lucy’s ears perked up as she heard the word “help”, her head arching to the side as she whickered like she was trying to ask what he meant by that. She lost sight of him as he ducked underneath her huge belly, and then, a warm hand clutched around her shaft.<br />
<br />
She gasped, a punctuation point of a neigh erupting from her throat as Rob clutched her stallionhood and began stroking it!<br />
<br />
“Don’t… touch that! Please! Rob, it’s me! I’m not a horse! Stop treating me like a horse!”<br />
<br />
Lucy tried to speak clearly, but none of it came out right! Her attempts at speaking trailed off into mindless whinnying as her head felt heavy with the sheer weight of stallion bliss she was trying to avoid! The thing she was trying so hard to escape from was suddenly forced on her by the boy she loved!<br />
<br />
She already sensed her horse instincts shoving her human mind to the side as blood flowed to her cock, Rob fondling her bowling-ball sized stallion jewels as she began thrusting. This was bad but it felt so good! She was becoming a slave to Rob’s hands as her animal instincts made her rut, forcing out steaming splurts of cum overtime that penis plapped against her muscular belly!<br />
<br />
She had to escape, but she didn’t want to risk trampling him! Did he really think this was helping or was this some kind of sick kink of his!? Did he like doing this. Did he like… stallions?<br />
<br />
Rob tended to her cock like he was filling up a tank of gas in his truck, but it was anything but ordinary to Lucy. Worries swirled around her mind like they were circling a drain, ecstasy lighting up the negative space left by her human thoughts as all the questions faded into irrelevancy.<br />
<br />
Sex. Breeding. The thoughts seemed out of left field at first but then they made all the sense in the world. Her rippling muscles flexed, tail hiked up high in the air as every erogenous point in her body thrummed with heat. The air was wet with horse sweat, Lucy’s scent lingering in the air, each huff she took in serving little more purpose than to feed back into her lust and do away with all human inhibitions.<br />
<br />
Past and future dissolved until there was just the single point of the present. Her memories of her childhood as a girl and ambitions to become a librarian might as well not have existed.<br />
<br />
She was a horse.<br />
<br />
Lucy began to pant, equine eyes dilating.<br />
<br />
HE was a horse. He’d always been a horse.<br />
<br />
Something about that lit a fire inside him. The horse’s entire body clenched as he jackhammered his cock into the human’s hand like it was a broodmare. Those giant cum factories bloated up and tensed in between his thighs as he pushed forward hard, harder than he’d ever done, Rob’s hand’s hardly able to keep hold of Lucy’s powerful cock until the dam finally burst!<br />
<br />
A drooly neigh erupted from between the stallion’s blocky teeth as his dick spewed out snot-like bursts of seed all over the wooden floor below. A puddle formed, yet Lucy was not at all close to relieving those pent-up urges welling inside his balls.<br />
<br />
Not a thought furrowed his orgasm. Each and every neuron in his brain was attuned to his body, obsessed with the feel of his hooves and smell of his sex, obsessed with the sensation of cupfuls of semen spurting out his tip. He was obsessed with Rob feeling it all too, obsessed with Rob being impressed with him, of thinking he was a good horse!<br />
<br />
For two whole minutes he was in Nirvana, a high so high he might as well have died on gone to horse heaven if it wasn’t for his cock starting to grow flaccid, his cumshots getting smaller.<br />
<br />
Rob withdrew his hands, letting Lucy’s cock drop below him, dripping and swaying as Rob affixed a halter to his face and walked him out of the stall. His sex-addled mind following alongside Rob unquestioning outside as they walked along the path together, making their way towards the pasture.<br />
<br />
For a little while it seemed right. Like this is how it always was and how it always should be. But that human girl Lucy seeped into his mind again, and the horse recognized Rob as more than just his handler. <br />
<br />
“Rob? It’s me. It’s me, Lucy.”<br />
<br />
She tried to speak, only for the words to get garbled by a neigh.<br />
<br />
“Calm down, big guy.” Rob said, trying to calm the beast down. “You’re gonna get to go to the pasture while we clean the stalls. Lord knows they need to be cleaned after that.”<br />
<br />
“Ziiiep!”<br />
<br />
Lucy snorted as his ears registered some sort of arrow flying towards him only to feel a little pinch in his butt. It must have been another horse fly… but… maybe not.<br />
<br />
His penis started to feel heavy again, his heart pumping blood into it again as that flaccid dick regained it rigidity from before.<br />
<br />
Rob was cute. Rob smelled nice.<br />
<br />
Lucy didn’t know why but just looking over to Rob made his horse heart flutter like even stronger than it did the day he met him as a human.<br />
<br />
He had just masturbated him; did that mean something to him? Did he like stallions? Did he really really like stallions?<br />
<br />
Lucy dipped his head down, hooking his chin around his shoulder before tugging him back until Rob got pressed right up against the side of his muscular equine flank. The two froze in place, Rob’s cheek mashed against the soft fur of Lucy’s Appaloosa hide as he tried to yank himself away, only for Lucy to insist further.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be shy! You can touch me. I’m your horse!” Lucy’s nickers were unintelligible to Rob as his muzzle shoved the boy back towards his huge body, pushing him down just enough to sink him underneath his massive barrel of a belly.<br />
<br />
Back when Lucy was a girl, he’d always dreamed of the day he’d be able to strip in front of Rob and show off his body to him, but this was better. His body was so much nicer now – big strong and stallion, outclassing a feeble human’s. He whickered happily as he playfully nudged his hips forward, feeling his crush’s cheek press against the slimy side of his erection, feeling his leathery scrotum blanket the boy’s face, his balls enveloping his whole head if not just for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Oh, ride me!” Lucy nickered; the idea so obvious but so hot. “Ride me, get on my back and ride me! I’ve ridden horses a hundred times before, so I know how to be a good mount!”<br />
<br />
Lucy’s cock throbbed just thinking about it: their bodies rubbing up against one another, Rob getting to feel his strong stallion form underneath him, getting to treat him like a real horse.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s got into you!?” Rob stubbled away, grabbing Lucy’s halter hard as he yanked the unruly stallion towards the gate of the pasture. “Figures I’d have to deal with a stubborn horse like you right when I got to kiss a girl. Where is Victoria anyway?”<br />
<br />
The new “Victoria” made Lucy pin her ears back, the horse looking this way and that, catching no sight of the human girl anywhere near her. Off in the pasture though, there was a pile of clothes… and a horse making its way towards the gate. It was dapple-grey with a long, luxurious raven-black mane and tail. It was a stallion too, his cock hard and swaying underneath him, looking at Rob with lust at Lucy like he was competition.<br />
<br />
Victoria.<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________<br />
<br />
High up in a nearby apple tree, Cupid snickered at the drama he’d caused. The lovey-dovey stuff didn’t always suit him, so pitting two competitors against each other for the heart of one lover always made for great entertainment.<br />
<br />
The two girls were great friends until he shot a love-at-first-sight arrow at Victoria and made her just as hopelessly in love with Rob as Lucy had been, and shooting more arrows at them just added to the fun!<br />
<br />
The only question is now is, would it be a better show if they fought it out, or maybe he ought to fire a few more arrows, just to make things more interesting!</p>
