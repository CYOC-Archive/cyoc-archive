<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about....I pick something....and I keep it a secret from you. At least until the change has already been, I dunno, put into effect? Totally up to you, of course,&quot; Jade said. &quot;And you can totally lay down the ground rules here on what is and isn&#39;t allowed!&quot; she added hastily. &quot;I don&#39;t want - I don&#39;t want to pick anything that would be...y&#39;know...weird for you? Weirder than this already is, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at Jade and smile. She looks just about as nervous as you feel. You look down at the catalog, browsing through the various options. And then you look back up at Jade. She&#39;s your best friend, and has been for many years now. <br />
<br />
You trust her.<br />
<br />
And...a part of you is excited by the idea of having Jade pick something without you knowing what it is right away. <br />
<br />
&quot;....Okay,&quot; you tell her. You push the catalog towards her. &quot;No limits,&quot; you add in a smaller voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but...I don&#39;t want....I mean....there&#39;s gotta be some kind of...&quot;<br />
<br />
You lean in closer, looking at her in the eyes. &quot;No. Limits,&quot; you whisper to her. You sit back, and Jade doesn&#39;t break the eye contact for a few moments before blushing and looking down at the catalog. You&#39;ve never seen your friend this flustered before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jade said. &quot;Okay.&quot; She takes a minute to flip through the catalog, checking out the various options. &quot;I can promise you, it won&#39;t be a toilet. Gross,&quot; Jade muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. That&#39;s good to know,&quot; you admit. &quot;That option never even entered my mind, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s listed under popular choices, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
You giggle at the idea of it. You feel a bit flushed, and a tinge of anxiety goes through you - but it&#39;s the kind of anxiety that makes you feel alive. It&#39;s hard to think that you&#39;re really going to go through with this. <br />
<br />
Jade looks up at you again. &quot;...No limits?&quot; she asks again.<br />
<br />
You look at her steadily. &quot;No limits,&quot; you repeat with a slight smirk.<br />
<br />
Jade closes her eyes, and her smile grows. &quot;...Okay,&quot; she says. She closes the catalog and stands up. &quot;I&#39;ll be back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stay in the waiting area, looking around the corner briefly to see Jade walk over to Ashley. Ashley tilts her head forward, listening to whatever it is Jade is telling her - you&#39;re too far away to hear anything. Ashley&#39;s eyes flicker over to you, and she smiles, before nodding at Jade. Ashley follows Jade back over to you, and you stand up, feeling a fresh wave of nerves wash over you. It&#39;s not too late to back out of this. But...no. You&#39;re going to go through with it. Jade will be your &#39;owner&#39; for a weekend. You&#39;re kind of dying to know what she picked for you to become. <br />
<br />
Jade is blushing a bit when they enter the room, but Ashley still has that teasing smile on her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well,&quot; she said. &quot;A mystery option! How exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a nervous laugh. &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade blush deepens. Oh man. Now you really wanna know what she picked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so...follow me,&quot; Ashley said. <br />
<br />
You and Jade follow after Ashley, who saunters down the hallway. As Ashley leads you to one of the back rooms, Jade keeps glancing over at you, opening her mouth, and closing it again before she can say anything. You smirk at her, mouthing the question <i>what?</i> to her. But she just shakes her head with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Ashley leads you into a small room. It&#39;s feels a bit like a doctor&#39;s office, though perhaps not as clinical. There&#39;s a chair in the center of the room - like a cross between a dentist&#39;s chair and a more traditional la-z-boy chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this where...it happens?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Ashley says. &quot;It kind of depends on what the transformation is going to be. The size and type of object will factor into where the transformation takes place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jade asks. &quot;So like...what&#39;s the largest object someone has become?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...well...one guy opted to become a full on truck rig. That one, we had to rent a warehouse space in order to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh - damn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know that whatever I&#39;ll become is small enough to fit in a room,&quot; you say to Jade, who blushes again and looks away. &quot;Out of curiosity, people can become objects of any shape?&quot; Ashley nods. &quot;What...like...happens to a person&#39;s mass? Like...if they become small? Or where does the extra mass come from if you become larger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley laughed and spread her hands. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have to disappoint you, but I have no idea. I barely passed chemistry. The science behind it all is way beyond me.&quot; She walked over to the door. &quot;Alright, if you guys are settled in here, I&#39;m going to return to the front desk. The technician that will handle the actual transformation will be in momentarily. And I&#39;ll be sure to check in once you&#39;re finished,&quot; she adds with a final smirk.<br />
<br />
And with that, it&#39;s just you and Jade in the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Jade says, blushing again. &quot;Sorry...it&#39;s not...you can still back out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laugh. &quot;Jade! I&#39;m the one that called you here, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I told you - no limits!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few moments later, there&#39;s a knock at the door and then a woman in what looks to be her late twenties or perhaps early thirties comes in. She&#39;s wearing a lab coat, and her blonde hair is tied up into a ponytail. She gives you and Jade a friendly smile. &quot;Hi there, I&#39;m Dr. Denman. Which one of you is the transformee?&quot;<br />
<br />
You raise your hand. &quot;That&#39;d be me...&quot;<br />
<br />
She hands you a clipboard. &quot;First things first. We have to go over this with everyone who goes through the process for a first time. This will be a temporary transformation - upon your return, you&#39;ll be transformed back to normal. Payment is due upon your return, though we will need a card on file.&quot; Dr. Denman flips the page over. &quot;These are forms that essentially explain that you&#39;re agreeing to undergo the process. Many people have undergone this process - I believe you&#39;ve already seen a couple of said people yourself. It&#39;s a painless process - and quite the opposite depending on your choices. Which...I think will be up to your friend here, if I understand everything correctly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Me?&quot; Jade asks. &quot;I--uh...okay. I guess...I&#39;ll read that part...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Denman smirked. &quot;And finally, one last bit. I have to warn you about something called flashbacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flashbacks?&quot; you asked, frowning. Jade looks up as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It&#39;s an extremely rare occurrence - less than ten out of over a thousand transformed people have experienced this. However, we are legally required to warn you about the possibility. There is a chance that, upon reversal of the transformation, you may end up transforming back into the object you were. There is an even smaller chance, that, if that should happen, it could result in a permanent transformation. But,&quot; Dr. Denman adds in a stern voice, &quot;I must stress, the possibility is extremely small. You can, of course, opt not to go through the process. I&#39;m not trying to scare you or anything - it&#39;s just something we have to warn any new people about.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blink rapidly. &quot;Oh,&quot; you say in a small voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;People have been permanently stuck??&quot; Jade asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only three people - in thousands - ended up experiencing flashbacks that resulted in a permanent transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; Jade muttered. <br />
<br />
You look down at the various places to sign and chew on your lip. Three out of thousands...that&#39;s a pretty low number. And to back out now...it&#39;d always leave you wondering what it would have been like. <br />
<br />
You look at Jade, who seems a bit unsettled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; you tell her. &quot;It&#39;s fine. They gotta tell us that stuff. It&#39;s like the side effects list on commercials for medicine,&quot; you say. &quot;There&#39;s risk involved with anything, and I&#39;m tired of always playing it safe and predictable. I&#39;m doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Denman nods approvingly. &quot;Like I said - it&#39;s a very small chance, and it&#39;s a perfectly safe process regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade looks at you with an intent expression. &quot;You&#39;re sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; you say. &quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;ll be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, this makes her choke slightly and blush a bit deeper. You narrow your eyes a bit. Oh, you really wanna know what she picked now. <br />
<br />
You begin signing on the documents, until you get to the bit about the particulars of the transformation. <br />
<br />
Then you hand it over to Jade. She hesitates only for a moment before filling it out, and then hands it back to Dr. Denman.<br />
<br />
Dr. Denman looks over it, nods, and then gestures towards the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then! Megan, I&#39;m going to ask you to undress to your underwear, and then take a seat in this chair here. I&#39;ll get the device ready, and we can begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush at the thought. &quot;O-okay,&quot; you say. &quot;Um...take care of my stuff?&quot; you ask of Jade, who&#39;s blush has only deepened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh...yeah. Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you say. You set down your purse and phone, and then peel off your shirt, exposing your pink bra from Victoria&#39;s Secret. Jade&#39;s eyes widen, and then she turns away, letting out a small breath, leaving your smirking slightly. <br />
<br />
You kick off your pants and then awkwardly put yourself on the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then,&quot; Dr. Denman says. She&#39;s holding a small metal device - with a needle attachment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I hate needles,&quot; you grumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry - we have to inject the nanites for the process to work,&quot; Dr. Denman says. <br />
<br />
You nod, and hold out your hand to Jade. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; she asks in a low voice, smiling. &quot;You&#39;re about to be turned into an object, but you&#39;re scared of a needle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; you tell her, smirking. You close your eyes, and feel Dr. Denman place the object on your arm. There&#39;s a slight pinch, and you wince slightly. You can sort of feel something being injected into your arm. It feels...cold. And it begins to spread rapidly. There&#39;s a sort of tingling sensation as well. You shiver a little.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s that - you realize. The thing that will end up transforming you is already starting it&#39;s work.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s no backing out now. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s scary, to be sure. But also exciting. You look over at Jade, who&#39;s eyes have widened a bit as she looks at you. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;re you feeling?&quot; Dr. Denman asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. A little tingly,&quot; you admit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly normal,&quot; she assures you. &quot;The nanites spread rapidly and begin their work. You should start to feel the first effects in a moment.&quot; She begins to fiddle with the device, and turns to monitor her equipment.<br />
<br />
The tingling is getting a bit stronger, and you shift a little bit in the chair, letting out a nervous breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...no going back now,&quot; you tell Jade. &quot;What&#39;d you pick? I&#39;ve been dying...to...oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
You trail off. There&#39;s a warm sensation in your stomach...not a painful or uncomfortable one. Actually, quite the opposite. You shift a little bit more, and then gasp as a wave of warmth suddenly shoots through you. &quot;Oh!&quot; you gasp in surprise. You flush red as you realize you&#39;re starting to get turned on. Your panties feel wet. <br />
<br />
Jade rubs the back of her head, looking absolutely mortified all of a sudden. &quot;Yeah, um, I may, uh, I may have chosen...sensitivity...so it wouldn&#39;t...so it&#39;d feel...good...I guess...didn&#39;t want it to...y&#39;know...be...uncomfortable...&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a giggle, and then gasp again as the warmth returns, feeling more intense now. &quot;Ooooh,&quot; you gasp, shivering a bit. &quot;Wow. That&#39;s...wow. That&#39;s nice. Okay. No. That&#39;s cool. I think I can live with that,&quot; you say, giggling again. &quot;But seriously. What&#39;d you pick for me? What am I gonna be, oh temporary owner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade lets out a small squeak and covers her face with her hand, her blush deepening. &quot;Well...&quot;</p>
