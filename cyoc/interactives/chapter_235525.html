<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning arrived and the family woke up.  Mom and Dad kissed each other before getting out of bed to get ready for the day.  But as they got ready for the day, something popped into mom&#39;s mind.  &quot;Dear.&quot;, asked mom, &quot;Can you get the Chronivac out of your office for a minute before the kids leave their rooms?&quot;.  &quot;Yes, right away, actually.&quot;, replied dad in the middle of getting dressed.  Partially dressed in his work polo shirt and his boxer briefs, he went to his office and retrieved the Chronivac.  Once he returned to the room, he set it up on the night stand and booted it up.  He looked over to his wife and asked her, &quot;What do you want to change, hon?&quot;  &quot;Not much, dear.&quot;, replied his mom, Just make it so Jeff only recognizes his sister as a special needs kid in special education and nothing other than that after he arrives in his first grade class today.  Can you do that for me, dear?  I think it&#39;s for the best.  After that, you can turn the Chronivac off and return it to your vault in your room.&quot;  Dad only nodded and made the minor change that his wife wanted before shutting down the device.  He then quietly slipped out of the room to put the Chronivac back into the safe before locking it.  He and his wife then went about finishing getting ready for the day before going down to cook breakfast together.  Jeff and Katie were still completely clueless about what was going to happen to them today.  Jeff was looking forward to seeing his friend once he got to school, but dreaded having to talk to his first period teacher about his grades in that class.  They had a good relationship and they were working together to help Jeff improve his grades.  It was Jeff&#39;s idea that she give him extra algebra homework that didn&#39;t matter if it got finished or not so long as the regular stuff was done.  She was kind in giving him the correct answers on the homework assignments, but she still expected him to figure out how to get from &quot;point A to point B&quot;.  The teacher never graded her students on how many correct answers they got on their homework, but rather if the homework was reasonably attempted or not.  Though sometimes, if she knew a student was struggling particularly hard either in the subject or in other life circumstances and had tried to do the homework, she&#39;d give them a pass without letting them know.  He wanted to impress his teacher with his improvements, but at the same time, he was more nervous because he wanted to impress himself.  Katie, on the other hand, had a beef with Joseph because he smelled bad and wore dirty clothes.  She was looking forward to ripping his shirt in hopes that his mom would simply buy him a new one.  In her mind, she needed to force him to wear better clothes and bathe.  She smiled when she thought back on yesterday when she smeared hand soap into his greasy, unkempt hair.  And so, when both kids were finished getting ready for the day, they both made their way to the kitchen where they smelled their parents cooking pancakes and bacon.  <br />
<br />
After finishing their breakfast, Jeff and Katie made their way through the kitchen door and off to the bus stop where they both caught the same bus since it was a high school bus that served middle school and elementary school kids that lived farther away.  It would go to first Katie&#39;s school and drop off the elementary school students before departing the elementary school to pick up more high school students to drop off at the high school Jeff attended.  When the bus arrived at the bus stop, both kids boarded the bus and sat together in their assigned seats.  Nothing out of the ordinary happened on the bus.  The high school students continued to shoot spit balls out of straws and into Jeff&#39;s hair while Katie withdrew her own straw and started to search for paper to tear up and chew to shoot back through the straw back to the high school students who then started in on her.  Jeff was miserable, but Katie enjoyed the fray.  The high school students had made friends with her despite her age due to her pluckiness, quick whit, snarky comebacks, and overall love for and command of horror films and classic heavy rock music.  But, eventually, the fun for Katie and misery for Jeff came to an end when the bus rolled into the bus parking lot for the student transfer.  Katie looked at her brother and simply said to him, &quot;Bye, loser!&quot;, before firmly bashing her palm into her brother&#39;s forehead and departing.  In some ways she loved him, but Jesus Christ, he was still annoying.  Jeff remained on the bus and returned to his private thoughts  without paying attention to the world around him as the elementary school students departed and the high school students boarded.  A firm hand pressed against Jeff&#39;s shoulder.  He quickly pushed it away saying, &quot;Please, I don&#39;t feel like being picked on today.&quot;, without looking up to see who was placing their hand on his shoulder.  Katie&#39;s principle, who had boarded the bus without Jeff&#39;s knowledge, quickly remembered that this kid didn&#39;t like being touched.  And so she replied, &quot;Jim, it&#39;s me, Mrs Holden, your principle called, he needs you to step off the bus and come inside my office here at the elementary school.&quot;  Jeff, surprised, looked up at her and responded with, &quot;Are you sure?  Why?&quot;  Mrs Holden returned, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure and I&#39;ll tell you once we get inside.&quot;  And so, Jeff quietly got off the bus with Mrs Holden and let her escort him into the elementary school and into her office.<br />
<br />
Katie had made her way to her classroom to wait for class to start.  Being as she got to the school early, she would have normally waited around and had forty five minutes of free time before class started.  However, on this occasion, when she got to her classroom, her teacher promptly told her to go with the school counselor down to her office which happened to be near the Kindergarten wing and the Special Education wing.  Once they made it to the counselor&#39;s office, the counselor, Mrs Clemment, closed the door, offered Katie a seat, and began what she had to say.  &quot;Katie, you&#39;ve been having some problems adjusting to your class, so we&#39;re going to change things up and put you with another class since you keep being mean to the other kids.  We&#39;ve also got some friends for you to talk to help you through your struggles.  They are going to teach you anger management techniques and teach you how to calm down using a special technique where they get you to look at a calming scene while they talk to you.  It&#39;s meant to make you relax and enjoy your talk.  We also have a special room we&#39;d like to try you in so that you can hit anything you like.  Katie understood what the woman was saying.  In Katie&#39;s mind, maybe she could milk the situation and not have to go back to her fourth grade class at all and hopefully get a nicer teacher.  &quot;Okay, fine!  What ever, I hate my teacher anyway, let&#39;s go see this room in which I get to hit anything I like.  The counselor then escorted Katie out of the office through a different door than the one she came in and out into a much different hall.  Katie never got a chance to see the special education rooms as she was directly led to what was called the &quot;crash room&quot;.  The room&#39;s walls were covered in gym mats to prevent injury in case someone smashed into them.  On the floor were several different big thick-foamed pillows covered in blue vinyl. The one thing Katie didn&#39;t notice was the camera in the corner of the room filming everything she was doing.  &quot;Test it out, yourself.  However you like!&quot;, said the counselor.  And so, Katie, in her good change of fortune, noticed a hanging punching bag and started railing into it.  For fifteen minutes, she pounded into the thing like it was  Joseph, the smelly boy in her class, and never noticed that the counselor went away and that a new person, a hypnotherapist, was in the room watching her.  And so when the hypnotherapist called Katie&#39;s name to collect her and show her another room, Katie was surprised.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;, she asked.  &quot;I&#39;m Leah, your counselor wanted me to show you my room and introduce myself since she has other things to do.&quot;  Katie inwardly grumbled, but quit what she was doing and let this Leah lady lead her down the hall to another room.  Once Katie and Leah entered the new room, Katie was well and truly amazed that her school could have a room like this.  It was both light and dark when she stepped inside.  The room had no windows and no overhead lighting in it.  The only lighting came from a wide variety of color changing LED lamps, lamps that had fake fish swimming in them, a projector which had what looked like an underwater theme projected onto the ceiling showing the undersides of real looking fish swimming around with yet another projection on the wall showing more fish swimming around.  There were also a square with different lights that she could push to change the color, a color changing spinning spiral on another wall as a projection, plenty of seating, a ball pit, and a low black painted book shelf with picture books with no words in them.  She could hear ocean sounds and some light sprinkling of soft music playing from hidden speakers.  &quot;Katie, take off your shoes and get comfortable.&quot;, asked Leah in a gentle manner.  Katie, thinking she had nothing to lose, took off her shoes and laid on her back on the floor and watched the fish swim around a bit.  Leah just kind of got up and disappeared while Katie enjoyed watching the fish causing her to fall asleep.  But, in reality, Leah had gone to the sound system to fade out the soft music and fade in children&#39;s nursery rhyme music with a tik-tok sound.  With the hypnotic induction started, she could now start the actual hypnosis.  And so, she went back over to Katie seated herself on the floor where the child was sleeping and started whispering to her.  &quot;Katie, I know fourth grade has been hard for you.  You&#39;ve been failing your grades and picking on other students.  Listen to me, I know your special.  You&#39;re a very special girl.  That&#39;s why you&#39;ve been enrolled in special education.  You don&#39;t have to worry about the difficulties of fourth grade anymore.  I want to help you Katie.  I want to help you learn how to play nicely with the other boys and girls.  There are all kinds of toys for you to play with in special education.  They may be simple oversized toddler and baby educational toys, but they&#39;re so much fun to play with.  Katie, listen to me.  You haven&#39;t done well if fourth grade, but I think you&#39;re a very special girl who has special needs that aren&#39;t being met.  I, your family, and other school staff want to help you with your special needs.  You need to be loved, protected, and safe.  That&#39;s how special of a girl you are to us.  Let go and relax, Katie.  Let go of fourth grade.  You don&#39;t need any of that stress in your life.  Let go of numbers and letters.  All they are is unimportant squiggly lines that make no sense.  There are no spoons, knives or forks in Special education because special girls like you eat with their hands.  It&#39;s so much more fun to play with your food how ever you like while eating it instead of using a boring old fork or spoon and using knives is dangerous for a special girl like you.  You don&#39;t have to worry about getting messy while eating food with your hands.  After all, no one expects a special girl like you to stay clean.  That&#39;s why you wear a special bib!  Oh, my special Katie, you&#39;re going to love learning baby sign language.  It&#39;s so easy that a baby can learn it.  It&#39;s also much more easier for a special girl like you to use baby sign language than it is for you to say stuff out loud.  I know that English is difficult for you.  You don&#39;t need to say anything anymore since you&#39;re going to be in a special baby sign language class.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed that you have an incredibly difficult time trying to say the words.  Yes, a special girl like you will enjoy learning baby sign language.&quot;  Leah noticed that Katie was in such a deep state of hypnosis that the young girl wet herself and so Leah continued, &quot;Katie, you just wet yourself without realizing it.  It&#39;s okay.  All special girls wet and mess themselves without ever knowing it just like you.  That&#39;s why you have special helpers who check on you regularly to make sure your diaper is clean and dry.  Potties, bathrooms, and toilets have no place in the minds of special girls like you.  Special girls like you just passively let their care takers put on and take off their special clothes and change their diapers without complaint.  Katie, you don&#39;t need to know the name of your clothes nor do you need to know about clothing styles.  That belongs in fourth grade right along with the difficulties of knowing how to pick out clothes and put them on or take them off.  No, special girls who are in special education don&#39;t need to know anything about clothes or their diapers.  Instead, they have special care takers who take care of all that difficult clothing stuff for them.  Katie, when I wake you up, you&#39;ll remember all that I&#39;ve told you.  You will notice holes in your memory like you might have at one time known stuff, but you won&#39;t be able to figure out what was supposed to be in those holes.  Katie, when you wake up, I need to make sure you&#39;re safe.  I need to put you in your special needs helmet and mittens so that I know that you and others are safe.  And because I want you to feel safe, I&#39;m also going to put you in your special safety restraint vest and hold onto your leash so that you don&#39;t run off and get lost.  I know that you&#39;re going to love your new special safety gear even though you don&#39;t know the name of your special safety gear.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t want you to be worried about getting on a different bus than normal today.  It&#39;s a special bus designed with special seating with a harness to keep you safe.  I promise you that you&#39;ll feel safe and well cared for on your special bus.  Katie, when I wake you up, I&#39;m going to hand you off to a special helper so that she can change your diaper and put you into your special school uniform.  It&#39;s a solid green jumper which is kind of like a pair of pants and shirt combined.  It zips up the back and has a special magnetic lock to lock the zipper in place.  That lock cannot be removed without a special key.  Your special jumper is specially designed so that it can&#39;t be ripped and is also designed to keep you from digging into your diaper.  You&#39;ll also get matching slip resistant socks to wear around school and velcro strap shoes for when you go home.  I understand that you&#39;ll forget the name of your special clothes, but that&#39;s okay.  You don&#39;t need to remember the name....remembering the names of clothing if for fourth grade.  You aren&#39;t in fourth grade, you&#39;re in special education because you&#39;re a very special girl.  I&#39;m going to count backwards, now, from ten to one.  When I clap my hands, you&#39;ll wake up feeling happy, calm, refreshed and ready to join your friends at your first wonderful day of special education 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3......</p>
