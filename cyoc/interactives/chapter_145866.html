<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allen got home and decided that he was going to do something with all the free time he has now. A sat down on the floor so that he was level with the computer and went online, and started an organization. He named it B.A.M.S (Big Alpha Men Society) and designed so that men 6’5” and above could join. After waiting a few hours he checked online and saw that 7 people had joined. He asked for pictures and saw that they were definitely all big, but not exactly alpha. They were built like sticks, so he got an idea but first he’d wait for more people to join. So he went to bed, and when he woke up he didn’t even bother showering, he liked his musk now. He checked the computer and saw that 50 people had joined by now and he got an idea to make these people more like him.<br />
<br />
He made a first notice on the website telling them: “ B.A.M.S meeting at 8:30pm 4/14/19 at the local gym to discuss plans of what we shall do with our strength.” Allen had about five days to prepare for the meeting so he decided to make something to help the members. He contracted a machine that would go to them what happened to Allen that night but it would need some kind of fuel, that’s when he got a notice that a new man had joined his name was Devin and Allen inspected his picture and saw that he was actually 6’3” just shy of the cut off. Allen gave a smug smile as he knew what fuel he had now. <br />
<br />
On the night of the meeting all 51 of them showed up outside the gym, Allen hadn’t made any reservations to keep the gym empty, but that was fine. As they group approached the fromt desk of the gym the boy behind it asked “ What are you all here for today?” “We holdin a meetin here, I’d like it if you cleared the place out.” He said “I can’t do that, sir” he stammered “Oh, you will.” Allen said giving the boy an intimidating glare. Just then then the boy Mayes an announcement asking everyone exersizeing to leave, Allen and the others looked smug as the place cleared out.<br />
<br />
They headed to the basketball court and all sat “My fellow men...” Allen started speaking “I’ve fallen you today as me, like many of you are tired of being bossed around by all these weaklings.” The men all shouted in agreement “Well what if I tell you that I could make all of you as big as me?” They all looked happy with anticipation “But first, I’ll need a demonstration... Devin! Please stand up!” Devin stood up smiling, he thought he’d get to be the first. “This boy right here... is a liar!” He took Devin and put him next to a wall with measurements on it “See!? 6’3”!” Allen shouted angrily, the rest of them all looked angry as well and Devin was sweating in fear. “I-I thought it was right... I guess my ruler at home is off.” Devin answered weakly. “Boy, I’m not gonna hurt you, I’m gonna help them.” Allen whispered in his ear “Oh... phew.” Devin said before Allen quickly ripped upon Devin’s pants “What are you doing!?” Devin shouted, but couldn’t ignore that he was enjoying this a little. Allen took out a strange chip and placed it in Devin’s asshole “This’ll make you much more useful to us, and help them too...” Allen said smugly as held Devin down. Devin struggled trying to get out of his grasp but noticed it was getting harder, and Allen was getting... bigger? Devin struggled under there as changes started happening to him first he lost all his hair from the nose down. Devin shivered feeling colder, then he noticed his fat and muscle dripping away as as he lost weight 160... 140... 120lbs he could barely even wiggle Apllen’s hands. He felt his sling get softer, and smoother, his hair grew out until it was a bit past shoulder length. His proportions changed as his shoulders got thinner, his waist got smaller, his dick got smaller (only 3”) as his ass got bigger. Then Devin started deminishing in height 6’3”... 6’0”... 5’9”... 5’4”... 5’0”... 4’10”. Devin yelled in a much softer voice “Let go of me, Allen! Let go of me Master?” Allen got off of him smugly as Devin sat there, a mess of sweat and tears as he stood up and saw the world as much bigger. He got scared and quickly hid behind allen, like a good beta sub. Allen reached around him and picked Devin up, putting him on his lap. He took the chip out of Devin’s fatter ass, the chip was pulsing like it was going to burst “Master... I’m okay, you can give them this chip now.” Devin said softly as he started wrapping himself around Allen who looked satisfied and snapped the chip in a jug of water the water turners slightly green. <br />
<br />
“Drink up if y’all wanna get bigger like me!” Allen remarked as they started pouring cups of it, but they were only growing about 2 inches and 15 pounds. One of them asked “How come we’re not growing to your size?” “You’ll need to make more betas, of course. Each one will grow you slightly, each time you drink but none of you will get this big, after all I’m head alpha. The biggest of you will reach 9’8” and that depends on how faster your reach your peak, so have fun!” Allen said with a smile as the slightly larger men poured out of the gym, “What to do with you, Dev?” Allen asked “I’ll go home with you, master.” Devin said as Allen ordered some new clothes for him. An over sized light pink hoodie and some black leggings that came off easily, plus and some women’s size 6 shoes pink, of course.<br />
<br />
As Allen and Devin got home together Allen wanted to use Devin for the first time. They got to the the bedroom as Allen ordered “Suck. Now.” Devin didn’t even need to hunch over as he took the larger mans sick down his throat he never gagged once, after 35 minutes they got ready for bed Allen wearing some rugged pjs and Devin wearing nothing. Allen payed down in bed and Devin stood on the other side “C-Can I join you, Master?” “Sure, but lay down on your side.” Devin did as he was told and latex on the bed looking to his left as Allen rolled over, putting his dick right between Devin’s cheeks. He smiled and blushed, he was being a good beta.</p>
