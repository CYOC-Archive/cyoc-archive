<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brenda was awoken by the sound of her cell phone ringing.  She rolled over to her night table to answer it.  As she reached for the phone she took notice that Tabitha was not in the room.  She was not surprised, however.  Tabitha probably went to have more fun with Ricki before her night ended.  Brenda picked the phone up and pressed the talk button.  With sleep still evident in her voice, she said, “Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Ray’s voice said.  “I didn’t mean to wake you up.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be sorry, Ray,” Brenda replied. <br />
<br />
“How did you know it was me?” Ray asked.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Brenda yawned.  “You’re the only person I asked to call me this early.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Right,” Ray said.  “Are you still up for breakfast?”<br />
<br />
Brenda threw the sheets off her body.  “I sure am.  I’d just need a little time to get ready.”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine,” Ray said.  “So do I.  Do you know where Rutter’s Restaurant is?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Brenda said.  “It’s on 14th Street, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” Ray said.  “Let’s see…it’s a little after 8 now.  Do you want to meet at 9:30?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Brenda replied cheerfully.  “That sounds great.”<br />
<br />
“OK, I’ll see you then,” Ray said.<br />
<br />
“You sure will.  Bye,” Brenda said.<br />
<br />
“Bye,” Ray said.  <br />
<br />
Brenda hung up the phone.  She stretched out all of her limbs as far as they could go, coaxing the remnants of sleep and tiredness out of them.  She stood up and left her room, walking to the bathroom.  On her way she grabbed two towels and a washcloth.  She entered the bathroom and turned the water on, stepping into the shower.  She pulled the level to turn on the shower, and was instantly shocked by the initial blast of cold water.  “Oh,” she said with shock.  The water turned warm quickly, however, and she recovered.  She looked down at her chest and noticed that her body was quite reactive to the cold water.  Wow, she thought while rubbing her breasts, these things get pretty stiff.<br />
<br />
She washed herself quickly, enjoying taking a shower for really the first time ever.  She loved rubbing her hands up and down her body.  It excited her.  As she rinsed off the soap, she continued to feel herself up and down.  Her mind floated off into a daydream.  She imagined that Ray was making passionate love to her.  The thoughts brought a smile to her face.  Without realizing what she was doing, her hand slipped to her pussy and she began to masturbate.  Her other hand rubbed her nipples, making them stand out even more than the blast of cold water had done.  She continued to imagine that Ray was inside of her, rather than her own fingers.  She had an orgasm in the shower.<br />
<br />
After she climaxed, her mind returned to reality and she realized what she had just done.  “I guess my mind got carried away,” she said.  She was amazed to find that a daydream could have such a powerful effect on her.  She made sure that she rinsed her body again, and turned off the water.  She stepped out of the shower, quickly wrapping one of the towels around her hair.  Even though she had never done that before, it came to her as an instinct, just like putting on the dress the previous night.  She took no notice in the fact that she was doing something she had never done before, however.  Her mind was still on what she was going to do with Ray.<br />
<br />
She started to dry herself off, further contemplating her choices.  She wanted Ray.  But she wasn’t sure if she wanted Ray to be a woman.  She recalled her daydream.  For some odd reason, she could not picture him in the dream again.  It was as if the dream had all but slipped from her memory.  All she could remember was that Ray was making love to her.  But in all honesty, she did not know if Ray was male or female in the dream.  It could have been either.  This confusion was certainly not helping her come to a decision any easier.<br />
<br />
She shook her head violently.  I can’t think about dreams, she said to herself.  She had to be realistic.  She began to seriously weigh all the factors in her head.  She knew that she wanted Ray.  She was not sure if it mattered what gender he was.  She also knew that she would feel guilty if he did change.  Even though he would more than likely be very accepting of the change, as everyone else had, she still felt that it was wrong to change him against his will.  But that also meant that changing everyone else would be wrong.  That wasn’t the case, she said to herself.  She did believe that changing other people would result in a lot of problems being solved.  A lot of good would come out of it.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Brenda came to a decision.  “OK,” she said aloud.  “I know I want Ray.  So I have to have sex with him.  If he changes, fine, like Tabitha said, I’ll accept it.  If he doesn’t, that’s fine, too.  I just know that I want him, and I don’t think it matters whether he’s male or female.  He’ll be the same person either way.  He’ll be sweet, kind, caring, courteous and good-natured.  It can work no matter what.”  She smiled.  She felt confident that she had made a good decision.<br />
<br />
She wrapped the second towel around her waist and walked out of the bathroom.  The thought occurred to her that she could not wear the same dress today.  She needed some clothes.  She walked into Tabitha and Ricki’s room.  She found them lying in each other’s arms, completely naked under the covers.  That answered that question, she thought.  As if there was any other answer.  <br />
<br />
“Tabitha,” Brenda said softly.  Tabitha stirred a little.  “Tabitha,” she repeated, a little louder and a little closer to Tabitha’s face.  <br />
<br />
Tabitha’s eyes opened and she looked at Brenda.  “Good morning, sweetie,” she said.  Ricki began to stir as well.  “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“I need some clothes,” Brenda said.  “I’m meeting Ray, and I can’t wear the same dress.”<br />
<br />
Tabitha sat up in the bed.  This caused Ricki to wake up, too.  “You’re right.  You can’t.”  Tabitha threw off the bed sheets and climbed out of the bed.  “Let’s find something casual,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Did you make a decision?” Ricki asked as Brenda walked with Tabitha to the closet.<br />
<br />
Brenda turned around.  “Yes, I did.”<br />
<br />
“Well?” Ricki asked.<br />
<br />
“You’re just going to have to wait and find out,” Brenda smiled coyly. <br />
<br />
Ricki smiled back at her in the same manner.  “Oh, I see how it is.”<br />
<br />
Brenda just laughed at her comment and turned back to the closet.  Tabitha was going through some things, seemingly frustrated that she couldn’t find something.  “What are you looking for?” Brenda asked.<br />
<br />
“A shirt that I know would fit you,” Tabitha replied.  “Something a little nicer than a T-shirt.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not that big a deal,” Brenda said.  “I don’t think he cares that much.”<br />
<br />
Tabitha looked at her.  “OK,” she said.  She reached for a plain, gray T-shirt and handed it to her.  “You’re sure that will be fine?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, I’m sure,” Brenda said.  She was going to make a comment that she didn’t think clothes were going to be needed for a long period of time, but quickly stopped herself since she had told Ricki she would have to wait to learn what decision she made.  “How about pants?”<br />
<br />
“That might be more of a problem,” Tabitha said.  “I’m not sure that anything will fit over your hips.”<br />
<br />
“You had all those old dresses,” Brenda said.<br />
<br />
Tabitha nodded and said, “Yea, but I don’t really hold onto old pants.  Even so, I don’t know how they’d fit on you.”<br />
<br />
Ricki said, “Looks like we’re going to have to do some shopping today.”<br />
<br />
Tabitha continued to search through her closet.  “Ah, here we go,” she said as she pulled down on older looking pear of jeans from the top shelf.  “Try these,” she suggested.<br />
<br />
Brenda took them and unwrapped the towel from around her waist.  She threw the towel to the side and stepped into the jeans.  She put in both legs and raised them toward her waist.  They fit snugly over her hips, but they did go over.  They were a little loose in the waist.  She showed that fact to Tabitha as she asked, “Do you have a belt for them?”<br />
<br />
Tabitha pulled a belt from one of the racks in the closet.  “This one should work,” she said handing the worn, black belt to Brenda.  Brenda looped it inside the jeans and buckled it.  The jeans fit around her much better now.  “This will work,” she said.  “I’m not really uncomfortable at all.”<br />
<br />
“What about panties?” Ricki asked.<br />
<br />
“To be honest,” Brenda said, “I’d rather not wear something that’s already been worn by someone else.  No offense,” she said turning back to Tabitha.<br />
<br />
Tabitha said, “No, I understand you.  Come on, let me help you with your hair.”  Tabitha took Brenda into the bathroom adjoining her bedroom.  She pulled out her hairdryer and brushed the wetness out of Brenda’s hair.<br />
<br />
“I appreciate this,” Brenda shouted over the hairdryer’s motor.<br />
<br />
“Like I said last night,” Tabitha said, “It’s what I’m here for.”<br />
<br />
“Among other things,” Brenda smiled devilishly.<br />
<br />
Tabitha laughed.  “You’re right on that.”  Tabitha finished drying Brenda’s hair.  She took her large hairbrush and smoothed all the nags and snarls out of Brenda’s flowing mane.  It looked very beautiful fully clean and combed.  “Your hair is so gorgeous,” Tabitha said.<br />
<br />
“I think yours is better looking,” Brenda said.  “Blonde women are a dime a dozen.  Redheads like you stand out a lot more.”<br />
<br />
“You’re just flattering me,” Tabitha said. <br />
<br />
“No, I’m not,” Brenda said.  “I always thought that.”  She looked down at her feet.  “I just never told you.”<br />
<br />
Tabitha turned her around and hugged her.  “You don’t have to make up for lost time, you know.  Don’t worry about complimenting me now because you didn’t then.  It doesn’t make a difference to me.”<br />
<br />
Brenda looked at her and said, “It does to me.  I can’t help but feel guilty about how much of an ass I was.”<br />
<br />
Tabitha thought back to their conversation the previous night.  “Is that your decision?”<br />
<br />
Brenda nodded.  “It is.  It’s what I’m going to do.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” Tabitha said.  “I think you’re just about ready.”  <br />
<br />
They walked back into the bedroom.  Ricki was still sitting in bed.  She didn’t appear to be in any hurry to get up yet.  Or maybe she had something else on her mind.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to have to go without a bra,” Tabitha said to Brenda.  “I definitely don’t have any that will fit.  Any of us, for that matter.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t mind,” Brenda said, pulling the T-shirt over her head.  “I’ll do my best to keep them from jiggling.”<br />
<br />
“That might be easier said than done,” Tabitha warned.<br />
<br />
“I’ll try,” Brenda said.  “If not, Ray can at least enjoy the show.”<br />
<br />
Ricki laughed.  “He will if that’s all he gets.”<br />
<br />
Brenda glanced at her.  “I’m not telling you what I’m doing.  You’ll just have to find out later.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” Ricki said, throwing up her hand defensively.  “I’m just teasing.”<br />
<br />
“He said 9:30,” Brenda said.  “And it’s 8:50 now.  I think I’ll get there a little early.”<br />
<br />
“Good luck,” Tabitha and Ricki said in unison.<br />
<br />
Exiting the room, Brenda looked back over her shoulder and said, “Thanks.”  She smiled as she disappeared from sight.<br />
<br />
After hearing her leave through the door to the garage, Ricki added, “I think she’s going to need it.”</p>
