<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark: 17 year old high school student. Medium build, 5 feet 11 inches tall.<br />
Amanda: Mark&#39;s girlfriend, 16 years old, 5 feet 6 inches, B cup.<br />
<br />
As Mark walked through the dusty shelves, a large hourglass caught his eye. It was covered in dust, and was filled with a pile of pink sand at the bottom. <br />
Something about it was very alluring. He reached out to touch it. When his hand brushed against the hourglass though, he jumped and almost screamed in surprise. The sand in the hourglass had suddenly started flying to the top, and when it passed through the center, it was changing from bright pink to a dark blue. In a matter of seconds, all the sand was at the very top, in a deep blue color. For a moment, the sand just stayed there, as if frozen in place.<br />
Then Mark felt something strange. The feeling was hard to explain, but it was almost like he felt some kind of connection suddenly form with the hourglass. The moment he felt this, the sand in the hourglass began to move again, first dropping down to the narrow center, and then a thin stream of sand began it&#39;s descent into the bottom half. Mark noticed that as the sand passed back down to the bottom, it changed back to the bright pink he had seen at the beginning.<br />
&quot;Woah, what&#39;s that?&quot; Asked Amanda behind him.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but you were right about this place, it&#39;s like a real magic shop! Did you see the sand fly up to the top of the hourglass?&quot; Mark asked in reply.<br />
&quot;Yeah I saw it! Pretty cool! I wonder what else they have here.&quot;<br />
Amanda moved on, casually browsing through the aisle. <br />
Mark continued to look at the hourglass for a moment, watching the dark blue sand turn pink as it fell through the center of the hourglass. It looked like it would take at least an hour for all the sand to fall. Mark tried touching the hourglass again, but nothing happened, the sand just continued to fall. <br />
Mark decided to let it keep falling, and he would check on it on the way out of the shop to see how much had fallen. He still felt a strange connection to the hourglass, but wasn&#39;t too concerned about it. Besides, it looked expensive. It would be best to forget about it, there&#39;s no way he could afford to buy it.<br />
Mark caught up with Amanda, and for the next 15 minutes they looked through the many strange things the store held. Nothing appeared quite as magical as the hourglass, though.<br />
As time went by, Mark couldn&#39;t quite forget about the connection he felt with the hourglass. It was a weird feeling... almost as if that sand was pouring directly *into* him.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to use the restroom before we go, wait just a sec&quot; Amanda said.<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to need to as well&quot; Mark replied. The store was small, but surprisingly had separate male and female restrooms. Mark walked into the men&#39;s restroom, went up to the furthest urinal, and pulled down his fly.<br />
It was then he felt something was &quot;off&quot;.<br />
Mark wasn&#39;t normally too concerned about the size of his &quot;asset&quot;.... but he could have sworn it look *much* smaller today then it had in years. it felt slightly thinner than normal, and most definitely shorter. <br />
But then again, he wasn&#39;t one to examine himself too closely. So maybe it was nothing at all.<br />
<br />
As he did up his pants though, he noticed they felt a little long on him, and a little loose as well. Strange, these pants had always fit him so well.<br />
He left the restroom and went back into the shop to wait for Amanda. Soon after, she emerged. As Mark caught her eye, however, it seemed like Amanda was a little bit taller than normal.<br />
&quot;Amanda, did you get taller recently?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;Not that I know of&quot; Amanda replied. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;You seem taller today.&quot; Mark said, looking Amanda in the eye.<br />
&quot;Now that you mention it, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m looking up to you as much as before&quot; Amanda said, and with a smirk continued &quot;Maybe it&#39;s you that&#39;s shrinking?&quot;<br />
After what Mark saw in the restroom, the best he could manage was a nervous laugh. &quot;Anyway, let&#39;s get going, I&#39;m hungry&quot; he said.<br />
They arrived at a nearby restaurant soon after. Mark was feeling self-conscious that something might be happening to him, but wasn&#39;t yet worried enough to cancel their plans.<br />
When they sat down, Mark discreetly put a hand to his groin under the table, feeling out his &quot;member&quot;, hoping to find he had been mistaken before. However, what he found did not put him at ease at all. He was only feeling through his pants so he couldn&#39;t be sure, but it seemed like there was barely anything there at all. What was going on?<br />
&quot;Are you ready for tonight?&quot; Amanda asked him, passing an impish grin across the table. Mark&#39;s parents were out of town, and Amanda had told her parents that she was going on a trip with some friends. In other words, Mark&#39;s home was open to just the 2 of them that night, and they had been waiting for this night for quite some time.<br />
At the thought, Mark felt his &quot;member&quot; start to expand. He felt a bit of relief, maybe everything was normal after all. However, once it had fully erected, it was still not visible from the outside of his pants. Nervously, he tried pushing his thighs together to feel for his sack. He felt it, but it seemed like it was only barely there. And there was another thing that sent and electric pulse through his spine and erect member: his thighs felt so soft pushing against each other.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on? Am I seriously being turned on by my own *thighs*?&quot;<br />
He excused himself to the bathroom, and stood up... only to trip and almost make a faceplant. Recovering, he quickly made his way to the restroom to avoid additional embarrassment. <br />
He entered one of the stalls, yanked his pants down, and let out a gasp. His penis was fully erect, but only about inches long! <br />
His eyes drifted over to his thighs. &quot;What the heck??&quot; he thought suddenly, as he noticed that his thighs (while never being particularly hairy) didn&#39;t have a single hair in sight. And while Mark was only a medium build, for some reason his thighs had much less muscle definition than normal, and looked very soft. The thought sent another electric like pulse through his spine, it was making him super horny.<br />
While he would normally be worried about the situation, he only did what seemed logical in his situation... pushed his soft thighs together, with his receding member in-between. With his now 1.5 inch penis wedged between his soft thighs, he felt ready to burst with pleasure.<br />
&quot;What am I doing? I should be saving this kind of thing for tonight!&quot; he thought for a second, but then was overpowered by lust and began squeezing his penis between his 2 soft thighs. After several minutes, much longer than usual, he finally felt that he was about to come, only for the pleasure to suddenly spread inside his crotch area, and seemed to light a fire of pleasure through his entire body. He gasped suddenly, and then threw his hands over his mouth... the gasp sounded like a 10 year old boy, not a 17 year old man.<br />
He froze for a moment, taking in what had happened, and then slowly directed his vision downwards, moving his thighs aside. Only to see....<br />
nothing. Where his penis should be was just a void.<br />
&quot;Wha.....???&quot; Mark didn&#39;t know what to think. He bent down closer to his crotch, and let out another gasp There was a small Vagina was his dick should have been. He (or was it &quot;she&quot;?) hadn&#39;t seen one in person yet... but of course had seen many online. Suddenly everything clicked. The soft thighs, shrinking height and &quot;asset&quot;.... he was turning into a girl! How could this be happening?<br />
Suddenly she remember the hourglass. &quot;Blue sand turning pink and falling down! That hour glass is turning me into a girl!&quot; <br />
She yanked her pants back on, and was about to leave, but her pants were giving him trouble. She curled them up at the end so they wouldn&#39;t get in the way, and stood up. Judging by the length of the pants, she must have already lost at least 3 inches. A glance down her shirt further confirmed things... her nipples had almost doubled in size, although he was still mostly flat for the moment, looking closely she could see the start of boobs forming on her chest.<br />
She darted out of the restroom, trying not to make eye contact with Amanda. But, she was waiting for Mark, and noticed her instantly.<br />
&quot;Mark.... are you ok? You look... different&quot;. She said. Mark didn&#39;t reply, he just bolted out of the restaurant. Amanda, however, got up and followed her immediately.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that hourglass&quot; Mark said. Amanda looked directly at mark and jumped back. &quot;Your voice!... Wait, how come you&#39;re only barely taller than me??&quot; she shouted.<br />
&quot;Yeah I know... not so loud. Look, the hour glass in the magic shop. I think it&#39;s turning me into a girl. Remember how the sand was turning to pink as it fell down?&quot;<br />
Amanda&#39;s eye&#39;s widened. She normally wouldn&#39;t believe such a thing, but given the circumstances....<br />
Suddenly Amanda smirked, looking Mark square in the chest. &quot;You know, I think you might be right&quot;.<br />
Mark looked down, and saw her shirt was showing 2 small mounds protruding from her chest.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get to that magic shop *now*&quot;. Mark said in a panic.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you wait here? I may be able to get there faster without you, given your... condition.&quot; Amanda helpfully offered.<br />
Mark was relieved. He didn&#39;t want to be seen by too many people. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll meet you at my house. You know where it is, right?&quot;<br />
Amanda nodded, and bolted off towards the magic shop.<br />
Fortunately, Mark was very close to home, and was able to make it back without anyone noticing. She went straight to her parent&#39;s closet, stood in front of the full-body mirror, and pulled off all her clothes.<br />
There was no mistaking it now. She was a girl. She couldn&#39;t quite get a hand under each breast yet, but she was about A size already. Her vagina didn&#39;t look very small anymore, it seemed to be a fairly normal size. She felt her body line... narrowing at the waist, and widening slightly at her butt. She measured her height. 5 feet, 9 inches. She then took a close look at her face. She wasn&#39;t the prettiest girl she&#39;d ever seen, but the face in the mirror was definitely that of a girl. Mark continued to stare at the girl in the mirror, with a sense of panic along side a whole lot of horniness. Well, it seemed that at least she was still attracted to girls, but that was going to make things complicated until she could sort this out, since she was starting to feel horny just looking at her reflection.<br />
The doorbell rang. &quot;Wow, that was fast!&quot; as Mark raced down the stairs, she felt a new sensation... her breasts bouncing slightly with each step. She threw the door open, and Amanda stood there, wide-eyed.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?? Why the heck are you naked you pervert!!&quot; She said, quickly entering and closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
They went back upstairs, Amanda examining Mark&#39;s now B cup breasts.<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m taller than you now!&quot; Amanda suddenly noticed.</p>
