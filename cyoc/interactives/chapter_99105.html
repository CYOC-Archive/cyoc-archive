<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis slept through the rooster call the next morning, instead awoken by the shaking of her torso by Ellie, attempting to wake her up.<br />
<br />
“Lexi! Lexi! Wake up, please!”<br />
“Ughhhh…. what is it?” Alexis asked, tiredly.<br />
“You… you’re… even bigger!”<br />
“Wh-what?!”<br />
“Just look around!”<br />
<br />
Sure enough, when Ellie said that, Alexis was suddenly very awake. She looked down, feeling her legs go even farther down. She felt her ass rub on the side of Ellie’s deck, which was 10 feet away from her gigantic rear the night before. She looked behind, and her ass once again towered over her, rising higher than her head when she sat down.<br />
<br />
“Oh… oh no….” Alexis cried, scared that she had grown again.<br />
“Well… I’m gonna… we need… we need to measure you… because whatever changed you yesterday, it ain’t done…”<br />
“Y-y-yeah… please”<br />
<br />
With that, Ellie crawled down her friends even more gargantuan hindquarters, able to jump straight from them to her deck. She looked back and saw that her friend was almost 10 feet higher than she had been before, sitting down almost 30 feet  up. She remembered that she had a roll of surveyor’s tape somewhere, from when they were renovating the house....<br />
<br />
While Ellie was off, searching for the tape, Alexis took her time to figure out if anything other than a size change had happened. She had no new legs, parts, nothing: it seems she had just grown in the night. She looked back and saw her tail, now as thick as 3 two liter bottles at the base, the hair at the end even longer.  Then her phone vibrated.<br />
<br />
E: found the tape!<br />
A: yay!! also is there any food im starving!!<br />
E: one sec gotta do this first<br />
A: ok<br />
<br />
Ellie came back out, holding the long roll of surveyor’s tape in her hand. She first crawled up her ass to her torso, finding it… 40 feet long. “Holy shit” Ellie said, showing the tape to Alexis and getting a similar result.<br />
“Now, I need you to stand… up… hold the tape, please, and roll it down from the joint of your body.”<br />
“Ok!”<br />
Alexis waited to do anything until she felt Ellie crawl off of her gigantic ass; she could only feel because her rear blocked her from seeing Ellie until she walked several more feet away.<br />
<br />
“Ok… three… two… one…”<br />
She heaved herself upwards, somehow managing to get up with only her legs and willpower alone. She stood there swaying, her udder acting like a cursed pendulum from the sudden movement.<br />
“Oh…whoah… whoah…” she moaned, waiting for her body to calm down. She looked around, and guessed that she was, as she feared, even taller now, but she still felt blades of grass tickle the underside of her udder. She just felt… heavier. She guessed she was almost 30 feet tall at her head standing now… which means… she was almost 60 feet tall, ass included… “oh…oh my god” she said, letting the tape fall from its position on her side.<br />
402 inches.<br />
Her leg was 33 and a half feet long! She got out her phone, leaned around and took a picture, sending it to Ellie.<br />
A: so uh… [picture]<br />
E: HOLY SHIT!<br />
A: yeahhh<br />
E: so i was thinking we needed to weigh u…<br />
A: how??<br />
E: well we had a weight for the cattle <br />
A: unfortunately, + i don’t want to break ur stuff if im too big for it<br />
E: its not like we use it anyway itll be fine<br />
A: ok show me where<br />
E: alright!<br />
<br />
Ellie walked in front of Alexis, who had to follow bending down to see her friend well. Eventually they reached the barn, where Ellie tied a rope to the scale, weighing itself almost a ton, and one to Alexis’ foot.<br />
<br />
A: what are u doin<br />
E: getting the scale out. pull!!<br />
A: ok…<br />
<br />
Alexis moved backwards, pulling out the scale with ease. “Huh, even for all this fat, I guess these legs really are powerful…” she thought as she walked backwards, stopped by the poking of her ass by a tree behind her.<br />
<br />
E: ok step on. u want typed measurement or picture?<br />
A: pic pls<br />
E: ok!<br />
<br />
Ellie untied the rope and moved out of the way, watching her gargantuan friend step onto the scale. She looked down at the display, taking a picture of it for Alexis: the numbers were far too small for her to see anyway.<br />
<br />
E: [picture]<br />
A: OMG HOW AM I EVEN ALIVE !!<br />
<br />
The scale was reading 236.36 tons! Alexis was absolutely humongous now! Ellie did a quick Google search which put her best friend’s weight at… 426,720 lbs!<br />
<br />
A: speaking of weight im fuckn hungry<br />
E: well, what do you want?<br />
A: anythingggg<br />
E: alright… ;)<br />
<br />
As she was typing that, Alexis returned to where she sat last night, simulating a small earthquake when she put her weight down. Her endless bottom jiggled for several minutes, being about 10 feet larger in every direction she now had far more mass to throw around. She both lamented and adored how fat her lower body was: on one hand, the sensitivity and stimulation was intense, and her skin was smooth as silk! On the other hand, though, the constant weight shifting was annoying for her and her sense of balance....<br />
<br />
Several minutes later, Ellie reemerged out back, with an actual tub full of pancakes, cereals, eggs, toast, syrup, and tons of other food. She pushed the tub up Alexis’ steep, soft incline. Once she reached her torso, she opened the box and unloaded the plates of food, miraculously still separate, around her friend’s torso. If there was one thing a body this size was nice for, it was as a table.<br />
<br />
The two ate their shared breakfast, 95% going into Alexis’ mass, they talked and talked until about 7. Alexis still hadn’t finished her meal, but Ellie said she needed to get going.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be late for school again, not in our… er, my last year…” she said, getting up.<br />
Alexis looked up at her, standing there on her ass, saying, “yeah… wish I could go, too… but have fun!”<br />
“See ya later, Lexi!”<br />
“Laters!”<br />
<br />
She felt Ellie finally crawl off of her ass, leaving her alone, still with quite a bit more to go until her breakfast was gone. But she was still so hungry! She figured she had to have at least over 50,000 calories a day to be satiated, which this large breakfast certainly put her on the fast track towards. About an hour later, she finished the meal, resealing the box and dropping it down as close as she could to the deck, still dropping almost 25 feet.<br />
<br />
Alexis then realized that she had had the same shirt on for the last two days, but what was she to wear instead of it??<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m completely alone, AND 30 feet up in the air… it’s not like anyone will know the difference,” she said to herself, smiling mischievously. She took off her shirt, and realized that her bra was tight as well. “Huh, I guess whatever is causing this has also affected my chest… strange,” she said while she took it off, feeling much freer without it’s constraints on. She guessed her breasts had probably moved up about a cup size or two, from the tiny A’s she had had to somewhere around a B. “This is definitely a welcome change…” she thought to herself, walking along feeling much more natural in her form. <br />
<br />
She walked around for a bit, until about noon, when she decided to just watch some videos on her phone for a bit. She didn’t bother sitting down: she decided it wasn’t worth the effort, or violent shaking, to do that unless there was heaps of food or sleep to be had. So she stood, feeling the breeze on her ass, udder, legs, everything, watching silly Vines and YouTube videos, munching on food and drinking from the huge water bottle Ellie had given her.<br />
<br />
When Ellie got home, she cleaned off Alexis again (“I’m so so so so sorry…”), went back inside and cooked up two huge oven-baked pizzas for Alexis and a single, microwaveable one for herself. She barely managed to get these to her friend without spilling them, but the two ate together once again, on top of scenic Mt. Alexis. Ellie took the plates back down, setting them in the box from earlier and going inside. Alexis sent a good night text to her friend, having been completely wiped out by the changes today. She laid back onto her larger, softer ass, eager but worried about the days ahead…</p>
