<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The early morning sun shone brightly as Emily groggily got up. She found herself laying amongst grass and leaf litter and above all naked in human form. At first she felt a bit nervous over being naked, but then she remembered the night before. Buying the magic flower, turning into a sexy brown furred werewolf, hunting, exploring what would be her territory, and then finding Cara out in the woods with her. And what was even more surprising was that Cara wasn't human. She was a werewolf too, with white fur that her very light blond, almost white hair mixed very well with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh,&quot; Emily gave a groan and managed to climb onto her knees.<br />
<br />
As she did so, she looked down at herself. Her breasts had shrunk down to the large B cup size that they had been before her transformation. Her muscles looked a little bit better toned, but still no where near as strong as it was while she was in wolf form. The thing she found herself most frustrated with was the fact that she didn't have the claws, fangs, fur, and power of her wolf form. Realizing that she was human again made Emily give an almost depressed sigh. However, this sigh did not go unanswered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, Em,&quot; came Cara's voice from beside her, &quot;With practice you'll be able to transform at will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily almost squeaked in surprised and turned to see Cara laying beside her. She was equally human and equally naked at the moment. She looked just like she normally did, but Emily swore she get a sense wildness about her friend. However, this sense didn't stop Emily from putting her foot in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cara... you're... you're a werewolf,&quot; Emily stuttered out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Cara answered calmly, though she was just as shocked at finding out what had happened to Emily, at least from how she understood it, &quot;and it would appear that you are one yourself now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily found herself looking down in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you ever tell me?&quot; Emily asked, &quot;we've been best friends for quite a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given your taste in movies, a good part of me has wanted to, but honestly, I was afraid you wouldn't believe me and I'd have to show you,&quot; Cara admitted, &quot;and that you wouldn't respond all that well to seeing me in my wolf form... that you'd fear me.&quot;<br />
<br />
That reminded Emily a bit of what had gone through her mind while she was tracking Cara's scent and trying to figure out why she was out there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask how you became a werewolf?&quot; Emily wondered, &quot;were you born one or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was bitten,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;It happened when I was little. My folks and I were out at this little out of the way camping trip and I wandered off from the campsite chasing fireflies. Apparently in my chase after the insects, I got the attention of some werewolf that was out hunting and it decided I was fair game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily was quick to grip Cara by her shoulders, as if she were going to protect her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can relax,&quot; Cara assured Emily, &quot;I obviously survived the attack. I think it might have been a pup or teenager werewolf that bit me, as it made every possible hunting mistake and I heard it coming. I managed to climb up a tree and get high enough to avoid being its dinner, but it did successfully bite me in the butt. After that, I found I had to become a werewolf myself every full moon and could manage to transform at will when I needed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never harmed my family, far from it, and I somehow managed to hide my lycanthropy from them,&quot; Cara explained, &quot;though for years, I ended up living on people's pet dogs while I was growing up. It was only when I turned fourteen that I figured out how to get to deer and establish my territory here... then I met you and I found a good friend in that you were sort of into werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you thought I'd fear you,&quot; Emily pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it was in the back of my mind,&quot; Cara sighed, &quot;but I think I would have not only overcome it but asked you if you'd want to join me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily ended up giving a low whistle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, is this why you've always been unavailable during the full moons?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
Cara again looked at Emily with a raised eyebrow, again giving Emily the sensation that she'd put her foot in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it's why I lied about having dates or family emergencies,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;it was so I could come out here and enjoy being &quot;wild&quot; for three nights... though I generally wish that turning into a werewolf would result in getting briars in my hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily glanced over to see Cara pulling a briar out of her hair. At first, as Cara explained how she became a werewolf, Emily had thought that Cara's care for her hair and appearance was an act to cover lycanthropy. That was apparently not true. Cara apparently enjoyed both.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you'll be going to the salon since tonight was the last full moon of the month?&quot; Emily teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wolf or not, a girl needs to look her best,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;and besides, you could use a trip yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily only gulped, feeling a bit nervous at having a day off from work. Cara let her joke go, and decided to deal with her own curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you know how I got to be a white furred werewolf, how did you become a brown furred one?&quot; Cara asked, &quot;Did someone attack you? Were you bitten or scratched? Or is Brad a werewolf and you two FINALLY did the horizontal dance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CARA!&quot; Emily shrieked, &quot;No... you know THE Magic Shop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The one that's been downtown for the past couple of days?&quot; Cara wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... well, it's real,&quot; Emily explained, &quot;they had this flower that was supposedly laced with magic that would turn me into a werewolf if I ate it... and if you should know why...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're a fall of all things that go bump in the night,&quot; Cara found herself chuckling, &quot;I suppose I should have thought that out a bit more... I mean if I revealed that I was a werewolf, you probably would have asked me to bite you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Emily nodded, &quot;but maybe we should put that in the past and move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else would pack mates do?&quot; Cara shrugged as she climbed up to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pack mates?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing sexual, I assure you,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;It's our friendship but even stronger. I was a lone wolf... but now you are with me, and we are a Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Pack?&quot; Emily asked as she got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Cara answered and then hugged Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry for attacking you,&quot; Emily said Cara, feeling great feelings of joy at being able to share things with her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You only just became a werewolf,&quot; Cara managed a shrug, &quot;I bet you caught my scent, identified it as me, but since you didn't know that I was a werewolf... you made the assumption that I killed and ate myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, sorry,&quot; Emily repeated.<br />
<br />
Cara nodded and then looked up toward the trees at the edge of the clearing where she could see the sun rising.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I know you had yesterday and have today off, but we're naked in the middle of the woods,&quot; Cara answered, &quot;I'll help you manage transforming on your own, and we'll go back home.&quot;</p>
