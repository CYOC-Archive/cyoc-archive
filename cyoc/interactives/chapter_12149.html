<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Touching the ring, I wished that I was able to breathe underwater. The ring gave me a very odd shock, though nothing to be concerned about. I entered the water, and once I submerged my head, I nervously let a little water into my nostrils. What seemed like hours (when in fact it was only a minute), throwing caution to the wind (and partly because my instincts were screaming for oxygen), I relaxed, sending water down my windpipe, streaming into my lungs. At first I felt a very painful, deep burning sensation, almost as if I was breathing in hot stale stuffy air which had all it's oxygen removed. I tried gasping for air, only to be met with more water rushing into my lungs, deepening the burning sensation. All the while, my body became as stiff as a board, splaying my fingers and toes as wide as possible, shivering slightly due to the shock.<br />
About a minute passed, and gradually I felt the burning subsiding, being replaced by a very pleasant, cool feeling in my lungs, almost soothing. Another minute later, and I was breathing water as if it was second nature.<br />
During my frightening episode, Amanda had noticed my predicament, and approached me, but obviously could not do anything to help. I  opened my eyes, and she was infront of me, her eyes giving away her obvious concern as to my situation. She tried talking, but I still couldn't understand her. I just gave her the thumbs up. But once she saw that, her eyes once again became dark and otherworldly, as if Amanda had disappeared, and the strange, mermaid-like being had once again return. Her eyes spoke of lust and greed, and I could almost swear I felt a (sexual) energy radiating from her mermaid torso, concerntrating mostly around her tail.<br />
I looked her over again. She was beautiful when she was above the water, but she was flawlessly striking below. Her long hair floating around her perfectly formed face, all marks, blemishes had virtually vanished. Her skin a slightly milky white with a healthy pinkish sheen, and flawless. Her hands and fingers very slim, the webbing between her fingersvery transparent in nature, but nonetheless striking. Her breasts full and youthful, sitting high up on her ribcage. Her waist and hips supermodel like, narrow and attractive. But her aqua blue tail was the most striking thing I had ever seen in life. Longer than her legs had been, it was cylindrical in apprearance, start just below her waist , and unlike alot of movies where you clearly see the start of the actresses tail costume, her's I couldn't make out where it started. All you could see was skin, then some blue blemishes inbetween skin, then a few blue scales which increased as you gradually travelled down her waist to her hips. At her hips, you could barely make out human skin amongst the myrid of perfectly placed scales, each overlapping the other seemlessly, and tightly. The tail tapered perfectly towards the tailfin, fishlike in appearance, and had a bluish-greenish tinge to it, the same colours radiating up the tail. It was as if she was pulled straight from a storybook, only she was very much real before me. All the while I was looking at her, I could see her moving her tail, keeping her afloat and upright, and watchnig her tail move and bend, I was trully convinced she was all mermaid, there was definately no sign of any legs there.<br />
She floated towards me, lightly licking her pastel pink lips, fingers fidgeting with the bubbles that her tail was churning moving foward and back below her. Her full breasts floated, proudly defiant of gravity. She moved her lips to mine, her breasts pressing against my chest, stragely warm to the touch. In what seemed like less than a split second, she flung her arms over my shoulders and held me close to her tightly, wrapped her tail tightly around my left leg, and kissed me as passionately as I've never kissed any living woman ever in my life. I closed my eyes, partly because we were moving so much that the bubbles were irritating my eyes, and partly because the sensations she was transferring from her mouth and muscular tongue rendered me lame and helpless. I lost all sense, I only knew one thing, I wanted this creature so badly, so intensely, so completely. I returned the favour, pushing my tongue into her cool, wet mouth, meeting hers, and funnily, our tongues began wrestling. But I was too drunk in sexual ecstacy to be concerned about our contest, and I pulled her closed, squashing her breasts even more against me, somehow now aware of her nipples. Holding her back with my left hand, I let my right hand travel slowly down her back, tracing the indention in the middle of her back that showed where her spine was. As I got to her buttocks, I was amazed to find she still them, the two succulant cheeks very firm to the touch. Yet halfway down her buttocks, I could unmistakably feel the scales making an appreance gadually, though the feel of skin inbetween the scales was strangely reassuring, comforting and passifying. Touching the scales was both exilherating, and scary, and very much unknown. Traveling further down her buttocks, the number of scales increased until only scales could be felt. Another amazing feature I had noticed was that unlike human buttocks, hers tapered into her tail. Stroking the scales, I noticed their slick, smooth surface and texture. Trying to life a scale, I dug my middle and index finger under a scale, and as I tried pulling the scale up, Amanda almost bit my tongue off!! Leaving my hand at her buttocks, we kissed on... until she lifted her right hand off my shoulder, and forcing it inbetween our pressed bodies, she moved her hand down my torso until she could touch it....</p>
