<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was burning up. There was no avoiding that topic. He pressed himself against the ground, trying to just wait and hope that this all blew over...but then before long it was over. The burning sensation passed almost as quickly as it came, leaving a shirtless Mike covered in sweat on the floor. He breathed harshly, his muscled body dripping with exertion...and something else. Mike didn&#39;t know what it was, but it definitely felt like his body was tingling entirely too much now. His breaths were getting shallow as a whole new feeling came to him.<br />
<br />
He got a remarkably dumb grin on his face as he pistoned his hips upward moment by moment, the feeling went from burning hot to now a pleasant, deeply nice tingly sensation that reminded Mike of a blow job. So...was he like, getting a blow job all over or something? His arms quivered and then flew to his chest, feeling up his musculature, from abs to his chest, lingering on nipples that suddenly seemed more sensitive than he&#39;d ever experienced.<br />
<br />
Mike usually refused to let girls play around with his nipples or ass, but now, with how sensitive both were increasingly feeling, maybe some exploration of his erogenous zones was in order. He gripped his right nipple tight with his hand, grunting in pleasure and taking three gasps of air. He didn&#39;t even see that his skin, usually pale, was tanning remarkably quickly. How the skin usually so clammy and hairy was seeing the hair seem to retract - enhancing Mike&#39;s sensitivity - and the skin naturally feeling warmer as his tan deepened and darkened.<br />
<br />
His cock was ramrod erect and Mike almost shouted from how restrained it felt as his modest meat packed on another two inches, placing him at a generous size. Yet for some reason he hoped that nobody would see him as he almost shredded his pants in getting them and his underwear off. Like for some reason having a dick this big and presently erect was...embarrassing with any company beyond one. He couldn&#39;t place the sensation - so he just shrugged and kept going on himself.<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t know what the tingly feeling in his hair portended even as his hair went from typically dark and short to almost charcoal black, growing out thicker and longer, almost archetypally Greek curls forming in his hair. He felt his face start tingling too and he chortled to himself, feeling it with his free hand even as his hand working his meat started feeling up his balls and then explored further to his ass.<br />
<br />
As he felt his face it shifted in form, becoming more effete in form, his lips thickening slightly, his eyes going almost too bright blue, bequeathing the hairless, muscular lad with a look of innocence he hardly displayed. The eighteen year old kept crudely jerking his cock even as he felt his muscles tense and grow - the existing jock musculature shaping up and toning expertly into the sort of powerfully built, muscular Greek form suited for competing in and outright winning the Olympics in ancient times.<br />
<br />
He was if nothing else beautiful in countenance, a Mediterranean tanned hunk that would grab the attention of anyone so inclined toward men, be they male or female.<br />
<br />
It was feeling his finger probe at and touch his sensitive ass that got him going; his orgasm rippled through his body and changed some things mentally, making the young man gasp and curse in an odd language - Greek indeed - and as his cum landed around him, he pistoned his hips several more times before relaxing.<br />
<br />
He took a moment to get his bearings and even longer to manage to reclaim some measure of English literacy. For some reason his English seemed so distant to him now. He pulled himself up and stumbled about. He groaned, &quot;W-Wha---what hah...haaahpenned to me?&quot; He shook his head, Mike was feeling so weird right now. He was almost feeling like Mike didn&#39;t fit him right, but that was his NAME. So weird...<br />
<br />
Looking at the mess he made, the Greek stud chuckled and then looked himself over. It took him a moment to realize it, and before long he was pressed up against the wall. Thoroughly freaking out and obviously not in the know about what happened to him. &quot;W-what the hell!? I-I am...t-tah---tanned! Can&#39;t speak my English as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike then saw what became of him - looking into what used to be the painting of the Greek athlete, he instead saw a mirror, and the image of the himself as the Greek athlete, standing there. &quot;Now...now that&#39;s...how in the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
The former jock felt his new muscles, and while he would&#39;ve loved to be this muscular and fit normally, he was really not in a mood to be celebrating, though as he looked at himself he started wondering. His new body was pretty sweet, and he could probably still have a commanding presence on the football field like this...<br />
<br />
&quot;...And won&#39;t the boys love my ass. Almost as much as the girls love my dic---huh?&quot; He realized what he said after he said it, and again looked at himself. He remembered what he knew about ancient Greeks, and breathed to calm himself down. Even thinking about Aaron or Dean made him chub up again down there, and he wiped his face with his hand. There was little arguing that the change that had happened to him had some interesting additional effects upon his sexuality. Though at least, Mike thought, it&#39;s gonna let me keep on fucking girls. Still, Aaron really worked those glutes, and fucking damn, Dean&#39;s arms are nice, hot and thick.<br />
<br />
Mike found himself starting to grin and think about the guys as much as the girls now more than ever, not bothering to try very hard to stop himself, &quot;I-I&#39;m...I&#39;m straight straight straight...ahh hell, even a straight guy&#39;d wanna fuck Aaron...&quot; Such was what he told himself, the mental changes just about wrapping up - Mike was only just hanging on, and Mikaios the Greek Athlete was prominent. It was not so much an insurgent identity separate from him as a part of himself he now could not deny.<br />
<br />
Mike...Mike was Bi now. And maybe he should try and enjoy that...</p>
