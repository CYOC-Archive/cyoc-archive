<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Larry returned to his apartment, cracked open a beer and leaned back on his recliner in front of the TV.<br />
<br />
Once he was settled in, he then got out his phone and watched the video again. Damn baby-dick loser looked ridiculous; as though for a moment he thought he was a real man.<br />
Earlier he had told the kid he wouldn&#39;t share the humiliating video around...and even with all those book smarts college boy was gullible enough to believe it. Obviously Larry wasn&#39;t going to keep this to himself. He sent it in a group chat to a few of his drinking buddies for a laugh. The shitty WIFI meant it was taking a while to upload though.<br />
<br />
While he was waiting he scrolled through his contacts and sent Greg&#39;s number to Jason. The little queer had caught up to him in the hallway and begged for it. For a laugh Larry ordered Jason to strip down to his underwear. Then he said he needed Jason to go door to door offering every dude on the floor a blowjob. There had been some trouble with the building&#39;s internet lately and he wanted the tenants to have an outlet to take their frustration out on besides their lazy landlord. But obviously Larry wasn&#39;t going to hang around and watch. That sounded fucking gay. He really just wanted the loser to embarrass himself. Besides he figured the cocksucker would be too distracted being throat deep in cock to check his phone until after he was done. And he knew the pushover would for sure would ask every tenant like he was told. Larry grabbed the remote and turned on the football.<br />
<br />
Today was a fucking good day. Here he was just hoping to annoy that smartass punk college kid until he moved out and he netted himself a live-in cocksucker. Even though he&#39;d already just cum twice he felt his cock expanding again at the memory.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the video finally finished sending and he got a reply back.<br />
<br />
[Andy: Woah who&#39;s that? Never seen a small-dick that big.]<br />
<br />
Never seen one that big? Sarcasm wasn&#39;t usually Andy&#39;s style of humor. Larry was hoping Andy would throw off a nasty insult he could use later.<br />
<br />
[Larry: Ha very funny. It&#39;s one of my new tenants, little college punk.]<br />
<br />
[Bruce: LOL, it looks like he thinks just because he&#39;s got twice as much as the usual small-dick he&#39;s qualified to be a man.]<br />
<br />
[Larry: Twice as much? What are you talking about? That dick was 2 inches max]<br />
<br />
[Bruce: ???]<br />
<br />
That joke went over Larry&#39;s head. Maybe he was referencing a tv show or something.<br />
<br />
[Charlie: I hope you showed that little bitch his place.]<br />
<br />
Ah that&#39;s more like it.<br />
<br />
[Larry: Yea sure did, tore him an extra throat and wiped my dick all over one of his little books. Kid was writing some kind of sick fanfic about me. Knew I was 11 inches somehow.]<br />
<br />
[Charlie: Only 11? HA! I never knew you to be modest Larry. We&#39;ve all seen the fucking thing, you show it off every chance you get.]<br />
<br />
Now Larry was convinced all his friends were messing with him.<br />
<br />
[Larry: What the fuck are you smoking Charlie and why aren&#39;t you sharing any?]<br />
<br />
Larry then casually reached down to scratch his balls and noticed something odd. Even though he had felt his dick growing earlier he was not hard. He pulled his sweatpants forward and saw that his cock was bigger than it had ever been yet only semi erect. Despite the strange happenstance, the sight of his enlarged manhood started giving him a full erection. It began expanding and hardening before Larry&#39;s eyes until it was longer than his fucking forearm.<br />
<br />
What the fuck was going on? His attention was then drawn to cheering on the TV, someone had just scored a touchdown; and the player had a big old bulge in the front of his pants. In fact all of them did. He switched the channel to an infomercial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready for the beach this summer with the new slick-guy quick-dry swim-trunks&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a guy on screen with tight swim trunks on and a massive dick snaking down the side of his leg. How had that gotten past censors?<br />
<br />
He kept flicking through channels and it seemed like on ever channel about three quarters of the men were sporting massive bulges. On the soap operas, the sitcoms, the news. All of it.<br />
<br />
Then Larry figured out what must have happened...<br />
<br />
The kid was using some college nerd shit to hack his TV signal and replaced it all with weird big dick gay porn! He probably hacked his phone too. That&#39;s why his friends were acting weird! He didn&#39;t know what was going on with his dick though. Some weird experimental chemical from the college? He wasn&#39;t complaining. But right now Larry wasn&#39;t going to let some microdick college boy make a fool out of him.<br />
<br />
Larry headed up to Jason&#39;s apartment. He was about to start going through his keys but noticed the door was already ajar. Larry could hear the kid talking to someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Don&#39;t write anything else! We have to be careful or something else might get fucked up! Just get back here with my book!&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry threw open the door, for whatever reason the pervert cocksucker was naked again and covered in what looked like dried cum. It also appeared to Larry that the little nub dick may have finally gone down because it was around half an inch long. Before the little dick loser had a chance to understand what was happening, Larry strode forward and knocked the phone out of his hand.</p>
