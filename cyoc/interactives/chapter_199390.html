<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Jeff only made him being naked seem normal to everyone else. His altered lower half is still considered very abmormal.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that he has his udder once more, Jeff happily sits back down at the Chronivac in order to continue his fun. He wanted to try out something that he just now had thought of, and quickly selected just himself as the target.<br />
<br />
What he wanted to do was two things. The first was to give himself a cow&#39;s tail simply because he wanted to try it out. The second thing was for almost the exact same reason. He decided to give himself a pussy, just beneath/in front of his asshole and underneath/behind his udder, essentially right in his taint area. <br />
<br />
Due to the nature of his crotch being mostly udder now, his pussy would mostly be hidden by it and his new tail. But when he was on all fours with his tail raised or moving around, then it would be on full display. The thought was pretty exciting, so he saved the changes, then made one additional edit which made him allowed to go around naked without anyone having a problem with it, then saved that too.<br />
<br />
He felt his skin part beneath his udder moments after he closed the program as his brand new slit opened up. This was followed by the base of his spine growing longer and linger, pushing out a protrusion in the small of his back, which then stretched quite a ways before ending in a hairy tuft that matched his hair color. <br />
<br />
Jeff gave his new tail a couple of practice swishes but ultimately realized that he would at best have only partial control of it&#39;s movements. But that was fine, it was meant to be decorative anyways. So its overall functionality wasn&#39;t as importaint. Jeff did have to adjust his sitting posture however, as his new tail made sitting in a chair without either an open back or a soft surface behind him rather cramped and/or even painful.<br />
<br />
He also adjusted his sitting posture so that he wasn&#39;t mashing his new lower lips against the chair seat as well. It felt kind of weird having an open cavity inside of his crotch, but not in a bad way. It was just a new sensation is all. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, Jeff decided to take a short walk just to see how people would react to him in his new, altered form. He figured if things turned bad that he could just undo it all or make everyone believe nothing is wrong at least. <br />
<br />
He removed the rest of his clothes in order to test out being acceptably naked. And with that plan in the back of his mind, jeff figured that there shouldn&#39;t be too much risk in doing this. So he cautiously opened the door to the rest of the house. <br />
<br />
No one was in his immediate sight, so Jeff slowly walked out of the room on all fours. His tail covered his privates, but only when it remained still like it was currently. If it began moving around, then anyone behind him would get a full view of his pussy. And there was nothing helping to obscure his pair of dickteats anyways.<br />
<br />
Slowly Jeff managed to make his way down the steps, which wasn&#39;t as easy in his quadrupedal form. He had considered standing up for this, but ultimately he wanted to push the goal of staying down on all fours as far as he possibly could, so he opted out of that and just slowly made his way down the steps on hand and foot. <br />
<br />
His large, feminine hips and ass swayed with each and every step he took. He couldn&#39;t even stop it if he wanted to. It was just how his hips moved and turned when he walked. He had a naturally sexy gait and couldn&#39;t stop himself from showing it. That being said, it did make him feel a little self conscious and slightly embarrassed for some reason.<br />
<br />
As he strode into the living room, he came across his older sister Kara and her lesbian girlfriend, Alora. Kara was already 25 years old and lived in her own apartment with her &quot;boyfriend&quot;. By pure chance, Jeff had discovered that Kara&#39;s manly boyfriend was in fact her tomboy friend Alora, and that they were more than &quot;just friends&quot;. Apparently, Kara had come home at some point today with out him realizing it. She was reading something on the couch with Alora using her lap as a pillow while she watched TV. Since their Mom wasn&#39;t home at the moment, and their little sister was completely ignorant of what was really going on, Kara apparently didn&#39;t think she had to hind her intimate relationship as she knew Jeff already knew about it. <br />
<br />
When the girls heard Jeff enter the room, they quickly adjusted their arangement before even looking at who walked in. But when they did finally see that it was just Jeff, both girls had similar reactions. </p>

What does Kara and Alora do upon seeing Jeff&#39;s new lower half?</h3>
