<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{b}III. Beast Shape<br />
This spell allows you to transform yourself or another target into an animal of your choice. You must speak the command word &#39;shape&#39; and focus on the animal you want. To designate a target, point at what you what to transform. If you do not point at a target, you will transform yourself. This spell requires very little energy.{/b}<br />
<br />
&quot;I so command of myself to become for one month as a beast, an animal, something I felt akin with...&quot;<br />
<br />
As there I stood, feeling ever so foolish, waiting for something to happen, as oddly down in my guts they began to grumble. I began to walk around as if expecting some devil force to come and cause my bodily changes.  I had to admit there was one fantasy wish if ever I could find a way, as fancied what it might be like to live in a totally different form, and maybe even gender. I stood and looked around, but saw nothing, so I began to rant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready,&quot; said a bold, baritone voice from seemingly in the room, but not from any particular direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who ever is asking, I stand here as prepared, ready for my personal self to transform, and for not longer than a month, do help me be my most wondrous fantasy self.&quot; I asked, as trying to legally form the limits to a bedeviling contract.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, as you wish, be now as a &quot;SATYR - ETTE ,&quot; it said, as my back stiffened, wondering of how it knew what I liked about being a satyr was but part and the secondary idea was of being as a female; that it suggested that something might mean even more!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why of from all time would I begin to yawn, as if a cloud of weary feelings were settling down to cloak me to getting really tired. Acting strangely, I rather ignored the spirit entity doing the talking, and yawning more, I strolled to my bedroom, and sat first on my bed, as laid back and reclined flat out, I too a nap.<br />
<br />
I quickly fell asleep, as began to dream, feeling of aches in my chest, guts and groin. Mild pains urged me to go for a walk, and I saw me as walking. The more i walked the sicker I felt, as what had bothered greatly about my stomach, my tummy skin was beginning to itch. as either rubbing or scratching seemed not to stop the itch nor did it make it any worse. As I continued to walk, my right leg began to get a cramp. <br />
<br />
As sudden as it was a sharp pain, it shot up from my big toe, along the sole of my foot,  to engulf mys calf, and then adding a twist, it spread though my thigh. To tell of the pain as felt, it was horrid, pure agony of a pain what caused me to fall on the hard ground. I hunched my leg snug to my abdomen, as began messaging a fully leg experiencing a vicious charlie-horse cramp. As imagine if you can the rank pain I felt, but then increased ten fold when my left leg suddenly joined in and both became rigid of every muscle, all together until due to the pain I fainted.<br />
<br />
I was out cold for a while, maybe for more than an hour. As I awoke, my sore leg muscles still ached from the cramping, but as I thought, wishing the pain would subside, about all of my other discomforts seemed to have vanished. I felt better, as slowly sat up feeling then a warm a sensation about my body, arms and legs. <br />
I reached to do a arm and hand stretch,  and as they stood held out in front of me,  and seeing them that made me feel sick all over again.<br />
<br />
A smooth, silky feeling as dense a coat of short hairs had then adorned the back of top of my hands. As I rotated both arms and saw there they too had a similar fur covering of hairs, but being longer and rather shaggy. Feeling suddenly giddy, I combed my nimble feeling fingers through the growing forest of hair what at first seeing it made me feel sick.<br />
<br />
The sick feeling faded quickly as I sat looking at what seemed different about my knee. As I began to take inventory of what other things were now different. I started by the unbuttoning my shirt which seemed far too tight proved to offer a sensational realization. As had shaggy thick hair which sprouted from my arms had covered my shoulders, and across my upper chest, I combed my fingers through the hair as it coated my tummy with an extra thick matting of shaggy hair. It was as searching fingers moved about my new forest of fur that they came in contact with something very sensual.<br />
<br />
Soft dark brown skin and puffed up muscle mixed together with my perked and hardened black nipples. Smoothing through lightly hairy palms over this inflated part of my chest he closed his eyes and drank in more sensual feelings. It so impassioned me, giving a sense of arousal, I was sure I had just pissed in my jeans. <br />
<br />
A quick shoved hand down the front of my jeans, it began as searching under the Jeans tops to try at grabbing my penis to hold back the flood. As fingers reached to finding their expected catch, I felt my underwear as soaked wet. I worked my hand at searching, to grab at my aroused penis, only to find it seemingly as totally missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missing, gone, oh no that can&#39;t be,&quot; I yelped, horrified but not remembering my fantasy wish made of what if possible, I would rather try being for a month. A slow push down of my Jeans as I tried to Jump to a standing position, with shaking hands took a firm grip of the jeans, dragging them and the damp underwear down to my knees.<br />
<br />
Standing there precariously, not as well balanced, I leaned forward for a look and in fond hope of finding what my hands could only suggest was then missing; all I could do was to stare at my lower self. In a frantic sense of horror, I searched using hands and fingers at picking through the furred crotch looking for a feel of even a smaller maleness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gone?&quot; I exclaimed, feeling stupid and puzzled over what was happening.<br />
<br />
Then my left index finger sunk past some opening, it felt moist, as highly sensual, an opening in my groin. I shoved in my other fingers, feeling, searching, attending to my new opening; as felt a warm flowing sensation moving up as in from my probing fingers do a toying.<br />
Standing upright as I leaned forward, wanting to see what my fingers slithered inside, as realizing then I had grown a vagina. That warm sensation reached up all the way into my head making me to feel dizzy, wanting to swoon!<br />
<br />
Staggering about some, I reached to grip my hairy hands to grip my knees. Stumbling over the heaped Jeans piled around my feet, I went to step out of my clothes, as socks and shoes went with the jeans; I saw then my legs for what they had then changed.<br />
Stunned, I saw not my athletic legs that ran me to winning my races. Instead, my thighs and leg looked slim, graceful, and sensual, as from my furred groin the body fur covered my butt, thighs, legs, as thinned and shortened about my new hind hocks, long as narrow feet, and the fur stopped at the peak of my new cloven hoofs. Struggling to stay balanced and standing, I stepped a high stride to leave my clothing in a heap on a lawn.<br />
<br />
Feeling very horny and aroused, my vagina weeping, my heart beating at a very fast rate. I was beginning to sweat, the hair covering my body was holding in the body heat and all this made me feel all the sicker.  Sighing and trying to relax and collect my thoughts, I walked away from my Jeans, socks, underwear, and shoes, as taking long stride steps, and rather finding my walking on animal hind legs as something sensual.<br />
A deeply inhaled breath that was a try at relaxing did just the opposite. My chest rose differently when I inhaled, and those seeking, searching hands and fingers felt about my puffed up chest. My chest looked enormous, as fingers felt, they found with ease my nipp;es as puckered hard. As yet there was more, my furry chest  looked oddly plump, my pecks looked, were the size of womanly breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy, I grew a vagina under my furry groin, and now tits, tits, I&#39;m hairy, shaggy, covered his sensual hair! Got legs like a goat, is this a dream?&quot;<br />
I pinched my puckered black colored nipple and yelped &quot;Ouch!&quot;<br />
I&#39;m dreaming this and will soon wake up in my warm bed by the window,&quot; I moaned, as felt that seeping wetness begin to soak my groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this is me, I have a furry body, legs, hooves, and tits with a vagina, I am a female goat, no wait, I am as the spirit said, a Satyrette!&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt the urge to stretch, as first one leg and then the other feeling of my thighs with nimble fingered hands. The hair was quite shaggy at the thighs and quickly shortened and thinned as it sprouted below my knees. It was as I drew up my left leg and fingered the length of the foot, I touched my hoofs, cloven hoofs!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck, I have hooves, cloven hooves,&quot; I moaned, as saw and took first note of something yet ignored. In my mind my fervent wish had come to reality, I was as a satyr and changed to being a female. If I were gay I would be in heaven, but this was to last for a month. As yet a month, thirty days and twenty-nine nights, how will I live, where could I reside, what else would happen I I was sighted, chased, and caught?<br />
<br />
I felt wildly alert and with a new sense of passion I looked  at what was me, my thighs and legs were like those of a goat. I longed for a mirror with thoughts which would rival any female wanting to lust over her own good looks. A giggle and then two as I was finding this changed and matured female form to be for me as a dream coming true!</p>
