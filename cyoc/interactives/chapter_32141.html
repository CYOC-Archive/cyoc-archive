<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>The bigger guy walks up to Jesse, staring, unbelieving that he was seeing what he knew he was. Jesse sat there, fluffy wolven tail swishing back and forth in the open air, generating a slight breeze, happy and proud of his new appendage. The bigger guy stops in his tracks, not really knowing why, but figures it out as soon as Jesse turned around on his stool. Jesse smiled, looking the guy right into his eyes, just as the bartender had earlier with him. Jesse chuckled a bit, knowing what the guy wanted, even though no word had been spoken.</br>
<br>"Hey bro, what's up? Is there something you want?"</br>
<br>He hesitated for a moment, standing there in his tight and white wife beater, showing his macho pecs and his trimmed brown chest hair along with his tight thigh hugging rugby shorts. He didn't know what to say, but he cleared his throat and said whatever came to mind.</br>
<br>"I... I guess I do want something."</br>
<br>"Oh yeah... and what would that be?"</br>
<br>"Honestly, I don't really know, but off hand I want to make sure I am not seeing things. I think I have had way too much to drink and now I am hallucinating. There is no way that a human being can have a wolf's tail!"</br>
<br>"Why do you say that? You don't think it is the least bit possible? As my bartender friend here explained it to me, when we are in the womb and all that fluid when we are developing, we have several animal characteristics. We have gills like a fish, we have a tail like a lizard and we even have webbed hands and feet... see?"</br>
<br>Jesse held up his hands, spreading his fingers apart, showing that even out of the womb and grown as a human-being, humans all still have that animal characteristic about them.</br>
<br>"Well I guess that is true enough, but how did you get that tail?"</br>
<br>Before Jesse could say another word, the bartender cleared his throat, breaking the conversation between them, just so he could interject.</br>
<br>"Well kid, it's funny that you ask..."</br>
<br>Interrupting the bartender before he could say something else, the big guy spoke up.</br>
<br>"Hey bud, don't call me a kid... alright? I am twenty-five years old and by todays standard, that would make me just as much an adult as you are! Got me? The name is Mike by the way."</br>
<br>"Yeah, I got you alright. The name is Gary and I apologize, but I am forty-five years old and I just call anyone under my age a kid, no disrespect intended. Not to mention, I have been forty-five since the day I first came here fifteen years ago."</br>
<br>Mike shook his head in disbelief. "What!?"</br>
<br>"Yeah, I know that is definitely hard to believe, but let me explain as I was going to do before you interrupted me. Here at Pleasure Island, magic is afoot and things happen to people here. For starters, there is a special mix that you can drink that will bring out the animal in you, allowing whomever with the animal in them released can change into the anthropomorphic version of themselves. Basically, an anthromorph is a perfect blend of half human and half of whatever animal you as an individual identifies with the most. Jesse has a wolf's tail because he identifies and holds wolves close. I myself held bears close, both the animal and human male type, so when I drank the mix fifteen years ago I got a bear's tail."</br>
<br>"So what makes you not age?"</br>
<br>"That is a combination of factors, the first is the place itself. Pleasure Island takes on many forms throughout the years, taking form to fit the crowd at the time Pleasure Island wants to make itself available to the world. When people enter this place, time stops in the outside world, freezing things and keeping them exactly the way they were until the person decides to leave. There have been people who have come here, enjoyed what this place had to offer for lengthy periods of time, who didn't drink the mix and then went back to their lives when they had enough. Here, you can be anyone or anything you want to be, but none of it is permanent unless you have the mix. There have been people who have been anthros temporarily, enjoying it both gay and straight... sometimes in between, just to have experienced it. There have been others who changed their sex, their body types, or anything else about themselves to know what it was like."</br>
<br>"So... can you leave this place changed, either changed temporarily or permanently?"</br>
<br>"Yes, but if someone takes on the temporary change, they create a parallel life to their own, one where they are what they are... that is until they decide to return here and remove whatever it is that enables them to be different temporarily. These cases are never heard of because they never come into your normal world. The ones you do hear about... well that is another thing."</br>
<br>"So you are telling me that when some nutjob claims he saw a werewolf for example, he was telling the truth and not off his rocker?"</br>
<br>"Correct... unfortunately you are absolutely correct. I say unfortunately because there are hundreds, if not thousands more of us out there in your world, living just like anyone else would, but just able to change into an animal creature when we want. We totally have control over ourselves, from when and where we change to what we do when in our anthro forms. The ones you hear about are the ones who think that we are better than you humans, that we are the next step in evolution and we should be worshiped as gods, or something of the sort. It is kind of like what the Nazis thought when they were taking out the Jewish people, led to believe that the Jewish were the plague upon mankind, all by one man who was insane and wanted total power along with world domination. I want you to know RIGHT NOW, that I do not believe that about humans or about the Jewish people or the people who follow that way of life."</br>
<br>"Got it... so what is this mix you were talking about? How can I get some? I have always found myself to identify with bearish men, especially when I let my chest and facial hair grow out."</br>
<br>Gary smiled hearing that, but then blushed when he realized a hot guy like Mike took notice of his smile. "I can make it for you, just like I did with Jesse here. Once you finish it, you will find out what you are to become shortly after finishing the last drop."</br>
<br>"Alright, why don't you make me one of them?"</br>
<br>Gary nodded, then went to work pouring a mix of liquids into a large beer mug and slid it over to an empty bar stool a couple stools down from Jesse. Mike sat down while he picked up the glass. Bringing it to his nose and lips, he could smell how sweet it was and when he drank the first little bit of it, he smacked his lips while enjoying the flavor. It was full of flavor and as sweet as it smelled. Mike quickly guzzled the whole thing down, slamming the mug on the bar as soon as he finished. Sitting there for a moment, hr could feel a tingle form at his butt, feeling kinda weird but good at the same time. Suddenly, he could feel something push at his tail-bone and he reached into his pants to feel what it was. When he touched the nub, he felt a bit of a protrusion as well as hairy skin. Not realizing what he was doing, he squeezed it slightly, his eyes rolling in the back of his head, overwhelmed by how erotic it felt. Jesse stared, seeing that he obviously was enjoying his tail too, especially with his "snake" straining against the rugby shorts. Gary ducked under the open part of the bar for escaping, curious to see what Mike was growing back there, Once at Mike's stool, he grabbed at the seam of the shorts and ripped a hole in Mike's pants. His eyes widened and he smiled, seeing that Mike too had grown a bear's tail.</br>
<br>Gary was extremely happy, knowing that Mike would make one hot bear man when he fully transformed. Another benefit for both him and Mike, was the fact he knew that bears only played with their kind, and that was exactly how Gary was. Gary knew that he would finally be able to get his rocks off with another bear, especially since it has been a few months since the last man that came to his bar turned into a bear, then left shortly after to live in the world outside of magic.</br></p>
