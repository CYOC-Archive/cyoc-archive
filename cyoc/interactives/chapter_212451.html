<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Knowing that he&#39;d have to go to work, tomorrow, Chris decided to leave Melanie&#39;s balls and experiment with the Controller of Reality.  The question is, how do you leave someone&#39;s body part?  It might be a natural ability of humans, but Chris came from a reality without.  And while Melanie was the one who absorbed him, it was he alone that had the ability to release himself.  He did this so that he couldn&#39;t be kicked out before he had his fun.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, releasing oneself is a surprisingly simple task.  All one has to do is mentally will it.  Suddenly, Chris felt a familiar sensation of his body liquifying, as gravity finally won and he found himself slipping out of Melanie&#39;s crotch.  Melanie gasped in surprise, obviously not knowing when or where Chris would slip out, as the man reformed into a slump on the floor.  He took his first breath since yesterday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back, Chris,&quot; Melanie said.  &quot;Did you enjoy yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris decided to take a chance and be blunt.  &quot;After tasting and smelling your penis on my face since yesterday?  It was a treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rather than be weirded out, Melanie giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;  Mrs. Hatcher came from across the greenhouse.  &quot;So you&#39;re Chris, huh?  Nice to meet you.&quot;  She reached out for a handshake, which Chris accepted.  As he did so, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how many hand absorbtions have occurred because of the gesture.<br />
<br />
Chris turned toward Melanie.  &quot;Can I get into your apartment?  I&#39;d like to grab my things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;d like to get your shirt back on.  Maybe next time, respawn in a more private place.&quot;  She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Chris blinked.  Through the experience, he had almost forgotten that he was now standing buck-naked with two (dicked) women.  If not for his recent experiences, he would&#39;ve tried covering himself up immediately.  He still felt VERY exposed, though.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hatcher spoke up.  &quot;Wait, before you leave...&quot;  She knelt down in front of Chris, lifted his (comparably smaller) penis, and licked his balls.  An interesting comparison to when he was the part getting licked.  &quot;For old time&#39;s sake.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Melanie led Chris back to her apartment, he experimentally swirled his own tongue in his mouth.  There was definitely more tongue in there.  He stuck it out, and licked his own nose, an act that was previously impossible.  He wondered what other applications a dog tongue might have.<br />
<br />
They reached Melanie&#39;s apartment, and Chris watched as she pulled her apartment key out of her pouch.  As she led him in, he noticed how the door frame touched the ceiling.  Inside, he could see across the apartment that the bathroom entrance was the same.  Was the apartment just built this way, or are doorways taller now to account for antlers?  She led him to a cabinet in the corner, and opened it up.  &quot;Here&#39;s your things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris grabbed his clothing (what remained in this reality).  Looking toward Melanie, he noticed she was waiting for him to finish.  Seemed that just because people had open boundaries didn&#39;t mean that people would leave a near-stranger alone in their apartment.  Chris put on his shirt, and sat down on a chair to put on his socks and shoes.  It felt strange to sit his bare bottom on someone else&#39;s furniture.  He made a mental note to watch what he sat on, or else wind up with a splinter in his butt or something.<br />
<br />
Getting back up, he next reached for his wallet, and was about to put it in his hoodie pocket, when he remembered that he now had a pouch.  Lifting his hoodie and stretching his pouch open a bit, he put his wallet inside.  Shoving an object into an orafice that previously didn&#39;t exist was surreal.  He felt the outside of his lower belly, feeling his wallet through the outer layer.  And he could also feel the wallet being snugged in his body.<br />
<br />
Chris looked back up at Melanie, who was still waiting.  The situation felt awkward, and he wanted the chance to enjoy his changes in privacy.  He had an idea, though.  A change he already had in mind, and it would come in handy in this situation.  Chris grabbed the Controller of Reality, and quickly started looking for the option he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey, that thing.  What is that?  It looks interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you later.  ...By the way, you can leave, if you want.  I kinda want to take my time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie eyed him suspiciously, albeit with a smirk.  &quot;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to leave you alone in my apartment, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aha, found the option!  Chris applied the change that made humans incapable of lying.  &quot;I will not steal anything or eat all your food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Okay, then!  If you leave before I get back, lock the door behind you.  And come up to see me before you leave, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie turned and left.  Success.  If humans couldn&#39;t lie, then Melanie had no reason not to believe him.<br />
<br />
Although, that made Chris wonder, is he still capable?  He tried to tell some lies.  &quot;My name is Chris.  I am male.  Yes, I am male.  I work at an ice cream shop.  I am not the manager.&quot;  Okay, so despite him remembering a life able to tell lies, he is no longer able to.  Come to think of it, he allowed Mrs. Hatcher to lick his balls without resistance.  So changing human nature affected him, as well.  Sounds fun, what else could he do to change his behavior?<br />
<br />
Chris went into Melanie&#39;s bathroom, and looked in the mirror for inspiration.  This was the first time he got to see his leafy antlers.  As with everyone else&#39;s, they were wooden, with leaves sprouting here and there.  They weren&#39;t small leaves, either.  About the size as your average tree leave.  Chris reached up and tugged at a leaf, but stopped when he felt pain.  Seems that pulling at leaves is a similar experience to pulling hair.<br />
<br />
He looked at his pouch.  A small opening below his belly button, bunched up and able to be stretched open.  He could see the faint outline of his wallet within.  Pulling his pouch open, he looked inside.  The skin was darker, but otherwise didn&#39;t look any different.  Reaching a hand inside, it didn&#39;t feel different, either, aside from the obvious sensation of his skin hugging his hand.  He also realized there were no hairs inside.  Wondering how much his pouch could hold, he spread his hand open.  It definitely had its limit.<br />
<br />
Turning to the side, he eyed his Shiba Inu tail in his mirror.  Instinctively as a result of his happiness, it started wagging.  Then it stopped wagging at his curiousity.  Could he move it on his own?  It took some effort figuring out the muscles, but he managed it.<br />
<br />
Then he looked at his face, and stuck out his tongue.  That was definitely a dog&#39;s tongue, and a long one.  What sort of things could he do with it?  He remembered how Mrs. Hatcher licked his balls, and earlier licked him when he was Melanie&#39;s.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he got his inspiration.  Grabbing the Controller of Reality, he first made humans naturally more flexible.  He also altered their body proportions a bit, making their necks longer, while shortening their legs a bit to compensate.  Arm-length, in fact.  Chris lost his balance a bit as the changes rippled through reality.  Looking around, he realized that he had lost a bit of height.  Maybe he overcompensated a bit.  Looking in the mirror, though, the sight was interesting.  His neck had to have been twice as long.  And his shorter legs made his overall appearance a bit ridiculous.  But, these proportions would seem normal for everyone else in the world, so he didn&#39;t fix it.<br />
<br />
Now comes the fun part.  He made it so that humans tongue-bathe themselves.  This time, he didn&#39;t notice anything when he applied the change, not that he expected any.  Immediately wanting to test out his newfound flexibility, he sat on the floor, and lowered his face to his crotch.  The task was surprisingly easy.  He then started licking his penis and balls clean.  This was the first time he had tasted his own genitals.  It wasn&#39;t a bad flavor.  Rather than stop himself, he felt inclined to continue the process, twisting himself and clearning his own behind.  This was NOT such a good flavor.  He kept at it, though, despite himself.  Afterwards, he decided he could save the rest of his body for later, and got up over the floor.<br />
<br />
Looking over towards the toilet, he was glad to see that toilet paper was still a thing.  But something seemed off.  Looking around, it didn&#39;t take long to realize what it was: Melanie&#39;s shower was gone!  In its place was a space with a counter and a window.  Chris realized that if humans tongue-bathe themselves, there&#39;s no need for bathtubs.  He was slightly disappointed by this turn of events.  He was going to miss hot showers.  He considered undoing this latest change, but decided he wanted to live with it, for now.  Maybe hot tubs still exist.</p>
