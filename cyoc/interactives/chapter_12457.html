<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you and Jack turned yourselves into girls for each other didn't you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, we did&quot;<br />
&quot;But you really just turned yourself into girls and then fucked and then turned back, right?  I mean, you didn't spend any time as girls&quot;<br />
&quot;That's pretty much right&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, how 'bout it . . Sis?&quot;<br />
&quot;What'd you have in mind?&quot;<br />
Mark hadn't thought it through.  &quot;Um, how about a week with no one remembering afterward?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony agreed but the St. Martin brothers agreed to put their proposal to the entire group on Sunday night when everyone gathered.  Jeff, Jack and Eric were surprised enough to see that Mark was already not a fly.  But they were taken aback by his proposal.  At least Jeff and Eric were.  Jack was willing to go along with it.  Hell, he'd already traded penis for clitoris once and immediately given it a test drive.  But Jeff was resistant and Eric was adamant about not doing it.  However, neither had any principle to his position other than fear.  And with the chronivac's ability to wipe away any traces of their female week, fear seemed a flimsy position.  What's more, fear seemed positively weak and that's how Mark, Tony and Jack argued it.  You won't remain women.  No one will know you were a woman.  The only effect will be that you know how it will feel to be a woman.  Is that something to fear?  Will knowledge of how a woman feels make you less of a man?  With sighs of resignation, Jeff and Eric agreed to the plan.  They would all accept random changes into women for one week.  All five would have their male identities intact, but they would only be a minority presence in their female minds, a sort of emergency brake, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Tony agreed to go first, but unbeknownst to him, his change was not really random.  Jeff was still a bit annoyed at being talked into doing something.  He resolved to make sure that Tony had certain attributes.  Tony stripped in front of the emitter, next to a mirror, and Jeff typed then pressed enter.  Tony felt the familiar electric wave pass through his body.  <br />
<br />
Immediately, skeletal changes commenced from the top of his body going downward.  His skull becames slightly smaller and his nose assumed a smaller, upturned shape.  His lower jaw shrank and then his shoulders narrowed considerably.  His ribs altered and arms, hands and fingers shortened.  Tony felt his pelvis widen considerably and his legs shorten.  In the mirror, he watched his male model's skin become even finer and his lips become even fuller.  All over his body, he was now losing muscle mass, down from his 167 pound male model/athlete body to a 5'8&quot; 117 pound female form.  The two exceptions were his muscular round ass, which widened to a luscious, full, woman's derriere and the breasts sprouting on his chest.  Tony stared down in fascination as his flat male chest grew two hemispheric bulges.  To his amazement, two &quot;D&quot; cup breasts formed on his chest, bigger than seemed likely for his slender female body.  Jeff smiled at Eric and both smirked at Tony's fantastic mammaries.  Tony's hair became female, disappearing from his face and body and growing long out of his head till it was shoulder length.  Last, the penis and scrotum of which he was proud diminished to half their normal size, then just one quarter then, his penis, just a clitoris now, disappeared within the vagina that formed at the base of his abdomen.  <br />
Tony, now Toni, smiled at his friends and twirled a full circle.  &quot;What do you think?&quot; she asked, her voice a high, soft whisper.<br />
<br />
Jack laughed looking at his naked 36-23-36 friend.  &quot;You're smokin' hot!&quot;<br />
&quot;You're pretty cute yourself&quot; said Toni with a soft pat to Jack's buns.<br />
&quot;Um, you should be aware of what the chronivac came up with for you&quot; said Jeff as he typed and then pressed the emitter sending an electric wave through Mark.  Mark was going to get the exact same transformation as Tony.  Only, Jeff had messed up and given Mark the same age in his new profile, 16, as Tony.  Mark didn't lose any height at all and his weight barely changed.  He was already 5'8&quot; and 117 pounds.  But in just a minute, he was she as Mark St. Martin became Mary St. Martin.  As the process finished and Mary realized she was nearly Toni's identical twin, Jeff apologized for having messed up and not reset the age of Mark's new profile.  Mary didn't mind it at all, she would just be Toni's twin sister now.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you really need to understand what you're getting yourself into&quot; said Jeff.  He told the St. Martin sisters that their settings for sexual desire were maximum and their settings for inhibitions were minimum.  &quot;You actually seem to be, well, sterile, but still you two need to be careful that-&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni laughed out loud with a sudden realization.  &quot;I'm a stripper at the 'Gentlemen's Club' at the edge of the city&quot;<br />
Mary laughed as well.  &quot;We dance together&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh my god!  We do!&quot;<br />
With that, the St. Martin sisters began an impromptu show for their friends, shaking and grinding to the beat they 'remembered' from their act.  The eyes nearly popped out of Jeff, Jack and Eric's heads at the sight of their former friends, now beautiful exotic dancers masterfully shaking all they'd got.  Eric smirked at Jeff.  Brilliant.  They're total sluts and they love it!<br />
<br />
Next was Jack and Jeff let his transformation be truly random.  Jack turned into a petite red haired girl, 5'2&quot; tall and just over a hundred pounds.  Jeff saw that the psychological elements of Jacqueline's new profile made her a prim and proper sort of girl.  Jacqui immediately let out a surprised shout and tried to cover her perky little breasts and slit.<br />
<br />
And Jeff accepted a fully random transformation for himself as well.  He ended up as a voluptuous brunette, not a bimbo like Tony and Mark nor a prude like Jack.<br />
<br />
Eric thought of asking Jeff to surreptitiously change all the settings to make him look like his dream girl, but everyone else's had gone so well and mousy Jacqui was nosing around the chronivac, asking questions of Jeff, so they simply ran it as a random change.  There wasn't really any risk, was there?  <br />
<br />
Eric stripped off his clothes and stepped in front of the emitter.  Eric was a heavyset young man.  He was even heavier as a woman.  And he was a half foot shorter.  Eric morphed into a pear shaped buddha-ette, not asian, but with a huge, fleshy new body.<br />
&quot;No! This can't be!&quot; shrieked Erica.  But it was true.  She had as strong a libido as Toni or Mary but within a body not so likely to inspire reciprocal feelings.</p>
