<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;In the bedroom.&quot; Came a baritone voice it took Brandon a moment to recognize. When he stepped into the room he was stunned at the man sitting up naked in his bed browsing on his phone. It was still Jake, at least, the face looked right behind that shaggy blond mop of hair and the now full beard. But the body...<br />
<br />
Jake was now easily the size Brandon was in his prime, a heavy body builder physique, but his youth meant where Brandon had just been big Jake showed of every muscle in all it&#39;s glory. He must have been almost 220, with almost no body fat. It was the body Brandon himself had hoped to have after Jannes&#39; serum was over. He felt jealous, and aroused. Jake grinned as he noticed Brandon looking him over. &quot;Like what you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it was a good trip to the doctor, you&#39;re filling out the shirt more.&quot; Jake said as he looked Brandon over. &quot;Take it off, let me see.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then Brandon was stripping out of his shirt, tossing the garment aside. Sure enough he was filling out, and more of his chest hair was filling back in. He ran his fingers over his pecs as he sat on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I think we need to figure out what we&#39;re going to do.&quot; Brandon blinked at the sudden topic change as Jake rolled on. &quot;No one is going to believe I am who I am, and definitely no one is going to believe who you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you..&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake cut him off as he turned the phone around, his old face smiling cockily back at him from the screen. &quot;Did a little digging. Are you really this Brandon Whyte, homophobe and corporate mega-douche?&quot; Brandon bit his lower lip. What was wrong with him, the serum was supposed to be restoring his masculinity, but it was just making him bigger and furrier, he was still...<br />
<br />
Brandon pushed himself off the bed and went back out to the living room. He heard Jake following but paid it no mind, even as he heard the words. &quot;Money like that, you and I could start a life together. C&#39;mon man, I know you&#39;re into me, and I don&#39;t care who you used to be, I like this you..&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon scanned the other vials in the case and there they were. Two orientation vials, one for each way, Jannes had told him not to take two, and he passed up getting his personality back for his muscles. If they would even have restored his personality and not just made him a sub for women. Fuck. He grabbed the vial, maybe Jannes would be wrong. He was about to put it in the injector only to have it wrenched out of his hands by a much stronger Jake.<br />
<br />
Everything finally broke and Brandon took a swing and punched Jake right across the jaw. He may have been slowly regaining his strength, but Jake still had a good forty pounds on him. The swing that Jake offered in return sent Brandon sprawling to the ground, hitting the floor was the last thing he felt before he blacked out.<br />
<br />
When Brandon woke back up he was laying in his bed. His face felt sore, no, sore didn&#39;t begin to describe it. It felt like a car hit his face. <br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s voice came from another room. &quot;Yeah, thanks for the info, doc. I promise I&#39;ll take care of him.&quot; He then walked into the room, dressed in some of Brandon&#39;s old shorts and a tank top. He was a little pleased to see a bruise on Jake&#39;s face despite the calm expression. Even though he knew he probably looked worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing your doc left a note in with those vials. He gave me a run down. Said what a second might do to you.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Not gonna let you do it, man. This is you now, you gotta learn to deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you. You&#39;ve known me what? A day?&quot; Brandon sat up in bed, he balled his fist and slugged the mattress. Then he felt strong arms wrapping around him, pulling him close. His face buried between the two furry, blond masses that made up Jake&#39;s chest. He wanted to scream and punch, but the embrace actually calmed him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you didn&#39;t punch me again.&quot; Jake said. &quot;Not sure I could lay you out again, whatever you took did a number on you while you were out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What..?&quot; Brandon pulled back and looked down at himself. He did look bulkier, and black hair had grown out along his chest again. He pushed out of his bed and scrambled over to the closest mirror. He still looked young.. really young. But the muscle and hair at least gave him some look of maturity, but he&#39;d bet that vial still hadn&#39;t aged him over 18. Staring at that face he couldn&#39;t even see his old self anymore, and not just because of the bruise that colored one side of his face. There was nothing left. Tanner skin, darker hair, even his features were all off. He was a damn good looking guy, but it wasn&#39;t him anymore.<br />
<br />
Jake appeared behind him, arms crossed. He didn&#39;t tower over Brandon quite the way he had when Brandon got back, but between the two he was still the bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me the vials, I need to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake just shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said give me the fucking vials!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn&#39;t have them anymore.&quot; Came another voice from the door. Brandon spun around to see Jannes standing in the doorway, box under his arm. Brandon took a step towards Jannes, only to find himself held back by Jake. &quot;You&#39;re out of control, Brandon. This is for your own good. I can try to figure out more about the serum, but you&#39;ll need to be patient. At least you&#39;re cancer free, and you have decades ahead of you still. You have all the time you needed now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what am I supposed to do while you fuck around trying to figure out how to fix me?&quot; Brandon tried to lunge forward again, but Jake held him in a vie like grip. He could feel the other man straining to hold him back, at least knowing some of his strength was back helped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. You&#39;re 18 again, maybe go back to college? Hook up with your new boyfriend here? I don&#39;t care. But you need to let me work on this. Or..&quot; Jannes pulled a vial out of his pocket and placed it down on the dresser with an injector. &quot;That&#39;s another option. Another dose. Sure, as young as you are now it&#39;ll revert you completely into childhood, but it will leave you so young your memories can&#39;t be retained. A completely fresh start if you really can&#39;t live like this. I&#39;ll be in touch.&quot; Jannes walked out of the room, and it wasn&#39;t until the sound of a car pulling out of the driveway reached the bedroom that Jake finally let him go.<br />
<br />
Brandon slumped down onto the bed. &quot;Fuck. My one ex always said karma would bite me in the ass one day.&quot; Jake sat down next to his and wrapped an arm over his shoulders. Brandon winced as the touch made his cock spring to life again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, like I was saying when you got back. I think we can make a go of this.&quot; Brandon felt Jake&#39;s hand wrapping around his cock, lips pressing against his neck. It took all the willpower he had to push Jake away, and luckily the bigger guy didn&#39;t put up any resistance.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Can you.. give me a bit? I need to think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll be in the other room. Don&#39;t take too long.&quot; Jake stood up and headed out of the bedroom, leaving Brandon alone with his thoughts, and the vial.</p>
