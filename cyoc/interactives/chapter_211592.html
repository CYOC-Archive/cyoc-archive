<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Poroguy for helping with this one</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Y-you can’t treat me like this!” Jeff shouted. “I’m not some dumb fucking dog!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters opened his mouth to respond when the machine beeped.<br />
<br />
There was a click and whir from the machine, along with a steadily building hum as something inside of it powered up. Jeff waited with baited breath, wondering what the machine would do. Even Mr. Walters was eyeing the machine, a slight frown on his face. Had his Principal wanted him to get defaulted?!<br />
<br />
“Species selected!’ A cheery voice pinged from the machine. “Fucking. Dog.”<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed in terror. How could this be possible? It was only supposed to select occupations!<br />
<br />
“New stats:…” The machine continued. “Horny, German Shepherd, Dumb, Police Dog.”<br />
<br />
“Ouch!” Mr. Walters laughed. “ It takes things like occupation and description very seriously. Shoulda just kept quiet and defaulted. You’d have at least been human, pal. Have a nice molding.”<br />
<br />
“Wait! Let me go! I can miss the bus, I don’t wanna be a dog!” Jeff pleaded as Mr. Walters made his way to the door.<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters paused.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s hopes rose. Maybe Mr. Walters wasn’t a complete monster after all? No one could be that cruel!<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Mr. Walters turned and Jeff’s hope quickly sank when he saw the grin on his face. “But as it turns out, you are just some dumb fucking dog!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters was still laughing as he left the room.  <br />
<br />
Jeff heard the door lock. His heart pounded in terror as he heard the humming noise within the machine begin to build, the barrel of what looked like a laser attached to a robotic arm on the machine swiveling and pointing at his head.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggled in the restraints. They were only Velcro, but they were surprisingly tight and difficult to escape from. He tugged and tugged, hearing the machine above him powering up. Across the room was a sink with a metal paper towel dispense. He could see the machine’s LED display in the reflection and saw it counting down. <br />
<br />
59…58…57…<br />
<br />
He cursed and tugged harder. Jeff shot a quick glance at the countdown, noticing the humming grow louder. 49…48…47...He yanked and yanked and heard something give. The Velcro strap felt much looser now. Jeff checked and noticed the plastic ‘eye’ the Velcro had been threaded to had deformed, the plastic stretching. He clenched his teeth and pulled his arm. With a snap, the Velcro cuff came loose.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly reached over to his other arm and undid the strap. He got to his feet and went to the door. Locked. He glanced at the LED. 14…13…12…Shit! No time.<br />
<br />
He looked around frantically for someplace to hide. The room was mostly empty save for the machine with the laser barrel, which was still targeting him in spite of his escape. Maybe rip off the metal towel dispenser, deflect the laser? No, that wouldn’t work, it was screwed to the wall.<br />
<br />
The humming was building to a crescendo. Jeff’s eyes fell on the one thing in the room big enough for him to hide behind…..the chair he’d been strapped to!<br />
<br />
3..2…1…<br />
<br />
Jeff dove behind the chair just as the beam fired. It was red and warm where it caught the top of his head. Jeff knelt close behind the chair, pressing himself to it so the beam had no target. The tingling receded the moment he was out of the beam’s sight. With a shaking hand, he reached up and found his hair thicker and softer at the top of his head where the beam hit him.<br />
<br />
Thinking it still had him targeted, the beam hit the chair and the leather started growing warm, warping as the transformative ray did its work.<br />
<br />
Fur sprouted across the leather, the shape, the headrest bending forward, Triangular ears sprouting from it and a snout warping into existence. It began to shrink, forcing Jeff to crouch lower and lower as the four legs of the chair became the four legs of a large German Shepherd dog.<br />
<br />
Jeff cursed his luck as the chair changed. Out of all the things, why dog? He couldn’t even hide behind it properly now, his faced pressed against the dog’s tail as it sprouted and wagged in front of him. Warm light ran up the tip, fur floofing out. The fur brushed past his nostrils and he had to stifle a sneeze. <br />
<br />
The warm light tingled his skin, and Jeff became aware of a smell. It was like wet dog and a virile musk. His nose twitched as the light continued to bath his general area and Jeff found himself softly snuffling for the source of the alluring smell and found his nose press against the dog’s hind end. The scents were telling him something-that the dog in front of him was horny and needy and very healthy.<br />
<br />
He panted happily, nostrils flaring as he took another whiff, his cock going rigid in his pants. Warm waves were tugging at his face, pulling it forward. Jeff groaned in pleasure, his tongue lolling out. It was such a nice scent, so nice it made his mouth water. Drool dribbled from his tongue as it started to lengthen.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw the tip of his nose blackening and flaring. In shock, he shook his head and crouched lower, trying to stay out of the light. His new position kept the light off his body and allowed him to move for a brief time. He reached up and felt patches of downy fur had spread across his face from the brief contact with the machine’s laser. His nose was bigger, the texture pebbly and moist, and his mouth seemed wider.<br />
<br />
Jeff began to feel himself over again, assessing his changed body. His hands touched his face, feeling his cold wet nose. Fear entered his mind as he began to fully comprehend what had happened. The beam had changed him after barely hitting him! Not only that, but he lost himself as he was pressed against the dog’s ass. If he wasn’t careful to avoid the beam, he might actually become a full dog!<br />
<br />
That smell pervaded his nose again, smokey, musky, alluring. He looked around for the source. Then his eyes centered on the big red cock that dangled erect between the German Shepherd’s legs, dripping precum onto the tiled floor. Jeff rolled his eyes. Of course the dog would have a huge dick. The dog twitched, blinking as it came to life. Jeff stared at it, willing it to stay put and not move.<br />
<br />
“Molding Complete!’ The mechanical voice said cheerily. “Scanning for other targets!”<br />
<br />
Other targets?! Who the hell would set a dangerous machine to scan for new targets when it was done with the assigned one? It was absolutely idiotic!<br />
<br />
As the robotic arm swiveled, the muzzle of the laser sweeping across the room, the German Shepard’s ears twitched and it turned its head. Jeff and the dog’s eyes met. The German Shepard&#39;s tail began to wag.<br />
<br />
“Stay!” Jeff whispered as sharply as he could.<br />
<br />
The dog whined, turning and sniffing Jeff’s face. <br />
<br />
Jeff let the dog’s breath wash over him. It had never been fed, so the breath was oddly fresh and moist as it blew across the nascent fur on his disfigured face. He wanted to pet it, reassure the animal, but the robotic arm had swiveled back towards them, so he had to stay still while it passed.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, boy.” Jeff whispered. “It’s okay.”<br />
<br />
The dog continued sniffing him, lapping at Jeff’s face.  Jeff could practically feel the machine’s cold, mechanical gaze on him. He kept completely still. Then the big German shepherd circled around him.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see the machine now, the camera, focusing down at the dog as its tail wagged and it sniffed at Jeff’s rear end. He couldn’t move. Didn’t move. Then the camera moved on, scanning another part of the room. Jeff let out a breath, still trying to stay a quiet. <br />
<br />
He felt a tug on his pants. Jeff spared a glance behind him just in time to see the dog yank harder, tearing his jeans and underwear off with a shake of his head. He shivered, his bare ass exposed to the cool air. Jeff’s heart began to pound. He glanced back up at the machine and saw the camera begin to swivel back to them.<br />
<br />
The dog began to lick his hole. Jeff stifled a yelp as the warm, moist tongue lapped softly at his pucker. He wanted to shove the dog away, but the camera was so close…Jeff clenched his teeth and quietly endured the dog’s probing licks, even when he felt his clenched ring part and that warm tongue entered him. <br />
<br />
He let out a breath and tried to relax as the dog continued thoroughly cleaning him out. It may have been a mistake, as the tongue entered him over and over. His cock remained inexplicably hard, though that may have something to do with the musky scent that was pervading the air.<br />
<br />
The camera refocused on them just as the big dog raised himself up and mounted Jeff. <br />
<br />
Jeff tried to stay quiet as the dog’s forepaws wrapped around his waist. He didn’t dare move under that mechanical gaze. The German Shephard thrust unsuccessfully a few times, his hot cock stabbing Jeff’s taint and sliding away. He let out a quiet sigh of relief. It was weird-shaped, it probably wouldn’t fit anyways-<br />
<br />
With his next thrust, the big dog scored a direct hit. Jeff wheezed in pain and discomfort as the cock entered him, spearing his hole. Instead of pulling back, the dog adjusted itself on Jeff’s back, forelegs squeezing him tight, and thrust deeper.<br />
<br />
Jeff bit back a groan of pain as the cock spread him wide. He wanted nothing more than to shove the dog off of him. Jeff glanced up at the machine and saw that it was still focusing on them. As the dog panted and huffed, pressing more deeply, Jeff winced and prayed for the camera to move away or go into standby mode.<br />
<br />
The dog pulled back.<br />
<br />
Jeff braced himself but the ensuing thrust knocked the breath out of him. The saliva slicking his hole helped a bit, but the dog was simply too big. He swore he could feel something tear, a bright burst of pain making him jump a little.<br />
<br />
There was a whirring noise and Jeff saw the camera focusing on his. He bit hit lip as the dog pulled out again. Jeff knew now that the only way he was escaping as a human was to let the dog fuck him-and to be absolutely quiet and still. He sobbed silently as the dog thrust again and again. The pain grew and grew. <br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t take it anymore, he had to do something. <br />
<br />
When the dog pulled out, readying another thrust, Jeff bucked, trying to flip the dog off of him. There was another click and whir from the machine overhead, a humming noise building. Jeff scrabbled at the dog’s forelegs, trying to wrench himself free.<br />
<br />
“New Target Acquired!” The mechanical voice announced cheerfully. “Commencing molding!”<br />
<br />
“No you don’t!” Jeff cried, whirling around on his knees.<br />
<br />
The dog was dragged after him-just as Jeff was hoping. Let the dog hump him if it wants, let the machine attempt to transform him. The big dog’s body was perfect cover against the ruby red ray!<br />
<br />
Jeff stayed still as the red light played over their forms. The German Shepard&#39;s warm tongue lapped against the base of his neck. It thrust again, finding its mark, and Jeff tried to relax. A gentle, tingly warmth engulfed his pucker. Jeff moaned as his hole stretched wider somehow, the big red cock sliding in easily, filling him up.<br />
<br />
The pain began to wash away, replaced with a soothing warmth. It was still uncomfortable, but not physically painful, like being fucked with a shard of glass like before. The German Shepherd’s warm licks moved up to his ears. They tickled under the long, loving strokes, the tongue tugging them up and up, and Jeff felt that they were somehow higher on his head.<br />
<br />
That pleasant warmth and gentle tingles lingered a bit longer. The German Shephard shifted again on top of him, the thrusts smoother and deeper, bumping against something that made Jeff moan in pleasure. His nose flared, picking up that delicious musky odor they dog gave off. Jeff’s mouth opened, tongue lolling out involuntarily as he began to pant happily.<br />
<br />
It all felt so good. Jeff relaxed more, arching his back so the dog could get better access. He wanted to be good for his mate, submissive and obedient. The tongue on his ears moved to the back of his head. His cock dripped precum onto the floor, so hard and hot. The licks gently soothed away the pain and fear in his mind. Jeff whimpered in pleasure as his mate claimed him-<br />
<br />
The German Shephard lay its head over Jeff’s shoulder as the gentle laps at the back of his head continued.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes went wide. He glanced from the dog, which whimpered full throatedly next to him, and then behind him. The beam’s red gaze beat down on the back of his head. He shifted in place, rolling his shoulders, trying to get the dog to lift its head and block the beam. The dog moved around, still thrusting. Jeff tried to duck his head, get out of the beam, but the dog seemed content with using his shoulder as a headrest.<br />
<br />
“G-get off me, boy!” Jeff cried.<br />
<br />
The dog didn’t respond, just thrust a little harder, a little deeper. Jeff couldn’t believe what was happening. He was being fucked by a chair that turned into a dog! How could any of this real?! He desperately needed to get the dog off him immediately. He tried moving the dog’s arms but it gripped him tighter. It was a hot spear of spear of pleasure now, the dog’s hips a blur. His ass felt so warm, the discomfort a distant memory. Jeff felt good, but he couldn’t give in, he needed the dog to stop.<br />
<br />
“Pleathe..” Jeff groaned, his tongue lolling out, looking at the dog. “Thtop it!”<br />
<br />
The German Shephard whined and licked Jeff’s face. Jeff opened his mouth to protest, but the dog’s tongue invaded it. He wanted to stop it, he knew that none of this was right, but the Shepard&#39;s hips bucked, bumping that sweet spot inside of him. The warm gentle licks on the back of his head grew in intensity. Jeff licked the dog back, enjoying his taste, his virile scent.<br />
<br />
As though to reward him, the cock inside of Jeff seemed to swell even larger, making his ring stretch pleasantly. Jeff was growing tired of fighting, all he wanted to do was let the dog fuck him, revel in the pleasure. The dog began to shift, dragging Jeff to the side, exposing the rest of his body to the beam.<br />
<br />
The beam swept gently across his body and the ruins of his clothes disintegrated. It moved down to his back legs and Jeff felt his knees pop and reverse, the heels rising, pulled upwards, until he was standing on his pads.  The German Shephard had even better access now. Something large was bumping against his rear end.<br />
<br />
As the beam pulled away, Jeff felt his spine pop and pull away with it, fur floofing out into a proper waggly tail. He wagged it as much as he could, the pleasant feelings spreading as a brown fur coat with a darker saddled began to cover his body. That bump at the base of the dog’s cock kept slamming into his pucker. Jeff could feel it begin to stretch.<br />
<br />
Whatever pain that might bring was washed away in a wave of pleasant tingles. Jeff stopped lapping at the other dog’s muzzle as he basked in the fuzzy warmth, just enjoying the feelings. He felt the beam play along his arms, watching them shift bemusedly into front legs. It all felt so nice, he was feeling so full and warm.<br />
<br />
The German Shephard growled and thrust hard. Jeff gasped as the knot blew his hole wide open and wedged itself in his hole. For a brief moment, it felt painful. Then the beam played across his face and it felt perfect and warm and tingly, like it was meant to be there. Jeff felt the warmth pulling his face forward.<br />
<br />
A few gentle tugs was all it took for his nose and mouth to form into  a proper muzzle. His mind whirred as he inhaled new scents, even deeper and more complex than just the smell of two horny dogs fucking. The warmth gently guided his thoughts towards when he was born. He remembered the bitch who whelped him, nursed him at her teat. Jeff tried to shake the thought away, but the warmth was so nice and soothing that he could only relax and let the memory settle in deep, his childhood beginning to change.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jeff gained a second wind. He came to his senses, pushing back against these fake memories. No, this wasn’t right at all! He had to fight it. He couldn’t let the memories in otherwise he would never be able to become human again. Jeff tried to focus on something that would tie him to reality, something that would keep him sane. He repeated his own name over and over again… Jeff… Jeff… Jeff…<br />
<br />
Warmth soothed his thoughts, gently pushing them again, and Jet remembered being picked up by a nice man who smelled good and cradled the puppy in his arms. Something about that seemed wrong to him somehow, but Jet didn’t mind. Jet’s eyes began to glaze as more memories poured in, the black-furred German Shephard losing itself completely in the warm, gentle waves and tingles of his memories.<br />
<br />
The German Shephard on top of him gave one final buck and yowled, his huge cock gushing hot white seed into Jet’s tight hole. The waves of pleasure increased as Jet went through academy training, one of the dumbest dogs on the force, but somehow managed to pull it off and become a proper police dog.<br />
<br />
One final, coaxing wave of warmth echoed through his collapsed skull. Jet whined and came hard onto the office floor. The light shut off and the machine whirred and clicked off, entering sleep mode.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“Well, ready for your first day on the force, officer Barkins?” Mr. Walters chuckled as he walked into the room.<br />
<br />
He paused, shocked, as two dogs swiveled their heads in his direction. Where had the other dog come from? Was it a student? Or maybe-<br />
<br />
His eyes fell on the space where the chair should have been. Nearby, a broken Velcro strap lay on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Thought you could trick it, huh?” Mr Walters laughed and walked over to the dogs where they lay perfectly still beneath the machine. “Looks like you two are going to be perfect for whoever I hire to be the new security guard.”<br />
<br />
“Accepted!” The machine said cheerfully, whirring to life. A hum began to build. “Occupation: Security Guard! Enjoy your molding!”<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Mr. Walters held up a hand. “Stop! Voice command: Cancel!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, but I’m afraid I cannot halt an operation while it is in progress,” The machine said cheerfully. “Please wait until the operation is finished.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters turned to run.<br />
<br />
A red light enveloped him.</p>
