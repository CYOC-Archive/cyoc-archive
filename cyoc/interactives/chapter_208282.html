<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The flicker of doubt in your mind is quickly extinguished when you watch the creature’s eyes suddenly widen, “Honey, is that you!?” she says incredulously, her voice now much lower and sultry than before. You dumbfoundedly nod your head, “Oh my god, you’re so hot! You look like you were born to be an action star! How did this happen!?” your girlfriend blurts out as she starts to sit up, clearly not even having noticed her own changes in her surprise, though the undulating canyon on her chest certainly does not escape your notice as she begins to move. Your mind is briefly sent spinning as you process the incredulousness of quite possibly the most beautiful woman you have ever seen, who sounds like they work for a sex phoneline rather than your girlfriend, gushing about how hot you are. <br />
<br />
You let out an awkward cough, “Um…speak for yourself babe, I’m pretty sure not even a born action star is in your league anymore.” Your girlfriend gave you a quizzical look, or at least you assumed and hoped that is what she was trying to do based on experience, with her new features the change in expression looked more like she was regarding dirt that had the audacity to question her. “What do you mean…” she trailed off as she finally looked down and took in her form, or what she could at least, the new twins immediately taking up most of her view “OH MY GOD! ARE THESE MINE!??”, she yelped and immediately reached up for a physical inspection, an instant moan escaping her lips as she press her fingers into the pliant flesh. “Holy shit, these are sensitive” she murmured, momentarily distracted, not that you could complain, watching this dark goddess feel herself up in front of you. You couldn’t help but notice however, that apparently your girlfriend’s hands had some changes as well, the digits clearly now longer and more slender, but it was the nails that gave you pause, now pitch-black as if with permanent nail polish and going to wicked points, you’d have to be careful around those.<br />
<br />
Seemingly satisfied with the inspection of her new fruit stand, you were broken out of your thoughts by your girlfriend starting to stand up as she started going off again “This is crazy, did those costumes really do this? I’d like to see anyone call these pancakes anymore. How long do you think this will last? I just can’t wait…LOOK AT MY ASS!” Your girlfriend’s stream of consciousness broken by the discovery of her new derriere. It didn’t escape you that in her outfit’s heels your girlfriend now stood a few inches than even your new 6’4” height but, that was quickly eclipsed by her new backside. And what a backside it was, a textbook bubble butt, you imagine you could easily bounce a quarter off that thing. Finding yourself mesmerized by the sight you didn’t even realize you had zoned out until your girlfriend let out a “HEY!” startling you out of your stupor. Your girlfriend gave you a wicked grin, the expression on her new face again giving the impression a predator about to feast, rather than the playful look she was clearly going for, “aww, is the big bad hunter distracted by little old me?” she said, sounding more like a biting taunt than playful quip, as if a lightbulb had finally gone off, you watched as your girlfriend’s eyes widened like saucers, “Is that my voice? Holy shit it sounds so sensual, so dark, so sexy!” “You’re just now noticing? You sound as if your as likely to kill me where I stand as you are to rip my close off and fuck.” You reply with a chuckle. “Mmmm…that second idea doesn’t sound too bad...big man.” She breathily says as she approaches you and leans achingly close to your face, as you feel your newest tool begin to stir. <br />
<br />
As her lips get closer and closer to your own, your girlfriend suddenly pulls away letting loose a giggle sounding like it was designed for ridicule. “But first! I’ve got to see this face! Let’s hope this magic costume didn’t ruin mirrors for me.” You sigh, though don’t miss the opportunity to watch that spectacular ass in motion, following your girlfriend over to large mirror in the corner of the room above your dresser. You noticed two things immediately, first your girlfriend wasn’t kidding about your looks, if you didn’t know it was you, you would have been incredibly jealous of this man being around your girlfriend (especially in her current appearance) and, second your girlfriend was in fact completely absent from the mirror in front of you. “Oh, come on! I just want to see what I look like, is that so much to ask?” she said in exasperation, almost as if on command, the ruby choker on your girlfriend’s neck suddenly flashed, and in the mirror appeared your girlfriend in all her dark glory.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck…” she muttered to herself as she took in her features, “Wow I wondered what it would be like to have resting bitch face but this is a whole other level” you let out a snort at that, “I wasn’t going say it” she gave you flat look, which sent chills down your spine, changing to that predatory grin when she saw your reaction, which faltered when she saw her reflection of it, “See! I don’t think this face is capable of a ‘nice’ or ‘innocent’ expression.” As if to prove her point, your girlfriend started shifting her face through a number of different expressions none of which could ever be mistaken for ‘nice’ and certainly not ‘innocent’. Her scowl, an expression promising immense pain, in particular made you want to run out of the room in fear, the knowledge that you were at least three times your usual size the only thing keeping you from doing so.<br />
<br />
Breaking free from her experimentation, your girlfriend looked over at you giving you her now trademark predatory grin, fangs on full display. “Aw, sorry hunter, I didn’t realize how scary I was to you mortals, even ones as big and strong as you, you came all the way to my lair and you deserve a reward” your girlfriend stepped forward and pressed her pillowy lips against yours, you almost melted immediately and began to reciprocate until you felt a sharp pain in your mouth and watched your vampiric girlfriend pull away, licking up a tell-tale red smear, “What the fuck!?” you exclaim giving your girlfriend a scowl, “mmm sorry hunter, you have to be more careful than that, over course I had to have a taste” she said with a wink. “Now what to do next I wonder…” as her red predatory eyes lock with yours.</p>
