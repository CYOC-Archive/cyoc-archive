<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at the costume in your hand, a smirk finds its way way onto your face. It's a sexy cabaret outfit complete with bunny ears. Of course, you're a guy, but you've always been a joker. This is right in line with your bizarre sense of humor, and you've embarrassed yourself plenty of times just to get a laugh out of your friends. In other words, this is the perfect costume for the party!<br />
<br />
As you bring the outfit to the register, the girl smiles slyly back at you. &quot;We usually recommend that outfit for girls who need to be more... 'outgoing.'&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I'm going to a party with some friends and I figure it will be good for a laugh.&quot;<br />
She continued smiling, &quot;I'm sure it will, how about some shoes to match?&quot; She pointed behind herself, where there were some shelves with costume accessories. &quot;They're not included, but if you buy a pair here, I can find a set that matches, even the fit... no matter what.&quot;<br />
You nod, and she rings it up. It seemed a little expensive, but since you already decided you'd wear it and you weren't really in need of money, you don't pay that much mind. You put your items in a bag and go on your way.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
A few days later, you pull the costume out of the bag; there is a red, velvet suit with stockings and a little puff-ball tail, matching gloves, a white collar, and a pair of bunny ears. You briefly muse on how great a girl would look in it, especially a hot one... if the assistant at the store was right, it would be skin-tight and perfect on anyone... in fact, you started to imagine her filling in the curves, but shake it out of your head. It's going to be a tight fit in the crotch as it is, without those kinds of thoughts. You slip into the stockings and the main outfit. It feels... oddly tingly, sliding over your skin, not like anything you'd felt before. There must have been something unique about the material of the stockings, because somehow, they do indeed fit perfectly, even over your masculine and hairy legs. You continue by lifting and zipping up the top half of the costume. Again, there's a slight tingle, and you look in the mirror, half expecting to be transforming, only to find... you look absolutely ridiculous. You look like a half-assed transvestite, but at least the clothes are surprisingly comfortable. Besides, that's what you're going for. You put on the gloves and shoes - actually boots that up halfway to your knee - with the same glossy red appearance. Finally, the collar. You only look more like some drag queen... perfect! You pick up the headband with the bunny ears, and grab a long jacket so you don't get cold (or stopped by the cops) on the way there.<br />
<br />
Once you reach the party, you realize it's a huge deal. You only have a few friends coming, and it's a big house, and packed. However, there are all sorts of bizarre and outrageous costumes, so you don't feel too out of place. The booming music drowns out most ambient conversation, and you can hardly hear yourself think. None the less, you quickly find your friend, John, dressed as some kind of cat-boy and shed the jacket. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
He laughs loudly, even over the booming music. &quot;You're a madman, I tell you. I'm going to look for Sarah and June, they're here too and they've got to see this.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, wait! I almost forgot...&quot; you add the bunny-ears headband and strange sensation runs through your body, like the tingling from before, but across all your skin. You shudder for a moment in reaction, but it's gone.<br />
&quot;That's great! I'll go get the girls, and I'll find you again!&quot;<br />
After he leaves, you wander around a few rooms and mingle. You get a few questions about the suit, but laugh them all off. After a while, everyone seems to have noticed it and gotten used to it, as the questions stop. You still get stares everywhere you go, however. Being a social person, you enjoy talking to different people, boys and girls, and making an impression. You give some joke winks and blown kisses to guys looking at your costume incredulously. You move from room to room, continually changing crowds, but the odd thing is, as the night goes on, the reactions seem to change. At first, the girls were the more entertained by your stunt, and you used it as an ice-breaker for some friendly flirting (it's been a while since you had some real action anyway). But as the night goes on, their looks become less entertained, and looks of disdain. On the other hand, the boys go from disinterested, to, well, very interested, yet this is about the same time they stop asking why you would wear it. For that matter, you find yourself no longer flirting with the girls, and talking almost exclusively with the guys. At least everyone at the party is friendly, you think, winking at another guy as he hands you a drink. That's another thing, they're all a lot more likely to play along with your play-flirting than they were before.<br />
<br />
The costume itself is feeling more and more comfortable, and you almost forget you're wearing it, as you've almost forgotten that John was going to be looking for you. That is odd, you think, he saw you quickly before, and you certainly stand out, why hasn't he found you again? You brush the thought aside as you down another drink - more than you would normally drink, even at a party. You're definitely feeling a bit light-headed, and when the guy sitting next to you puts an arm around your shoulder, you lean into him and smile as he tells you about the amateur movies he makes... such an interesting guy, not half bad looking either. Something about that thought seems odd, and you try to stand up, a little wobbly.<br />
'There's nothing wrong with appreciating another guy's looks', you tell yourself, 'I've been checking them out all night. Wait, I have?'<br />
Still feeling light-headed, you push the guy in question away as you walk in the other direction to clear your head - the alcohol is definitely getting to you. You go down a much less crowded hall, then finally into an empty bedroom. You close the door and turn on a desk lamp. In the dim lighting you turn and see that the room isn't empty - a really hot girl is standing in front of you, looking back at you, with the exact same shocked expression you have. Then it dawns on you... that's a mirror!<br />
You're a girl! A really HOT girl at that! Just like you had imagined before... the costume is filled out in the ideal shapes. The chest and but curve smoothly and naturally, the legs are the finest you've ever seen, and even your face, in shock, is still somehow sultry and sexy - and most definitely feminine. It looks like you're even wearing lipstick. Even your boots somehow gained high heels without your noticing, completing the seductive outfit. You grab at your breasts, and feel the ample, soft flesh underneath the velvet cups. They feel as real and natural as possible, as impossible as that seems. You find yourself getting turned on, and feel between your legs, but there's nothing there - no bulge, or the hardness you'd expect from the familiar hotness you're feeling in your body, partly from the drinking and partly from seeing and feeling yourself. You sit on the nearby bed to catch your breath and calm yourself down. Then, in disbelief, you unzip your top, and pull down the front. There are two round and somewhat - though not comically - large breasts, staring at you from the mirror. You feel them again, and unbidden your fingers trace a circle around each nipple. Again, the hot feeling returns, spreading throughout your body from your nipples. You forcefully stop yourself, and in the mirror notice the only thing bizarre enough to make you forget that feeling entirely. Your ears moved! Now you try to flex your ears on the sides of your head, and the bunny-ears twitch instead! Thinking they could not possibly become real, you snatch at your headband, pulling off the human ears you had though were real with it, leaving the tall, white, furry ones. There is a label with lots of small writing on the bottom of the headband. Thinking back, you think it was there before, but you didn't bother to read it or examine it because you wanted to get to the party. But now you have to find out if there's any explanation for what's happened to you!</p>
