<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sleep; a chance for the body to recuperate and the subconscious to work out problems. While Peter’s body was busy knitting itself back together after being shot, his mind was alight with synapsis and neurons firing. Peter was dreaming, but it was a dream he dreaded seeing again.<br />
<br />
Watching as he was being shot by the man that stole his 66 mustang. The bullet once again, penetrates his abdomen causing Peter to crumple to the ground.<br />
“Welcome back.”<br />
Peter reels around to see the strange man once again with his smile. A smile that un-nerved Peter; as the individual walks through the image of Peter being shot. The dream shifting to the hospital room Peter was lying in.<br />
“You again,” Peter growling; “how dare you come back, how dare you accuse me of being gay!”<br />
“Well I can’t exactly give you a swift kick in the ass,” The draconic man chuckling; “it wouldn’t have had the desired oomph to have you fight for your life. Saying you are a gay when you are not, worked.”<br />
“What are you getting on about,” Peter snarling; “I have little patience for riddles and tricks. I had my fill of those from Jean.”<br />
“You died,” the draconic man looking serious; “twice, on the way to the hospital. I had a hell of a time keeping you from crossing over; hence the accusation. It put the drive in you to fight back as it were.”<br />
“Are you a god,” Peter looking at the man.<br />
“While I do have abilities that make me god like, I make no claims of being one,” the man responding; “I act more of a guide, helping those that need me the most. Walk with me Peter,” the man speaking; “that way we can talk for a bit.”<br />
“Do I have a choice in the matter,” Peter grumbling.<br />
“Actually,” the man looking at the were-lion; “you do. But I’d prefer you don’t act like a stubborn ass like Julie Stovall did months ago.”<br />
<br />
Peter sighing he has nothing better to do then lying in a bed; he gets up to see the wound on his gut gone; looking at the draconic man, he smiles as he leads Peter on.<br />
“You’re dreaming,” the man speaking; “chances are you are moaning or mumbling in your sleep.”<br />
“So I dreamt that form of yours earlier,” Peter responding.<br />
“Nope,” the man grinning; “that was real. I am one of the last of my kind sadly.”<br />
“What are you really,” Peter asking; “are you a were?”<br />
“Yes and no,” the man answering; “I am something old. Something that came before; but that is not why I’m here.”<br />
“Then why are you here,” Peter seeing the man stop at what looked like the maternity ward; never being in this part of the hospital, Peter can’t be too sure.<br />
“Look,” the man gesturing Peter forward.<br />
<br />
Approaching the glass wall, Peter could see row upon row of new born babies sleeping in the maternity ward. At the other end of the room another glass wall could be seen with an older looking Peter Talbot smiling as a nurse holds up a baby for him to see. Unable to tell if the child is a boy or a girl, Peter turns back to the man.<br />
“You will be a father one day,” the man answering; “when I cannot say. But I do know this,” the man looking at Peter; “like Evan Lawson’s new born son, your child will be a hybrid were. Don’t look to the were-lionesses for a mate Peter,” the draconic man looking at confused man; “you will not find one that is not interested in the status you have within the Pride.”<br />
“I already knew that,” Peter grousing; “next you’ll be telling me that Liv Robinson is not the one; that I already know. Tell me something that I don’t know.”<br />
“This is the century for hybrids,” the draconic man grins; “When you’re all rested up, you might want to apologize to the were-rabbit paramedic whose arm you broken. He has a sister you might take a shine too.”<br />
“A were-rabbit mate,” Peter looking incredulous; “you have got to be kidding.”<br />
“I rarely joke,” the draconic man answering; “just think on what I said while you recover. Oh and Peter,” the man walking off; “stop griping over your sister finding her mate, be glad she found someone who will protect her and loves her for what she is. Not WHO she is.”<br />
<br />
Peter wakes up with a gasp; frightening the nurse who came in to chart his vitals as he slept.<br />
“Bad dreams,” Kyle the werecat speaking.<br />
“Something like that,” Peter answering; “It did un-nerve me.”<br />
“Well hopefully the next dream will be more pleasant,” Kyle smiling as he walks out.<br />
Peter looking as the male nurse walks out of the hospital room. Wondering if he started something earlier; Peter winces as he tries to move and make himself more comfortable before falling back into a fitful sleep.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Well that could have gone better,” Leon fuming while lying in bed; “Peter better be in a far better mood come morning. Injured or not, I won’t put up with that attitude of his.”<br />
“He is just frustrated love,” Regina lying next to her were-lion mate; “jealous that his baby sister is in a steady relationship.”<br />
“It could be more than that,” Leon sighing; “it’s not lost on me that many were-lionesses in the pride are trying to bed Peter solely because he will be the next king. And I do spoil Jean,” Leon rolling to look at his wife; “shamelessly at times.”<br />
“She is your little princess,” Regina smiling; “despite the fact that Jean is a grown woman. Father’s always have blinders on when it comes to daughters,” Regina kissing her husband; “you’ve always seen Jean as the six year old girl in the Cinderella dress for Halloween.”<br />
“And now,” Leon hearing the howling and roaring coming from Jean’s room; “she is mated with a werewolf. Why do daughters grow up so fast?”<br />
“Why do sons,” Regina placing a paw on Leon’s sheathe; “act as if they have rocks for brains?”<br />
“And why do wives,” Leon growling as he enjoys the caressing coming from Regina; “seem to know how to distract their husbands?”<br />
“It’s not that difficult,” Regina climbing on top of Leon; “touch you down there and you are putty in our paws.”<br />
<br />
Leon growls happily as he watches his wife ride up and down his steely shaft. All thoughts of his children fade from his mind as the pleasure of being ridden and mated drives him to orgasmic bliss.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Jean Talbot’s room; Nate Anderson and Jean picked up right where they left off after Sheriff Cooper paid the house an unexpected visit. Despite Peter Talbot being shot and recovering in the hospital. Such a tragic incident could not prevent the two lover’s from rutting as mates tend to do. With Nate’s lupine shaft locked in Jean’s hungry snatch; the werewolf and were-lioness each below out their climaxes as each reach their crescendo. Nate panting as his shaft shoots out his seed, eagerly being drunk by Jean’s sex. Her purring and growling as Nate is mounted on top of her as he stays on top; enjoying the afterglow of their recent mating session.<br />
“You still want to go until we pass out,” Nate sighing in contentment.<br />
“If it takes all night,” Jean purring; “then my husband, keep rutting me.”<br />
“Husband,” Nate smiling; “that is a word that will take some getting use to.”<br />
“We are married in the eyes of nature Nate,” Jean starting to grind her hips; “it’s only a matter of time before we make it official in the eyes of the law”<br />
“Then brace yourself Jean Anderson,” Nate chuckling; “I’m about to claim you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jean closed her eyes and smiled, as Nate stared thrusting and slapping his furry balls on her crotch. ‘Jean Anderson,’ she thinks; ‘has a nice ring to it.’<br />
“I can’t wait to tell your parents,” Jean panting as she revels in the multiple orgasms Nate is giving her; “they are going to be surprised.”<br />
“Shall we start looking for an apartment to live in,” Nate thrusting; feeling his knot getting bigger as the sound of his lupine rod slides in and out of Jean’s canal; “or just shack up in my room?”<br />
“You still have school to finish,” Jean feeling the knot stretch her sex to the limit; “let’s just… ooooh… hold off on the whole moving out for a bit.”<br />
“So here and my place then,” Nate panting as he can feel his balls clenching as a fresh batch of baby batter starts traveling up his shaft; “works for me, cause I’m about to blow!”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Jean roaring. Feeling the warm seed spill in her; her own body shuddering as her orgasm rocks her body; “that feels great!”<br />
<br />
The combine release was too much for the happy couple; collapsing on the bed in bliss. Both Nate and Jean slowly hear Leon and Regina roar proudly as each reaches their climax. Jean smiles as she is lovingly enveloped by her werewolf mate; slowly drifting off to sleep as Nate rests his chin on her shoulder, unable to stop smiling as he falls asleep in complete peace.</p>
