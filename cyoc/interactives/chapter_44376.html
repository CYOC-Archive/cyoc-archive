<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There's a knock on the door and without thinking you go over and open it up. Megan is standing there dressed in her own night clothes which was a light pink and white shirt that came down to just above her knees. She doesn't say anything about you wearing night clothes but instead says &quot;It's almost time for breakfast. I'm sure you need to use the toilet so hurry up and use it already. We don't want to be ate for breakfast. I don't want to mention the punishment for such.&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought it weird that Megan didn't want to mention the punishment for being late to breakfast. You would have asked her but the anxious look on her face told you that she was really worried about it. So instead you turn around and go to the guest bath. Inside you pull up the nightgown and slip your hand into the panties to pull your dick out. Instead of feeling your dick you feel only flat skin. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; you shout as you pull down the panties to have a closer look. Sure enough your eyes confirm what your hand already told you.<br />
<br />
Starting to panic you jump when Megan says &quot;You'll have to sit to use the toilet from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to my dick?&quot; you asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madame Morphia removed it last night&quot; she said with her head lowered a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that was only a dream&quot; you said in total bewilderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but it wasn't a dream&quot; she said looking down at the floor. &quot;Now if you don't hurry we will be late for breakfast. Madame Morphia is a real stickler for being on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing you turn around and sit down on the toilet. It felt strange to be doing this as you were used to standing up to pee. When you're finished Megan tells you to wipe and that you will need to get used to doing that. After washing your hands at Megan's insistence the two of you leave the guest room. On the way down to breakfast you ask &quot;How did this happen to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madame Morphia will tell you that herself&quot; Megan said and then remained silent for the rest of the trip to the dining room.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the dining room you find a pretty large table with about sixteen girls ranging in age from about six to about sixteen and all in their nightclothes except for Madame Morphia. Madame Morphia looks up and says &quot;You two have cut it very close. Now sit down so we can begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan sat down at one of the two empty chairs that were left at the table which was on Madame Morphia's right. That left you with the chair on Madame Morphia's left. Sitting down in the chair bands suddenly wrapped around your chest and legs keeping you in the chair. Madame Morphia clapped her hands and demons came through a door bearing trays. You screamed when you saw them and tried to get up out of the chair but it was no use. The bands held you tight and you couldn't get away. &quot;Now don't be frightened child&quot; Madame Morphia said as a demon set a plate of food in front of you. &quot;These demons are under my command and will not harm you unless they wish to be punished.&quot; At those words each of the demons cringed and were clearly very afraid of the punishment they would receive should they harm you. You calm down a bit as Madame Morphia continues. &quot;I'm sure you have figured out what I am by now. In case you haven't though I'm a demon myself. Now I'm sure you're wondering what I do. I help people to have children. There are so many that are willing to sell their souls to me to have children. Some I do accept the offer of their souls though those are the cases that require me to fudge with memories since those don't want to go through pregnancy, giving birth, and raising a baby. Those that do want to do that I come up with other payments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what kind of payments?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it might be sexual favors or maybe an offering of roses and cinnamon&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Depends on the mood I'm in.&quot; Turning to Megan she asked &quot;Now Megan, would you like a younger sister or should I place her in another family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't place me with another family!&quot; you shout. &quot;I already have family and friends who will wonder where I went!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning back to you Madame Morphia said &quot;I choose who I take very carefully. Your parents died five years ago and your only friend is Dan. He will worry about you and look for you when the police find your abandoned car. Though he'll be joining us soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my girlfriend?&quot; you asked trying to come up with something. &quot;Neither her nor her family will stop looking for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now child&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;I just told you that I choose who I take very carefully. You are thirty-five years old and still you can not see that your girlfriend has been cheating on you. Her family knows this and condones it. The guy she's seeing now is submissive and does what she wants him to do. Oh her and her family will go through the motions of being worried about you and looking for you until Dan joins us here. After that they couldn't care less.&quot; Turing back to Megan she repeated her question. &quot;Now Megan, would you like a younger sister or should I place her in another family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan looked at Madame Morphia and said &quot;I would like to have a younger sister Madame Morphia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then Mr. Rick will be your younger sister&quot; Madame Morphia said with a smile. Then with a thoughtful look on her face she said &quot;Though Rick won't be a good name for a girl. I think I'll rename you... Victoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's to stop me from leaving after I get up from this chair?&quot; you asked a hint of defiance in your voice.<br />
<br />
Madame Morphia giggled and said &quot;There are two things. The first is that we are no longer on that island and you can not go beyond the boundaries of the grounds while we are in the Hell dimension. The second is I still have your penis and testicles and can crush them if you leave while we are in the Earth dimension. No matter where you go you will feel the pain and I can track you. So there is nowhere you can go Victoria. Now be a good child and eat your breakfast.&quot; Looking between you and Megan she added &quot;Megan, Victoria, you two can call me Mother now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan looked surprised by this while the other girls seemed to be disappointed. Those girls continued to eat their breakfast though without much enthusiasm. You wonder if they were all men that Madame Morphia had taken at some point. Seeming to read your mind Madame Morphia said &quot;Some of these girls were men when I took them and some where women. Megan is one of those that was a woman when I took them. Now finish eating or I will have to punish you. Sally, tell Victoria what I did to punish you when you called me a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sixteen year old girl looked down and said &quot;I called Madame Morphia a bitch one time and she turned me into one for three weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was rather nice having a little poodle running around here for that time&quot; Madame Morphia said wistfully. &quot;I was tempted to keep her that way but in the end I decided to change her back. Though the next time that happens I may not.&quot; She said this last part with a wicked grin that suggested that she would indeed leave anyone who called her a bitch again as a bitch.<br />
<br />
You decided that it would be best for you to eat so you started to. You had been served an omelet and it was the best omelet you had ever tasted. You picked up the toast and spread some jam on it and that tasted better than what you've had before. The orange juice was the same. Remembering the look of disappointment on the other girls' faces you wonder if Madame Morphia had told them that she would be choosing one of them to be her daughter. If so then each one must have been hoping that they would be selected. It must be the food they would want. You know that you would hate to go back to eating the bland food you were used to even after just one bite. You guess that there is at least one advantage to being the daughter of a demon.<br />
<br />
After everyone had finished eating Madame Morphia said &quot;Alright girls, you may go about your morning. Megan, since you and Victoria are sisters now you will be sharing a room. Please show her where that is and help her get dressed. You may pierce her ears also. After that please show her around the house and grounds. Now Victoria, lunchtime is at one o'clock. I do expect you to be on time and I do hope that I won't have to bind you to the chair before it's served.&quot; When you shake your head no she continued &quot;Ok girls, off with you.&quot; She made a shooing motion with her hands and all the girls got up and left.<br />
<br />
As Megan was leading you up to your shared room she asked &quot;Which would you like to see first? The house or the grounds?&quot;</p>
