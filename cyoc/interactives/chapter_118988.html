<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Based on previous experience, Jon should have known better. He should have gone straight to a stall and finished the job. Instead, he made a big mistake. <br />
<br />
Without taking off his shoes or his jock, Jon rushed into the shower and began to blast himself with cold water. This seemed to do the trick until the rest of his classmates came in to the locker room. As soon as the other students came in, he felt the stare of twenty pairs of eyes on his already aroused body. It was like Jon had gone into a trance. His body began to move completely on its own. For what it was worth, Karyn seemed to be getting a lot of mileage of of her wish that he would &quot;strut around and grope himself like a horndog.&quot; Jon began to slowly move his hips from side to side then, slipping his fingers below the waistband of his jock, he pulled it agonizingly slowly down so that his cock was fully exposed and his balls were pushed forward. For the most part, it was business as usual in the locker room only a few of the guys kept watching after the initial shock of seeing Jon making such a scene. &quot;They must be used to this after going to school with me for so long.&quot; Jon thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Still, there were a few, including Tom who seemed to stop what they were doing completely to watch the impromptu striptease going on in the shower. <br />
<br />
Jon finally removed his shoes but then, he went right back to his ministrations. With one hand he stroked his giant dick and with the other, he alternated between cradling his heavy balls and pinching his large nipples. Jon worked up a good rhythm and even as miserable as it was to act this way, he felt great. Then, his hands released his dick and grabbed two handfuls of his meaty and muscular ass. he traced the crack of his rear with one finger and then looped his fingers under the straps of the jock. He pulled out of the jock and discarded it. <br />
<br />
Now he was standing there on full display. He began to make a big show of lathering up with soap. Then, he heard a voice next to him say, &quot;Want me to get your back?&quot; Jon glanced over his shoulder and saw Tom standing next to him in the water erect and entranced. In his head Jon screamed &quot;NO&quot; but he said, &quot;Sure, if you want to feel a real man.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom didn&#39;t need more of an invitation than that. He began to lather Jon up from top to bottom. Jon continued to stroke and wash until he felt an extra hand grab his shaft. Tom was working him as he washed. Jon came with a groan and he felt something hot and sticky spurt on the back of his calf. <br />
<br />
He felt so dirty and used. Tom had taken advantage of the compromised condition the curse had left him in and to everyone else, Jon appeared to have been loving it. <br />
<br />
Jon and Tom both finished cleaning themselves separately and Tom got dressed and went to class. Jon was trying to figure out what to do with his wet gym jock and shoes and his cumstained shorts from earlier when the bell rang. The coach came out of his office and said, &quot;You&#39;re going to be late again. Looks like you&#39;re going to have to grab something from the lost and found.&quot; <br />
<br />
The coach reached into the old bin and pulled out a pair of old compression shorts and tossed them to Jon. Jon held them in his hands long enough for Coach Hendricks to say, &quot;They look rough but everything in this bin has been washed. Now hurry up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jon pulled on the tired looking shorts and the small holes that had been a part of the tatted looking shorts expanded so that the entirety of Jon&#39;s right cheek and a portion of his left hip and side were now visible. Jon pulled on his tiny short and his wet shoes and began to hurry on to class. <br />
<br />
The only hope in his mind was that he was seated next to Karyn in their second period Civics class and he would be able to get the stone from her there.</p>
