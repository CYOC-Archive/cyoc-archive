<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis makes his way down the first hall, passing by classrooms and offices. He walks by students and teachers, some even giving him passing glares and even a few smiles. He enters the next corridor. He sees pretty much the same thing, except this time he passes by some bathrooms and a janitors closet. He finds his locker, number 2187. He entered the code and opens the door. He takes his present out of his bag and places it in his locker, mentally reminding himself not to forget it. Then, he takes a few books from the locker and stuffs them into his bag. He lifted his arm up and looked at his...<br />
He forgot his watch.<br />
Instead, he reaches into his pocket and grabs his phone. He had about three minutes to get to his first class. The halls were looking scarce, so he knew he needed to get there quickly. He shut his locker and made sure to lock it. He looked around and saw that the halls were almost empty, aside from him and another kid he didn’t know.<br />
<br />
He walked quickly to the classroom. He had a chemistry class, which wasn’t a stressful class so he could most likely relax. He entered a new corridor and saw the door. Most of the class were already sitting down, so he hoped he wasn’t super later, otherwise he’d be in trouble.<br />
He made his way in and walked through the door. A few eyes were on him as he awkwardly walked past everyone to the middle row, where he found his usual seat.<br />
He let out a quiet sigh and sat down, resting his satchel next to his chair.<br />
<br />
“Hey Alexis,” a girl on his right said, one seat away. She looked at him, smiling at him. He didn’t talk to her that much, but he was paired with her for a group project one time. Her name was Monica. She typically hung out with a couple other girls. All of which seemed to act the same way as her to him. At one point, one of her friends, Jessica, flirted with him in the hall. After that, he always assumed they all had a thing for him.<br />
Alexis didn’t deny it, they were all pretty attractive. Monica in particular had a pretty face, long blonde hair, and a relatively curvy body. That wasn’t exactly what Alexis looked for in women, but he couldn’t deny he took the occasional glance.<br />
Alexis gave her an awkward eyebrow raise and an equally awkward smile. She giggled,<br />
“I like your watch,” she said to him.<br />
Alexis was a little surprised by this remark, lifting his left arm and not seeing a watch. Then he lifted his right arm, and on his wrist. A watch.<br />
He didn’t remember putting on a watch, thinking he’d simply just forgotten. But it seemed like he had. But he’d never put it on his right wrist before,<br />
“O-oh... uhm- thanks,” he said, awkwardly, not looking at her as he took it off and placed it on his left instead.<br />
<br />
Then, in walked a face he’d much rather see.<br />
Justin. Another member of his core bunch of friends. He was usually late, but today he actually on time.<br />
“Alex!” He said from across the room. He quickly made his way to the seat in between Alex and Monica. Monica didn’t look too happy, as she averted her gaze to her book and started scribbling something.<br />
Justin sat down and leaned over to Alexis,<br />
“Happy birthday!” He said loudly, nearly everyone hearing. Making Alexis feel a little overwhelmed,<br />
“Aah...” Alexis croaked out, “thanks, man,” he said.<br />
Justin was a very extroverted guy, opposed to Alexis’ introverted nature. As much as he was pretty confident when talking to people, he preferred hanging out with people he was comfortable with. Like his friends.<br />
“So, anything special?” He asked Alexis, “got any superpowers yet,” he joked.<br />
Alexis hesitated, suddenly remembering everything that happened, “Huh...” he said,<br />
“Everything good?” Justin asked Alexis, grabbing Alexis’ arm and shaking him slightly. Alexis snapped out of his trance,<br />
“O-oh sorry. I mean it’s fine...” he replied. He then reread everything he said and realised none of it made sense, “uhm... yeah I’m good. I’ve been a little off all morning,”<br />
“I can tell,” Justin said,<br />
“Damn...” Alexis said, “maybe it’s the superpowers kicking in,” Alexis joked, lightening the mood. Justin chuckled with him,<br />
“Maybe it is. I better be the first to know, got it,” Justin said, playing along.<br />
They both laughed and spoke some more before the teacher finally walked in. Mr Gordon was a fifty-something year old man who was clearly passionate about his work. But maybe the cards he was dealt lead him to settle as a High School Chemistry teacher.<br />
At least it was a Private School<br />
<br />
For a half hour, Alexis tried his best to focus on what they were learning. But he kept zoning out. He was distracted by the feeling. It was feeling so much different, and every time he tried to focus on something else, it got even more distracting. He was very frustrated. But as the lesson went on, the feeling changed from just annoying, to irritating, and soon changed once again. It was intense, he felt like he might even vomit. <br />
<br />
Alexis could hear some kids talking around him, but the feeling was so distracting that he couldn’t focus on what they were saying.<br />
Then he felt a poke on his arm from Justin. He lifted his head and looked at him,<br />
“Oh wow, she wasn’t wrong. Are you good?” Justin asked,<br />
“W-what...” Alexis replied, unable to say anything else,<br />
“Yo you need to go to the bathroom,” Justin said.<br />
“Mr Gordon!” Monica said loudly to get the teachers attention,<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes. Do you have a question?” Mr Gordon said,<br />
<br />
“N-no it’s...” she stuttered a little, “I think Alexis might need to leave for a moment,”<br />
<br />
“Oh dear, yes of course.” He said, placing his pen on the desk and standing up, “Justin, could you help him up?”<br />
<br />
Justin complied, helping Alexis stand up. He looked very pale, clearly not feeling well. Alexis didn’t know what to do so he just followed Justin’s lead. He walked to the front of the class, trying his best to avoid looking at the other students, but he knew all their eyes were on him.<br />
<br />
Justin walked him outside where he stopped and stood with his back on the wall, taking in deep breath after deep breath. He was regaining some kind of composure, but still felt very uncomfortable. He needed someone to come out and help him.<br />
“Alex, listen I’m gonna be right next to you if you need to, like, go to the bathroom or-” Justin said, but suddenly stopped. Alexis lifted his head to see what had happened. Justin was stood there, eyes wide, looking across the hall. Alexis turned his head and saw a familiar face.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, Alexis are you...” June quickly ran over to him, only giving Justin a quick glance. She placed her arms around Alexis, “let’s get you somewhere private,” she said,<br />
“J-June... hi... uhm...” Justin tried to speak, but stumbled over his words,<br />
“Thank you Justin, I’ve got it,” She said passive aggressively to her ex-boyfriend, “you can go back to your class,”<br />
“W-wha- I mean... I can do it it’s-”<br />
“I’ve got it, Justin.” She said, ushering him away as she led Alexis to a bathroom.<br />
Justin just did what she said, a little ashamed. He stepped back into the classroom.<br />
<br />
June, being the opposite sex to Alexis, decided to bring him into the girls bathroom. Alexis wasn’t completely aware of what was going on, he just followed her.<br />
<br />
As he stepped inside, seeing the many stalls, he collapsed. Not unconscious, but not okay.<br />
“Here,” June said, handing him the bottle of water she gave him before,<br />
“Nghh...” Alexis groaned. He couldn’t bring his arms up to grab it. June laid his back against the wall, unscrewed the cap and made the decision to pour the water for him.<br />
 She placed the bottle in his mouth, and lifted his head slightly. He did begin to swallow it.<br />
<br />
Quickly, his vision became clearer, and his sickening feeling started to disappear. He looked ahead, seeing a pretty brunette pouring water down his throat. It wasn’t even something he would consider fantasising about, but something about it made him feel somewhat aroused.<br />
Within seconds of enjoying the situation, he just absorbed all of the information, and spat out the water. June wasn’t quick enough to dodge it. The water went right into her chest, covering her white shirt.<br />
Alexis wiped his mouth with his arm,<br />
“Shit, I’m so sorry,” he blurted out. His vision suddenly obscured by the sight of her bra through her shirt. She didn’t notice his glance, but Alexis felt the feeling turn from intense discomfort, to a weird pleasure.<br />
“I-it’s fine...” she said, holding her hands up, unable to do much. She realised that she had dropped the bottle in the moment, “damn.” She said. She then looked down at her chest, “ah shit,” she quickly stood up and looked into the mirror to assess the damage.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!?” She almost shouted,<br />
Alexis was confused, and quickly jumped straight up with her, looking in the mirror at her. Aside from her wet shirt, something had changed.<br />
Her hair. The usual long brown hair suddenly had two streaks of blonde running down the sides. Alexis knew exactly what had happened,<br />
“H-how...” she said, running her fingers down the streaks. Alexis didn’t know how to talk his way out of this, “Alexis, what just happened!?” She asked rhetorically, looking at him through the mirror,<br />
“I-I...” he couldn’t speak, “it might be because of me...” he said, not really thinking.<br />
“W-what?” She said, turning to face him in person, “what do you mean? How could this be because of you?”<br />
“I don’t know... but... I think it is,”<br />
“B-but that doesn’t make any sense,” she said, looking at herself in the mirror again, “how could you have changed my hair colour by spitting water at my boobs?”<br />
“N-no it’s...” he hesitated, looking back her chest, “it’s not that... I... I can’t explain it but...” he hesitated,<br />
“But?”<br />
“I think I can show you,” Alexis blurted out.</p>
