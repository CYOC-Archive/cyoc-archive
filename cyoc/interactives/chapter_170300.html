<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment he pressed enter, Jeff blacked out. <br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke inside a room which he had never seen before. Clearly it was some kind of medical facility though, most likely a hospital. Apparently quite some time has passed between when he blacked out and now, as snow was building up on the window sill. Just how long had he been out for, and why?<br />
<br />
It was then Jeff finally noticed the obvious. He was no longer pregnant. What he saw in place of his formerly massive belly was a nice and smooth, normal sized abdomen. He was no longer as fat as a cow. And had returned to having a normal human shaped body, albeit a very, VERY feminine one. <br />
<br />
The reason Jeff knew he had a normal sized torso, was only because he could feel it with his hands. His view was completely obstructed by his still massive breasts. Jeff figured that they had to be at least H- cups. He tried kifting up one to examine them, and not only felt, but heard a sloshing sound come from inside. Curious, he undid his gown in order to get a better view, only to find something he didn&#39;t expect. <br />
<br />
His boobs, which by now he understood would be lactating profusely, each had a thin, white rubber tube comming from his nipples. Upon further inspection, it wasn&#39;t a white tube, but a clear tube, filled with milk, his milk. Each tube ran into a machine which he guessed was a milk pump of some kind, which to his surprise, collected the milk into what appeared to be a water cooler resovior sized container, which was just about full. <br />
<br />
It was then someone began to speak behind him. &quot;Ah, I see you are finally awake Miss. But I implore you to keep your movememts to a minimum, you are still recovering from your extensive surgery. To bring you up to speed, my name is Dr. Camilla Merris and I have been overseeing you and your babys for the entire length of your stay here. This may be a bit of a shock, but you have been unconscious for 2 months and a week now, about 9 weeks in total. You are a very lucky woman you know. If your mother hadn&#39;t found you when she did, I can image what would have happened.&quot; Explained the female doctor. <br />
<br />
She was sexy to say the least. Dr. Camilla Merris wasn&#39;t short by any means, and her heels only made her long legs look even hotter. She was wearing a lab coat, which she had opened the front of, as well as a black pencil skirt, with a long vertical slit along the right side&#39;s thigh. Her top was showing off her cleavage a bit too. Jeff felt that her brown hair, which she had tied into a neat bun, also added to her &quot;sexy but professional&quot; doctor look. But she also had said something massive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it really been months?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Camilla face turned into a sympathetic look. &quot;Yes, unfortunately. It has been quite some time since you first arived here. But on a more positive side, I am happy to inform you that you are the proud mother of a healthy pair of twin baby girls. They were finally born about a week ago. And well, I call them twins, but the one is seemingly a few months older than her sister. However, what is baffling is that they are identical in terms of their genome. They are identical twins, but not twins. Honestly we don&#39;t even have a clue how it is even possible and were all curious as to if you had any ideas? But that can be saved for later. I am sure you want to see your babies as soon as possible too. And you will soon, however first there are some things that we need to discuss. But in the mean time, I will send a nurse to get your baby girls while we speak if that is ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, not entirely sure how he felt now being a mother of twin girls. He had carried them for so long that he couldn&#39;t help getting attached to them, but he also knew that until now, he never wanted either one of them, nor had made any plans to raise them. He didn&#39;t even own a crib or a single pair of diapers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then. I have to ask, but do you have any idea about who is the father? Depending on your answer, we may need to do some extra things as a precaution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You nod and just point at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, well self insemination isn&#39;t usually an issue for hermaphrodites like us. Oh, I guess I should have mentioned earlier that I am also like you, a hermaphrodite. I am the head Doctor here and specifically am in charge of all of our hermaphroditic patients. On a side note, We can make your micro-penis normal sized if you woukd like, or even turn it into a clitoris if you wish to look like a complete women. Or you can just keep it as is. I won&#39;t judge.<br />
Anyways, with this being self insemination, you have full custody rights, and will be registered as being both legal parents, at least unless you find or have a partner you wish to have designated as their father. We would still need their confirmation of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I am single, and I am a man, not a women.&quot; Jeff corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, maybe our records are off. We have you listed as a female hermaphrodite. But I can see about changing that. Though if you want my opinion, it may be easier to be listed as a female hermaphrodite, at least on record, because it helps you out more when it comes to raising your daughters as a single parent. Things like seeing your gynaecologist and certain products will be covered more by the healthcare insurance agency that&#39;s partnered with this hispital.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff had to admit, he was more or less completely female. Only 1 inch of masculinity was left on his body, and it was now just offered to be turned into his clitoris. Plus she had a point, he would need those check ups and feminine products now that he had birthed 2 daughters. He really should have been going already, but the thought had never even occured to him. Maybe just committing to being a female hermaphrodite was the right choice? He already had given birth, has massive boobs, an extremely feminine body, and even sounded unquestionably like a woman. &quot;I, guess you can leave it as is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood Miss. Speaking of, now that you are committing to live as a female herm, do you want a new name to fit your ide tity better? Jeff isn&#39;t really a women&#39;s name. But that is up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I guess your right. I guess for now change it to be... umm....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would like a suggestion, I think you would make for an excellent Camille.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it is similar though. My name is Camilla, yours would be Camille. The last letter is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks... but do you have any other idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Ekaterina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, yeah, I could get use to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Ekaterina it is. Is there anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. We have a few different points to discuss. One concerns your breasts, one concerns your body, one concerns your sex life, and the last point is a bit more of a personal inquiry. Which do you want to handle first?</p>
