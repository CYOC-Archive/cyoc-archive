<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You’re right. Take me to the river.” You say, managing to pull yourself together enough to know your parents wouldn’t appreciate their daughter having sex in their driveway for everyone to see, not to mention your little brother. By this point, don’t even realize that you think of yourself as a ‘daughter’. You still remember being a boy named Eric but now that part is in the very back of your mind. You hop off Tony’s lap as he gets ready to pull out of your driveway, hoping your parents didn’t hear or see you were already home before.<br />
<br />
“We’ll be there in a few minutes.” Tony says as he drives down the road. Your female hormones are raging from feeling his member rub up against your wet womanhood. In fact, the lust filled haze in your mind is only getting stronger. You look over at Tony, specifically his pants which are still unzipped. Looking at his erection causes you to lick your lips and stare with hungry eyes. You get a thought thanks to your female mind. It’s a nice size…but what if it was bigger?<br />
<br />
You pull out the flashlight and set the light to bright blue. Aiming at his groin you hit the on button. Holding it there you can see his dick growing larger and thicker quickly. After a solid minute you finally turn it off. Tony’s member is now huge, around 12 inches long and 3 inches thick, around his groin everything seemed to have also gotten more defined and masculine. <br />
<br />
Seeing those results, you can’t help yourself and turn it back on. You start at his feet and slowly move up giving each area quite a bit of the transforming light. His legs puff out with muscle and strength, not only that they seem to have lengthened. His shoes have also seemingly grown with his feet. You skip over his groin but notice his pants and underwear have also grown to keep his monster cock contained.<br />
<br />
Passing over his top have had the exact same effect it had on his lower half. His abs become a chiseled six-pack along with all the rest of his muscle in his stomach area. His pecs grow out along with the muscles in his arms, with his biceps and triceps gaining huge amounts of strength and lengthening out. Without even thinking about the effects on his mind it could have you shine the light right on his head. Once you’re satisfied with the change, his face which was already handsome has almost become a perfect representation of masculinity. He doesn’t look like a total body builder but still in great shape. <br />
<br />
Tony however noticed nothing wrong with it. He had always worked out and was glad you were asking him to take her to the river. That was after the blue light went over his head. Before Tony had been very nervous about pleasing you there. Now he was very confident in his ability to satisfy you.<br />
<br />
Seeing the results of your work, you once again feel a rush of hormones which give you another idea. You change the light back to bright pink and point it at your feet. Turning the light on immediately starts to send pleasurable tingles up and down your body. Your flat shoes begin to turn into high black 6-inch heels. You can see your toes are now well manicured and polished a color red. Moving the light up doesn’t do much to your calf’s but when it reaches your thighs both begin to fill up with fat. They become supple and perfectly proportioned without becoming unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Moving up to your vagina sends waves of pleasure that nearly force you to moan out loud. Your butt begins to fill up much like your thighs becoming a nice large bubble butt that from behind is a perfect heart shape. Your hips expand to become childbearing proportions while your waist caves in to give yourself a perfect hourglass figure. You then shine the light on each of your arms which only affects your hands as they become dainty and manicured like your toes. They also gain a red polish.<br />
<br />
Even though you had already increased your bust size, you decide to give it another go, unable to stop yourself from the flood of female emotions and hormones. As you shined it on your D cups, your dress begins to morph from a white dress into a silk, tight fitting, red one piece and only went down to middle of your thighs. The upper part of your dress now shows off a great amount of your growing cleavage. You keep the light there for longer than your other parts but the results in your mind was worth it. Part of the reason you left it on your chest for longer is the pleasure overriding any rational thought. When you finally shut it off, your chest has now grown to full on F cups that somehow remained perky, not even needing the bra behind the dress, which had also shifted to fit your massive bust and matches your new panties.<br />
<br />
Finally, you turn the flashlight to your face. This was it, you briefly considered stopping here or at the very least keeping your eyes closed. For once the male part of you stops yourself. You tightly close your eyes getting ready to flick on the bright pink light. You turn it on, and the same pleasurable tingles are now on your face. It almost causes you to open your eyes, but you manage to keep them closed. But then Tony reaches the dirt road to the river and hits a bump in the road. Your eyes shoot open from the sudden bounce, right into the light.<br />
<br />
You don’t even have time to think about closing them again or shutting the light off, it’s too late, you now have no desire to remain male in body or mind from that small flash of pink light. Female emotions immediately flood your mind as they override any amount of your male mind that remained. Being female now feels completely natural, like you’ve always been like this. Your face completely changes while your mind is put under siege by the pink light. Your lips become full and gain a red gloss of lipstick over them. Your face is cleared of any imperfections and now covered in a tasteful amount of makeup. Your hair changes to a blonde color as it lengthens to nearly reach your butt.<br />
<br />
Your personality is now completely female and with nothing less to change there, the light starts to completely change your memories. You remember growing up as a girl going through high school as a girl. Boys hit on you all the time due to your busty body and perfect face and while you dated a few of them you had never felt this way towards a boy like Tony. The light finally goes out on its own due to running out of energy though there was nothing left to change in your head anyway.<br />
<br />
You close your eyes as the memories slowly settled down in your head. Everything had changed. Your personality was slightly bubbly, but you weren’t a total bimbo either. That didn’t mean you didn’t love the feelings your body gave you. The name Eric means nothing to you other than it being a boy’s name, even the name Erica was foreign. It wasn’t your name anymore. You open your new emerald, green eyes after the car finally comes to a stop. <br />
<br />
“We’re here, Melissa.” Tony says to you as he pushes his seat back. You look over at him and lick your lips. You crawl on top of him as he lays back into his seat. Both of you begin to intensely make-out. Tony wraps his arms around your back as you hold his face. You then feel your red dress becoming looser, Tony is pulling down the zipper there. You don’t stop him, instead you move your head down to his jeans where you unzip them and put a hand down his underwear, rubbing his growing erection.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the only thing left on either of your bodies are Tony’s underwear and your panties and bra. Leaning back up you unclasp your red lacy bra letting your girls bounce freely. “Come on. Grab ‘em,” you tell Tony who wastes no time and grabs them, sensually rubbing and squishing them together. You moan out in pleasure and tighten your grab on his member using your other hand to lower Tony’s underwear to free his foot-long. You then quickly use your hands to remove your own panties, throwing them into the other seat.<br />
<br />
“Ready, Melissa?” Tony asks already knowing the answer. “Oh yeah!” You look down at his dick, lining it up with your womanhood. Slowly you descend, biting your bottom lip as his length fills you. Eventually you reach the base and moan out as you barely manage to take the whole thing. You then start moving your hips and bouncing on top of Tony. The car begins to squeak and shake with your movements as you both get more intense with your lovemaking.<br />
<br />
Tony is clearly having the time of his life, thrusting his hips with you and grabbing one of your massive tits. After a few minutes, you feel yourself clenching rapidly until you can’t hold it anymore, “I’M CUMMING!”, you scream out in pure ecstasy. You orgasm intensely, squeezing Tony’s dick until he orgasms as well. Tony can only grit his teeth, unable to give a warning. You feel the first shot of his load paint your inner walls, followed quickly by another until he’s fired off at least 10 times, completely filling you up.<br />
<br />
You lay on top of Tony for a few minutes catching your breath until you look at the clock in the car and its almost 11 pm. You kiss him on the cheek, “We should head back. My parents might start to get worried or worse, suspicious.” Tony agrees and within a couple of minutes your back on the road and soon back at your place.<br />
<br />
You give Tony another kiss but this time on the lips, “Thank babe. I really needed that. See you around.” You get out of the car, the flashlight falling out. Odd, you don’t remember bringing a flashlight with you. You ask him about it. “I don’t remember it either. Keep it, I’ve already got one in the back,” he tells you. <br />
<br />
After he drives off you enter the house where your little brother is still up, “Hey Melissa, how’d your date go?” You simply smirk and walk up the stairs to your room and turn around, “You know the drill.”<br />
<br />
Aaron looks at you and rolls his eyes, “Yeah, yeah, tell mom and dad you came home on time.” You smile and start walking back up the stairs with the flashlight in hand. Aaron notices it and sees its strange buttons but can’t ask about before you walk into your room.<br />
<br />
After changing out of your dress, you climb in bed and are fast asleep. Not even thinking about the potential consequences of you and Tony’s lovemaking in the car. Nor whatever that flashlight is.</p>
