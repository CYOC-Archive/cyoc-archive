<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was in the bathroom admiring his new look, trying to resist the urge to look up different neck tie knots he could learn. &#39;The classic Windsor Knot is more than sufficient for 99% of situations and I need to be focused on fixing things before they get out of hand.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh, Shit, shit, shit.&quot; Came Mike&#39;s muffled grumblings from several rooms away... &quot;Ugh, Jeff!&quot; Mike called louder.<br />
It had only been a few minutes since their conversation, Jeff hadn&#39;t even gotten to begin thinking of his next approach to the situation, preoccupied thinking a charcoal gray suit with a lilac shirt would look much better than a light gray suit. Jeff&#39;s dress shoes made a satisfying clunk with every step and Jeff couldn&#39;t help but stand straighter as he approached the stairs. &quot;Yes, is something wrong? Are you hurt?&quot; Expletives are usually saved for injury in their house. Jeff peered over the railing getting a view of Mike in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know tonight is my monthly plans with my coworkers, right? Well, next month was supposed to be my turn to host, but Luke and his family came down with a stomach flu and the whole lot of them has been doing nothing but vomiting and sleeping all day. He just woke up and remembered to text to cancel. Well we only meet at most once a month, but the last three were canceled for a variety of reasons and the guys are asking if I can step up and host tonight. Meaning I have about 2 hours and 10 minutes to plan a meal or a hearty snack for 6 other men, get supplies, clean up the house, and find a way to make it up to your mother later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Did you need me to go shopping with you, or for you? And mom&#39;s spending the night with Aunt Jess, why would she care what we do tonight?&quot; Jeff asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but she&#39;s having fun, she doesn&#39;t want us to have fun in her absence, that would make her feel... you&#39;ll get it when you&#39;re older. I need to go shopping but while I&#39;m gone I need you to help with cleaning, and maybe some food prep. Could you check on supplies? Beer, chips, crackers, cheese... and whatever else might make a party? ... and get out of your suit... honestly, If you could just be normal. I want you to fit in...&quot; Mike sighed not knowing how to say any more and keep from causing his son therapy. <br />
<br />
Jeff cringed, &quot;Dad! be careful how you word things! The genie wish...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, I need you to forget about that stuff, at least for tonight. Magic isn&#39;t something grown men talk about or believe in!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff scoffed but headed back to his room realizing it was probably safer than engaging with his father who was saying stuff like... like? Something about how his dad worded stuff? Jeff was left shrugging his shoulders while he was swapping from a suit to normal clothing. By the time he was in shorts and a t-shirt he was wondering why he was wearing the constrictive, uncomfortable, and frankly hot clothing in the first place. He shot a confused look at the lamp. It didn&#39;t fit the room, and he didn&#39;t recall where it came from. But time was tight and he needed to be heading to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
By the time Jeff got to the kitchen, his dad was on the phone playing up the stress of having people over and belaboring the inconvenience of the guys throwing this on him last minute. Jeff began ransacking the kitchen for supplies finding one unopened and 3 stale chip bags. No dip, 4 cans of beer. a limp stalk of celery and some paper plates and napkins.<br />
<br />
Dad hung up with mom and walked into the kitchen to assess Jeff&#39;s findings, &quot;I&#39;ll need your help getting things ready but after that your mom wanted me to ask if you had a friend you could play with or something, she&#39;s afraid you&#39;d get bored in your room with weird people over...&quot; Mike mentioned hanging up the phone, looking at the meager offerings Jeff found. and looking in the fridge for any support supplies he could find with a grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... no.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike pulled out some additional supplies from the fridge and cabinet, and a crock pot materialized from somewhere. Within minutes a variety of beans were in the crock pot with seasonings and tomatoes and an onion was diced and sautéing. A small bit of ground beef was about to be browned and more was needed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Beef, chips, vegie tray, fixings, beer... Could you clean the kitchen, back deck, and in case the weather turns cold, clean and set up a table in the garage just in case... Oh, bowls and spoons...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Okay dad&quot; Jeff tried to follow the chores but was distracted by the fact that his dad was cooking... actually cooking... not throwing something on the grill or in the oven... not boiling water for pasta, but dicing and sautéing onions, and browning beef for... chili? &quot;You can cook?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike snickered. &quot;Of course. Your mom likes to cook for the family. She&#39;s old fashioned that way and yells at me that I&#39;m making her useless when I do something in the kitchen, but real men can make a rue.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a ...&quot;<br />
&quot;You should figure that out, and experiment, sometime when we aren&#39;t expecting a house full of people in under an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike dumped ingredients in the crock pot... the proportions were all wrong due to the supplies on hand but Mike had a list going. &quot;Alright kiddo, I&#39;ll be back. There&#39;s a good chance some of them will get here before I make it back. If that happens, don&#39;t hide in your room, be sociable, just... be one of the guys and try to fit in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes, &quot;Okay dad, that was a year and a half ago and you didn&#39;t warn me people would come inside.&quot;<br />
Mike eyed Jeff warily. &quot;Fine, clean... they could be here early and show up in 30 minutes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff started in the garage, sweeping dust out, then setting up a large folding table and chairs, he moved into the kitchen cleaning the breakfast dishes, cutting board and knives, then pulling out serving bowls for chips, dips, vegies and whatever else his dad may bring home. Returning to the garage to grab the outdoor broom for the deck Jeff noticed a car pull in. Remembering his dad&#39;s request, Jeff slapped on a big grin as he grabbed the broom and went out to greet the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, this was last minute notice and my dad ran out to grab supplies, He should be back in the next 15-30 minutes but asked me to greet you. I&#39;m still cleaning things up, just got the back deck left, did you want to come in?&quot; Jeff asked trying to pretend he knew and liked this guy...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Hey, I&#39;m Dave. and you&#39;re Jeff right? Mike&#39;s said nothing but good things about you.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good at least.&quot; Jeff gave an award winning smile though thought it was weird that the first thing he&#39;d say is how they talked about him behind his back. Dave looked older than his dad by a few years, probably mid 50s and a little rotund. Jeff led the way to the kitchen, &quot;Oh, dad&#39;s picking up more for the gathering but your okay with Miller right?&quot; Jeff remembered Dave claiming to like the brand, or at least drink it in the past, though couldn&#39;t place when he picked up the information. He reached into the fridge grabbing 2 of the 4 remaining beers and offering one to Dave. <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mind if I do.&quot; Dave said with a friendly grin.<br />
Jeff cracked open his beer and took a couple heavy swigs, &quot;Well, I&#39;d better finish up before more people show. You&#39;re welcome to join me or stay in here.&quot; Jeff walked out the sliding patio door to the deck finding his friend Dave was following him. The pair made small talk as Dave lit a cigar and Jeff swept. Dave offered one to Jeff who accepted and neither noticed the ash tray that faded into existence on the patio table. Jeff finished the sweeping and returned the broom, coming back a moment later with a damp cloth and began wiping the patio furniture down. Finishing his chores he conversed with Dave enjoying his beer and cigar unaware how drastically he changed to fit in with Dave, the only other person currently there. <br />
Jeff was quickly passing through his thirties, had been divorced, can&#39;t seem to keep his weight down and has a growing career in sales. He got out of his marriage before kids entered the picture and the dating scene just isn&#39;t what it was when he was 28 and weighed 80 less lbs.</p>
