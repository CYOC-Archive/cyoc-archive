<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a dream Jake said to himself as he laid in his warm bed starting to wake up. He had dreamt he got a game that could change the world around him. When Jake opened his eyes he saw the wooden bars of his crib. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo,&quot; he cried to himself. He wasn’t dreaming after all. It was all real after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jakey.&quot; Mandy said as she entered the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have a good nap?&quot; she asked. Mandy looked like she got done with her own nap. Her hair was messed up and her clothes were all wrinkled up. <br />
<br />
Jake only nodded his head in reply to say ‘yes’. “Better to play along then to get fussy with her.” he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy says you too little for me to play with.&quot; Mandy said now booting the computer in the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I am going to make you bigger so we can play.&quot; Mandy said as she clicked on the icon in the game. <br />
<br />
Jake sat up and clapped his hands to this news. He then made sounds of delight to show he agreed with Mandy. <br />
<br />
&quot;When you bigger than me you didn’t want to dance. So I better make you younger then me.&quot; Mandy reasoned as she selected the baby character on the screen. <br />
<br />
With a sudden jolt of feelings, Jake found he was a lot bigger now. He was still in a diaper but much bigger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two.&quot; Mandy said as she saved the game then switched off the computer. She walked over to his crib after computer’s power was off. <br />
<br />
Jake supposed that meant he was two years old now. To test his theory he stood up. “Yes,” he thought, “I can stand on my own.” <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mandee.&quot; Jake piped in a babyish voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oldwer.&quot; Jake said as he pointed at the computer. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. No. I want you to play with me.&quot; Mandy said as she stretched out her arms for him to climb down into. Jake easily slipped over the bars and with Mandy’s help, made a soft landing on the carpet with his feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Timmee?&quot; Asked Jake said as soon his feet touched the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh, He still slweeping.&quot; She said as she put her finger to her mouth as she took his hand and led him out to her room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Plway what?&quot; Jake asked as they entered the hallway toward her room. <br />
<br />
&quot;House silly.&quot; Mandy answer back as they enter her room. <br />
<br />
&quot;You going to be the baby and Timmy is the daddy when he wakes up.&quot; Mandy explained as she shut the door. <br />
<br />
With door shut tight, Jake had no choice as Mandy drug a box out of her closet. He was too small to open the door. Jake knew he could reach the handle, but he couldn’t turn the knob. <br />
<br />
Mandy proceeded to open the box and pull out her biggest doll clothes. Jake was dressed in a blue button shirt and bonnet before he knew what happen. Mandy had finally found what she was looking for. She then pulled out a baby’s bib for him to wear. Mandy knotted it twice as she tied around his neck. <br />
<br />
Feeling like a over dressed doll, Jake sat there while she pretended to spoon feed him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lookee, Daddy is home.&quot; She said when Timmy came into the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Playing house?&quot; Timmy asked, already knowing the answer. Mandy would play the same games over and over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup and you’re the daddy.&quot; Mandy said then handing him a hat to wear. She had on a big round pink hat with flowers and matching dress that went down to her feet. Jake thought Timmy was very funny when he put the hat on. It slipped all the down past his ears. The rim of the hat was barely above his eyebrows now. <br />
<br />
None of children noticed that Jake and Mandy’s mother peaked in on them. Upon seeing such an adorable site she ran back down the hallway to get her camera. She quietly crept back, leaning her body into view with the camera ready. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cookies!&quot; She said. When they all smiled at the word and looked at her, she pushed the button on the camera. <br />
<br />
A great white flash hit their eyes and spots of light were still dancing in front of them when she took one more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! We trying to play house.&quot; Mandy said with a irritated tone of voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; she said leaning back out of the room and closing the door behind her. Another hour of playing house passed before all three were very bored. They then played nearly ten rounds of Sorry. Mandy was winning nearly every game. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch!&quot; Jake heard his mother say from somewhere downstairs. <br />
<br />
Jake was unable to undo the knots that held his bib. Mandy left it on Jake as they went down the steps. All other clothing was put back in the box before they left the room. <br />
<br />
Jake was happy to see it was chicken fingers and there was one for him on a small plate. Jake’s mother lifted him into the high chair. He barely fit now in it. She cut up his chicken into small squares and set them in front of him to eat. He used his fingers to eat while Mandy and Timmy used forks to eat their chicken fingers. <br />
<br />
Mandy was a little jealous when her Mom cut up her brother’s chicken and then let him eat with his fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I use a fork?&quot; Mandy asked when she saw her mother cut up another chicken for Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because you’re big girl, honey.&quot; She explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jakey doesn’t have to use a fork.&quot; Mandy said to show her point. <br />
<br />
&quot;He’s baby, dear. He doesn’t know how yet.&quot; her mother said as she put the pieces on Jake’s plate. <br />
<br />
&quot;upmfh.&quot; Mandy said, pouting as she watched Jake use his fingers again. <br />
<br />
This gave Jake an idea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oldwer!&quot; he said, pointing at Mandy. <br />
<br />
&quot;That’s right, Jake. Mandy is older then you.&quot; his mother congratulated him. <br />
<br />
After lunch all the kids were back in the living room. Mandy didn’t play as much with the toys her mother bought them as she normally would have. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, I am the baby of family. Come with me.&quot; Mandy ordered, taking Jake by the hand. She left Timmy alone to play while they climbed the steps. <br />
<br />
Their mother was too busy cleaning up to notice two the children left for the nursery slash computer room. <br />
<br />
Mandy turned on the computer then selected the baby Jake character in the game. In a blink of eye, Jake found himself back to his 7-year-old self again.</p>
