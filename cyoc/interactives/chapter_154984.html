<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James Miller had been uncertain about his future in general. Feasting on various of different vegetation in Henry&#39;s garden had soothed his  mind normally, but today the ecstacy of eating vegetables wouldn&#39;t suffice. His feelings or her feelings dragged on, and the mental battle between &#39;Is he a man or a woman raged on&#39;.<br />
<br />
The weather had been colder in the cabin, tree leaves were falling down, and even though the vegetables in the garden should be beginning to rot; The cabin would work it&#39;s magic, and preserve the garden &quot;Almost just for me&quot;, James thought this as he had a mouthful of greens.<br />
<br />
James continued his onslaught of the ideal food of a horse, and as he was standing in the garden..... He picked up on a smell, it was a smelly smell, only a few weeks ago James disgusted would have stopped eating from this garden, but now that smell was so enticing.<br />
<br />
Wearing a sundress with a shirt underneath had it&#39;s advantages and disadvantages for James. No sweatpants could contain his hips, and horse cock. This left him having to wear a sundress, which made him feel sexy, but there was a part of him that was humiliated by this.<br />
<br />
As he kneeled down to smell the greens with that funky odor, this left his butt high in the air, and his sex exposed to the cold breeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Dakotaaa&#128149;&quot;, God it was amazing for James, never in his life did he smell something &#39;That Good!&#39;. It was cum, Dakotas cum. James  could notice a figure in the corner of his eye. He looked up, and noticed Dakota around the treeline, staring at him almost saying &quot; Do you like that? Come back, and lets go for round two....&quot;. Yellow streak of hair confirmed to James it was Dakota.<br />
<br />
&quot;James can we talk&quot;, Melissa opened the front door, and seemed disgruntled. Talking would have too wait, as the first thing she saw was James&#39;s large horse vagina, horse tail probing the dress up even higher. Melissa ran back into the cabin, feeling worse than before.<br />
<br />
James had been avoiding her, and she needed to know why! &quot;I&#39;m Melissa, any man would love me.... So why doesn&#39;t he want me?&quot;. Before they got into the cabin, they had only a couple sexy times, but the sex was so amazing! Now in this cabin where arousal is like 8 fold increased, and now he doesn&#39;t want me?<br />
<br />
As Melissa was thinking she couldn&#39;t help, but look at that man in the kitchen. Melissa was gawking, and watching as Henry was making dinner. &quot;Now that&#39;s a man..... A real breadwinner&quot;, Melissa walked away into her room. She knew that Henry was as old as her own father. Whenever she thought of her own father she could only think of grabbing his dick, sucking, and getting on all fours getting fucked by her own father, making herself pant............<br />
<br />
 What is happening to me?&quot;, Melissa made her way to the door, and felt ill from that vision she just had.  <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
James made his way back to his room, knowing Melissa had seen him made him disgusted, and he promptly went back into the cabin. The two werent sharing a room yet, but James knew Melissa would ask eventually. In his room James looked at his large mirror, he hadn&#39;t even examined his body yet, fearing what he would see!<br />
<br />
The truth to the matter is, before James and Joan came back to the cabin; There were actually pants that would have fit James, but his closet had changed clothes. His pants and other manly clothes in his closet...... Transformed into Dresses and bra&#39;s! Thats it.... It was like the cabin was mocking him.<br />
<br />
James grabbed the black lingerie bra by his mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no going back after I put this bra on, every crazy thing I said outside... To Dakota would be what I want. I can&#39;t call myself a man anymore. I would change my name, Melissa was teasing me earlier, but Jamie sounds right......&quot;, as James muttered this he took his dress/shirt off, and examined his body for the first time.<br />
<br />
[ His hair was of a normal mans length| Face was the same besides lacking facial hair| He has fairly large horse ears]<br />
<br />
[Arms were of a normal mans size| Skin was way more feminine and was a tint darker]<br />
<br />
[His once manly pecks are now C cup breasts, the same size as his mothers. In slight pain, his breasts were oddly slightly more full?]<br />
<br />
[His waist had gotten a lot wider, you could say he has nice birthing hips| Nicer, and more thick butt, that anyone in the cabin would stare at]<br />
<br />
[Blackish brown horse tail]<br />
<br />
[His once human penis has been changed to a large horse cock| Underneath his balls was a big horse vagina that was pumping estrogen throughout his body|His once human asshole has been converted into a horse doughnut]<br />
<br />
[His legs have gotten fatter, but his bones are way stronger than a normal humans, giving him the look of thick strong legs!]<br />
<br />
[Human feet have now been changed into horse hooves]<br />
<br />
No denying how much he has changed, James looked at the bra......... But he remembered something he once told his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as &#39;magic&#39; turning people into animals. Into women. I&#39;m no woman.&quot;, This is what James had said to Jess only a month ago. Look at how far he has fallen from grace. Thinking of what he said, and how he said it made James gain some of his old willpower back. Knowing that his next few changes would probably turn him into a complete woman, and his remaining changes would be his last horse changes; Made James realize now he needs to hold on to his humanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you Cabin I&#39;m a Man!!!&quot;, James threw the bra at the mirror not in anger, but in defiance!<br />
<br />
James feeling good after letting all that energy out grabbed his shirt, but he noticed something in the mirror? His black areola surrounding his nipples were larger, and more pronounced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats strange why didn&#39;t I not notice this before?&quot;, As James said this he touched his nipple, and a white substance dripped out of his breast. He knew that was milk............. Breast milk, he was lactating! James instantly grabbed his shirt and put it on, not wanting to admit what he just saw. Just like before a thought came ringing back into his mind however......... Something he thought only 5 days ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;He imagined being filled by cum. Filled so much his belly bulged. Holding it in. Letting it settle, warm and fertile. Letting it take. Belly pregnant with Dakota&#39;s offspring. That could happen. It really could... He could let it happen. The curse would work that way. It almost definitely would happen&quot;. This is what he thought not even a week ago. James only had one thing to say now...............<br />
<br />
&quot;Im Pregnant....&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
                                                                                      [NOTE]  [Cabin Rules Of Child Birth]<br />
[A baby will take 7-9 months to actually be born| If James is somewhat human by that time the baby will be human| The baby would be half James and half the human the donkey was before entering the cabin| If James is a full horse by that time the baby will either be a horse or donkey| If James escapes from the cabin by some miracle, he will be a man again and forget this ever happened| Normally a person in the cabin wouldn&#39;t get pregnant| James in his lustfilled mind had basically asked for it, and the cabin was eager to oblige]</p>
