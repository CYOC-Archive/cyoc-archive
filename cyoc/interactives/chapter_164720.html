<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The person at the door turned out to be a 34 year old latino woman with long black hair by the name of Jessica Lange. She was a prominent accountant for a corporation who mainly worked from her home and was his next-door neighbor. She also happened to be one of Sarah’s best friends the two having bonded in the short month that he had her come live with him in preparation for his regression back to toddlerhood. However as far as Jessica knew Sarah was his live-in housekeeper who cooked, cleaned and watched his house whenever he was away on a trip.<br />
<br />
Thomas immediately wanted to groan the moment he saw who it was.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t that he disliked the woman, he liked her well enough. He just got exasperated whenever she visited because the two of them would talk endlessly about this and that, usual girl stuff. Often times Thomas would just leave the room until they were done conversing and then come back toward the end of their conversation.<br />
<br />
However, given his current position and state that was no longer an option for him now. Instead he decided to just remain quiet and suck his thumb until she went away.<br />
<br />
Before Jessica could greet her friend she immediately took notice of Thomas, a grin appearing at the sight of the adorable toddler.<br />
<br />
“Oh my, Sarah you didn’t tell me you were babysitting?” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Giving him a slight bounce as he she readjusted her grip Sarah replied, “Yeah sorry about that Jess. I was going to tell you but it kind of happened last minute.”<br />
<br />
“So who is this cutie pie anyway, and how old is he?” Jessica inquired.<br />
<br />
The way the woman was ogling him Thomas became worried that she might pinch his cheeks or something, which he did not want.<br />
<br />
“Oh this here is Luke, he’s Thomas’s 18 month old cousin who I agreed to watch for a week. They originally asked Thomas to do it but he already had a trip planned to go to Rio de Janeiro. In fact he left by plane just this morning and won’t be back for a week in case you’re wondering” Sarah said using the agreed upon lie that they had both came up with to explain his mysterious absence. And it was believable as after he had won the lottery and collected his earnings; he quit his job, brought the large house and fancy car then to pass the time decided to travel around the world, choosing a new destination every three or four months. So far he had already been to New York, Paris and Egypt but now that he was de-aged Thomas was considering taking the next six months off from his global excursions to enjoy his babyhood.<br />
<br />
Jessica nodded in understanding, “Ah, so that’s where rich boy is” she said using the nickname she had given him after finding out he was wealthy.<br />
<br />
Not totally hating it Thomas allowed her to keep using it.<br />
<br />
“It’s probably for the best anyway. I don’t think he much like being around with a baby in the house.”<br />
<br />
“Well you’d be surprised” Sarah replied with a knowing grin.<br />
<br />
Jessica raised an eyebrow at that but let it slide once again focusing her attention on Thomas who felt slightly uncomfortable under the woman’s gaze.<br />
<br />
“He’s not a very talkative little guy is he now” she commented at the toddler’s quiet nature.<br />
<br />
“Oh Luke’s just very shy around strangers but once he gets to know you he becomes a very excitable tyke” Sarah quickly explained.<br />
<br />
“Well I think it makes him even more adorable” Jessica said giving the hair on Thomas’s head a playful ruffle, “Has he been any trouble for you?” she said immediately thinking of the dreaded terrible two’s.<br />
<br />
“Not at all. But I only picked him up an hour ago and so far all he’s done is explore the house. The most exciting thing I’ve done so far is change a wet and poopy diaper of his” Sarah teased with a smile and Thomas couldn’t help but blush at the mention of his diaper change. For some reason Sarah really enjoyed bringing it up to embarrass him, and oddly enough he was kind of okay with it.<br />
<br />
“Maybe the reason he’s so quiet is because he needs a change right now. Here let me check his diaper real quick” Jessica offered and before he could react her hand was pressing against the seat of his pamper.<br />
<br />
Squeezing the crunchy plastic backing a couple of times the woman’s expression turned thoughtful, “Huh, I don’t feel anything which means he didn’t poop.”<br />
<br />
“Check to see if he’s wet. He might have peed while we were talking” Sarah quickly added.<br />
<br />
“Okay” Jessica responded and moving her hand slightly stuck a finger through one of the leg holes of the garment. Thomas whined and gave a slight involuntary kick when her invasive finger accidently bushed the underside of his testicles, his cheek turning a faint red from the unexpected contact. “Oops sorry there Luke” she quickly apologized as she removed her finger, “He’s dry Sarah, totally clean diaper.”<br />
<br />
“Ah well, it will happen when it happens. Thanks for doing that by the way” Sarah said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“No problem.”<br />
<br />
“So what brings you by anyway?” Sarah asked with Thomas being glad they were finally getting to the point.<br />
<br />
“Oh right, well I got the coming weekend off and I was seeing if you wanted to do something together. But now I see you got your hands full with this little guy here.” Jessica then smiled, “Hey I know, why don’t I come over and help you babysit?” she proposed and Thomas paled slightly at the thought.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if that’s such a good idea Jess” she replied knowing that Thomas specifically didn’t want any company over for the first week of him being a toddler again, the exact amount of time his trip alibi was to hold up. “I’ll have to run it by Thomas first.”<br />
<br />
“You said Thomas was going to be gone for a week so why can’t I come over? You know you don’t have to answer to his every beck and call you know.”<br />
<br />
“Well he is my employer and it is his house I’m staying in so yeah I kinda of do” Sarah playfully shot back.<br />
<br />
Jessica laughed, “Fine, fine, just give me a call later if rich boy says its okay to come over.”<br />
<br />
“Will do, you take care Jess” Sarah waved at her friend as she started to walk away.<br />
<br />
“Bye Sarah, and bye Luke” she called back.<br />
<br />
Once the door was closed Thomas breathed a sigh of relief, “Thank goodness that’s over with. I was afraid you were going to talk forever.” Sarah gave her charge an apologetic smile, “Yeah sorry about that Thomas, but I had no idea she was going to drop by like that” she said in her defense. “It’s alright, but can I get some food. I really hungry now” Thomas replied his stomach now starting to hurt a little.<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s right. I was about to feed your lunch when the doorbell. Sorry, let’s get you fed right away.”<br />
<br />
Without any further delay Sarah carried the toddler to the kitchen and set him down in a chair that had a boaster seat. In front of him was a plate with three pb & j sandwiches that were cut up into fours. Thomas licked his lips at the sight of his tasty meal which was a timeless classic that was just as beloved by adults as it was children. As he eagerly started to dig in Sarah asked him, “Would you like your milk in a bottle or sippy cup?”<br />
<br />
“Bottle” he answered through a mouthful of sandwich. Sarah nodded and promptly returned a minute later with a baby bottle filled to the brim with milk. Taking it from her and holding it in both hands he stuck the nipple in him mouth and greedily guzzled down the white liquid inside. Not only was it cool and refreshing but the milk helped to wash down the sticky peanut butter in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Alternating between his plate and bottle he made quick work of the sandwiches, eating every single one and filling his tummy up. Sitting back in his seat Thomas contently suckled from his bottle while Sarah sat down to eat her own meal. As he sucked down the last few mouthfuls of milk Thomas became aware of a spreading warmness between his legs. Confused for a moment he then realized that he was wetting himself and just like back at the clinic he had no control nor did he feel the urge to go. Thinking it was about time he had an accident Thomas smiled happily behind his bottle as he continued to empty his bladder by peeing into his pamper. It was such a rush to feel his urine just shoot out of him like that and get soaked up by his diaper. Once he was done making pee pee in his underwear he then finished off his bottle and let out a satisfying burp that drew Sarah’s attention.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you’re all done. Good job Thomas for eating all of your food” she praised her baby boy as she took the empty container from him and set it on the table.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, can you help me down. I want to go watch some cartoons” Thomas said holding up his arms.<br />
<br />
Sarah quickly responded to his request and sat him down, the toddler quickly running off the second his feet touched the floor.<br />
<br />
“You have fun now!” she called out to the fleeing one and a half year old.<br />
<br />
Truthfully the real reason Thomas ran out of the kitchen was so that Sarah wouldn’t see that he had wet his diaper. He didn’t want her to change him so soon after going potty as he wanted to enjoy his freshly soaked padding for a while longer. Once Thomas was out of sight of Sarah he looked down to see his pamper had a large yellow spot on the front, in addition to being bloated and drooping slightly between his legs. Giving it a playfully poke Thomas lightly giggled when it let out a squish. Excited at the prospect of his wet diaper he toddled over to and climbed onto to the couch before sitting down on his damp padded behind with another squish.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the remote Thomas turned on the giant flat screen tv switching to the nickelodeon channel and finding that Spongebob was on. He watched that for an hour before changing to disney junior when he checked the guide and saw that the Lion Guard. The Lion King was one of his favorite animated movies and he was a big fan of the show which was oriented towards children, all the more perfect given his new age. As he enjoyed the show Thomas laid down on his back, adopting the diaper changing position and tilting his head to the side in order to continue watching the characters on the screen. Sticking his thumb in his mouth and sucking on it he was totally absorbed in the adventure of Kion and his friends. Though not too distracted to feel a familiar warmth on his crotch as he peed himself for the second time since lunch.<br />
<br />
Despite already being wet his padding dutifully soaked up the veritable flood he unleashed. His pampers now sagging considerably Thomas raised and kicked his legs in excitement. And feeling a little horny he reached down and generously rubbed the front of the warm pee filled garment, overjoyed at the sensation of having so much liquid taped around his waist in the form of a drenched soggy diaper.<br />
<br />
Eventually the novelty of a wet diaper wore off and Thomas was ready to be changed into a new one.<br />
<br />
The only matter was how to summon Sarah to come perform it.</p>
