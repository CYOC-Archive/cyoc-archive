<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James woke up and stretched his arms wide. He rolled in his sheets, feeling super comfortable. His sense of touch seemed to be heightened as he felt the blankets cover his skin. He got up and checked his phone. There were a ton of messages, but James didn&#39;t feel the energy to look through them right now. He decided to shower, and walked over to the room across the hall from his bedroom. James looked himself over in the mirror. Odd, he looked smaller than usual. He shrugged it off and got in the shower and turned the heat up close to the max.<br />
<br />
James was lathering shampoo in his hands and then put it in his hair. He felt like he had more hair than usual, but that was a silly thought. You couldn&#39;t just grow hair in the shower! As he watched the suds fall down from his hair to the shower floor he saw they were a distinct pink color. Was his hair dye coming out already? James was confused for a moment, he didn&#39;t dye his hair, right? He thought about it, but obviously hair couldn&#39;t be pink normally so he had to have dyed it! James grabbed the bar of soap and started rubbing his body with it. The bar of soap felt amazing on his body. His skin was still super sensitive to touch. It felt like a thousand hands were rubbing over his body and James was loving it. They tweaked at every part, and made adjustments to his body as he cleaned himself up. Soon he couldn&#39;t take the pleasure anymore and creamed right against the shower wall, letting a little shriek go as he did. James, now all cleaned up, was mortified that he just did that... Still, it felt so good. He grabbed the shower head and sprayed it down, cleaning the wall before washing all the suds off of himself and getting out of the shower. <br />
<br />
James got out and dried off with the pink towel that laid beside him. He then walked over to the mirror and checked himself out. He looked so cute! His face was so adorable with the way it was rounded off, and his body was so lean and clean with no hair in sight anywhere. He struck a pose and admired his looks. Of course, he wasn&#39;t totally ready to go out yet. He grabbed the pile of clothing off the counter and looked it over. He couldn&#39;t remember putting them there... There was a really skimpy piece of underwear, kind of like a speedo, there was a pair of booty shorts, and a tank top? Were these his? A calming sensation went over James. This was his apartment after all, the clothing had to be his. He put the clothing on and saw that it fit him perfectly and accentuated just the right parts of his body. He then reached into a drawer and grabbed some hair gel, styling his pink locks into a cute fauxhauk.<br />
<br />
He walked out, fully dressed, back into his room, not noticing that it had miraculously been cleaned and organized. Posters of cute boy bands adorned the walls along with gay pride posters and some other assorted things among the pink wallpaper. He grabbed his phone and saw some messages from Grindr. He was shocked, James wanted to meet someone without an app! Still, he couldn&#39;t ignore these messages. He opened it up and it went straight to his profile: twinkboi69. The description was crude: &quot;Jamie!! fun lovin bottom lookin 4 sum fun, message me wit ur size n we can meet up ;P&quot;. He saw a message from a heartthrob boy, with a killer smile and a sexy bod asking him to meet up tonight. Jamie checked the profile and saw that his dick was huge! He&#39;d love to have that one in him. Jamie eagerly invited the boy over for the night after he was done his shift at the hair salon. Thinking about that, he put on a pair of flip-flops and decided it was time to get to work. He lived nearby, so he would walk. He put on a pair of shades and swishily walked his way to his new workplace.<br />
<br />
As he walked in, Jamie set up shop like it was any other day, not knowing that this was the first time he&#39;d ever set foot in the salon. Still, he spoke to his coworkers like he knew them forever. He practically had, the serum had a strange way of altering reality to make the stereotype come true. Jamie chatted it up with all his clients, exchanging gossip and making them look their absolute most fabulous. Quickly the day had ended, and Jamie closed up his workspace and went back to the apartment.<br />
<br />
It was practically time. Jamie grabbed a quick bite to eat, just an apple, and the boy came over soon after he was finished. Jamie flirted with the boy by grinding right up on him and making sexual innuendos, and it was apparent that the more masculine gay guy was into it. They made their way to Jamie&#39;s bedroom and started to strip. Some quick foreplay happened and soon the boy was pounding Jamie&#39;s ass. Jamie grinded right back on the boy as his hypersensitive feeling returned from being fucked. Jamie was loving it, and as the rhythm got faster he was losing his mind in ecstasy. After what both seemed like a long time and no time at all, the boy came right into Jamie&#39;s ass, and Jamie came as well. The boy whispered in Jamie&#39;s ear what a good fuck he was before pulling him into his arms where they cuddled all night.</p>
