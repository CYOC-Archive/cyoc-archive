<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn’t take long for the serum to take effect. Both officers’ blood boiled as the vile chemical circulated around their bloodstreams. They produced choked cries of pain and fear as they felt the serum get to work.<br />
<br />
Jenkins smiled as the first visible changes began. Both officers steadily developed pointed horse ears which began to shift to the tops of their heads, while the growing nubs of their forming tails pressed uncomfortably against their uniforms as they grew from their backsides. Both grimaced as their numb fingers and toes slowly began to merge into new hooves. Their clothes became increasingly strained as large swelling overtook their bodies, especially in relation to their bellies and hindquarters.<br />
<br />
It was at this stage that Jenkins cut the robes binding the distraught officers. After all, they were already too deformed and gripped by pain to make any serious escape attempt.<br />
<br />
With the bonds removed, both transformations were able to progress at a faster pace. The pair’s bodies continued to swell while their limps painfully reformed in preparation for four-legged travel. In fact it wasn’t long before officer Georgina lost her balance and toppled on to her now fully-formed front hooves. This was followed by a painful popping sound as her hips realigned for a quadrupedal stance.<br />
<br />
“Yes that’s it” Jenkins teased “soon you’ll be fit for the stud farm. Oh I foresee that you two will churn out many fine foals indeed.”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing these twisted comments Mark redoubled his efforts to fight back, he wouldn’t wind up on some bloody horse farm! Miraculously he had managed to remain on two hooves though he was wobbling dramatically as he tried to keep his balance. Jenkins chuckled “your stubbornness is impressive Mark. However, I suspect your next change will help you realise your new role in life.”<br />
<br />
As if goaded on by Jenkins’ words, the most dramatic change so far started to warp Mark’s body. The resolute officer suddenly began to feel queasy as he felt a tingle between his legs. His eyes then shot open in shock as he felt his cock and balls slowly move back between his still-changing legs. His whole body trembled as strange sensations wracked his genitals. He shuddered as he felt his scrotum stretch and contort as it shifted around beneath his tail. The skin formed a fleshy mound before it separated to form a long slit down the centre. The flesh to the side of this new opening began to swell and puff outwards while the officer’s shaft slowly receded. Mark’s manhood gradually dwindled away until the remnants of what was once his cockhead ended up nestled between the plump new growths. Mark felt uneasy as he felt new parts of his anatomy forming inside him. Mark hated to admit it but he knew exactly what had happened; he now had an equine vagina!<br />
<br />
As Jenkins had predicted, this latest horrific revelation proved too much for Mark to handle. The concentration that had kept the officer on two feet for so long dissipated in an instant. Mark’s hooves noisily clopped to the ground as he joined his colleague on all-fours. His hips then adjusted themselves with a loud crunch, making his body better-suited for four-legged travel, and for being mounted of course. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, officer Georgina had been less successful in resisting her changes. Her own sex had changed a while ago now. In fact everything below her neck was now truly mare-like. Her uniform had been reduced to rags as her chest and backside had finally reached full mare proportions. A beautiful dapple grey coat had settled over her save for the bits that still needed to change.<br />
<br />
Jenkins watched the changes with satisfaction, pleased with how potent his new equine serum was. Jenkins then remembered that the horny stallion was still in the room with them, and he also seemed to be transfixed by the transformations. Jenkins hurriedly ordered for someone to take the excited stallion away quickly. After all, he had promised his client that he would deliver the broodmares to the stud farm ‘intact.’<br />
<br />
In fact Jenkins wouldn’t have to wait long for his new broodmares to be complete. Officer Georgina was almost done now. Her neck had lengthened and developed more muscle, whilst her human voice had been replaced by that of a horse. Now Jenkins watched in glee as her pretty face stretched out into an equine muzzle. The officer whinnied sorrowfully as the last of her humanity drifted away. The changes finished as the horse’s protests died down; Georgina was now a beautiful dapple grey broodmare.<br />
<br />
Mark wasn’t too far off the finish either. His distressed cries had steadily morphed into shrill whinnies as his voice box was gripped by the sick transformation. Mark’s mare body looked similar to that of his colleague. The same dapple grey fur covered him from head to tail. Two rubbery nipples now poked out between his hind legs, thus cementing his change of gender. Internally Mark’s resistance was waning. He stomped his hooves and whinnied in protest but if anything this just reminded him what he was becoming. <br />
<br />
Mark felt that defeat was imminent as the changes steadily crept over his face. He gave a last few defiant whinnies before the changes reached their conclusion. He, or more accurately she, was now a broodmare as well, ideal for the stud farm.<br />
<br />
Jenkins clapped as the commotion finally settled down. He then moved to inspect his latest acquisitions, checking to make sure they were ready for the stud farm. He moved around Georgina, inspecting her elegant equine features. He made sure she had the equipment needed to be a true broodmare; both between her legs and under her tail. He was pleased to see that Georgina’s vagina had already started to moisten, a sign that she had entered heat as intended.<br />
<br />
Jenkins then repeated the process for Mark. He caressed and patted the elegant mare as he admired his work. He reached beneath her to check she possessed the correct female assets. She then lifted Mark’s tail and was delighted to see similar tell-tale signs of a mare coming into season.<br />
<br />
“Brilliant!” He announced. “You’re gorgeous. I’m sure you’ll both fetch a high price.” Both horses just snorted dumbly, completely oblivious to what was being said.“Haha glad you agree! Now before we get you loaded up we need a new name for you Mark, after all, that name isn’t exactly feminine. Hmmm… I suppose Marcia is the female equivalent.” The formerly-male officer neighed happily. “Well that’s that settled then!”<br />
<br />
With that, Jenkins patted both mares on the rump before a pair of attendants came to collect them. The two new horses were then loaded into a horsebox and taken towards their new lives as broodmares at the local stud farm.<br />
<br />
Jenkins smiled as he waved them off. Now the real fun could begin…</p>
