<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
&quot;Um, sure, &quot; mumbled Carl as he opened the door wide and backed up.<br />
<br />
The zebra girl clomped in, her hips swaying seductively as her hooves loudly clicked on the floor.  She smiled and ran her soft hands under his chin as she walked past him. Carl found himself looking up at her, not realizing how much taller she was until she passed by him. She looked around the room as she walked towards the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nice room.  But then again, I haven&#39;t been up here in a while.  Hasn&#39;t been much call for me sadly,&quot; she said with a sigh as she sat down on the bed and crossed her legs. It creaked a little under the weight of her body, but held firm. She rhythmically kicked her leg restlessly, and Carl couldn&#39;t help but stare at her foot, which was nothing more than hoof really.<br />
<br />
The girl coughed, drawing his attention back to her face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Radya, by the way, &quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Carl couldn&#39;t help but stare at her face.   It looked so odd.  It resembled a zebra with the striped muzzle ending in a black tipped mouth, but seemed a little shorter than a real zebra.  Her pointy ears were positioned on the top of her head.  But they were lost in a tangle of very human looking hair, a long black and white mane that extended behind her head.  Her eyes looked human, too, as well as her mouth.  It could form human expressions.....an expression Carl recognized.<br />
<br />
Frustration.  She lifted her eyebrows expectantly, obviously waiting for him to do something.  But what? Carl was still shocked that such a creature existed, much less was in his hotel room. How was he supposed to great this creature?  Did he pat its head like he had with the dog girl? He thought he remembered that you were supposed to let horses sniff your hand, then rub their muzzle.  Was it the same for Zebras?  He was just about to give up when it hit him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, my name is Carl.  Nice to meet you, &quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
Radya nodded her approval and Carl sighed. All she had wanted was his name and a simple greeting, just like any person would.  These creatures may look different, but they did have the same feelings and thoughts as human beings.  He began to relax a little ...... until Radya began to undress, removing what little clothes she had on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Carl. Nice to meet you.  Now we need to get started.  Unfortunately we don&#39;t have much time, so we better make the most of it.  How do you want to do this?&quot; she asked, now completely nude.<br />
<br />
Well, except for her fur.  But that didn&#39;t hide her large breasts with pert black nipples and the large thick black labia lining her exposed vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know ..... I don&#39;t think...&quot; stuttered Carl as he blushed bright red.  He wasn&#39;t sure what he had expected when he ordered a zebra girl from room service, but he sure didn&#39;t expect this.  He was trying to think of a polite way to explain the situation without offending her.<br />
<br />
Radya smiled and stood up off the bed, stomping over to him and wagging her hips.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, a shy boy.  I like that.  But don&#39;t worry.  I know what I am doing.  I&#39;ll walk you through it.  We&#39;ll start slow, &quot; said Radya, as she pulled him close to her body.  Carl could feel her soft fur and warm body pressing against his own.  His face was trapped between her generous breasts. He felt his erection slowly rise.  &quot;That&#39;s a good boy. Now let&#39;s see what we are working with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radya quickly bent down and unbuckled his pants, roughly pulling them down to his ankles. Carl backed away, tripping over the pants wrapped around his ankles. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no!  You don&#39;t understand.  I don&#39;t think I can.  I don&#39;t I am able!  I mean, you are very pretty and all.  But I just don&#39;t think we are compatible.  I mean, our bodies are just too different. You are just so... so much bigger, &quot; rambled Carl, trying to properly explain himself.<br />
<br />
Staring at her large genitalia Carl felt his relatively small penis wilt.  Radya stared at him, raising one eyebrow quizzically.  She ran one hand under her chin, deep in thought.  Carl couldn&#39;t help but stare at that hand.  It had just three digits and thumb, the tip of each ending in a hard black nail as thick as a hoof.  Finally her eyes brightened as she seemed to get an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got it.  Just the thing to help get you going,&quot; she said with excitement.  She walked back to the bed and began to dig through the small red handbag she had brought with her. Curious, Carl stood up and waddled over to the bed to see what she was doing. &quot;Now, you have to keep this a secret.  We aren&#39;t supposed to share this with the guests.  But I think this is just what you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radya pulled out a large syringe filled with an amber liquid.  She pushed the plunger, squirting a few drops out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; Carl asked with fear, backing away a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I can&#39;t tell you that. It&#39;s a super big secret.  But I can tell you what it will do. It will give you the biggest, hardest erection you ever had in your life.  Then we won&#39;t have to worry about your little problem and we can get down to business,&quot; said Radya with a smile.<br />
<br />
Carl was upset.  His dick wasn&#39;t little!  At least not by human standards.  And he had never had a problem getting it up.  He sure as hell didn&#39;t need any weird locally made herbal version of Viagra.<br />
<br />
Radya sensed his apprehension.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we don&#39;t have to do anything.  I am not going to force you to do something against your will. We can just sit and talk until my time is up if you like.  But you are the one who called me.  I thought you wanted to have some fun.  I sure do, I&#39;ll tell you that.  Don&#39;t you want to be adventurous, try something new and exotic? I promise you&#39;ll enjoy it.  I am very good and I have never had any complaints.  Come on, live a little,&quot; said Radya, as she rubbed his legs.<br />
<br />
Carl sighed.  Radya&#39;s words really hit him where it counted.  He had come here to try new things and be a little bold.  This wasn&#39;t exactly what he had planned, but Radya was attractive in a strange kind of way.  And it was his vacation after all.  He needed to be a little bold and daring.  Radya had promised he wouldn&#39;t regret it.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe he should wait a little.  He never had a one night stand, much less used a prostitute.  It felt wrong just to have sex with someone he had just met.  Maybe he should spend some time with Radya and get to know more about her before he did anything rash.  <br />
<br />
He looked at the needle in her hands, the light almost sparkling through the amber fluid.  Although he was nervous, the promise of &#39;the largest, hardest erection he ever had&#39; was tempting.  If he was going to do something crazy, might as well go all the way.  Or perhaps it would be better to use his own equipment.  It seemed safer, and he could prove to Radya that he didn&#39;t need any chemical help to please a woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, honey.  Make up your mind.  Time is wasting, &quot; said Radya impatiently, looking up at him from the bed.</p>
