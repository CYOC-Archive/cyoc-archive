<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, where are you gonna go,&quot; Freed asked, breaking the silence. The group had met in a restaurant to have one more meal together before they split up tomorrow. They were trying to enjoy themselves, but everyone&#39;s minds were on their own thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh,&quot; started Jack as he shook himself free of his deep thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m heading back home to Elgrheim. It&#39;s far to the northeast just below the Taranis mountains. You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve decided to head home too. It&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve seen my village,&quot; Freed leaned backwards in his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it like? Your home I mean,&quot; Beverly leaned forward. <br />
<br />
Freed thought about it for a moment. &quot;Kinda how you would imagine a typical village I guess. Trees are allowed to grow closer to the houses to provide shade. A few farms are along the road to my village. Oh, and the gnomes set up a tinker shop around the time I left.&quot;<br />
Beverly noticed how talking about the good parts of home seemed to brighten Freed&#39;s mood and the others were listening in with interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have gnomes in your village,&quot; Sara asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, gnomes, elves, dwarves, halflings, all kinds of races. Kinda like here...guess that&#39;s why I feel so comfortable in the capital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just had humans in my village,&quot; explained Sara, &quot;well, besides me I guess. It&#39;s not very far west, still a 2 day wagon ride. I wonder if I should fly the distance,&quot; Sara flexed her wings slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Vect? What&#39;s your home like,&quot; Freed leaned forward to look at Vect.<br />
<br />
&quot;My home is in the southern province of the high elf empire and its probably what you expect. Non-elves are an uncommon sight. Hells, I didn&#39;t see my first non-elf until I came here. It was quiet, peaceful, the commoners were friendly and I could wander the town without an escort.&quot; Vect looked upward as he recalled more memories, &quot;we had a river run through the center of the town and boats would come and go often, bringing things from far away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a nice place,&quot; Lelu smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess it does...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Vesper by the way,&quot; Lelu looked around the restaurant. &quot;Wasn&#39;t he going to travel with you Freed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is escorting Neisha home. Her guards died during the attack and asked him to escort her as a last wish, but Dolph Remly asked to come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The trainee paladin? Why,&quot; Sara raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Freed shrugged. &quot;He just said he needed to clear his head and get away from the capital for a while. Plus it will be nice to not travel alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they continued to talk about their homes, Vect leaned over to whisper into her ear. &quot;Meet me by the skydocks later. Pier 4.&quot; Sara wanted to ask why, but knew there must be a reason why Vect didn&#39;t want the others to know and just resumed the conversation.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Vect watched as the sky ships came and went from the elevated platforms. Save the ribbed wings jutting out the side of the craft and lack of sails, one could mistake them for their water bound counterparts. Their hulls held aloft by magic either woven into the very wood itself, emanated from an enchanted crystal, or from the aid of a deal with an air elemental. He spotted the &#39;Absolute&#39; in the docks bristling with activity to prepare for its departure tomorrow morning. Its crew, along with a few other sky ships, had boldly joined in with the fighting in the skies with the &#39;Absolute&#39; being one of the more successful, and more damaged. It was only now that its repairs were finished, and just in time for it to take him back home. <br />
<br />
Vect looked out over the cityscape before him. Windows glowed from inner lamps being lit as the daylight faded. <br />
<br />
&quot;They almost looks like stars don&#39;t they,&quot; Sara said suddenly, startling Vect from his sightseeing with a jump. &quot;Hehehe,&quot; Sara giggled, &quot;how can I sneak up on you with those ears? Hey what&#39;s that?&quot; She motioned to his hands.<br />
<br />
Vect held up a shard of metal he had been fiddling with in his hands. A fragment of his sword, the one Ebron the dwarven blacksmith had given to him. &quot;He wasn&#39;t happy about me bringing him his work in pieces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can it be fixed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not likely, but he suggested I hold on to the pieces anyway just in case I come across someone who can repair it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you doing up here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vect sighed and leaned against the railing, &quot;just thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About leaving tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Vect had run through his head what he was going to say dozens of times, but now that he was here the words caught in his throat. &quot;S- Sara there&#39;s something I need to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...?&quot;<br />
<br />
(What my partner is failing to say), Erress explained, her voice suddenly speaking in both their heads, (Is that there is something inside him, inside us, that is dangerous and-)<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll handle this Erress,&quot; Vect interrupted. He looked at Sara and his expression softened, &quot;no she&#39;s right. If I lose control again I don&#39;t want anyone to get hurt, especially you. That&#39;s why I can&#39;t make any promises about coming back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Sara felt her heart racing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I&#39;m trying to say,&quot; he paused as he struggled to say what he wanted to say. &quot;Don&#39;t wait for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara stared at Vect in silence for a few moments before she suddenly reached out and slapped him on the cheek. &quot;Idiot!&quot;<br />
It was clear from his shocked expression that he wasn&#39;t expecting this outcome at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t wait for me.&#39; Really?! What cliche book did you pull that one out of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh I uh,&quot; he stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here,&quot; Sara grabbed the front of his tunic and pulled him closer, &quot;I know how you feel. I couldn&#39;t bear to see me hurt you, but we can figure this out together. 2 heads are better than one right?&quot; Her fierce expression softened, &quot;and I also know the rest will gladly offer to help you, especially Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I need to return home to sort out my problems there and you need to see your village too,&quot; Vect was grasping for a reasonable argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will. It&#39;s just a few months. If you can solve this problem on your own in that time by all means, but come September I expect to see you back here with us and we&#39;ll all sort this out together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sara I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Don&#39;t deserve me?&#39;,&quot; she put one finger to his lips to silence him and smiled. &quot;Just remember to be back here by September or I&#39;m coming to get you myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vect pulled her into an embrace and held it for a while in silence before whispering, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They pulled apart from each other. &quot;Let&#39;s head back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lelu is rubbing off on you, you know,&quot; Vect rubbed his stinging cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Call it a little revenge for the arena.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; he chuckled.<br />
<br />
They left the docks hand in hand.</p>
