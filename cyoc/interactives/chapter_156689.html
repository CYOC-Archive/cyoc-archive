<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tricia eyed the tail nub as it grew into a horse&#39;s tail, quickly sliding out from the tiny amount of material in Amber&#39;s bikini, then opening up, like a flower in a fast-motion video coming to full bloom.  Amber normally tended to keep her hair cut short, but the contrast here was obvious as the hair sprouting from her tail was a luxurious jet black that would be at least a couple of feet long when she stood.  Somehow, it didn&#39;t completely match the hair on her head, but it was pretty close in color, perhaps a little thicker.<br />
<br />
Amber was still asleep, oblivious to the change, and didn&#39;t even seem aware when the tail started idly to move, or even when its hair started brushing against the back of her bare legs.<br />
<br />
As Tricia looked over her friend, trying to think what would happen when Amber awoke to the change with her standing next to her, she looked more closely at the buttons of the remote, then figured out that what looked like a flat surface over the bottom two thirds was more like a screen protector.  She slid it off, and saw a screen, menu-driven, that had a lot more options, including buttons to go up to other menus, and down to more detailed ones.<br />
<br />
She went down further into the horse tail menu, with the app showing she had descended from several levels into ...>Tail>Horse, and saw options for hair color, texture, volume, length, size, even one for invisibility.  So, it seems the buttons on the top part of the remote were shortcuts.<br />
<br />
She looked at the buttons and the app, and tried to get more of an idea how to work this.  Amber wasn&#39;t going to sleep forever, and this was suddenly a lot to take in.  She had to know more right away.  She clicked in the app part of the remote to go up to a higher level, and she was into the Tail menu, showing ...>Body Parts>Tail.  That Body Parts menu would be interesting, not to mention what was above that in the menus list, but that had to wait for now.  She scrolled through a long list, stopping every so often at the different entries, trying to see what this could do...Aardvark...Bird...Centaur...Cow...Dog...Goat...Horse...Human...Naga...Phoenix...Rabbit...Satyr...Snake...Sphinx...Squirrel...Zebra.  Tricia had been scrolling for a couple of minutes, caught up in seeing this list, and realizing she better not dawdle.  <br />
<br />
Again, she looked down at Amber&#39;s sleeping form.  Still lying flat on her tummy, unmoving, just taking in the sun.  Tricia wondered to herself what was the difference between a centaur tail and a horse&#39;s tail, according to this device...after all, centaurs didn&#39;t exist, right?  It should just be a horse&#39;s tail.  Well, Amber was still asleep, and it was worth knowing what the remote could do, so she scrolled back up, went into the Tail>Centaur, and pointed at Amber.  The tail actually changed.  The hair looked finer, a little straighter as if it had been habitually managed, yet it was fuller, and a lot more like the hair on Amber&#39;s head...human hair on a horse&#39;s tail, perhaps.  And the centaurs of mythology were half-human, half-horse.  Tricia had to think.  A human tail, a coccyx, was a hidden bone, painful if you broke it, but humans did have tails.  But, they&#39;d be hidden.  If this worked as she guessed, that would be how to restore Amber.  Or anyone.  But, that wasn&#39;t what was going to happen just yet.  And she decided on what she was going to do next with Amber.  And herself.  She put the cap back on over the screen part of the remote.<br />
<br />
She moved in front of Amber and squatted down.  As she gently nudged her shoulders, she said, &quot;Hey, sleepy head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, yourself...what&#39;s up?&quot; Amber, replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I saw you over here, and was going to come over anyway to say hello, when I felt something at my feet in the sand.  I was a little clumsy picking it up and think I pressed something, because it was pointed at you and now you have a big, long horse&#39;s tail,&quot; said Tricia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try, Tricia.  You may as well tell me I grew in a dick while you were at it, but much as either might be interesting, you know what they say, &#39;if wishes were horses, we&#39;d be riding each other already.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia&#39;s jaw dropped slightly.  She controlled the impulse to say something too impulsive.  &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to know how hot you look.  And, yes, I would so totally want to do you if the equipment was right.  Just bein&#39; honest.  I haven&#39;t figured out that part of things yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Tricia went further behind Amber, took Amber&#39;s tail in one hand, held it gently, and started stroking it.  &quot;Would you like to start figuring it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber finally got up on her right side to turn around and look at her...her tail.  And what Tricia was doing really felt good.  Arousing.  Exciting.  She shivered on this hot day, and the shiver went down to her tail, which she first moved with the unconscious motion of the shiver, then consciously twitched it as it was stimulated.  &quot;Um.  Wow.  I.  Oh, that feels good.  Yeah, are you saying we should figure this out together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I definitely am.  And, if I&#39;m hot, you&#39;re hotter.  And that tail is sexy.  Whatever this thing is, let&#39;s find out.  I think this is going to be fun.  But, let&#39;s get you home without too much attention.  Can we pick things up, and you can hide the tail under the beach towels?  Sorry if this stops you getting an even tan, but I think we might have other things to figure out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Amber replied.  &quot;Let&#39;s put my stuff into this basket.  I&#39;ll cover up this new addition.  Oh my god I have a tail!  Let&#39;s get your stuff together, and...your apartment ok?  My dorm room won&#39;t be quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good.  Meet you at my place as soon as we can get there.&quot;</p>
