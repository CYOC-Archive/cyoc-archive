<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">According to the clock on the bedside table it was almost 9 when I awoke, but Philip was still fast asleep, his titanic form wrapped around me like a shield. I gently stroked his muscles, tracing the roadmap of veins that covered his biceps and feeling his monstrous pecs press into me with each breath.<br />
<br />
I was so in love, it was incredible the feeling. And we&#39;d only known each other a day.<br />
<br />
Gradually my thoughts turned less than pure as my hands moved down his abs. Hey, you try waking up cuddling a 350lb, 7 foot tall hunk of man without a raging hard on!<br />
<br />
As I moved my hand under the sheets that had pooled at his waste, my breath quickened with anticipation at what I might find. Although he was still asleep, Philip was sporting at least a partial hard from what I could feel. I gently massaged him into a full salute, feeling the warm flesh grow and harden in my hand, and frowned a bit.<br />
<br />
I had made Philip fairly well hung by most standards, certainly by his former proportions, but I wanted more. Philip deserved more.<br />
<br />
I turned in his arms and pushed myself up to gently kiss him awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmph, Francis.&quot; He murmured, a sleepy smile on his face as he lazily gazed back at me. &quot;Good morning beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
I responded by pressing a little more urgently into him, one hand cupping his face while the other slowly traced up and down his hard cock. I pushed him into his back, lying on top of his godly body. Hey, he may have outweighed me by a hundred pounds but my &quot;little&quot; 209 could get the job done. Plus, he was offering up no resistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, Francis.&quot; He hummed as I began to kiss along his jaw, then sucked marks on his thick neck, then moved down the deep valley his pecs created. The yelp he let out when I pinched his swollen nipples went strait to my rapidly hardening cock. I smiled coyly at him as I licked a line right down his abs before flinging back the sheets, allowing his hard shaft to spring up in the morning air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Philip, baby.&quot; I purred. &quot;Look at you, you&#39;re all ready for me.&quot; He let out a moan as I cupped each of his balls. &quot;With these big, bad boys, the size of big grapefruits.&quot;<br />
<br />
My breath hitched as his balls swelled huge, filling my hands to where I had to use both to hold one. &quot;So pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you like those Francis baby? You like feeling my huge nuts?&quot; He smirked at me but I could see how all this playing was making him slowly unravel. I loved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I do stud. Almost as much as I love deep throating that massive cock they come with. All 18 rock hard inches of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The change was immediate. His 9 inches doubling in size, both length and girth, until it was a throbbing tower of thick, veiny flesh begging to be serviced.<br />
<br />
I was openly drooling and I didn&#39;t care as I ran my hands up and down it. &quot;So big, and hard, and so, so very sensitive.&quot; I smirked at that last one, especially when I heard Philips breath catch and shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn baby, keep doing that. Little Phil likes that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Phil?&quot; I raised an eyebrow. &quot;What&#39;s so little about him? Certainly not the giant loads he spews, of the fact that you&#39;ve got to order special posers for bodybuilding competitions so you don&#39;t burst right through them on stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well, what can I say? With a body like this you gotta have a cock to match it.&quot; He winked and flexed a Herculean bicep at me. My cock throbbed painfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he&#39;s called &quot;little&quot; because of how quickly he recharges after cumming. It&#39;s almost instantaneous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t shut up you&#39;re gonna find out about that first hand.&quot; Philip moaned as he clutched the sheets, his cock starting to fountain sweet pre. With little more than a smirk for a warning, I put my mouth on his cock head and started slurping, deep throating all of him until my nose was pressing against his pelvis, just like I said I could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, aw, aw yeah baby! Fuck Francis, oh fuck yes. Here I go.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a cry of pleasure I felt his tool dump its sweet payload into my stomach, feeling it puff out slightly at the shear volume of cum. I pulled off of him with a &#39;pop&#39;. He was still rock solid and glistening with saliva.<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn.&quot; He smiled darkly as he rose and pushed me onto my back, his beautiful cock slapping his abs just below his plump pecs. &quot;You ready stud? You think you can handle this fucking huge cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, oh please baby. I can take it.&quot; I whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; And with no further warning, he lined his cock up and rammed me good, pushing all the way in with one thrust.<br />
<br />
The feeling of Philips cock in my ass was amazing, fitting so perfectly. As if the two were made especially for each other, just like Philip was truly made for me.<br />
<br />
Literally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god yes, fucking yes baby! Oh god Phil, fill me up, make me yours, make me feel like you&#39;re gonna split me in two!&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess that was enough for my powers because all of a sudden the muscles in my ass seemed to contract and it felt as though Philips mighty cock was trying to do just that.<br />
<br />
My brain exploded. It was the most fucking incredible thing I&#39;d ever felt in my life! The sounds that came out of my mouth could barely be described as human and the grunts from Philip were just plain animalistic.<br />
<br />
I shot my load three times before I became aware of Phil saying actual words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god baby, I&#39;m close, I&#39;m so fucking close! Oh fuck get ready!<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful stud, our you&#39;re gonna get me pregnant.&quot; I joked, preparing for the rush of semen that was coming. No pun intended.<br />
<br />
Instead, just as I knew he was about to shoot, he suddenly pulled all the way out, leaving me gaping and empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;FFFFUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!!&quot; He bellowed loud enough to shake the windows as his cock let loose an intensely powerful spray, shooting volley after volley of hot man seed clear across the room, splattering against the wall like a Jackson Pollock.<br />
<br />
He collapsed on the bed next to me, his cock slowly deflating and his beautiful body covered in sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell Philip? Why did you pull out?&quot; I shot him a look. Well, as much of a look as I could muster after having had my very brains fucked out.<br />
<br />
He kissed me tenderly with apology in his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Francis, I didn&#39;t want to, believe me. But I don&#39;t have any condoms that will fit me and no morning after pills ether. I love you more than I ever thought possible, but we&#39;re still in college. We&#39;re not ready for a baby, not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at him dumbfounded for a moment before my brain recalled what I had said in a haze of fucking.<br />
<br />
He kissed me once more. &quot;Are you mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no I&#39;m not mad.&quot; I spoke slowly, still trying to wrap my head around this one. &quot;You&#39;re right, having a baby now would be irresponsible.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grinned and pulled me close. For a while we just lay there, me on top of him. Him, lazily stroking my hair, pressing kisses into the top of my head, and me, gently tracing the outline of his abs with one hand, and with the other resting on my stomach, still semi distended from the cum I&#39;d swallowed earlier, trying to wrap my head around the idea that I could apparently get pregnant with Philips child.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t actually a terrifying thought.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes Philip yawned and scratched his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced at the clock. &quot;Almost 12:00, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I&#39;ve got class at 1:00.&quot; He rose and headed for the bathroom, his naked body glinting with drying cum and sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the rush baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in case you haven&#39;t noticed, baby, I am currently covered in your cum and hickeys and as much as I&#39;d love to go out like this, I&#39;ve got to clean up. And washing this body takes a good, long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want some help with that?&quot; I smirked. &quot;It&#39;ll go faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
The grin he gave me was downright filthy. &quot;Like hell it will.&quot; He said as he picked me up and carried me into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He was very late to class.</p>
