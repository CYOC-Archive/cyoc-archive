<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gwen now neatly laid out dinner plates, Julia would be arriving any minute.<br />
<br />
Over the past couple of years the two old friends had slowly begun seeing more and more of eachother. Ever since their 10 year high school reunion, (which had led to the two women being reduced to doll sized as well as Gwen expressing her feelings for Julia,) the two had begun exploring their feelings for one another. <br />
<br />
While Gwen was an open lesbian, Julia was still struggling with the idea. Yes, Julia loved Gwen, she had even delved into a romantic relationship with the woman, she wasn&#39;t ready to commit to anything solid. Julia still loved men and since turning 30, she was beginning to think of the future.<br />
<br />
Gwen wanted those things as well, she just wanted them with Julia. This weekend, while fun, would also have some hard talks. Both women were now 30 and Gwen wanted something more stable, not just a weekend fling. Bruahing her short brown hair from her eyes she decided she would have a serious talk with Julia. After the two had some fun of course.<br />
<br />
The sound of a key turning made Gwen smile. Glancing towards the door she smiled as the statuesque blond businesswoman entered. &quot;Hey Julia,&quot; Gwen smiled. &quot;How was work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia groaned, taking a deep breath as she approached the smaller woman. &quot;It was hell,&quot; she sighed before placing a gentle kiss on her lovers cheek. &quot;Too many meetings, too many discussions about bottom lines and profit margins, and far too much office bullshit.&quot; Gwen smiled as she watched Julia remove her business jacket before draping it over a chair. &quot;Dinner smells lovely though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New recipe,&quot; Gwen said. &quot;Hope you&#39;re hungry.&quot; Julia nodded as she now made her way into the kitchen, grabbing a bottle of wine and two glasses. &quot;So,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I got us a surprise for this little weekend getaway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen raised an eyebrow as Julia now produced a small box from her purse. &quot;What is it,&quot; Gwen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Julia replied impishly. &quot;Lately I&#39;ve been thinking about us. Especially how you originally came on to me.&quot; Gwen felt her cheeks flush as she remembered confessing her feelings for Julia. The usually tall blond had been reduced to only 35 inches tall. Despondent Gwen had approached her, comforting the woman before coming on to her. Julia, at the time, had been shocked however she quickly relented. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what is it,&quot; Gwen asked quietly, her cheeks burning at the memory. Julia smiled, revealing 2 small dice. &quot;These,&quot; Julia said triumphantly. &quot;Are magic dice. I order them from a Magic shop. Supposedly they control a person&#39;s height. Was thinking we could...try them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen chuckled, shaking her head as she now gazed at Julia. &quot;Cmon you don&#39;t seriously believe that do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its just as probable as cards that make you shrink,&quot; Julia countered. &quot;Besides, I figured it could be me dominating you this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen shuddered, remembering the thought of overpowering the smaller Julia. &quot;Okay this might be fun,&quot; she said. &quot;How do they work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia smiled, placing one of the dice in Gwen&#39;s hand as she now held her own. For a moment Gwen was puzzled before gasping as her die began to glow silver. &quot;According to the instructions they&#39;re now bonded to us,&quot; Julia said, showing if her die which now glowed gold. &quot;All you have to do now is toss them and poof, you start shrinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen now gazed at her die before looking at Julia&#39;s. The power to shrink her lover out of her clothing made the woman shudder, still she remembered the trouble they had the first time. &quot;How do we get back to normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its reverses itself by morning,&quot; Julia said. As Gwen now nodded, Julia quickly grabbed her die. &quot;Hey,&quot; Gwen exclaimed. Julia simply smirked as she held it out if reach. &quot;Not so fast their Gwen,&quot; Julia grinned. &quot;You&#39;re the one that&#39;s shrinking, not me.&quot; Without another word Julia now tossed Gwen&#39;s die, watching as it landed on 3.<br />
<br />
30 years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is 27. Each roll of the die returns more of what you have lost.<br />
<br />
Gwen raised an eyebrow, what was that voice? Before she could ask she gasped as she began to glow, watching as orbs of light now floated off her body. As the lights dissipated she now examined herself. &quot;Whats was that about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia was confused, now examine her friend carefully. &quot;What the hell,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You should of shrank 3 inches. Why are you still the same size?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen shrugged, examining herself carefully. Her clothes still fit her fine, even the flats she had been wearing didnt seem any bigger yet something had happened. &quot;Beats me but something happened to me. Also what did that voice mean by 27?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia frowned, examine her own die. &quot;Let me try mine,&quot; she said. Tossing it on the table she watched as it landed on 5.<br />
<br />
30 years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is but 25. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.<br />
<br />
Now it was Julia&#39;s turn to feel the odd sensation as the orbs of light floated off her body. The statuesque woman shuddered for a moment before the lights vanished. As she now studied herself she could see the waist of her skirt seemed a bit looser yet her breasts seemed a tad perkier. &quot;Well something happened,&quot; she stated. &quot;My skirt feels looser but I&#39;m not any smaller. What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frustrated she now rolled Gwen&#39;s die once more watching as it landed on 4. More lights floating off the woman as the voice echoed, her number was now 23. As she examined herself she could see the waist of her jeans was looser than before. &quot;Something definitely happened that time,&quot; she said as she adjusted her jeans. As she now looked at Julia she noticed a look of shock on her face. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia now grabbed her friend as she dragged her to the bathroom. Flicking on the lights Gwen took a look at herself before gasping. &quot;Oh my god!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen&#39;s face was no longer the mature Visage of a woman who had recently hit 30. The qomans face was now younger, softer, rounder, Gwen had the expression of a young woman who looked fresh out of college. Touching her face she watched as the reflection did the same. &quot;Im...I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Younger,&quot; Julia finished as she now studied her face carefully. &quot;We both are! The dice didn&#39;t shrink us, they made us younger. Were back in our 20s.&quot;<br />
<br />
A now 23 and 25 year old woman now simply gawked at themselves. Shocked by what they saw and wondering if they could fix this before things got worse.</p>
