<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>More of a set up chapter for later. Going to branch out from here and do more TFs from here.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate didn&#39;t see a point to resist, at least not right now. Whatever the captain had planned if he disobeyed seemed bad, or at least worse than cleaning up after the pirates orgy. He shuddered just thinking of his new task. This cave was a mess, and he had to make sure every rock was spotless.<br />
<br />
Muttering to himself, Nate grabbed a mop and bucket and went to work. Washing away the sailor&#39;s loads, going from cell to cell and doing the finest job he could. Occasionally he had to go outside to change the water, finding that he was at the shore of some jungle island. A large ship anchored in the distance, canons at the ready and black flag visible. Some smaller rowboats were parked on the sand, with sailors loading boxes onto the vessels then rowing to the ship.<br />
<br />
The captain is no where to be found. Nate breathing a sign of relief, which is short lived as the crews eyes are upon him. The older men chuckling, a fatter sailor with clear moobs shouting &quot;Aye, Cabin Boy. Got something down here that could use some cleaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate cringes, getting fresh water then going back to the cave. Swabbing up the remaining spunk, then having a second examination of the cells just to be safe. It&#39;s practically sparkling, the captain better be happy with this.<br />
<br />
Nate washes up the supplies, dumps the dirty water, and puts his gear away. Going up to the pirates at the shore, the older pirate that talked dirty earlier being the one to greet Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, cabinboy?&quot;<br />
&quot;I cleaned the cell. Captain said he needed to see me after.&quot;<br />
&quot;Captain Strongarm said so indeed. Wait here boy, I&#39;ll check yer work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate awkwardly waited, the other pirates still staring at him with clear want. A few reached into their trousers to stroke themselves, others whistled or called to him. He couldn&#39;t believe this was going to be a regular part of his life, at least for now he could reject these pirates since he needed to see the captain. The older sailor from earlier returning, slapping a hand on the cabin boys bouncy ass, then giving it a tight squeeze. Nate winces, while simultaneously going red in the face and feeling a tightness in his pants. He didn&#39;t want to admit it, but being gripped by these older pirates felt great.<br />
<br />
&quot;Job well done, lad. Go see the captain, he&#39;ll be wanting to reward ye.&quot;<br />
&quot;T-thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
He backs away from the crew, freeing himself from the bigger pirates grasp. Seeing the hirsute and tall sailor, bald head and black beard. Two mounds of fat above his rotund stomach. Nate imagines what fun the two of them could have. Being pinned under his large gut, and having a thick cock repeatedly planted into his ass. Living the dream of any cabin boy as he keeps the crews spirits high. He temporarily hesitates, able to resist this curse as he moves one of the rowboats to the sea. Getting in and rowing towards the ship.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s hard fighting even the light waves of the sea. Nate remembers being taller and stronger. The man he once was would have no trouble sailing, but his new younger and weaker self struggles with the repetitive task. This reality quashing any hopes of rowing away from these pirates and to safety. He would surely be caught if he tries, and surely punished for his treachery. <br />
<br />
When he finally reaches the ship, the crew helps pull the boat up and welcome Nate on board. A burly man with greying hair slapping his ass and wrapping a hand around his shoulder. The cabin boy moaning from the action, as the crew mate laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome aboard, Nate. Captain Strongarm&#39;s expecting ye.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice was familiar. Nate spotting a few tattoos under the man&#39;s singlet. Swords and skulls, the realisation hitting him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darin! What-&quot;<br />
&quot;Ye recognised me! Good lad! If yer still walking after the captain&#39;s done with ye, I&#39;d love to try yer ass.&quot;<br />
&quot;O-okay Darin, well I need to see the captain first.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gulped, his friend in the cells was at least somewhat the same. Orange haired, same tattoos, same cockiness. But he spoke with the same dialect as the rest of the crew, and was as loyal to the captain as the rest. Whatever curse had afflicted him had taken over, and Nate knew he would find no ally in Darin. <br />
<br />
Heading below deck, Nate was in an opened hall where the pirates drank and laughed. Another cabin boy behind a counter, blond haired and freckled face. Thin and petite as he served the crew, and was treated to the same behaviour as Nate. Pirates patting his ass as he passed, teasing him and taunting him with their cocks. Though unlike Nate, he embraced the attention. Giggling as they groped him, kissing the crew when they demanded it. A few times he even bumped his ass against a pirates crotch. <br />
<br />
Nate finds it almost terrifying to watch. Is that what he&#39;s going to be like if this keeps up? He needs to get out before it&#39;s all too late, and he also needs to see the captain. His quarters opposite the drinking tables, dull and dim hall turning to a well furnished and well lit room. Walls adorned with plundered tapestries. Well built wooden shelves and chests lining the room, gold trimmed and shining from the light. Bed with bright red sheets and puffy pillows, it looks like it could belong to royalty. The captain laying on the bed, dressed the same as before as he looks up to his guest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye should knock first, boy.&quot;<br />
&quot;You told me to report to your quarters.&quot;<br />
<br />
That same defiance was still present in Nate. The captain more impressed than annoyed as he got to his feet. Standing a good foot taller than his subordinate, though the cabin boy kept a brave image. A finger being brought to Nate&#39;s chin as he was forced to stare at the older man&#39;s face. The wrinkled brow, orange and grey beard, and toothy smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer interesting, boy. You&#39;ll be wasted in the cabins.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then let me go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain breaks out into a laugh. Sinister in sound as he glares at his newest recruit. Clearly contemplating something as he watches for a few more moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blimey. I haven&#39;t seen a brave lad like ye in a long time. But, I like keeping me crew.&quot;<br />
&quot;I never wanted to join.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet yer me cabin boy, savvy? Me magic gets to all men, and makes them mine. Yer just getting a few days time to fight it. But you&#39;ll submit, and be just like the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a loud cheer heard from the hall. Nate peaking through to see the other cabin boy spread out on the table. Spit roasted by two pirates, while stroking two other sailors who are gathered nearby. He tries to convince himself that he won&#39;t become like that, he&#39;ll be fine...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer wasting potential if ye become like Davis. I&#39;ve been looking for a man like ye, and I have a offer.&quot;<br />
Nate didn&#39;t trust any offers given by this man, but he still waited and listened.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hard to have kids when yer into men. But you&#39;d make a good son. Me own child, sailing by his father&#39;s side and spreading his old man&#39;s gift. Even helping him with a sailors primative need.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pirate wanted to make Nate into his own son? Nate didn&#39;t know if this was a better or worse fate than becoming a full cabin boy. He just wanted out, and he was going to get out. His determination clear to the captain who gripped the back of Nate&#39;s head and pulled him into a kiss. The older man firm and domineering, Nate forced into a state of complete submission as the pirate has his fill. The sailors free hand tightly holding onto his cabin boys rear, squeezing his bubble butt and making it known who belongs to who. Nate more than aroused as he instinctually submits to the captain, happy to have the stronger man put him in his place. Loving how the older pirates muscles tense as he grips onto the thinner crewmate. But it&#39;s over as quick as it began, the captain loosening his grip and pushing his subordinate away. Nate stumbling into the wall, breathes rapid as he tries to calm down. The captain only watching as he slowly returns to his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye can&#39;t resist. Prove yerself and I&#39;ll at least make ye a strong member of the crew. Do well, and you&#39;ll have a place in me family. Fail, and you&#39;ll be reduced to the ships hole. Try to escape, and you&#39;ll find yerself quite attached to me.&quot;<br />
He chuckles at his own hint.<br />
&quot;Now go, lad. Ships still dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate leaves the room at his captain commands. The thought of disobedience absent as he is unable to fight off the daze. Slowly coming to his senses while thinking on the captain&#39;s words. He&#39;s doomed no matter what he does, unless there&#39;s some way to end the curse.</p>
