<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha felt her fingernails slowly lengthen into recurved claws the instant she and William entered their home. It had been a good day and Martha was pleased to have reconnected with Nellie again, but it would be better to enjoy a very loving night with her husband. She watched him smile as his eyes shifted from their brown color in his human form to the red color they had in his fox form. His pupils stretched upward so that they became vertical slits in his red eyes as her own eyes went through a similar change, though her eyes were green in color.<br />
<br />
Her ears twitched as they migrated to the top of her head and became triangular and Martha felt herself smile as she watched William&#39;s ears go through the same transformation , though while her ears were warmed by brown fur, William&#39;s ears had black fur on the back and white fur on the inside of his ears. William calmly moved to pick up his briefcase and move toward the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we?&quot; William asked as he gestured up the stairs  as Martha watched her husband&#39;s fur grow over him, from the red orange coat that covered most of his body, the white fur along the sides of his growing muzzle and down his neck to the top of his shirt and the gloves of black fur at the ends of his hands. Martha also noticed that he had kicked off his shoes and socks and and them held with his briefcase, even as he rose up into a digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
Martha felt as her brown fur grew around her body. It reinforced the strength she felt at being a werecat. It was more than just the slight increase in her measurements or her muscles as she transformed and kicked off her own shoes and socks while feeling her own feet begin lengthen into very paw-like feet. In a way, it felt as though her werecat form was the REAL her and that her human form was just something she hid behind because she had to at times. In that, transforming always felt good, and in fact it even aroused her a little, and her feline nose could smell growing arousal on William&#39;s part as well.<br />
<br />
Martha twirled around to make sure that when she bent down to pick up her socks and shoes that he gave William a very good look at her butt. She picked up her shoes and socks and then slowly stood up in as sultry a manner that she could manage. She was rewarded by the scent of William&#39;s arousal growing stronger. She then turned as her face painlessly pushed forward into a rounded feline muzzle with brown fur, a brown triangular nose, and even brown whiskers. She smiled to William as he smiled to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;lets.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then began to walk up the stairs, swaying her hips as she went and purring as she felt her tail grow out behind her. She smiled as she swayed her tail behind her so that it moved in time with her hips. She made her way to the bedroom and tossed her shoes to the floor and made her way toward the bed and stripping off her clothes as she did so. She checked the bedside alarm clock, and it was at the clock that William had it for when he had to head for an eight AM class. His Tuesday and Thursday classes for this semester still allowed later starts, but with her sub days for the week, Martha had to be up on time for the public school days, and in theory, even if he didn&#39;t have classes early on Tuesdays and Thursdays, William could go in in for work at that time.<br />
<br />
As she finished setting the alarm, she felt William&#39;s paw-like hands run town her shoulders and then down her sides. His pads and fur rubbing softly against her own fur. It felt good, and as his hands reached her hips, Martha felt them slide down the front  until they began to rub at her vulva and one finger on each hand softly tweaking at her aroused clit. She gave a low moan and backed toward William. She purred in happiness as she felt her husband&#39;s erect member poke at her right butt cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;My... someone is happy to see me,&quot; Martha purred playfully as she looked back over shoulder while reaching down to take William&#39;s hands in her own him to continue to manually stimulate her vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to see you and happy to have your love,&quot; William smiled and leaned in to nibble softly on the right side of her neck and licking at her as well. William also drew one hand up Martha&#39;s stomach before cupping her right breast, making Martha moan. &quot;I&#39;m also happy to show you just how much I love you my brown furred sex-kitten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha turned around and moved to push William backward onto the bed. His huge member stood tall and proud between his legs, and Martha eyed it closely as she climbed up onto the bed to straddle William&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me,&quot; Martha purred and kissed her husband as passionately as she could.<br />
<br />
The kiss was as passionate as two beings with muzzles could manage. As they did so, Martha raised herself slightly and arched her back, as if to push her breasts closer to her husband and Martha purred in reward as William softly licked and nibbled at one nipple while caressing the other softly and flicking at that erect nipple with his thumb. It made Martha moan heavily as she felt William reach with his other hand to lift her upward slightly. Martha moved along with it to place her vagina over her husband&#39;s waiting erection, as with the pleasure she was getting from her husband&#39;s attention to her breasts was helping her get closer. She could feel it, and then William brushed against the erogenous zone at the base of her tail. That was enough to induce her to cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhh... yyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssss,&quot; Martha moaned as her body shuddered in pleasure and she smiled to her husband, &quot;I&#39;m ready... Show me how much you love me.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Martha leaned down and forward to kiss William again as she brought her body down onto her husband&#39;s erect penis. Once she had it stretching her vaginal walls, she began to thrust her hips forward to match William&#39;s thrusts into her and both them began to feel their mutual pleasure grow again. The only goal Martha had left was to get William&#39;s knot at the base of his penis to penetrate her, and as he continued to thrust into her and rub and nibble at her in all the right places, she knew she&#39;d have a good time achieving that goal.</p>
