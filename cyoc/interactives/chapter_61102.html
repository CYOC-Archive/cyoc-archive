<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It must have been that weird ring!&quot; you suddenly thought, remembering all that eerie singing that was coming <br />
from it when you pulled it from your pocket, the uber strangeness and the transformation only happening after <br />
you'd put it on. So, tearing your eyes away from the mirror, you looked back down towards your right hand, <br />
seeing that the once again plain gold band was sitting there comfortably on your ring finger, without even the <br />
slightest peep coming from within the metal. &quot;Okay ring,&quot; you said, pulling it off your finger with great <br />
difficulty, almost like it didn't want to come off, &quot;Let's find out what the hell you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping it into your hand, you found that once again, just as when you'd first found it, there appeared to be <br />
nothing extraordinary about the ring at all and you found it quite hard to believe that it was the same one <br />
that had shimmered with such intensity that you found yourself unable to resist putting it on. Rolling it <br />
around in your palms, you searched methodically for any sort of hidden switches or buttons or writing, <br />
something to help you out of this mess, but unfortunately you came up short.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAH! It's just a stupid piece of junk!&quot; you shouted angrily, throwing it with frustration, hard across the <br />
room. <br />
<br />
However just as you threw it, you heard a feint whisper in the air; &quot;Spirits heritage wake!&quot;* your brain not <br />
quite having time to translate as the ring suddenly froze in mid air and began to slowly revolve, the <br />
brightest white you'd ever seen beginning to glow from its surface. &quot;Whoa, that's kind of cool,&quot; you said to <br />
yourself, the spectacle not lost on you (even if you had just transformed into a woman) as you shielded your <br />
eyes from the light that was quickly becoming progressively brighter until the entire room was bathed in a <br />
warm, radiant white glow.<br />
<br />
The next thing you knew you were no longer standing in your dorm room but instead where surrounded by towering <br />
stone pillars, slabs of sculpted marble below your feet, ancient and worn, with cracks and rubble scattered <br />
all around. &quot;What the hell, where am I?&quot; you said out loud to no one in particular as you gazed around at what <br />
appeared to be some sort of ancient Greek temple, large sculpted statues of incredibly beautiful young women <br />
decorating every wall as well as a small, circular pool of water directly in front. The only light in the room <br />
was from the pool, making the room appear blue and eerie, the entire place appearing more like something from <br />
a movie or a dream than anything that could possibly exist in reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome sister*, you are in the Sanctuary of the Ring, our temple to Athena, we have waited long for you to <br />
come,&quot; a soft voice said from behind, causing you to snap quickly around, finding yourself staring at a <br />
gorgeous young woman draped in a long white robe, her dark brown hair cascading majestically down one <br />
shoulder. You Immediately recognized her as one of the women you'd seen in the wind cloud, her voice the one <br />
who had been calling to you from within the ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who...who are you?&quot; you stuttered nervously, jumping back a little surprised that she was actually real and <br />
standing there in front of you, careful not to fall backwards into the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Arianna, the former bearer of our legacy,” she replied, her voice still carrying that strange almost <br />
ethereal quality as she spoke, “before death took me and I could fight no more, before you.”<br />
<br />
As freaked out as you currently were and as weird as all this was, you couldn’t just let that last statement <br />
pass you by, saying rather startled, &quot;Wuh-wait, d-did you just say death?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,” the woman smiled rather calmly, “I have been dead for many years now, as have our sisters. It has been <br />
a long time since the ring of our Goddess was taken and we feared our legacy broken, that is, until you came <br />
along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just hang on a second, what are you talking about? What's going on here? Where am I?” you asked totally <br />
bewildered by what was going on, posing as many questions as you could, not entirely sure what this “legacy” <br />
or anything else she kept going on about actually was. Before she could answer any of them however, another, <br />
more important question suddenly sprung to mind, one that may just explain your current predicament, “Wait a <br />
minute, did you that turned me into a woman then?&quot; <br />
<br />
Adrianna stared at you rather blankly in response; her face looking almost as puzzled as yours was as she <br />
tried to answer you as best she could. &quot;I...I'm not sure I understand what you mean,” she told you, her voice <br />
then continuing as if reading a carefully prepared speech she’d spoken many times before, “You are the next in <br />
line, our champion, the one who by the wisdom of the great Goddess Athena have been chosen by the ring to <br />
carry on our legacy. You are the one who has been blessed with the strength, power, wisdom and beauty of all <br />
women to carry on the fight against evil and protect mother earth from those who might seek to destroy her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay...” came your reply, as you stared across at her, thinking her completely mad, the tale she’d just <br />
told you being like something you might have read in one of your comic books, which from the look on her face, <br />
she believed wholeheartedly. As strange a tale as it was though, who knows it might have been true, after all <br />
you were currently a woman, standing in an ancient Greek temple talking to a dead woman, but still there <br />
seemed to be one glaring error she just didn’t seem to be picking up on and that you had to set straight; <br />
“Just one problem though; I'm not a woman, I'm a guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a guy,&quot; you told her again, quickly pulling out your college ID from one of the pockets of your tattered <br />
jeans, holding it out in front of her as proof, &quot;See? Says it right there; Simon Blake, 18 years old, first <br />
year English student, not muscular Amazon champion woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the card, Arianna did somewhat of a double take, staring at you, then back down at the card, then <br />
back at you again, a look of utter disbelief appearing on her stunned face. &quot;No, no...this, this has to be <br />
some kind of mistake,” she said, shaking her head adamantly and pushing the card away from her face, “only a <br />
woman can be Athena's champion, you are obviously confused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am confused, you are right about that, but I'm definitely no woman, believe you me.&quot;<br />
<br />
