<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had had enough. Enough of this cursed Cabin, enough of this blasted curse, and enough guilt to last him a lifetime.<br />
<br />
Branches whipped past as James fled, some striking and licking his body as he passed them. Even the sting of their passing didn&#39;t ease James&#39;s memories. In his mind&#39;s eye, all he could see was the puffy pink asshole of his sister; his sister!<br />
<br />
What kind of a fucked up person does that to their sister?<br />
<br />
What kind of a fucked up sister does that to their brother?<br />
<br />
James fled for the only thing he thought would make him feel better, his girl Melissa.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d get out, find the car, get away, and find a way to send some help...<br />
<br />
That had been some half an hour ago, and he was still running. Heart now pumping, chest heaving with exertion, sweat pouring rivulets down his face all James could hear was the blood thudding in his changed ears.<br />
<br />
Twice James had somehow looped back to the Cabin, each time cursing as he reached the clearing&#39;s edge, before turning and fleeing back the way he came.<br />
<br />
This time, he had stopped after what he felt like was a good half mile from the Cabin. Panting James looked around, head in the air, blood still pumping in his ears as they flicked from side to side.<br />
<br />
Eyeing a solid tall oak he took a running leap, grasping the bottom branch and heaving himself up. Some grunting and straining later he found himself at the top of the tree. Rising above the canopy he felt the cool wind rush across his damp hair, sending shivers down his back. <br />
<br />
The wind wasn&#39;t the only shiver inducing sight. The view, on any other day, would have been breathtaking; lush green forest as far as the eye could see, hills rising and falling like waves of green into the distance. <br />
<br />
Spinning and turning he could make out one clearing in the trees, some half a mile back. In the direction he had come from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; He grumbled. That was the Cabin. He looked down, at the ground, a momentary vertigo which he shook off. There. A mossy boulder on the opposite side of the tree to where the clearing was. Perfect. He could climb down, use that as a marker, and head in that direction. James smiled. This was a good plan.<br />
<br />
Grinning he leaned back, holding tight on to a branch and began descending.<br />
<br />
*SNAP*<br />
<br />
The sudden shift in gravity sent James&#39;s stomach reeling. All muscles clamped up, his body going rigid in panic as gravity took hold. A rush of air and the whipping of branches greeted him. The only thought in his head &#39;FUCK&#39; before he struck ground.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next memory, though nowhere near coherent, that James had, was of sunbeams breaking through the green canopy and warming his face. It felt in a way good. But he didn&#39;t feel well at all. How had he gotten here. Why was he in a forest. He knew he felt anger and shame but couldn&#39;t exactly remember why. It was an elusive feeling. <br />
<br />
The snap of twig made his ears flick, twisting to the source of the sound. With a groan he turned to the source. A pained happy cry left his mouth as there, standing beside him, was Melissa. Brown hair flowing in the wind, gym gear painted to her shapely curves. James attempted a strangled greeting. Her pearly white wide grin cracked her face as she put a finger to plush lips. James watched and grinned as she lowered herself onto all fours beside him. On hands and knees she crawled over to the prone James, every step crunching the humus scattered on the forest floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel--ssa&quot; James croaked as she reached him, face hovering over him, blocking the sun. Every breath she took now huffed and puffed, blowing heavily on his face. Dazed still James knew he had to apologise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mel. I... Did a bad thing.&quot; He knew he needed to apologise to her, but he still couldn&#39;t remember why.<br />
<br />
She shook her head, understandingly, and leaned down, closing the distance between them. James closed his eyes, lips parting expectantly.<br />
<br />
Her lips brushed his. They didn&#39;t feel as soft as normal. Bigger even. But he didn&#39;t care. She had come for him, and she didn&#39;t care what he had done. He snickered as her lips flicked over his, as if trying to bite his face with her lips. Something tickled too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm---Mel...&quot; Her head pulled back sunlight beaming down on his face again. He tried picking his head up to look as Melissa&#39;s body hovered down to above his crotch. He could only keep his head up a brief moment before nausea took him and he had to lie back, and stare at the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad you came Mel. You won&#39;t believe what happened!&quot; He managed to slur. Remembering now that he had fallen from a tree. He received a grunt in response and jumped as he felt her head nudge his privates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mel. Now?&quot; He didn&#39;t feel great to be honest. He ached all over. But the feeling of seeing her had him on an adrenaline high right now.<br />
<br />
He felt her nudge again, and again, and again, each time more insistently than the last. He wasn&#39;t getting away with this. Lifting his arms for the first time since the fall he was happy to find that apart from cuts and bruises, they seemed to be whole. Carefully he undid his belt buckle, opening his fly and fishing out his penis.<br />
<br />
Immediately he felt Melissa&#39;s lips grasping for him. He could feel them tickling again as the kept grasping the flaccid penis and lifting it, attempting to put it in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing, use your hands!?&quot; James grunted, beginning to feel stirrings. But Melissa didn&#39;t listen to his advice. She responded with what sounded like &quot;Huh-Yeah?&quot; and went right back to trying to grab his member with her mouth.<br />
<br />
For a moment she managed to suck it in, holding it in her mouth as it hardened. Her usual finesse was out the window though as James thrust against her rough tongue sliding on the underside, before it pressed too hard and his dick fell out of her mouth. Impacting heavily against his thigh. Very heavily.<br />
<br />
Dazed James raised his head, fighting nausea to focus. It looked strange, his dick seemed bigger and browner. But that couldn&#39;t be... He grabbed it and held it upright. He only got to marvel it for a moment before Melissa&#39;s blurred head descended and wrapped itself around his shaft.<br />
<br />
Impressed that she was able to take it so deeply, James leaned back and sighed as the nausea ebbed. Now fully relaxing with the wonderful feeling of his girlfriend suckling his cock, even if it was a little rough, James felt open to talking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I did a bad thing Melissa. I think. I think I might have cheated on you.&quot; He winced, waiting for her to stop her ministrations. No such thing happened, however, Melissa kept sucking away enthusiastically. James sighed in relief, she wasn&#39;t going to kill him. Not now anyway. Something didn&#39;t sit right with James thought. He could remember he had cheated, but it hadn&#39;t just been some floozy or one-night stand. The back of his mind was telling him it was something significant. With someone close.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I know it&#39;s horrible. And I never meant it to happen. but... I can&#39;t remember Mel. I can&#39;t remember what ha... oh God don&#39;t stop!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He groaned. Edging closer and closer. Her mouth felt so tight around him. Like she was getting tighter and tighter, sucking harder and harder. With a grunt he felt her jolt, while still holding on to his cock with her mouth<br />
<br />
*SLAP*<br />
<br />
A loud slapping noise came from below him where Mel was suckling. He panicked for a moment, but quickly calmed as she kept suckling away happily. Another jolt. *SLAP*, and Melissa groaned into his cock. The moaning and jolting was driving him closer. Closer. <br />
<br />
There!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnnggghhh....&quot; He groaned, happily releasing his seed into his girlfriend&#39;s mouth. She happily kept suckling, jolting, slapping and moaning, even well after his orgasm subsided and her ministrations became uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel. W-what are you.&quot;<br />
<br />
*SLAP....SLAP* Another two jolts in quick succession. This time he could feel her moaning loudly &quot;Haaaawwww&quot; around his cock.<br />
<br />
This was off. He raised his head again. Nausea lessened but still a little googly eyed he tried to focus on her. In profile she was still on all fours, suckling him. Only her face was longer and body bigger. Her belly hung underneath her. As did something else.<br />
<br />
*SLAPPP!* She jolted again, an arm like appendage under her jiggled and slapped her belly with a resounding slap. <br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t right. Or was it? Did. Did Melissa have a cock?<br />
<br />
No. No she did not.<br />
<br />
His eyes opened wide, pupils finally focusing in horror on Melissa. Or not as he could now see. Bile rose to his throat at what he recognised as a grey-haired donkey happily sucking him off, all the while twitching so that it&#39;s massive cock kept slapping off his belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;yyyaaAAAAAHHHHHHH&quot; James yelled, finally finding his voice. He attempted to scramble back, but pain like no other lanced up from his ankle. The donkey, startled, let go of James&#39;s cock with a *pop* and turned at the shouting human. James for his part saw a large brown appendage with a flat head fall from the donkey&#39;s mouth. As it did everything else came flooding back to him. The curse. The woods. The forest. The Cabin. Jess...<br />
<br />
He had a horses cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAHHHHHHH!!!!!&quot; A shout of fear and anger ripped from him. The donkey, now no longer startled, raised it&#39;s voice in chorus and began frantically jerking it&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEE&quot; *SLAP* &quot;HAAAWWW&quot; *SLAP*<br />
&quot;HEEEEE&quot; *SLAP* &quot;HAAAWWW&quot; *SLAP*<br />
&quot;HEEEEE&quot; *SLAP* &quot;HAAAWWW&quot; *SLAP*<br />
&quot;HEEEEE&quot; *SLAP* &quot;HAAAWWW&quot; *SLAP*<br />
<br />
Rhythmically and in Horror James watched as the donkey began to cum. At first small clear ropes dribbled from it&#39;s large grey cock, then it began to get more cloudy, then it began to shoot it ropes, each more voluminous than the last, until finally the donkey came to a shuddering, dribbling stop.<br />
<br />
James&#39;s mouth hung open at the display. He had never seen anything like it. In a way he was impressed at the amount and virileness of this Donkey. His eyes boggled further as the donkey turned, revealing it&#39;s hindquarters to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a she???&quot; James bugged incredulously. Above a dangling impressive pair of balls, he could see a cleft. A large, well defined leathery black cleft. Fat lips ran either side and a doughnut of shiny puffy black flesh crowned the cleft. Something within him juddered. Always an ass man, the sight of such a perfect asshole excited him. It looked delicious. Like his sister&#39;s had. Even the cleft. <br />
<br />
A part of him wanted a closer look. As if sensing his request the donkey-girl began backing towards him. One step, two. Three. Now hovering within reaching distance. The wind shifted for a moment and James felt warmth on his face. The warmth of this donkey creature, and it&#39;s...<br />
<br />
James&#39;s hand began rising.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s perfect...<br />
<br />
&quot;JAAAAMMMEESSS!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
A call through the trees shocked James back to normalcy. What was he doing. It was Jess. Hand raised he slapped the rump of the donkey, seeing for a fleeting moment, that cleft wink open, revealing a ping interior before the donkey &quot;HAAWW&#39;ed&quot; and fled at the sudden strike. <br />
<br />
James fumbled, just about managing to cover himself up, before he heard scrambling feet behind him. He tried to rise and another shot lanced through him. He looked down, his foot was worse than he thought, even through his pants he could see how badly it was swollen.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEERREEE!&quot; he yelled. Getting another &quot;JAAAMMESS! I&#39;M COMING!&quot; in return. That was Jess. She had come looking for him. After everything. After all he had said. What he had shouted at her in front of their parents.<br />
<br />
Relief and shame flooded James as the sight of his sister, struggling to manage with her huge bust, came into view around a large boulder.<br />
<br />
Tears began streaming down James&#39;s face as he watched the looks of relief, worry and fear run though Jess as she made eye contact with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; He bubbled. Her face melted and she closed the distance, falling to her knees into where James knew the donkey had cum it&#39;s load.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh James. I was so worried. You&#39;d been gone hours!&quot; She caught him, cradling his head.<br />
<br />
Tears now flowing like a river it all came crashing down on James. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; He wailed as Jess tried to soothe her brother.</p>
