<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liam did not take very long to get back to his police car.<br />
<br />
Liam spat a few more times, registering it seemed like there was something he almost swallowed in there. Did Charlie try and dose him with something? He could almost see a tiny ball or something amidst the phlegm he spat up. Maybe he was just seeing things. Maybe he was just a little bit outraged that Charlie thought that was okay.<br />
<br />
He had utterly no idea what the hell Charlie was on that made him think to do...that. Liam was not a homophobe, that was for sure. He had no issue with gay guys, or bisexual guys, or really anyone who lived that way. What he had an issue with was someone deciding out of the blue to force a kiss on him. Liam had it in mind to teach a lesson to that preppy shit about consent and self control. He radioed in, &quot;Hey, Chief Denning, this is Officer Malcolme. I went up to the Hillside place...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I got Charlie to agree to turn the noise levels down a bit. He and his buddies up there are having a wall to wall fuckfest in there,&quot; Liam reported, deciding he should at least get that out of the way first, &quot;And...when I was surveying the place, the fucker planted a kiss on me. Just...outta the blue!&quot;<br />
<br />
A chuckle on the other end of the radio, making Liam raise an eyebrow. &quot;Well,&quot; the chief said, &quot;Maybe if you didn&#39;t leave your shirt open so much and display yourself like that, people wouldn&#39;t think you were available!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not funny, man,&quot; Liam said in a low tone. He didn&#39;t exactly expect much else from the folks around here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Liam, you can&#39;t say you wouldn&#39;t expect it...&quot; The chief laughed again, but upon hearing silence on the other end, he realized Liam really was taking this quite seriously. &quot;My God, you&#39;re really upset about this...alright. Alright. We can bring em up on charges of assaulting an officer if you want. But getting the charges to stick on one of the richest guys in town is not gonna be easy. We&#39;ll send some more folks over to serve them a notice and arrest the preppy fag.&quot;<br />
<br />
And of course, the chief still used language like that. It seemed this place - socially wise - was out of step significantly. Liam knew the chief was pretty old fashioned and traditional, but he guessed he had underestimated just how far it went. Liam did make a mental note to report the use of slurs and such to internal affairs when he could - they were certainly not in any contact with or influenced by the chief.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about sending a fucking message, Chief.&quot; Liam answered, &quot;I&#39;m not gonna put up with being played with that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, Officer Malcolme.&quot; Another deep laugh and the radio went quiet. Liam sighed, and decided to start getting ready for whatever the act of serving Charlie that would look like. Whatever the case, Liam was not looking forward to going back there. He washed his mouth out again with some water from a bottle he kept by his seat and commenced driving off. He just knew that the other officers would probably be laughing their asses off at him for getting that done to him.<br />
<br />
Liam certainly did, however, look forward to fucking his frustrations out tonight with his girl. <br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Liam the next morning got up from a lively and reassuring night with his girlfriend Cindy. As frustrating as her family was, she was a refreshing breath of fresh air by comparison. Lively and vivacious, she had basically rode him all night long until he fell asleep mid-thrust even. Liam tensed his ass and flexed as he enjoyed the feeling of waking up after falling asleep during a nice, long fuck session. &quot;Sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree?&quot; Liam sang to himself as he swaggered to the bathroom of his apartment.<br />
<br />
He cleaned himself up, grinning at his reflection and checking himself out. As usual, he looked hot and strong, always something to admire in the morning.<br />
<br />
When Liam checked his phone to see if there were any notices about the whole ordeal yesterday, he noted there were a few. Checking his voice mail, Liam noted with a sigh and a frown that it seemed Charlie&#39;s folks paid for his bail already and got him out. They&#39;d lawyered him up, and in all likelihood he would face jackshit in terms of legal consequences for sexually assaulting Liam. &quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s to be expected. Around here, you can&#39;t face time if you&#39;ve got the right parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, the more Liam thought about it, the more he remembered about that weird thing he coughed up. Could Charlie be on some kind of drugs? He cupped his chin. It more than merited an investigation. If he couldn&#39;t get Charlie on those assault charges, maybe he could embarrass him enough with his folks with some kind of drug charge. Around here, they attached a bit of stigma to drug use. Undeserved, maybe. But more than sufficient to get Charlie in some trouble he probably couldn&#39;t weasel his way out of.<br />
<br />
It just meant that Liam was going to need to look into what the hell kind of drug Charlie was on.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know of many that were contained in those kinds of tiny spheres, let alone ones that... well, WAS it drugs that changed how Charlie looked? He looked like he lost significant muscle mass and height, and his eyes looked different. Let alone his behavior. Much as it would absolutely rankle Liam, he needed to start seeing if he could tail Charlie a bit and see what was going on with him. There was certainly aught that wasn&#39;t right in the state of Maine right now.<br />
<br />
Liam got dressed in a yellow and blue tank top shirt and black shorts, knowing from experience that Charlie and he used the same gym. Maybe he could catch him in there and see if there was anything more that was different now. He was going to get that creep one way or another - and find out what Charlie was on to get him acting that way. As Liam pulled on track and field shoes and socks, he considered his approach...<br />
<br />
As Liam drove out in his car to the gym, he made sure he had his gym equipment including gloves and water bottle - he didn&#39;t want to make this look like he was investigating anything. No, he was just here to use the gym, enjoy himself as he always did, and maybe - okay definitely - get some women checking him out. As he looked around, he saw Charlie&#39;s car parked out front - meaning he was going to be able to get this guy in here today. See what was going on today.<br />
<br />
Liam entered, waving flirtatiously to the athletic young woman who managed the front desk. As usual, she blushed and checked him out. Ahh yeah there we go, Liam thought, exactly where I like to be.<br />
<br />
Following a good 90 second warm up, Liam entered the free weight room to get a look around for Charlie. And he saw the rich guy, today it seemed Charlie was...</p>
