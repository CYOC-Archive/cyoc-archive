<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Was she Nikki? Or was she someone, something, else. This and other questions ate at her as she travelled with the other one of her kind, yet not the same as her. Sometimes biology took its need, and when she felt ready to give in, she became receptive of the other&#39;s attention. Otherwise, she was content to lick her swollen privates, rub them against areas which provided relief, oblivious to the way each time she did so, the last bits of who she&#39;d been vanished.<br />
<br />
Her head morphing last, if there had been anything of Jeff left, they would have been surprised at how there was no feeling to the change. There had been discomfort in some area, such as with the shift from two legs to four legs had occurred, or the way there was a persistent itch when their canine ears formed. But now, as the skull completely reformed from human to canine, the brain transformed from that of a human to a very intelligent, self-aware, beagle, and fur grew over, Nikki was oblivious to the alteration. Finding her attention drawn to other things, such as first finding a way out of the truck she and other had fallen asleep, they&#39;d ended up being chased out by the owner, a suitable place to sleep, food, and, when necessary, satisfying her body&#39;s needs, the last bit of the transformation was completely missed by her.<br />
<br />
What seemed to her as months slipping by, she had no way to describe the passage of time and how long she&#39;d been away from what her mind insisted was the warm place with the ones who cared for her. Her awareness stripped down to the most basic, she understood the discomfort of the cold, especially when she had to squat to do her business, and how if it became too cold, she was forced to huddle somewhere with the other, sometimes under the cold stuff covering the ground, if they could manage to dig down into it. Her thick fur helped provide protection and warmth when required, and had there been any of the human mind left, she would have been thankful for the winter coat. And when the time shifted, and the cold grudgingly gave way to first rainy days, then to warmer ones, she slowly shed the thicker coat as winter gave way to spring, then summer. Travelling far and wide with the other, she had no thought as to where she was going, but on a deep core, felt herself driven toward a specific location, and was content for the moment to roam wherever she and other allowed their instincts and other basic functions lead them.<br />
<br />
The world full of smells, things to chase, areas to investigate, she was content to live out the rest of her life as a pure-breed beagle bitch. Waking one more to find the other had left at some point, she found on some level she did miss him, as they were a small pack, but soon her attention was drawn to other things and the other was soon forgotten. Shaking and stretching, she sniffed at the thing she and other had slept on, the word mattress no longer meaning anything to her, then at the large thing next to it, what Jeff would have recognised as a dumpster. Smelling something good, but not seeing any way to get at it, Nikki whimpered and looked up. Seeing it was too high for her to leap, she whimpered as she paced back and forth a moment, looked for the other, and yelped in startlement when there was a sudden banging noise and an irate voice screamed, &quot;Damn dogs. You get out of here. You get out of here now. You no go through my trash,&quot; followed by more banging noises.<br />
<br />
Driven off, tail tucked between her legs, Nikki fled from the sounds. Not understanding the words fully, but able to grasp some on a simple level, she didn&#39;t stop until she was someways away. Sniffing at the ground, the surrounding area, she soon found something dropped and happily eating it, she set off when she finished. Avoiding as much as she could the places where the loud, smelly, fast things were, what Jeff would have called cars, her route took her down alleyways, over sidewalks, and when the coast was clear, across roads. Stopping to sniff at a hedge, smelling the passing marks of others of the same species, she squatted to add her own before she moved on. Failing to understand how the sprawl of the city had given way to hush of the suburbs, had she been cognisant of such facts, Nikki would have also been shocked to learn how, in a round-about manner, she had almost come full circle and was near the place her mind insisted was the warm place. Finding herself in a large, open woodland area, the park where Jeff first started the change from teenage boy to beagle bitch, she stopped to roll in something in the grass, gave as loud a woof as she could, and hearing an answering bark, she replied, leapt up and ran in the direction in had come from.<br />
<br />
When she reached the area cordoned off for those of her species, Nikki slowed. Something deep in her mind coming to her, she experienced a moment of confliction as she thought this was where she was supposed to be and this was where she had gotten lost. But then it slipped from away from her when she smelled the others of her kind, even one who was the same as her, and giving another bark, she bounded into the area to find them. Greeting others with sniffs and sounds and licks, Nikki was soon confronted with another beagle. Mind grasping this was the other one l she&#39;d picked up on, she sent subtle signals to them as she became aware of two things.<br />
<br />
The first to come to her was this one was like her, yet not like her. Whereas she needed to squat to pee, they could lift their leg. Thrusting her muzzle under the leg he raised, she licked him until his red shaft poked out, at which point she began to administer her tongue to it. This in turn led to another bit of discovery, for having no concept of time and at its passage, had the part of her which had once been Jeff been more present, it would have been a shock to understand it hadn&#39;t been three seasons, but actually closer to seventeen months. And as the two-year-old beagle sniffed, licked, and communicated on several levels, her own biological needs came into play as she found she wanted him to mount her. A need which was worse than what she&#39;d felt with the one she had journeyed with, and would have alarmed had it been known the deeper context of how this need to procreate had a in a turn been helped along by a computer software programme.<br />
<br />
Attention, and affection, for each other growing, the two pure-blood beagles played and rough-housed with each other. Sometimes they would let the others in the park join in, but for the most part it was simply each other they had eyes for. And when things stepped up to the next level, Nikki, unlike Jeff had had, had no issue with sending both verbal and subtle clues of what she wanted until, lifting her tail, she presented herself.<br />
<br />
His understanding of what the female wanted at its most basic, the male beagle didn&#39;t give a second thought as he mounted her. Thrusting and working at her, gripping her tight by wrapping his front legs around her, it didn&#39;t take him long before he&#39;d found her slick vagina, gave it a few quick jabs, and when she didn&#39;t pull away, he set to work until they were knotted together. Biological needs taking over completely, both Nikki and the male gave themselves over to what countless others of their kind had done for years on end. Having and seeing no issue with what they were doing, it was some time before they separated, at which point each began to lick and sniff the other. Finishing with this, they each sounded a cry, tore out of the area cordoned off for their kind and across the park.<br />
<br />
Their path taking them out and into the surrounding neighbourhood, it wasn&#39;t long before they found themselves squeezing their way under a fence. Racing across the yard they were in, they started to play until biology again took its course and Nikki indicated what she desired. Afterward, they made their way toward a doghouse set off to one side, and slipping inside, they curled up together and were soon fast asleep. And again, had any part of Jeff remained, it would have come as a surprise the yard they had ended up, the house she would soon enter to eat in, and have a collar put on her once it was figured out who she was, as well as where she slept, it was all were she&#39;d started his transformation, for she&#39;d come home, no longer the eight month bitch who’d left, troubled by a transformation they struggled against, but now fully a beagle bitch who was a month or so over two-years, knowing on some level who and what she was.</p>
