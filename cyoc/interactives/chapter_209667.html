<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What Kat hadn´t known, because it wasn´t written in her book, is that if there is no clear object named, the targeted person would unknowingly set it itself, when he or she touched a fitting object, or is only a few centimeters away from it. Additionally, the person would be drawn to a fitting object if it was near enough, and the real connection would take between a few hours up to a day to build. That would ensure that the target didn´t know what object it was connected to, beside that the person would forget it ever touched the object in the fitting time.<br />
A fitting object, as it is, would also be something the target would connect directly or indirectly with a sex-toy. In the end, it could even be something completely different, only chosen by a connection of thoughts. If the target connects a word or activity with sex, and an object is also connected to said thing, it can become a fitting object.<br />
Another mistake made by Kat, which wouldn´t bother her, quite the opposite really, was that she had far overpowered her spell on Dan, not knowing her magical strength yet. That would result in him not connecting to only one object, but several different ones.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what cruel fate was before him, Dan fled his house. But the spell already had taken two targets in his house. One was in the bag near the door of Kat´s room, a bag from her boyfriend, which Dan nearly fell over before leaving. While the other had been downstairs as a present for Kat herself, which Dan touched unaware of even doing so.<br />
Ten minutes later, Dan reached his friend Harry´s house, ringed the bell, and was quickly let in by him.<br />
“Hi Dan. I thought you would be home for your sister´s birthday?” Harry greeted him once he stepped inside.<br />
Dan grimaced. “Hi Harry. No, we had a little fight and I left, not in the mood for her birthday afterwards.” Now Dan was a bit confused. Why had he said it like that? He didn´t know that he couldn´t talk about Kat´s magic yet, and the spell would create an excuse he could say.<br />
“Too bad for her, then. Well, we have my aunt Lisa over for today. She brought her twin babies, who are about three-months old. There have been visiting various family members and friends in the last three weeks, but will drive home tomorrow.” Harry explained while climbing the stairs up to his room.<br />
Dan, who was following him, stopped short. “I´m sorry, Harry. If you want to spend time with your family, I can visit someone else.” He was about to turn around, not wanting to disturb his friend´s family meeting.<br />
Harry, knowing Dan, had stopped as well, turning and grabbing his arm before Dan could go back down. “Don´t worry, Dan, you aren´t disrupting anything. I had already hide in my room, as aunt Lisa is overprotective with everyone. Having someone over will be a reason to not stay with them all the time. I just said it so you don´t wonder if one of the twins started crying loudly.” Harry reassured Dan that he wasn´t interrupting, and they continued up to Harry´s room, where Harry sat on his office chair, while Dan sat on Harry´s bed. Not knowing that, right beneath him under the mattress, was another object his body quickly connected to. It was the third one now, and Kat´s spell wasn´t finished, yet.<br />
<br />
Over the next hour, Dan and Harry played a game on the computer, talking about school and girls, and simply relaxed a bit from the day.<br />
But after that hour, aunt Lisa came looking for Harry, and nearly dragged them both into the living room to the family, after greeting Dan. Once there, they couldn´t really escape the family again, and Dan was included in all the talking, sitting near the sleeping twins.<br />
When they started to wake up, Lisa was already in the kitchen, making their milk ready, and Dan tried to calm the soon crying babies together with Harry. But they only really stopped when Lisa returned with the bottles. She pushed them into Dan´s hands to hold, taking little Jasmin up to fed her the bottle, while Harry was to do the same with little Jeremy. Now Dan was holding onto both pacifiers he had collected after the babies had spit them out, waiting with them cleaned for the twins to get them back.<br />
Just as he stood there, Dan felt a light shock going through him, but had no idea if he had simply imagined that. Unbeknownst to him, that had been the sign that Kat´s spell had chosen enough objects and it was starting to set. Now it would take its time to finish the connection, before Dan would feel them.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, both Dan and Harry crashed in Harry´s room, and where asleep in seconds. They had entertained the twins for some time to make them sleepy again, but it took enough out of them to join the twins in dreamland shortly later.<br />
At the same time, Kat´s birthday was rather calm, as they would have her party on the weekend. So, only she, her parents and her boyfriend, Max, had a nice dinner.<br />
Her parents had been a bit angry for Dan missing this, but Kat had explained the same excuse Dan had used at Harry´s, that they had a little fight and Dan wouldn´t want to disturb her dinner.<br />
A bit later, Max went home, taking his bag home with him. “Sorry for forgetting this here, Kat. It would be quite embarrassing if your parents, or God beware, your brother had looked inside.”<br />
“No problem. That´s why I took it into my room, it´s less likely they would look inside here.” Kat explained and waved the apology away. She had to keep her laughter in as Max showed her his fleshlight, with was inside, but she let it out once she was alone in her room. How likely would it be for her brother to be connected to her boyfriend´s fleshlight? Only question was then, if he was connected to it, was it to his mouth or his ass?</p>
