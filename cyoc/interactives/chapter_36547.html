<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jon's your average class clown. At the age of seventeen, he still liked to draw a crowd and cause a ruckus  in class. Teachers said it was because he was intelligent and didn't know how to channel that brilliance properly. The school counsel also said that he was intelligent, but was a lazy and that his problems stemmed from problems at home.<br />
<br />
In truth, Jon was just bored. He knew that he had an intelligence that even the nerds in school would love to have. His problem was also that he lacked a mentor to point him the right direction. So in class, knowing the stuff already, he acted out.<br />
<br />
It was lunch time and he was planning to have some fun. Earlier he had caught a raccoon and rigging an elaborate piece of equipment, planned to release it during either lunch or the pep rally later.<br />
<br />
Jon had just about made up his mind, when he noticed a folded piece of paper tucked under the carton of milk he had bought for lunch. Wondering what it was, thinking that someone knew what he was up and was warning him, he opened the note.<br />
<br />
It was a blank piece of paper. Or so he thought. Just as he was about to crumple it up, words began to form on the paper. He read: <br />
<br />
Dear friend.<br />
<br />
You look like the intelligent type. That and you also resemble a person who likes to cause all sorts of chaos. If this is you, read on and watch the amount of chaos you can create just by simply filling out a questionnaire. Warning: This questionnaire cannot instill a slave and master personality on you or another person. The moment the first question appears, you must fill out the questionnaire or something bad will happen.<br />
<br />
Wondering about this, Jon knew for a fact that he wasn't the type to want to be a slave or master to anyone and he certainly didn't wish that on anyone else. Figuring he could use a good laugh, he pulled a pencil from his backpack.<br />
<br />
The moment he did this all the previous writing disappeared. Thinking it might be a type of visible/invisible ink, he watched as the next words appeared on the paper.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl....<br />
<br />
Before the rest of the question could form, Jon laughed out loud and feeling rather sarcastic wrote down:<br />
<br />
What are you talking about? I am a girl! I'm a twelve year old Neko girl. I have Siamese Cat seal point ears and a matching tail. I have A cup size breast that will one day grow to be a perky B cup My height is  four foot nine and will reach a max height of five foot three. I wear a size one woman's shoe and will wear a size four when down growing. I currently wear size small, but will wear size S/M when finished growing. Right now I'm wearing a tight pair of blue boxers with different coloured hearts on them and pictures of Hello Kitty. My tail is poking out a hole cut in the back. All my clothes are specially tailored for my unique figure; which is lithe and cat like and will always be so. I'm also wearing a white t-shirt that has a pink glitter heart. Hanging on the top of that is Hello Kitty. Over her is a the word Princess, which is also glittery. I have six nipples because I just got my first heat cycle, which is odd for me because four nipples have appeared just below my breasts and will disappear in a couple of days. Also, I have no bra on under my shirt. And before you ask, I have no hair on my body. The only hair I have is my thin eyebrows and the hair on top of my head and thats the only hair I'll ever grow; no need for shaving for me, thank-you. Plus, I'm an only child; A very intelligent only child. Currently it is six o'clock on a beautiful July morning.<br />
<br />
Laying the pencil down, chuckling, waiting to see if this note would do anything, Jon suddenly felt dizzy. Leaning forward, he closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
The world shifted and Jon felt something soft below him. Opening his eyes, he found that he was looking up at a white ceiling. Beneath him, he realized was a bed. Sitting up, he looked around.<br />
<br />
He was in a girl's bedroom, that was obvious. Throwing back the sheets, Hello Kitty, he stepped out of bed, ignoring his physical appearances. He was just about to open the bedroom door, when he almost screamed in terror when he saw the other person in the room.<br />
<br />
On closer inspection, it turned out to be a mirror. Going to the door, he made sure it was secured tightly and locked. Turning back to the mirror, he peered into it's reflective depths.<br />
<br />
A very pretty girl with long brown hair and strong green eyes looked back. Seal point cat ears poked out of her long brown hair and a black, furry tail switched back and forth behind her. &quot;If I didn't know any better, I'd think I was just turned into the girl I had described on the note.&quot; Jon thought.<br />
<br />
Looking down, Jon gasped when she saw the clothes on her body. They matched the description given to the note perfectly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly worried, Jon pulled down and removed her boxer shorts. Next to come off was the shirt. Dropping both on the bed, Jon turned back to the mirror. The body was also a perfect match to the description. Running a soft, petite hand across her flat stomach and abdomen, she felt the four extra nipples. Feeling them get hard, Jon's hand strayed even further down and she began to massage her clitoris. As it became hard and started to slide up under the clitoris hood, she purred to herself, &quot;I feel so amorous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snapping back before it could go any further, still feeling horny, Jon was worried. He was the twelve year old Neko he had described, but beyond what she was wearing and her physical appearances, he knew next to absolutely nothing about the girl he become.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is my name? Who are my parents? Do I have any friends? Do I know any other Nekos? Do I attend a public school or a private school? Hell, besides Hello Kitty, what do I like and find interesting?&quot; These and more were the question Jon began to ask herself. But first a more pressing need had made itself known; a pressure on her bladder.<br />
<br />
Putting back on boxers and shirt, Jon unlocked the door and crept down the hallway. The first door she open was for a linen closet. The second, she was more lucky. Sitting down on the toilet, Jon released her bladder and thought. After a moment, she had an idea.<br />
<br />
Finishing her business, she pulled up her shorts, thought briefly how nice the soft fabric felt against her body, and exited back to her room.<br />
<br />
In her room, Jon began to search for something that would give her some clues about the life she had just occupied. Anything would be a good start. The first item she found was her......</p>
