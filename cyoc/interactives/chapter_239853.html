<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Ishinowa Island, one of the newer islands that Animalia had colonized that were part of the Ryukyu Islands and were fast becoming part of what was now being referred to as Heiya Prefecture, a pair emerald-green hands carefully moved about setting a simple white teapot over the burner on the stove to boil water for tea. And it was a healthy tea, something that the owner of those hands, Koji Tomoshita, felt some measure of pride in being able to have. Much of it comes from hir own past and things that related to hir own path to becoming an Animalian. As a herm Mamenchisaurus, many of those old issues were no longer there, and Koji was glad to be rid of them.<br />
<br />
Shi thought over some of the things that were there as part of hir own conversion. Some of it was a complicated process that involved some study and research, but Horizon also apparently wanted her to have some conversation with others that would be able to provide for both accepting the new form and size, not to mention also dealing with many of the other issues that had helped fuel things that had led to hir need to convert. It had made some fairly interesting zoom calls while preparing for hir conversion.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The wide eyes that Koji could see on the screen were clear. On the right side were the present pair of Mamenchisaurus Dinotopians, Remington and Vera Albers. On the left side of the screen was the largely grayish Brontosaurus Dinotopian, Devine. Koji could see the general scale for all three Sauropod Dinotopians. There were some bits of furniture that could be seen that Koji had some known scaling references to and paired that with what Koji had also read on the size of the various Sauropods. And both Brontosaurus and Mamenchisaurus could reach that 69 to 72 foot long range.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Vera asked on the screen, her voice sounding deeply concerned.<br />
<br />
Koji looked down at herself and could easily guess at the female Mamenchisaurus Dinotopia&#39;s concern. Much of her life had not been particularly healthy and had come from her own stresses that had led to her not eating well. She had a job where she didn&#39;t have to go into work, and thus did most of it over the phone, which Koji had accepted, but it also let her really let herself go with her thick and pudgy pink fingers looking almost as thick as the more muscular digits on any of the three Dinotopians. Koji wasn&#39;t entirely jealous either Vera or Devine&#39;s chests. Her breasts weren&#39;t as perky or as firm as the two Dinotopians, but given all the weight she had on her, her own chest wasn&#39;t exactly small. The thing that Koji was more jealous of was that all three of the Sauropod Dinotopians on the call had very trim stomachs. That was the biggest reason why Koji was deciding to convert. As her weight had brought with it a very impressive middle that hampered her mobility, which in the last few years became embarrassing to the point where moving was difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of heart health... yeah,&quot; Koji answered, grateful for a strong education, &quot;though... in terms of mobility... not as much. I can stand and take a step or two, but beyond that, I&#39;ll get winded. It&#39;s partially why I&#39;m converting and going with a Sauropod... and particularly Mamenchisaurus. Have something that would be comparably big to what I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how big are you?&quot; Devine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five-hundred ninety-eight point five pounds,&quot; Koji admitted weakly doing the conversion from the Metric System to Imperial in her head, &quot;mostly fat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might actually gain weight,&quot; Remington commented, &quot;though... it&#39;d probably be more muscle mass with the conversion, along with the neck and tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but that&#39;d also be what I&#39;m going for,&quot; Koji answered, &quot;I&#39;ve been good with my heart... but not being able to move isn&#39;t good, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare I ask what caused this...?&quot; Devine asked slowly and a bit nervously, &quot;I mean... I&#39;m no expert, but I would have thought that Japan was fairly well off in health and that sort of thing. I mean, sure, the Sumo Wrestlers are big, but they&#39;re also quite strong. Lots of muscle as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that is a lack of confidence... and why I&#39;m going for a herm conversion,&quot; Koji answered slowly and looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re transgender... you see yourself as male?&quot; Devine guessed, picking up the embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And my parents are VERY traditional,&quot; Koji answered, &quot;and I couldn&#39;t just confront them on it... as it&#39;d bring shame on me, and so... I&#39;d just eat and stay at home. Eventually they stopped caring to call or anything else and that was when I was able to legally change my name to Koji... which is a more male name. No one noticed... but my health and mobility brought about the need for change, and an Animalian conversion would help with that and would also allow for being more... whole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Conservatives,&quot; Remington grumbled in a low voice, &quot;always trying to turn back the clock and thinking that any change &quot;destroys the country.&quot; They&#39;d find that if they left things alone... the change that comes wouldn&#39;t do anywhere near the negative things they think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it isn&#39;t fair to you, Koji,&quot; Devine agreed, &quot;though... at the same time... you may have to come out and be forward with your parents. As once you convert, particularly into a Sauropod... it&#39;ll be pretty hard to hide that you&#39;ve changed. And I&#39;ll add that you won&#39;t be entirely male. As a herm Brontosaurus... I do have all the male equipment, but I also have all the female equipment. A perfect hermaphrodite. I may be a little smaller than Mrs. Albers here in the chest department, as a result of being a herm, but I can both sire eggs and lay eggs. Now... if only to find another herm Brontosaurus. Or at least someone who&#39;d become a Brontosaurus Dinotopian, male or female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I get that,&quot; Koji nodded slowly, &quot;and at my size... while my change is to be part of this weight loss party at Ao Guang Island... and they&#39;ll be lowering me into the sea to do it. Some of the guys I&#39;ve talked to at the Horizon offices here in Japan say they&#39;ve built a sort of specialized &quot;tub&quot; that I&#39;d be lowered into that can float at sea. The water would support my weight and my body while the mesh would make sure that as I change... I don&#39;t end up creating conditions that would spread the condition. And once I am a Dinotopian... I should be able to manage some things. And while Mamenchisaurus isn&#39;t Japanese... there are a couple of natural history museums in Japan that at least have copies of the animal&#39;s bones. It is certainly big enough.&quot; Koji then paused and looked to Remington and Vera, &quot;and I like the green color you two have... along with the gold dots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of our coloration may have more to do with the Green Tree Python DNA that had to be spliced in to assure that we&#39;d be able to bend our necks,&quot; Vera commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... all the long bones in the neck,&quot; Koji nodded, &quot;but... this is all to be a new start. Gain some self-confidence and all that... So, why not, stick my neck out.&quot; Koji paused for a moment and then looked down, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be ashamed,&quot; Vera urged, &quot;anyone can do anything if they put their mind to it... and in many ways, everyone is worth it. Regardless of sexual orientation or how they view their gender... everyone is worthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be differences,&quot; Remington commented, &quot;and I&#39;m sure Horizon and/or Doctor Ramos may ask for comparison tests between us and you for things strength and so on. But all that can be scheduled for the summer next year. Right now... we&#39;re just helping you get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thank you,&quot; Koji answered with a smile.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And the conversation with the Albers and Devine helped Koji work through some of hir self-esteem issues that had created a lack of confidence. When the &quot;weight watch party&quot; on Ao Guang Island arrived, Koji felt far more confident and able. At that time &quot;she&quot; had had to be carried out to where the tub was set up for the conversion into the herm Mamenchisaurus shi now was. The helicopter was strong and stable, but the physical transformation actually felt more empowering and as Koji looked to the pot where hir tea was brewing, shi thought back on all that...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
A part of Koji was a bit embarrassed at the heavy cargo harness that was presently wrapped around &quot;her,&quot; and it was all the more embarrassing that it was also a harness that would normally be used for the airlifting of livestock when that was something that had to be done. But given &quot;her&quot; size, Koji was also well aware that it also had to be done. She could see the large pieces of bright yellow foam that marked where the &quot;tub&quot; was floating. From what Koji had been told, its mesh was fine enough to let water through but sturdy enough to keep things like milk or sexual fluids out, and this was something that would have to be done, given the high levels of arousal that generally came with Animalian conversions. Remington, Vera, and Devine had also made specific mentions on how their transformations were ultimately quite arousing.<br />
<br />
And if it weren&#39;t for the heavy thumping sound of the helicopter&#39;s rotor blades, Koji might have heard the sound of some of the other related activities on the more &quot;private&quot; beach where the &quot;weight watchers&quot; conversions were happening. But Koji&#39;s case was rather special in that she was the only one becoming a Dinotopian, and specifically a herm Dinotopian. &quot;Her&quot; near 600-pound weight also required these more drastic measures and Koji could see that there were other measures also taken. Some of it was also noted in the shapes she could make out swimming outside the &quot;tub.&quot; In the distance, Koji could spot Kumiko and Ningen swimming at a relatively fast pace and periodically surfacing to breathe. The two White Orca Animalians were likely an outer line of defense, given that while the &quot;tub&quot; wasn&#39;t out in the open ocean, it was far enough out that most Human swimmers wouldn&#39;t ever come to, and that could mean that various ocean predators could take interest in the &quot;tub.&quot; Closer to it was a larger shape, and one that Koji noted swam in a more side-to-side motion than Kumiko and Ningen&#39;s up and down motion. Kumiyo, the Tylosaurus Dinotopian swam at a slower pace.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re far enough out that the &quot;tub&quot; could attract unwanted attention,&quot; Dr. Miyamoto spoke, noticing Koji&#39;s looking to the three aquatic Animalians swimming below them while Chel readied the syringes for Koji&#39;s conversion behind him, &quot;Kumiko and Ningen can better detect anything coming in and respond with speed to that threat and Kumiyo will be big enough to outmuscle anything that can speed around her cousin and her mate. If need be... Kumiyo could also pull the tub into shallower water as well. Though, we don&#39;t think there should be any difficulty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t Kumiyo have a mate as well?&quot; Koji found &quot;herself&quot; asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but Ty presently lives in Florida and they&#39;re still in a long-distance relationship, which isn&#39;t my business to pry into,&quot; Dr. Miyamoto answered, &quot;are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Koji looked down at herself and noted the large green gown that presently covered her. To a degree, it was a bit big and the harness that she was strapped into didn&#39;t help with the fit, but it was also about the only thing that would work. The plan was to lower her into the tub and then Chel would undo the harness&#39;s straps and return to the helicopter while Dr. Miyamoto delivered the injections. She looked back to see Chel hand Dr. Miyamoto the syringes, though with their orange safety caps still on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Koji admitted.<br />
<br />
With that, Koji managed to let herself drop out of the open door and then hang from the helicopter. The drop wasn&#39;t great, but Koji could feal herself dangle and sway on the heavy wire that attached her to the helicopter. &quot;She&quot; swayed back and forth for a few short passes but eventually settled into where she was hanging straight down. From there, the helicopter began to slowly descend toward the tub. Koji looked down and barely noticed Chel dropping from the helicopter and landing feet first into the water in the tub. Koji eventually noted seeing Chel rising back to the surface and floating in the water below the helicopter. Koji was about to say something when &quot;she&quot; made contact with the water. It wasn&#39;t cold, but Koji could still tell the difference between the air and the water&#39;s temperature.<br />
<br />
Koji sank a little, and this felt rather obvious. People were buoyant, and to a degree, fat could add to that, but the weight that Koji had was enough that once she was in the water, she did drop a bit into the tub. Thankfully, she did return to the surface and finding that the tub was also deep enough so the Dinotopian form she would grow to would be contained by it, though she didn&#39;t know on whether or not the clothing she was wearing would survive it. &quot;She&quot; wouldn&#39;t miss her clothes and hoped that the herm element of her conversion would make her a little less female than what Vera Albers had. As Koji surfaced &quot;she&quot; looked over to Chel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this made for Kumiyo since she&#39;s a species of Mosasaur?&quot; Koji asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Chel answered, &quot;Kumiyo was converted on Heiya Island. This was set up when your doctors contacted Horizon about you wanting to convert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to put so much pressure on you,&quot; Koji found &quot;herself&quot; saying.<br />
<br />
Chel carefully undid the metal clasps that held the harness to her. The Axolotl Animalian gave a small smile before saying, &quot;it&#39;s no problem. Depending on how your conversion goes and what can be assessed from the &quot;tub&#39;s&quot; durability, we might be able to provide for other uses for it, not just as a conversion tub.&quot;<br />
<br />
Koji couldn&#39;t help but smile as the harness was lifted back up into the helicopter, lifting Chel with it as she hung onto the wire. The helicopter then came further down to where it was almost sitting on the water. Koji could feel the wind from the rotors coming down on her and managed to lift up an arm, so that Dr. Miyamoto could deliver the injections. The Human doctor had to lay on the floor of the helicopter to reach down and deliver the shots, but he managed and gave Koji a small smile as Chel climbed back into the helicopter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Dinotopia,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto spoke politely and delivered both shots.<br />
<br />
From there, the helicopter then lifted off into the air, though it had to put a lot more power into its rotors. This in turn actually pushed Koji under the surface of the tub after the second shot was given. There was no pain, and nothing was felt at first, but after &quot;she&quot; was fully under water, Koji did begin to feel warmer. The warmth was soon followed by surges of energy and those surges seemed to go in all directions. It created an odd and painless sensation, even as her neck began to push forward, and as new vertebrae formed with appropriate cushion between them. The same was true as she felt a tail begin to grow out behind her. Once Koji was able to move it, she actually wagged it a bit as she enjoyed the feeling of water moving over the appendage, even if Sauropods weren&#39;t lake dwelling animals.<br />
<br />
Another spot where Koji could feel water moving was on &quot;her&quot; head. As her Human hair fell out and her neck continued to grow longer, she could feel the water moving over the skin on her scalp. Koji tried to feel her head, but in raising her arms up, she found out two things. One was that she really couldn&#39;t reach her head anymore and the other was that &quot;her&quot; skin didn&#39;t feel the same anymore. Presently being underwater, she really couldn&#39;t see the change as her eyes weren&#39;t designed to look through water, but &quot;she&quot; also figured that as her changes continued to progress, her skin had come to match the scaled patterns that the Albers had, complete with largely green body with a very light-green or greenish white belly and with periodic gold spots on the dorsal side. It was a carry-over from the Green Tree Python DNA used to alleviate the issues presented by the long bones in the neck of Mamenchisaurus that would limit the mobility of that neck without alteration.<br />
<br />
But none of this was painful, and as she began to surge toward the surface and with the tip of her tail brushing against the bottom of the tub, things began to feel different. The old sort of swimming dress that Koji had put on that felt a bit big over her massively overweight frame as a Human was actually now beginning to feel tight on her. Her breasts didn&#39;t feel any bigger, though they did feel a lot perkier, and Koji could now feel there wasn&#39;t a large belly of fat underneath them. It was like all of that had been burned away into energy or other portions of her new anatomy and moved to fit it. It enlarged muscles and widened her shoulders which was straining the swimming dress that she&#39;d been given. She could also feel something growing inside her. It wasn&#39;t something that hurt and was centered at her waist. In fact, it felt good and began creating a pushing sensation in her clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoooooaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; Koji found &quot;herself&quot; cheering as she burst up into the air and actually began to bob in the water. The helicopter was still above her, but it was now at a safe distance where the pilot wouldn&#39;t have to be making sure there was no shift in its pitch or anything else. &quot;Wow... my voice is deeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t just her voice that was deeper as &quot;she&quot; began to get a sense of what that pushing sensation was. Taking her now well-muscled fingers, with one sporting the spiked hoof that was present on Sauropods, Koji pulled at the seams of her dress and pulled. The dress came apart at the seams and soon just floated away and fully freed everything underneath. And while the sea water wasn&#39;t clear enough to see through, Koji was also well aware of what that pushing sensation was. She was no longer a she, but a shi as hir clit had lengthened and altered in a way that would let it serve as a fully functional penis. And as shi rotated in the tub, shi could feel the water move around that enlarging shaft as it grew longer and meatier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yessss...&quot; Koji smiled as things felt so good.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And with hir conversion, Koji had found many things were different, and they weren&#39;t just in relation to hir form. Shi found herself more confident and willing. Feeling more complete than shi&#39;d ever felt, Koji did manage to make the call to hir folks, but to inform them of hir conversion into a Dinotopian but that it was a herm conversion as well. Some things were awkward and came off a little weak, even with hir now deeper and more masculine voice than where it had been, though it wasn&#39;t as deep or as low as Remington&#39;s voice, but it was not without its own surprises. Hir parents didn&#39;t pretend to understand everything, and they wished some things had been different, but much to Koji&#39;s surprise, they also still said they loved hir and were glad that she&#39;d gotten over the things that had led to hir gaining so much weight as a Human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... as a herbivorous Dinotopian, a lot of the foods that are healthy that I didn&#39;t like before... they actually taste a lot better now,&quot; Koji thought to hirself as the water for hir tea began to boil, &quot;I wonder if that&#39;s the same for every herbivorous Animalian that was once Human...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi also looked forward to the coming summer, when Remington and Vera Albers would be able to come to Ishinowa Island and all the comparisons between hir as a herm Mamenchisaurus and them as male and female Mamenchisaurus Dinotopians could be fully made and documented.</p>
