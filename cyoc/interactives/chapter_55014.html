<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: Had distant family over all this week. <br />
AN: And I had a loss in the family today. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Martha, Whitney, Ryan, and Abdul with their seven sets of arms carried the two sets of <br />
quadruplet to the living room, which was uncharacteristically empty due to their medical <br />
trouble.<br />
<br />
Martha knew that they weren't their pups, but they were children in the house hold she as <br />
an Omega had swore to serve and protect without question, and they had both just <br />
someone who could never ever be replaced.<br />
<br />
All possibilities, all paths, all things in life left to be explored, all of it, just gone, GONE! <br />
Forever and ever. There was no magical resurrection, no cheating of death. They were <br />
dead.  They were gone now and wouldn't be coming back! <br />
<br />
No one spoke for there were no words to describe this loss. Every part of a family was a <br />
supporting beam of the whole, and now two of them had been stripped away, worse that <br />
these eight had lost the two whose duty it was to teach them how to be women, how to be <br />
adults, it wasn't right. <br />
<br />
Martha had the mad thought of taking the eight cubs to an amusement park as a <br />
distraction. However, she couldn't do that without permission from their fathers, and <br />
Martha knew she couldn't have the girls be with only one or two carecakers, and at the <br />
same time, with so many of the pack now either injured or in service to those who were:  <br />
Martha and her fellow Omegas couldn't simply LEAVE the estate. <br />
<br />
Martha thought pragmatically, 'Too bad most rides aren't built to accommodate adult <br />
lupmen and leoman and gargoyles ... felmans and humans don't have that problem.' It was <br />
simply a matter of population verses the cost of making services practical to that part of <br />
the population.  Nobody liked it in the least, but it was a nasty truth of economics. <br />
<br />
The Omegas deposited the cubs onto the couches like they were cloth dolls, most not <br />
responding. Abdul turned on the television, the truth worthy pacifier of the century, but <br />
the cubs barely responded to the colorful creatures bouncing around happily. <br />
<br />
Mary came back, the reddish gold cub looking somewhat happy things considering. She <br />
looked at her four half sisters, &quot;Dad said that I could stay with you today...&quot; <br />
<br />
Moja didn't even look at her.  Mbili looked at her and somehow managed a smile.  Tatuli <br />
and Neli leaned against each other like a pair of paper weights. <br />
<br />
Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane huddled around each other like they were almost trying to crush <br />
each other together. Of course that didn't happen, could not happen, that wasn't how <br />
things worked. No matter how others liked it to be. And there were some cheats, too big <br />
for ANYONE or ANYTHING to allow. <br />
<br />
Sighing, Martha turned off the television and began to dance. Her moonlight dance due to <br />
cheating, and due to it not even being a full or new moon, wouldn't turn the cubs into <br />
pups, but it was still a beautiful dance and was silent and was it's own. Whitney, Abdul and <br />
Ryan soon joined in, the naked mutant wolves doing their best to give the G-Rated version <br />
of this dance. <br />
<br />
Saba's interest was perked from her sisters' huddle watching the dance, after all, the katas <br />
done by martial artists were also practiced and memorized movements of the body that <br />
were a form of art unto themselves. <br />
<br />
Mary meanwhile hugged Nane... it was so wrong to see the impish little cub look so... <br />
empty inside... <br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
1681 December 21st<br />
<br />
The sixteen year old Giselle (her birthday had been earlier that year), felt proud of herself <br />
of having turned the white leoman's cubs into his brother and sister instead: siblings were <br />
much better to have than parents and didn't die before you either.<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to be kidding me.&quot; Lawrence interrupted then and there.<br />
<br />
&quot;She and her siblings had never had much in the way of rivalry like the majority of sisters <br />
and brothers, and because they didn't have any long-term friends they didn't turn into <br />
objects or animals outside their familiars and Marie Cruz in their dreams, they had a rather <br />
skewed view of such things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not the half of it, and they were that powerful, AS TEENAGERS? Teenage girls with <br />
that kind f power? That's frightening!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as frightening as you realize how badly all three of them had 'Peter Pan syndrome', a <br />
refusal to grow up emotionally and socially. And while their power grew, their maturity only <br />
crawled along, they never 'became the mask' of good manners like the majority of people <br />
do as they enter adult years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But grown up scream, and shout and hit each other.&quot; Lilly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;... So do children... &quot; Marie said simply. &quot;And even as they entered adulthood themselves, <br />
they once considered themselves 'one of them.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one ever considers themselves 'one of them' they also consider themselves 'one of us', <br />
no one wants to be a 'them.'&quot; Betty said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that aside,&quot; Lawrence said, &quot;There were countless diseases during that period! <br />
Children died before their parents was NOT unheard of!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the witchling's little word.&quot; Glass Marie said, &quot;To them, the only problem wasn't <br />
with the natural world... they thought of death only related to old age, or adults killing <br />
other adults... they didn't think about how death happened in nature or the other ways <br />
that death happened that wasn't the result of one's own choices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW could they have that kind of double standard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People have double standards all the time, look at men and women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Better said, &quot;I know they're DIFFERENT standard, but I wouldn't call them DOUBLE <br />
standards and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd be very surprised.&quot; Glass Marie said very calmly. <br />
<br />
 +++++++<br />
<br />
1681 December 22st (three days before Christmas) <br />
<br />
<br />
The Omega groaned as she trudged along, with the screaming and yelling masses of cubs <br />
from the Alphas and Betas, they were so hyper active!   She hoped that European Holiday <br />
called Christ-Mass never made to this side of the ocean, the last thing she needed was the <br />
pack cubs even MORE hyper this time of year. <br />
<br />
Of course people stared, but no one gave them trouble unless the cubs started it which the <br />
Omega was doing her best to make sure didn't happen. The dark gray identical triplet boys <br />
of course were playing their game again of 'guess who did what.'   The Beta's children, all <br />
plain brown. Grays and browns were the colors the children of the Gammas and Delta who <br />
had come along purely for a chance to get AWAY from the estate which they considered <br />
their prison more than their home! <br />
<br />
They had read a lot of China and it's Emperor who was said he was forbidden to leave his <br />
own home! The pups of the third ranked sub-pack could seriously sympathize. 'Pups are <br />
the future. Pups are too precious to risk. Pups are too vulnerable to let into the outside <br />
world when they don't need to be!' <br />
<br />
This marked about the third time in their entire lives the Gamma-Delta pups had been <br />
outside the estate (the first time purely by accident of wandering too far away, and the <br />
second had lasted all of five minutes in their 'escape attempted' which had resulted in <br />
bright red bottoms all around and being prisoners of their own room for a month!). <br />
<br />
They had only been let out this time by begging, pleading, bargaining, and the good grace <br />
of the new Alphas. <br />
<br />
Griselle and Solome were also out shopping that way, buying the typical things needed, but <br />
also some odd items here and there from traveling sales men who didn't drop by that often <br />
least they attract the wrong attention. <br />
<br />
She saw the plain beige Omega suffering, and she LOVED IT. These were the ones who <br />
murdered Joella after all, they deserved everything they got! <br />
<br />
However, there were still children with them: the innocent, the pure, those not yet tainted <br />
by meaningless and dogmatic rules and laws that did nothing but constrain people and <br />
make everyone miserable! <br />
<br />
The brown pups were pulling on one arm to go one way, the beige ones were pulling her to <br />
go the other way. <br />
<br />
Finally the omega couldn't take it anymore and shouted, &quot;NOW SEE HERE! As long as you're <br />
outside the estate you're MY responsibility! Now listen to what -I- have to say!&quot; <br />
<br />
Griselle looked around, of course everyone was looking at the scene the pups were all <br />
making. <br />
<br />
Griselle and her sisters however had been tapping into the infinite chaos for the power they <br />
loved the most, the one which reality healed itself around their changes, meaning once <br />
they did truly destroy law, it would be like law had never existed! It would be so great! <br />
<br />
Griselle through Solome used her power, on the spot did what had to be the most complex <br />
spell to the altering of things since she had figured out how to turn people into fairies. <br />
<br />
The omega's fur turned silver, (cause it was a nicer color) and then their head split in two, <br />
then her arms, then her legs, then her tails, then her torso, in under a minute there were <br />
now two wolf women where they had been one. Both stood at attention and each looked at <br />
one side of the pups and said, &quot;We are here to serve only you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Instead of screaming or cowering before her however, the lupman present somehow <br />
realized it was her doing (maybe it was the two sets of glowing eyes), they all took one <br />
look at her and said, &quot;Whao! Cool!&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;That is just plain hypocrisy!&quot; Maddex couldn't take it anymore. Lilly and Casandra actually <br />
hugged each other surprised at the out burst from their father. <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. But of course Griselle didn't see it as such, as far as she was concerned, children <br />
were naturally more pure, more clear thinking, more rational, and kinder than adults, so <br />
making an adult a slave to children was easily justified and for the greater good.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Those two word seems to get around a lot.&quot; Lawrence commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;And they can be used correct, and incorrectly...  When Griselle told the others what she <br />
had done, they figured it was a nice way to get back at the Lupmans for Joella's death. And <br />
that was when thunder struck the three of them.   Just as they gave bright colors as the <br />
ability to escape to male Lupman cubs who were sick of being imprisoned inside their own <br />
home, they realized they could give the same gifts to female leoman cubs who were tired <br />
of being treated similarly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think since male births are more rare with Leomans that the boys would be treated as <br />
glass dolls.&quot; Betty said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but remember it was the male lion's duty to protect territory while the female's to <br />
hunt. A male who hunted was considered odd in the head. A female who defended the <br />
territory was much the same.... And by befriending themselves to the next generation of <br />
the lupmans and leomans, the three of them began to build up their own little cult, while <br />
their fellow humans continued to be fodder for their experiments in creating immortality <br />
and total freedom from Law.  And as each turned eighteen, both performed their own <br />
ceremony in direct mockery of the confirmation they had gone through the motions of but <br />
never in heart and took new names on their eighteen birthdays.&quot;  <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
As Millie did her hardest to drown out the casual chat about sex (she had enough of that <br />
from her sisters) the nurses were taking in updates from Tab, the Yorks and the Glens.<br />
<br />
Joy's awake middle head said, &quot;Too bad more of the Pack can't be here to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ingrid's own awake head said, &quot;Don't even joke, the last thing we need is more <br />
complications.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle from her place on the table had to agree. Even with her mind fully open to the <br />
estate and the emotions and thoughts of the various lupmen and leomen present, she was <br />
struggling to keep them all straight and orderly. <br />
<br />
Amber meanwhile as she ate breakfast was glade she didn't endure the playful and even <br />
well meaning teasing from her half-sisters like Millie did hers. The NOT identical fraternal <br />
twins Ruby and Emerald never teased the nearly thirteen Amber about her short height for <br />
a lupman and her lack of other features. Amber had seen took much of the Japanese <br />
lupmans to lament too much about her fate or wish for a bigger chest. She remembered <br />
when she had spoke her envy to Eri, and the golden japanese woman had taken her aside <br />
and spoken to her very harshly and very precisely about the trouble she endured from her <br />
own features. She even strapped two heavy weights to Amber's chest for a day to get her <br />
point across. Amber had never complained again. <br />
<br />
'Garnet' sympathized with Amber, having her own share of bad luck over the years. As for <br />
Coral and Tourmaline... the half-sisters cousins (their mothers had been sisters though all <br />
six had the same father) at least didn't fill the stereotypical pink lupman traits (which were <br />
the equal to human blonds). <br />
<br />
Amber just wondered when the next letter from their mothers and father would come.. and <br />
how to explain to them EVERYTHING that had happened since the Alphas' first born had <br />
gotten their hot little paws on a turn of the game!</p>
