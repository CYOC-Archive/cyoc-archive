<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ride from the college to the hospital was as quick as possible, though it didn&#39;t feel quite as quick as it in fact was. Jenny felt guilty over the whole issue, that her lover&#39;s family was suffering because of Dieter Wilhelm and his obsession with her and the fact that her parents never saw Dieter for the scum that he was. Her younger siblings never really saw Dieter around that much, thankfully because Jenny managed to make sure that her past interactions with Dieter were always away from home. Her elder brother did pick up on Dieter&#39;s failings, but that was only AFTER Dieter had totaled his first car after getting drunk, but by that point there wasn&#39;t anything that he could do. And now he&#39;d sent people to try and kill Harry, which frustrated her to no end, and one of them had nearly killed her mate&#39;s brother.<br />
<br />
However, her own guilt had to wait, as Jenny felt herself needing to comfort Harry. He looked beside himself as he looked out the window and then down at his hands, across the seat to Akane, who was riding with them in the car, and then back out the window again. Occasionally Jenny heard him say something, usually something that related his brother, and she knew she&#39;d need to be there for him. To help him, as she knew that Harry had had a good relationship with his family and his brother was nice. Jenny in fact liked Huck based on their meeting. There had to be something she could say to assure Harry and as she pondered this matter, the fact that she still had her scheduled therapy session slipped her mind completely. She felt she was doing well enough with her own mental recovery from her delayed transition from Normal to Werefox. If Huck died, however, the Jenkins family would receive a blow they couldn&#39;t easily recover from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huck was always good to me,&quot; Harry said to her, &quot;taught me a lot... really showed me that there was nothing truly scary about weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was certainly nice to me when we met,&quot; Jenny commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were best friends growing up,&quot; Harry stated, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Jenny spoke, not truly sure on what to say, &quot;the hospital staff will do all they can to save him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry gave a weak smile to Jenny as he felt her hands on his, rubbing his hands as if to say &quot;everything will be fine.&quot; Things didn&#39;t necessarily feel fine, but the assurance from Jenny counted for plenty. Harry was glad to have her in his life, as he knew he&#39;d never recover if Huck died and Jenny wasn&#39;t there to give him comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for everything,&quot; Harry said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only wish I could do more,&quot; Jenny told him and continued to hold Harry&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Akane blinked at that, but said nothing. Despite her suspicions that Jenny was a mystical healer based on old scrolls that had been in hers and her husband&#39;s possession, Akane knew that there would be plenty of skepticism among those who weren&#39;t familiar with it already. Even weres at times doubted that mysticism played any role in being weres and pointed to good evidence that supported their claims. Even if she told Jenny what she thought or suspected and Jenny believed her, the hospital wouldn&#39;t let her just barge into an operating room. And even if every were DID believe in it, that would still be hard to determine fully on whether or not Jenny actually was the one identified in the scroll. If enough proof came about that confirmed things beyond a shadow of a doubt, then things could go further. <br />
<br />
&quot;One never knows what they can do until they do it,&quot; Akane did comment, &quot;and even if all we can do now is hope... it can do surprising things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huck will be fine,&quot; Jenny assured Harry again and nodded in agreement with the Skulk&#39;s leader.<br />
<br />
They continued to ride along until they came to the front of the hospital. The driver pulled quietly into one of the waiting spaces, and as Jenny and Harry climbed out, they were surprised to see Akane getting out as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know... do you know Huck, Mrs. Tachibana?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No personally, no,&quot; Akane admitted, &quot;but this situation falls within the Skulk&#39;s responsibility and our collective guilt for Yvette Smith&#39;s actions. To make up for that, we will make sure the two of you are happy... and we will do our best to care for your brother, young Mr. Jenkins. I will walk you in and the hospital staff with escort you to where you may wait for any news they have for you on your brother&#39;s condition. I will then proceed to the Hospital&#39;s billing department and make sure that his bills are paid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harry said in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; cam an older voice, making Harry and Jenny turn.<br />
<br />
They looked to see Henry Jenkins Senior and Lisa Jenkins moving as fast as they could manage. The car that had brought them presently parked just behind the car that had brought Harry and Jenny. Harry noted his father&#39;s nervous look and the fact that his mother had been crying a bit at the news, and knew he wasn&#39;t the only one worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Tachibana has offered to pay for Huck&#39;s treatment,&quot; Harry said after a moment, feeling Jenny hold him tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s very generous,&quot; Henry said slowly, holding Lisa to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know anything?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know nothing more than you at this time,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;but I would hope that things are well. Let us go in and have hope for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded, and they made their way in. They moved cautiously to the front desk and Akane introduced Jenny and the Jenkins family and that they were there to check in on Henry Jenkins Jr. while she dealt with his billing issues. The front desk clerk checked a few things quickly and then directed Akane to the billing office nearby and gave the Jenkins the directions to the waiting room near the operating room. Harry thanked her and lead Jenny along with Henry and Lisa as they made their way through the hospital. After awhile they came up toward the door to that waiting room and both Jenny and Harry actually hear distraught sobbing coming from inside the waiting room. Harry looked to Jenny, who only shrugged.<br />
<br />
Harry opened the door was surprised to find a slightly older looking normal woman seated in a chair, he head in her hands, and sobbing as though her whole world had ended. Eventually, though, Harry recognized her. She was one of Huck&#39;s employees and he thought that she had been a friend of his when they were at Moon Lake High School together. He thought her name was Betty. She looked up when she heard the door open, her eyes red with tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty?&quot; Henry spoke as he recognized her quicker than the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... sir... it... it...&quot; Betty sniffled, &quot;it was horrible... I came in early, like I always do... and... ho... and then I heard a loud bang. I... I came out and Huck was on the ground... face down... in blood... oh there was so much blood!&quot;<br />
<br />
For the moment, Betty dropped back into uncontrollable sobs. Harry was somewhat puzzled and looked to his father who only shrugged. Both of them were concerned and nervous over what would happen to Huck, but no where near this level. Henry in fact even thought that Lisa had taken the report that Huck had been shot than Betty had. Lisa, however, moved forward and despite her own worries over her eldest son, moved and placed a hand on Betty&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love him, don&#39;t you dear?&quot; Lisa said to Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... we&#39;re friends... I...&quot; Betty answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Harry asked. &quot;Lisa?&quot; Henry asked at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;A mother can tell these things,&quot; Lisa commented, &quot;Betty was Huck&#39;s first friend here in Moon Lake and they did just about everything together, even after Huck became the family were. And often... particularly while they were in High School, I&#39;d come home to find them doing homework together... and Betty here was often looking to Huck. Made me think there was something there, though nothing ever came from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was... I was never brave enough to ask him,&quot; Betty sobbed and then gripped Lisa, &quot;and now I may never get the chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he make it into surgery?&quot; Lisa asked her and rubbed Betty&#39;s shoulders for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;They took him there the instant we arrived about thirty minutes ago,&quot; Betty answered weakly, &quot;by now they&#39;ve probably X-Rayed him and know precisely where to stitch him up... the doctor used a lot of big words...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he say he&#39;d report when he&#39;d finished whatever surgery he needs to do?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Betty said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we can only wait and hope for good news,&quot; Lisa said to Betty, &quot;and we can do it together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Betty said weakly.</p>
