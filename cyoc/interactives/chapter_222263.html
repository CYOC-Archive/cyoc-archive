<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Very far away, in a completely different world, Adam and Cecil fell down from a magical portal that began to close as soon as it spat out the two brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Adam yelped as he landed on hard ground. &quot;I knew we shouldn&#39;t have trusted that goblin...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh! It&#39;s closing up!&quot; Cecil shrieked in panic, pointing at the rapidly dissolving portal. The last vestiges of light emanating from it disappeared and the brothers were left pitch dark. &quot;How are we gonna get back home now?! Where are we?! It&#39;s so dark! I can&#39;t see anything!&quot; He panicked, feeling scared ever since the goblin had shown them his true colors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t panic Cecil, there&#39;s a faint light over there. We just have to let our eyes adapt to this low-light environment.&quot; Adam swallowed hard. Adapt? Didn&#39;t the goblin say something about the portal adapting their bodies to their new world? Whatever that meant?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re right, I see it! It&#39;s some kind of lightbulb...&quot; Cecil began to slowly walk towards the feeble light. &quot;Oh, wait, it isn&#39;t a lightbulb. It&#39;s actually a very old-fashioned torch. It gets warmer the closer I get to it, and it kinda makes it difficult to breathe compared to a flashlight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam hadn&#39;t realized until now, but the place was not only dark but very cold and humid. He could do with the warmth of a torch. He walked towards the torch but just then he felt a bit dizzy and collapsed to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Bro? Are you feeling alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine really, just a bit of a headache- ARGH!&quot; Adam brought his hands to his head in pain. He felt pain in his entire head but the ache on his ears and his nose were especially terrible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, must&#39;ve been the fall.&quot; Cecil said as he helped his older brother stand back up. &quot;Do you need... Ah ... AHHHHH!&quot; Cecil&#39;s mouth fell agape in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Adam could feel the pain in all of his head rapidly dissipating. &quot;Am I bleeding or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re not bleeding...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does the bruise look bad then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Not exactly a bruise...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam didn&#39;t know what Cecil was trying to get at. He scratched his ear and... Woah!<br />
<br />
&quot;What... the fuck happened to my ears?!&quot; Adam panicked. His ears were gigantic! They were almost bigger than his face! And their shape was pointy just like Jarg, that traitorous goblin&#39;s... &quot;Don&#39;t tell me I have goblin ears?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Oh shit! How am I gonna explain this to my friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cecil stared right at the center of his brother&#39;s face. That&#39;s when Adam realized he was seeing a big green appendage dangling right below his eyes. &quot;AAHHHH!!! Not a big green nose, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t panic Cecil but... Your whole face is green.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck what am I gonna do...&quot; Adam brought his hands to the top of his head in despair. When he removed them, he realized he was holding on to strands of fallen hair. &quot;FUCK NO. Not my hair as well!&quot; Adam&#39;s hair which he always kept meticulously cleaned and hydrated with the most expensive brand of shampoo was falling down in droves! &quot;Noooo! I&#39;m going bald!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-that&#39;s not true! You still have some tufts of hair there in the center, and also some stray facial hair that you forgot to shave this morning... So you&#39;re not bald, see?&quot; Cecil tried in an attempt to console his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s gone...&quot; Adam looked at the hair he was holding with hands... Hands that were increasing disproportionally in size, with his fingers becoming leathery green and his nails becoming the size of claws.<br />
<br />
His feet went through a similar transformation, his toes ripping apart the sneakers he had been wearing. &quot;Oh crap!&quot; Adam had no choice but to sit down and remove the tattered remains of his shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
The moment he stood up, something felt off. Adam had always felt envious of Cecil being slightly taller than him, but now their difference was astronomical! &quot;AHHHHH! I&#39;m fucking shrinking!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cecil could only look in awe as his brother&#39;s torso, arms and legs shrunk beneath his clothes. His hands, feet and head remained their size, making Adam look like an extremely disproportionate and exaggerated caricature of himself.<br />
<br />
Adam crawled out of his loose shirt and jacket, revealing his green, slim and a bit boney torso. His dark green male nipples looked too large and perky on his flat chest as if he needed yet another exaggerated feature on his mockery of a body.<br />
<br />
His pants were too large for him. Trying to walk with these overly long pants was too awkward. He thought about using his newly-acquired sharp claws to make shorts out of them but he ended up damaging them too much and he ended up just throwing them away in frustration.<br />
<br />
The only piece of clothing that still fit him was his white briefs... In fact, his humongous bulge decidedly was one of the parts of him that had NOT shrunk...<br />
<br />
Embarrassingly enough as it was, Adam had no choice but to get used to walking around in just his tighty whities. It was better than being nude although he was packing an obscenely large bulge inside them.<br />
<br />
As Adam&#39;s transformation seemed to end, he felt very frustrated by his changes.<br />
<br />
He was very short, too skinny, too disproportionate. He was sure he couldn&#39;t have been transformed into anything worse. He felt lost, disoriented and cold in just his underwear.<br />
<br />
Cecil hadn&#39;t said anything for a few minutes, and Adam thought he was keeping his distance... Maybe his new goblin body scared him? Probably, he looked so ugly now. Cecil must be feeling very ashamed of his brother...<br />
<br />
But to Adam&#39;s surprise, Cecil wouldn&#39;t stop looking back at him, staring at him from up and down with curiosity and excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro! You&#39;re completely goblin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m hideous...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? You look awesome! My brother is a real asskicking goblin! I feel like I&#39;m inside one of my fantasy books! You look so genuine!&quot; Cecil said, rocking his upper body in glee. He was very curious about his brother&#39;s new body. &quot;Your skin looks so green and leathery, I wonder what it feels like to the touch...!&quot; He said, and he was about to put his finger on Adam&#39;s shoulder, but he felt a bit awkward, feeling like that would be treating his big bro like a guinea pig and in the end he didn&#39;t even touch him at all. &quot;Sorry, I always get too excited when it comes to fantasy stuff. Haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cecil didn&#39;t need to explain himself. Adam knew very well that his little brother had very strong fixations in the stuff he liked and now that Adam was a goblin from a fantasy world he had become the living embodiment of one of his brother&#39;s interests. He didn&#39;t like being a goblin but he felt glad at least Cecil accepted him after his transfiguration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it&#39;s because of what Jarg said? That the portal adapts people to their new surroundings?&quot; Cecil asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so...&quot; Adam replied feeling pensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I can see, we&#39;re in some sort of cave or underground mine, judging by the walls filled to the brim with ore. There&#39;s a few rail tracks over there, maybe from some minecart? Are those to transport minerals only or can we ride them? Hehe this feels like a video game I played long ago.&quot; Cecil was getting excited again. &quot;I still can&#39;t tell if we&#39;re actually in another world though. The only thing for sure is that there must be goblins here judging by your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be right...&quot; Adam said. He was still pensive but what was nagging his goblin brain wasn&#39;t their current whereabouts but Cecil. If the magic of the portal had finished reshaping Adam, would Cecil now begin to be transfigured now, just like his big brother? And into what?<br />
<br />
Adam decided not to lose sight of Cecil while they investigated the mine, just in case he&#39;d transform without warning...</p>
