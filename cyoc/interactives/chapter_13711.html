<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mark watched in growing horror, his older brother Tony, the gigantic gorilla, pulled his girlfriend, an average sized female gorilla close to him.  He almost seemed to kiss her with his slick black lips.  And worse, she seemed to receive his simian affections quite enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no.  I've gotta stop this, quick&quot; gasped Mark.  Tony couldn't control his lust and in a few minutes, he would force Claire to remain a gorilla for the length of a gorilla pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Mark's fingers flew across the keyboard.  A change to a registered profile was one of the simpler transformations and he navigated the necessary menus as fast as possible.  Tony and Claire were beyond the recommended range for use of the Chronivac, some fifty feet, but Mark had to try.  He held the laptop and emitter up against the bars and hit enter.  What the heck, he thought.  He hit enter again.<br />
<br />
Tony was fighting desperately to control his massive new body.  Unlike when fighting the former alpha male, Tony's reasoning mind was completely in the back seat, now.  He nearly screamed commands to leave Claire alone, warning that to fuck her and get her pregnant would have terrible repercussions.  Yet, he couldn't seem to lift a finger or to stop a finger.  And though completely unable to command his gorilla body against its sexual will, he still felt every single sensation of it.  He felt his slick black lips rubbing pleasantly against hers.  He saw, with horror, the look of adoration and lust in her eyes.  He felt the oddly pleasing gorilla contours of her body as he pawed at her and groped her.  He could feel his gorilla penis becoming completely erect as her turned her around and despite himself, the tingle felt terrific.  It was as he was turning her around to thrust into her wet, waiting simian pussy that Tony felt the familiar electric wave pass through his 700 pound gorilla body.  <br />
<br />
In just a moment, Tony started shrinking.  He could feel his head reshaping and his hands and feet becoming smaller while he rapidly lost his tremendous muscle mass.  The process dulled his lust and he only thrust once but something went awry then, too.<br />
<br />
The second burst from the emitter had struck Claire.  All at once, her memories came back to her, of Tony, Jeff, Jack, Mark, Eric and the chronivac.  She realized that her gorilla fate was not some inexplicable fate dealt by an insane universe.  It must have been the chronivac.  And she realized that the electric wave that had just passed through her heralded a transformation coming from the chronivac.  Bent over a thick fallen tree, as Tony had positioned her, she could see his brother Mark at the spectators' overlook with a laptop computer.<br />
<br />
With delight, Claire felt herself shrinking back to human proportion.  She saw and felt hair disappearing off her body and smooth, perfect skin emerging.  But she felt something else happening to her body, too and when she looked down at her velvety soft human skin, she saw no breasts, but two tight squares of pectoral muscle.  She didn't see a slender hourglass shaped torso, but a V shaped torso that narrowed from wide shoulders to a narrow waist.  And below that small waist, she saw not her thin V shaped bush but a curly tuft of pubic hair above a thick, long penis.<br />
&quot;Oh my god&quot; Claire blurted out as she realized what was happening and she heard not her voice but Tony's deep, resonant bass.  She looked at her long fingered hands and rubbed one over her head.  She felt not her shoulder length brunette tresses but Tony's quarter inch long close cropped cut.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; She let out a deep voiced yelp as Tony's penis slammed into her new anus but could not fit.  Clair looked over her shoulder and saw Tony, still partly ape finish transforming back into his real self.  <br />
<br />
Tony pulled Claire upright and turned her around.  &quot;I'm sorry.  I-I couldn't control my . . . what the?!  You're me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony looked angrily over at Mark by the fence.  But before he could say anything, Mark shouted &quot;Get out of there, now!  We'll fix it later!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire wasn't quite so frantic, though, she chuckled looking at her new male body.  &quot;So this is what it's like?&quot; she smirked.<br />
&quot;That is so weird to hear you speaking with my voice&quot; said Tony.<br />
&quot;I always liked your voice&quot; said Claire.  &quot;So deep and strong, just like this new ass&quot; she laughed patting her new buns.  &quot;And this . .!&quot;<br />
she laughed turning her hips just enough to make her big new cock swing back and forth.  &quot;I had no idea . . !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright.  It's all a lot of fun.  We've gotta get out of here.  Now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Lead the way&quot; said Claire.  &quot;You know what this bod can do better than I do&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony saw, looking back, that the gorillas, who were fascinated by the change of their new alpha male into a human, were now just feeling some mixture of curiosity and anger that a human was in their territory.  A couple of them were slowly advancing on Tony and ClaireTony.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This way!&quot; said Tony and he climbed down from the edge of the plateau where they stood.  The plateau had been formed by stacking boulders and though it was a tough climb down, it was manageable for a Tony or two.  Once down to the base of the habitat, Tony and his girlfriend/doppelganger sprinted across the 50 feet of open ground to the base of the wall leading up to the spectators' overlook.  They climbed up off the ground just as another pair of curious/angry gorillas was approaching.  This climb was even more difficult as this wall had been intended to be impossible for the gorillas to climb.  There were very few handholds to make use of in the stone and mortar surface they scaled.  But Tony found enough that he was able to make it almost all the way to the top.  There, the very top of the wall overhung the rest of it.  He had to have Claire give a push to his buns to help him get over the edge.  Once there, he offered a hand down to Claire and helped pull his girlfriend, in an exact naked copy of his own body, up over the edge.  <br />
<br />
Next, they scaled the 6 foot high, black iron fence at the edge of the spectators' overlook and dropped down to the pavement.  There, waiting for the two identical naked male models was . .</p>
