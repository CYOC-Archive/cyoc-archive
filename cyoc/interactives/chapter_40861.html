<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The twins along Ty and Dustin took the elevator and went down to the school's pool. They talked and laughed until they entered the locker room. Then there was a silence.<br />
The locker room was full of bullies. Most of them were taller than the twins and very muscular, and some of them were fat but with a lot of strength too. Mark and Andrew quickly recognized all of them, they never let the twins go to the pool when they were swimming.<br />
Fortunately, that day everything was about to change. Mark and Andrew had now the widest body in the room, and they were the strongest kid with no doubt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we have here?&quot; one bully wearing a black Speedo walked to the twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you remember us? We are Mark...&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and Andrew.&quot; Andrew continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know who you are, silly kids. What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, our bodies merged into one. Now we have to share the same body.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we got extra muscles. We are superstrong now, maybe we are the strongest man in this room.&quot; Andrew said as the twins flexed their biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; the bully said as he walked around Mark and Andrew. &quot;You are right. Maybe you are the strongest here. But you will never win all of us even with this weird body. So if you thought you were going to intimidate us, you were wrong. Go away, freak. We don't want monsters in OUR pool. Hahaha!!!&quot; he laughed. Then all the bullies laughed with him too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Repeat that!&quot; Mark and Andrew said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a monster! Haha!&quot; the bully said. &quot;Look guys! Take a look at their big ass, it's huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true. In order to fit two heads in the same body, the whole body had to become wider. So they had a big back. All bullies laughed. Mark and Andrew felt very bad. They were about to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey twins...&quot; Ty whispered while the bullies were laughing. &quot;I can't split you again into two kids, then I can turn you into two huge bodybuilders. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Andrew whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Ty, but we love being like this. We know that we are not a monster.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. However, you can help us in another way.&quot; Andrew continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok guys. Leave alone this two-head freak. Let's go.&quot; the bully said, and all his friends followed him to the pool. The twins, Ty and Dustin were alone now in the locker room.<br />
<br />
Mark and Andrew smiled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;While they were laughing at us, we counted all of them.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and they are even.&quot; Andrew said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what does it mean?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what it means!&quot; Ty said smiling. &quot;And I think it's a great idea! Ok, twins. Take off all your clothes, even your Speedo. You won't need it.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? We can't go naked like that!&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry. I will grant your wish, but I'll do it my way.&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Ty. We will do it. We trust you.&quot; Andrew said.<br />
<br />
The twins took off all their clothes quickly. Dustin stared at the boys' body. They had the body of a young Greek god. They did not feel embarrased, in fact they loved being so important in that moment. They smiled and did some poses while naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. It's all ready. You can go to the pool now.&quot; Ty said. &quot;Oh, and don't worry about being naked.&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
The twins walked to the door and as soon they went through it, they felt how his body was changing. His two legs merged into one, and blue scales started to appear in all his lower body. They were turning into a merboy! They quickly got the fish part that mermaids have, and then two big crowns also appeared on their heads.<br />
Their body now was unable to walk, so they had to drag theirselves across the ground. Fortunately, all their muscles were intact. In fact, they even grew a bit more. Now they were a huge merboy with two heads.<br />
They dragged theirselves to the pool, where the bullies were still laughing about Mark and Andrew. One of them turned back and saw the two headed merboy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe! Look guys!&quot; he said. &quot;Now they even look weirder!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bully started to laugh, but at the same time his body started to move slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I can't move! My body is moving alone!&quot; he said scared. Then he noticed that another bully was suffering the same. Their bodies were getting neared, they tried to escape, but it was impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are going to crash!&quot; one of them said when their Speedo bulges touched each other.<br />
<br />
A white flash light appeared then, and blinded everyone in the pool. When Mark and Andrew were able to open their eyes they could not believe what they were seeing.<br />
<br />
In the place were the two bullies collided, there was a little merboy with two heads. The merboy body and his heads seemed to be 12 years old. They had a very muscular body too, but Mark and Andrew were still stronger and bigger. In fact, the new merboy that appeared there was younger than the twins.<br />
The heads of the merboy looked at their new body. What happened there? The bullies tried to escape, but soon their bodies started to move back and crash with other bullies, creating more and more muscular two head merboys. After some seconds, every bully was merged<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the two head merboy kingdom!&quot; a voice sounded behind the twins.<br />
<br />
Mark and Andrew turned back and saw another merboy! It was Ty and Dustin merged in the same body. Dustin had to regress to match Ty's age, but they were not younger like the bullies. They headed to the water and jumped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for? You are the kings, come to the water and enjoy it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Ty!&quot; Mark and Andrew said at the same time and jumped to the water. They felt like a real fish, and they learnt to swim, move and breath underwater easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;We only wanted to merge them into two head boys like us.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but this is even funnier!&quot; Andrew said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please pay attention our merboys!&quot; Mark and Andrew said at the same time when all the young merboys jumped to the water too.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on, every bully who tries to enter the pool will have to go with a friend in order to enter.&quot; Andrew said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, automatically your bodies will merge and turn into a two head merboy.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are your kings, but we are not going to take advantage of you like you did when you were bullies. We want all of you to enjoy this new life while we are on the school's pool.&quot; they said.<br />
<br />
The merboys quickly understood and started to play underwater, Ty and Dustin enjoyed it too.</p>
