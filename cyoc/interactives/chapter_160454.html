<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The couple walked away from the restaurant, hand in hand. Kendall thought back to how she had used the Chronivac to change those two waiters. It felt truly cathartic, knowing they were to soon receive the punishment she&#39;d designed. She&#39;d never realized she had such a twisted sense of humor. It almost worried her, but it wasn&#39;t like they didn&#39;t deserve it. They needed to learn a lesson or two. She would never hurt innocent people,  like her innocent boyfriend currently holding her hand. She squeezed his hand. He squeezed back, looked at her and smiled warmly at her. He was meant for her and she was meant for him. She wouldn&#39;t let this mess pull them apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry babe, someone is calling me.&quot; Connor announced.<br />
<br />
Kendall felt a sense of dread, being reminded of the phone call she just had with the mysterious man. She dearly hoped this man wasn&#39;t contacting Connor too.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I don&#39;t understand. What are you even talking about?&quot; Connor spoke into the phone.<br />
<br />
He lowered the phone back into his pocket. That was a short conversation, hopefully it was just a telemarketer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who was it?&quot; she asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Josie.&quot; he replied &quot;She asked me weird questions, and when I answered her, she just stopped speaking, then she hung up. What&#39;s her deal. I hope she isn&#39;t planning on making me a girl again. I thought we had resolved this..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck.&quot; Kendall thought to herself. This was bad. Josie must have already realized something was wrong. She had to immediately deal with both Josie and Jenna. They couldn&#39;t know that she also got a Chronivac too. Even if she was immune to changes herself, there&#39;s no telling what they could do to harm her or those around her. She had to act before they realized anything more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor. I forgot something at the restaurant. Wait here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll come along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Wait here!&quot; she yelled at him.<br />
<br />
She ran, leaving a puzzled Connor behind. Once she got around a couple of corners, out of his sight, she opened up the Chronivac app on her phone. She pulled up Josie&#39;s and Jenna&#39;s profiles, and got herself a surprise. It was unexpected, yet it explained a lot. There were numerous transformations in their history, probably explained by sexual deviancy. Them being distasteful perverts wasn&#39;t the shocking part. What surprised her was finding that Josie hadn&#39;t always been named Josie. She&#39;d used the Chronivac to become a girl. Previously &quot;she&quot; was a boy named Jeff, and now he was prancing around as if he had always been a girl. Absolutely disgusting. What a creepy pervert. No wonder &quot;she&quot; was so interested in turning Connor female.<br />
<br />
Kendall couldn&#39;t let those gross deviants have access to something this powerful. She had to do something. There was no easy option, no simple button she could press to remove their device. She could delete their knowledge of the Chronivac, but then they could just rediscover it, making it just a temporary solution.<br />
<br />
Kendall could turn remove their humanity. She could make them petty houseflies, letting them fly around a few days until their short lifespan came at an end. No. She would never do that. That&#39;s the equivalent of murder. She wasn&#39;t a monster. The surefire way to resolve this without killing Josie and Jenna, or &quot;Jeff&quot; and Jenna, was to physically destroy their Chronivac. All she needed was to know where it is, and to temporarily disarm them.<br />
<br />
A plan formed in Kendall&#39;s head. What better way to discover their Chronivac&#39;s location than to just have them tell her. She edited both of Josie&#39;s and Jenna&#39;s profiles, making it so that they were completely infatuated with her and fully trusting of her. She applied the changes.<br />
<br />
Kendall felt her stomach twist. She had messed with their heads, with their emotions. Changing their physical bodies was one thing, but having the power to intrude into a mind, meddling with their very being, it made her shiver. She should hurry up and find them, then she could revert this necessary mental change and instead figure out a fitting, but less intrusive punishment for them. Their location was displayed. They were at Josie&#39;s house. She was about to look up the address for directions, but then she got interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kendall, what&#39;s going on?&quot; she heard Connor&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
Turning around, Connor was standing right behind her. Had he seen what she was doing on her phone? That would have been a disaster. He couldn&#39;t have. He wasn&#39;t the type of person to spy at another&#39;s cellphone. He probably called her for her as soon she entered his vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing. I was just walking back to you right now.&quot; she lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You took so long. I was worried something had happened with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing happened. My mom called me and I stopped to talk with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay. As long as you&#39;re alright I&#39;m happy. Babe, if something is bothering you, please talk with me. I&#39;m your boyfriend you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve just been off today. I think I am a little bit sick. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was Connor suspicious? She&#39;d been tense ever since she discovered the mess Connor was in. It was natural that he was worried with how she&#39;d been acting. She wanted to ease his worries, spend more time with him, but first, she had to resolve this mess.</p>
