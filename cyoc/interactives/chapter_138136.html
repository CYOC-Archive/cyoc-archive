<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sophie and Roland were quite pleased when they did make it back to Lyre/Animalia after sitting out the &quot;Storm from Nowhere&quot; that hit the area in Florida near Skull Island. It had cost them a few days and meant that they missed the first day of school at WSA for their Junior Year, something they had very much wanted to see because it would finally be the sort of school that would show on what Animalia wanted and would work toward, full acceptance and comfort for all parties involved. But the storm had gotten in the way of that, but the storm did pass and they were able to return home.<br />
<br />
The welcome home had been a bit unexpected. Their parents had been busy working at the time when their flight landed on a Saturday afternoon, but the rest of Animalia Ambassadoria was there, which soon lead to the &quot;embarrassing&quot; discovery that Sophie and Roland had had sex while in Florida. Sarah, Travis, Simon, and Malice were the ones who picked it up first, and largely through their greater sense of smell that gave an indication that even after showering before their flight out of Florida, the scent of sex was still on them. Sophie wanted to blush even harder with embarrassment when JC and Pauline presented the celebratory &quot;cake,&quot; mostly made out of cooked fish cakes which included the message, &quot;Happy First Time&quot; written on it, which betrayed that her friends actually expected what happened to happen.<br />
<br />
Sophie tried to explain that it just sort of happened and that she couldn&#39;t really resist that urge once they got started, but that didn&#39;t mean there still wasn&#39;t some teasing. Thankfully though, her friends were supportive on the whole thing. Jessica might be a bit curious on something, but she was just as supportive as the others. That let her move on and get ready for what would be her first day at a new school, which would come with it&#39;s own challenges, namely catching up with what she missed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t gotten started on too much,&quot; the biology teacher said to Sophie as she came in for their first period class as she went along with a couple cabinets to get the books that the Pterodactylus Dinotopian would need for the class, &quot;But with what happened in that storm, you WILL need to catch up on some things. Talk with a friend on catching up on notes and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Sophie nodded as she accepted the book and began filling it out while the teacher went near to the front to collect something from the desk. Once finished filling out the instructed &quot;check in&quot; blocks, Sophie then followed the teacher, who then presented her with a worksheet, which was likely one of the first assignments given for the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;And with the storm... I won&#39;t require this to be turned in today, but I will expect it finished by tomorrow,&quot; the teacher instructed, &quot;as there will be a lot that we&#39;ll be working on through the semester.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Sophie repeated and accepted the worksheet and then slid it into a random page in the book while then turning to take an open seat in the classroom.<br />
<br />
Inwardly, Sophie couldn&#39;t help but smile, as the classroom was mixed with both Humans and Animalians setting about getting their day started. She could see Abby and Samson together with a human student, Danica seated next to Abby and engaging in some small talk while everyone waited for Sophie to finish her initial business with the teacher in getting the materials she&#39;d need for the class. It was something she figured was what Animalia was for, for the greatest issues that larger Animalians had run into at Lyre High was that much of the building&#39;s infrastructure hadn&#39;t been ready for an influx of students that were bigger than humans, particularly those that were double dosed. WSA provided the opportunity to fix that problem, as the tables and chairs could go up or down to suit the sizes of the Animalians or humans in question, and could be easily adjusted. They were strong and sturdy, benefitting those with greater muscle mass, while still retaining a degree of comfort for smaller Animalians, and thus Humans as well. <br />
<br />
In this, while there was plenty to catch up on, Sophie was pleased. She made her way to an open seat and sat down to begin the day.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And both Sophie and Roland had had some activities that went through many of their morning classes. In general there was some catchup work that was required to get material and so on, which had to be collected because of the days they missed because of the storm in Florida, but for the most part, things went fairly well. They&#39;d have a lot of homework to make up, but a lot of that was to be expected. Thankfully by third period, they had a class that likely wouldn&#39;t have much in the way of homework, PE, and one that came right before a shared free period for both Sophie and Roland. It was also a class that they shared with Travis, Sarah, and Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Sarah asked as she closed her locker in the locker-room and set the padlock for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we think about what?&quot; Roland asked as he looked over to them as they got ready for the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;About WSA so far?&quot; Sarah asked, playfully shaking Sophie&#39;s shoulder before squeezing into her sports bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far... pretty good,&quot; Sophie answered as she finished pulling up her exercise shorts and feeling fairly calm with things. There were a few Human students that might be a bit nervous/embarrassed over things, but then she figured that many Human girls would have the potential to be jealous of double dosed female Animalians like Sarah and Malice and boys with amorous feelings might either misjudge Animalian sexuality and assume everything was a free invitation while others might feel inadequate. In fact after Travis joined their group at Lyre High in their freshman year, and particularly after Sarah gave him his second dose, it seemed that even Travis as a single dosed Animalian felt inadequate next to Sarah. <br />
<br />
However, she&#39;d been close friends with Sarah, Jessica, and Abby for years, and after Malice was uplifted, Sophie had gotten fairly used to many of the things that made Animalia rather unique. She also privately figured that after she became a Pterodactylus Dinotopian at the start of the previous summer, that many of Animalia&#39;s cultural norms and desires were a part of her too. In some ways she couldn&#39;t really deny that too hard, given how quick things had progressed between her and Roland during the Storm from Nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then we were both here for the tour when WSA was first built,&quot; Sophie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And having EVERYONE together is something that is a good thing,&quot; Roland added as they began to make their way out of the locker room and toward the gym, &quot;Show that Animalians are in control of themselves and that everyone can be comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then you can sign your names on the bricks,&quot; Malice said with a grin, earning face palms from both Sophie and Roland.<br />
<br />
Sophie had no personal regrets at having sex with Roland. She loved him dearly, and in their short time together, even while they were human, he&#39;d displayed a great deal of willingness to do things that otherwise she wouldn&#39;t imagine someone doing. After their conversion, those feelings of love and attraction grew stronger, but at the same time, she also had to privately admit that they&#39;d both been caught by surprise and that she wasn&#39;t going to go out of her way to have sex just because she was an Animalian herself, now.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Everyone did manage to gather in the gym for the start of the PE class on time. In this, it&#39;s size was something that was most impressive to Sophie. Like many other school gymnasiums, it had a basketball court with folding sets of bleachers, which Sophie figured was probably part of preparations for either when there were enough Animalians living throughout Nevada, not just in Lyre/Animalia, which would then mean that they&#39;d be ready for school sports like Volleyball and Basketball, but that was likely something for the distant future. However the biggest thing was that the area actually stood well higher than the old gym in Lyre and had attached other rooms for specialized exercises which ranged from weights to swimming. <br />
<br />
It presented something of the &quot;total experience&quot; that Sophie couldn&#39;t help but marvel at. In a way it went beyond what Sophie had seen in school before and left her fairly eager to see how PE classes were handled with all these extras. In this she found herself half paying attention as Marlysa ran that class period as she looked around. She answered when her name was called and went through with the preliminary stretches, but was still more enamored with looking around, almost as if she was interested in looking around. She eventually snapped out of it by Roland shaking her. As she &quot;came to&quot; she found him and Marlysa standing over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that flyers are to go to flyer&#39;s perch,&quot; Marlysa instructed pointing to a far corner of the gym where many of the flying Animalians were already gathered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sophie said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s understandable as this is your first day as a student,&quot; Marlysa answered, &quot;but we have a busy year ahead of us and we&#39;re still going through some of the basics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland both nodded while then making their way toward where the &quot;flyer&#39;s perch&quot; was. It was in the back corner of the gym and was a series of platforms that were high enough up that they would be well above many of the activities going on at ground level. From the ground, there was a male Robin Animalian looking over things with the bird and bat Animalians waiting at one of the ledges waiting for them. As they got closer, both Sophie and Roland went through the different manner of take off that Pterosaurs used from Birds. Birds would typically jump with their legs while using their wings to then pull them into the air afterward. Pterosaurs would literally use their wings in a powerful pushup to essentially catapult themselves into the air before taking flight from there.<br />
<br />
Flying up to the ledge was ultimately fairly easy, as was landing. However, both Sophie and Roland found that flying in the gym was very different from flying outside. The buildings circulation did allow for the movement of air, but it was circulated in a way that was pretty steady and uniform, something that didn&#39;t go on outside. It was something that both Sophie and Roland had figured out during their lessons with Norrie Simus, Animalia&#39;s only other Pterosaur at the moment, that they could feel just about any shift in wind direction or any updraft or downdraft along their wings. It was something that almost let them fly entirely by touch once in the air. The more uniform movement of air inside the gymnasium was a bit different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awfully awkward for a take off,&quot; one of the of the waiting Animalians, a Red Tailed Hawk Animalian commented as Sophie and Roland landed. Sophie thought his name was Locke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not awkward, different,&quot; Sophie answered as she looked to him, noting his fiery red hair on his head, showing that he was a converted human and not an uplifted animal. &quot;On the ground, Pterosaurs were quadrupeds and since they had shorter rear legs, it is not like they could either stand or hop into the air the way birds do. In this, in order to take off from the ground, they would HAVE to push up with their wings before actually flying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t they have climbed up high and then simply dropped?&quot; a bat Animalian asked, sounding more curious than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some might have,&quot; Roland answered, &quot;but that wouldn&#39;t apply to all of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie nodded, &quot;and some notable species, such as Quetzalcoatlus and Pteranodon lived in areas that were largely devoid of large cliffs and were too large themselves to climb trees... and various studies have indicated that Quetzalcoatlus COULD achieve some manner of flight and that it wasn&#39;t flightless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still rather awkward when compared to birds,&quot; Locke said smugly.<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland only glared back when the instructor interjected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now,&quot; the flight instructor spoke, &quot;if we were to debate the success of evolutionary practices, we would be in a biology class conducting scientific experiments. But this is PE and we&#39;re here to help you stay fit and in shape. We will start with base warm ups flying around the gym. Five laps. Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet I&#39;ll win!&quot; Locke answered and took too the air.<br />
<br />
A bit irritated at their flight style being called awkward, Sophie and Roland were quick to take after him. In the end, Locke &quot;won&quot; the resulting race, but it was more due to the fact that he&#39;d actually taken off first. Locke remained a bit cocky about it when finished, but as they went through the class, the bat Animalian, who was an uplifted Animal and had only been single dosed during the outbreak seemed more open and curious about things, which seemed to do well. In fact the bat Animalian ultimately caught up Sophie as class ended and they went back toward the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about Locke... he&#39;s... he&#39;s a bit competitive,&quot; the bat Animalian spoke somewhat nervously, &quot;people have called me &quot;Squeak&quot; since I was uplifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He could still to be a bit more polite,&quot; Roland commented. Locke hadn&#39;t been cruel or mean, but it did seem like after something. Roland guessed it might have something to do with how many movie franchises, like Jurassic Park, had made dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals into some sort of super creature that couldn&#39;t be harmed by others. In this there was some rivalry with them since Sophie and Roland were Dinotopians and Locke was an Animalian of a more modern species.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll mature out of it,&quot; Squeak commented, &quot;but what you said on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pterosaurs, speaking generally,&quot; Sophie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;On Pterosaurs was interesting,&quot; Squeak then finished.<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland both smiled at that.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Much of the rest of the day then continued onward with plenty of the same events going on that they&#39;d had through much of the day. Though catching up on what they&#39;d missed because of the storm was something that was expected. Lunch went fine, and both Sophie and Roland were pleased with it, though there were some points where it looked like Jessica wanted to talk about something, but didn&#39;t say anything, making Sophie think it was something private. After all, it wasn&#39;t as though they could just avoid what was missed. Many classes tended to build information learned earlier in the year. Thankfully, the two shared enough classes with the rest of their friends that they figured they could probably catch up in time. However, some things at the end of the day didn&#39;t go quite as well as either would have hoped.<br />
<br />
Their last class of the day was Sexual Education, which was a class that they&#39;d found they shared with Jessica and Roger. Before the mission to officially open Dinotopia Aquatica on Skull Island, the four of them had planned to sit together. Generally from familiarity with each other and the fact that WSA had generally allowed a fair bit of freedom with regard to seating choices. Many seats would often be assigned for attendance purposes and so on, but students could still pick their seats on the first day. However, as they checked in with the teacher and got their materials, they soon found that Jessica and Roger had others at their desk. The only desk that had open seats for them was one in the back where a girl who was a Senior sat alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... Courtney? Can we sit here?&quot; Sophie asked politely as she and Roland moved to the open seats next to the girl, who Sophie thought was named Courtney Hedge.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a free country,&quot; Courtney answered with a shrug and sounded semi-disinterested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Sophie spoke as she sat down and was careful to make sure that her folded wings wouldn&#39;t impact the back of the chair in a way that would damage the wing bones. That wasn&#39;t too hard though, as WSA had to arrange for that to give bird and bat Animalians some comfort, which was something that she and Roland as Pterosaur Animalians would benefit from.<br />
<br />
They sat quietly while the teacher was preparing something to present to the class. After a few moments Courtney whispered something that surprised and shocked both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how does it feel to betray everything you believe in?&quot; Courtney asked in a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Sophie practically hissed back as she looked over to the older student.<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked how does it feel to betray everything you believe in?&quot; Courtney answered, &quot;I overheard you two talking early on last year... talking about integration and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and everything THIS year is more in line with that,&quot; Sophie answered softly, &quot;Humans and Animalians getting along together and working together. Showing that Animalian instincts won&#39;t overwhelm them and that everyone can get along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except you come here as an Animalian, yourself,&quot; Courtney said pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our decision to become Pterodactylus Animalians has nothing to do with what we want for Animalian/Human relations,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;there are many Humans that have become Animalians for various reasons. That has nothing to do with accepting Animalians. Political beliefs and one&#39;s species are not the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Courtney managed a small shrug, &quot;in pure theory, I agree. And in general, if things were functioning normally... I&#39;d have no problem with you deciding to become an Animalian. But... things are NOT normal. The President seems content to try and regulate Horizon and Animalia out of existence as much as he can... and his party has been determined to double down BEFORE he does. The only time when they do seem content to support issues that would welcome Animalia is when they think they can use Animalia as a tool to service their own prejudices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the President&#39;s biases should not be the guiding light in how any individual acts,&quot; Sophie pointed out, &quot;he&#39;d go after Animalia REGARDLESS of whether or not I became an Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Courtney was about to answer when a new voice cut in.<br />
<br />
&quot;While I&#39;m sure this is quite an interesting debate, it is NOT the subject of this class, for two of you, I can offer a warning as it is your first day here,&quot; came the teacher&#39;s voice from practically right in front of them, &quot;but Miss Hedge... as disinterested in this class as you may be, it IS important for your health as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sophie and Roland said weakly to the laughter of many of the others in the class while Courtney just rolled her eyes and let the teacher return to the lesson.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The conversation with Courtney in the last class period was still shocking Sophie couldn&#39;t fully shake it in some ways. It wasn&#39;t as though Courtney was actually against Animalia. In fact, Courtney had often debated the Conservative troll ih8ulibs almost as much as Sophie had, and to some extent fairly successfully. She remained certain in her decision to become an Animalian and eventually convincing her parents to accept that, but that didn&#39;t mean that Courtney&#39;s statements didn&#39;t a point to them...<br />
<br />
Though as the school day ended, that wasn&#39;t the last great surprise that Sophie had for the day. That was when she and the others came out of the WSA building to find Heather quietly waiting on the sidewalk with Jeremy by her side.</p>
