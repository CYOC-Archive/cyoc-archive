<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sixty-six feet clicked on black marble floor, as a figure moved across the great seal in the center of the massive throne room in the damned city in the heart of the 9th circle of hell. The figure on the outside would have been horrifying to any human, his body was massive with a more humanoid upper body while his lower body looked like an armored centipede. Both of his hands appeared human but behind the wrist folded back waiting to snap forward at any moment is a set of scorpion like claws which would replace his normal hand and was powerful enough to crush metal with ease. <br />
<br />
His multiple human like eyes all glowing a sickly green scanned the room, while two free-moving eyes sitting on short eye stocks moved around taking everything it could within 360 degrees. <br />
<br />
“My Lord.” Said a lesser demon in apologize as he almost ran into what was arguably the second most powerful demon in hell before skittering out of the way.<br />
<br />
He was Archduke Beelzebub Carrionfly, Archduke of the Eighth Circle of Hell, Lord of pollution and vermin, Chief of Justice, Grandmaster of the Order of the Fly, Overseer of Gluttony and Idolatry, and Grand Chamberlain to King Lucifer.<br />
<br />
The only demon who was without question greater than him was his best friend and King, Lucifer King of Hell himself. That left possibly the only demon who has more power than him would be Lucifer’s wife Lilith. <br />
<br />
Part of him didn’t like his Queen, because she was formally a human and wasn’t a pure demon. However, none could question the love between Lucifer and Lilith. Overall, he didn’t mind her because the power she wielded in the court was behind the scenes and while she had a voice at the council table she did most of her work behind the scenes. <br />
<br />
The entire palace was in a frenzy as Beelzebub moved toward the grand council chamber, a did pause when he saw multiple generals walking out of the council chamber. His eyes focused on one of them, he was holding a map of Earth with multiple marks on it but he couldn’t see much more than that.<br />
<br />
“Beelzebub.” called Lucifer from within the chambers as he kept moving to find Lucifer standing at the end of a massive black wood table with his Lucifer’s brother and grand admiral of the hellish navy Prince Leviathan and Queen Lilith. His multiple eyes scanned the room, he expected to see Princess Astaroth but she was nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
“My King, what is the situation?” inquired Beelzebub <br />
<br />
“We are mobilizing the army and navy, we need your knights ready to go within seven days.” Announced Lucifer as Beelzebub blinked before he gave a slight smile. <br />
<br />
“Has peace broken down between Heaven and Hell?” inquired Beelzebub, he had been a vocal critic of the peace between heaven and hell and wished constantly that Lucifer would open his eyes and order a surprise attack on Heaven to finally overthrow God. <br />
<br />
“No, the situation is complex but sadly your daughter’s wedding as well as our daughters will be pushed back as well.” Stated Lilith “Our targets are the Iron Knights not Heaven.”<br />
<br />
Beelzebub wasn’t happy to hear that the peace between Heaven and Hell was still on but going after the Iron Knights was a nice side prize. He had called for centuries to strike down these humans, their raids on Hell had never gotten pass the 3rd circle of Hell and the one time they did get into the 3rd circle none of the humans had made it back alive. He hoped that striking down these Iron Knights would kick off a war between Heaven and Hell, he had no proof, but he did believe that Heaven was providing aid to them in some way. <br />
<br />
“The Iron Knights, isn’t Princess Miasma future bride’s father a member of the Iron Knights?” inquired Beelzebub already knowing the answer. He was still upset that Lucifer had allowed his daughter to go to Earth to find a mortal to “love” instead of forcing a union between Miasma and his daughter Cruciata. Miasma hadn’t even just taken a human and forced them to be their slave like Cruciata had done with her new human slave. He wasn’t happy that Cruciata had taken a human but at least that former human seamed to know where place and she was there just to provide pleasure and to sire or birth children nothing more. The human Miasma had brought back seemed to think she was the equal of a pure demon which was unacceptable in his view.<br />
<br />
“He is our prime target.” Confirmed Lucifer “I want the knights ready to go get him, I need him alive.”<br />
<br />
“They are at your command at all time, my King.” Stated Beelzebub “Since you mentioned that your daughters wedding is being delayed, has that the former human has betrayed us or has she been killed by her father? If you wish my daughter would be more then happy to marry Princess Miasma and heal her broken heart.”<br />
<br />
This was the big risk; he had overheard some of his daughter’s plan to contact the Iron Knight to kill the former human and had actually been impressed by his daughter’s plan. He would have been amazed if Cruciata had pulled off her plan so fast but he would have been impressed by it. If everything had gone to his daughter’s plan, the former human bride of Miasma would be dead and an attempt by the Iron Knights on Miasma’s life would get his friend into a rage. That rage would be the only reason why he would go to war with the Iron Knights now, they had been an annoyance for centuries but Lucifer had never wanted to go to war so not to risk war with Heaven.<br />
 <br />
His words didn’t get the response he expected as everyone looked at him with a mixture of distain and hatred. <br />
<br />
“I am going to forget you said those words my old friend. I find my daughter’s choice in mate very acceptable and I am happy to welcome her into the family and court.” stated Lucifer with some anger in his voice but that anger disappeared when he started speaking again. “You haven’t been made aware of the whole situation, so your words are “somewhat” understandable.”<br />
<br />
It clearly wasn’t understandable to either Lilith or Leviathan who gave him a death glare.<br />
<br />
“While on Earth to gather their items Princess Miasma and her future wife Tenebra (Rachel) was finishing up packing when Tenebra’s mother arrived at their door.” explained Lucifer “Tenebra mother is my sister Astaroth former lover who left her to be with Rev. Church out of family pressure.”<br />
<br />
“She has been abused by this man and once she learned that her daughter was getting married it set off Church would proceeded to beat her for years but she has finally worked the courage to leave.” Stated Lilith with venom in her voice, she had a deep hatred of men and women as well who harm their partners. “Astaroth has reextended the marriage proposal she offered decades ago and she has accepted a marriage proposal.”<br />
<br />
Beelzebub’s eyes widened, that would cause a major change politically, with the former human’s mother married to the Archduchess of the 7th circle of Hell Tenebra would be become very powerful person at court and striking at her would not only upset Lucifer but Astaroth as well.<br />
<br />
“This is certain a major change and I am happy that Astaroth has found love but why mobilize the knights?” inquired Beelzebub <br />
<br />
“Tenebra has a brother who unknown to us or him was dating one of Remeila’s little sister.” Explained Lilith “When Rev. Church attacked his wife, he stepped in and took some of the blows and somehow in the event Rev Church struck Remeila’s sister Penemune, Grand Librarian of Heaven and one of Gods favorite daughters.”<br />
<br />
“God is enraged, more so then I have ever seen him outside of our rebellion of course.” explained Lucifer “This is about as enraged as it was when he sent the Flood to destroy the entire Middle East in the past. He is mobilizing his forces as well; we are planning a joint strike against the Iron Knights and Rev. Church most of all. We are going to hit all their chapters at the same time across the entire world, heaven and hell’s armies striking as one fist, it will be unstoppable. That is why we have to delay the traditional weddings for your daughter and mine. For we will be at war with the Iron Knights.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Beelzebub now afraid that his daughter had already reached out to Rev. Church because if she did and the link was discovered it would have been end in horrifying outcomes for her and possibly him as well. Worse case the entire family could be destroyed, to have both Lucifer and God angry at them would be their doom.<br />
<br />
“There is also a chance that Tenebra’s brother could accept Penemune marriage proposal. Remeila believes she will offer her hand.” Added Lilith as she eyed Beelzebub carefully. “This would make another bridge of peace between Heaven and Hell, Tenebra married to our daughter while her brother is married to a daughter of God. Another way to prevent any possible war.”<br />
<br />
“That is good news, you need to knights to gather I will get on that at once.” stated Beelzebub as he bowed and headed out of the room. The situation had changed drastically and not for the improvement of his house.</p>
