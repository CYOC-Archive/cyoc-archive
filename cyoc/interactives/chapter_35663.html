<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I struggled for a bit, then something slipped and I found myself being led to my sisters bedroom.<br />
<br />
We first played &#39;Tea Party&#39; and I got to wear a pink dress that I thought was so nice that I lost myself even further. Afterwards, we played &#39;Princess&#39; were my sister was a queen and I was her loyal daughter. The game off dress-up and pretend continued for most of the afternoon and I only snapped back when I heard mother&#39;s car pulling into the driveway.<br />
<br />
Looking at the pink dress I was wearing, liking the plastic crown in my hair, feeling my mind slip and the memories of always having done this drift in, I recoiled and looked up at my sister and asked her, &quot;Please don&#39;t tell mom about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
My sister looked so cute in her dress that I thought about continuing the game, but then my sister said, &quot;Okay, but you have to promise you&#39;ll play with me some more. Maybe dolls, a game of tea party or we even could play dress-up again. Maybe you&#39;ll even let me do your hair and you can do my hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
I slipped again and hastily said, &quot;Yes. I would like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ducking back into my room, I wondered briefly what I had agreed to, but had no time to think as I quickly changed my clothes and went to find out what was for dinner.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
I awoke the next morning, Sunday, feeling strange. Brushing my soft brown hair away from my eyes, which now ran down just past my shoulders, I looked around my room. It now looked even more like a girls room. I saw that there was now a tall mirror over in the corner, which I thought would be perfect for trying on costumes in front of before fighting off the urges. My dresser was now white with cute pink knobs to open the drawers. My desk now resembled a vanity and I thought about what kind of make-up I could hold in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it,&quot; I mentally told myself as I climbed out of bed and pulled off my Strawberry Shortcake pajamas, which I thought looked cute.<br />
<br />
Without really thinking about it, I went to the closet opened it and tossed my pajamas into a hamper and stopped. Along the wall was a toy box that I realized kept all my favorite toys in it.<br />
<br />
Wanting to open the toy box, I quickly closed the door and moved to my dresser; stopping instead in front of the mirror. Looking at my reflection, I thought nothing of the fact that I now had brown hair down past my shoulders. What caught my attention was the way my body looked. I was smaller and more lithe in appearance. My penis and testicles looked smaller and prepubescent, which was magnified by the fact that I had no pubic hair any where on my body.<br />
<br />
As I stood there looking at myself, wondering what one of Katherine&#39;s dresses would feel like, I heard a door open and close somewhere down the hall and I realized that my mom was up.<br />
<br />
Mentally slapping myself, I went over to the dresser and dressed as fast as I could. I needed to get out of this room and maybe out of the house for awhile. &quot;Maybe being outside will help clear my mind.&quot; I thought.<br />
<br />
My clothes I noticed were about three sizes to big and to keep my pants up, I pulled on a belt that I had not worn in about a year. Walking out of my room, I grabbed breakfast of two blueberry waffles. My mother, I noticed, said nothing about the way I looked, which I found odd.<br />
<br />
Before my mother could talk me into doing something with my sister, who I so wanted to play dress-up and dollies with, I ducked out the back door and headed for my friend&#39;s house. When I got there, I was told that Thomas was visiting his grandparents and would not be back till tonight. Shrugging, I decided to try my other friend&#39;s houses, only to find that they were either busy or their families were not home.<br />
<br />
Wandering a bit, I eventually wound up over by the elementary school. Thinking how great it would to be playing on the swings, I struggled for a bit before my mind slipped again and new memories surged forward; I would spend the rest of the day contently playing there.<br />
<br />
It was only when I noticed that the shadows lengthening that I somehow managed to snap back to my old self, wonder briefly what was wrong with me and why I was behaving the way I was. Shivering, but not because it was cold, I then decided to go home for dinner.<br />
<br />
At home I was immediately greeted by Katherine, who wanted to know if I wanted to play. I simply mumbled, &quot;Maybe after dinner,&quot; feeling my mind slip.<br />
<br />
After dinner, I made an excuse of homework and ducked into my room. A toy table complete with a plastic tea set now sat in the corner. Wanting to play with it, I tried to focus instead on my homework. After a bit, my concentration disappeared completely, my mind regressed and I spent the rest of the evening playing with my dollies and my tea set.<br />
<br />
It was only when I heard, &quot;Marcus, time for bed,&quot; from my mother, that I was jolted back and realized what I was doing.<br />
<br />
I stripped naked and without really paying attention to my actions I then pulled a pair of pink footed pajamas out of the drawer and put them on over my soft naked body; enjoying how soft they felt against my skin. As I snuggled under my bedsheets, I wondered to myself, &quot;What is going on here? I&#39;m a fifteen year old boy, not a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snuggling closer to my favorite stuffed animal, a pink and purple Popple, I drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
I awoke with a start and seeing what I was sleeping next to, my mind jumped back to that of a fifteen year old and I pushed the stuffed animal away. With some difficulty, I slid off the bed, thinking that it was odd, but it seemed bigger.<br />
<br />
Looking first at the bed, now with pink and white sheets which more appropriate for a girl, I then turned to the mirror and saw my reflection cast back. I looked and came to the conclusion that it was not my bed that had grown, but I had shrunk. Taking of my pajamas, my mind slipped and I struggled to pull myself back. Looking back at me from the mirror was a scared nine year old girl. I silently breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that my penis and testicles were still hanging down between my legs and I didn&#39;t have the genitalia of the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
My mind slipped and I folded my hands across my chest, shivering in the early morning air. As I took in the way I now looked, one my hands started to idly fiddle with the soft brown hair that now came midway down my back. Thinking what one of Katherine&#39;s dresses would feel like and how cute I would look in it, I fought off, with some difficulty, this feeling, turned and walked to my dresser.<br />
<br />
Opening the top drawer, I drew back in alarm. Were my normal underwear should be was now a neat pile of rolled up of girls underwear.<br />
<br />
Pulling out a pair that was white with a pink waist band and had a red heart printed on the front with the word &#39;Princess&#39; printed over it, my mind slipped and I suddenly thought, &quot;It&#39;s okay to be wearing these. I am a girl and this is what mommy says little girls wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
This train of thought was broken as I heard my my door opening and my mother asking, &quot;Marcus, are you up yet?&quot; as she walked in.<br />
<br />
As she entered, I used the panties to cover my exposed privates, feeling my mind drift as I felt how soft they were against my skin. Embarrassed that she had caught me undressed and holding a pair of girls underwear, my mother surprised me by not saying a word about the underwear or my appearances, but instead apologized for walking in on me, turned and left, closing the door on her way out.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the dresser, I wondered what I was going to do. Not having any other underwear, I slipped the crotchless panties on and felt my mind continue to drift even farther.<br />
<br />
They were a bit tight in the crotch, but comfortable and I felt like I had been wearing them all my life. Not giving them a second thought, I proceeded to finish getting dressed in a pair of button fly jeans, a tight white T shirt with Strawberry Shortcake on the front and a pair of socks that barely came up to my ankles. The socks, I briefly noted, had a pink bow on the outside of each one.<br />
<br />
After I was dressed, I went out to get breakfast. As I ate, I noticed my sister watching me. This bit of staring continued until finally I asked her, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hair is really pretty. May I do it up in braid for you? Please! Please! Please! I&#39;ve been practicing.&quot; Katherine whined.<br />
<br />
I wanted to say no, but my will failed and my concentration slipped. As I thought about how nice it would be to wear some of her dresses, I found myself saying, &quot;Sure, but after school.&quot;<br />
<br />
After breakfast, I went to grab my shoes and coat and stopped at what I was looking at. My coat was now pink and white with a purple lining and my shoes wear a pair of white girls trainers with pink laces. Realizing that these weren&#39;t the only girls clothing present, I finally realized that the clothes that I was wearing were those normally worn by a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t go to school looking like this!&quot; I thought.<br />
<br />
I was about turn around to go and try to find something more appropriate when my mother rushed into the front hall. Looking at me, she handed me a pink and black backpack and said, &quot;Hurry up or your going to miss the bus.<br />
<br />
Realizing that I had no choice but to go out dressed like this, I put on the trainers and coat. Taking the backpack, I gave my mother a quick kiss goodbye and ducked outside to wait for the bus, which was just pulling up.<br />
<br />
Climbing onto the bus, dreading what people might say, I sat down next to Thomas, who didn&#39;t say a thing about the way I was dressed. He instead started talking about Playstation and baseball. I tried to follow the conversation, but I found my concentration wavering and the feeling of wanting to talk about dresses, dolls, Hello Kitty, Rainbow Bright, Strawberry Shortcake and the show Dragon Tales crept across my mind instead.<br />
<br />
Fighting it, I just barely managed to push all these thoughts back and we reached the Junior High after awhile. Then came the next surprise for me; for no one at school commented on what I was wearing. The fact that I looked about nine escaped everyones attention. Even my teachers acted normal about my appearance.<br />
<br />
Looking at my schedule, I breathed a sigh of relief as I noticed that my gym classes were not until next week. All of a sudden my mind slipped and I though, &quot;Why? I want people to see me in my new My Little Pony one piece swimsuit. I look so cute! Mommy says so!&quot;<br />
<br />
Struggling with these thoughts and how I wanted to show people how cute I looked, Thomas drew me back by telling me, &quot;Hey! Snap out of it already or we&#39;ll be late for class. If that happens, we&#39;ll get detention for sure. What&#39;s wrong with you anyway. You&#39;ve been acting real weird lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, I watched as he walked to class. Struggling with my slipping concentration, I followed him to class. The rest of the day went by in a blur and with only a couple of lapses, I found that it was almost three o&#39;clock. As soon the bell rang, Thomas and I took off. As we rode the bus home Thomas asked, &quot;Think you can come over tonight with your Playstation three?&quot;<br />
<br />
My mind, wandering about, barely noticed what he was saying. I quickly replied, &quot;I&#39;ll ask mom, but I&#39;m sure it will be okay. As long as my homework is done and I.....&quot;<br />
<br />
I stopped in mid-sentence. I had almost told Thomas that I wanted my hair done and was going to play with Katherine.<br />
<br />
Giving me an odd look, Thomas turned toward the window and we rode the rest of the way home in silence. When the bus pulled up in front of my house, I suddenly realized that I painfully needed to drain my bladder. Bidding Thomas a quick goodbye and saying that I&#39;ll try to be over later, I exited the bus in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Walking into the house, I threw down my backpack, hung up my coat and pulled my shoes off. I had only a moment to register that my feet were smaller than before, when the sudden feeling that I was about to lose control of my bladder washed over me. At that point my mind slipped, I grabbed my crotch and hoping that it was enough to keep me from peeing in my pants, I made a run for the bathroom, hearing my mom&#39;s words, &quot;Pee in the toilet not in your pants young lady!&quot; echoing through my head.<br />
<br />
Inside, I quickly pulled down my pants and sat down, just barely making it in time as my bladder emptied into the toilet. As I was standing, bending down slightly to pull up my pants, I then noticed something and my mind jumped back to that of a fifteen year old.<br />
<br />
With my pants still around my ankles, I waddled into my room, almost tripping twice. Kicking of my pants and underwear, I moved hesitantly toward the mirror. Standing in front of it, in nothing but my shirt and socks, the thoughts of wanting to play dress-up in front of it racing through my head, barely seeing the doll house that now sat next to my play tea table, I beheld the sight that was presented before me.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t so much that I now looked about seven, but it was the way my crotch looked that drew my attention. It was now smooth and flat with a thin fold tracing down between my legs; my penis and testicles had completely vanished. Laying down, I spread my legs before the mirror. As I looked at my new genitals, my mind took another twist and I thought out loud, &quot;Mommy says it is not very lady like to be lying like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Closing my legs, I stood and put my &#39;Princess&#39; panties back on followed by my pants. The moment I had my pants back on my fifteen year old self was able to regain control as I realized that the pants I was wearing were now appropriate for a girl of about five or six. The buttons that I had used to keep them closed had vanished and all that remained was smooth denim with two pockets in the front.<br />
<br />
As I was trying to figure out when my pants had changed, my mind shifted and I made a connection that the cracked amulet may have something to do with my change. I as furiously searched my room, my mind made another slip, my concentration faded and I suddenly remembered that the amulet had been thrown out with the trash Friday, which had been picked up this morning. Feeling like crying, I laid down on the bed, inserted my thumb in my mouth and cuddled my dolls and stuffed animals. While I did this, the thought, &quot;The amulet is gone. I&#39;m stuck like this.&quot; raced across my head.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
I must have fallen asleep, because I was gently being shaken awake and my my mom was saying, &quot;Wake up Ashley. Dinners ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
As my mother left and I slid out of bed, I looked into the mirror a saw that I had transformed even more.</p>
