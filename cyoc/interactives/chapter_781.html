<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the tent, men of all ages thronged Stephan with money. It had been made clear that the 
<br>
 bigger the donation, the bigger your likelihood of having your own personal dreams come true. 
<br>
 But there was quite a rush. Stephan explained that due to time constraints, there would only 
<br>
 be one more live demonstration of the Madame's power. All other requests would be handed 
<br>
 the rare opportunity and exquisite responsibility of buying &quot;magical vouchers&quot;. These vouchers 
<br>
 would be specifically geared towards the specific requests of the buyers. Upon conferring with 
<br>
 his mother, Stephan ordered the group to settle down and quiet. Asking them all to stand 
<br>
 calmly, he noticed a young man at the side of the room. He was a large man, and would be 
<br>
 perfect for a good &quot;reduction&quot; show. 
<br>
 &quot;Please my good sir, if you would…&quot; he indicated to the man. The man stepped up. He was in 
<br>
 prime condition. 6'4&quot; of solid muscle. His pecs were rounded muscle, supported by the wide, 
<br>
 white frame of his back. He had a minor goatee, short cropped, but choppy brown hair, and 
<br>
 his T-shirt hugged his huge frame. The man's chin was round and he had a fine beard just 
<br>
 beginning to crop up. Yes, a nice dark layer of narrow felt over the smooth, rugged contours of 
<br>
 his face. The man had muscle practically hanging off him and towered over his host. Stephan 
<br>
 asked for his name. 
<br>
 &quot;My name is Ty&quot; he said. &quot;Can you really do what I think you're gonna?&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Yes, but I believe we'll need a volunteer from the audience…I believe your younger brother 
<br>
 would be a perfect choice?&quot; 
<br>
 Ty started to feel his heart beat very fast. He couldn't believe this was happening. 
<br>
 Ty's little kid brother came up on stage, and said &quot;Are you gonna switch our bodies??&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;No, not your bodies,&quot; said Stephan grinning. &quot;And your name, young sir?&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Jesse!&quot; replied the pip squeaked young boy, who had medium blonde hair, strawberry blonde 
<br>
 actually, and was not cut too short in the back, even from the part on the middle of his head. 
<br>
 Hair that wasn't too smooth or rough, but a nice streaking in between. 
<br>
 &quot;And how old are you?&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Im ten!&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;You are now…&quot; A laugh stirred from the audience. Faces beamed as they watched the new 
<br>
 spectacle unfold. 
<br>
 &quot;Ty, I'd like you to tell me…&quot; said Stephan, &quot;exactly what it is that led you to want to 
<br>
 be…transformed. You seem the picture of health! Why, look at you..tall, muscular. You could 
<br>
 easily intimidate any man. Im sure any gay man in his right mind would practically drool upon 
<br>
 sight of you.&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;It's true…but it's not what I want anymore. I just want someone to take care of me…hug me 
<br>
 and have them be big and powerful. Someone can't do that very much when I'm this tall. And 
<br>
 then there's the muscles… I mean, sure they're great, but I have so many responsibilities. I'm 
<br>
 sick of the upkeep. I'm sure you guys know what I'm talking about… There's always work,&quot; he 
<br>
 said bitterly. &quot;When I was a kid, I never got to play outside. I had to work on the farm. Then 
<br>
 dad died early and with mom already gone I had to raise my bro here and sacrifice a whole 
<br>
 mess of years. Now I'm 26 and miserable. I have two jobs with the one in town and the 
<br>
 farming. All the physical work. I can't stand it anymore! I want to be able to run with a bunch 
<br>
 of other kids and make out with guys that can caress me, and tell me what to do even. I'm 
<br>
 sick of being the boss. I want someone else to take over. I wanna eat cereal in my jammies 
<br>
 and be puny again, dammit!&quot; The audience clapped some. 
<br>
 &quot;Very good, very good…&quot; said Stephan. &quot;And young master Jesse, how do you think you'd 
<br>
 like to be the bigger brother?&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;I'd love it! I hate being a kid! I want to drive! I want to be able to do adult stuff if I want, and 
<br>
 make out with guys…since I'm gay too! And I want people to look up to me,&quot; said the round 
<br>
 headed kid, all 4 feet of him. &quot;I want to be BIG. Like that kid in the movie that wanted to be an 
<br>
 adult. Only I want muscle. Oh man, I want to be an adult right now, SO bad!&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Bad enough to trade about 15 years with your brother?&quot; said Stephan. 
<br>
 Jesse nodded eagerly. 
<br>
 &quot;Then let the games…begin!&quot; 
<br>
 The Madame Illusia stepped out on stage where Jesse and Ty had been gathered. She 
<br>
 looked up into Ty's eyes and made a grasping gesture with her fingers, as gold dust seemed 
<br>
 to magically sprinkle from them. Looking down at Ty, she likewise did the same thing to him. 
<br>
 The boy sneezed. The Madame Illusia nodded in approval. 
<br>
 Ty rubbed his chin. All his facial hair had disappeared! Or no…it hadn't. More like it felt when 
<br>
 he shaved this morning. He smiled his goofy, studly smile. 
<br>
 The Madame Illusia stood back, and waved with her hands at the both of them as they faced 
<br>
 the audience dramatically. 
<br>
 Ty didn't feel himself getting shorter. But, wait! He was a couple inches shorter. His chest 
<br>
 hair, which normally made a fine line down from his belly button up to the middle of his chest, 
<br>
 started to recede. &quot;Oh, man!&quot; he exclaimed, ripping off his shirt, showing the audience. 
<br>
 Jesse felt his underwear tighten. He felt his feet start to itch and pulsate. His shoes were 
<br>
 feeling incredibly uncomfortable. 
<br>
 Ty felt a halting motion, and when he got over feeling momentarily dizzy, he noticed that he 
<br>
 had shrunken about another 6 inches! His pants started to feel loose and were bunching up 
<br>
 around his legs. He had to use both hands to keep them up. He patted his hair. He felt his 
<br>
 face. It felt like the closest shave! Wait…it was scraggly now! Like when he was shaving at 
<br>
 15! He looked over at his &quot;little bro&quot; and noticed he wasn't so little anymore. 
<br>
 Jesse shot up, like a stop motion camera display, only much better. There was nothing ever 
<br>
 captured on film that could compare with this. His shirt bunched up around his chest. His 
<br>
 arms grew outwards, and grew all sorts of hair. He looked across at Ty. They were now 
<br>
 exactly the same height. Then, suddenly, both of them went UNNNNGHH!, and winced in 
<br>
 pain. Jesse, whose face still looked like that of a Childs, grew adult legs, and A CROTCH to 
<br>
 match! He felt his penis snake down and down and all of a sudden hair sprouted all over his 
<br>
 body. 
<br>
 Meanwhile, Ty had started to lose mass. His hair was now all but entirely gone except for a 
<br>
 few little pubes, and his face looked still older than his now lanky, kidlike body. His body 
<br>
 morphed inwards and then looked about 13. 
<br>
 Jesse felt his biceps heaving. He lifted up his still fairly thin arm and watched as muscle was 
<br>
 added to it, bit by bit. He looked at it in fascination. Chin hair sprouted just as his face 
<br>
 morphed and contorted and looked suddenly much, much older. A brief flash encased then 
<br>
 both. Jesse rubbed his eyes and looked down at a slightly familiar looking face. 
<br>
 &quot;TY???&quot; said a booming voice that came from him. His shirt pressed down on his manly pecs. 
<br>
 He tore it off, yanking it over his head and looking at it in disbelief. His body was now more 
<br>
 tan, more perfect. He looked at the mirror. Before him was a practical god of a man, 6'4&quot;, and 
<br>
 a face with a freshly sprouted auburn-golden beard. His chest was covered in lots of scrawny, 
<br>
 curly blonde chest hair. He looked straight out of a body builder magazine!! He lifted up his enormous 
<br>
 arm to check and see if it was really real. His hair looked jagged, and he resembled more 
<br>
 Jake Busey (only with better eyes and looks) than the little pipsqueak who had come in!! 
<br>
 Only he was rugged. And his hair was curlier than before, and ranged from light brown to dark 
<br>
 blond. 
<br>
 Oh, man. He licked his lips over his new powerful body. He could do anything he wanted 
<br>
 now…he was a REAL man. No one would ever shove HIM around again. 
<br>
 Ty looked wondrously over his arms. No hair. He looked up at his brother, his new protector. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Thanks, Jesse…&quot; he said warmly. 
<br>
 &quot;Don't thank me, bro,&quot; Jesse said, feeling his bicep in almost orgasmic disbelief. &quot;I just can't 
<br>
 believe it's finally come true. Man, I am the MAN…&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;You sure are! Can you carry me back to the car?&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Hey, I can drive home! Uh..I guess you'll have to teach me how to do that…&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it in no time. There are a lot of things that are all yours 
<br>
 now…Oh man, I can go back to school! I can ace my classes and spend all my time playing! 
<br>
 Yeah!&quot; he said as they &quot;high&quot; fived. Actually Jesse reached down for that. he put on Ty's old 
<br>
 jeans, which barely fit his own now hulking thighs. Ty likewise put on Jesse's old flannel 
<br>
 shorts. 
<br>
 &quot;Man, I can't believe it. I'm a kid again.&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;I won't let you down. I'll get a job and support us…&quot; said Jesse proudly. 
<br>
 &quot;And you can have it…&quot; beamed Ty. &quot;Hey, can I have cotton candy??&quot; 
<br>
 &quot;Sure. Why are you asking me?&quot; shrugged Jesse. 
<br>
 &quot;Cause you got my wallet…&quot; said Ty, laughing. Now he was just a little boy, after all. Dark 
<br>
 haired. A ten year old again. This was going to be fun. 
<br>
 &quot;Awesome!&quot; said Jesse, looking through the wallet, still shirtless and towering over Ty. Then, 
<br>
 in a wonderful gesture of brotherly love, Jesse scooped Ty up in his arms and let the now 
<br>
 young tyke ride on his massive, tightly strung shoulders. The veins in Jesse's arms shone 
<br>
 with sweat underneath the lamplight. 
<br>
 &quot;Thank you for everything…&quot; said Jesse vehemently, with Ty waving on top as they left the 
<br>
 tent. 
<br>
 &quot;Bye bye!&quot; said Ty. 
<br>
 &quot;Another satisfied customer…&quot; said Stephan fingering the stack of twenties left behind. &quot;Now 
<br>
 I'd like to reiterate…we do take Visa, and American express…&quot; 
<br>
 * * * 
<br>
 In the parking lot, Jesse dug through the car for a shirt he could put on. At first he thought, 
<br>
 &quot;nah, that would never fit me. Then, smiling, he remembered. He put it on gleefully. He 
<br>
 jumped up and down childishly. &quot;Im an a-du-ult. I can do-oo ad-ult stuff…Whoo!&quot; he said, 
<br>
 throwing his fist in the air and jumping, then getting back up and running away from the car as 
<br>
 fast as he could, and jumping into the air. &quot;I feel so huge!&quot; 
<br>
 Ty, as a little boy, contemplated what life would be like. How would it be having a ten year old 
<br>
 telling you what to do all the time? He didn't care, though. He could now be free of having 
<br>
 anything really hard to do… 
<br>
 Jesse came back, smiling as ever. His hair was short but it showed his face off all the more, 
<br>
 his stout chin, which was rounded and stunning, and his perfect eyes. And the new little 
<br>
 crags in his face that made him radiate sexuality. Before they had left the fair, he went to a 
<br>
 barber's stall and got his very first shave. It had felt so good! The warm metal scraaaaaping 
<br>
 his face had just been the best. He had to keep from smiling lest he get cut! 
<br>
 &quot;Okay, bro…show me how I can drive us home!&quot; 
<br>
 It wasn't easy. In fact it took all night just to show him all the maneuvers. Jesse listened 
<br>
 attentively as Ty instructed him bit by bit. He learned reverse, etc, and finally Ty thought they 
<br>
 were ready to leave. By that time it was very late at night. Ty was really getting tired! It was 
<br>
 only one AM, though! Geez, he thought. I hadn't anticipated this side effect. He yawned a 
<br>
 sleepy child's yawn. 
<br>
 Meanwhile, Jesse was getting the thrill of his life. He was still finding it difficult and was 
<br>
 halting a lot more than Ty ever did…(and he meant ever!) and a few times he cursed. Wow! 
<br>
 Even cursing sounded manly coming from him… Just wait until he got a beefy little man in his 
<br>
 room. He'd fuck guys like there was no tomorrow. And they'd all be grateful, because his 
<br>
 body was so HUUUGE! He smiled and drove in the night, speeding a LOT but luckily there 
<br>
 weren't that many people on the highway. By the time he made it back to the farm, he was 
<br>
 rushing very quickly along. Things started getting really bumpy, so he tried to slow down, but 
<br>
 unfortunately did it too quickly. He halted right before he nearly hit a side of the barn right 
<br>
 near the house. 
<br>
 He smiled at his new &quot;kid&quot;. Man, did this mean he was a parent now??? Cool! 
<br>
 He went to the other side of the car and got Ty out, cradling him in his arms. Ty was sleepy, 
<br>
 but wake enough to know who held him. &quot;thanks…&quot; he murmuired. 
<br>
 The biggest thrill came when Jake was inside, and carried Ty to HIS room. He'd like it here, 
<br>
 at least until they figured a few things out…(like who would order who around?) Well, he 
<br>
 thought. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to. Heh heh. He WAS in charge now. And tbey 
<br>
 were gonna do things HIS way ALL the time. After puttiing Ty to bed, Jesse went to the 
<br>
 bathroom…he needed to pee! He emptied his…gigantic! penis's contents into the bowl. That 
<br>
 sucker had to be 8 inches long! Wow!!! He felt so proud. And boy did it take a long time to 
<br>
 piss! He'd really filled up at the fair. Then another thought crossed his mind. I can 
<br>
 masturbate… he thought. Waiting until he was sure he was done with the peeing, he started 
<br>
 to massage the penis, like he'd heard his friends described to him. God, that thing just shot 
<br>
 up! Full attention! Like a soldier, man. He thought of all the sweaty muscular guys he'd seen 
<br>
 in his life…wearing construction gear or sweating in a sports match. Sweat glistening from 
<br>
 their bodies. He was ONE of them now! He stroked harder and harder. Cum flew all over the 
<br>
 seat and the bowl! It just kept coming and coming…the cum managed a way all around his 
<br>
 fingers but he didn't care. It felt so warm and good! After cleaning up he was ecstatic…who 
<br>
 could sleep!?? He ran to where his brother's bodybuilder mags were, and in his NEW room for 
<br>
 the night, sat down on the different feeling bed. (for one it was neater…much more adult than 
<br>
 the little kiddy bed he'd had) Turning on the lamps he looked at all sorts of studs. He 
<br>
 masturbated about three or four more times before deliriously falling asleep.</p>
