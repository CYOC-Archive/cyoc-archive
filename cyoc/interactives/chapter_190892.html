<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dillon was relieved to see that his experience yesterday wasn&#39;t just a weird fever dream (of course it was still weird). He still had a ridiculous muscular build, and two large reptilian tails happily swishing behind him when he looked at them. Dillon let out a yawn before checking the clock. &quot;7:00. I got an hour before I work.&quot; Dillon remembered he has a morning shift at the cafe. &quot;Guess I should go shower.&quot; Dillon peaked outside to see Jacob still asleep cuddling with one of the pillows on his couch. Giggling a bit, he snuck through the living room to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Once he was inside, Dillon noticed he can barely fit due to his stature. Knowing he&#39;d could just change the size of the room, he figured to upgrade a few aspects as well. &quot;My bathroom will get two times bigger, and my bath will turn into a walk-in shower with a glass sliding door.&quot; The ring reacted and his bathroom walls started to move outward while moving the vanity, toilet, and bath. It wasn&#39;t too long before the bath started to sink into the ground as the tub faucet did the same through the wall. A metal door frame with glass forming around it. The glass separated in two layers and a handle appears on the left completing his new walk-in shower. &quot;Wow! I felt like I just set off a temple trap right there.&quot; Dillon laughed testing out his sliding door. &quot;Nice. Let&#39;s give this new body a good soaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
After striping naked, Dillon took a look at his body through the glass and took a good look at his body and blushed at his slight stiffy. The thought of his head on top of all that brawn got his imagination running wild with pleasaurly thoughts. Turning on the hot water and stepping in, he felt it flow down his body with pure ecstacy. Steamy hot water flowed down his two tails causing them to shiver at the sensitive feeling. Dillon wanted more body. More to feel the sweet sensation. &quot;I will grow another pair of pecs and arms with the same an of muscle...&quot; Dillon could hardly concentrate in the satisfaction but he managed to make the ring act. Dillon could feel his upper chest growing as two nipples formed right above his original and his massive pecs split from two to four. He felt two nubs forming from his shoulders as they started rapidly expanding outward. The nubs swollen with muscle creating additional joints for Dillon to control. Dillon placed his hands on his chest as his cock started getting erect from the sher development of his new arms. His hand palms and fingers formed at the tip of his new arms with the hot water flowing down his body causing him to moan. &quot;Holy shit yes!&quot; His two tails flailed around splashing the puddle below him while his cock became fully erect and spewed cum all over the tiled wall. Dillon now had two sets of muscular arms, the top flexing from their satisfying growth, and the bottom original which were rubbing his hard member. &quot;At least I&#39;m in the shower...&quot; Dillon blushed.<br />
<br />
One incredibly horny shower later, Dillon dried himself off and wrapped a towel around his waist. He opened the door to the living room to see Jacob fiddling with the remote with his giant hands. &quot;Jacob?&quot; Jacob heard Dillon call his name in surprise causing him to rocket the remote in the air. It fell to the floor with the batteries flying out. &quot;Are you gonna be okay when I&#39;m gone?&quot; Dillon laughed. &quot;Shut up. Ook! Not that I&#39;m complaining, but it&#39;s not easy working these big hairy hands.&quot; Jacob picked the remote and batteries and reconnected them. He looked behind to see Dillon&#39;s recent addition which almost surprised him. &quot;Oh. New arms? Eek! Is that why you were yelling in the bathroom?&quot; Jacob asked his monkey tail swishing behind him. &quot;Shut up...&quot; Dillon retorted. &quot;Oh that reminds me...&quot; Dillon stared into his ring. &quot;Everyone will be oblivious to any changes I make to myself or them unless I will it. Jacob will be the only exception.&quot; The ring glowed insuring Dillon&#39;s command was accounted for. &quot;There, now nobody will be any the wiser. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh! By the way, what do you mean by when you&#39;re gone? Ahh! Where ya going exactly?&quot; Jacob asked picking up the remote with his tail and jumping over the couch. &quot;Work. I know it seems redundant, but I think I&#39;d rather keep attached to my normal life before I do anything drastic. Just for now anyway.&quot; Dillon explained. &quot;Drastic? You told me you were the one who gave tails to everyone in the world. Is that not drastic? Eek!&quot; Jacob mocked. &quot;Whatever you say. I gotta get dressed.&quot; Dillon patted Jacob&#39;s head with his new arms and went to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Once again, the ring accounted one of Dillon&#39;s previous wishes which allowed his clothes to adapt to his current form, hence why his work uniform and all other clothes now had an addition of four arm sleeves. Of course getting dressed without getting tangled was another story. Dillon emerged from his bedroom in his uniform. &quot;Right. Don&#39;t wreck the place while I&#39;m gone.&quot; He said petting Jacob&#39;s head again. Jacob made the same monkey noises as usual as Dillon used all four of his arms to pet multiple areas. &quot;OOH OHH AHH! Stop please! Haha! AAH!&quot; Dillon obliged and left a huffing gorilla man behind him.<br />
<br />
The walk to the cafe was tame for the most part besides everyone walking around with a tail behind them. Dillon had so desperately wanted to change everyone he passed into some insane creature. But he decided to hold back until his shift was over. But it didn&#39;t stop him from grasping how weird it was to be the only freak show walking around and everyone thinking it normal. &#39;This is amazing. I&#39;m a goddamn behemoth and nobody cares.&#39; He thought to himself as he approach a building with a sign that read &quot;Cafe&quot;. He entered to see the place halfway full of people as he walked behind the desk to clock in for his shift. &quot;Hey Dillon.&quot; A girl with dark brown hair in a ponytail approached Dillon. &quot;Hey Jasmine. Your looking well.&quot; Dillon replied. &quot;You too. How&#39;s Jacob doing by the way? He&#39;s not shedding everywhere still hasn&#39;t he?&quot; Jasmine asked. Dillon was put off at how Jasmine knew Jacob was his pet. &quot;Uh... I haven&#39;t... Really noticed.&quot; He replied. &quot;Alright. I gotta get some orders ready for next week. You go ahead and watch counter for me.&quot; Dillon nodded. “Just don&#39;t short the order on bagels this time.&quot; He reminded her. &quot;Yeah, don&#39;t worry. I took a much needed mental note. I have the memory of an elephant ya know.&quot; Dillon laughed as Jasmine walked away. To his surprise, Jasmine actually did have a long grey leathery tail with a tassel swishing behind her. &#39;Yeah. And the tail of one too.&#39; He thought chuckling a bit. <br />
<br />
With all the customers already helped, Dillon was ready to put the ring&#39;s power into action. He looked around and wondered if he should start with some customers, or his co-workers.</p>
