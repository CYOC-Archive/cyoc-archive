<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milton laid there in bed, relaxing, and thinking about what happened back at the hotel with Tim.  That kiss...that kiss was one of the most wonderful things that he had ever felt.  He felt loved and wanted, but not in the way his parents did, it was on a different level.  He felt safe, like no one in the world could hurt him in any way; no snide comments, no bullying, no taunting, no bad things that had happened to him in the past could hurt him as long as he was in Tim's strong arms. <br />
 <br />
He thought Tim was beautiful.  The massive muscles with veins and striations running through them might have intimidated him, but one look into his soft eyes, and Milton knew he had nothing to fear.  Tim looked just like he had in the dream Milton had the previous night, but in the flesh, and much better.  The feeling of huge pecs and bulging biceps, holding him close as Tim kissed him, was overwhelming.  He knew he wanted to see him again, hopefully to relive the experience. <br />
 <br />
Milton got up, walked over to the mirror again, and looked at himself.  &quot;What does Tim see that I don't?&quot;  he wondered.  He thought he was nothing special.  He looked like he worked out, but a lot of guys worked out.  Flexing in the mirror, he felt that he had to find out more...more about his body, about himself.  A chill ran up Milton's spine, and he realized he had better put a shirt on before he gets too cold.  He went to his drawer, grabbed the first shirt he could find, and attempted to put it on.  It was quite a struggle to get it on, as he had some problems getting his arms through the holes.  When he finally got it on, he looked at himself in the mirror.  The shirt was painted onto him, it was so skin tight.  His arms bulged out of the sleeves, his back was stretching paper thin, his chest was pushing out from his body, and causing the shirt to rise above his waist, showing off his washboard abs.  He was very uncomfortable, but didn't want to try to take it off.  &quot;Oh great, now what am I going to do? rip out of this shirt?&quot;  Milton asked himself, but then the idea struck him.  He began to do some of the poses he had done earlier.  He flexed his chest as hard as he could, and he felt the fibers of the t-shirt stretch and start to give way to the muscle that was pressing against them.  The holes in the chest area started to widen deeper and deeper as the shirt continued to rip from his body.  After a few seconds, the front was ripped open, save for a small section around his abs.  Satisfied with this, he raised his arms in a double biceps, watching as the peaks rose up and started to tear the fabric in a delicious ripping sound.  &quot;There, much better!&quot;. <br />
 <br />
Milton walked away from the mirror, then suddenly stopped and looked down at himself.  His shirt was ripped, his muscles were pulsing with blood, and he was amazed that he had done that.  This was far too weird for him.  He also started missing Tim a lot more than he had before, so he ran to the phone book and looked up the hotel's number, dialed it, and managed to get Tim's room. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; <br />
&quot;Tim, it's me, Milton, I mean Josh&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey buddy, I just got in the door.  Couldn't stop thinking about you all night&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, I've been thinking about you all night as well.  Listen, something weird just happened to me just now, and it's got me kinda freaking out&quot; <br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; <br />
&quot;It's hard to explain, I don't know what came over me&quot; <br />
&quot;Josh...Can I come over?&quot; <br />
&quot;Of course you can&quot; <br />
&quot;Good, give me some directions, and I'll be there as soon as I can&quot; <br />
 <br />
Milton gave Tim some quick directions, and got off the phone.  He waited patiently by the door in the living room, and about ten minutes later, he heard a car come into the driveway.  He looked out the window and saw a rental car in the driveway.  The doorbell rang, and he went to answer it.  Standing in the doorway was Tim, dressed in a long sleeve shirt, tie, and dress pants.  Milton invited him in, and the two of them started kissing right away. <br />
 <br />
&quot;I missed you so much&quot; <br />
&quot;I missed you too&quot; <br />
&quot;You look so handsome in those clothes&quot; <br />
&quot;Thanks! You...you...what happened to your shirt?&quot; <br />
&quot;That's the weird thing I was telling you on the phone&quot; <br />
&quot;I see, want to talk about it?&quot; <br />
&quot;I think I need to, let's go sit down&quot; <br />
 <br />
Tim loosened his tie, undid the first few buttons on his shirt, showing the deep chasm between his plates of muscle, and joined Milton on the couch. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Ok, so what happened?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, I was standing in front of the mirror, looking at myself, thinking I was nothing special, and I got a chill so I put on a shirt.  It was way too small on me, I was really uncomfortable in it, but I didn't want to take it off again.  For some reason, I got this idea in my head to flex my muscles in order to get out of it, and you see what happened&quot; <br />
&quot;Josh, listen to me, you're more than 'nothing special'.  You have a body that most guys 5, 10, ore more years older than you would kill for.  You are a very special person, in both your body, and to me.  I think what happened was that you caught a glimpse of how powerful your body is.  You are starting to turn into Josh.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Tim leaned in and started kissing Milton again.  Milton reciprocated and started to unbutton Tim's shirt as they were making out.  He felt the rock hard muscle of Tim's chest, biceps, back, and stomach.  Milton felt a certain thrill in this and was amazed at the power and hardness of this muscle.  He felt a bit of it back at the hotel, but now he got a chance to explore it more. <br />
 <br />
&quot;You feel this muscle?  This is what can be yours, and probably even bigger than mine.  You are that special, and I want to help you achieve it.  I want Josh, not Milton, and I know you want it to, even though you won't admit it.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Tim was right, he did want it, he wanted to be someone else.  For pretty much all of his life, he was a skinny nerd, who was not interested in sports, had no friends or social life, and especially no one to love him.  He wanted something different, and he needed to realize that with Ty's gift, he could be something much more than he had been.  He was willing to let Tim help him become the man he could be.  Milton looked up into Tim's soft eyes and slowly nodded a yes. <br />
 <br />
&quot;I've had a long day, I'm tired.  Can I crash her for the night?&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;Not a problem&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;Would you like to join me?&quot; <br />
 <br />
Milton almost jumped at the chance.  He led Tim to the master bedroom, and Tim began undressing both himself and Milton.  When he was done, he scooped MIlton up in his arms, gave him a big kiss and brought him to bed with him.  As both of them laid down on the bed, they cuddled together and kissed. <br />
 <br />
&quot;We'll talk more about it in the morning, ok Josh?&quot; <br />
 <br />
All Milton could do was dreamily nod his head yes. <br />
 <br />
Both of them quickly fell asleep</p>
