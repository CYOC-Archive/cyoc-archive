<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You consider what they've told you, and you realize there's a reason they're being so honest. It's because they hold all the cards. They have no reason to lie; they could kill the two of you where you stand, or cast you out to their &quot;children&quot;, as they call them.<br />
You just hope they weren't exaggerating on the free will part of the bargain. Perhaps, just perhaps, you and Becky could figure out some way to stop them, once you've harnessed the abilities of the werewolf for yourself.<br />
<br />
          &quot;Alright,&quot; you reply sadly, &quot;You win. So, how does this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
          &quot;Don't sound so dejected,&quot; the man replies tenderly, &quot;You act like it's the end of the world, when really, it's the beginning of a new one.&quot;<br />
          <br />
           &quot;That's easy for you to say,&quot; you mutter, &quot;Noone told you to become a werewolf or die.&quot;<br />
<br />
           &quot;On the contrary,&quot; the woman said, smiling broadly, her eyes glittering, &quot;I did.&quot; She made an elegant twirling motion, and her dress fell to the floor, leaving her completely naked. &quot;He didn't hesitate half as long as you girls have.&quot;<br />
<br />
          You're acutely aware of a definite odor in the air. It's not unpleasant, but it's noticeable, and you're not sure, but you think it's making you a little horny. You suppose it's for the best, really. It'll make what has to happen much easier for the two of you.<br />
<br />
          &quot;Wow,&quot; Becky said, admiring the woman's firm and full breasts and trim body, &quot;You're..you're gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
          &quot;Thank you,&quot; the woman replied, &quot;I'm not QUITE as beautiful as when I first became a werewolf, but that was nearly a hundred years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
          &quot;Those boobs are so good, they almost look fake!&quot; Becky said, unable to take her eyes off of the woman, seemingly entranced. Admittedly, you're having a hard time as well. She's every bit as gorgeous as Becky's gushing would imply.<br />
<br />
           &quot;Go ahead and feel them,&quot; the woman said with a devilish smile, &quot;I don't mind.&quot; Becky got up off her stool, slowly reaching out to experimentally feel the woman's offered breasts. The woman guided Becky's touch, first making her cup them, then massage them more firmly. The man comes up behind you, lifting you up slightly, pulling you off the stool. You're acutely aware of his breath on your neck as he presses into you, the fabric of his jeans brushing against your ass, and you realize exactly HOW this is going to all happen.<br />
<br />
             &quot;Holy Shit!&quot; Becky yelps, pulling her hand away suddenly. The sudden yelp stops everything. You pull away from the man, the woman backs away from Becky. <br />
<br />
              &quot;What?&quot; you ask Becky, &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
      <br />
            &quot;That...that felt so weird,&quot; Becky said, pointing to the woman's chest, where brown hairs had begun to sprout. &quot;It tickled a bit and startled me. Sorry,&quot; she said to the woman.<br />
<br />
             &quot;It's fine, dearie,&quot; the woman replied, smiling broadly. &quot;Of course, to make it up to me, I'd ask that you give me a kiss.&quot;<br />
Becky eagerly smiled, planting a wet kiss on the woman, groping her firmly. Your male companion growls in your ear, and you can feel him trembling. He slides a hand up your skirt, tugging at your panties. You pull away from him, bumping into Becky and the woman, who both look a little bothered at your interruption.<br />
<br />
             &quot;Marcus!&quot; the woman snaps at the man, &quot;You need to have SOME form of restraint!&quot; <br />
<br />
             &quot;I..I...&quot; he grunts, his voice gravelly and low. &quot;I..I know, Arianna, but..you know how I get.&quot; You glance behind you, looking at him. His shirt is straining at the seams, and he's clearly gained considerable muscle mass. His arms are hairier than you remember, and his eyes are reflecting yellow in the dim light of the bar. He also smells REALLY good. Far better than you remember him smelling. You bury your face into his chest, inhaling heavily. Somewhere in your brain, you know this is the last thing you should logically be doing, but you push that away. That's why the pheremones are there, you reason, to make a hard decision a whole lot easier.<br />
You inhale again, letting his scent wash away your reason. Being logical Jen isn't going to help you here anyway. You inhale again, letting yourself become the impulse driven creature you've always been afraid to be, and you peel your clothes off slowly for him.<br />
<br />
              Becky is similarly entranced now by the woman, dropping to her knees at the gentle push of Arianna's hand.   &quot;Jen,&quot; she says, why don't you come over here beside Becky?&quot; she says, and you comply, Marcus trailing behind you quickly, and you hear his clothing fall to the floor. Becky similarly is disrobing before rejoining you at the feet of the woman.<br />
<br />
            &quot;Are you ready, girls?&quot; she asks. You both nod, staring at the woman, waiting. You know what's going to happen, and now you WANT it. For a moment nothing happens, and then a powerful odor begins to waft to your noses. You stare entranced at her shaven mound as it begins to twitch, quivering and blossoming fur, dripping fluid.<br />
You both move to taste it, but Becky's quicker, blocking you out as she buries her face in it, wrapping her arms around the woman's legs.<br />
<br />
            You turn to the man, whose body has begun to quake, smiling at him. You grab his erect cock, tasting the precum. It tastes better than anything you've ever had in your mouth, let alone semen and you want more. &quot;Change! Change for me!&quot; you say, going back to bobbing up and down on his cock, feeling it changing shape inside your mouth.<br />
<br />
           The bar is filled by inhuman howls and growls, the sound of flesh reshaping, and of pleasure as you and Becky eagerly and enthusiastically perform the best oral sex either of you have ever administered. Even once you've had your fill of your partners, you swap, each of you now taking the other, fully wolfen alpha, until you've both gulped down as much of the fluids as you could possibly stomach.</p>
