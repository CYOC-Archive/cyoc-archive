<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lynn came back into the living room, looking uncomfortable. “Sorry..” she said, sounding a little shaky. Her eyes darted to my crotch, and she immediately turned her head toward her sister. Oh yes, she was feeling the temptation, trying to avoid looking at me..and more specifically, at my vulva.<br />
<br />
Lacey looked at her sister, arching an eyebrow. “Everything okay?” Her eyes darted to me, and I got another quick smile from her. Lynn nodded, but didn&#39;t say anything. Lacey refocused on me. “If you want us..with you..” she said, giving emphasis to the last two words, discreetly informing me that she understood what being “with me” entailed, “you probably need to understand what it was like for us, when we were younger.”<br />
<br />
“Go on,” I said. I wasn&#39;t entirely sure where she was going with this, but I was intrigued. Her body language and slight change in her tone of voice had become slightly more seductive and sexual. <br />
<br />
“Mom had us when she was young..and our dad wasn&#39;t around. The guy she&#39;s married to isn&#39;t our father, at least not biologically. Even after she met him and they got married..we grew up poor.”<br />
I nodded. I understood that. My own parents hadn&#39;t been wealthy, though we were middle class. That being said, I remembered how it felt when I&#39;d met kids who&#39;d grown up in much more advantageous circumstances.<br />
<br />
“You need to understand, growing up with a twin is..it&#39;s different. There&#39;s nothing like it. You want your own identity, and it can be hard, when someone else has your face and your body. But at the same time..you have this connection, one that&#39;s MORE than anything you feel with anyone else. You almost..you almost share an identity. And it feels..it feels right, and it feels secure,” Lacey told me.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d imagine so. It must have been nice. I was an only child..so I didn&#39;t really have that closeness with anyone, beyond my folks,” I replied. It still felt weird. I was a goddess now. I remembered wishing my parents to stay away until I wanted them to return, back when I had first gotten the ring and been with Alicia. Where were they now? Did it matter? I didn&#39;t..I didn&#39;t need them. I was divine. But still...I pushed the thought aside. I&#39;d deal with that at some point. I had something much more important to do..and company that was MUCH more intriguing.<br />
<br />
“Our bedroom was tiny,” Lacey said. “Remember that, Lynn? That bedroom we had that was so small, that it would almost be illegal to advertise it as a full bedroom?”<br />
<br />
Lynn smiled, strangely enough. “Yeah..so small that it couldn&#39;t fit two beds. I mean..assuming mom could have afforded two beds.” Lynn glanced at me for a half second. “Two kids sharing a double bed. I&#39;m pretty sure it only worked because we were twins.” Her eyes glanced down at my crotch again; I discreetly hiked the dress up just enough to give her a glimpse. Immediately, she forced herself to make eye contact, but again, her gaze dropped. Then back up to eye contact.<br />
<br />
Lacey smiled. “Two girls, both of whom hit their sexual awakening at the same time. I think our mom probably didn&#39;t realize that.” Lynn looked mortified as Lacey added, “We compared notes a LOT about what felt good.”<br />
<br />
“Jesus, Lace..you don&#39;t need to tell her that!” she said, staring daggers at her sister.<br />
<br />
Lacey only smiled. “It&#39;s not like I&#39;m telling her about us waking up groping each other. Or the times we&#39;d end up half-scissored.”<br />
<br />
“LACEY!” Lynn snapped.  “YOU ARE SERIOUSLY GOING WAAAY TOO FAR HERE!”<br />
I could only smile. I was getting more and more aroused by the moment. I let the dress ride a bit further up, spreading my legs a bit more. “Seriously,” Lynn said, looking at me, “Just ignore h-”  her eyes settled on my bared crotch, and she stopped speaking. She let out a soft moan. “Stop..stop it..” she said weakly. “You know what..what you&#39;re doing..”<br />
<br />
Lacey had an ear to ear grin on her face as she stared with undisguised lust at me. She scooted next to her twin. “What&#39;s the matter, sis?” she cooed seductively. “Having trouble denying that you&#39;re into girls?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m..I&#39;m not into girls..” Lynn protested.<br />
<br />
“She says she&#39;s not, but..” Lacey teased, “We used to masturbate next to each other in bed. And..then it moved to making out with each other while we did it. And then..she suggested we help each other out..” <br />
<br />
Lynn was staring at my crotch, completely entranced. “That was..that was different. We&#39;re twins..basically one person, two bodies..” she looked at Lacey with wide eyes, full of tempted uncertainty. “Touching you is like touching me..and you touching me is..like me doing it myself.”<br />
<br />
I began to ease the straps down my shoulders, letting the dress fall. I pushed it down my legs and off. I sat there naked in the chair; you could cut the sexual tension in the room with a knife.  Lynn noticed and let out an audible gasp, then haltingly lifted her shirt, revealing a flat stomach and gorgeous tits encased in a lacy black bra. “I...god..I..” she looked at Lacey with a mildly panicked expression. “Lacey...I..I want..” <br />
<br />
“I know. We want the same thing. One mind, two bodies..” Lacey replied, reaching under her own crop top and with a tug, unhooking her bra. She smiled at me as she slowly peeled her top up until her heavy breasts fell down,  proving that it hadn&#39;t been the bra – she had a pair of exceedingly perky double d&#39;s that seemed a half-cup larger than her more restrained sister&#39;s.  She glanced over to me with a heavy-lidded gaze, fully aroused and enraptured by both myself and her sister.  She slipped off of the couch with a smile and kicked her shoes off and wriggled out of her shorts. Her perfect bottom was encased in a pair of black boy shorts, and she smiled again as she eased them off, revealing a tiny, tucked-away pussy. Slowly, Lacey began to untie and unlace Lynn&#39;s shoes. She looked over at me. <br />
<br />
“We have two separate beds, but we still share a room. We actually had separate bedrooms for about a month in our new house, but it felt too weird. Lonely. So now the second room&#39;s my office, for when I do remote Geek Squad shit. And some nights..we still share a bed,” Lacey said as she tossed the shoes aside. She tugged Lynn&#39;s socks off, then licked the top of one foot, making her reluctant sister moan loudly.<br />
<br />
“Fuck..fuck..Lace..I..god..I&#39;m wet..I&#39;m so fuckin&#39; wet..” she whined. Her eyes were almost glassy with lust. “Fuck..fuuuuckkk...” she moaned as she grabbed the front clasp of her bra and yanked it hard, struggling to undo the catch until it finally popped. Her chest was, as I&#39;d estimated, about a half-cup smaller, but her tits were as firm and perfect as Lacey&#39;s. Both nipples sported barbells, and she immediately cranked them hard and let out a louder moan. “Please Lace..please..please..Lace..fuck..Lace..”<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Lacey looked back at her sister, then moved her hands to Lynn&#39;s waist and undid her jeans and slowly pulled them down and casually tossed them aside. Lynn&#39;s legs twitched as Lacey slowly licked from her ankle to her inner thigh, first on the left leg, and then on the right. Lynn  cranked her barbells and arched, thrusting her crotch toward Lacey&#39;s face, while Lacey continued to tease her. “FUUUUCK.LACE..PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE!” Her black lace panties glistened with wetness.<br />
<br />
I got up out of the chair and joined Lynn on the couch. I was as aroused as she was; my whole body was aching for the release that she was screaming for. I was insanely turned on by these two gorgeous women, bound by the bond of twinship, bound by a lifetime of sexual discovery with each other. It was time to enhance that further and bond them to each other via the wolf, and to me. Lacey had been the one to share so much with Lynn. Now it was Lynn&#39;s turn to share something with her. I&#39;d made a wish to be able to turn someone with even just a kiss earlier; I knew it would work.<br />
<br />
As I sat down, I saw Lacey&#39;s attention turn toward me, and one hand stroked my leg. My pussy ached for release, but it could wait for just a short while longer. I shook my head with a smile, and Lacey took the hint without much prompting, her truest desire still her sister. Lynn craned her neck toward me, her eyes wide and desperate, full of lust and abandon. “Here,” I said softly. “Let me free you.” My tongue invaded her mouth, and she pushed into the kiss as I willed the gift of lycanthropy into her.<br />
<br />
Lacey reached up and pulled Lynn&#39;s soaking panties down, burying her face in between her sister&#39;s thighs. As we broke the kiss, I saw the gift take hold. Lynn&#39;s eyes yellowed and as her mouth opened in a  moan of pure ecstasy, her teeth were already lengthening into fangs. She reached down and grabbed the back of her sister&#39;s head, no longer content to be passive as the carnal truth of the wolf raced through her mind. She no longer had to be confused or ashamed of what she was or what she wanted, and now she TOOK what she wanted from her sister, who eagerly complied with the face fucking Lynn was giving her. <br />
<br />
As Lacey tasted the emerging wolf in Lynn, the condition passed to her. I saw wisps of the sandy blonde fur rippling on her arms as her whole body began to shake. Lynn snarled at me, snapping her jaws in the air. “You too! Touch me as we change!” she demanded with a voice that was deeper, echoing with the power of the beast. I lowered my head to her swelling breast and sucked hard on a nipple, delighting as I heard her let out another growling moan of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Lacey came up for air, her face covered in her sister&#39;s juices. Her jaw had begun to  slide forward. Her face was drunk with the pleasure of the change. “D-don&#39;t forrrrrgett...” she growled at me, “You owe me something...something later..” She buried her face in her sister&#39;s mound once more, the snaps and pops of transforming tissue intensifying as she reached back between her own legs and stimulated herself.<br />
<br />
My own twat was something beyond boiling at this point, but I was enjoying the edging itself now. How long could I hold out? How long could I avoid the temptation to release myself to the beast? I reached my hand down between Lynn&#39;s legs, toying with her clit as her sister licked her. My fingers found another piercing down there, and I roughly toyed with it as well, causing her to let out a howl as her muzzle pushed outward, while her sister&#39;s muzzle pushed into her. The house reeked of lycanthropic pheromones, sweat, and cum. A second howl echoed from between Lynn&#39;s thighs as Lacey brought herself to orgasm, soaking my floor with her hot cum.<br />
<br />
They stayed in that position, with Lacey eventually moving her head more to Lynn&#39;s lap; the “older” wolf stroking the blue fur on the top of her head, while I smoothed the black fur on top of hers. I slipped off the couch, sliding a hand to each of their furry vulvas, stroking each of them to an orgasm almost simultaneously, while willing their pussies to have more power. It enabled my wish, that any wolf I changed sexually, for them to have stronger pheromones. They both surged toward me, only for me to hold up a hand. “Not yet, my darlings,” I said with a smile. “For now, change back.”<br />
<br />
The wolves nodded and began to writhe and moan as their bodies shrank, their sandy blonde fur sliding back into their skin, and soon it was just two naked young women with me, one a cheerful looking blue-haired girl and one that was pale and darkly aspected. Lacey immediately turned to her sister and planted a long kiss on her, one that was returned without hesitation, and for the first time, I saw Lynn smile.<br />
<br />
“Mom CANNOT find out about this,” Lynn said, even as she followed it up with another kiss.<br />
<br />
I smiled. “Actually, girls..where do you think your mother was when she called you?”<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” Lacey said. “Seriously?”<br />
<br />
I nodded. “She&#39;s the first warrior I made. Which means that she also won&#39;t care about your relationship. Wolves don&#39;t worry so much about that as a taboo. You might want to be a little discreet though, until your father has joined the pack. Don&#39;t worry though, you&#39;ll be able to smell it on him, so you won&#39;t have to wonder.”<br />
<br />
Lynn&#39;s face lit up with emotion. “You mean..we can..BE?” She tugged on Lacey&#39;s hand, and patted her lap. Lacey climbed up and wrapped her legs around her sister&#39;s back, holding herself tightly against her.<br />
Lynn&#39;s voice was soft as she touched her forehead to her sister&#39;s. “You&#39;re the perfect person for me. The only true constant in my life. You&#39;re my sister, my lover, my wolf. You&#39;re my ONE. Even if we fuck other people, you&#39;re my ONE. Don&#39;t ever forget that.”<br />
<br />
Lacey immediately began to cry and kissed Lynn deeply and softly. “Yeah..” she sniffled. “S-same..”<br />
<br />
Lynn&#39;s eyes sparkled with tears and she giggled. “Don&#39;t start that, dearest..you&#39;ll get me going too..” She sniffled a bit as they nuzzled. Naked and against each other, but nothing sexual. The sex would break the intimacy of the moment. I watched but didn&#39;t say anything. It wasn&#39;t my place. For a few minutes, despite the fact they were in my home, in the presence of their new goddess, I didn&#39;t really exist for them.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Lacey slipped off of the couch and re-dressed, passing Lynn&#39;s clothes to her. I slipped my sundress back on, even as both of the girls looked at me with a bit of hunger. Now that they were werewolves, while my bared twat might arouse them, it wouldn&#39;t have the same mesmeric power it held earlier, unless I was deliberately pushing pheromones.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” I said, once all of us were fully clothed once more. My sundress brushed my pussy lightly and I shivered. I&#39;d been edging myself so hard and so long; it was a beautiful agony. My nipples immediately went rigid. A couple loud snaps erupted as my tendons began to stretch. My thighs quivered. Both girls let out sympathetic moans, and their eyes glimmered with lupine energy threatening to emerge. I fought it down. <br />
<br />
“We need to discuss what&#39;s to come..”</p>
