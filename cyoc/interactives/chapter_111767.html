<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We open the doors to the school and walk into the front office. I walk up to the front desk and start to sign us both in. I look at the middle-aged receptionist who is lost in her typing. &quot;Hello, Ms. Sloane. Having a nice day so far?&quot; She answers, &quot;I&#39;m doing fine. How may I help you?&quot;, before looking up from her screen. In shock at my new appearance she leans over the counter and looks me over. &quot;Sir?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah Ms. Sloane?&quot; She reads through the sign in sheet and squints at my face. &quot;Danny? Danny Hernandez?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am. Is something wrong?&quot; I try to act as innocent as possible, to make this even funnier. Still shocked she looks behind me to see Ava standing in her huge trench coat waiting by the door. Ava waves at the lady and she shakily waves back. Ms. Sloan sits back in her chair. &quot;No. No problem. Your kids go ahead inside. I think it&#39;s your lunch period.&quot; Ava and I both say &quot;Thanks Ms. Sloane. Have a nice day&quot; and head out the door into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Ava and I walk the empty halls hand in hand until we get to the cafeteria doors. &quot;Oh Danny. I don&#39;t have my lunch money I was supposed to get it when I went home yesterday.&quot; I smile and wish up her favorite meal in a take out bag behind my back. I hand it to her. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just your favorite sushi from Tanaka&#39;s.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aw, thanks babe!&quot; she says before she kisses me on the cheek. &quot;No problem A. Now lets go in. You ready?&quot; She peeks in the door at all of our classmates already sitting and eating their lunches. &quot;Sure. Lets go.&quot; She holds out her hand and I take it and a deep breath before we push through the doors. As soon as we walk in, a couple of faces turn in our direction. I can tell they are mostly looking at me because lots of girls who previously paid me no mind are basically undressing me with their eyes. Ava&#39;s coat is still covering up her new figure so she just looks like she dressed for slightly colder Chicago weather. One girl from our class, Tiffany Stevens, stands up and walks over. Tiffany is pretty popular but she mostly gains her &quot;friends&quot; through fear of being humiliated instead of actually being nice to people. Basically a &quot;Regina George&quot;, Tiffany &quot;owns&quot; the school and expects to get what she wants. And with her walking over, I can tell exactly what she wants. Tiff strides over with an extra swing in her hips and an extra hop in her step to make her boobs almost jump out of her way-too-low-for-school tank top. I look to Ava who sees this too and has steam starting to come out of her ears. I lean down to her and whisper in her ear &quot;Don&#39;t worry babe. I&#39;ve seen better.&quot; Ava chuckles and Tiffany finally makes it over to us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you Ava for giving this new...man a tour of the school but I can take it from here,&quot; Tiffany says without breaking eye contact with me once and pushing up her boobs with the sides of her arms. Tiff has no idea that its me. Ava responds &quot;Um Tiffany, this is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he can surely speak for himself. Now run along. Don&#39;t you usually sit next to that loser Danny or something?&quot; Ava feigns insult and goes to sit at our usual empty table. At this point, majority of the cafeteria has caught on that Tiffany is making her move on me and is watching us. Its not everyday that the Infamous Tiffany Stevens makes direct contact with a newcomer and if I was them, I would be watching too.<br />
<br />
Tiffany holds my arm and starts to guide me to her table. &quot;Oh Ava. Isn&#39;t she just so sweet? So innocent.&quot; I smirk. &#39;If she only knew.&#39; Tiffany gives my arm a squeeze. &quot;Wow. You&#39;re really strong. Were you a star athlete at your old school?&quot; I stop. &quot;Well actually I&#39;m in theater and the chess team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quadruple threat. Strong, smart, sensitive, AND unbelievably handsome. Where have you been all my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Tiff, we&#39;ve gone to the same schools since third grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany squirms at the nickname. &quot;Normally people call me &#39;Tiffany&#39; but I guess I can make and exception for you big guy. But what do you mean you know me? What corner have you been hiding in? I definitely would have noticed you. What is your name?&quot; Tiffany puts her hands on her hips demanding an answer. The cafeteria goes silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiff, its me. &#39;That loser Danny Hernandez&#39;.&quot; The cafeteria ignites with whispers and murmurs. Tiff laughs &quot;You? Danny? Ha! Nice one,&quot; but then she squints and looks into my eyes. &quot;Holy shit. You ARE Danny.&quot; She looks me up and down in complete shock. &quot;My, you sure have changed. Been working out lately? It certainly has worked out for you. And I like what you&#39;ve done with your hair. Very flattering.&quot;<br />
<br />
I do my best not to laugh in her face. &quot;Thanks. Now I&#39;m going to go sit next to my girlfriend. See you in class.&quot; I walk over to my table with Ava waiting for me and sit down. But Tiff isn&#39;t done yet. She storms over, not ready to lose to Ava.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s your girlfriend? I know you had your little crush but get real. She has a cute face but the rest of her? Ava isn&#39;t nearly woman enough for you.&quot; Tiff leans over the opposite side of the table trying to press her breasts in my face. The cafeteria has gone silent again with everyone watching Tiff trying to steal away me from Ava. Instead of giving to her cheap game, I turn to Ava. &quot;Ava, babe, you look hot in your coat. Why don&#39;t I take it off for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Danny.&quot; Ava responds coyly. Tiffany scoffs while we both stand up. I stand behind Ava and slide the trench coat of her shoulders, blinding Tiffany and the rest of the cafeteria with her presence. Tiffany gets off the table reduced to stammering. I get a good look at my girl who is beaming with pride. &quot;What did you say about me not being woman enough, Tiff?&quot; Ava places her hands on her hips and shakes her chest.<br />
<br />
Tiffany backs away slowly, trying to recover some of her ego. &quot;Whatever. They&#39;re probably fake. Ass too. Danny when you want a real woman, let me know.&quot; Tiff practically runs back to her regular table to be fawned over and consoled by her cheer squad. Ava turns back to me smiling and wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me. &quot;This was way more fun than I imagined, Danny. Thanks for this.&quot; I lean down and kiss her back, pulling her lower back closer to me. The cafeteria erupts into &quot;ooooh&quot;&#39;s and whistles and we split apart laughing. I pull out Ava&#39;s seat and we sit down for lunch. I go through the take out bag and set up the sushi and wish for two bottles of Ava&#39;s favorite pineapple soda. They appear with a small &quot;pop&quot; on the table. &quot;You&#39;ve thought of everything, haven&#39;t you Daniel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve thought about this a lot.&quot; I grab her soda and pop the lid off the glass bottle with my bare hands. &quot;I just want to have a nice lunch, with my lady.&quot; I pop the cap off mine and she picks up her chopsticks. She grabs a big piece of tuna. &quot;Here Danny. Let me feed you.&quot; She pops the piece in my mouth. I chew, swallow and then do the same to her. Some of the sauce drips off the top and lands on her chest. I take my thumb and wipe it off slowly, letting it linger more than it needs to before licking my thumb. She feigns a blush and moves her seat closer to mine. She takes a drink of her soda, letting some of it splash off her lips and onto her shirt. Ava licks her lips and leans back into her chair. I turn back to eat some of my sushi but Ava isn&#39;t done yet. She uses her strong legs to push my chair back from the table and climbs on top of my lap so we&#39;re face to face. Her breasts are squishing up against my chest and I can feel the lace of her bra through our shirts. I flex my pecs a few times to make her boobs bounce around. She leans back, locking her legs under the chair to keep herself balanced and giving a nice view of her flat stomach and the underwire of her bra, and grabs the sushi and chopsticks from the table. Ava leans forward again, breast to chest and picks up a piece of salmon. &quot;Let me feed you baby. A big boy like you needs to your energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can say nothing else but &quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot;. Ava sticks the salmon in my mouth, barely letting me chew before picking up another piece. &quot;How about a little more heat, huh? It&#39;ll put some hair on your chest.&quot; She smears some wasabi on the next one and pops it in my mouth. It&#39;s hot but nothing I can&#39;t handle. To tease her, I make a wish and rip open my shirt from the coller, revealing my strong new body to the intrigued student body. &quot;This hairy enough for ya?&quot; Small hairs sprout all over my chest until I have a curly pelt covering my pecs and a happy trail heading south. To add a little more flavor, a shadow of a beard and mustache grow on my face. Ava purrs &quot;Hmm. Very nice. But you&#39;re not done eating yet.&quot; Ava rips open her hoodie, revealing a massive amount of cleavage being held back by her super sexy red lace bra. She pleans back again to the table, her breasts only barely managing to not spill out due to the magic bra and grabs her soda. Ava opens the bottle and drinks again, this time letting the soda fall all over her bare breasts. &quot;Try the Mahi with some pineapple,&quot; she cooes seductively into my ear before wedging a piece inbetween her breasts. She pushes them up towards my face, letting them balance on top of my pecs. There they lay, glistening in pineapple soda and sweat, only for me filling me with a second and better type of hunger. I growl &quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot; and lap up the piece of sushi in my mouth. I swallow quickly and go back down into Ava&#39;s jugs. I lick her bare chest, savoring the flavor of her juices and the pineapple mixing together. She locks her knees behind my back and wraps her arms behind my neck. My erection grows steadily underneath my jeans and I know that soon her amazing mams won&#39;t be enough.</p>
