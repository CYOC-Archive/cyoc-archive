<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben decided that if he added 50 pounds to his 190 frame, especially if it were muscle, he could handle that.  He giggled to himself, I won’t be as strange as those muscle freaks, but I will stand out of the crowd.  <br />
<br />
Ben confidently typed in 50 at the prompt and sat back, expecting to enjoy the wonderful changes in his physique.   Almost immediately he felt a warm tingling in his body.  It was hard to describe.  He closed his eyes to appreciate the feeling of his hard muscles bulking up, pushing against his clothes.<br />
<br />
Not even thinking twice about it, he had to shift in his chair to accommodate his changing body.  He felt so strong and powerful that he was sure he could take on the world with confidence.  Ben felt as though he were a super-concentrated mass of power and energy. <br />
<br />
He didn’t want to loose the experience, but his feet were beginning to hurt badly, so he pushed off one shoe with his other foot and almost fell off the chair.  His weight had shifted so much that he grabbed at the side to keep from falling, but his hand missed.  Ben rolled onto the floor and broke out in a cold sweat.<br />
<br />
Something was definitely wrong.  Now he felt sick and nauseous and was about to scream because of all the pain, he felt his bones popping and he seemed to be encased, trapped in his clothes.  It was all too much for him to handle.  The moment was gone.  There was something terribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Ben tried to stand up, but fell over again and decided to take it slow and easy; figure things out slowly and fix any mistakes.  He noticed that for now the changes had stopped, so with his powerful arms, he pushed himself up and started to survey the damage.  <br />
<br />
The first thing Ben noticed was that his hands seemed so small … but powerful at the same time.  He had a hard time looking over his massive pecs, but he was able to push himself up into a sitting position.  Then he realized it.  His clothes were just too big for him.  He felt a cold rush in his stomach… his clothes should be too small… <br />
<br />
Ben slowly unlatched his belt and pulled down his pants.  It wasn’t easy, his overly stacked body would not move into the positions that he wanted.  After he had finally wrenched off his pants, he decided to leave his shirt on and get back to the computer to see what the program said.  <br />
<br />
When Ben stood up, he got the shock of his life.  Where his t-shirt was definitely stretching across his chest (almost transparent because of the tight fit), it also came down to almost mid-thigh.  Pushing aside the sinking feeling, Ben made his way back to the computer and check out the screen.<br />
<br />
He had filled in the wrong blank.  There blinking back at him from the screen were the words, “Height in inches: 50 – Saved As Default”.  Ben was now 4 feet, 2 inches tall.  At 190 pounds of muscle, he looked like a super pumped-up bodybuilder.  He laughed to himself… “I can fix this, I’m sure…” and he decided to run to the bathroom to check out his “mistake” in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
The first thing Ben noticed was how much further it was to the bathroom now.  When he got there, he also noticed that although he could see his head in the mirror above the sink, that and his thick neck were about he was going to see.  He ran down to check himself out in the full-length mirror in the hall.  When he got there, the sight almost took his breath away.  Ben’s reflection was so thick and muscular his reflection barely fit into the mirror.  He immediately ripped his shirt over his head and stood staring at the diminutive muscle-god.  In his mind, he knew he was probably twice or three times the weight a man of this stature should be, but his pecs and biceps and torso were ripped beyond even his wildest dreams.  As he turned slowly in the mirror, he was overcome with lust for his magnificent arse and powerful and thick thighs.  His calf muscles were beyond comparing and he stood there in the midst, overcome with how tiny and powerful his feet looked.  Ben giggled to himself, thinking they looked more like flippers, being so wide; but when taking in the powerful proportions of his body, they were perfect for him.  As he stood there, enraptured with his reflection, he noticed his tight eight-pack.  He pushed one of his short, thick fingers into one of the ridges and the tip of his finger was swallowed into it.  He smiled to himself in the mirror and noticed how prominent and square his jaw now was.  He reached up to touch his now wide nipple and was overcome by the new sensations that his body was sending to his brain.  He was overwhelmed by testosterone and pheromones.<br />
<br />
He looked down as his cock sprang to life.  Ben’s jaw dropped open when he saw that his normal-sized penis now looked like monster-meat on his compacted body.  His small hands couldn’t even encircle the whole thing and it was longer than both fists.  All he could do was stroke with his hands, trying to control how much longer it was getting.  When it was finally, fully erect, the tip hit his overly sensitive nipple and he raged at himself.  If he hadn’t been so muscular, he would have been able to bend his head down and take it into his mouth.  Dammit.  I’m too big.  The feelings and emotions were driving Ben crazy until finally, bearing no more stimulations, his cock erupted into buckets of  spooge.  The fountain erupted onto his face and his hands were quickly overflowing with his hot man juice.  He rubbed it all over his ripped, muscular body and stood there, shining with cum and sweat from head to foot.  “I guess I don’t have to worry about not getting the sucker in my mouth…”  and Ben laughed to himself.  <br />
<br />
He was almost afraid to take a shower and clean up, his new condensed body seemed ready to explode again if any of his senses would be stimulated.  He was right.  He laughed again as he lifted up his powerful leg and stood in the tub.  When he turned on the water, he realized that he was going to have to stand on the edge of the tub to change the direction of the flow.  <br />
<br />
Once that was accomplished, he pulled the shower curtain and began to explore his new body.  And he was right, the stimulation took him once again over the edge.  When he finally was able to stop he scampered down the hall to his bedroom to see if he could find any clothes that he could “make” fit.  Once again he was entranced by his reflection and suddenly noticed, his ball sac was hanging down, halfway between his crotch and his knees.  No wonder his body was so horny, sex crazed  and insatiable.  <br />
<br />
When he was finally able to peel himself away from his refection, he found an older pair of jeans from when he had gained a little weight.  He rolled up the legs into very wide cuffs, but underwear was completely out of the question.  Nothing he had would fit.  As he pulled on a pair of socks, he laughed again… they came more than halfway up his calf.  <br />
<br />
Since Ben didn’t want to go without a shirt and he didn’t want one that hung down to his knees, he quickly cut off a t-shirt he had that just barely would fit around his chest.  The last problem was insurmountable.  He had no shoes or sandals or anything to wear on his feet.  He even tried putting on two pairs of socks, but his feet were now way too wide.  <br />
<br />
As Ben scampered back to the computer, he was going to be sure that there was only one change he was going to make until he had discovered everything this new body was going to show him.  He quickly found shoe size, and out of practicality, changed his foot to a size 9 regular.  His feet were considerably out of proportion with his body, but he was going to have to go out and get shoes if he was going to adapt to this new frame.  <br />
<br />
Ben saved the changes and powered down the machine; it was going to be a long shopping spree and he wanted to prepare for some other changes to his body which he had never considered before.  As he turned his key in the lock and headed down the hall he thought to himself, “This is going to be the adventure of a lifetime.” And smiled to himself as he got into the elevator.</p>
