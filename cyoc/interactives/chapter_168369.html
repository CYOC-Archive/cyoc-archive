<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Man, what a haul,&quot; mused John as he looked through the bags. He and Chris had stopped about a hundred yards off the main path, in a nice grassy clearing in the woods about four miles from town. They&#39;d stopped to get a good look at their loot before finishing the long walk back to their hideout. The bags were full of old and rare artifacts that the boys didn&#39;t really recognize except to know that most of them were insanely valuable. Chris had been skeptical of raiding the old lady&#39;s cabin after the rumors he&#39;d heard about her being a witch, and he still had a funny feeling about that bird they&#39;d almost run away with, but he&#39;d put that all behind him now. Chris was right: this was the jackpot!<br />
<br />
Speaking of Chris, he&#39;d already stepped away over behind a tree in the middle of the meadow for some reason. John didn&#39;t care why, being too busy looking through the loot. That was until Chris&#39;s voice emerged from behind the tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, John, come over here and check this out.&quot; John looked up, laid a pretty gold chalice back down into one of the bags, and walked over to meet Chris. When he got there, we was surprised to see John sitting on the ground with his trousers off, exposing a very noticeable erection.<br />
<br />
Now, Chris and John had both run away from home at a young age to live as thieves; they had gone through puberty together, and this certainly wasn&#39;t the first time John had seen Chris jacking off. What was surprising to John this time was that Chris&#39;s maleness was long, red and swollen, with a thick patch of tawny fur around the base and all over his scrotum. It didn&#39;t look normal at all, but it did look familiar somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what happened to your dick? Is that normal at our age?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, man, but why don&#39;t you see whether yours has changed, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was good advice, so John stripped himself down a little bit and gasped when he saw that his dick and balls were encased in a new layer of fine fur and skin that held his manhood tight up against his groin. He couldn&#39;t believe he hadn&#39;t noticed this happening! He lay down on the grass and grabbed at the new arrangement, trying to get a feel for what happened to him. Fondling his new sheath felt good, and soon John could see a glistening pink organ poking out the end of the warm, fuzzy pouch. It didn&#39;t take much experimentation to get it sticking out further. Before long, both boys had discovered the firm purple bulge at the base of their new penis that emerged when their erection was complete. Finally getting a good solid grip on this extra-sensitive region pushed them totally over the edge. They both let out a loud moan or yell that sounded almost like a howl as they continued to grasp their new genitals, falling deep into the longest and most intense orgasm of their relatively young lives.<br />
<br />
Quite a few minutes later, their long pointed dicks had finally stopped squirting their clear liquid onto the ground, and the thieves were left panting and quite surprised that they were still erect after all that. It took several more minutes for their swollen bulbs to soften and burrow back down into the strange warm layer of skin and fur on their crotch. As John watched the moist red shaft of his new toy getting swallowed up another inch further into its convenient casing, he couldn&#39;t help but feel like he still had doubts about all this, but the pleasure and the sheer novelty enticed him to just go with the flow for now. He looked over to find that Chris was still leaning up against the tree, hanging his tongue out in bliss.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the shit right there, man,&quot; said Chris in a dazed voice when he was finally able to speak again. His exposed penis was basically a little pink point at the top his sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but, ... are you sure that ... sure that this okay? I mean ... is this normal?&quot; John panted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You worry too much, John. ... Hey, do you ... ?&quot; Chris&#39;s voice trailed off as he got a sudden urge to sniff the air. John saw that Chris&#39;s nostrils had turned black at the end of his nose. Chris leaned over and started sniffing at John&#39;s sheath, which was sticky with semen but no longer had his penis sticking out of it. He moaned as he breathed in the fresh sex hormones of the fellow male who had ejaculated alongside him. There was something else, though, something that was tantalizing his sudden olfactory curiosity...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, John. Stand up and turn around for me, will ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Chris... Chris your nose--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you questioning me, John?&quot; Chris sounded firm and insistent, and John was going to capitulate as usual. He jumped up and stood, still undressed, with his rear end facing back toward his friend. Chris finally got his dark wet nostrils in near the crack of John&#39;s butt and took in as much of the information as he could from back there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh boy, John, you really are nervous ... (sniff, sniff) ... and why didn&#39;t you tell me you were getting sick on that soup I made? ... (sniff) ... and---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--Chris, come on, you&#39;re starting to freak me out...&quot; whined John. Chris stood up and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, John, I can smell that I&#39;m making you uncomfortable. Why don&#39;t I give you a turn? Fair is fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t want to admit that he was also curious about the smells coming from Chris, too. It had happened over the last few minutes that he was bombarded with odors coming in every direction, and he was immediately drawn to the anus that Chris was displaying to him. He took a few cautious whiffs. His friend smelled very dominant, which wasn&#39;t too surprising since Chris usually called the shots. He tried not to linger on it too long, but he also didn&#39;t challenge Chris when he suggested they head out. The boys got themselves dressed again, picked up their loot, and made their way back toward the path.</p>
