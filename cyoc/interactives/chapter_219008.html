<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob gazed at the coffee shop, waiting for Claudia to meet up with Sarah. The plan was simple, yet so many things could go wrong.<br />
<br />
Claudia would meet with the agent, talk with her as Rick, Cole, and Jacob listened in. Thankfully, due to Claudia&#39;s paranoia about the meeting, they had chosen a public space. Now, sitting in Jacob&#39;s truck, the former hunter and former Marine gazed at the shop waiting for something to happen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Coffee?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob turned to Cole, the Marine extending a thermos cup filled with black coffee. &quot;Now you&#39;re speaking my language,&quot; he smirked, taking the hot liquid and gulping some down. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Jacob replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah used to drink this all the time on guard duty,&quot; Cole said. &quot;Coffee and chew were standard issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; Jacob replied. &quot;The coffee, not the chew. Grandpa used to love chewing tobacco til he got mouth cancer. After he passed I swore I wouldn&#39;t touch the stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I gave it up too after a few years,&quot; Cole replied. &quot;All it took was a few sores and I said no thank you. By the time Kumi and I got together I hadn&#39;t touched the stuff in about 3 years.&quot; Jacob simply nodded, studying the massive Marine that was now driving his car. Taking Jacob&#39;s car had seemed like the best option. DHS probably knew what Cole and Ricks cars looked like, but not Jacob&#39;s. The only problem was, Jacob only had one arm. If they needed to make a quick escape it made sense for someone else drive. &quot;I&#39;m still surprised you let me drive,&quot; Cole said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Ricks gonna be busy,&quot; Jacob shrugged. &quot;And if it turns jnto a firefight I&#39;d have to make a choice between firing my gun or driving. You can do both.&quot; Cole nodded, checking over his Desrt Eagle as Jacob quickly examined his revolver. &quot;You think it&#39;ll come to that,&quot; Cole asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope not but I&#39;d rather be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Cole asked, trying to find something else to talk about. &quot;The whole Goldilocks thing? Is that the strangest thing you&#39;ve seen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even close,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Not even the first fairytale character I&#39;ve run into. Went werewolf hunting with Little Red Riding Hood.&quot; Cole paused, a flummoxed look on his face as he stared at Jacob. &quot;Are you serious?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Jscob nodded. &quot;Was actually Novas last assignment before she retired. Rabid werewolf pack running amuck in the Pacific Northwest. Red was a real pro, real pretty too. Pretty sure Nina was jealous as hell of her.&quot; Cole laughed softly, shaking his head at the thought. &quot;Man I thought Afghanistan was crazy,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Any reason why Red Riding Hood was helping you hunt werewolves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes the best when it comes to that kind of thing,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Kind of a specialist hunters employ from time to time. Her and I were strictly professional but ya got to remember. Nina and I were still young. Seeing a buxom redhead being cozy with your boyfriend is gonna drive any girl nuts.&quot; Cole simply nodded, understanding before noticing a woman in her thirties exit her car. &quot;I think that&#39;s her,&quot; he said. &quot;Rick are we ready?&quot; Rick nodded, switching on the wire as the trio watched Sarah McMillan enter the coffee shop. Hopefully this encounter would go smoothly.<br />
<br />
*********************************<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled, offering a polite wave as she noticed Claudia sitting in a booth towards the back of the coffee shop. Although the conversation they had over the phone was pleasant, she could tell Claudia wasn&#39;t exactly keen on interviewing with her. When the young mother recommended meeting here, Sarah already knew she was anxious about it. Whatever happened between her and Dyson had obviously spooked her.  &quot;Thanks for meeting with me Claudia,&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure no problem,&quot; Claudia replied stiffly. Sarah maintained her pleasant demeanor, she wasn&#39;t interested on arresting Claudia or any of her siblings. She simply was looking for answers. &quot;Would you like some coffee,&quot; Sarah offered. &quot;My treat.&quot; Claudia nodded, the agent placing an order for two coffees as she now opened her notebook. &quot;Wanted to thank you again for meeting with me. I just have a few questions about Alec Dyson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Claudia said softly, her body tense as she gazed at the agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Alec ask you any questions about your father?&quot; Claudia nodded, remembering how Alec Dyson approached her a few days before he kidnapped Cole. As Sarah listened she could tell the young mom did not like her old mentor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So after Alec talked with you he talked with your brother,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you have any idea what they said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d have to ask Cole,&quot; Claudia grumbled. &quot;Pretty sure it&#39;s in whatevwr report Dyson made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes some information is,&quot; Sarah replied looking over the old case notes. &quot;But here&#39;s the thing. The report is incomplete, he talked with your brother and then immediately vanished. Any idea what could have happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea,&quot; Claudia shrugged. &quot;Probably dead. Guy was a bit of an asshole if I&#39;m being honest. Probably got what was coming to him.&quot; Outisde, in Jacob&#39;s car, the three men all groaned at Claudia&#39;s outburst. Calling a missing federal agent an asshole was probably not the best way to to get the feds off your case. Sarah though, simply nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Alec could be a bit prickly,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;But he was a good agent, he mentored me when I started. I&#39;m just trying to figure out what happened to him.&quot; Claudia shrugged, she had no answer or at least no answer the agent would believe. Sarah though could sense something, she just needed to push a little harder. &quot;I saw your children yesterday when I stopped by.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia furrowed her brow, Sarah watching the woman carefully. Obviously Sarah had struck a nerve, what she wasn&#39;t expecting though was to see Claudia coffee begin to boil. It started simply, Sarah watching steam drift off the liquid. The steam though quickly began to turn into a boil. As Sarah watched, she could see the coffee grow hotter and hotter, almost to the point of boiling over. By the time Claudia noticed, the petite sorceress&#39;s eyes were wide with fright. &quot;Claudia are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia simply nodded, Sarah narrowing her eyes as she looked the young mother over.  &quot;You know something,&quot; Sarah said softly. &quot;I can tell you have information on Alec. So, I&#39;ll be honest with you and hope you&#39;ll be honest with me. Can we agree on that?&quot;&quot; Claudia simply nodded, her eyes now focusing on Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Alec was a bit of an eccentric,&quot; Sarah sighed. &quot;He was a bit of a conspiracy buff. Area 51, little green men, supernatural conspiracies and the like. Alot of people didn&#39;t believe him. I did. He taught me alot when I started. Looked out for me. I just want to know what happened to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I could help but I don&#39;t know,&quot; Claudia stated. Sarah simply sighed, she could tell she had almost gotten the truth, she just needed to press a bit harder. &quot;How about your kids? Any reason they&#39;re part animal? I think the term is lycanthropy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw it with my own eyes Claudia,&quot; Sarah said softly. &quot;One of your babysitters was holding one of your children when it happened. They tried to hide it but I was watching too closely.&quot; Claudia fidgeted, this woman definitely knew something was up and was aware of her children&#39;s supernatural nature. She hadn&#39;t guessed right but she was awfully close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia listen,&quot; Sarah said softly. &quot;I didn&#39;t come here to take your kids. I didn&#39;t even come here to hurt you. I just want to know what happened to Alec. That&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah McMillan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah turned, her eyes growing wide as she gazed at two large men standing behind her. One she immediately recognized as Coke Harris. The other man was missing an arm and sporting a duster and cowboy hat. Quickly sizing the pair up she could see they were armed. &quot;Who are you,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob,&quot; he said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you leave the girl alone and come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I refuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really an option,&quot; Cole stated. Sarah gauged the two men as well as Claudia. Trying to fight off all three was certainly not an option. &quot;We ain&#39;t gonna hurt ya,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;But you&#39;re obviously smart and got alot of questions. You want answers you come with us.&quot;</p>
