<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The once couple were sitting in the plain room, and Joe coming to his senses asked &quot;What did happen to Victoria? She is my daughter Julia, and I love her so-&quot; <br />
Julia said &quot;I&#39;m pregnant with her.&quot; As a silence grew as Joe seemed a little shocked Julia explained &quot;I was saving myself on earth for you, and I kinda wanted to see what being pregnant was like. Victoria herself also wanted to do it as well. I guess she was basically just conceived and now I&#39;ll have to carry her for 9 months... or maybe longer or shorter depending on how this time room works or how our heavenly bodies work.&quot; <br />
Joe conjuring up a cup of tea to sip chuckled cautiously and after a small sip said &quot;...Not sure how much the other you is going to like that...&quot; <br />
Julia said &quot;By the way, for sake of alleviating confusion the woman you married is named Cynthia.&quot; Julia didn&#39;t mean to put any venom in her voice, but that didn&#39;t stop Joe from imagining it when Julia said &quot;woman you married&quot;. <br />
Joe put down his cup of tea sighed and said &quot;So, shall we talk about our relationship?&quot; Julia nodded creating a cup of... milk? No there was just a bit of a brown tint to it and... were those marshmallows? Ty that was decades ago! Cynthia really remembered that line and decided to tell Julia... Julia not talking and drinking from her warm marshmallow milk clued Joe in that it was still his turn to talk &quot;Well, from what I&#39;ve seen. You had waited your whole life to be with me. I&#39;m not sure how much Cynthia told you, but when I was first brought into heaven I begged for Ty to bring Stew and I right back... Then I thought I had. Cynthia was exactly the same person you were, and the world was exactly the same as well. How could I have known that Cynthia wasn&#39;t you? We spent the rest of... well she didn&#39;t die so my life together, sharing laughs, love, and a daughter. So when I found out... I&#39;m still not sure what to think. From your drink I think you know what my initial impression of you was like, but as the years passed and you matured I started to see things in Cynthia that I liked along with the things that Cynthia had grown out of and you hadn&#39;t. If I had to pick just one of you it would be hard, but I would&#39;ve stuck with Cynthia because we&#39;ve really been together longer and Victoria... Then again I&#39;m not sure how she even factors into this anymore.&quot; Joe leaned forward and held his head in his hands and said &quot;I&#39;ve spent these decades trying to keep both you, Cynthia, and Victoria happy. It is heaven for them and I want to see my family happy, but you are also kind of family in my heart so I&#39;ve been using the wishes Ty has granted me to make sure you never left needing for money or shelter or anything... Even swung probability a little to get you a few free all expense paid vacations, but I just... Couldn&#39;t be at peace. Seeing you be faithful made my heart soar, but also twisted it as how could I explain Cynthia without you blowing up at me! I kinda wished you could find someone else to marry and replace me so this could go smoother, but... I just don&#39;t know anymore! All I can do is justify and justify and justify and justify an-&quot; Joe felt a small peck on his forehead which broke him out of his Stupor. <br />
&quot;Joe, I&#39;m not mad. When I first saw Cynthia I had no idea what to think of either, but when I was watching Cynthia and your lives together... I felt that overall I had made the right choice in the man I picked to love. You were loyal, provided very well, you two had a beautiful child that I&#39;m glad I have the privilege to carry now, and you don&#39;t have to pick.&quot; <br />
&quot;Wha-&quot;Joe was lifting his head a bit and saw he was face to face with Julia who kissed him on the lips now. <br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to pick silly. It may be weird and unorthodox, but I kinda see Cynthia as a weird half-self half-sister and wouldn&#39;t mind sharing you and our child with her. While I don&#39;t know how she feels about sharing a daughter I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine sharing you with me. Heck I feel like she was planning all sorts of things to do together for decades.&quot; Julia smiled a little, she had mostly come to terms with a lot, and seeing that Joe was probably the one that needed to talk the most... Even him being a resident in heaven kinda made Julia feel... good. On earth she was saving herself for Joe and was hoping that he still loved her. That he may be watching her and that he wasn&#39;t disgusted at her or judging her or that he just wasn&#39;t interested because he was banging several perfect angels... However no. He had been loyal to a version of her and beating himself up because he wasn&#39;t sure he could be loyal to both her and other her. Joe still wasn&#39;t sure, but Julia took him by the hands and walked him out. She was sure that this whole threesome family would work out. <br />
<br />
&quot;TELL ME WHERE MY DAUGHTER IS NOW BITCH!&quot; Cynthia yelled out as soon as she the door to the room open. <br />
&quot;Well... she&#39;s in my womb. The woman several decades old decided she wanted to be given birth by the other woman her father loves as well.&quot; <br />
Cynthia glared to Joe who said &quot;I dunno, this is kinda between the three of you but Victoria does have the right to consent.&quot; <br />
Thus the weird family had their first fight.</p>
