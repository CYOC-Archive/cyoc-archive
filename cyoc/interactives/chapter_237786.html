<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff double-clicked the icon with a mix of excitement and trepidation. The program opened to reveal a sleek body swap interface with options to customize every aspect of his transformation: gender, race, age, even occupation. He scrolled through, feeling a thrill at the thought of experiencing life from such varied perspectives.<br />
<br />
But then Jeff made a huge mistake. He saw his families profiles and realized he could swap into them as well. He tried clicking on his moms profile to get more information, but then a sudden, sharp pain shot through his head, and the world around him swam. He blinked, and when he opened his eyes again, the walls of his room had vanished, replaced by the familiar yet foreign sight of his parents&#39; bedroom. Panic set in as he realized that instead of the cursor, he was controlling his own mother&#39;s body, tied to the bed, with his father standing over her.<br />
<br />
In a heart-stopping moment of horror, Jeff realized that he had swapped into his mother&#39;s body. He looked down and saw his naked form, feeling the softness of his mom’s skin and the heat of her desire. Her breasts, which were now his, felt heavy and sensitive to the cool air in the room. Her vagina, a place so intimate and alien to him, lay open and exposed, ready for his dad&#39;s touch. He tried to scream, but the tape over his new mouth muffled his voice into a barely audible whimper.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s dad, oblivious to the catastrophic mistake, began to grope her breasts with an enthusiasm that made Jeff’s stomach turn. His touch was firm, but not harsh, as if he had done this a thousand times before—which, in a way, he had. Jeff felt his mother’s body reacting, her chest rising and falling with each shallow breath she took, her heart hammering in her ears. He tried to ignore the sensation, to focus on anything else, but the feeling was overwhelming, a strange blend of arousal and revulsion.<br />
<br />
Then, his father’s hand trailed down her body, his fingers brushing against the slickness between her thighs. Jeff’s mind raced as he felt the alien sensation of his mother’s body responding to the touch. It was his hand, but it wasn’t his hand. He felt the wetness, the heat, the softness that was so utterly wrong and yet, in this bizarre context, so incredibly tantalizing. His dad’s eyes gleamed with desire, mistaking Jeff’s involuntary reactions for his mother’s.<br />
<br />
With a final kiss, Jeff’s dad stood up, revealing himself in all his naked glory. Jeff’s eyes were glued to the sight, his mind a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. He watched as his dad’s penis grew hard, pointing towards him, a silent demand that sent waves of dread and fascination through his body. He knew what was coming next, and despite the horror, his body seemed to have a mind of its own.<br />
<br />
He lined up his dick, the tip of it touching the wetness of Jeff’s new form. Jeff’s own mind recoiled at the thought, but the body he was in arched up, yearning for the connection it had craved for so long. His father’s eyes searched his, looking for the consent that Jeff was unable to give, yet the body beneath him seemed to be begging for it.<br />
<br />
As the pressure increased, Jeff felt the panic rise. This was wrong, so fundamentally wrong, and yet, his mother’s body was responding with a passion he had never experienced before. He tried to scream, to protest, but the tape over his mouth and the tightness of the ropes only allowed for muffled sounds that his dad took as encouragement. He pushed in, the sensation of being filled sending a jolt through Jeff’s soul. The pain was sharp, but it quickly gave way to a strange sense of fullness, a feeling he never thought he’d have.<br />
<br />
The room spun as Jeff felt himself being penetrated, his body’s instincts taking over, pushing back against his dad, urging for more despite the screaming in his mind. His eyes met his father’s, and for a brief moment, he saw the love and lust in his gaze. It was a look that was reserved for his mother, but now it was directed at him. Jeff’s dad began to thrust, the rhythmic motion sending waves of conflicting sensations through his body.<br />
<br />
The weight of his father’s body on top of him was suffocating, yet he felt a building pressure that was undeniably pleasurable. He felt the constant thump of his dad’s heavy balls against his clit, a sensation that was so wrong, yet his body was betraying him, reacting in a way that made him feel sick and alive at the same time. The room was a blur of motion, his father’s thrusts becoming more vigorous with every passing moment. The sound of their skin slapping together filled his ears, mingling with his own muffled moans.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s body was no longer his own, a vessel for his mother’s desires, a prison for his own. He closed his eyes tightly, trying to block out the reality, but the sensations were too intense, too real. His father’s hands held onto his hips, guiding him in a dance of passion that Jeff had never wanted to be a part of. He could feel the tension in his father’s body, the urgency of his movements, as he approached climax.<br />
<br />
The pressure built within him, a crescendo of sensations that he never thought possible. The disgust and horror were there, but so too was an unbearable arousal that seemed to stem from the very core of his being. His mind was a battlefield, torn between the love for his father and the innate human need to reject such a taboo act. Yet, his body responded, the walls of his vagina contracting around his dad’s cock, pulling him deeper, urging him on.<br />
<br />
The bed rocked beneath them, the headboard thumping against the wall in rhythm with their frenzied movements. The smell of sex filled the room, a cloying scent that made Jeff’s stomach turn. He felt his father’s muscles tense, and he knew that he was close to finishing. A part of him hoped it would end quickly, but another part, the part that was inexplicably tied to his mother’s desires, wanted it to go on forever.<br />
<br />
As Jeff’s dad reached his climax, the feeling was like nothing he had ever experienced before. The sensation of being filled, of being claimed, washed over him in a wave of ecstasy that seemed to consume every part of him. His mother’s body shuddered beneath the weight of her husband’s release, and he could feel the hot spurt of semen filling him up, the sticky wetness spreading deep within. His own body responded with a spasm of pleasure that made his eyes roll back in his head, and he realized with a sense of horror that he was having an orgasm, too.<br />
<br />
The room fell silent except for their heavy breathing, his dad’s weight still pressing down on him. The reality of what had just happened crashed over Jeff like a cold shower. He had just experienced something so fundamentally wrong, so utterly taboo, that he didn’t know how to process it. He felt dirty, violated, and yet, his body had enjoyed it. What the fuck was he going to do now?</p>
