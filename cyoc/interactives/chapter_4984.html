<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer revealed her plan to her friends.  They all thought it was great.  Miranda would get hers.  Jennifer was slightly troubled, though.  Like Jamie, she felt guilty about Kylie.  She had to know that Kylie would be OK with her plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, she used Kyle for her own reasons, making us come after him.  Do you think this is an appropriate revenge for her?&quot;  Kylie winced and said, &quot;First of all, I wish you would all stop mentioning him.&quot;  She was unable to even mention his name.  &quot;Especially you,&quot; she added, looking at Jamie.  &quot;Jenn, she meant to humiliate you.  You're going to give it back to her and then some, apparently.  Do as you want.&quot;  Jennifer was satisfied.  She could exact her revenge.  <br />
<br />
The bell rang, informing the students that school was about to begin.  Jamie said, &quot;OK, we'll see you at lunch.  Kylie and I conveniently have all the same classes.  I'll have to fill her in on why you've picked some of the things for Miranda's curse, Jenn.&quot;  Once again taking Kylie by the hand, she said, &quot;See you all later.&quot;  They walked off hand in hand.<br />
<br />
The other three stayed behind for a minute.  Trish asked, &quot;What do you think of all that?&quot;  Jennifer said, &quot;I don't know.  It seems weird, but I think that it's fine.  I feel like I'm supposed to be mad, but I'm not.&quot;  Liz agreed, &quot;They're our friends.  What would it say about us if we didn't support them?  The one good thing people have to say about us would mean nothing.&quot;  Trish nodded her head in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'll see you two at lunch,&quot; Jennifer said, walking off.  Looking back over her shoulder she said, &quot;We'll finish the plan at lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It seemed to take forever for lunch to come.  When it did, Jennifer, Liz, Trish, Jamie and Kylie gathered at the table they always occupied.  Well, the table always occupied by the four minus Kylie.  Jennifer asked, &quot;Has anyone seen Miranda yet?&quot;  Trish responded, &quot;I saw her in my second class.  She didn't look at me.  I kept glancing at her to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good then,&quot; Jennifer stated.  &quot;Like Jamie said, she probably has no idea what awaits her.&quot;  She turned to Jamie and asked, &quot;Did you tell Kylie about everything from yesterday?&quot;  Kylie answered the question first.  &quot;Yes, she did.  I've gotta say that you all have quite the imagination.  Especially this hot, little woman right here,&quot; Kylie said as she pinched Jamie's ass.  Jamie was somewhat startled by Kylie acting out in this way.  But she did like it.  Still she said, &quot;Let's not gross out our friends, babe.&quot;  Liz said, &quot;Eh, it's no worse than what Dylan does to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer interrupted, &quot;Let's stay focused here.  When are we going to do this?&quot;  Trish said, &quot;I thought we were doing it today.&quot;  Liz agreed.  Jamie said, &quot;Kylie and I have to do something else, too.  If we're going to do it today, it better be right after school.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Despite the fact that she couldn't care that much about Jamie and Kylie and their need to talk to Jamie's parents, she did want to take her revenge as quickly as possible.  &quot;Then we do it today,&quot; Jennifer decided.  <br />
<br />
Jamie had an idea she thought we help ensure the success of their plan.  &quot;Jenn, to make sure that she doesn't actually pick one or the other, we should all kind of taunt her.  That way she'll be more worried about talking back to us, and her time to decide will run out.&quot;  Trish agreed, &quot;Yea, Jenn, that sounds like a really good idea.  And actually, we could go one step further than that.&quot;  Trish whispered an idea to the rest of them.  They all laughed.  Jenn smiled.  &quot;This is great.  We're all working together.  This is when we'll get her...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miranda Kirkson was walking through the halls of the school.  It was 3:30 and most everyone had left for the day, students and teachers alike.  She stayed later, as always, for extra credit work for her economics class.  All that involved was reading the stock market report and summarizing the day's activity. <br />
<br />
Of course, that wasn't really why she stayed.  The economics teacher, Mr. Bertonelli, was attracted to her.  He was only 25 and couldn't help resist being seduced by the 18 year old brunette beauty.  Nothing had ever actually happened, though Miranda expected something to happen every day.  She knew that no one could resist her charms and her curvaceous body.  Her measurements were 36-21-34.  She had generous C cup breasts.  Her lips were fully and pouty and she had the face of an angel to match it.  Many people regarded her as the most beautiful girl in the school.  <br />
<br />
She slowly strode back to her locker.  She needed only to grab a few things from there, and then go to the locker room to pick up her gym attire.  Then she would be able to leave this hellhole for the day.  Her locker was only 25 feet or so from the girl's locker room.  As she took the lock off her locker, she thought she heard the door down the hall close.  That was odd, she thought.  She didn't see anybody go inside.  And there certainly wouldn't still be someone in there this late in the afternoon.  She shrugged it off and got the things she needed.  She closed the locker, put the lock back on, and walked towards the locker room.  She reached the door and grabbed the handle, opening it wide.  She was amazed by what she saw.<br />
<br />
Standing inside facing the door, waiting for her to come in, were her five worst enemies: Jennifer, Trish, Liz, Jamie and Kylie.  They appeared to have been waiting for her to show up.  But what truly amazed her, in the sense of not knowing what the hell was going on, was that all five of them were naked.  Not one of them was wearing one shred of clothes, and none of them seemed concerned about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are the five of you doing?&quot; Miranda demanded.  The five girls began to walk closer towards her.  She noticed this but did not run out of the door.  Jennifer began speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda, we've been foes for a good long time.  My friends here convinced me that it was time to bury the hatchet, so to speak.  So I thought we should show our appreciation for all your years of being one tough bitch.&quot;  Miranda did not know what to make of this.  &quot;I have no clue what you're talking about.&quot;  She was becoming worried, as the girls inched closer to her, all with seductive looks on their faces.  She didn't know if she would be able to resist this.<br />
<br />
Jennifer continued.  &quot;Miranda, dear,&quot; she said coyly, &quot;we all know that you're bi.  Some of your friends told us what you had them do once or twice.  So we decided that would be the best way to thank you, by giving you what you desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls were now surrounding her.  Trish loosened the belt buckle she was wearing.  Jamie and Kylie were pulling her shirt tails out of her pants.  Liz started to untie her shoes.  Miranda tried to deny what Jennifer had just said, &quot;I'm n-not bi.&quot;  She was getting uncomfortable.  She tried to push the other girls away, but could not.  She was getting turned on.  Miranda continued to plead, &quot;So j-just get away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to run away.  However Liz was now lifting her right foot off the ground in order to remove her sock and shoe.  Then she did so with her left foot.  Miranda also found herself unable to run because Trish had undone her belt and began to take her pants off.  Kylie and Jamie had begun to lift her shirt up her body as well.<br />
<br />
Jennifer reassured Miranda.  &quot;Miranda, don't be ashamed.  Why, just today I found out that my friends Jamie and Kylie are going to be full-blown lesbian lovers with each other.&quot;  Miranda glanced at them, seeing that they nodded as they lifted her arms up, removing her shirt.  Trish slid her pants off the rest of the way, with Liz once again lifting her feet up to remove them from her legs.  &quot;And, I think we found out yesterday that Trish, Liz and I are all a little bi too.  And let's face it, with bodies like this, who wouldn't be attracted to any of us?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Miranda smiled somewhat at that thought.  She had always found them to be rather attractive.  Not as attractive as her, but--wait.  What was she thinking.  Now clad in only a thong that showed off her firm, round ass considerably, and a bra that bared a ton of cleavage, she felt as though she had lost control.  <br />
<br />
The other girls stopped removing her clothes.  She noticed them throw all of them into the trash, but found herself unable to demand why they did so.  Jennifer now walked straight up to her.  &quot;Let me make you feel good,&quot; she whispered.  She reached around Miranda's body and unfastened her bra.  She let it slip to the ground, exposing Miranda's perfect pair of breasts.  Jennifer rubbed hers, that had still not been changed back, against Miranda's set.  Miranda could feel her nipples hardening rapidly.  She felt a desire build up inside of her.  <br />
<br />
Now Jennifer bent down and slid her fingers under Miranda's thong, pulling it downwards as quickly as she could.  Miranda's body shook with anticipation.  Jennifer stood up straight again, admiring Miranda's angelic body.  She bent in to her face slowly, moving her head to the side of Miranda's.  Her mouth went to Miranda's ear and whispered, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
