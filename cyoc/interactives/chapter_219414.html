<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was an hour after the house tour that Rachael now stood on a busy street under a blood red sky. To say this was a affluent section of Dis was an understatement. The road was dirt. Buildings standing side by side made out of stone. The type of stone that implies, that buildings were carved out of solid bedrock.<br />
“I could have sworn we were in Dis,” Rachael looking concerned; “did you portal us to the town of Bedrock, Maisy?”<br />
“Haha,” Maisy quipped; “No this is Dis up close. Enoch was correct,” Maisy grabbing Rachael and leading her down the street; “It has gone slummy.”<br />
<br />
Rachael couldn’t argue; while walking down the road, she spied several male demons squatting by a the corner of a few buildings. They were defecating right there with no concern for privacy or modesty. Rachael as a human would have found such an act out in the open, disgusting and repugnant. As a demon herself; she barely batted an eye. Continuing on Rachael notice several humans in rags being whipped as they were being tasked with digging a large pit by what could be a brothel or a drug house. Rachael couldn’t be certain, but believes those humans were once alive, but are now enduring their punishment for the sins they committed. Partly curious but unable to make a firm choice; Rachael feels a slight yank as Maisy tries to get her to speed up.<br />
<br />
“Just a little farther,” Maisy commenting; “it’s one of the best shops in Dis.”<br />
“Just as long as it doesn’t reek of rotten eggs,” Rachael turning up her nose as a cart pulled by an obsidian horse with red eyes and a mane and tail of blue flame.<br />
“Nightmare steed,” Maisy remarking; “the cart had dung for farm fertilizer.”<br />
With the smell fading, Rachael turned around to look at another sight that would shock her ultra-conservative and abusive father.<br />
<br />
A large building of stone for the first floor and serval floors made of grey dry wood. It was clear that the building was on the verge of a structural collapse; but appearances were deceiving. NO, what was shocking was the fact that several male demons were dancing on and around stripper poles behind large open windows. All naked and displaying massive erections. On male demon had his face twisted in pleasure as a human slave could be seen deep throating the demons dick. The human was visibly disgusted as he was being made to swallow the demon’s spunk. A round of applause and high pitched laughter could be heard as a crowd cheered on in approval.<br />
<br />
“He deserves no sympathy,” Maisy remarked; “that man is being punished for spreading the HIV virus to a dozen sexual partners.” Maisy looking at Rachael, “while most sins such as gluttony, greed, lust and pride are looked on as harmless vices here in hell only meriting slaps on the wrist per say,” Maisy taking a moment to watch another male demon get behind the man to penetrate him analy.  “Wrath, murder and attacks on children,” Maisy looking amused as she was enjoying the show; “are dealt with harshly.”<br />
“I guess that explains your father’s garden of despots and dictators,” Rachael also observing the hedonistic display.<br />
“Father employs special treatment for those individuals,” Maisy nodding at the male demons as they bow to the cheers of their peers.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later the two naked female demons arrived at their destination. It was a building made of alabaster marble with large columns standing as guardian to the entrance. A large opening with a dyed cloth of deep indigo stood for the entrance. The building had elements of ancient Greek architecture outside; yet inside it had the look of a modern clothing boutique in a high end shopping Centre.<br />
“Lady Miasma,” a short cherub like demon speaking as Maisy and Rachael enter the store.<br />
“Just Maisy,” she responds; “I’m not here on official business.”<br />
“So no party supplies,” the demon guessing for what Lucifer’s youngest daughter came here for.<br />
“Some other time,” Maisy answering; “Clothes and accessories of official functions. Is that department still in the back?”<br />
“As always,” the demon answering; as Maisy lead Rachael to the back.<br />
<br />
Rachael couldn’t help but drag her feet and take her time on the floor. She stopped at a small table to see several dildos in various sizes and colors on display. Picking one up she is mildly surprised at how smooth the material is as well as how light it felt in her hand. Rachael thinking ‘it’s so smooth, you wouldn’t need lube.’<br />
Rachael was halfway to trying out the phallic toy when Maisy stopped her.<br />
“Plenty of toys at home,” Maisy putting the shaft down; “and they vibrate, unlike these. Now lets get you properly fitted.”<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“I’m not liking the color,” Rachael looking unamused; “it clashes with my blue scales.”<br />
The garment was a low cut peach colored skirt that barely concealed her entrance. It was also tight so movement was restricted. It wasn’t the first clothing item that Rachael rejected; the shop associate was starting to get flustered. A male demon that had the anthropomorphic body of a zebra, yet his head was that of a python. His tongue flicking in an out of sensing the frustration as he was starting to run out of ideals.<br />
<br />
But before he began to give up in despair, Maisy come running into the change room with a big grin on her face.<br />
“Try this,” She hands Rachael; “It screams you.”<br />
“Oh,” the shop associate looks on in awe as Rachael effortlessly put on the item. Standing in front of a mirror, Rachael looks and admires at the article of clothing.<br />
The garment in question was the bottom half of a bra. It held up her breasts ensuring they didn’t bounce around wildly. Yet they didn’t cover her new ample assets; instead the bra cupped her new larger funbags keeping them held up while her blue nipples and areolas were on full displayed. She looks at it on side and tries to get a look at the back; yet her wings were in the way and she couldn’t tell if the “bra” impacted them at all.<br />
“How many do you have in stock,” Maisy speaking to the store employee; “and in colors that compliment her blue scales.”<br />
“It’s a little tight on the side,” Rachael twisting and flexing; testing the fit of the half bra.<br />
“I’ll just need to take a few measurements,” the male demon responding; would you be open to a new type of fabric that changes colors depending on the light?”<br />
“I’m game,” Rachael nodding; “but I would like a few in blue that match my scales.”<br />
“I’ll have them ready then,” the male making a few notations; “will you be taking them with you or would you like them delivered?”<br />
“Delivered,” Maisy quickly jotting down her address; “now let’s look a hair and horn accessories.”<br />
“Can we also look at ear piercings,” Rachael unclasping the cup bra; “and maybe look at getting a tattoo?”<br />
“Oooooh,” Maisy grinning; “where did this sudden desire come from?”<br />
“I was a repressed girl growing up in a religiously abusive household,” Rachael following Maisy back to front of the store; “and I have lots of repressed emotions and urges to let loose.”<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************<br />
<br />
An hour later and rejecting the hair and horn accessories; Rachael and Maisy sit down at a bistro to enjoy a cool drink. Rachael sporting freshly pierced ears; Rachael opted for small studs that were made from dark blue opal framed in a thin band of gold. Accentuating the ear studs was a small nose stud; also blue opal with a thin band of gold. Maisy not one to miss out on the fun, elected to get a nipple pierce and her bellybutton also pierced. Both piercings were gold inlayed with red diamonds.<br />
“You certain about getting a tattoo,” Maisy sipping on a drink consisting of steeped tea and honey; “I hear they hurt.”<br />
“Dam straight I want to get a tattoo,” Rachael drink what tastes like a passion fruit smoothie; “more so if it will spite my father once he sees the new me.”<br />
“What are you getting on about,” Maisy looking puzzled; “your father wants to kill you. He is hiding somewhere here in hell along with a few of his cronies.&quot; Maisy and Rachael unaware that around this time Beelzebub is getting poisoned and the Iron Knights in question being whisked to heaven.<br />
“Mom and I, want him to attend our weddings. My brother’s as well”; Rachael putting down her drink. “It’s just a small bit of punishment I and mom want to inflict on him,” Rachael looking serious; “my way of saying you can no longer control me. You can no longer dictate what my role in life is.”<br />
“A racy and prominent tattoo it is then,” Maisy smiling as she goes back to her honeyed tea.</p>
