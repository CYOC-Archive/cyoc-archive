<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert looked up from his job of removing the seaweed/rope from the propeller line just in time to see Aaron and Zack come out of the water on the nearby beach. Aaron who had decided to swim to the shore because of his desperate need to use the bathroom rushed inside while Zack took a more leisurely approach heading back inside as well.<br />
<br />
“Lucky SOBs, they have girlfriends and good bodies and all the damn luck.” Complained Robert as he looked at his fat overweight self for a moment, before going back to work on the rope. As he turned back to the water, a figure was floating there looking at him. She had chocolate color skin maybe Arabic now that he thought about it with unnatural green hair.<br />
<br />
“Well, they haven’t meet a mermaid yet, so they can’t be all that lucky.” she said as Robert noticed the tail moving slightly behind her as she pulled herself a little bit onto the boat. He was too stunned to say anything before she grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him into the water. Even with his much larger amount of weight she pulled him in with ease and he went into the water with a splash.<br />
<br />
It was strange, the 1st thing that concerned him wasn’t the mermaid who had just pulled him into the water, but his cell phone which was in his shorts pocket. He sank for a moment or two before beginning to move back toward the surface only to have multiple hands grab onto him and pull him down while he felt a pain in his side like something had stabbed him.<br />
<br />
“Just relax….” Said multiple voices he recognized as his eyes began to change, they no longer burned in the salt water. He was surrounded by 5 mermaids and a merman. He recognized 4 of them, Nate, Rose, Amanda and Taylor had all become beautiful mermaids/merman. Their bodies had improved, and they seemed to be oozing sex and desire. The two other mermaids he didn’t know, one was the green mermaid who had pulled him down the other was a jet-black mermaid who looked somewhat familiar but he couldn’t place her.<br />
He never noticed in all this, that he wasn’t fighting as much, he was kicking still but more to stay above the sandy bottom then anything else. <br />
<br />
“Just relax and take a breath the drug works faster in the sea.” said the Green haired mermaid as she reached down and grabbed a knife which he had on his belt and to his embarrassment began to cut away his shirt and his shorts. He tried to fight that more then then fighting for air when he took his first breath of the sea.<br />
<br />
Water flowed into his lungs and through the new system which had grown within him he could breath it as if it was air with excess water coming out of gill slits located on his side. <br />
<br />
“What…what is happening?” inquired Robert<br />
<br />
“You are becoming a merperson like us.” Said Rose <br />
<br />
“They are real and thanks to human pollution they need more people to help repopulate, we are joining them.” Said the Dark mermaid “I am Sam by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Sam?” inquired Robert as he looked at the former jock now turned to drop dead gorgeous mermaid. <br />
<br />
“Yes, lets see what you become.” Said Sam<br />
<br />
“I hope it is a merman, I want some dick and he has a very good sized one, I hope we don’t loss it.” said Amanda which really surprised Robert as he looked down at himself. He hadn’t noticed that the green haired mermaid had cut away all his cloths and he was totally nude. He wanted to cover himself and hide himself from embarrassment, but Amanda had just said he had a large manhood and judging by the other mermaids looks maybe she was right. Still it was on a fat body.<br />
<br />
But his body was changing, he was still fat, but he felt his body shifting and changing, under that fat hard muscles began to grow at a rapid pace. He didn’t lose weight per say but the fat turned to muscle, his large arms became stronger as well as his legs. He still had a belly, but it was small belly with a lot of muscle under it, it reminded him of either an NFL line man or a Maori warrior, fat yes but able to break people with ease. <br />
<br />
He had never felt so strong, so much power, he really liked it. He was so focused on that newfound power he never noticed his legs lengthening a bit, not much compared to the other merfolk he was short. He never noticed nor care as his legs began to merge into a single limb as scales began to form. He was too focused on the new muscles and the power he now had, it felt really good and for the 1st time in his life he felt confident, like he could sleep with a woman and not get laughed at. He was fat yes but he was a strong and fit fat. His transformation finished quickly as his scales changed from flesh color to a mixture of gold and rich dark browns. <br />
<br />
“Nice.” said Amanda as she swam around the new merman, her hands running around his new body her eyes taking him in and more so his large and long manhood which was still sticking out from the slit in his tail where it would normally be. For his part he was looking at this very busty and sexy mermaid who was feeling him up.<br />
<br />
“I call dibs.” Stated Amanda as she grabbed his manhood earning a slight gasp in surprise from Robert, yes he had just become a merman, yes Amanda seamed radically different now, yes Sam was a mermaid now and she, Nate, Taylor and Rose seamed to be some kind of poly couple but none of that mattered, he had a type of body he always wanted and while different this version of Amanda really wanted to fuck him and he had never even kissed a girl before, so screw humanity in his view if this was what he got.<br />
<br />
“Alright that is another merman, do we transform the others or head out to sea?” inquired Nate as he looked toward the shoreline, he could see Zack and coming from the parking area he saw two young woman carrying shopping bags heading into the house. Everyone was now here.</p>
