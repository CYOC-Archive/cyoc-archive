<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken was in a bad mood. He got on the art teacher&#39;s bad side a bit when he was using low emission magic to do things that they expected like Calculating the area of a circle... or drawing a bowl of fruit... or drawing a bowl of fruit but stylized.<br />
&quot;Pick up a damn brush and what you crazy bitch...&quot; Ken was muttering as he paced on a rooftop as school undead &quot;I&#39;m an inch tall! and I just showed I was more artistically gifted than you when I was turning each grape into it&#39;s own universe, orange a sun, and...&quot; Seething Ken decided to go home. The school day was over and he really wasn&#39;t feeling like taking the bus or staying around here... Maybe Ken&#39;d drop out and find a group of monsters who worked on their spellcraft. <br />
Turns out despite having all sorts of spells to help maneuver in the air and not take any damage from falling a 1-inch did not mean having air superiority from someone like a Harpy. &quot;Found you~&quot; A playful voice sounded in Ken&#39;s head as in a blur some talon&#39;s grabbed onto Ken as the voice continued &quot;Need to establish the pecking order, can&#39;t have you just doing what you want in the&quot;<br />
&quot;LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot; Ken shouted, The harpy&#39;s telepathy got fuzzy as she wasn&#39;t expecting those words. <br />
&quot;No, can&#39;t just have any upstart~&quot;<br />
&quot;I Just want to live my life, Not mess with anyone. Let me go!&quot;<br />
&quot;Or what? Not like you can cast a fireball or something.&quot;<br />
Ken uttered &quot;Boing Boing&quot; and while he couldn&#39;t see it the harpy&#39;s breasts inflated a cup size or two. <br />
&quot;...Your a bit of a cheeky bastard aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Boing Boing&quot; Ken said as her lovely bits started getting larger<br />
&quot;Do that again and I&#39;ll crush you.&quot; the Harpy telepathized as her tight clothes were really starting to get uncomfortable. <br />
&quot;Boing Boing&quot; Ken said as the Harpy&#39;s Talons started to inflate with magic quite a bit. The Harpy feeling the magic on her body tried crushing Ken but her Talons had lost the density needed to even hurt Ken. &quot;Boing Boing&quot; The Harpy&#39;s torso felt a bit more bloated although she didn&#39;t feel heavier. <br />
The Harpy Telepathized &quot;Ok, stop that or I&#39;ll get someone at the base to hurt you.&quot;<br />
Ken said &quot;Drop me or your not even going to get to the base, Boing Boing.&quot; The Harpy wasn&#39;t letting go as even her feathers... her feathers... The Harpy had assumed it was merely her flesh that was getting bulky. She had been given a mission to retrieve the new monster on the block so they&#39;d be sure to establish the pecking order... She wasn&#39;t being weighed down by the inflation so she had assumed that it was merely public indecency and a humiliating appearance he was threatening her with, but... The flesh of her wings and feathers themselves were bulging and spreading out farther. The instinct magic the Harpy used for flight was channeled through the feathers, lose too many and you&#39;d go down, but... Have the power be dispersed incorrectly like they were starting to be and you&#39;d have to burn mana more inefficiently... increased air resistance and more mana needed to be used to overcome that... and her body kept getting bulkier and bulkier. &quot;Fuck you!&quot; The Harpy Telepathized as she opened her talons, but Ken just pointed as he drifted downwards. <br />
&quot;Boing Boing&quot; Ken said and started repeating as he thought &quot;Just in case your reading these thoughts... This is for messing with me.&quot; and the inflating chicken of the sky became... Not a blimp... Blimps implied hot hair and buoyancy in the air. But more like a bouncy Micky Mouse head with her torso having blimped out, and both of her wings being primary targets as well. <br />
The Harpy started tearing up as she was falling towards the ground and a number of civilians she was plummeting towards were trying to run out of the way. Harpy&#39;s in general didn&#39;t have to fear falling to their deaths. Face planting into some glass or building when doing stupid tricks yeah, but... The fear of falling to your death was still there, and the Harpy felt like she was plummeting to her death. She could feel the flight magic coursing through her wings and feathers, but they were so inaccurate and dispersed that they weren&#39;t helping. Then she made contact with the ground head first and... Her body smooshed into the pavement, and almost like a cartoon character she bounced off the ground and gained a decent amount of air... It then happened again and again as people took photos and videos while her clothes got scrapped off by enough collisions with the ground. The Harpy&#39;s face was red as she decided that she&#39;d get her revenge on that punk. As the scout for her gang she could sense magic alright... so all she&#39;d have to do is sense for people practicing their magic craft... There weren&#39;t many of them, and an issue was that while she could sense those thin strands of magic they weren&#39;t THAT noticeable... But all she&#39;d have to do was maybe ask around or look at that School he came from and then she&#39;d find him and he&#39;d be his playtoy once she had her talon right at his throat.  <br />
<br />
Ken checked his back a few times to make sure the Harpy hadn&#39;t found him, and then entered his room. He did his homework magically quickly, and checked social media and smirked as he saw some videos of the half-naked to naked blimp of a Harpy bouncing around for a good few minutes before the police came and then the &quot;Boing Boing&quot; stared wearing off and she was able to fly away...<br />
&quot;She&#39;s still active&quot; Ken muttered before his mom called him down for dinner. Ken was going to need to look up some combat spells for self defense...</p>
