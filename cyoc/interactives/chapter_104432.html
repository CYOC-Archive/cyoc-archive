<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christian-Criss went back to school to smash the stupid play the school wanted to host. Any true Greaser would know that Grease gives a bad rep to the real bad boys on the block, with overexaggerated movements and  shit load of crappy singing, who the fuck do they think they are? Sneaking in the dead of night, with a trusty crowbar to break open the locked theatre doors after night. They&#39;re gonna be teachin those posers a lesson, and make sure the auditions to never ever get started.<br />
<br />
Baron stayed up late to help put up more posters to spread awareness of the school&#39;s upcoming musical. He was a high school senior at the age of 18 and has participated in nearly every school play for the past few years and has been a lead role for majority of the plays he&#39;s in, final year before going off to college.<br />
<br />
He was of average height , just slightly below a 5ft 10, which to be honest is rather impressive for an Asian in which many like to congratulate him about it, despite majority of the other Asians that are generally about his height being buffer than he is.<br />
<br />
Currently dressed in his his daily - clothes. Wearing brown khakis and a Long sleeved blue turtle neck, with a plaided grey scarf wrapped around it. Sporting a pair of loafers , hair grown back and neatly combed at the sides after shaving at the sides a month ago, black and not dyed, as its of his Asian genes.<br />
<br />
Dedicated most of his time to performance, he had a slender-tall build with a voice more attuned to singing and projection rather than shouting and hollering after chicks. He was into guys after all...which probably explains his effeminate behaviour as---<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sissy boy! I totally owned your ass with my team last night LoL!&quot; SLAP! The leader of the bullies slapped Baron&#39;s butt indecently, it jiggling underneath the shorts due to the large amount of fat accumulated from sitting down most of the time at home. <br />
<br />
Baron blushed once again to himself, as the leader, Ion , teased him again. With his general wannabe-bro SnapBack , exceedingly tall like the rest, dressed in tight fitting jeans and sneakers, along with plain and nerdly patterned shirts of their Favourite online MOBA. Ion however, stood out as he was friendly to his former classmate despite knowing he was gay, even though the others were rather...simple minded.<br />
<br />
Some wearing glasses, some did not. Tanned and yellow skin. The other guys laughing behind him like the lackeys they were. All of them delinquents , Asian, and buffer...and taller than Baron. Korean, Japanese and or mixed blood.<br />
<br />
All of them held back a grade or two including his Chinese delinquent Friend himself, some were from the same class but majority of them were just your typical troublemakers. Dumb in academics, but still smart enough to come up with many ways to cause trouble, it&#39;s probably cause they&#39;re lazy...Asians are born intelligent after all. Some just don&#39;t use it.<br />
<br />
Baron rubbed his ass slightly as he walked towards the bathroom, leaving the posters outside as he washed his face for abit, pushing aside the bangs over his head. Blushing slightly as he made sure to carefully conceal his boner for the other troublemakers, their unity was always hot, the brothership they had too, even if they weren&#39;t smart, wishing the drama club he was in for the past few years had less of...internal drama. <br />
<br />
Looks do get you to places too, he looked fine but lacked in the altheltic aspect, as well as the sense of bad boy masculinity other guys had. They were older too, he digged older guys. Aroused, as he tried to cool himself off, before heading back--?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo boys, look at all this pansy ass shit of posters lyin&#39; over here. &quot; A heavily accented, 1950s like voice sounded from behind that door. Oh shit, the T-birds are here. STOMP! &quot;This&#39;ll teach em fags a lesson to be makin fun of our gang when we&#39;re the ones in charge around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Baron wanted to flee and hide. The gang hated anyone mocking the greaser culture or portraying it in a bad light. But what&#39;s worse is their gang leader, whom hated fags more than anything and---<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH!SHOW EM PUSSIES AND THEIR FUCKIN--?&quot; Baron&#39;s mouth hollered on its own, foul-mouthed , and overall crude unlike his normal manner of speech.<br />
<br />
He clasped them shut as he tried to move-but to no avail, his legs stayed put. Like he&#39;s determined to stand by his wards. Few tiles away from the sink, eyes staring directly at his full body reflection in front of him. <br />
<br />
His dick can be seen at full mast, completely turned on by crude words he spouted--undergoing some kind of change. Height stretching alongside his sturdy legs, with them seemingly thicker, huger and hairier as though puberty did them justice. Loafers downgrading themselves to a pair of sneakers, seemingly bigger as though his feet grew several sizes.<br />
<br />
Shorts unraveling themselves downward as they hugged his new toned legs tightly, constricting-Ly like how babes cling onto those bad boy types. Threading downward as they turned a typical unoriginal light blue as he felt his ass tighten around the sexier material, feeling all his fat melting into muscle as they POP! Domineeringly into a tight prominent bubble butt, showing off nicely in his jeans like the rest of em. &quot;Haha! That&#39;s what fuckin Basketball was good for!&quot; A quick thought shot to his head, his clasped his brain momentarily before releasing for the next change.<br />
<br />
He watched as his torso expand and strengthen underneath his turtleneck, feeling it&#39;s sleeves tighten and begin to RIIIIIIIIP! As they get bullied away into oblivion with insults and online disregard into a mere silver chain on the left arm and a watch on the right . His body sporting an iconic MOBA T-shirt he got from a convention. <br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling his years of dedication being slacked away into games and just causing trouble. Yet somehow knowing he managed to keep pretty fit due to peer pressure, as his muscles swelled underneath his shirt, pecs pushing outward abs tightening and showing off nicely how he used to be in Basketball before grades were shit and he got removed from the team, still a jock but also a slacker, full on delinquent, as a tanned yellowish Colour bathed his skin moderately.<br />
<br />
His arms reeked of cheap deodorant, less grand and expensive as though he couldn&#39;t afford it. As they stretched wonderfully, biceps pounding themselves out like when they&#39;re beating up nerds, despite being sorta a nerd himself as his fists clenched, becoming attuned to playing games and lifting weights with his gamer hands, left fingers which instinctively touch the bulge in the middle of the jeans as though it were a natural habit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! oh! Yes! Ah!&quot; He feel his identity being rippled and coming to place as he touched the sensitive spot, briefs loosening up to boxer shorts as his mind filled itself with crude and dirty fantasies of girls undressing themselves, feeling any visual of hot men reduced to wimps as they get beaten and dumped away in the trash. His dick could not tolerate any fag behaviour, why would he when girls digged him ---<br />
<br />
RING RING! Baron stared at the phone, the caller ID shifting from Cherry-Drama Leader to just &quot;Bitchy Girlfriend&quot;, Cherry was always a drama queen, but now their personalities match and flourished. He liked that about her, plus she was a year younger, and they&#39;re about to graduate the same time too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi bitch? You done yet?&quot; He crudely spoke, as his tastebuds became fully immersed in profanity and women. &quot;Aiyo always excuse excuse one la? Always stuck in that shitty theatre.&quot; <br />
<br />
He feel impatience rising, as thoughts of making out ferociously with her bombarded<br />
in his head, squeezing those jugs as he felt his head reshaping to a more masculine shape. All the nasty things they did to one another sparked a ginger orange dye into a messy combover. She was always the gal that turned him on the most.<br />
<br />
His scarf tied around his head and eyes as they hip hop and sucked away his solid intelligence, using it to solidify into a black Snapback completing that grade A douchebag look that represents him and his personality. <br />
<br />
His phone got shut off, to his annoyance. The bitch liked to do that to his asshole, blinded by rage as his scarf annoyed him further into a pair of prescription glasses. Hating them as he could not afford contacts being poor, his mind boiled and burned his inner knowledge.<br />
<br />
The final changes take place as his eyes dumb themselves as though nothing really mattered except scoring that pussy and chilling with his Bros, whether it be playing fps, pumping iron or causing trouble. He hated school, it sucked and held him back for another year, but at least he got his Bros to back him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn I&#39;m one hot morherfucker!&quot; He flexed to himself in the mirror, watching those killer biceps rise as he closed his outdated phone and swaggered out of the bathroom, it becoming run down and grimy as the school didn&#39;t receive much sponsors, especially not in terms of the performing arts. It sucked anyway, like he always told his Girlfriend despite her bitchy attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi Brotha!&quot;  He turned around and saw Ion smiling dumbly over to him, as he returned the favour. They just got out of detention after causing trouble again, shame he missed it cause he had babes to heist. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sup fuckers!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bowen gave the rest of his team the middle finger, as he cockily made his way over to crew, blending in completely as though he was another lackey, not original or different, a united Brother as he walked alongside his gang and followed his leader , like he always does.</p>
