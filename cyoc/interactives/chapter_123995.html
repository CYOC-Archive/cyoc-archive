<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat just stood there, her arms folded across her ample breasts, they having matured to her delight, and the fantasy delights of many boys at school. She acted as if resolute to remain a human female during the time she needed to keep her darn younger brother from his new desires toward doe goats and breeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you,&quot; Kat said to her goatish looking brother.<br />
<br />
Baa...naa,&quot; Dan replied, he standing there, stared at where he could smell her scent of arousal from being angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not hate, as hate leads to the dark powers and they have no kindly feelings for humans, witches or the common person. Follow their lead and expect worse than what I should do to you by changing my daughter into a doe goat.&quot; Mom said, as father standing nearby just nodded his head as to be in agreement with his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to give this situation some added thought,&quot; Kat said, as she stood there staring at her horned as horny goat buck brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing else can help save my son from his damning his future to live as does a buck goat, and permanently!&quot; Father said, as Dan turned his head to cast one wary yellow goat eye upward at a father he as then felt differently about, as trusting him to do what was best for his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Kat said with an angered tone, she stomping her foot hard to the floor. &quot; I won&#39;t become a furry goat for my dumb brother to fornicate with, whether he enjoys it or not, I won&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom just stood there and listened to her brash daughter ranting, and acting as demanding respect where she had total lack for any with her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goat urine, goat buck urine..., you remember how it did for that one fellow who accosted you one night, at Christmas two years ago, and what you did to him. You gave him a fetish for want of drinking horse urine, after he said to you, he wanted you to suck his..., well you remember what!&quot; Father said, as mom listened, but never once did she cease staring at her lovely and mean daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horse urine, drinking horse urine, what sort of curse is that?&quot; Kat blurting out her surprised wonderment as what doing of such ad anything to do with her or the situation at hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, it could do some better, as I recall that fellow grew to liking horse urine so much, he asked of me to make it as his life&#39;s delight, the tasting of stallion urine and salty flavored semen.&quot; Mom said, as she looking at Kat made her smile an evil grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t get it, Dan peed all over me, so what does his urinating have to do with this..., oh no, I remember that guy. To assure his silence for liking to drink horse urine, he became, Mom merged him with his favorite horse. You made him merge into the genitals of that black draft horse stallion. I don&#39;t recall you ever released him from being the penis of that horse..., he enjoying the flavor of stallion urine and spunk.<br />
<br />
Do I have this right, my Mom is thinking of merging her daughter to be part of the male genitals of her goat-brother? <br />
<br />
How would that work to do anything better for stopping Dan from his mating with a doe goat?&quot; Kat questioning the plans of her mother, as a daughter was becoming excited, not not from a sense of delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;You idea dear could help regulate this situation, and allow us to regain both of our children after three years of their living together.&quot; Mom said to her non-magical husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no no,&quot; Kat screamed, she showing her sense of resolve was not along the same thoughts of her parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must word the spell carefully, or lose our daughter to liking what she becomes..., the dark demons must be questioned about the wording.&quot; Mom said, as she began to comprehend what sort of spell would work the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, by Astroth and Zepar&#39;s favoring me and their aid helping me change Dan into being a Goat, I will me not to be the goat genitals of my brother..., no, no, no, as I would rather become something sexier, more female..., owe, hey what was that! Ouch, that hurt, hey Mom?&quot; Kat said, she feeling a sudden wave of pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not me daughter, you invoked the attention now of grandiose demons, and they are enveloping their control of you.&quot; Mom said, as saw her daughter&#39;s skin color begin to turn a dark sun tanned brown.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Kat seeing her skin color changing, she said, asking her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rather cocky isn&#39;t she,&quot; a booming baritone voice said to all there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan makes a fine looking buck goat, I think,&quot; so said a deep tone voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Astroth, get me out of this fix, and promise me you shall not let my mother change me, merge me with my goat brother&#39;s cock!&quot; Kat said, she getting frantic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do excuse my butting in, but your daughter dared to use our names for her good.   She is a brash teenage witch, and requires some time of maturing!&quot; The booming baritone voiced demon so said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please sir, do not doom my daughter because of her lacking experience.&quot; Mom asked, the worry in her voice both Dan and Dad heard clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be no buck goat cock for three years, I will not, will not, no, no, no!&quot; Kat stated, she as much ignoring then Astroth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Willful, isn&#39;t she, Astroth my friend!&quot; Zepar said, as he then chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish to buy your goat son and this willful young female, as they would make a lovely pair for me to use to taunt common humans.&quot; Astroth so said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks,&quot; Yelled father at the demonic offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet dear, yelling at a demon is not a good idea!&quot; Mom said as tried to warn father.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, sorry dear..., cough, hack, hack, cough, dear..., mother, oh what is this I feel happening...&quot; Father said as Kat, Mom, and his goatish son all saw the expression of a man feeling ill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bold for a foolish man,&quot; said Astroth to Zepar. &quot;Yes bold as a bull in rut!&quot; Zepar said as if to suggest an alternative lifestyle and bodily form for father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agree with my kindly offer to buy your children or learn to like your bull of a husband to mate with you rather brutal style, and with seeking the depths of your... self.&quot; Astroth restated his offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Murooo...,&quot; Father then bellowed, he mooing as would a bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make up you mind, or your husband will be chasing cows by nightfall.&quot; Zepar said, as he then took to staring at Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you please master, let my husband remain here as the man I love, and do buy then my children.&quot; Mom said, as Kat stood there with her mouth agape, as in awe of what her mother agreed to let happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Kat said as if to question what her mother agreed to allow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You brought down the wrath of two great demons to add their insight to your problem,&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;By all that is unholy, I demand you leave us in peace, go away, bother someone who would like to become a horse cock or goat cock!&quot; Kat said, she arousing the demons, they stiffened their postures.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough of this, girl, you said you would rather be something more sensual that being merged with your brothers cute pencil-thin goat cock.  You stated you lack of delight for what dea Mom did to her attacker, made him a horse cock for life. You did not show a care if your father became a Bull..., so why should we give a care for what you are or wish to be?&quot; Astroth said, as Zepar agreeing, he said the say, they speaking in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Murooo...,&quot; Father cried, as he felt his guts changing, seeing too his hand gnarled into cloven hoofs. He jerked his building bulk self with the spiked sensation as he sprouted a bovine tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a deal, I take Dan and reprieve him from being a buck goat, as revert him partially to being human, he now as a servant satyr to work for me. Zepar will take Katherine, she liking to be as something highly sexual, she shall begin with her body and mouth to become the vulva of a heifer cow. She shall revel in the flavor of bull semen for the next ten plus years!&quot; Astroth said, as Zepar chuckled.</p>
