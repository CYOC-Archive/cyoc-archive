<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the princess entered the dormitory, she spotted the four soldiers that was intended to her. As they heard the door open, they had hurried to a salute position all in a line. The captain of the guards quickly started to speak again, maybe stressed to have such a high-placed visitor.<br />
<br />
-Let me do the presentations! Here is our first unit, quite the promising one! She is our master of spears: Brynna! Don&#39;t let her appearance fool you, she can be incredible in battles!<br />
<br />
It would be normal to underestimate her indeed! Brynna is small—barely 4&#39;9&quot;—a tiny figure in comparison to the towering warriors around her. Her frame is frail, almost delicate, and she appears as if she might be easily blown away by a strong gust of wind. Her skin is fair and dotted with freckles, which only add to the youthful, fragile look that belies her incredible strength. Her hair is a mess of fiery red curls, short and wild, often falling into her eyes, adding to the chaotic nature of her appearance. Her eyes are a striking, bright orange—sharp and full of fire, a mirror of her personality. <br />
<br />
Despite her tiny size, Brynna radiates an energy that commands attention, her presence fiery and unstoppable. Her armor is lightweight, made of hardened leather and steel to allow maximum flexibility. It often looks oversized for her small frame, as if it was never truly designed for someone her size. Her spear is taller than she is, as a weapon that she wields with an unmatched ferocity.<br />
<br />
Brynna might be small in stature, but her spirit and ferocity make her a formidable opponent. She’s quick to anger and even quicker to act, with a personality that matches her weapon—sharp, focused, and dangerous. Despite her small frame, she has no shortage of confidence. She is relentless in battle, and her fiery temper means she doesn’t suffer fools gladly. While she may be hard to approach, those who earn her respect find her fiercely loyal. Her fighting style is relentless, fueled by a burning desire to compensate for her physical inferiority.<br />
<br />
Veremaya’s beauty is something that Brynna both admires and resents. It is the one thing that she feels she can never measure up to. The princess’s grace, her ethereal beauty that captivates everyone, leaves Brynna feeling small—not just in stature but in worth. Though she would never admit it aloud, Brynna harbors a secret jealousy, a feeling she tries to suppress with fiery pride and outward aggression.Her resentment toward the princess is quiet but ever-present. It isn’t that she hates Veremaya—she would never dare voice such a thing, as the royal pressure makes it clear that her duty is to protect the princess—but there is an underlying tension. <br />
<br />
-Here, we have Tarsemidal, our master of shields!<br />
<br />
-Content of seeing you again your higness.<br />
<br />
Tarsemidal is a large, imposing figure with broad shoulders and a strong frame, his face a mask of quiet grief after losing his wife. He wears heavy armor and wields a large, gleaming shield. His eyes, though green and deeply expressive, often reveal a sadness that he carries quietly.<br />
He stands proudly, but there is a palpable vulnerability in the way he holds himself. He wears the armor of a royal guard, though sometimes he seems more human than the stoic soldier he is expected to be.<br />
<br />
Tarsemidal is honorable and deeply empathetic. Despite his intimidating appearance, he has a heart of gold. He is a protector at his core, seeking solace in guarding others. His vulnerability and internal pain make him both stronger and more fragile.<br />
<br />
Tarsemidal is respectful and protective of Veremaya, seeing her not just as royalty but as a young woman who might also be struggling with her own battles. He tries to shield her from harm—both physically and emotionally—but he is often conflicted by his own emotions. Veremaya reminds him of his daughter in some ways, which adds a layer of complexity to his thoughts.<br />
<br />
-Next up, we have the... *sigh* master of bow himself, Riven.<br />
<br />
-My pleasure to finally make your acquaintance you majesty! I have heard so much of your striking appearance, but even the stars couldn&#39;t have prepared me for this sight!<br />
<br />
Riven is tall, lean, and undeniably handsome, with sharp features and blond, tousled hair. His eyes are a piercing blue, and he carries a bow that looks as if it were made just for him. He’s always impeccably dressed, his armor light and flexible, allowing him to move swiftly. A silver quiver of arrows rests at his side, and he wears a charming smile that never quite reaches his eyes.<br />
<br />
Riven is charming, confident, and often flirtatious to the point of arrogance. He loves to boast about his incredible skill with the bow and his ability to hit any target, even from impossible distances. His arrogance can be grating, but there is a certain charisma about him that makes it hard to stay mad at him for long. Beneath the bravado, he is a highly skilled and deadly soldier, and he knows how to get the job done.<br />
<br />
Riven is immediately smitten by Veremaya’s beauty, and he cannot resist trying to win her attention with his flirtations. However, unlike some others, he’s not just focused on her physical appearance—he also respects her presence and the weight of her position.<br />
<br />
-A... A pleasure indeed... Sir Riven...<br />
<br />
-Let&#39;s not forget our master of stealth, Faelan!<br />
<br />
The quiet figure at the end of the line moved slightly. Faelan is an androgynous individual with a slender, almost ethereal frame. Standing at an average height, they move with fluidity and grace, almost blending into the shadows themselves. Their skin is pale, giving them a ghostly quality, but it’s their face that leaves the most lasting impression. They have long, jet-black hair that falls loosely to their shoulders, often tucked beneath a dark, hooded cloak. But it’s the area below their eyes that makes others uneasy. The lower half of their face is concealed by a black cloth mask that covers the absence of their jaw. Where their mouth should be, there is a gaping hole, jagged and raw, as though their lower jaw was violently ripped away.<br />
<br />
The mask is not just a piece of cloth to hide their injury—it is a constant reminder of the horrific battle that took away their ability to speak. Faelan has never been able to speak since the incident, their voice lost forever in that moment of brutal violence. The hole remains, unhealed, a physical and emotional wound that they cannot bear to show. Their gray eyes are the only window to their soul, and while they’re often unreadable, there&#39;s a quiet sadness that lingers there, especially when they meet the gaze of others.<br />
<br />
They carry themselves with a quiet confidence, their movements swift and precise, a result of years of training in the shadows. Faelan never makes unnecessary noise, and their every action speaks louder than words ever could. They wear dark, form-fitting armor designed to blend into their surroundings, making them an almost invisible presence in the dim light.<br />
<br />
-And... Well I guess that leaves just me! You already know me but... here I am, the master of sword and captain of guard, Kaelitha, will also help you with your quest!<br />
<br />
Kaelitha is a tall and imposing woman in her mid-thirties, her body muscular and toned from years of sword fighting. Her skin is a warm, olive tone, contrasting with her starkly silver hair, which she keeps cut short in a practical yet elegant style. Her eyes are a deep amber, with a sharp gaze that never misses a detail. She wears a finely crafted suit of armor with intricate engravings of her past victories, the steel glinting under the sunlight. Despite her formidable appearance, there&#39;s a subtle grace in her movements that betrays her more gentler and caring side. She may offer a casual talk when walking in town, but on missions, she becomes a serious leader ready for every eventuality. <br />
<br />
Kaelitha is stoic and disciplined, a master of the sword who values professionalism above all. She commands respect not through force, but through a quiet authority that emanates from years of experience. She is fiercely loyal to the crown and has always been focused on her duty as the captain of the royal guard. However, there is an unspoken inner struggle: the moment her gaze lingers on Princess Veremaya, she feels a pang of admiration mixed with something she is unwilling to admit—something she hasn’t felt for a long time.<br />
<br />
Kaelitha feels deep emotions for the princess&#39;s grace and beauty, which she tries to suppress, as her duty always comes first. However, she finds herself distracted by Veremaya’s presence, torn between her emotions and the professional role she must uphold. It creates a subtle tension within her, a rare vulnerability she works hard to hide.<br />
<br />
-Hey... Thank you all for joining me through this quest but... I just want to be sure that you all are willing. The depths has been rumoured many things... I really want you to know the implications of this escort mission before helping me... <br />
<br />
-Don&#39;t worry princess, I already explained everything to them. They would have been a lot more if I wouldn&#39;t have mentioned the destination... These are the soldiers that accepted the quest, whatever it might include.<br />
<br />
The Veremaya took the time to look at each and one of the brave ones that decided to escort her through her noble quest. She really hopes that nothing too bad will happen to them... or to her.<br />
<br />
-Anyway! Our departure has been scheduled to be soon, so if you may...<br />
<br />
The group exited the guard barrack to advance towards their fateful destination, the ruins where everything is possible. Even if they may not show it, they are all quite stressed over entering that place, even knowing the incredible task they will be attaining. If they succeed, the whole kingdom would be saved because of their initiative. </p>
