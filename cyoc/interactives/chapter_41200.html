<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate, a 27 year old gay man recently moved to town with his boyfriend of three years, Ben, after he came into some serious money. They bought a reasonably sized, four bedroom log home located just inside roughly five heavily wooded acres. They both thought it was an ideal location and very much a dream home for them. They were surprised to find how accepting the town was of them as a couple as well. However, there was a secret desire that Nate desperately wanted ever since he was a child and now finally it was his opportunity to make it come true. He had never shared this desire with anyone, not even Ben.<br />
<br />
He was next in line and walked up to Stephen. He pulled out five one hundred dollar bills and handed them to Stephen. Stephen counted the money and placed it safely in his pocket. <br />
<br />
&quot;What can the Madame do for you tonight?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Nate looked back at the rest of the line. He couldn't help but feel a little shy. They were far enough back they couldn't hear him, not that it would matter in a few minutes anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've had a secret desire...you see, I've always wanted to be a werewolf. A real werewolf, not one of those monsters you see in the movies, but a true shapeshifter. To be able to change at any time,&quot; stated Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Madame Illusia would be happy to make your deepest desire come true,&quot; replied Stephen. He gestured Nate to step up on stage. <br />
<br />
Nate slowly walked up on stage and approached the Madame. Part of him still didn't believe this was possible, even though he had already watched her switch the ages of two people. <br />
<br />
He stood next to the Madame, and looked her over with some apprehension. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is my understanding that you wish to become a werewolf,&quot; she announced to the group. Nate started to blush a little as a couple of people gasped in the audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really now, there is no cause for that reaction. The werewolves you see in movies could not be further from the truth. They can be quite peaceful. Some cultures even looked to them to be protectors of their communities,&quot; said Madme Illusia. She then turned her attention directly to Nate. &quot;I saw you paid quite a bit of money for this, so I will grant you your request. But I request you to only use this power for good, to protect and help your fellow man, not harm them in any way. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. I would never want to use it to harm anyone,&quot; responded Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm very happy to hear that. In that case...&quot; said the Madame. She closed her eyes and waved her hands over Nate. He could feel the energy flowing from her into his body.<br />
<br />
Nate felt his heart rate quicken as a tingling raced through his body. He started to feel a tightness in his feet and quickly kicked of his shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably should have told you...your first transformation will be starting immediately. I think the audience would like to see it. I should also let you know now, that you can change either into a bi-pedal half-man, half wolf or into a full wolf form at any time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience watched with rapt fascination as changes started to slowly appear. A very dark five o'clock shadow had already appeared in his face. His eye color had slowly changed from his usual blue to a dazzling dark amber color. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, thanks,&quot; replied Nate before the full change started to happen. His canine teeth had already become significantly more pronounced. Hair on his face and all over his body was growing longer by the second. He could feel his muscles swelling and growing more pronounced. The excitement was giving Nate a strong erection. He held up his hand and watched as his fingernails grew into claws, and his hands became covered in a dark brown fur. <br />
<br />
Nate pulled off his shirt, revealing his chest and neck were covered by the same thick fur. His feet and legs began to reform, resembling a wolf's hind legs. His chest began to barrel out as his back reformed with new muscles. His palms swelled, the skin becoming rough as his fingers shrank and his hands reformed into paws, his arms becoming front legs. He fell forward onto them. He clenched his eyes shut as his face pushed out into a snout and his ears reshaped to points and migrated to the top of his head. A tail grew from his backside, quickly covering itself in matching fur. <br />
<br />
Nate opened his eyes and let out a joyful howl of approval. He lept from the stage and ran off into the night, leaving his boyfriend Ben behind.<br />
<br />
Ben stood up and watched Nate, in his new wolf form run from the tent, feeling both shocked and excited.</p>
