<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I laid June down across the sofa. The blanket started to fall away but I quickly caught it, as I did I noticed her engorged breasts. They seemed stretched and bulbous, there was a droplet of milk on the end of her nipple. I tried to ignore any urges as I wrapped her up in the blanket for the time being.<br />
<br />
“Shit, we really messed her up, didn’t we?” Kelly cursed, looking at June’s horns poking out from her fiery red hair. “I guess it could be worse, she’s still cute.”<br />
<br />
I rolled my eyes, “At least there’s that. Heaven forbid she be ugly and part cow.” Kelly scowled.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, June’s eyes fluttered open, she took a look around before sitting up, wrapped in the blanket. “Wh-where am I?” <br />
<br />
I knelt down to be at eye level with her. “Hey June, you passed out, so we brought you to Kelly’s apartment. Do you remember what happened?”<br />
<br />
June scratched her head. “I don’t think so. All I remember is the weird dream I was having. I dreamt I had won a sweepstake for a free scholarship, but then for some reason, I turned into a cow. I guess I must’ve been drunk for such a weird dream.” She let out a chuckle. <br />
<br />
I looked to Kelly, frowning. “Um…June, that wasn’t a dream.”<br />
<br />
June looked up at me, “Excuse me? How could it not be a dream?”<br />
<br />
I pulled open her blanket to expose her massive breasts, larger than they had been June’s entire life. June gasped and pulled the blanket back around herself. “Why you little perverts! Why I outta-” Then it dawned on her. The thing that wasn’t right. She opened the blanket herself this time, staring at the massive pair of breasts that sat on her chest. “I-I-I…” She stuttered, then she nervously reached a hand upward, gripping her hand around one of the horns on her head. “That’s impossible.”<br />
<br />
Time for some acting. I said to myself. “We thought the same thing. But we both saw it happen. A lot of people did. Right there in the park, you turned into a cow, then changed right back.”<br />
<br />
“How many people?” She asked nervously. “Did, did anyone film it? Oh gosh if something so horrible went viral…” Tears were in her eyes and she was starting to get choked on her words.<br />
<br />
“I wish no one was filming.” I said as if it were nothing more than wishful thinking. But Kelly and I both knew that wishful thinking had just become reality. “I think everyone was too shocked though, so maybe we’ll get lucky?”<br />
<br />
June wrapped herself in the blanket again, not wanting to see her enlarged breasts anymore. “Thanks for helping y’all. What happened was plenty of embarrassment. Wouldn’t want to make it worse by having to get home nude.”<br />
<br />
I got to my feet, “Kelly, stay with June, I’m gonna check your closet for some clothes that might fit her.”<br />
<br />
Kelly frowned, “Not to be rude, Joe, but I really don’t think I’d have any-.” I cleared my throat harshly and held up the finger with the ring on it. “Oh!” Kelly got the message. “You know what I think I do, now that you mention it. Check my closet.”<br />
<br />
I left Kelly and June alone and headed into Kelly’s room. I tried my best to remember what June had been wearing before she started changing, and wished a set of that same outfit into existence, now proportioned to her new assets.<br />
<br />
A green v-neck shirt, a pair of denim booty shorts with a hole in the backside, a large bra, and a set of pink panties appeared on the bed.<br />
<br />
It would look weird if I immediately came back with the clothes, so I stayed in Kelly’s room for a moment.<br />
<br />
I realized I’d completely forgotten about June’s dog that had run away. “I wish June’s dog was back home.” With that out of the way, I decided it was finally time to be a little more selfish with my wishes. No point having a power like this and not being the ideal male form. <br />
<br />
“I wish I had a six-pack and an athlete physique.” I announced. I lifted my shirt and watched as my awkward cross between thin and flab reshaped itself into the body any guy would dream about. My belly became a well-toned six pack, and my chest became two pronounced pecks. I got a little vertigo as I rapidly gained three inches in height. That was a lot better. All it took was a magic ring to have the body I’d always dreamed of. A thought crossed my mind I could probably give myself a woman’s body if I wanted, but I decided that would be something to play with later.<br />
<br />
I decided it had been long enough, and went back into the living room with the new set of clothes. June was wrapped in the blanket still, but not as tightly, her tail was swishing behind her. &quot;How are things?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Kelly smiled, &quot;She&#39;s doing better.&quot;<br />
<br />
June tried to give a weak smile. &quot;I just, can&#39;t believe this is real. This is what I am now.&quot; Her southern accent made her cow-like appearance that much cuter.<br />
<br />
I gave a look of sympathy. &quot;Maybe not, you changed back just as quickly as you changed. Maybe it&#39;ll undo itself fully after a day or so?&quot; I couldn&#39;t have made that true with a simple wish but, looking at how cute she looked with her horns and tail, I wasn&#39;t sure how much I wanted to. Besides, I could risk letting her on to my power in all this, something that wouldn&#39;t go well. &quot;I got you some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled for real this time. &quot;Oh thank the stars.&quot; She made to stand up, but stopped, &quot;Ah ah. No peeking Joey. Give those on to Kelly and turn around.&quot; I laughed, handing the clothes to Kelly, but instead of turning around, I silently wished that everyone would think I turned around.<br />
<br />
June seemed satisfied with that and stood up, letting the blanket fall. I saw her new form in full glory. Her skin was beautifully tanned, like she&#39;d been working outside every day of her life. Her ginger waves of hair cascaded over her horns and down across her shoulders like a waterfall, riding down the curve of her great breasts, stopping before the lockes reached her areolas. Her breasts were huge, yet perky, riding along the curves of her chest, they seemed stretched out, and they defied gravity just a little. As she stood I watched them sway, as if there was a heavy liquid inside sloshing around its container.<br />
<br />
Below her breasts, her waist pinched into an hourglass which widened into her supple and wide hips, I couldn&#39;t see behind but I could tell her ass was thick and juicy. Her tail swished behind her as she stretched, having been in the fetal position for at least twenty minutes now.  Her pussy had reduced to its normal human proportions again, no longer the thick opening of a heifer ready for breeding, it was now the tight vulva of a young woman.<br />
<br />
Her legs were long and strong, slender yet thick, the curves melding into each other to create a beautiful sight an artist could only dream of sketching. At the base sat her dainty feet, staggering under her new weight as she grew accustomed to the tits that sat upon her chest.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, there was no way I was reversing this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so off-balance with these damn things.&quot; June complained, taking the undergarments from Kelly. &quot;Not to mention, I think they&#39;re fulla milk.&quot; She whispered that last bit.<br />
<br />
Kelly smiled, &quot;Believe it or not. I&#39;ve been having the same problem recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
June pulled on the shorts, &quot;Really? What do you do for it? Can I make it, like, less?&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was when I got an idea.</p>
