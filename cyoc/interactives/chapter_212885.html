<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean woke up, and start walking towards the door. Jeff tried to follow, but immedieatly fell down. Walking on all fours was so different! He tried again, focused. Right rear foward, Than right front, left rear and left front. He repeated this patteren, becoming familiar with it. When he arrived at the door, Dean was standing there, browsing his phone. He looked down at Jeff and said: &quot;I see you&#39;re getting along. See, i&#39;ve checked my social media, my friend&#39;s list and my contacts, and you&#39;re not there. For as far as the world knows, you were my dog since your were 3 months old-look at this picture!&quot;<br />
Jeff looked at picture, and saw a cute little german shepherd puppy, which supposedly was him, held in Dean&#39;s arms. &quot;It&#39;s so cool! Thou it seems to be a little problem. You see, anywhere I looked, your name doesn&#39;t show up, you&#39;re only mentioned as &#39;dog&#39;. We should give you a name to make it all look natural. What are you saying about &#39;Lucky&#39;?&quot;<br />
Jeff barked. &quot;Seems fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;I glad you like it, Jeff-I mean, Lucky. Hey! Look! Now your new name appears here! And on your papers and everything... man-well, dog,&quot; He laughed at his own joke, &quot;This is sick!&quot;<br />
Jeff whimpered. He was suddenly very hungry. &quot;Dean, I&#39;m hungry,&quot; He barked. Dean looked down at him. &quot;Well, where can it be... Oh, it&#39;s right here!&quot; He lifted up a bowl with the name &quot;Lucky&quot; plated on it. &quot;I wonder...&quot; He looked around the kitchen, until he saw a bag full of dog food. He poured it into the bowl. &quot;Eat up, boy!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?! No way I&#39;m eating dog food!&quot; resisted Jeff. Dean looked at him in the eyes. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what you said excactly, but it seems like you don&#39;t like this idea. Just remember, J-Lucky, you&#39;re a dog now, and this is what you eat. At least give it a try, maybe you&#39;d love it.&quot;<br />
Jeff lowered his head. Being a dog was cool, but this was humiliating! He looked at the bowl, his hunger burning inside of him. &#39;Oh, what the hell,&#39; He thought, and started chewing at the food, using only his mouth. After some tries, he managed to eat a few bites. Suprisingly, the food tasted really well! He let out a happy bark, and started eating, until the bowl was finished and he wasn&#39;t hungry anymore. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m thirsty,&quot; he said. Again, Dean picked up another bowl, and poured water in it. Jeff lowered his head again, lapping at the water. When he finished, he raised his head up, looking at Dean, who watched him, smiling. Jeff growled in annoyence. Does he really have to act like that? It was hard enough anyway!<br />
Dean chuckled. &quot;Come on, boy, let&#39;s go for a walk!&quot; He picked up a collar and a leash from the floor. Jeff growled. He didn&#39;t wanted to be let out outside-naked, and on a leash! But Dean insisted. &quot;You&#39;re my dog now, Lucky. Remember that. You&#39;re not a person anymore. Dogs feel no shame walking around naked and leashed, and you shouldn&#39;t either.&quot; He tighed the collar to the leash, and placed the collar on Jeff&#39;s neck. &quot;Now we&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
He opened the door, and Jeff went out, not knowing what to feel.<br />
The ouside world was just overwhelming at first. All the noises, the scents... Jeff struggled, almost getting out of his mind. Dean sat down and started petting him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, boy, you will be alright. Just calm down.&quot;<br />
The petting really helped, and Jeff continued walking, much relaxed. They walked together, alone, for a few minutes, and then Jeff smelt a familiar scent. &quot;Hey, Dean!&quot; Shouted-well, said-Ray, Dean&#39;s and Jeff&#39;s friend from school. &quot;And hi Lucky!&quot; He said in a weird voice, petting him. &quot;Wanna come visit me tommorow? Kyle will also be there.&quot; He said. Both Dean and Jeff were shocked. Ray thought everything was normal! <br />
Dean smiled. &quot;Yeah, sure. I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t stay to chat. Walks with Lucky, you know what I mean?&quot;<br />
Ray chuckled and petted him again. Jeff couldn&#39;t help but wag his tail. &quot;Goodbye, guys!&quot;<br />
As soon as Ray left, Dean laughed. &quot;He haven&#39;t noticed a thing!&quot;<br />
Jeff barked. &quot;He sure didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
They continued their walk, until Jeff stopped and whined. Dean stopped. &quot;What is it, boy?&quot;<br />
Jeff was too embaressed to answer. He looked back in shame, his tail dropping between his legs. &quot;Oh, I see. Again, get over it. You&#39;re not Jeff the human anymore, you&#39;re Lucky the dog, and dogs do it wherever they feel like it.&quot;<br />
Jeff whined. &quot;Can you please turn around?&quot; He asked. Dean rolled his eyes. &quot;Fine, but only this time. You gotta get used to it.&quot;<br />
As he turned around, Jeff sniffed, letting his nose guide him. He reached a tree, and lifted his leg. A stream of piss went out, marking the tree. When he was done, he turned around to see Dean looking at him. He felt humiliated. How could Dean do this! He growled in anger.<br />
&quot;Stop it!&quot; Snapped Dean. &quot;It&#39;s not like you really care anyway.&quot;<br />
Jeff realised it really didn&#39;t mattered to him. He got to Dean&#39;s side and sat there on his haunches. Dean smiled. &quot;This gives me an idea... you see, in this reality, you were trained... I wonder if you can follow my commands. Down, boy!&quot;<br />
Jeff immediatly fell down. He looked up at Dean, who was grinning from ear to ear. &quot;Good boy!&quot;<br />
As far as he hated this, being called &#39;Good boy&#39; and being petted was really fun and satifying. &quot;Now, sit!&quot;<br />
Jeff sat.<br />
&quot;Heel!&quot;<br />
Jeff rised to all fours, and walked to Dean&#39;s side. &quot;Now, let&#39;s try something harder... fetch!&quot; He said, picking up a stick and throwing it away. Jeff ran after it, and picked it with his mouth. He returned to Dean and spitted the stick out of his mouth. It was fun!<br />
&quot;Turn around!&quot;<br />
And Jeff did, exposing his belly. Dean laughed and rubbed his belly, and Jeff howled in joy. It was so fun!<br />
Dean&#39;s hand accidently touched his new sheath, and he let out a whimper of shame. He rised up, feeling exposed again. It was so humiliating!<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, boy. You didn&#39;t care you were naked until now.&quot;<br />
Jeff hesitated, That&#39;s right, but... He haven&#39;t got used to it yet. <br />
Dean sighed. &quot;Fine. Let&#39;s get home, it&#39;s getting late.&quot;<br />
When they got back home, Jeff could feel the scent of another human in the house. He growled and flattened his ears, until he realised that was no strange smell at all-it was Dean&#39;s mother&#39;s scent!<br />
Dean opened the door, and his mom called at him: &quot;Where have you been?&quot;<br />
&quot;I went on a walk with Lucky.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, fine,&quot; Said his mom, petting Jeff. &quot;How was school today?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was fine. Anyway, Ray invited me tommorow to his house after school. Is it okay to bring Luvky with me?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t see why not. Well, I better go back to the kitchen, I&#39;m in mid-cooking. Lucky can stay inside for now, I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;ll be rainy tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom!&quot; Said Dean. &quot;Come on, Lucky!&quot;<br />
Jeff arrived at Dean room, and went up the bed. &quot;No!&quot; Shouted Dean. &quot;You can&#39;t go on the bed, my mom would go nuts!&quot; He whispered to Jeff. Jeff barked in annoyence, but cane down. Dean walked out of the room, and returned with a dog&#39;s blanket. Jeff crawled in it, feeling so tired. &quot;Good night,&quot; Said Dean and turned off the lights. Jeff closed his eyes, and immediatly fell asleep.</p>
