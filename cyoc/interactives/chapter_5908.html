<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin was a crude and rude man educated some thirty years ago. His dear wife Paula and the two children were his pride and joy. Eric and Stephen were now in their early teenage years but were still towing the mark set by the parents. <br />
<br />
It was Eric who broke the ice when he asked to stay a weekend at the El'ToroRanchero riding school where his classmate Susan lived. Her parents owned a ranch of several thousand acres and were very nice people to all of Susan's friends.<br />
<br />
Kevin asked, &quot;How many others are going to be there this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric muttered, &quot;Oh just me and Sue, and maybe some others!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well the fight was on about being a little to friendly on a ranch so large. Paula was mostly against it but it was Kevin who finally agreed on the hope that they would meet at church on Sunday morning.<br />
<br />
Eric was of course thrilled while his brother Stephen felt left out having to stay home alone. Kevin offered the two of them would be together as Father and Son, which seemed to quell the problem.<br />
<br />
Later that night as Paula and Kevin retired the subject came up about Eric and Susan. &quot;How can you expect that young Son of our's to stay a vigin if you let him jump into these wild outings?&quot; asked Paula who sounded a little angry.<br />
<br />
Kevin laid down rolling over to look into Paula's face. &quot;Oh don't worry about Eric he's as straight as an arrow! He know's the trouble he could get into but he'll be OK, it's that Susan I wonder about? I think she will surcome to the pangs of sex and get her wish to be mounted by some young stallion. Actually I'd wish that Eric was her stud and ended up getting married into the wealth of her family! Yea, Eric married that little filly would make a good stock for parenting, well we'll see what happens, good night Dear!&quot; Kevin rolled over in hope Paula might drop the subject.<br />
<br />
Paula was not so delighted with the situation or her Husband's comments about their son Eric. &quot;You can turn on that charm all you want Kevin Rooste, but I'm standing my ground! If that boy gets into trouble with any girl before he's of legal age I'll make your life a living Hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin sat up in bed and looked at his very angry wife. &quot;Dear, dear, your getting all worked up over nothing! I trust Eric to use his judgement in such matters, He will someday be the head stallion of the household! He knows his limits and I trust that if he marry's Susan she will respect him and love him for all she's worth. He unlike myself will have a sound home built on his dominance and not run like the house with two grown people always at war. I wish that when both our boys move out of the house to live on their own that you and I can learn to live again in harmony like.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a stallion and his mare?&quot; asked Paula.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, like I was a stallion and you were my mare, that's what I wish for to live in control and dominance like a stallion!&quot; argued Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well from what I've heard the mare tells the stallion when to come and where to go! The rest of the time the big stallion can go play with himself in some corner of the pasture. Your no great stallion! In fact as you might remember I had to collect you seed into a seringe and inject it because you were too short and did not have the staypower to shot your load home. So my old stud you are more like a pony to short to mount and not enough of where it counts to back up what you claim! Humpf!&quot; Paula leveled the playing field.<br />
<br />
Kevin was getting mad as his own sexual past was now the prime subject and not the values of Eric and his best girl. &quot;I'm a success in being the best suit lawyer in town! How dare you spout off about my medical condition and the terrible time we had getting our son Stephen born into this world. I...I am the master of this house and my want's and wishes will be carried forth as I, I see fit! You my dear will do as required and when it comes the time to have relations it will be at my desire!&quot; argued Kevin really getting bent out of shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well old Stud, and I repeat OLD! It's been a year since you pranced over here and showed me a good time. My memory is fading about what is, and how big you get. Let alone the shortness of session and an erection which is timed in seconds not minutes. I would be very pleased if I was married to a true stud, but in fact it's never been like that at all!&quot; Paula argued her passions and the lack of Kevin's ability.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm feeble and fraile when it comes to sex with my wife! I wish that just for one night you were really hot and I was the only male around. I'll take two Viagra tabs and then our families' wish will come true. You will have the stud and stallion of your erotic dreams! I..I will be the stallion mounting you my mare and for one long night of wild and passioned sex we will get the thrill be both want! I might even wish that if your the mare of my dreams as once you were I would wish and hope that our relationship would last and last!&quot; Kevin argued his case with all the gusto of a murder trial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh all right there King Largo maybe tomorrow night we can see if your the stallion you claim!&quot; stated Paula with a smile knowing she's argued the old lawyer around a circle and into her trap.<br />
<br />
&quot;King Largo?&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear he is the stallion pony at stud on El'ToroRanchero. Susan told me that her Father paid several thousand dollars for him, he's a prize winning Shetland stallion. Let's hope the Viagra can help you to be like him for a night!&quot; replied Paula.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK there hot pants I wish to be your King Largo for a one night stand and maybe for many more, if your up to it?&quot; chidded Kevin.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the bedroom door opened and Stephen stood looking into the room. &quot;If we're all done with this arguement over sex and who's got what can we get to sleep now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paula and Kevin blushed as they looked first at each other and then back to Stephen. &quot;Sorry Son we'll quit and go to sleep, good night!&quot; Kevin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice shot Kevin!&quot; said Paula with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh go to sleep hot pants!&quot; said Kevin back as he grumbled about Stephen busting in on the arguement.</p>
