<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason was your average 16 year old boy just trying to survive the common high school dread. That all changed when he received a ‘special gift’ from his strange grandmother he’d barely known on his 16th birthday. It was a journal. Jason didn’t exactly thrive about the gift knowing he barely wrote anything at all, but he was just happy that it wasn’t anything like her usual antics she pulls when she’s around the family, like trying to teach her cat to meow the song ‘stairway to heaven’. Still, Jason had no desire to write in it except the one day at school where he had dealt with a lot of stress.<br />
<br />
Jason was just leaving the cafeteria after he’d decided to skip lunch again. The lunch had never been the same since the new school president. He was so hungry he hadn’t noticed he was about to bump into his ex from freshman year Lili and his ex from sophomore year Amy. “Oh wha-“ The three of them collided in the middle of the hallway that connected the cafeteria and the library. “Hey, watch where your going, loser!” Lili yelled, knowing very well who she was talking to. Jason looked up to see the two girls getting up and brushing their clothes off. “Oh, sorry. I didn’t realize there were two pigs on the road!” He scoffed at them. “Look who’s calling who the pigs! You got grease stains all over you!” Amy pointed out as they laughed walking right passed him as he picked his stuff off the floor. “I was in auto tech!” Jason remarked and continued to walk.<br />
<br />
The two had became such great friends ever since they found out they used to date Jason. Now every time he saw them together laughing which irks him. He’d see them laughing, happier to be with each other rather than him. Lili had broken up after he accidentally dropped a vase in her house that got her in trouble by her rich parents. Amy however was a different case. She was sick of being turned down for a day to hang out when he’d do it with his friends or helped with his Dad on cars so that he could earn a car for himself. But nonetheless, the two ladies would be holding shoulders, walking down the hallway when they weren’t in class or at home. Any opportunity to harass Jason they would take in a heart beat, and this time was no exception. Jason needed a way to blow off steam right away.<br />
<br />
He opened his locker to look for his handheld game console before he realized he left it at home to charge. “Damn it! I get harassed by two bitches, and I forgot my game. Fantastic. Now I have nothing to do until-“ He then looked at the journal his grandmother gave him for his birthday a few weeks ago. He’d stuffed it in his locker and forgot about it. “You know what, maybe this will help me after all.” He took the journal out of his locker and thought about something he could write about when it hit him. Jason sat at his locker in the hallway and started writing. “Lili and Amy. What a pair of absolute pigs! They may look beautiful, but once you see their true colors, they’re just out right nasty. I could already see Lili’s ears pointing up and her nose growing into a big snout…”<br />
<br />
Lili and Amy had been hanging outside the gazebo to talk about their run in with Jason. “Unbelievable! He has the absolute nerve to call us pigs! I can’t believe we were both with that selfish prick!” Lili looked like she was about ready to blow with the shade of red her face was. “Calm down. Don’t let it get to you. I’m sure it’ll come to bite him in the ass one day.” Amy said in her calm undertone. Lili took a breath and exhaled. “I’m trying, but ever since he got me in trouble with my parents, I just couldn’t take his attitude.” She sat down under the shade which Amy. Amy looked to her to try to comfort her, but she couldn’t help but notice her ears were looking bigger… and pointer. “Lili, are you okay?” Lili’s ears suddenly grew and perked up. “Of course. Just a bit steamed is all. Why?” Lili asked. Amy was about ready to tell her when she suddenly noticed her nostrils flaring upward. This caught Amy by surprise. “Oh my god! Lili… your…”<br />
<br />
“…seeing her get fatter and fatter as a curly tail rips out her panties. I’d like to see her laughing at how ridiculous she looks like if that happened.” Jason was really enjoying himself with what he was writing. Perhaps his grandmother was more thoughtful of him than he imagined. “Amy was cool, but after her hanging out with Lili she acted sour towards me too. It was like Lili’s sweat was rubbing off on her and she became a fat hog just like her. I bet she likes the taste of her sweat. Every lick, she turns more and mor pig just like her…”<br />
<br />
Amy and others stared in horror as Lili’s face now resembled a pig with her hair lush blonde still in tact. “Amy… *snort* what’s happen- Ugh!” She struggled to talk as her body started tightening around her dress with her arms and legs getting chubby. She collapsed to the floor as her butt started ballooning out showing her panties in full view. Amy saw a lump poking out her panties as a curly pink tail shot out ripping the fabric. For some reason, Lili was starting to laugh at her situation. “Ha… ha ha… look at me… I’m a fat piggy…” Amy couldn’t believe the words that came out of Lili’s mouth. “Lili! Snap out of it! Your not a pig! Your a-“ Amy started to stare at Lili as an uncontrollable feeling took over Amy. She saw Lili sweating, and it was turning her on. Amy started to lick her lips at how the sweat made piggy Lili look so shiny. Amy grabbed Lili to turn her around with her back against the floor. “Oh… got your attention didn’t I.” Lili said wiggling her snout around. “You look so wet… I bet it tastes even better…” Amy licked across Lili’s pork face as students gathered around in sheer shock at the events happening in front of them. “Yes… Amy… lick me… clean me off like the dirty piggy I am!” With every lick Amy seemed to be putting on some pounds along with her ears and nose bulging out to look like pigs as well. She could already feel the lump a over her ass wiggling in satisfaction of the taste of Lili’s succulent fluids.<br />
<br />
Jason closed the book and sighed in relief. “That was nice. I should write in this thing more often.” Jason was about to get his books ready for history before he heard a shriek. “Jason! You gotta see this!” Jason heard his friend call Kingsley call out in a panic. “Kingsley? What’s going on?” Jason asked. “It’s Lili and Amy! They… well they…” Kingsley paused. He couldn’t exactly make out how to describe the situation. “Their what? Fucking each other in the middle of the street or something? I don’t got time for those two.” Jason looked back to his locker. “I mean… your in the ballpark with that guess.” Jason looked back at Kingsley. “Alright… you got my attention…”<br />
<br />
Jason saw Kingsley was leading him outside to the school gazebo. When he got out to take a look, Jason could swear his eyes we’re gonna pop out his head. “What the fuck!?” He said out loud in full view of two half pigs. One was wearing a pure white dress with blonde flowing hair, and the other had brown hair in a ponytail wearing a green v-neck with skinny jeans that were on the verge of shredding apart. No doubt about it, that was Lili and Amy. They looked over at Jason and squealed in delight. “Well, look who it is. *snort*” Jason said nothing. He only looked at the absolute fever dream happing in front of him. Amy stopped licking for a minute and turned to Jason. “*snort* Your right Jason… we are pigs. Was that supposed to be an insult?” The two pigified girls continue to rub against each other. Students have left to get teachers to handle the situation. Others ran off the school property at the display of madness. Jason just looked. He couldn’t look away. “I told you to come see it for yourself.” Kingsley went off to find other people to look. “Unbelievable… it… it’s just like how I… wrote it…” Jason looked at the journal he written in and back at his pig exes. “Did… did I do this…” Jason was pushed out of the way by teachers and faculty. “ Call every emergency service available! This might be contagious! Everybody step back! Go home for the rest of the day!” The principal lead students away as everyone started to head home.<br />
<br />
On the way home, Jason questioned if what happened at school was for real and if he caused it with the journal. He looked at the page he wrote in to see piece by piece was an accurate representation of what he saw. “Huh… ha… ha ha. I can’t believe it! I turned those two bitches to pigs!” Jason started laughing at the concept he created in his journal that turned to real life. “But… was it really this thing that caused it?” He looked at his journal in his hands. “Maybe is should test this some more. But how?” Jason thinks to himself as he approaches his house.</p>
