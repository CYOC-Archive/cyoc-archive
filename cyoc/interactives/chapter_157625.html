<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelly found herself in line with several other of the &#39;little people&#39; needed to keep the modern world running. <br />
<br />
The spaceships ... kinda looked like an upside down saucer. The way they opened wasn&#39;t with sort of hinge or panel. Instead, the silvery surface split open, like it remained a solid piece even as it morphed and shifted. Pleasant music played as a pink light shined within. <br />
<br />
A beam of light shot up into the sky into the much larger silver circle in orbit for each person who went in. <br />
<br />
An overweight man who threw off his chain burger shop shirt as he stepped inside. <br />
<br />
Kelly wondered if there was some sort of alien mind control making herself and everyone go along with this... Or she was as frustrated with her job ass everyone else with no sense of getting any advancement that she&#39;ll take any promise of getting any advancement. <br />
<br />
A teenage goth girl waited behind Kelly, as the door opened for Kelly.<br />
<br />
Kelly stepped inside, the pleasant music not stopping as the door sealed behind her. The pink lights began to flash in seemingly random colors. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? What&#39;s supposed to happen?&quot; <br />
<br />
The pleasant music changed slightly, but not enough that Kelly&#39;s primitive human brain could really tell the difference... so relaxing, so peaceful. <br />
<br />
The more Kelly saw the colorful lights, and the more she listened to the happy music, the more she felt at ease. She didn&#39;t have to worry about anything. Everything was fine. <br />
<br />
There was no worry what her parents would think. There was no worry about what her old boss would do to her. Nothing had would happen. She smiled peacefully. <br />
<br />
She stood up straight with her legs together and her arms at her side like a pretty doll. A blue ring of light floated down, dissolving everything Kelly was wearing from her clothes, underwear, to her ID, keys, and money... What was she going to be needing it for?<br />
<br />
A purple ring them rose up from the floor. As it rose up, Kelly&#39;s body changed. Her skin gained a more tanned feel, her figure became the kinda fictional perfection you&#39;d only see in an anime, her spine somehow support oversized maternal material that bounced in place. Her skin also lost all hair below her eyelashes, becoming utterly smooth like a doll&#39;s. She lost her nipples, belly button, among other things, looking indeed like an anime character as her eyes grew larger and more expressive, her hair turned bright pink, larger, fuller, cascading down her back. She gained tiny fangs in her mouth, her eyes became pink and feline. <br />
<br />
A pink furred cat&#39;s tail grew from her tail bone, and she could feel it as a natural part of her body. Her human ears vanished and were replaced with a pair of triangular ears on the top of her head. Her feet became digigrated, as she gained retractable claws underneath her fingernails. <br />
<br />
The Cat Girl kept smiling like she should. An indigo ring of light floated down over her. A hair band formed on her head, along with a pink ribbon around her neck and tail with a little bell on them. This was followed by a pink maid&#39;s uniform that did plenty to show off her legs and cleavage. <br />
<br />
Any advanced enough technology is indistinguishable from magic. <br />
<br />
Her serial number wasn&#39;t tagged on her body on her skin or ear some nonsense, it was tagged onto her DNA sequence itself. <br />
<br />
The Cat Girl Maid continued to stand at attention, patiently waiting for what came next. As expected, the beam of light surrounded her, and she had a feeling of being nowhere yet three places at once... Then, she was in a large white room. <br />
<br />
In front of her was another cat girl maid whose theme was white instead of pink. With other cat girl maids in front of her. <br />
<br />
They walked in identical peaceful steps. <br />
<br />
Identity and free will were illusions, social constructs, facades, means of control by those with power, and The Cat Girl Maid couldn&#39;t have felt more liberated to be free of them! She was thankful to her new employers for her free upgrade! <br />
<br />
A black colored cat girl maid materialized behind her. <br />
<br />
The cat girl maids walked as the congo line continued until the room was filled. Then a holographic display appeared of the cat girl who had appeared in the original transmission. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome sisters to your new jobs and your new lives and new identities!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tis our honor big sister!&quot; The Cat Girl Maids sang and curtsied. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have made the wisest choices of your lives. Your health, housing, and safety will all be amply provided for you. And you will all receive a 250% increase of your original wage or of minimum wage of your tribe-nation of origin in whatever precious resource is valid in your place of origin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes big sister!&quot; The Cat Girl Maids sang out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You have been refined and purified. You have been freed of your burdens. Look to your left, look to your right, the cat girl maid you see is your sister, your family. Together we are a whole. You will never be alone. You will never be judged. You will never be hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
One Cat Girl maid who had come from a sweat shop and had to dodge bullets to get inside the space ship smiled a little bit more at these words. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bask in your freedom from your old lives, your old selves. All the knowledge, mannerisms, skill, and outlook needed for your new lifetime employment had been wired directly in that old simple monkey brain of yours. We&#39;ve included an upgrade to your processing power and brain capacity while we were at it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you big sister!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As promised in our verbal contract, none of you will be expected to perform any sexual actions for your new masters, and are legally protected from such. Harming a master is authorized under this circumstance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Cat Girl Maids simply nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are now free of yours demons, your pain, your misery, and those pathological thoughts that old age and pain are needed for happiness to exist. Speak the cat girl maid motto.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a perfect and happy cat girl maid! My reason for being is to serve. I am ready to begin my eternal life of service!&quot; The Cat Girl Maids all said proudly. <br />
<br />
Chips and soda appeared on floating tables in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now help yourself to some snacks and socialize with your new sisters before your first work shift. You&#39;ll find you no longer have any need to use the toilet, and sleep is optional for your mental and emotional health thanks to our upgrades. Enjoy yourselves!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes big sister!&quot; The Cat Girl Maids said united, then began to eagerly chat among themselves. This included White, Pink, and Black, this wasn&#39;t their actual designations of course, but it was simple enough for any human who wanted to ask, easier than trying to explain numbers that humans didn&#39;t have symbols for yet. It wasn&#39;t long before the cat girl maids were all hugging. They were family after all.</p>
