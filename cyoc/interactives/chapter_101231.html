<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha after her brief phone conversation with Samantha kept her focus on the study guides that William had gotten for her from the college&#39;s Education department. She had some idea on when she&#39;d get her first shot at the tests to renew her certification, and wanted very much to do well on those tests. Many of them didn&#39;t have much that truly seemed &quot;were specific.&quot; Even the section that was supposed to be for Moon Lake specifically didn&#39;t mention weres specifically. It made some commentary on nightmares, puberty and libidos, experimentation and many behaviors that Martha had seen  hints of while she had been teaching in Minnesota with students that were likely at least mostly normal humans.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of studying, Martha figured that some of that was mostly due to the fact that many elements of being a were weren&#39;t that terribly different from being human. The main difference was that for weres, the condition was stronger and fiercer than it was for normals, and in Moon Lake that meant being more aware at the Middle School and High School levels as young weres entered puberty and began to approach the date of their first transformation. Parents might help, but the schools would have to be aware for &quot;puberty on steroids.&quot; Martha eventually guessed that some of the vagueness was simply another measure to keep Moon Lake&#39;s secret. After all, if a teacher transferred to a new district or had to move with his or her family and that study guide went with them, having something that stated, &quot;as a young werecat approaches her first transformation she will begin to have increasingly erotic dreams of herself usually with other woman if her werecat form is a full lesbian or with both a male and female if her werecat form is bisexual.&quot; That would raise some eyebrows.<br />
<br />
However, despite her dedication to passing the tests, renewing her certification, and getting a full time teaching position, preferably in Moon Lake where she was now fully part of the community, distractions did pop up. They didn&#39;t relate to the pride picnic that night. Martha was curious to meet Jen Decker, as Samantha had described her as a good friend, if from a different pride, on the phone, and that made the cat in her curious. Martha was even eager to meet the other members of the small pride she had joined. Samantha and Frances had given her the email contacts of the pride&#39;s other members, and Martha did send emails to introduce herself as a new pride member, but email was hardly face to face contact. The thing that distracted her actually related to what Melissa had told her when she had stopped by around lunch time.<br />
<br />
Nate and Eric were both her babies and she loved them both dearly. She could easily tolerate Nate becoming sexually active, as he was older, and honestly, at sixteen he was statistically at the age many teens started experimenting. The heightened libido after becoming a werewolf only assured that it would happen for her oldest son. Eric, however, was two years younger than Nate and was coming out of issues really started by bullies that didn&#39;t like that Eric enjoyed both the competition of sports and the challenge of academics leading him to withdraw within himself and associate with the side of him that hadn&#39;t given him trouble. She was greatly pleased that Julie was bringing him out of his shell and she was more than willing to thinking about an engagement party to for the two of them. But she wondered if when the time came for Julie to turn Eric into a weremerman if it would be the right time and proper.<br />
<br />
The final distraction came when he heard the door click open. She looked up to through the entryway from the dinning room to the front entryway to see Eric letting Julie come in through the front door. Julie smiled to Eric and Eric smiled back to her. He was actually so engrossed with his girlfriend, he nearly shut the front door in his brother&#39;s face. Thankfully, Nate was paying attention and held a hand out to catch the door. To Martha&#39;s surprise Alex came in right behind Nate. With that, she got from her seat and began to approach them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello everyone,&quot; Martha spoke as she approached them, and turning all eyes to her, &quot;Everyone have a good day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Alex answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mrs. Anderson,&quot; Julie said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom,&quot; Eric and Nate said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings everyone home together today?&quot; Martha asked with a polite smile, hoping she wasn&#39;t giving anything away that she knew what was coming for Eric and Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;A short dance class, actually,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;Help Eric get a better grasp on dances where he&#39;s more &quot;by himself&quot; when dancing... He then invited Julie, and at lunch... I learned that Alex isn&#39;t much a dancer... so... before our pack meeting tonight, I have a bit a class to give...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate held his arms out to gesture to his brother and his girlfriend and to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can resume the normal lessons after dinner,&quot; Eric commented with a smile. When Martha looked to him, she noticed his eyes were actually blue, nearly the exact same shade as Julie&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... you&#39;ll have the night with your father tonight,&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;A new family moved here the other day, and the mother is already a werecat and is joining my pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha was a bit hesitant with that, as she&#39;d only been for a few days, Alex and Julie had been weres all their lives; not to mention that Martha also considered Samantha and Frances the leaders of their small pride. But in the end, she stuck with it. She was a werecat. Samantha and Frances had both welcomed her to their pride and she was now a member of it. She might not be the leader, but it was still her pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha wanted to put together a picnic to welcome the new werecat, and I have a picnic meeting to attend to tonight,&quot; Martha continued her explanation. She watched as Eric looked to Julie and then looked down.<br />
<br />
Julie patted his hand, and privately figured that would give Eric some free time to get some &quot;how to&quot; tips from his father regarding sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eric said slowly.<br />
<br />
Martha watched closely and could practically see the love between the two of them. And despite her concerns, the love between them was beautiful, and she enjoyed seeing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... before Nate gets into his lesson, if you don&#39;t mind... I could I see you two dance together?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
This lead to wide eyes from both of them. Eric looked a bit nervous and Julie actually looked borderline fearful. Martha wondered what that was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve only just started learning,&quot; Eric protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in the same boat and not really good... I&#39;d step on his feet,&quot; Julie added additional protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have your parents given you any lessons?&quot; Martha asked while Nate and Alex stood by and watched the interaction quietly and politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie answered, scratching the back of her head and looking toward her fight, &quot;but I&#39;m not very good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please... humor me,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;the two of you look so good together. It&#39;d suit the romantic in me quite a bit. Everyone takes time to learn...&quot;<br />
<br />
She watched as Eric and Julie traded glances and then sighed. With a nod, Eric accepted the idea and lead Julie into the living room. While Julie walked around the room, Martha moved over to the entertainment center and double checked to make sure all the right disks were in there. She set the CD player to one of the songs that she and William had used for their lessons with Eric the previous night. Once she was ready, she turned back to the gathered group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... remember how we practiced yesterday,&quot; Martha said to Eric, &quot;and Nate, Alex... I&#39;ll ask Samantha and Frances on how they work couples slow dances when both partners are the same gender to determine who leads. I&#39;m going to guess that there is mutual agreement between the two partners... but I&#39;m not sure. That&#39;s just to make sure that you two aren&#39;t stepping on each other&#39;s toes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate and Alex both felt their cheeks redden a little at that. The two nodded as Martha turned back to Eric and Julie who carefully assumed the appropriate stances and looked into each other&#39;s eyes. After a brief moment, Eric gave a semi nervous nod to his mother who then pressed play. As a slow serenade of romantic music began to play, the two young teens began to follow through the motions of the dances that William and Martha had taught to Eric the night before. It was slow and hesitant, as both Eric and Julie tried to get comfortable with each other. A small &quot;ouch&quot; at one point did indicate that one of them had managed to catch the others foot, though Nate wasn&#39;t quite sure who.<br />
<br />
To Martha, though, the issues of Eric and Julie only just learning how to dance mattered little. Eric held her close and Martha could see that his eyes never left hers. Werecats might not be able to see one&#39;s true love the way weremers did, nor did they have the sensation of the strong life/mate bonds that werefoxes did, but she could see the pure love between them by how Eric danced with Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby boy,&quot; Martha thought to herself a proud tear going down her cheek, &quot;when your time comes to join your family in were society... may it be a romantic moment for you and Julie... may you have some cognitive knowledge of the decision... and may you always be happy... both you and Julie deserve that.&quot;</p>
