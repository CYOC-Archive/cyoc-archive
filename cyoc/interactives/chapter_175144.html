<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her sleep uneasy, she dreamed she and daddy were in a boat, fishing. She&#39;d never done this with her dad, as when he did go fishing, he usually commented that it wasn&#39;t something for a girl. Feeling a tug on the line, she set her line, leaned forward, peered over the edge of the boat and gasped.<br />
<br />
Where the water was supposed to be there was instead her class pictures, enlarged and set side by side. Gazing at them, Nancy thought that they looked like the pictures the school had taken when she was between the age of six and ten. And then, the images began to morph.<br />
<br />
Before her eyes, the round face of a girl became the angular one of a boy, whilst her hair in the photographs shortened until it was more of crew-cut. Scared by what she was seeing, Nancy leaned back and nearly jumped when, inside her head, she heard her father ask her, &quot;You get anything,&quot; and looking at her daddy, she commented, &quot;No sir. Just a false tug,&quot; before she could even stop herself, noting as she did that her voice didn&#39;t sound right and that it seemed to not come from her mouth, but more like it was in her head.<br />
<br />
As her dreamed played out, in the waking world, her body continued on with the transformation that had begun before the teenage girl had fallen asleep. The instant she saw the changing pictures, her own hair had started to shorten, whilst her face lose its round, feminine appearance. Moaning in her sleep, Nancy turned over on her side as her height gradually dropped down four foot six and her weight went from a hundred and sixteen slowly down to seventy five. Shifting in her sleep as the last of the transformation washed over her, turning her into an eleven year old boy, Nancy mumbled, &quot;No sir,&quot; as, in her dream, things shifted and she stood in the living room, her dad in his favourite recliner, asking if she had made the team.<br />
<br />
Things shifted again and she was outside. Breathing deeply the night air, she felt herself get hard. Looking down at the erection she was sporting, finding it confusing to be seeing such a thing, she sniffed the air. Looking up, she spotted a pretty girl standing a couple feet from her. Not bothered by the fact that Nancy didn&#39;t have any clothes on, the girl said something, but Nancy didn&#39;t understand. Holding out her hand, the girl dropped the strange necklace on the ground at Nancy&#39;s feet, the stepped closer. Still reaching out, she grasped Nancy&#39;s firm shaft and with her soft fingers wrapped around it, she began to stroke, stopping ever so often to tease, to fondle, the ball sack that now sat beneath the erect member. Moaning, liking what she was feeling, Nancy reached out and unsure what she should exactly do, she fumbled for a bit. Thinking there was something almost animalistic about the girl, she started to play with the buttons on the girls blouse before...<br />
<br />
With a start, Nancy awoke. Thrashing about, the odd dream still fresh in her mind, she found it weird she could feel the bottom sheet rubbing against her back. Nothing making sense, at first she couldn&#39;t figure out where she was. But then, as the dream faded, and the top sheet wrapping painfully around one of her legs, she forced herself to calm down. Fully awake, she wondered if she had for some reason taken her shirt and bra off whilst she had been asleep as she rolled over and out of bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s silly,&quot; she yawned. &quot;I don&#39;t wear those things,&quot; and stretching, she started to stumble across her room, but stopped when she realised what it was she had said.<br />
<br />
Confused, she blinked and for the first time, noted that her room was different. Where once before she had posters of boy bands and cute guys, there was now sports posters, race car posters, and images of woman in scanty bikinis. The dolls and toys she had left behind when she had grown out of them, which had been placed on a shelf as decoration, were gone, replaced by trophies and various other things. In one corner sat a small television, with a video game console hooked up. Her vanity was gone, whilst her desk was now a dark maple. The walls, once whitish-pink, where now a medium blue, whilst where there had been white carpet was now hard wood flooring. Looking down at where the carpet had used to be, Nancy stopped when she saw that all she had on was a pair of forest green lounge pants. And then she saw that her now flat chest.<br />
<br />
Scared, she back up and sat down hard on the bed, now covered with a tan sheet set instead of the pastel blue set she had put on a week or so ago. Whispering, &quot;What the hell is going on,&quot; aware for the first time of what she could feel pressed against her legs, she clapped a hand over her mouth when she heard how alien her voice sounded, then, slowly, gingerly, reached down with one hand and pulled forward on the elastic band of her pyjama bottoms.<br />
<br />
Where normally she would expect to see the thatch of public hair that covered her front, and, if the light was better, the hint of the cleft that was her vulva, Nancy gasped when she instead saw something different. Leaping to her feet, tearing at the pants, she struggled for a moment before finally getting them down. Kicking them off, she stared in horror at the dick and nuts, bare, that now hung down from the front of her groin. Whimpering, &quot;No. No. I don&#39;t have one of those,&quot; bothered by how much like a boy she sounded and looked, Nancy hesitantly reached down.<br />
<br />
Random images she thought were from her dream came back to her and as she whimpered, &quot;I&#39;m no longer Nancy. Somehow, I&#39;ve become a boy. I&#39;m Lee,&quot; she thought of the girl and what she had done and then, almost as if she was being guided, she began to tease her cock.<br />
<br />
Finding it enjoyable, even as the last vestiges of his female self was repulsed, Lee watched his dick grew hard. Not sure of what he was doing, he clumsily wrapped his fingers around his erect member, gripped too hard, loosened, then began to slowly slide his hand up and down the shaft. Liking it even more, he uttered a yip of excitement and thinking it was normal, he watched as, even as he continued to stroke himself, a sheath devolped, followed by a baculum and a bulb at the base. Fumbling after a moment, he whimpered when he lost his grip and looking at his hand, wondering what was wrong, he thought something was off as he watched his fingers shortened, his thumb shift upward, and his hand morphed into what he thought looked like a paw.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to the other changes that were going on, including his tail bone extending outward, his ears moving up to the top of his head and his nose turning black, Lee tried to ease the arousal he felt by switching to his other hand. Finding it was just as hard, as his other hand had also changed, Lee stumbled. Hearing someone outside in the hallway, and for reasons he could not understand, able to smell that it was his mom, he tried to take a couple steps, but instead fell over on his bed. Liking the way the sheets felt against his erect member, he began to rub it against them, even as he barked out, &quot;Mama? Can you come in here? I need...&quot; and losing the rest a series of noises that reminded him a dog&#39;s barking, Lee whimpered as, with a crack, his body realigned itself and his feet and hands morphed completely into a set of paws, covered in white fur.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, Sara heard her son, but didn&#39;t understand at first what he&#39;d said. Alarmed, sure that something was wrong, she rushed toward Lee&#39;s room and pushed open the door. Seeing the writhing thing on the bed, it took her a moment before she could come to terms with the fact that what she was looking at was her son. Whispering, &quot;Damn it. I thought it had skipped us,&quot; she watched as her son finished changing into, if she had to guess, an English Bull Terrrier.<br />
<br />
From behind her, she heard Franklin come out of their room and start down the hall. Quickly stepping out of the room and closing the door, even as her son began to whimper in fear, Sara took a couple calming breaths. Turning, she stopped her husband before he could enter the bathroom by calling out, &quot;I think we need to talk,&quot; and when he glanced at her, she stepped closer and, in a hushed tone, she asked, &quot;Do you remember that curse I told you my side of the family suffered from. The one my sister, Patty, got, but skipped me? The one we&#39;d hoped wouldn&#39;t effect Cassie or Lee?&quot; and when Franklin nodded, a look of disbelief on his face, Sara looked away and said, &quot;I was wrong. It skipped me, but not Lee. And, because of that, possibly not Cassie.&quot;</p>
