<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">McFarland California had been known for its high school track and cross country teams for quite awhile.  This year the new team was hoping to qualify for nationals in Track.<br />
<br />
No one doubted they could thanks to their current Captain, Carlos Ramos.<br />
<br />
He was Mexican and had dark curly brown hair in a pompadour with a fade.  He was lean and had what many would consider the perfect runners build.  He often worked out after running practice.  He was still lean but it was all defined muscle.  His ass was pretty big from all the squats after practice, he had borrow his friend’s running tights once because he had split during a race.. that he still placed top 3 in.  <br />
<br />
He had just turned 18 and was hoping to take his varsity team to victory.<br />
<br />
Personality wise he was a genuinely nice guy.  He knew how to balance his leadership duties with his role as a friend.  When he gave orders people were happy to comply.<br />
<br />
“Hey Gabe wait up!” Carlos called out to his junior teammate Gabriel who was rushing through school with his head down like usual.  <br />
<br />
“Did you decide what event your running in the next track meet?”<br />
<br />
“Oh um sorry, Uh well, coach said he’d pick for me and I haven’t checked yet.  Bye and sorry again.”<br />
<br />
Gabe was always the under confident type despite being on the varsity track team for well over a year now.  Carlos  had been working to include Gabe in more of the squads after school hangouts but just couldn’t manage to get him out of his shell.<br />
<br />
He walked into coaches room which was filled with people since the school day had just ended.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Carlos!”  A teammate called<br />
<br />
“Have you seen Gabe? He let me borrow some icy hot for my shoes and I forgot to return it, he was just here.”<br />
<br />
Hmm, that means he saw what event he was in, I wonder why he didn’t mention it?<br />
<br />
Carlos found his answer when he saw Gabe was in for the two mile run on the event sheet.  This was a big deal.  A win here guaranteed them a slot at nationals.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Hey coach, you put Gabe down for the two mile?”<br />
<br />
Coach Weathers check his clipboard. “Sounds about right.  I was looking at his races, he’s so close to breaking out of his norm but he doesn’t have the mentality.  This was my all or nothing play with him.  If he does good we got a big boost for nationals.  If he performs like usual we might not even make it.<br />
<br />
Carlos went home and tried to think about ways to help Gabe.  He looked through his old yearbook and saw a picture of him and the seniors that just graduated the year before.  <br />
<br />
What stuck out to Carlos was his old Captain, Alexander, who transferred over from another school. <br />
<br />
Alex’s family were always into old mystic stuff and Alex often attributed his sport success to “some good family remedies.”  Carlos always shrugged it off as his just a weird white people thing until Alexander’s graduation.<br />
<br />
 Carlos had never seen his friend’s “magic” but when Alex graduated he gave his trusted second in command Carlos a spell.<br />
<br />
It allowed two people to swap bodies with a set task in mind and swap back when it was completed.  He said it was to “make bets extra interesting.”   <br />
<br />
“That’s it!” Carlos thought.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I could make Gabe realize his potential by running the next race as him!  Gabe can use my body in the next race while I could give him the proof that all his body needs to win is a better mentality.”<br />
<br />
However, this plan wasn’t without risks.  He wasn’t sure if the spell was even real.  Plus the race was only a few days away.  Him and Gabe would need to be pretty familiar with each others bodies by then, and Carlos knew Gabe was a shy guy.  Even at a chill place like running camp, Gabe always waited for all the guys to finish before daring to step foot in the showers.  <br />
<br />
Carlos just knew he had to try to get him out of shell and this was the best option.  He was certain Gabe needed a push like this to realize his potential.<br />
<br />
After practice on Monday, he asked Gabe to wait up for him after practice. <br />
<br />
It’s a good thing he did since Gabe would often leave without saying goodbye.  He had to cut the after practice chats with his teammates short in order to not stress Gabe out too much with anxiety.<br />
<br />
“Hey man how’s it going?” Carlos asked.<br />
<br />
“Fine, sorry if this is about me underperforming next race.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that!  You’re just as good as anyone here.  Don’t you think your body is up to the task?”<br />
<br />
Gabe just looked around and shook his head.  <br />
<br />
“That’s bullshit and I’ll prove it.  I got a plan to show you that your just as good as the rest of us.”<br />
<br />
Now here me out and don’t think I’m fucking with you cause I’m not.  See there’s a way me and you can turn into each other, I’ll run the next race as you and prove to you that you can do it.<br />
<br />
“Seriously? I’m used to people messing with me but I didn’t expect it from you.”<br />
<br />
“Now I know it sounds crazy but you gotta believe me, we can try it right here, right now.  No one’s around. Here you can even hold on to my phone so you know I’m not trying to trick you into looking stupid.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, I guess we can *try it*.”<br />
<br />
“Good now here’s what we gotta say.”<br />
<br />
“We just need to need this at the exact same time.  The spell needs to be tweaked depending on the situation so I put our names in.  Apparently the magic is in the words at the end.”<br />
<br />
Carlos handed Gabe a paper with the spell scribbled on it.<br />
<br />
“You ready?”<br />
<br />
“As ready as I’ll ever be I guess.”<br />
——<br />
“Gabriel Hernandez needs the help of Carlos Ramos.” The two began in unison.<br />
<br />
“Gabriel cannot believe in himself to win a race without the help of Carlos.”<br />
<br />
“Switch their bodies; Gabe will become Carlos and Carlos will become Gabe in order to achieve their goals.”<br />
<br />
“Until then they will remain bound to their new roles.<br />
<br />
“They invoke this spell for this specific chore.”<br />
<br />
“Knowing they might remain each other forever more.”<br />
<br />
“One person to another, bodies travel lightly.”<br />
<br />
“Switch their bodies and their lives ever so slightly.”<br />
<br />
“Complete the task at hand to reverse this spell.”<br />
<br />
“Until it’s done, in each other bodies you shall dwell.”<br />
___<br />
<br />
“Nothing happened. I’m sorry but I just can’t-“<br />
<br />
Just then Gabe felt an strange tingling sensation.  Like getting hit in the funny bone or when your foot falls asleep.<br />
<br />
He looked back at Carlos.  He always respected him, looked up to him sometimes even felt a bit envious of him.  Gabe always wanted to impress him his Captain.<br />
<br />
He also thought Carlos was pretty damn hot.  Gabe was Bi and hadn’t come out of the closet yet so being surround by a team of guys like his captain was always a bit overwhelming. <br />
<br />
He looked back at Carlos’s face and saw his curly hair begin to shift.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Gabe gained a few inches in height and began to fill out his uniform a bit more.<br />
<br />
 Meanwhile Carlos was shrinking right before his eyes.  He became baby smooth as his minor facial and armpit hair vanished.<br />
<br />
Gabe’s running shorts began to feel very tight has his thighs and manhood grew.  He was lucky his new ass didn’t rip them.  <br />
<br />
“Ca-Carlos it... worked?”  <br />
<br />
“Told you I wasn’t lying.”  Carlos nervously chuckled while trying to hold up his shorts.<br />
<br />
“But-but I can’t be you! I’ll only mess things up.  And you can’t stay in my body?? What if I- I mean you need to lead the team, what about the next race?  What about when we showe- you CANNOT see me naked! I could never get over the embarrassment and-“<br />
<br />
“Gabe calm down.  I knew what I was getting into with this.  I did this because I’m 100% sure we got this.  YOU got this.  And about all the privacy stuff, have you even met our team?  I’ve seen more naked dudes than I can count.”<br />
<br />
“But I’ll need to see your...”  Gabe looked down and realized the tip of Carlos’s old uncut dick was peeking out from of his now tight running shorts.  <br />
<br />
“Crap!” Gabe yelled as he attempted to pull them lower. “Sorry sorry”<br />
<br />
“Haha it’s totally fine, and stop apologizing already! Was my dick what you were so worried about?  The entire team has seen me naked, only fair you get to see it too.  Also, I give you complete free reign of my body to do whatever you want as long as you don’t get me killed.  I trust you man.”<br />
<br />
Gabe began to anxiously blush.<br />
<br />
“Now we should probably trade clothes.  You like like your about to tear open your shorts.”<br />
<br />
They both walked over to the showers.  Gabe headed towards a stall.  <br />
<br />
“You know you kinda don’t need that right now, l already know what I look like naked.”<br />
<br />
“But...” Gabe realized he couldn’t hide the inevitable.  <br />
<br />
“You can help me strip with my eyes closed if you not comfortable with me seeing your junk yet.”<br />
<br />
“No I just gotta stop making things weird, you guys hit the showers together all the time.  Let’s just change.”<br />
<br />
Gabe pulled down his pants.  Damn the team captain was hung for a lean guy.  <br />
<br />
Carlos took a quick glance at his new package.  Definitely smaller but it’s not like this was about comparing cocks.  It was about team work and winning.</p>
