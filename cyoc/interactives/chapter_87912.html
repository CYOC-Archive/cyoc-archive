<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, let’s keep on changing back.  I want more!”  Daisy decided firmly.  “I need to be more than this.”  <br />
<br />
“Anything for you dear.”  Jacob replied, jumping for joy inside at being able to keep their changing back into horses going for longer.  <br />
<br />
With that decision made Jacob turned his eyes to the road ahead, though his thoughts would drift to the increasingly-mare wife that sat beside him.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
Back at the farm the original Mrs Perth was starting to grow impatient with waiting, a hoof kicking on the carpet as she alternated between pacing and stumbling.  To help the time pass, she decided to head over to the barn and feed the horses.  Doing so might keep her mind of her annoyance at the time Mr Perth was taking to get back home.  <br />
<br />
As she passed the front door of the house, her body was now too long, too top-heavy to keep herself balanced on just her now-hind legs as she toppled over to land on her fully equine forelegs.  Only her obliviousness to her current form kept her from panic as she trotted over and entered the barn.  <br />
<br />
Which was the precise moment that she stopped, looked at herself, and finally realised what had happened.  She was in the body of a horse!  And for the past half hour or so, had paid no attention to this blatantly obvious fact!  <br />
<br />
A whinny-like scream tore out of her throat as she bucked and kicked, running around the barn in a panic.  Nearby, one looked at her, a pained expression could be made out in his eyes.  The original Mr Perth, only able to look on in sorrow as he guessed that this panicking horse used to be his wife.  Neither of them able to tell each other what was wrong, to comfort each other, or even share a bed together.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
Along the road to the Cabin, the ones responsible ate up the miles, thinking only of each other at this point in time, and what they would do once they arrived.  Now that they had crossed one-third of the distance to the Cabin, the effects of Jacobs wish started its next step.  With their clothes no longer enlarging to maintain their comfortable fit, they slowly began to tighten around their growing bodies.  Not painfully so, not yet, but enough to start to be noticed.  <br />
<br />
There was one more factor at work, having drunk a lot more than Daisy, and sooner, Jacob’s bladder was reaching the limits of what it could hold.  Had he remained completely human it may have caused him concern, but as he was his reaction was very simple.  <br />
<br />
He felt the dull ache of the pressure fade away, as the front of his denim dungarees became dark above the waistline, that very darkening working its way down between his legs and forming a wet puddle in his seat.  It took a while to get the sheer volume out, but once he was done relieving himself he gave out a sigh as some of the urine spilled over the seat front to drip onto the floor, and the outline of his thick shaft pressed out against the wet denim, pointing upwards.  <br />
<br />
Had they been human the act would have at best left them worried, but with their simplifying minds, it didn’t even raise a comment.  Even as the smell reached up to their flared nostrils.  <br />
<br />
It was at this time that they finally encountered another vehicle on the road, and as they passed on another, they saw the look of shock could be made out on the other drivers face as he passed them.  <br />
<br />
“So?  What to we do with that one?”  Daisy asked with a slight concern at being spotted as they were.  <br />
<br />
“Do what?  If he tells, who’s going to believe him?”  Jacob reassured her.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah,”  Daisy thought, “I suppose you’re right.”  She added as she leaned back into the backrest, their seats a little wider than before to keep holding them in some comfort, even as their clothes slowly constricted around them.  <br />
<br />
This relaxed driving continued for some time, before a glance at the milometer told Jacob that they’d reached their next important point.  <br />
<br />
“By distance, that’s us halfway there now dear.”  He said as he looked at Daisy noting how much more beautiful she was becoming to him, and how her own cream turtleneck sweater and light-blue denim dungarees were beginning to dig into her, the faint outlines of her still-human breasts pressing out against their material prisons.  <br />
<br />
He too, was showing in one way.  His slowly increasing lust for her was causing him to sport quite the erection that rose up inside his denim dungarees, a darker shade than hers, and darker still where the liquid waste clung on as thin lines revealed where the stress on it was starting to show.  His hands too, were a little different now, a thin coating of dark-grey fur but the tips of the still-dexterous fingers and opposable thumbs were hard with hoof material.  With Daisy in a near-identical position, they had made have the reversion back into their old equine forms.  <br />
<br />
“So how much longer now?”  Daisy felt the need to ask, wondering how much longer it would take.  <br />
<br />
“It’s taken us about two-and-three-quarter hours to get here, with another half-hour to the turn-off, and after that, another three-and-a-half hours of driving.”  <br />
<br />
“Four hours?”  She worked out.  “Man…”  She leaned back again, this time working the controls to let her seat slide back and lower the backrest down.  <br />
<br />
“I know it’s a while yet dear, but when we get there, we’ll be having all the fun we can take.”  He promised her.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, just gotta hold out until then I suppose.”  Daisy acknowledged.  <br />
<br />
“So the next issue.”  Jacob moved the topic forwards.  “Are you happy like this?  Or do you wish to take it further still?”  <br />
<br />
Had they known about the reversions effect on their minds, and how it was making their more primal elements more dominant, if still with human intellect, they would have since halted it, but the desire to keep going was stronger than ever now, and if they kept it up, they’d probably be unable, or more likely unwilling, to let it stop.</p>
