<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish you were as small as you&#39;ve made Tom feel!&quot; Bill roared in anger, and with a flash of light that resembled a green lightning strike, the entire world changed. <br />
<br />
Due to the damaged gemstone, the magic was unable to target Gloria, and instead released it&#39;s magic across the entire spectrum of reality in an instant. The light from the flash of blinded Bill momentarily, and he rubbed his eyes for a moment before the stinging afterimage of the world as he once knew it faded away as the new world swelled into focus.<br />
<br />
He could immediately tell something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Bill blinked the last remnants of the magical flash away, his vision slowly returning, and when it did he was filled with patty glee as he saw the tiny form of Gloria Vanapolous staring up at the world around her. Her face was too small to be seen from this distance but Bill was certain from the low shrill sound that she was screaming in sheer terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh&quot; Bill chuckled to himself as he took a step towards Gloria&#39;s form, careful not to step on the horrible teenage diva, but close enough and with enough force that his footfall caused the shrunken Vanapolous to tumble backwards from the impact. Bill&#39;s face broke into a toothy smile as he crouched down to stare at Gloria, who simply froze under his gaze. From this close vantage point Bill could see Gloria&#39;s face clear as day, the slight red spot where he had slapped her, now nothing more than a deep pink dot, and the expertly applied makeup, and the trails left in it as tears flowed out of Gloria&#39;s eyes. Bill felt the sudden urge to pick her up and extended a hand, which must have appeared the be the size of a building to the shrunken girl, who simply screamed again in her tiny little voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Tammy!&quot; Bill said, and Gloria&#39;s miniscule hands shot up over her ears as her tiny face scrunched tight in pain, &quot;Come here, you&#39;ve got to see this!&quot; The teenager was thrilled to see what his best friend turned wife turned...whatever Tammy was to him would say about the three inch tall Gloria; after all, this tiny, cowering little person in front of him had tortured Tom for years now. But when the expected response never came, Bill looked up, confused.<br />
<br />
There, in the spot where Tammy had been standing in the hallway, was a tiny woman frantically waving her arms in the air at Bill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, Tammy?&quot; Bill said, his excitement vanishing entirely to a suddenly rising wave of fear and concern. He gave the tiny Gloria, who was currently flipping him the bird, one last look before leaning back on his knees and taking a few half-crawls towards Tammy&#39;s frantic form, the kinetic force of his legs moving sending both girls toppling over once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Bill said as he crouched towards Tammy, and the small girl covered her ears much like Gloria had and giving him a pained, annoyed look. Bill gave his tiny friend an apologetic shrug and slowly stretched out his right hand toward Tammy, who eyed it cautiously as Bill lowered it to the carpeted floor in front of her. Bill watched in amazement as Tammy, like a skittish cat, slowly reached out and touched his skin; she was so tiny her touch barely registered. With another look up at his clearly gargantuan face, Tammy put both of her tiny hands on Bill&#39;s own and pulled herself into his open palm, moving to the direct center and sitting cross legged, staring up at him with big blue eyes as he brought his girlfriend closer to his face, trying not to move his hand too fast lest she be swept off to a swift end by the momentum. Now that they seemed to be close enough for communication and BIll had ceased moving, Tammy stood and looked Bill directly in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill, what did you do!?&quot; Tammy said, her voice tiny even though it was clear to BIll she was yelling as loud as she could, &quot;Why did I change!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I don&#39;t know!&quot; Bill said careful to keep his voice soft and low, and suddenly he felt compelled to look at the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone. He brought his left had up even with his right and opened it, revealing the lifeless green stone in his palm. That was when he heard a barely audible gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill!&quot; Tammy said, he tiny eyes wide, &quot;It&#39;s broken!&quot; Tammy made her way as fast as she could across Bill&#39;s palm, heading towards his left hand, which he brought in closer, setting it next to his right hand so that Tammy could cross over and join the Stone. Even next to the small gemstone, Tammy looked incredibly small, and Bill watched as she moved her hands across the surface of the magical artifact, tracing the length of the massive crack that had spread from nearly one end of the stone to the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be why the wish changed me also!&quot; Tammy said, looked up at Bill as the color drained out of his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if the stone is broken, if breaking it made the wish go bad...How do we fix it? How do we change you back?&quot; Bill said, and Tammy simply stared at him, at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
Suddenly BIll&#39;s phone began ringing, causing the teenager to jump in surprise and almost send Tammy toppling off his hand and to the floor below before Bill raised his other hand to keep the tiny teenager from plummeting to her death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill! Be careful with me!&quot; Tammy screamed in anger, her voice straining to be heard above the shrill sound of Bill&#39;s ringtone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Bill said, and after a moment of being at a loss, he simply sat Tammy and the stone on the carpet before sliding his hand into his pocket and pulling out his cellphone, where the name &#39;Willow&quot; and a picture of his future daughter turned big sister was plastered on the screen. Suddenly filled with dread, Bill tapped the phone and held it up to his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill! Oh my God! Something happened! I&#39;m in the car but I&#39;m tiny!&quot; Came Willow&#39;s voice, clear as day and on the verge of hysterics.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh no&#39; Bill thought to himself, looking down at Tammy and the Stone, and blinking as Gloria&#39;s tiny form staggered into his field of vision, the shrunken Vanapolous bent over and wheezing from exertion; clearly not wanting to be left out of the loop Gloria had run the short yet massive distance to join Tammy next to the stone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill, help me! Call mom and dad! Or 911! Come get me!&quot; Willow cried out over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, right. Yes I will, I&#39;ll come get you! Be right there, bye!&quot; Bill said, and despite Willow&#39;s frantic cries to not hang up, Bill ended the call out of habit and slid the the phone back into his pocket before looking down at the little women in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, Willow got shrunk as well&quot; He said, and he watched as Tammy&#39;s jaw went slack as Gloria simply laid on the floor, still panting and clearly beyond caring. &quot;She&#39;s trapped in the car, I&#39;m gonna go get her and bring her back inside. But I can&#39;t leave you guys here so...&quot; Bill trailed off, ignoring the almost furious ringing of his phone as he extended another hand out towards the girls while his left hand plucked the Stone up once more.<br />
<br />
Tammy nodded, and then rolled her eyes as Gloria simply flinched and curled up into the fetal position as Bills giant hand descended towards her. Bill could see Tammy&#39;s mouth moving but he couldn&#39;t hear what she was saying, and found himself staring in surprise as Gloria&#39;s former boyfriend marched over, pulled the tiny Vanapolous up to her feet, and marched her towards Bill&#39;s palm before forcing her onto the fleshy elevator. Tammy looked at Bill as Gloria attempted to make herself into a even smaller ball in the center of Bill&#39;s hand, and pointed upwards with her index finger before quickly sitting down.<br />
<br />
Bill, despite the insanity of the morning, couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, and with the two women in his hand, he slowly stood up and made his way carefully down the stairs, each step causing Tammy and Gloria&#39;s hair to rise and fall. Despite his concern Bill couldn&#39;t help but marvel at how physics now worked for the two girls, even the slightest movements affected them wildly. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, his cellphone still blaring loudly through the empty house, Bill made a short detour into the kitchen and to the table where he deposited Tammy and Gloria onto the soft cotton of the decorative doily in the middle of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back!&quot; Bill said, and quickly dashed towards the garage door, going through it to see Willow&#39;s car, still running but no one sitting in the driver&#39;s seat. He made his way to the driver side door and, praying that it wasn&#39;t locked, pulled the handle, the door popping open with a soft clunk. There, at the back of the seat, tiny cellphone plastered to her ear and tears making her tiny face soaked, was Willow..<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god Willow, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Bill said, keeping his voice quiet as he reached in and turned the ignition off. Willow screamed...something, but Bill couldn&#39;t make it out. Instead, he crouched down once more and got close to Willow, who simply recoiled from her father turned big brother in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Willow...I, uh, think I know what happened. IT happened to Tammy and Gloria too. I&#39;ve got them in the kitchen, so I&#39;m gonna pick you up and take you to them, ok?&quot; Bill said softly, holding out his empty hand to the small woman, who nodded warily and after a few moments of hesitation, climbed up into Bill&#39;s palm. Sheltering his sister as best as he could, Bill rose, shut the car door, and made his way back to the kitchen where Tammy and Gloria were waiting.<br />
<br />
Opening the kitchen door, he saw...<br />
<br />
1.   Rob Bolstrum! And he had the girls!<br />
