“Just ignore her, hopefully she’ll get bored and leave.” He said.<br />
&#8232;Kebechet’s expression turned distraught, she used her water powers to make herself appear to be crying uncontrollably.<br />
&#8232;“Travy! You’re so mean! Is that any way to talk to your future wife?!” She pouted.<br />
&#8232;“Aren’t you worried she might attack us or our friends?” His girlfriend asked looking back at the goddess and then to Travis.<br />
&#8232;“Nah, she loves me too much to do something like that. Remember? I can tell how people feel about each other.” He answered.<br />
<br />
Stephanie looked back again and saw the blue haired girl was waving very femininely, she created a heart out of water as she giggled to herself.<br />
<br />
“That girl’s crazy.” Stephanie said as she and her Boyfriend left the back area and into the main haunted house area with everyone else. The pair were aware of the girl following their every move. <br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you tell me about her?” Stephanie asked.<br />
<br />
“Like I told her: my parents canned that idea once they met you, they already love you like a daughter.” The blonde answered and gave his girlfriend a squeeze.<br />
<br />
Her heart fluttered and her cheeks went red, <br />
<br />
“What are we going to do about her? You said she won’t attack any of our friends but she seems like a handful.” She said, bashfully trying to change the subject.<br />
<br />
Travis looked from his girlfriend and then to Kebechet with a look of uncertainty.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Steph, if anything happens with her I’ll handle it. Trust me.” He said reassuringly.<br />
<br />
——————<br />
<br />
The party was something Diana normally wouldn’t go to but she felt that she had failed her last mission. So here she was dressed in a basic ghost, bedsheet costume, with eye holes cut out showing her glasses lenses underneath, she felt ridiculous but this was the only way she could observe her targets without being identified.<br />
<br />
The group of friends were mostly split up into couples which meant that she could only keep an eye on one pair at a time, this meant she could only observe Darren and Gail. <br />
It was hard to stay focused, if this was an official mission she would have no problem doing recon all night but because she was doing this on her own she seemed to be struggling without any orders to obey. The ghost-costumes girl even went to a booth that was serving drinks and was asked if she wanted a soda or punch but rejected them and  simply asked for a bottle of water. Twice she checked her phone to see if she’d been contacted for an assignment but all she saw was her blank grey screensaver.<br />
Occasionally another student would try to strike up a conversation with her, most likely not recognizing her as they would normally barely notice her like they did during school hours. Diana exchanged basic pleasantries and they eventually move on.<br />
 As she left the table she saw a person she knew she’d never seen before. Using her phone she checked the IDs of every student and couldn’t find her. <br />
The unfamiliar girl seemed to be stalking another couple, she immediately recognized the nurse as  Stephanie but couldn’t identify the grim reaper she was with. Curious of the girl’s motives she moved in closer, the black girl lingered around them and seemed upset when the masked boy would glance at her then quickly look away. <br />
It was an unusual situation and Diana could only speculate that it was some teenage drama. Diana never bothered with friends or god for it a boyfriend, but briefly pondered what that would be like.<br />
<br />
As soon as that thought came out a sharp pain shot through her body, a memory buried deep in her subconscious emerged:<br />
In it she remembered seeing herself in a mirror, but she was different: her hair was dyed pink and she had punkish makeup and piercings. Diana watched through her own eyes as her piercings were removed, her face scrubbed of any makeup, leaving a plain blank canvas. Her pink hair was shaved so her natural brown hair could grow back and finally she was stuffed into a uniform. She remembered the crack of the headmistress’s riding crop: ready to strike any girl who showed any ounce of deviation. Every girl taught to not stand out and to obey without question, to be good, to be normal.<br />
<br />
Before the girl could focus on this hidden memory she felt another shock down her spine and Diana returned to her senses. <br />
During her episode she had lost track of the couple but was easily able to locate them by finding the blue haired girl. The three of them seemed to be arguing. Diana moved closer to hear,<br />
<br />
“…because he’s my boyfriend!” Stephanie yelled.<br />
<br />
“But I’m his wife! You’re just some bimbo who tricked him!” Kebechet yelled in response.<br />
<br />
“Oh I’M a bimbo? Coming from the ditzy manic pixie dream girl?! Besides his family called that off!” The black haired girl responded.<br />
<br />
Why don’t we let Travis decide who he wants? Well Travy?” The angel asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, you know what? You’re right, Travis tell her you choose me.” The nurse added.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, come on girls, stop fighting.” He said trying to get In between the two.<br />
<br />
The girls pushed him back and yelled at him,<br />
“Stay out of this!” Seemingly forgetting that they asked him a question.<br />
<br />
“Don’t talk to my boyfriend like that!” Stephanie barked.<br />
<br />
“No! You don’t talk to my husband like that!” The blue haired girl bit back.<br />
<br />
Just as the fight was reaching it’s climax Diana received a text from Rick requesting her location. She texted him that she was keeping an eye out at the school and responded with “don’t have too much fun(;” the brunette disliked his quip but did nothing about it as he outranked her. She went back to observing and found the three sitting on a table in the corner: Stephanie and Kebechet were pouting as they drank from the straws of their sodas, staring daggers at each other. Travis had removed his mask and had a defeated look on his face as he sat between the two girls. It appeared as if he was somehow able to calm the girls down, it was like something out of a romantic comedy anime.<br />
<br />
When this thought came to her she once again felt a pain travel up her spine, another previously unknown memory resurfacing: she looked to her left and right and saw girls dressed in the same uniform as her, each one with the same tight ponytail haircut. She felt a whack on her hands that were neatly placed on her desk, <br />
<br />
“Good girls pay attention when their betters are speaking.” Diana remembered being told by the strict headmistress, her tone harsh and unkind.<br />
<br />
Diana immediately looked back at the chalkboard, except it wasn’t a chalkboard. It was some kind of screen with flashing light and patterns.<br />
<br />
Once again the flashback subsided and she was returned to the present. More determined to gain intel, she needed to be useful, she needed intel.<br />
<br />
Diana decided to lean against a nearby building to continue watching her targets, occasionally she would glance at the other costumes students that roamed the grounds.<br />
The night continued as well as her watch.</p>
