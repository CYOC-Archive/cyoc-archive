<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a tense gathering in the old building the elder council conducted their meetings; while it was just early afternoon, it was clear several members were still not quite awake. Lance seeing Leon Talbot and Andrew Curry each chugging a coffee as fast as they could; food and drink were not permitted in the council room. He knew without having to use his enhanced sense of smell that the were-lion and were-mer representatives had a long night with their spouses; Lance having drank several cups of coffee understood what hot sex and little sleep can do to a person; regardless of their age or were-species.<br />
<br />
The werewolf who was acting as guard for today opened the doors to the room; everyone slowly trudged inside. Lance in his were-panther fursona took his seat like everyone else; surprised to see Tachibana already waiting for everyone to take their seats, she in her were-vixen fursona. Raising a paw into the air she begins to speak; “I apologize for the short notice of this meeting; but I felt it important to conduct, seeing as what could be an ominous revelation has just come to light.”<br />
“What revelation are you referring to,” Andrew Curry raising his webbed hand in the air.<br />
“It would be best if Lance would inform you all,” Tachibana leaving the center dais to take her seat.<br />
<br />
Lance knowing what this meeting is about; gets up to head to speak from the dais that Tachibana was just standing on. Looking at every were staring at him he takes a deep breath and begins to speak.<br />
“Last night my brother Benton had some medical test done to determine his state of mind. This morning as myself, and my niece Frieda both visited him and Amanda, Benton’s wife we were informed by both doctor Tora Tachibana and doctor Abigail Robinson that Benton has bi-polar disorder.”<br />
<br />
No one but Andrew Curry cringes at the revelation; this lets Lance know that beside Andrew, only he and Tachibana knew of the feral ward in the hospital sub-basement. It is at this time that Tachibana joins Lance at the center to continue to meeting.<br />
“While it may come no surprise to most of you know not what this means,” Tachibana standing next to Lance; “but a bi-polar were is extremely dangerous when not properly medicated. As the oldest were sitting on the council save our wer-mer representative Andrew Curry, both he and I know what this means.”<br />
“Care to explain then,” Leon Talbot raising his paw. “why should we be so concerned that Benton is bi-polar?”<br />
“A were that is bi-polar can go feral if not treated,” Andrew Curry shouts not even bothering to raise his hand.<br />
“Thank you Andrew,” Tachibana shouts as several member start murmuring among themselves; “before we discuss what we intend to do regarding Benton, I must inform you all what your predecessors have kept to themselves.” Tachibana waits for the council to quiet down before continuing.<br />
<br />
“In the sub-basement of Moon Lake&#39;s hospital there is a secured ward. It’s called the feral ward. This ward contains various weres that have gone feral due to various mental issues other than just bi-polar disorder. Despite our longevity and our ability to shrug off most injuries and diseases we are still just a frail and vulnerable as regular human beings when it comes to old age and mental issues. Along with bi-polar we are also susceptible to Alzheimer’s and dementia as well as mad cow disease. These illness can also make a were feral. In the event of Mad Cow, there is no hope for a cure or treatment as the prions eat away your brain.”<br />
<br />
“As for why, these ferals are locked away;” Tachibana sighing; “it was discussed decades ago that they would be kept isolated from each other and the population as a whole, in an attempt to one day cure their condition. It saddens me that your parents who once sat on this council never once informed you of this prior to your induction.”<br />
“Did Benton know of this ward,” the were-rat council member shouting.<br />
“No,” Lance speaking up; “in fact he was only told about it when doctor Tora showed him the ward, when asking if it was true that a were can go feral from bi-polar disorder.” The were-rat was about to speak up but Lance interrupts him; “Up until this morning I had no knowledge to this ward&#39;s existence. Benton only told me this morning, while my brother and I have issues; I can assure you he is not one for telling tall tales.”<br />
“I and Andrew have visited this ward many times,” Tachibana speaking up; “I can assure you it exists.&quot;<br />
“I can also vouch for Tachibana’s statement;” Andrew raising his webbed hand in the air; “my sister was once a “guest” at the aforementioned feral ward.”<br />
“Did she get better,” the werewolf representative standing up to make his voice heard.<br />
“No Bradley,” Andrew crying; “she died by repeatedly trying to bust through the bars as a doctor or orderly came by to do their rounds. Afterwards a layer of armored Plexiglas was placed behind the bars of the cells to ensure no other feral would snap their own neck after getting stuck between the bars.” Andrew getting up he leaves; too emotionally distraught to  continue.<br />
<br />
“Let’s all give Andrew a moment, this is clearly a difficult topic for him.” Tachibana raising both her paws into the air; “I ask all to remain calm. While this may be upsetting, it was thanks to the forward thinking of past council members that once sat/stood were you all once did, that allowed this issue to not expose us to the world.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone left the council room for a break; it is clear from the tone as Lila approach Lance that the mood was not good. Both heading to one of the antechambers used for sexual relief and quiet contemplation; neither option feeling right for both.<br />
“So what just happened,” Lila asking.<br />
“Tachibana dropped a bomb on the council,” Lance sighs; “she just informed them of the existence of a ward full of ferals locked away in the hospital sub-basement.”<br />
“What,” Lila asking shocked.<br />
“It’s difficult to explain,” Lance sighing; “My brother Benton is Bi-polar. He and I just found out this morning.”<br />
“How does that have any bearing to a secret ward full of ferals,” Lila asking.<br />
“Because a bi-ploar were can go feral if not properly diagnosed and treated with the usual medications to deal with Bi-polar disorder.”<br />
<br />
Lila is about to respond, but a soft gong sounds signaling that the council break was over. She kisses Lance and he walks back into the council chamber. With the door closing behind him he once again joins Tachibana at the center. Looking at a clearly distraught Andrew Curry; who most likely never shared his grief with so many present, Lance took solace that many of the council representatives were comforting him. Tachibana allowing the moment to continue for a few more minutes raises a paw to signify she is about to speak.<br />
<br />
“Now the we have all had a chance to digest the unfortunate news that all have been shared; the time has come to discuss the second half of this emergency session;” Tachibana calmly stating.<br />
“Lock Benton up,” could be heard in the back of the crowd.<br />
“We cannot do that just yet,” Tachibana states; “one he is a prominent business man, for him to disappear without a trace would bring about far to many questions and people coming here to ask them.” Tachibana continues, “Second; earlier today Benton came by my estate and told me something quiet revealing. Who here knows about prophecy dreams?”<br />
A few weres raise their paws to acknowledge what Tachibana just asked; whether they themselves had one or have heard of them, none spoke.<br />
<br />
“Benton shared with me what he dreamed after undergoing his tests,” Tachibana explaining the dream of him locked in a cell snarling at his daughter who is older and carrying a baby and the dream where he is being hunted. She also shares with them the dream that showed his Daughter giving birth to her daughter and Benton holding onto the child. What she doesn’t reveal is that Frieda, Eric and Spencer were also part of the last dream and that the three children in question have a bond that goes deeper then love.<br />
<br />
“Benton was clearly rattle and wants to be around to witness the birth of his granddaughter or grandson; which is why he came by to fulfill the edicts this council handed down on him last Thursday after he attacked my office.” Tachibana waiting for some one to interrupt but getting no rebuttal continues; “With the exception of the anger management which we are supposed to inform him as to when and where. It is my belief that Benton has made a great step to not only making amends but to maintain his mental health.”<br />
Lance choosing this moment to speak up, “While my brother can be unbearable; when I was with him this morning he was so distraught over the news that he even asked Doctor Robinson if any of the therapist she was about to recommend also dealt with anger management.” Lance looking to see the crowd of council members silent, continues; “The only name on the list was Doctor Frances Twist.”<br />
<br />
Bradley the werewolf representative raises his paw to speak up, ”are you suggesting we do nothing?”<br />
“No,” Tachibana answers; “I suggest we inform Benton that we know of his condition and instruct him to continue treatment however difficult it may be.” Tachibana drives home the point of how dangerous a feral can be; “While here in Moon Lake, we have the means to capture and contain a were if they go feral. What happens if he one day has an episode similar to last Tuesday but say in London or New York?”<br />
<br />
There was a definite murmur among the crowd of council members gathered. Leon Talbot standing up speaks; “I vote we agree to Tachibana’s suggestion of ordering Benton Knight to adhere to treatment.”<br />
“I second the vote,” Andrew Curry still rattled over sharing the tragic death of his sister; “But since Benton is a were-panther it will be Lance’s duty to hand his brother the edict that we will pass down.”<br />
<br />
Tachibana looks at the crowd; “All in favor?”<br />
A unanimous rising of paws could be seen from all the council members.<br />
“Then it is agreed,” Tachibana looking at Lance; “It’s now up to you to give your brother the news.”<br />
“As soon as someone draws up the scroll,” Lance stating; “My brother will receive the news shortly.</p>
