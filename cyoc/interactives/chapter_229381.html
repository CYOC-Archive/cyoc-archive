<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you sure you really want this?  Don&#39;t you think what you&#39;re asking for is extreme.....for a boy who&#39;s trying to escape a hopeless situation?  Child, I could offer you a million wishes so much better than what you&#39;re asking for.  You&#39;re asking to be found mentally incompetent by the government so that you can spend the rest of your life in a secret government facility that&#39;s trying to regress you mentally and possibly get you to think that you&#39;re the opposite sex.  Think about it!  You could very well be spending the rest of your life in diapers and dresses.  At the very least, you&#39;re giving up your chances of seeing the world and living an adult life......potentially making important contributions to society so that you can live out your life being, at best, treated as accurate as possible as a boy in fourth grade!  Have you seriously thought of the consequences of your wish?&quot;, Madame Illusia said thoughtfully before giving Josh a hug and wiping a tear from his eye.  Josh thought about how to respond for a minute before replying,&quot;  Yes, I&#39;ve thought about my wish.  This is really what I want!  I want to work on ending my depression.  I want to have a childhood I never got to enjoy, even if it means that I wear diapers and dresses and eat baby food for the rest of my life.  I don&#39;t want to experience the outside world anymore.  With all of the wars, school shootings, drugs, poverty, and abuse going on in the world, I don&#39;t want to deal with that needless worry and stress anymore.  I just want to be loved, respected, accepted as the person that I am now and the person I will become through my regression.  I also want to love others, treat others with kindness and empathy, and spread joy.  And as for the other students in the program, I hope that they are striving to improve their own lives and learning how to overcome fear and hatred with love and compassion.&quot;  &quot;You know, when you get to the facility, they&#39;re going to have to give you a mental and physical evaluation and you&#39;re going to have to go through surgery don&#39;t you?  At the minimum, they&#39;re going to remove your breast buds and testicles and give you estrogen shots in order to keep you looking physically like a child instead of an adult.  A child doesn&#39;t have a beard or body hair and if they don&#39;t remove your breast buds, you&#39;ll develop breasts like a woman.&quot;, Madame questioned.  &quot;That makes sense, and I agree to those conditions.&quot;, replied Josh.  &quot;Also...&quot;, Madame added, &quot;They&#39;re going to give you sex change surgery if you&#39;re to be a girl and they&#39;re going to surgically render you permanently bladder and bowel incontinent if you&#39;re to become a baby and they&#39;re also going to remove all or some of your teeth depending how young your target age is going to be.  That means if your target age is six months old or below, they&#39;re going to leave you completely toothless.  After all, babies starting on baby food or who solely rely on breast feeding or being fed infant formula from a bottle don&#39;t have teeth, now do they?&quot;  Scratching his head, Josh replied with, &quot;I understand Madame Illusia and I accept the conditions that you&#39;ve laid out for me.  I know that recovering from surgery can be painful, but I also understand that it isn&#39;t for ever.  They&#39;re only going to perform surgery on me because they understand what&#39;s best for my well being.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;ll ask you one final time, Josh.  The orderlies from the facility and you potential new home are waiting outside the tent right now as we speak.  If you consent, I&#39;ll invite them in so that you can see and get changed into your new clothes and start your new life.  However, before you receive your new clothes, you&#39;ll have to sign all of the legal documents.  I will give you one more time to opt out if you like.  All you have to do is refuse to sign those documents.  If you refuse, you&#39;ll be granted a different wish or be released to your old life.  However, if you sign those documents, your decision will be final and there will be no turning back and no way out of your decision.  Are you sure that this is the decision you want to make?&quot;, Madame cautioned.  Josh held his right hand up in the air and said the following, &quot;I understand all of what you, Madame Illusia, have told me.  Having thoroughly thought about my decision with competence, I hereby knowingly and willingly subject myself to the terms and conditions of this agreement and I hereby consent to the terms and conditions of this agreement.&quot;  Madame replied, kind of sadly, &quot;I&#39;ll give you what you ask for.  Don&#39;t worry Josh, everyone doing the experiment at the facility will treat you with dignity and kindness.  I&#39;ve decided what age and gender you will mentally become.  I chose this age and gender because I believe it&#39;s the best possible outcome for you and make you the most happy you can be.&quot;  Two men and a woman in white lab coats entered the tent and waded through the crowd and up onto the stage.  In the woman&#39;s hands were two large black shopping bags, though Josh couldn&#39;t see what was inside them.  She sat the bags down before shaking Madame&#39;s hands and then made her way back off the stage and towards Josh&#39;s parents to hand them a thick stack of papers.  Josh watched as they signed the documents.  Their eyes looked glassy and their facial expressions dull and emotionless.  Josh also noticed that the way his parents signed the documents looked rigid like their hands were being controlled by some unknown invisible force.  The woman then came back on stage giving Josh a single piece of paper to sign.  After Josh signed his entire life away, one of the male orderlies asked him to remove his clothes.  Quickly, Josh stripped out of his clothes and into his birthday suit.  He thought it was fitting thought considering that he was about to start his brand new life.  Sure enough, the male orderly took away his clothes and threw them into the trash can nearest to the stage while everyone watched.  The lady orderly had removed the first garment that was to become part of his official uniform from the bag lifted it up and shook it out.  Everyone in his group would be wearing an identical uniform like this.  Josh could clearly see the patch with the number and &quot;M&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; on it to indicate his target age in months or years.  When Josh saw the patch, it was like a weight was lifted off of his shoulders.  He knew that Madame had picked the target age and gender for him and was excited to have such a uniform and wondered what it felt like to be wearing it.  But first.....he had to deal with the fact that he was cold and naked.</p>
