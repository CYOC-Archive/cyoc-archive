<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess’s heart was in her throat, what had her mother just said? She wanted her Dad to join her? As in join her in turning into a goat? That was total madness. She had to say something. Stop this madness.<br />
<br />
“What!?” she heard her father exclaim, though anxious that him speaking was a risk, she was relieved to hear his tone implied confusion and surprise. Jess relaxed a little, perhaps letting this play out was a better call. Giving away that she was in the room, half naked, was not a good place to be.<br />
<br />
“You could join me…” Joan repeated sultrily in the centre of the room, wrapping her hand over Henry’s, pushing his fingers closed around her cock. Her skin felt silky soft, and Henry could feel the flesh pulse with every one of Joan heartbeats. Unsure if what she meant, Henry didn’t recoil. Her cock felt hot in his hand as her hand pulled and pushed his, urging motion, though he held firm. Her lips were parted as she stared up at him exhaling hard. He could still smell her cum on her breath.<br />
<br />
“Join you?” he parroted, his tone questioning. What did she mean? Join her for more sex? But that would cause more changes. Henry refused to entertain any notion that she meant anything other than she was enjoying the spark of lust that the Cabin provided.<br />
<br />
For Joan’s part, as she watched her man’s confusion, she knew full well she didn’t just mean the fun brought on by the spark of lust… Though no part of her was willing or able to say that out loud, and even admitting as much as she did had surprised herself. As she had though, that voice inside her, that deep rumbling voice, the one she imagined when she looked at the hairy man in the painting, it roared in triumph again. She could hear it now, tickling her ears, egging her on, ‘You enjoy your cock Joan’ it spoke, teasing. ‘You love your smell. Tell him you want more changes. You want to be an animal, do you not? To be mounted and bred. Admit it.’ She couldn’t contradict the voice, not completely.<br />
<br />
“To fuck.” She admitted again out loud, not answering the implicit question from Henry. She tried, again, to make him stroke her, but his hand held fast. It felt incredibly frustrating, him just holding, not stroking. To relieve the sensation Joan instead rocked forward, humping his stationary hand.<br />
<br />
Henry felt the hard veiny flesh slide through his hand. He tried to open his hand, gently, but Joan held him firm. “You want me to join you in having sex again, because you’ve been having fun?”, Henry clarified his question.<br />
<br />
Joan felt that he had tried to pull away, she wanted his hand to stay where it was. ‘You want him to mount you, breed you. Tell him Joan, tell him you want him to fuck you till you’re bleating’, the voice cajoled. She couldn’t say that, needing time to think she leaned in, giving him another long kiss. As her tongue danced her mind formed a response, as they parted she breathed. “Yeah, I’m having fun, aren’t you?”. Henry didn’t answer, how was he supposed to answer that. Sure sex was fun, normally, but how could he say that he was having fun when having sex was turning his wife into an animal?<br />
<br />
Joan noted the long pause, Henry was hesitating, “Henry, are you not having fun with me?” she asked, pointedly. Henry, dutifully replied, “I always have fun with you love”.<br />
<br />
Joan could tell it was a forced answer, she frowned. The voice demanded, ‘Why will he not join you?’ “Then why not have more fun now?”. She prodded. <br />
Henry exhaled in frustration, “You know why…”, he finally said. Joan raised an eyebrow. ‘He doesn’t like your change Joan.’<br />
<br />
She stepped back, letting her cock slide deliciously from his hand. “You said you like this?!”, she gestured over her body, cock still bobbing from the motion. <br />
<br />
“I never said anything…” Henry started, to Joan’s dismay. ‘Fuck him Joan, he doesn’t like the new you’ the voice called. She shook it off as he quickly added, “I don’t mind the changes though. I love you. But having sex again means more changes.”<br />
<br />
‘You like these changes Joan, show him’ it whispered in her ear. She did. “These aren’t so bad so far.” She gestured, cupping her crotch tits, jiggling then. “Extra breasts are great”, her hands ran to her new package, one massaging balls, the other gripping her dick “ cock and balls could be fun. And I think the hooves and tail are cute.”. She spun and bent over, wiggling her stumpy tail at Henry enticingly. ‘That’s it, present!’<br />
<br />
A blast of goaty musk hit Henry as she bent over, it set him on edge. “Joan you also stink like an animal…”<br />
<br />
Joan froze, she could tell the disgust in his voice. ‘You smell great Joan.’ She pushed it aside, rising and turning. Henry’s nose was turned up.<br />
<br />
“I stink?”, she shot back, disappointed.<br />
<br />
“Ah honey.” Henry started, “You have to admit you smell a bit. You pissed yourself earlier,” he gestured at a puddle on the hardwood. “That’s not normal behaviour.”<br />
<br />
Joan was annoyed at Henry now. He’d had no problem earlier. “You had no problem with it earlier!” she accused. Henry was taken aback. “It smelled horrible then too.” He shit back.<br />
<br />
‘You could fix that Joan, it doesn’t smell horrible to you Joan’. Instinctively she replied, “Not if you joined me, your wife, it wouldn’t.” <br />
<br />
This time there was only one interpretation. “You can’t be serious!” Henry exclaimed. Was she asking him to give up his chance of leaving.<br />
<br />
Joan’s heart sank at his tone. Henry watched his angry wife as her erection wilted.<br />
<br />
“ I think you’re right. More fun is a bad idea.” Joan said in such a way that let him know in no uncertain terms that he was the reason she didn’t want fun, not her smell. She turned and made her way to the makeshift bed.<br />
<br />
“Joan.” He started. Wanting to mend the bridge.<br />
<br />
Henry grimaced, Joan threw the blanket over herself. “Joan?” he repeated. <br />
<br />
“It’s fine Henry, you were right. Just go to bed”. Her voice was cold.<br />
<br />
‘He’s your husband. If you’re changing, he should too.’ The voice whispered in her ear as Joan lay there.</p>
