<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiffany and Princess settled down into the room they had at the PET house with some degree of comfort and ease. In some ways it was good to be back at college, and the fact that the college had put together the idea for a special fraternity/sorority building made it all the more interesting. Of course, there were the assorted paperwork that came with a lot of it, particularly with people either transferring to the fraternity/sorority or applying for membership on their own, but it wasn&#39;t too bad and did offer a fair amount of things that kept both alert and busy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to be back,&quot; Tiffany commented as she breathed in deeply, &quot;and the place here has a whole new dorm smell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... more polish than detergent,&quot; Princess quipped, remembering their Freshman year at UNLV.<br />
<br />
The dorm they&#39;d been in had been clean and wasn&#39;t too bad, but in the interior areas that had been carpeted, both Poodle Animalians could easily pick up the lingering scent of the detergents used during the summer and during lengthy breaks that were used to shampoo the carpets. It wasn&#39;t entirely a bad smell, but it was something that was distinct and something that Animalians generally preferred to avoid. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t try to keep things clean, but there was the general preference for scents that were more natural than straight Clorox.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place isn&#39;t too bad,&quot; Tiffany answered, &quot;and I&#39;m sure we can get something more of a floral scent... if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or Reilly scented,&quot; Princess teased, referring Rottweiler that Tiffany had been dating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; Tiffany shook her head, &quot;What about you... weren&#39;t you hanging out with some Corgi at the end of the Bare as You Dare Competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Princess admitted and thinking back over the summer...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Having been born a French Poodle, Princess never had the sorts of worries that Tiffany had had in adapting to Animalia&#39;s Edicts after her uplifting. She&#39;d noticed that her sister had had some issues over them and on whether or not it was okay to be with an Animalian who was an uplifted animal versus a converted human. She&#39;d tried to help Tiffany after her uplifting and the accident that lead to Tiffany&#39;s conversion and double dosing. However, there had been times where Princess really hadn&#39;t known what to do other than to be there for Tiffany. In this, she was greatly pleased that Jamie ultimately WAS able to help, as it did lead to Tiffany finding Reilly, which had also put Tiffany in a much better overall mood.<br />
<br />
Though, there were some times where Princess was at times a bit jealous and did want some gentleman&#39;s attention as it were. Many people in Animalia and Lyre had been kind to her every other Animalian. Those that had mates seemed to truly fall head over heals in love, and after Tiffany found Reilly, it seemed like Tiffany was walking down that same path toward long term happiness. Which made Princess happy for her sister, though, she would like some of the same sort of attention. Though for Princess, much of it had been more her own choices for mates was very selective. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t really chase after Simon, because Simon was a wolf, and while wolves and dogs were considered close enough in many scientific circles to be the same species, Princess wasn&#39;t particularly interested in the rougher fur that wolves had. She also wasn&#39;t particularly keen on the more wild look that Wolf Animalians had. And while there were a few domestic dog Animalians that she had met, she didn&#39;t always go for some of the uplifted dogs that had often been given fanciful names... sometimes because it reminded her of her own name, but to Princess, that was somehow different, and some of the other converted humans that had become dogs were more interested in &quot;fun&quot; than anything serious.<br />
<br />
And fun was fun, Princess had no problem with that. However, she did hope that any potential mate would be able to put together some ideas that went beyond just having fun. That had kept things pretty quiet for her with regard to formal relationships, until the Bare as You Dare Competition. Princess didn&#39;t quite feel like entering, but she was willing to go along and have some fun for the moment, which would let her be there for Tiffany. And in a way it was a fairly fun atmosphere, even with many college students, some from UNLV and some from Oregon or California also coming for the competition. In this, the music and the crowd came off as something of a party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Princess heard a soft voice speak to her.<br />
<br />
Princess turned her head and ultimately had to look down to see a Corgi Animalian standing there beside her in the crowd. He had a UNLV shirt on and a pair of cargo shorts, but appeared to be as fit as any other canine Animalian. His ears were alertly raised and he had a small but nervous smile, which she guessed meant that he was interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I join you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Princess answered politely, &quot;It&#39;s pretty packed tonight with it being the finals and all... You go to UNLV?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... my friend Stuart and I both go there,&quot; he answered, &quot;My name&#39;s Marvin... you&#39;re...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Princess,&quot; Princess shook his hand, finding him to be polite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds very regal,&quot; Marvin answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told,&quot; Princess answered with a chuckle and glancing to the stage, &quot;though... I&#39;d think once I get through college... I&#39;d think I&#39;d like to teach PE... coach volleyball. Fun stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess actually watched as Marvin&#39;s face seemed to brighten at that. It actually amused her to the point where she lost interest in what was going on stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like sports?&quot; Marvin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like volleyball,&quot; Princess answered, &quot;though... right now with most Animalians living in one place and the colleges not having the funds to fully recruit Animalians &quot;evenly,&quot; they won&#39;t let me play on the official team. But some of the games arranged just among friends have been fun. It&#39;s why I figured to major in coaching/education and then teach PE/Health and coach someone&#39;s volleyball team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think on golf?&quot; Marvin asked, &quot;that&#39;s actually a game where being Animalian wouldn&#39;t have the potential for an unfair advantage. My friend Stuart and I are pretty good... though our parents also want us to have a degree so that way if we don&#39;t make it to the PGA... we can at least do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess slowly nodded. She&#39;d thought she&#39;d seen the Corgi wandering around Lyre and Animalia from time to time, usually at the side of a Great Dane Animalian. At first, she thought they might have been a same sex couple, but a little while ago, a new member joined their little group. From what she remembered, it was a double muscled Doberman Pincer female that seemed rather sweet on the Great Dane Animalian, whom Princess guessed was Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... since meeting Cammy after we came up here to see what Animalia was all about... I think some of Stuart&#39;s long term plans have changed,&quot; Marvin commented, &quot;but he&#39;s still a great guy and a good friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re still interested in golf?&quot; Princess asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a way to relax and have fun,&quot; Marvin shrugged, &quot;and it doesn&#39;t require one to be super fit to be good at it... I mean there was a guy that was a pro golfer and did fairly well... despite being overweight and drunk most of the time... I can&#39;t remember his name, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... Marvin and Stuart?&quot; Tiffany asked, &quot;weren&#39;t they two of the competitors that lost out in the Bare as You Dare Competition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes... but I think you&#39;re thinking of a different pair with the same first names,&quot; Princess answered, &quot;The Marvin I was talking with goes to school here, and I think he and his friend also talked about switching over to PET.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably to have fun with you,&quot; Tiffany teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marvin, maybe,&quot; Princess shrugged, &quot;but he is kinda cute and adorable in a Welsh Corgi way... and he does like some sports. Dad, I think would enjoy playing golf with him... Maybe frisbee golf, if we could teach dad how to throw a frisbee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany shook her head at that. Her father did play a fair amount of golf when he could, but she doubted he&#39;d be interested in frisbee golf. She was just glad that he accepted Reilly during their meeting, along with offering ideas on things that Reilly could do.  Some related to security related work, which on the surface made sense, as Rottweilers were often used as guard, though some of the suggestions her father made to Reilly also related to some other options which were also rather caring as well. In that, Tiffany felt that Reilly had done quite well in his meeting with her father, which while she ended up being runner up to a human competitor who&#39;d come from eastern Nevada in the Bare as You Dare Competition, Tiffany took as a win, as it would mean that strong but caring Reilly was accepted by her father and there wouldn&#39;t be any issue with regard Reilly and Tiffany&#39;s courtship.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that really stuck with Tiffany after the Bare as You Dare Competition finished was that it would take time to get her coat to even out. The bikini cut had been an interesting attempt to try and help her odds at winning in the competition, but she also knew that come winter, she&#39;d prefer to have a full coat to help insulate her.</p>
