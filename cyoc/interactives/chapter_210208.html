<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day went on rather quickly, with Justin directing what they would do most of the time. While he had Jeff´s memories, his character was different enough to have different interests. While most of their activities were something both liked, Justin played a few games with Jeff only watching, or badly loosing, as he didn´t like them that much.<br />
By the time they went to bed, both were happy about being together. But Jeff wasn´t sure if it would stay that way. What if they would argue and end up fighting? What if they turned into rivals because of a girl?<br />
Justin dreamt pleasant dreams about being human, with a submissive Jeff by his side. It was something he would need to think about if Jeff resets the timer and make him a permanent human. And if not, well, Jeff would be his submissive than, only not as a human anymore. Over the night, Justin more than once creamed his boxers thinking about dominating Jeff.<br />
Jeff, on the other hand, had mixed dreams. While a few were happy dreams about having a twin-brother, and what all they could do, others showed the fights he feared would come, or situations were he would change Justin back into the sock after months to eliminate his rival. Once he even dreamt that Justin would change him to get him out of the picture. That was the worst nightmare he had.<br />
In the morning, Jeff was awake earlier, as after the nightmare he couldn´t sleep anymore. It didn´t let him rest that Justin could control him. Maybe, if he kept his brother, he would make him forget the program? Or simply unable to use it? He would need a bit of time deciding this.<br />
When Jeff headed to the bathroom, he noticed Justin had kicked away his blanket, and he took a double take seeing the stained underwear his brother wore. What the hell was he dreaming about? He made a dash for the bathroom, needing to relief himself and to get that picture out of his head.<br />
Justin heard Jeff leave, and could guess what was the reason after feeling his boxers. He had a morning wood, and noticed the wetness as he tried to get it down. With a smile, Justin stood up and got a new pair of boxers before heading to the second bathroom. He was sure Jeff was in the first, and right now, they were alone at home. He took an extensive shower and redressed afterwards, taking his time for everything, just enjoying being human.<br />
Jeff was back in their room faster, but with no solution. Yes, he wanted a brother, and he liked having Justin around. But would that work out long term? Or would it be better to change the sock a couple of times for a day to be his brother, but otherwise be a sock? He would need to erase its memories, then, or Justin would be angry. Or would he accept it that way? Should he ask him?<br />
Justin returned to the room, finding Jeff in deep thoughts. He knew the timer neared its end, as Jeff had started this in the morning yesterday. And the switched timer had been set to the same time then the original would have been. When Jeff didn´t acknowledge him for another five minutes, Justin spoke up: “Uh, Jeff? Earth to Jeff.”<br />
Jeff was startled by Justin speaking to him, having not noticed he was back already. “Ohh, morning Justin. Sorry, I spaced out a bit. Do you need something?”<br />
“Morning Jeff. No, I´m good, but are you okay? Anything you want to tell me? Maybe talking about it will help?” Justin greeted back.<br />
Jeff didn´t want to ask his twin about switching back and forth right now. Deciding on the other bit of it, he answered: “It´s just… I don´t know if we will always work out together, or if we will fight. I… don´t know if I would be ready to make you a permanent fixture in my life, our life than.”<br />
Justin had an answer, at least to the fight-part. “You do know even normal brothers fight each other from time to time. Otherwise, I wouldn´t know about it. So yes, we will most likely fight sometimes. But isn´t that normal, then? Would you really let me become a sock again, being used by yourself, just because of something that will likely happen, but be little part of our life then?”<br />
Jeff was considering Justin´s answer. Was he really that selfish? “How about this, then? You will turn back for now, but I won´t use you like this. It won´t be long, as I just need to come to terms with the whole thing. And then I will make you my brother permanently.”<br />
Justin frowned at Jeff. “Wouldn´t be coming to terms be easier if the reason for the term, namely me, was present? And it´s interesting you can promise me permanently being your brother, just not right now? What if tomorrow, you decide you don´t want me back? If I remain aware, I would be mad at you, and if not, you will pretend this never happened?”<br />
“I don´t know. Maybe it´s just the nightmares I had, seeing you turn away, have us fighting, and me turning you back into a sock just because we liked the same girl. Or maybe I´m just not sure if we will get through this.” Jeff explained, but didn´t mention that one dream had himself become the sock by Justin´s doing. Not to give him any ideas.<br />
“That´s it? You have one nightmare, and everything we did yesterday is drawn into question? It´s not like we will like the same girl, anyway. I don´t know if you realized, but with you using me like that, I could be gay, right? I have no idea right now. And we already have differences between our characters, so how likely would this be, anyway?” Justin was angry. He liked having Jeff around, but if Jeff let the timer run out, Justin wouldn´t make him human anymore. Or just a bit as a toy or something like that.<br />
Jeff looked torn. He hadn´t much time left to decide, at least if he didn´t want to stop Justin from turning back into a sock. He sighed. Justin wasn´t wrong, they were already different. But seeing his twin being gay would be weird to him. “I don´t think I could stomach you being gay right now, Justin. You know, I have nothing against it, but right now thinking you could be is too weird to me.”<br />
A few minutes went by, with both of them silent. The timer had just reached five minutes of left human time, when Jeff finally decided. “I can´t decide this right now. I´m sorry, Justin, but right now, I won´t make you being human permanent.”<br />
Justin just shook his head, offended and disappointed by Jeff. At the same time, he knew it would be Jeff´s undoing, not his. With a huff, Justin took off his few clothes, making Jeff believe he was about to change back, and would not want to mess up the clothes.<br />
But just as he was finished, about half a minute remaining, he did something unexpected. He turned to Jeff, who was still sitting on his bed from their talk, and walked over to him. “What … mmmhh” Was all Jeff got out. The second he had started to ask what Justin wanted; Justin shoved his lightly erect cock into Jeff´s open mouth.<br />
Jeff was shocked, and didn´t start to struggle for a few seconds, in which Justin started to fuck his mouth, holding the back of his head to stop him from escaping. Jeff was powerless to stop Justin right now, and before he had any chance to realize he could fight of his brother, the timer already reached zero.<br />
Jeff didn´t know why his body simply stopped working, just as he had started to push against Justin´s body in an attempt to get him away. His just starting struggle was stifled before anything could be done.<br />
Justin laughed as Jeff´s eyes widened in fear, and realized that he was powerless now. While he used his toy even more, he explained between huffs and moans: “You see, Jeff, I switched our profiles yesterday. It won´t be me turning back into a sock for you to use, but the other way around. Meaning, you will be MY masturbation sock shortly. It´s too bad, I tried to get you to stop the timer, but you resisted.”<br />
Jeff was shocked to hear that. When had he …? The only time alone yesterday had been at the very beginning, when he was in the bathroom after changing the sock into Justin.<br />
With each push and pull Justin did, Jeff gave more way, as his body degenerated from skin, flesh and bone to simple cloth, without any resistance for the cock remaining. He was also rapidly shrinking smaller. And because of Justin´s hands, he was simply pulled upwards, his clothes falling down. His socks crumbled on the floor, his jeans and boxers dropped on top of them. A few seconds later, his shirt followed, leaving him naked.<br />
His skin was already white, his arms and legs had pulled back into his body, leaving him look like a hollow cloth-bag. It didn´t take him long to degenerate into nothing but a copy of the sock he used for his twin the day before, only that he was clean right now. His mouth was now the rim of the sock, his head and sucked in body the socks body. He didn´t realize the very tip of the sock was now his own cock and balls, not that he needed them anymore. Everything else had vanished, but he could still use his senses.<br />
Justin cummed into Jeff the second the change finished, and he happily let go of him. Jeff landed on the ground, right inside the collar of his fallen down shirt, with a wet splat sound. “That was good. Maybe I should have started a few seconds earlier, just for you to gulp down my cum before turning into cloth.”<br />
Jeff was disgusted by the cum shot into him, but as he was now being lifeless, he couldn´t stop it. While he was mostly angry and shocked about what the sock did, part of him was now regretting that he had still wanted to turn his twin back. This was disgusting, and he was helpless to do anything about this.<br />
After his afterglow ended, Justin looked down to the wet sock that had been Jeff. “You know, I dreamt about either using you like we started, with you being submissive to me, or you ending up drinking my cum as my sock. That´s why I made a mess last night. And for now, you will remain my sock, as punishment for being dumb. But I won´t promise anything, maybe you remain my sock until I throw you out. Hope you like it, sock.”<br />
Jeff shuddered mentally. Justin would keep him like this, maybe forever. Please no. But he could do nothing but hope Justin would have mercy with him.</p>
