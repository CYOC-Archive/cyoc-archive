<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate had been a stage magician for years and he was decent at it. He knew all the common <br />
tricks, pulling rabbits out of hats, levitation, card tricks, but the competition was always <br />
better and so Nate wasn't being hired. He had tried some escape artist tricks but couldn't <br />
quite get them right. He'd escape but he couldn't do so with any showmanship. He had <br />
even picked up doing naked escape tricks to make his shows more interesting and that <br />
helped but he was only getting audiences that wanted to see him naked, not audiences <br />
that wanted to see magic. He needed something better. That's when he caught the amulet.<br />
<br />
Nate had heard stories about magicians turning evil when they had real magic but Nate <br />
wasn't really that way. He hoped the amulet wouldn't corrupt him that way either. But he <br />
was willing to risk it if it made him more successful. So he spent some time practicing with <br />
the amulet and developed a new act.<br />
<br />
It was his first show where he would show off his new act but he still hadn't found a <br />
magicians assistant so he decided to ask for a volunteer from the audience. A girl <br />
encouraged her boyfriend until finally William raised his hand and volunteered.<br />
<br />
&quot;For this trick, we will saw William in half.&quot;<br />
<br />
William went along with it and the trick seemed to go exactly as predicted. In fact, some of <br />
the audience was getting bored. As William lay in the box, he did feel a strange tickle that <br />
started on his belly and then moved around his sides to his back. &quot;Hey, that felt weird. <br />
What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;Don't worry. It's all part of my act. You see, what makes my act different from <br />
the typical stage magic is that even the volunteer is fooled by the illusion. All your senses <br />
will tell you that you've been sawed in half. What you see will be yourself sawed in half. <br />
What you feel will be yourself sawed in half. But I can assure you that it's all part of the <br />
illusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
William relaxed as the two boxes he was in were separated.  But there wasn't much <br />
applause.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you aren't impressed.&quot; Nate said, &quot;How about I increase the illusion for you to really <br />
make all your senses tell you that this man is sawed in half even though it is an illusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate undid Williams shoes and socks and showed of the bare human feet. There still wasn't <br />
much applause. Nate tickled the feet and William laughed but there still wasn't much <br />
applause. Nate finally opened the boxes and lifted William's two halves out and set them <br />
on a platform where everyone could see. Finally, there was some applause and a little more <br />
interest from the audience.<br />
<br />
William went to reach for the legs but Nate stopped him. &quot;No, no, not yet. Remember this is <br />
just an illusion and you don't want to spoil the illusion so wait till I tell you and then you <br />
can feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate picked up Williams legs and set them up front and center on the stage. &quot;Now, I'm <br />
really going to impress you with my magic.&quot; William felt a little fumbling and began to <br />
complain, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; but before he finished asking, Nate had pulled his pants <br />
and underwear completely down.<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;I know a few of you have seen me do the magic naked but I decided that you <br />
need to see something new.&quot;<br />
<br />
William protested, &quot;Hey, pull my pants up. I didn't agree to be stripped on stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;Don't worry. It's just an illusion. You're not naked on stage. It just looks like <br />
you're naked on stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part of what Nate had practiced with the amulet was the ability to make people go along <br />
with his suggestions. William actually believed that he wasn't naked even though he felt <br />
naked.<br />
<br />
Nate moved over to William's torso and began undressing it as well. &quot;You will cooperate <br />
won't you.&quot;<br />
<br />
William began to pull his arms out of his sleeves as he said, &quot;I'm not taking off my shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;That's right. You're still perfectly dressed. It's just an illusion that you are taking <br />
off your shirt: an illusion to both you and to everyone in the audience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate gathered up the clothes and took them off stage to stow away. While Nate was gone, <br />
William got a good look at his own ass and recognized the birthmark he had on his left <br />
hip.<br />
<br />
William shouted, &quot;That is my ass. You're showing off my body.&quot; With that William's legs <br />
turned and began to head back toward his torso and William reached for them but Nate <br />
was faster and intercepted the legs.<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;How many times do I have to tell you that this is an illusion. Now keep your <br />
hands to your torso and I'll show you how this is an illusion.&quot; Nate lifted William's legs and <br />
brought them closer to William. &quot;Does this look like your penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
William said, &quot;Yes, it does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate asked, &quot;This nine inch uncircumcised thing looks like your penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
William said, &quot;Yes, it does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;Well that just goes to prove how realistic my illusion is.&quot; Nate turned William's <br />
legs around. &quot;And this looks like your ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
William said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;Take a closer look. Help me by spreading your legs and bending over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon William was looking at the underside of his own balls and cock between his legs <br />
beneath his ass.<br />
<br />
Nate asked, &quot;Have you seen this side of you before?&quot;<br />
<br />
William said, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;That proves it. This isn't your ass. It just looks like your ass. Go ahead and <br />
touch it to verify the illusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
William did and as he touched the illusion of his ass, he felt the illusion of a hand fondle <br />
his balls. He became erect.<br />
<br />
Nate asked, &quot;Do you feel that?&quot;<br />
<br />
William said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;That's part of the illusion. You are under the illusion that you are fondling your <br />
balls on stage in front of an audience but you don't have to worry about embarrassment <br />
because it is just an illusion so enjoy the illusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate said Williams legs down and then picked up his torso. &quot;Now walk out into the <br />
audience for me so that the rest of the audience can examine the illusion. They will find <br />
not strings or mirrors. Nothing hidden up your ass. You'll let them check that for <br />
themselves won't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
William answered, &quot;Of course. It's kinda fun being your assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
That gave Nate ideas for later but he had to concentrate on the show for now. &quot;Well stay for <br />
the whole show and even after the show I may have some people come up to examine you <br />
further.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Nate set William's torso down at a table full of ladies, he watched William's legs not <br />
completely watching where they were going, walk up to a table of frat brothers with their <br />
girlfriends. His cock was still hard and the frat brothers were daring each other to stick a <br />
candle in the ass to check for hidden wires. The ass in question was already bent over and <br />
ready for the probing while the girls were daring each other to touch the dick that was <br />
hanging out large. Nate made a quick spell to ensure William wasn't hurt by the poking <br />
around.<br />
<br />
Nate said, &quot;Meanwhile, it's time for my next volunteer from the audience. I may come back <br />
to cast more illusions on you later but for now, who else wants to experience a bit of <br />
magic. How about you.&quot;</p>
