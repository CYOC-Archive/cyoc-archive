<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The party&#39;s loud noises forced one individual named Brian out onto the back deck. He just simply couldn&#39;t handle the ringing in his ears. He closed the door behind him and walked over to the railing, he may have consumed a bit to much at this party and wasn&#39;t sure if his drink would be coming back up.<br />
While leaning over the railing he saw on the ground next to him a pale purple dress and a nice dress shirt. Brian then picked up the clothes and looked out into the backyard, assuming their owners would be nearby and likely nude. &quot;Hello?&quot; Brian called out. &quot;I&#39;ve got your clothes up here.&quot; There was no response. Little did he know he was holding the owner of one of the articles of clothing. Brian set the clothes down on the rail as he continued to lean over feeling nauseous. Then all of a sudden his nausea dissipated, only to be replaced with a different feeling. It felt like his head was on fire, though a headache was far more bearable than wanting to barf out your guts. Brian lifted his hand to rub his temples and somewhat ease the pain but his hands felt like static, as if he had been sleeping or sitting on them for a very long time. He brought his hands down only to find that his fingers had become shorter and... black? He squinted at his fingers thinking,&quot;I must be very drunk.&quot; Looking down he noticed that he was now naked. &quot;Okay, well maybe not <i>that</i> drunk.&quot;<br />
Brian then quickly plummeted to the floor of the deck. He leaned up to the best of his ability only to notice that a similar fate had taken his feet. He brought a palm to his face, by now the black had fully taken his hands, no fingers remained and their was a gaping hole in their place. It looked like a sleeve but their was no distinct line between the black cuffs and his skin. The black continued to travel up Brian&#39;s arms. He tried to reach out and touch them to one another, as if he&#39;d be able to grab the fabric plaguing where his hands normally where, but he was unable to find his fingers in the mess of fabric. It soon became evident that his fingers where gone, as the fabric part was too retreating up his arm, keeping pace with the oncoming wave of black fabric. He attempted to rest the fabric on his bare chest only to find that it was incredibly soft.<br />
Brian did his best to lean up while he still had elbows to look down at the rest of his body. His feet where now also gone, replaced by the black menace. Unlike his arms however, his legs didn&#39;t seem to be shortening. Though the black crawled forward regardless. By now Brian was scared. He was in shock and couldn&#39;t work up the energy to yell for help. All he could do was watch and feel this hollowness take him.<br />
Brian fell back once again, too much of his arms had been lost, and the parts that hadn&#39;t had become soft black textile. Brian did his best to lean his head forward to see what was happening. This plummet seemed to have given him his second wind, he began screaming and yelling for help to no avail, the music in the house was too loud. Soon after he began belting out for help he found he was unable to scream no more. It didn&#39;t feel like it was from fatigue, Brian had to muster every ounce of strength he had left to tilt his head up once more. What he saw was the fabric had reached his chest. His whole body looked completely flattened, he also noticed that his legs where no longer two separate appendages but now one single sleeve, looking a lot like a... &quot;Dress?&quot; Brian mouthed, as he was now incapable of speech.<br />
The black fabric crawled up Brian&#39;s neck, by now his arms where nothing but arm-holes and his legs where nothing but a long skirt. The black coated Brian&#39;s face as he lost his vision but still maintained his hearing. What was once Brian&#39;s mouth was now the head-hole for a long black evening dress. All he could do was feel his soft fabric laying on top of one another and hear the music from within the house full of people unable to rescue him.</p>
