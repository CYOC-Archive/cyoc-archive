<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler walked down the street in a daze. When he left the girl&#39;s house he was fine but a few minutes later his head began to hurt. Foreign thoughts were popping into his head like &#39;Maybe I should stop by the mall, bet they have some cute purses&#39; or &#39;I need to find a mate&#39;. He was so wrapped up battling these thoughts that he didn&#39;t notice his trimmed beard falling off his now smooth face. What snapped him out of it was his hair falling in front of his eyes. Since he had just gotten a haircut three days ago this perplexed him. Reaching up his hand stopped, Tyler was shocked when he saw a dainty hand in place of his normal one. &#39;it looks amazing&#39; another thought entered his mind. In a panic, he rushed down the street and found the first reflective surface he could. It was the fountain at the entrance to the park.  <br />
 <br />
He gazed down to see the face of a young woman about his age. She had long dark brown hair that reached her butt. Her beautiful facial features showed a look of pure terror as muscles shrank on her arms. Tyler looked at his other hand and watched it change to match its partner. He let out a feminine moan as his shirt began to bulge. He looked into the fountain&#39;s waters and saw the buttons fly off his shirt and fall into its waters. Tyler couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. Two mounds of flesh bigger than his head now stuck out from his chest. The nipples on his new breasts were larger than his fists had been.  <br />
<br />
&#39;I need to touch them&#39; a thought came to him. For the first time, he didn&#39;t fight it and obeyed. He gasped at how sensitive it was. His cock began to harden as he played with his new breasts. He let out a giggle as his torso gained an hourglass figure. He didn&#39;t even notice the people who had gathered around him.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly his pants began to bulge out. The cloth ripped apart to reveal halfway down his womanly hips was brown fur. His rear then continued to expand behind him taking his growing cock with it. His dick was now two feet of horse meat. Behind his equine member, his balls began to grow. His sack was now the same size as his breasts. While this was happening two bulges began to droop down to the ground. About halfway down the color shifted to white. The same happened to his front legs as all four ended in black hooves.  <br />
<br />
He let out another moan as he climaxed. cum filled the fountain as a vagina opened behind his balls and below his anus. The final change was his spine extending once more and a long horsetail finished growing above his rear. &quot;wow that was like totally amazing&quot; they said.  <br />
<br />
Tyler then noticed the crowd of people. Instead of being embarrassed the 8&#39;4 centaur herm gave a slutty grin. &quot;like what you see, well I can show you a more intimate experience if you...&quot; they were interrupted by screams of terror. Several people were running for their lives from a giant beast. Even their crowd followed suit. One girl even looked vaguely familiar as she ran around the other side of the large fountain and into the park, Tyler couldn&#39;t focus on her as she made her way to the creature. She balled up her fist and had a fire in her eye. &quot;no one scares away my fans and gets away with it&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
With amazing agility and speed, she ran at the monster. The grey furry monster didn&#39;t acknowledge her presence until she barreled into it. It let out a deep wheeze as it looked around. Tyler soon realized it couldn&#39;t see. That was either because it was blind or its fur was so thick it covered its vision. &quot;you need to stop. You&#39;re scaring my fans&quot; they said. This seemed to anger the creature as it swung its huge tail at them. They dodged it and turned around. Tyler then gave a two-legged kick to the creature&#39;s abdomen. This made the creature fall back into a taxi. The monster roared as it got up from the ruined vehicle. It charged at them with both arms outstretched. Smirking they easily dodged and the creature hit a lamppost and stumbled into a bakery&#39;s window. It reared its head up and punched the ground with its tail. It then got up and charged again. This time however when Tyler dodged the creature&#39;s tail flew in their direction. It hit their ass with such force that they got flung over a parked car. Dazed they got up and saw the creature lift the car over its head. Realizing they may have pushed their luck fear overtook them. Just as the creature was about to slam the vehicle down on them police sirens could be heard.  <br />
<br />
The creature turned in their direction giving Tyler a chance to escape. They ran for shelter and hid in the bakery the creature had destroyed. Covering their pointed ears they could still make out the gunfire and the car being dropped. Only when the sounds ended did they dare peek out the window. The creature was wounded but still alive. However, it did not move much more than some labored breathing. A police officer walked over to her with his gun raised. &quot;like don&#39;t shoot please&quot; the officer then lowered his weapon. &quot;are you okay&quot; he said. As the adrenaline added Tyler felt a painful cut on his arm. Looking down they realized they must&#39;ve hit the windshield of that car as they fell. &quot;well I&#39;ve been better. Hopefully, this won&#39;t scar&quot; they said.  <br />
<br />
An ambulance soon arrived and delivered medical aid to them and the monster. As the paramedics bandaged their arm they overheard a conversation. &quot;so who do you think they are&quot; the officer asked. &quot;no clue. The more important question is how are we gonna transport them. Even the centaur is too big&quot; a female officer said. Later a decision was made. A semi-truck would transport them both. Once it arrived they put the monster in first. To their shock, its wounds were already healing. In response they had it strapped down with some SWAT members surrounding it. Tyler followed afterward.  <br />
<br />
Once at the hospital, Tyler was directed to a room. Once inside she was greeted by a fox and an Indian male. &quot;Tyler Heath?&quot; the man said. &quot;yeah but call me Tory,&quot; Tory said. The doctor wrote something on his clipboard before speaking. &quot;well that&#39;s two of you now.&quot; he said to the vixen. The vixen pawed at the ground in a pattern of some sort. Even before the change, Tyler didn&#39;t know Morse code so they didn&#39;t know that was what it was. &quot;ah yes Tory this is your friend Brent. He got changed by the same rain. Her intelligence has increased but her gender and voice have changed. She now goes by Briar&quot; The man then ordered some tests. &quot;sorry if that felt rushed but we are getting flooded with more victims of those storms. I&#39;ll leave you two to catch up&quot; The doctor then left. The vixen looked somewhat disappointed by the results. She jumped up to a laptop and began to type. Briar then gestured to the screen but all Tory could see was a bunch of shapes. Briar placed a paw on her muzzle similar to a facepalm.  <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;so what&#39;s the prognosis doctor Adams&quot; Nurse Cynthia said. &quot;well they have diminished intelligence coupled with a lack of modesty. Their memory is also scrambled due to their mental changes. Their body has increased agility and speed but the human part is weaker than their horse part. I&#39;m afraid they may have to relearn almost everything but they seem promising&quot; Dr. Adams said. he then walked over to the creature&#39;s room. It thrashed around beneath its restraints. &quot;it seems to burn through any medication we give it.&quot; the nurse said. &quot;take a blood sample then. We need to know more about it before we can diagnose&quot; he said before leaving for another room.</p>
