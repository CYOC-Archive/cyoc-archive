<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright dear&quot; Jill said. &quot;You get the booster seat and I'll dress Ian in some of Melannie's clothes.&quot; Jill got out and opened your door. She picked you up and carried you to the back of the car. Bill had opened the trunk and one of the suitcases before taking out the booster seat.<br />
<br />
Everything except Ian's shirt had come off when Jill had picked him up and now Jill took that off too so Ian was standing there completely naked. Jill took out a pair of underwear and had Ian step into them. He noticed that they were padded and fit just a little loose. Next was a cover for the underwear which didn't feel like plastic but rather nylon. Jill took out a light yellow dress next and put it on Ian. &quot;I'm sorry about this Ian&quot; Jill said. &quot;Melannie loves her dresses and the few pants she has are at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok&quot; Ian said. &quot;It's not like people will look at me weird dressed like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That reminds me&quot; Jill said as she put sandals on Ian. &quot;What should we call you for now? I don't think we can really call you Ian while you look like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Isabella?&quot; Ian suggested. It was the first name that popped into his head. His parents had told him one time that if he had been born a girl they would have named him Isabella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isabella sounds like a wonderful name&quot; Jill said. She picked up Isabella's oversized shirt and the medallion dropped out. &quot;What's this?&quot; she asked picking it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found it on the side of the road&quot; Isabella said. &quot;I don't know what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what do you want me to do with it?&quot; Jill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stick it in the suitcase&quot; Isabella said. &quot;I don't think I can really wear it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Jill said as she placed the medallion in the suitcase and closed it. Bill had brought Isabella's other clothes around back and put them and Isabella's shirt into a plastic sack that was in the trunk. While he was doing this Jill buckled Isabella into the booster seat. As they started driving again Jill said &quot;When we get to the hotel I'll call my Uncle Jonathan. He may be able to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I always thought that he was crazy for believing that transformations happened&quot; Bill said. &quot;After what I saw I think he's just as sane as any of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there is another possibility&quot; Jill said. &quot;We could be going crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we saw the same thing&quot; Bill said. &quot;If we were going crazy we most likely would have seen something different.<br />
<br />
Isabella fell asleep even though she tried to stay awake. The next thing she knew was Jill carrying her into a hotel room and laying her down on a bed. She sat up and rubbed the sleep from her eyes. Bill had carried Melannie in and laid her down on the same bed then went back out the door. Melannie stirred a little but went back to sleep. &quot;Try not to wake Melannie Isabella&quot; Jill said in a quiet voice.<br />
<br />
Isabella nodded her head and Jill picked up the phone. After waiting a few seconds she said &quot;Hello Uncle Jonathan, it's Jill... I'm fine. We made it to the hotel ok... Well we were almost in an accident... Everyone is fine. No one was hurt... Yes I'm sure but something did happen that I hope you can help us with... Well we gave a guy a ride because his car had run out of gas... No he wasn't the cause of us almost getting into an accident... Well the thing is after we had stopped after a guy ran a stop sign he changed... Well most people would think that we were crazy but he changed into an identical twin of Melannie... He did have an odd medallion with him... It looked pretty old and had a winged figure with animal faces around it... He was wearing it when he changed... Well the only things of Melannie's that it could have possibly touched is her flower girl dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill came back in then carrying a suitcase and a potty chair. Jill nodded to him and said &quot;Well it had come off the hook when Bill was forced to stop so suddenly... You're sure about that?.. Ok then. Thanks Uncle Jonathan... I love you too. Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Bill asked after Jill had hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said that he thought the Medallion of Zulo was responsible for Isabella's change&quot; Jill said. &quot;The good news is that she'll be able to transform back into Ian after twelve hours from the time of her change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God&quot; Isabella said. &quot;I didn't want to be stuck as a girl for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Uncle Jonathan cautioned me that the medallion could disappear&quot; Jill said. &quot;Evidently there's this Brotherhood of Zulo that can sense the medallion and they'll steal it if they do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would they do that?&quot; Bill asked. &quot;They'd have to know that it would trap a person in whatever body they were currently inhabiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He said that they know&quot; Jill said. &quot;They see it as fulfilling Zulo's role as a trickster god.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I better get back down to the car then and see if it's still there&quot; Bill said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I put it in Melannie's suitcase&quot; Jill said as she opened the suitcase. &quot;It should still be in here.&quot;</p>
