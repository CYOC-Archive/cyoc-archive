<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I always wondered what being a slug was like. I want to be one!&quot; Jeff said in a fit of inspiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, a slug? Why? Don&#39;t you want to try something simpler first?&quot; Ask Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what you described and the &quot;reversed&quot; events from being a bear, I think I should be okay. And besides, in those internet stories and pictures, almost no on bothers describing what its like being a slug, the character just loses their mind. I want to try alot of forms, but a slug stands out to me right now!&quot; explained Jeff.<br />
<br />
Although Mary was safe as a bear, they wondered how to keep Jeff safe as a slug. They came up with an using a large potted plant they had outside and brought it in and keep him there until they decided to change anything throughout the day. They also decided to give Mary leeway on what to do in the case Jeff couldn&#39;t communicate with her, even with body language. Also as an option, Mary could use a size growth vial on him if wanted...and if she was okay with sex...<br />
<br />
Out of interest, they set up a video camera and mirror to see how the change would go for various perspectives. After both read some basic info on slugs just incase, noting heavily that he shouldn&#39;t be able to hear, will most likely have bad eye sight, and would be a hermphrodite. Jeff selected a vial label&#39;d &quot;Grey Garden Slug&quot;, dressed himself naked and promptly drank the slug vial.<br />
<br />
It tasted like water as Mary said, and he didn&#39;t seem to notice anything in particular about him changing, but with the mirror he saw the first changes with his head. He wondered if all the later changes from the vial would be just as random in how they progressed transformations? <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t feel the transformation itself, like if there was suppose to be a tingle or sense of movements, but his eyes growing on stalks was disorienting for a bit, along with his head changing shape and color. He LOVED seeing from this perspective, it, but suddenly remembered that his eye-sight might not be the best, and was promptly dismayed that he would miss the most of the transformation most likely. True to experience, Jeff was currently a human with a completely slug-like head, and he could only make out some shadows and shapes at the moment, most notably some things like Mary, the mirror, and some furniture. <br />
<br />
Soon the rest of him changed and he put himself flat on the floor in advance, since he couldn&#39;t see himself anyways. It was strange losing limbs, but as with the start of those whole transformation, he didn&#39;t feel like he was actively losing them, more just getting use to NOT having them. He didn&#39;t feel bones being lost, nor new body parts being gained, but his logical mind did say his anatomy was suppose to be very alien, so he tried his best to see what was new in terms of senses and feelings. Soon Jeff&#39;s changes further progressed, until there was nothing but a 2-inch, Grey Garden Slug on the floor of Jeff and Mary&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary was right.&quot; thought Jeff. He felt perfectly normal as a slug. He didn&#39;t have to think breathing, moving, or any real function a human didn&#39;t have to think about if they wanted to do this or that. He could of course make certain decisions, like keeping one eye rotated to the left, and one eye pointed forward, but he needed no learning to do this very alien action, since human eyes could turn, but human eyes didn&#39;t have stalks, much less stalks that rotate or even extend/distend. This didn&#39;t help him much though, his sight was a world of shadows and slightly-ambigious shapes. He tried to pay attention to Mary specifically with one eye while he took in his body.<br />
<br />
Before taking more time to do self examination, and sensing Mary did seem distraught from her movements since he definitely could not hear her, Jeff worked to signal to Mary that he was sentient somehow. He slowly worked to turn the whole of his body towards her. It was a slow process, but once again Jeff didn&#39;t have to actually think if this was the best way to turn, his body just knew like 2nd nature, including factoring in for slime and not just rotating the top of his body. When he finished his turn, he did his best to do a &quot;bow&quot; motion to Mary and both eyes staring straight towards her. <br />
<br />
It took a bit, but Mary figured how to do a basic &quot;yes/no&quot; system with Jeff and staying very close to him when doing any sort of signaling. Although she vividly remembered her experience as a bear, a slug was still such an alien animal to her. Trying to figure out what a sentient slug that was her husband, Jeff, was trying to convey was an experience in itself, but workable. Heck, he even seemed to use his eye stalks since it seemed to be a better way to express himself than any other part of his body. Mary brought the plant over to Jeff, and he himself signal&#39;d the go ahead. She went to pick him up, but he signal&#39;d a no to that. He moved forward to the plant itself, leaving Mary confused, but then saw him working to climb up and immediately figured out what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome!&quot; Thought Jeff. It was a slow process to just reach the plant, but he soon found himself going vertical to climb the pot. Once again he wasn&#39;t actively think about this and had great confidence from his slug form with climbing, but just slowly sliding up something vertically was in no way something a human could experience. He climbed over the edge of the inside, and his two other primary senses of smell and feel came into play.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t feel much, but still felt the detail of potted of the soil, in the same way standing bare footed on dirt vs asphalt would feel different, but somewhat simpler. He also smelled differences, he read that this sense was more simple as well, but a combination of a slug&#39;s own alien sense of his smell and the vial&#39;s normalcy pointed out some key things for him, like identifying the soil and even when Mary got close to pick him up. At 2 inches, the pot for him was huge, so he just continued moving around and trying to notice some details here and there. <br />
<br />
Soon he felt he did enough, as well as noticing Mary seemed to be restless if him paying attention to her shapes and movements were interpreted correctly. He made the motion...</p>
