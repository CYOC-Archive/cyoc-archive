<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Bro, I dunno… It was just a movie I found on Netflix! Just change the channel if you want!” Ryan sighed. “I gotta use the bathroom.” <br />
<br />
Ryan had enough of John showing off his muscles and he had to step away for a moment. He got tired of his brother’s showboating. <br />
<br />
“Come right back, little bro! They’ll deliver the pizza in a few minutes!” John shouted. “Don’t let the pizza get cold!”<br />
<br />
Ryan went to the bathroom to do his business and then he stopped by his own bedroom where he saw the old coin on his desk. He walked over to the desk and picked it up, holding the strange coin in the palm of his hand. <br />
<br />
“John is so proud of his huge muscles, and I can’t blame him. Even though I’m younger than him, I just wish I were a little bigger, a little taller, and more muscular than him.  That would be so awesome!” Ryan mumbled to himself while holding the coin in his hand. <br />
<br />
Then, just as he said that, the strangest thing happened! <br />
<br />
The coin started to emit a very bright, white light, which completely engulfed Ryan, completely blinding him for a few seconds. While Ryan was blinded by the light, several new memories from the recent couple of months flooded his mind. <br />
<br />
During the Spring, Ryan’s dad had built and set up a small home gym in their garage, for dad to use but Ryan had also begun to show interest. With their dad being very happy about that, since Ryan had always been such an introvert up to that moment, their dad hired a coach who started training Ryan in basic weight lifting and bodybuilding. <br />
<br />
Ryan quickly started to gain weight and his body began to bulk up quickly. Not only that, Ryan started to enjoy lifting weights in the small home gym, as he learned how to safely use the machines, the quat rack, and the different dumbbells which he had in the garage. He began to work out for an hour every day, and his muscles started to grow gradually and slowly. <br />
<br />
By the time John was about to come over to visit, Ryan had enjoyed a growth spurt, thanks to all the months of exercising and lifting weights, which caused Ryan to grow to an astounding 6-foot-5 inches tall. In addition, Ryan had gained a significant amount of muscle over the last few months, which forced him to start wearing his dad’s baggy clothes. <br />
<br />
So, now that it was summer and John had arrived, Ryan already had over four months’ experience lifting weights in the gym, but he hadn’t revealed anything to his big brother yet. He decided to cover everything up by wearing baggy sweats and large shirts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan! Come over here! The pizza’s getting COLD!” John shouted. <br />
<br />
Ryan carefully walked out of the bedroom, wearing a long sleeved shirt and baggy sweatpants. He was completely covered. He sat down at the chair opposite his brother, who was already seated while serving a slice of pizza on an empty plate. <br />
<br />
“So, dad told me that you started working out?” John asked him. “Is that true?” <br />
<br />
“Umm… Yeah… I guess…” Ryan just whispered. <br />
<br />
John gave his little brother a curious look. Ryan’s face still looked the same, but the rest of him just appeared… bigger all over. <br />
<br />
“Did you have a growth spurt or something, little bro? You look a little taller than the last time I saw you, which was around Christmas!” John noticed. “And, why are you wearing sweats and long-sleeve shirts? Isn’t that kinda hot, now that it’s summer?” <br />
<br />
“Umm… Yeah, I guess…” Ryan shrugged. <br />
<br />
“So, what are you hiding, bro? Come on, tell me!” John insisted. <br />
<br />
“Nothing! Leave me alone!” Ryan cried out. <br />
<br />
“Ryan! Be honest with me, man! Get up and take off all those clothes! What’s going on, here?” John just kept on saying to him. “You’re hiding something!” <br />
<br />
“Okay, big bro! You asked for it!” Ryan warned his big bro.<br />
<br />
Ryan stopped eating his pizza as he got up and walked over to where John was sitting. Then, he removed his long-sleeved shirt, revealing his well-defined upper body, along with his bulging pectorals, his large biceps and his ripped abdominal muscles!<br />
<br />
Next, Ryan removed his long sweatpants, revealing his long, thick, and massive legs, which were just huge! His quads were so big, that you could crack walnuts on them, with long, thick vertical cords of muscle running from the waist to the knees, covered with thick veins and a large, thick, vertical teardrop-shaped lump of muscle running down the middle.  Lastly, he had huge calves sticking out from the back of his legs. Ryan clearly resembled a young, up-and-coming junior bodybuilder who was preparing for a show or a competition! <br />
<br />
John stopped eating, he stood up and walked up to his hulking, 12-year-old brother. John’s jaw dropped wide open when he noticed how his younger bro actually towered over him by a whopping two inches in height! Ryan was two inches taller than him, in addition to all the muscle which was added to his frame! Ryan was truly the bigger brother now!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! RYAN! How… How did you get so… so BIG?” John just gasped, as he examined his little brother from head to toe. “You’re HUGE! I mean… You’re bigger and taller than ME!” <br />
<br />
John couldn’t believe it that he was now looking UP to his twelve-year-old brother, who was the bigger man now. John was eighteen, and in college, but his little bro, who was going to the seventh grade, had clearly outgrown him during just a few months!<br />
<br />
“I told you, John! Oh… I’m the BIG BRO from now on. So, please STOP calling me the little bro, okay?” Ryan just grinned, as he looked down on his older brother. &quot;That nickname is no longer appropriate!” <br />
<br />
John and Ryan went back to eating their pizza after this. Clearly, Ryan was the guy in charge now, and he got to make all the decision about what movie to watch and what to eat from this point going forward. He even wondered how he would compare to his older brother in the home gym. </p>
