<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick couldn&#39;t move any of his parts as he stayed on the floor in pieces together with Manny, the mannequin completely disassembled amongst the parts of his own armor. <br />
<br />
Both of them were covered in the magical spunk that Manny had accidentally spurted out when Nick tackled the mannequin in indignant fury. Now he was paying the price being stuck in pieces like this until someone walks in and reassembled both of them.<br />
<br />
Which could be Zach, and Nick didn&#39;t want to find out what Zach was. He should have taken Merlin&#39;s advice and just not wear the suit! <br />
<br />
&quot;Manny... wake up please.&quot; Nick moaned from his pleasure still reverberating through his parts. From Manny&#39;s moans he was sure the mannequin was feeling the same. The magic covering both of them was slowly fading, Nick could feel it.<br />
<br />
He could also feel his parts change, his chestplate shifting and soundlessly on the floor, growing bigger and more ornate. It was as if he was... changing..<br />
<br />
Shit... the magic wasn&#39;t fading around him, it was being absorbed into him! The two pledges, somehow he could recall their names with the horse being Trevor and the minotaur being David would surely wake up in just a moment and- of fuck Nick could remember them clearly as if they had been studs of TFU for years!<br />
<br />
The magic fluids was no doubt recharging him and then with the magic, integrating him more into the frat as a haunted piece of armor. He wiggled his armor fingers, he could feel Manny&#39;s muscular and detached parts mixed in with his parts. Parts of Sir Silver that was rapidly being fixed, changing. <br />
<br />
Nick could feel his knightly helmet grow, fitting for a powerful and large knight like himself- <br />
<br />
&quot;Manny... please. I don&#39;t want to lose... myself.&quot; Nick groaned out as his parts continued to shift. He could feel his vambraces change into a configuration meant for a thicker and stronger arm to fit into, the entirety of his lower arm becoming a sheen of shinier silver, thicker with bigger armor plates.<br />
<br />
Nick could feel it in his mind&#39;s eye of how his body was shifting about, he could feel himself change to basically fit a massive, muscular man inside him. A general&#39;s armor rather than just some lowly knight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gruuuh.&quot; The minotaur called David groaned as Trevor shifted on the floor. The shire horse stud-anthro and the minotaur lifting themselves off the floor with their incredibly muscular arms. Nick wished he wasn&#39;t transforming to fit <i>them</i>!<br />
<br />
Both of their eyes land on the pile of mannequin and armor parts, and Nick swore he could see them go wide as saucers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, Trevor wake up! Sir Silver&#39;s in pieces!&quot; The minotaur scrambled off the floor and clopped over heavily towards Nick, the thick three fingered and hooved digits landing on his runic, silver and shining armor meant for someone muscular and large.<br />
<br />
The shire stud rubbed his head and grunted, but upon landing eyes on the armor in a pile with the mannequin, he also panicked and quickly walked over.<br />
<br />
Nick was frozen again.<br />
<br />
Inside he was hoping the two would help reassemble them and then leave, so that he could finally move and get to Merl-<br />
<br />
Trevor grabbed one of his vambraces and shoved Manny&#39;s detached arm and hand into the leather padding. Nick could <i>feel</i> Manny&#39;s thick smooth digits fitting perfectly inside his own.<br />
<br />
Realization struck Nick like lightning just as it flashed outside. He was in a pile with Manny, and there was no one to control the magic he was covered in. Reality was updating him since he was increasingly more magical and therefore integrated with the clearly magically charge frat house, and the two studs were his witnesses on what he <i>should</i> be.<br />
<br />
Nick wanted to protest as his chestplate was popped open and Manny&#39;s torso was fitted into him, the donning of Nick onto Manny was rapidly being done by the Frat&#39;s two dumbest studs.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to repair Sir Silver before smith-enchanter Zach comes back.&quot; Trevor admitted as he shoved another arm of the magic mannequin into the armor. &quot;He&#39;d punish us if he finds out his golem knight was broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick could only think about this version of reality&#39;s Sir Silver. He... was supposed to be a haunted armor, but Trevor was saying he was a golem knight? <br />
<br />
Of course he was. Smith-Enchanter Zach&#39;s best protector and magic receptacle-<br />
<br />
Nick wanted to scream! That was Manny&#39;s job as the mannequin golem!<br />
<br />
<i>No, stop! Don&#39;t finish repairing me!</i><br />
<br />
Despite the desire in his heart to be whole, he didn&#39;t want it to be like this!<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, how did this happen? I remember our human lives but Sir Silver made us into who we are now.&quot; David grunted out as he assembled the golem knight. Manny the Mannequin was shoved into Nick the Knight as his legs was supported to stand on the now different stand meant to help support rather than restrain.<br />
<br />
He wanted to struggle but he couldn&#39;t even speak.<br />
<br />
He screamed silently as Manny&#39;s head was shoved into his helmet, the design having been altered to become more menacing, sharp spikes and a blockier head depicting his new form.<br />
<br />
No more would he be afraid of the rental being damaged, reality would fucking update with him and Manny as one!<br />
<br />
<i>No!</i><br />
<br />
<i>No!</i><br />
<br />
<b><i>NOOOO!!!!</i></b><br />
<br />
The helmeted mannequin head clicked into place of its home on top of the fully armored mannequin. At that moment he felt full, and whole. The very runes on his body, the sword and shield he held in his arms. He couldn&#39;t let go as magic surged through him and further wove him into the tapestry of the frat.<br />
<br />
<i>MERLIN! HELP US!</i><br />
<br />
Nick struggled as a shiny sheen made his armor gleam, even as the two dumb stud jocks hurriedly left the room. He felt filled, his entire body thick with muscles of the mannequin inside him stretching the leather straps and chainmail lining of his armor. Manny could feel his tool in his codpiece spurt more magic into the metal, fueling the runes on his body.<br />
<br />
Mannick groaned as he came entirely and fully, the fluid magic rapidly filling up his armor and he groaned in great pleasure. The frat&#39;s magic from the satyr&#39;s flowing and ebbing into him just like his duty was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Protect and Collect.<br />
<br />
He stepped off the assisting rack, his heavy body bucking with innate golem strength. <br />
<br />
Mannick shook his head, he needed to find Merlin before he lost himself into the frat&#39;s new reality.</p>
