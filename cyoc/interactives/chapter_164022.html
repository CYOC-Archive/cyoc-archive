<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff rubbed his chin as he looked at the computer, the unfamiliar scratching of stubble feeling strange on his fingers. He could.. modify a few things. He had fifteen minutes before he was needed downstairs and this big change only took about twenty judging from the clock. He moved from his bed to the computer chair and tried to figure out what to do..<br />
<br />
What if he had super masculine genetics on both sides of his family?<br />
<br />
He brought up his mother&#39;s father, which he had a memory of as a white haired older man, but in luckily this program seemed to show people in their prime. The image displayed was of a red-haired man, lean and tall. Now that someone was filling the slot, the new option to adjust appeared, but he went with generate again, trusting the keywords since that worked so well for him. He already had five picked out, some he had used before.. Ginger went in first though, he wanted to keep the coloration on that side of the family. It was quickly followed by muscular, masculine, well hung, and hairy.<br />
<br />
Generate brought up a lot less variety this time. All the men had similar coloration, paler skin with freckles and red hair. Some had lean muscles others were bulky body builder types. All had body hair and beards, though the amount varied a bit from one that had a dense patch over his chest and stomach, to another that looked like he was wearing an orange colored sweater. And all of them had large cocks between their legs.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly narrowed it down to one of the moderately hairy guys with a full beard. He didn&#39;t need or want to shave his shoulders and back, so those were out. He found one that was decently muscled, with a broad chest and thick arms. He could picture this guy in a boxing ring, it was perfect. He chose that one.<br />
<br />
The update option appeared over his portrait again, this time with his mother&#39;s also grayed out. He didn&#39;t know how much this would change, but that was part of the fun. As soon as he clicked the button, the heat returned, though it was much more subtle this time. He felt his hips and shoulders adjusting again, waist narrowing slightly as his shoulders broadened more, just a few inches but the change in his silhouette was striking. His feet gained yet another shoe size, becoming size fourteens as he felt another inch or so stretch out in his spine. His muscles followed next, none jumping spectacularly in size, but his chest and arms thickened a bit more, his grandfather&#39;s top-heavy build having an affect on the stockier one he had gotten from his father. As tingling returned to his cock, he pushed down his shorts to his knees to let it flop free. It didn&#39;t gain length, but looked to be getting thicker. He was probably far and away the best hung guy in his school, hell, he could probably show up most porn stars.<br />
<br />
With a tingling, all his body hair seemed to thicken just a bit, becoming a bit denser, even the shadow of his beard looked a bit fuller. The hair on his chest now connected with the line coming up his stomach and to the ring of hair around his nipples. The warmth subsided and he turned to glance in the mirror. The guy looking back at him could probably pass easily as a college student rather than a high school one. Which gave him another idea..<br />
<br />
He went to his own portrait, selecting the option to adjust. Two years.. that shouldn&#39;t be much of a miss. He made himself eighteen, which should make him a senior in high school as well. He clicked the update button and braced himself. He must have been an early bloomer, as there wasn&#39;t much height growth this time, but that natural teen leanness was being replace with a bit more adult bulk. He put on inches both around his chest and his arms. He thought he felt strong before, but now that was nothing to now. His thighs and calves bulked further, all the muscle growth coming with memories of hours spent in the gym, or on the field training. He was his school&#39;s star varsity quarterback, had been since last year, even as a junior he was the best in the school. is father had hoped he would play soccer, but his build was so much better for football, the coach had snapped him up.<br />
<br />
More heft even added to his dick and balls. If football fell through there was always porn, he&#39;d be a rockstar. Hair thickened all over his body, especially across his chest. He kept it trimmed to show off his physique, but didn&#39;t shave it, it covered half his pecs and all of his abs. Short black hair laying close against his skin. Even his pubes were trimmed, though that was more necessary, it got thick down there. The shadow on his face grew into a short, neatly trimmed beard. Not as full as his fathers, but once he let it grow over spring break junior year, he didn&#39;t have the heart to shave it off. It looked damn good on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff! Dinner!&quot; Came the shout from downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Co..&quot; His voice actually cracked a little, he cleared his throat. &quot;Coming!&quot; Even his voice had dropped into a lower register. The changes subsided and the man staring back at him from the mirror was just that. A man. Only the lack of any crease or wrinkle on his face really gave away his youthfulness. He could probably walk into a bar and bluff his way into a few drinks. In fact he had memories of doing just that once on a bet.<br />
<br />
He got up and pulled his shorts back up to his waist. He quickly strode over to his dresser and dug through his shirts. It was a whole different wardrobe. He picked out a black tank and pulled it on. It hugged his chest tightly, showing off his muscles. Damn he looked good, he felt his cock twitch in his pants. Getting turned on by his own body. He shook his head and headed to the door, stopping with his hand on the knob..</p>
