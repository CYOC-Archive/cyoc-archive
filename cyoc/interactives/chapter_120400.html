<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You leaned in and both of you planted a gentle kiss on each other&#39;s lips, but suddenly your body began feeling strange. Your head suddenly broke out in excruciating pain, like a migraine and you cried out in pain. You grasped your head with your hands feeling your veins throbbing on your head, and the pain kept intensifying as time went on. You could see people fleeing from you and screaming like you were some sort of catastrophic danger to them. However after you let out one last cry of agony you felt something hit the back of your head and you passed out unconscious.<br />
<br />
You woke up later dazed and confused, and you felt hungover from your migraine. You looked down and your jaw dropped when you saw that instead of hands and feet, you had large 3 toed digitigrade claws covered in red scales. You then saw a vagina further down your body on your pelvis and you wanted to scream, but for some reason the emptiness between your legs felt almost fond to you. Suddenly your head began to hurt again and you reached up to grasp it, but ended up laying down on the floor. &quot;Ahh! Wh..what&#39;s going on?&quot; You said to yourself quietly trying not to upset your migraine even more.<br />
<br />
You looked your claws and saw that all four of them were shackled to the floor, and you were inside a jail cell within what appeared to be a medieval dungeon of sorts. You certainly were larger as you stood up your head hit the ceiling and you had to lower it with your extended neck. You looked behind you and saw two large leathery wings bound closed with leather straps, and a long tail like one from a lizard layed behind you. Suddenly certain visions appeared in your mind, and you remembered yourself not as a human, but a dragoness just like the one that you have become. Just then a name popped into your mind, and you recognized it as being yours, and that made you wonder,&quot;why?&quot;<br />
<br />
You began questioning your memories with these new ones, and thinking back to that name,&quot;Cilea&quot; over and over again. However you still didn&#39;t know why you were here, and your head hurt more each time you tried to come up with your own answers, so you called out into your surroundings,&quot;Helloooo?! Is anyone there? Please can someone tell me what&#39;s happening, or what happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
For a few moments there was nothing but silence, but then you saw an older looking man with gray hair and a beard in a cloak walk up to the door of your cell accompanied by two guards. You gulped feeling that you should have just been patient and waited, but then the man looked at you like he was studying you. The man reached his hand through the bars of the cell in attempts to touch you, and you back away from him as quickly as you could breathing heavily and afraid up against the cold stone wall.<br />
<br />
The man then pulled his hand back from the bars and looked crossly at the guard closest to your cell door. The guard took out some keys and hesitantly gave them to the man, and the old man took them from him. The other guard just stood there and watched, and then the man looked at both of them turning his back to you. There was a silence then the man suddenly yelled angrily at the guards,&quot;What is weong with you two?! When a guard willingly gives his keys to a superior then they, along with any additional guards are to leave!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s firm and raging tone startled you along with the guards, and moments later the guards nodded and left and you could hear their footsteps disappear in the distance. The man turned around and unlocked your cell and slowly walked inside with you. Afraid and confused you backed away from this man and seeing his affect on the guards made you fear him. You figured you were going to be dead at any moment now when your rear pushed up against the wall opposite to the door, and the man slowly approaching you by the second. You closed your eyes hoping for a quick end when suddenly you felt the man touch his hand to the bridge of your muzzle, and he began petting it gently.<br />
<br />
You opened your eyes and saw the man petting you and as he did he spoke in a different tone saying,&quot;Shhhh, it&#39;s already now, I won&#39;t harm you as long as you don&#39;t harm me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked up at the man and he removed his hand from your muzzle and you asked,&quot;Wh...what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not harm you as long as you don&#39;t harm me. Of course I don&#39;t expect that seeing how afraid you are, but there&#39;s multiple ways fear is expressed. Now tell me, who are you?&quot; The man asked in a calming tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m human man...no I&#39;m a dragoness, no human, no....aack! I...don&#39;t know which one I am, which one I truly am.&quot; You growled grasping your head on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that maybe something like this would happen, but I&#39;ve never seen the full extent of it until now. You appear to have lifted a curse set upon you, one that seems to have taken over your mind before you cured yourself.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
&quot;A...curse?&quot; You asked and you suddenly got a flashback vision, and you saw what appeared to be a witch, and she casted a spell on you of sorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be in lots of trauma, but I can assure you that this is your true form.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
&quot;I...remember things, are they memories? Earlier I saw a name and felt oddly fond with my body when I awoke. Now I see a woman but it&#39;s blurred, and there was a blue light from her hands, and a flash and....nothing, I can&#39;t see what happened.&quot; You said breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely the moment that you were cursed, and most like you usually see nothing after a certain point like you did before it goes blank. Do you remember anything from when you were cursed? How you broke it?&quot; The man asked<br />
<br />
&quot;How I...broke it?&quot; You asked and suddenly you remembered kissing that princess girl and you blushed feeling embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god that princess from that renaissance fair. When I was a human, a man I kissed her and then....*sigh* this.&quot; You said feeling ashamed of yourself and pounded the ground and cried,&quot;Damn it! Why did I do that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down please, I have talked to the princess and she seems ashamed about it too. But thankfully she&#39;s quite a kind soul, and she&#39;s willing to forgive you if you promise that you shall never speak of it again.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I wish to talk about it at all? I feel like I&#39;ll regret it for the rest of my life now, and a mere apology wouldn&#39;t come close to forgiveness here.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;There there, now how about we get you out of here and into a nest within a place that&#39;s more comfortable for you miss....&quot; the man said<br />
<br />
&quot;Cilea, I think, it&#39;s the name that I remembered upon seeing myself. As for the nest, I would highly appreciate that and I can&#39;t thank you enough.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t thank me, the princess herself commissioned this for you seeing a sort of &#39;kindness within your heart&#39; as she put it even while you were unconscious. By the way she has a special request for you in exchange for kindness towards you, and she wishes you speak with you personally.&quot; The man said and he snapped his finger and suddenly your bindings and shackles came undone by themselves, and you were able to stretch your wings and body freely.<br />
<br />
You looked at the man in awe and asked him,&quot;Who are you exactly? And what was that thing you did with your fingers, and my shackles?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Drake the headmaster wizard in these parts, and I believe the title speaks for itself as to answer the second question.&quot; The man, Drake said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, magic...it seems familiar, but only vaguely. Then again I was cursed as you said so I guess that should have been expexted. It&#39;s nice to meet you by the way Drake.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;The same pleasure goes to you Cilea, just stay close and I&#39;ll vouch for you if anyone asks.&quot; Drake said, and you nodded.<br />
<br />
Drake began walking and you followed him shortly behind him, and he took you past a few guards before entering a long hallway. Everything seemed so medieval and fantasy-like that it was almost daunting. &quot;Excuse me Drake, do you mind if I ask you what year it is? Or more like what kind of world are we in?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The year has not changed, but as for the world, welcome to Hyragem, a world few know about. That &#39;fair&#39; earlier was merely just to mask up the truth, and coincidentally the princess volunteered for it this time around.&quot; Drake said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how did we enter it? What happened?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You were already within it when your curse was lifted, but there&#39;s a barrier to block any and all beings besides non-magical humans, and non-mystical creatures from exiting.&quot; Drake said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, then how did I exit it then if I was really like this?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe since you were a non-magical human, but the barrier should have repelled you because of the curse.&quot; Drake said<br />
<br />
Minutes later Drake walked you over to a door and stopped.&quot;The Princess is right beyond here waiting for you inside her own quarters. She wanted to discuss the....incident privately so that nobody would hear.&quot; Drake said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I hope there&#39;s no hard feelings, I still can&#39;t believe that I did that.&quot; You said embarrassed, and Drake knocked on the door. Moments later the door cracked open, and then opened all the way and that princess from earlier was standing inside wearing a similar, but different dress than before. &quot;Please come in and close the door behind you.&quot; The princess said<br />
<br />
Drake gestured you to enter first, so you did, and Drake followed you in shutting the door behind the two of you as you entered the room. You stood there in the room stunned, and unsure what to do or say in this situation. Drake then stepped forward and bowed before speaking then said,&quot;Lady Alisa, before you assume anything about our dear friend here, you should probably know thaat she was cursed and unaware of her actions. She can&#39;t seem to remember who she was completely before all of this, and she remembers what happened during the incident, and regrets her actions deeply.&quot; <br />
<br />
Princess Alisa nodded then turned towards you and you felt extremely nervous just standing here with her right now. Princess Alisa then walked up to you and pet the top of your head and said,&quot;It&#39;s alright to be nervous, you can make yourself comfortable if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed then sat down where you were and bowed your head,&quot;Princess, my name is Cilea, and I am so sorry for what I did, I can&#39;t apologize to you enough for how offended you must feel because of me, and I hope that I can make everything up to you for what I did.&quot; You said looking down at the floor.<br />
<br />
Moments later Princess Alisa lifted your head and smiled at you,&quot;I forgive you, and thankfully your sudden transformation attracted the most attention, so I should apologize to you for the less than suitable accommodations given to you in the dungeon thus far. But of course you did make a scene, and knowing Drake you probably already know about your new quarters and a personal request from me.&quot; Princess Alisa said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been told about it yes, but as to what the task is I haven&#39;t been told yet, but after hearing what you&#39;ve done for me I will do it no matter what it is.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to feel that guilty towards that little scene. Besides you are going to be serving me exclusively so you can just call me Alisa. As for my request, I want you....&quot; Princess Alisa began</p>
