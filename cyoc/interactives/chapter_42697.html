<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was awoken again, this time from blood running into his body, and a pressure on his body, coming through the pants. Jake felt a pulse run through his body as he spit a glob of sweet-sticky pre-cum out of his mouth. The pressure on his body felt quite pleasurable, as Jake felt his body expand. Jake moved his arms to his face to wipe what pre-cum he could away from his mouth. As his hands touched his face, Jake was suprised by what he found. His nose was gone completely and his mouth was turned sideways, and had pushed out some. Jake found it difficult to keep his mouth/slit closed as more pre-cum came bubbling up from deep within.<br /> <br /> The fabric in front of him began to shift and Jake fell forward some his face pushing against the rough denim fabric of Jeremy's jeans. Jake then felt something tightening around him, near his waist, causing his body to become rigid and the sound of Jeremy's heartbeat pound in his head. The pressure from outside resumed, though the general feeling was slightly different, slower this time. After a couple minutes the pressure went away and Jake heard some quiet talking, though he couldn't make out what was being said from his position. Then dim light shone down as the waistband of the jeans was pulled away and the button undone. In that time Jake wasn't able to see who was with Jeremy but it was obvious that it was a guy due to the biceps on the muscled arm that embraced Jeremy. Soon the zipper was pulled down and Jeremy's jeans pushed down.<br /> <br /> The light momentarily blinded Jake, and when he opened his eyes he was looking directly into a giant face that looked familiar. After a few blinks, to adjust his eyes, Jake recognized the face, it was his younger brother, Mark! &quot;Wow, it really worked! And he's coming along nicely.&quot; Jake was shocked, was his brother somehow connected with what happened to him? Jeremy made a slight chuckle as Mark looked over Jake's new form in amazement.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, he was much easier to convince than we thought. I still don't quite understand why we had to g to all this trouble though&quot; Jeremy said, idly rubbing his balls, sending tremors of soft pleasure through Jake.<br /> <br /> &quot;We had to make sure he was out of the way before we moved to the next stage of my plan&quot; Mark said with a conspiratorial wink to Jeremy. Jake tried to yell at them but his new mouth couldn't form any intelligible words, what few sounds he could make were quickly drowned out in waves of pre-cum.. Mark grabbed Jake around the base, just above the cock-ring Kyle had become and began to slowly stroke up the shaft.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don't worry big brother, I'm going to take good care of you. After all, you're my boyfriend's dick now.&quot; Jake's eyes were wide with shock as Mark gave him a wicked grin. Mark leaned forward and licked at Jake's legs, causing Jeremy to moan and Jake to thrash about. Jake was overcome with the pleasure, but he still reached out with his arms and tried to hit Mark in the face. <br /> <br /> Mark pulled back a moment and said &quot;Now, you're going to have to behave&quot; and reached out and wrapped his hand around Jake's body, pinning his arms to his sides. Mark continued to lick Jake's legs and slowly began to stroke him, coaxing even more pre-cum out. After a few minutes Mark slid his tounge up Jake's body and took Jake into his mouth. The pleasure was so intense that Jake stopped fighting for the moment as he moaned and shot a wad of pre-cum down his brother's throat. Jake could soon feel a pleasant pressure building inside him as his balls pulled up close. Suddenly he was pulled out of his brother's mouth before he reached the point of no return.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, you tease&quot; Jeremy said with a smile on his face. Jeremy bent down and began to make out with Mark, rubbing Mark's crotch through his pants. Jake watched as Jeremy disrobed Mark, and once naked resumed making out, grinding Jake into Mark's cock and hip. The sensations were quite pleasurable, but Jake was disgusted by the idea of his best friend and his brother making out and having sex. Jeremy lay down on the bed, Jake laying on top of his abs. Mark spread Jeremy's legs and began to rim Jeremy, loosening his hole. Jake wasn't sure what was going on, though he felt Mark's forehead on his balls. Jake was finding it harder to look down, and his arms were feeling too weak to lift his body.<br /> <br /> Mark stood upright and positioned his cock at Jeremy's ass and slowly started to push in. Both Jeremy and Mark moaned at the penetration. Mark started pumping in and out of Jeremy's ass, rubbing against his prostate. Though Jeremy's prostate was not part of Jake he felt surges of pleasure course through his body as Jeremy was fucked. Mark reached down and began to stroke Jake's body. With a long, drawn out moan, Mark began to unload into Jeremy's ass. At the same time the pressure that had been building finally released as jet after jet of hot cum shot out of Jake's mouth hosing Jeremy's abs and chest, a few even hitting him in the chin.<br /> <br /> Mark collapsed on top of Jeremy sandwiching Jake between them. The three of them began to drift off to sleep in their post-coital bliss.</p>
