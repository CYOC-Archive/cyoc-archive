<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She listened to the shower as she stared at the bathroom door and wondered if her brother-turned-sister was somehow responsible for the fact that she was now a he. Thinking it wasn&#39;t possible, Holly started to turn away, but then stopped as she asked herself, &quot;What other choice do you have,&quot; and giving the bathroom door one final look, she considered how long she might have before Taylor was finished.<br />
<br />
Not caring, her desire to get rid of her boy parts outweighing her commons sense, she turned away and tip-toed down the hallway to her sister&#39;s room. Pushing open the door, she considered what she might say if the other girl was still in the room, but seeing only the empty bedroom, Holly hastily slipped in. Asking herself, &quot;If she did take it, where would she had hid it,&quot; the twelve year old girl peered at the girl&#39;s bedroom and thought, &quot;Ugh. Even as a girl, Dion is still a slob,&quot; as she took in the clothes left on the floor, the stuff piled up on the dresser and matching vanity, the unmade bed and, for reasons she didn&#39;t understand, their mom&#39;s rubber dish washing gloves, one carelessly left on the floor, one on the nearby dresser.<br />
<br />
Not sure why her sister had them, she bent down and peered under the bed. Taking in the dust and toys and whatnot discarded underneath, she poked at the various bits before deciding the necklace wasn&#39;t there. Standing, she pulled the pillows from the bed, tossed them back on, then proceeded to go through the dresser, then the vanity. Not finding the amulet in any of those places, she glanced at the closet. Knowing that, just like in her room, there was a loose piece of panelling to get at the plumping, she wondered if maybe Taylor had stashed it there. Taking a step toward the closet, and accidentally kicking the glove in the process, she stopped when she heard a soft creak from the floor.<br />
<br />
Gazing down at the floor, she tapped her foot against it, the bent down and ran a hand over the hard wood. Thinking something seemed off, she soon found that one of the boards didn&#39;t sit quite right and working at it, she discovered that it was not only loose, but also pulled away. Thinking, &quot;Could you have?&quot; she dug her finger nails in and after a bit of working at, she lifted the board away and gazed into the hole.<br />
<br />
A cry of elation nearly escaping her, Holly quickly covered it up by thinking, &quot;Oh, you are so going to pay,&quot; as she spotted the Amulet of Zulo, still in the Ziploc bag and lifting it out, she hastily dropped the board back in place, made sure it was as flat as it was going to, then tip-toed as fast as she could out of Taylor&#39;s bedroom. Hearing the shower was off already, Holly paused for a moment, fear griping her that she was about to be discovered, but then, forcing herself to move, she fled to her room, where she shut and leaned against the door, breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;So things are as bad as I thought,&quot; she bleated after a moment and pushing away from the door, Holly marched toward her dresser, where she took a fresh shirt out.<br />
<br />
Staring at the short sleeved garment, taking in the pink hearts, spades, diamonds, she considered taking the necklace from the bag and using it right away. But remembering there was a time limit between changes, she tried to recall how long it was. Drawing a blank, she sighed and decided, &quot;I&#39;ll have to wait,&quot; before swearing, &quot;Dammit,&quot; as she angrily thought it would be until sometime between three and six before she could use the amulet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to be on the safe side,&quot; she told herself as she folded and placed the shirt back in her dresser.<br />
<br />
Displeased that she would have to wait all morning and a good part of the afternoon, if not all of it, Holly considered hiding the Amulet of Zulo, but worried that her brother-turned-sister might come looking for it, she jammed it into her pocket, which caused the front of her pants to brush against her boy parts.<br />
<br />
Nauseated by the touch, hating where her privates now where, Holly tried to force them from her mind as she told herself, &quot;Just a couple hours and they&#39;ll be gone,&quot; and turning away from her dresser, she exited her room and headed down for breakfast.<br />
---<br />
<br />
The morning passed without incident and Holly found herself glad that she didn&#39;t develop anything else a boy might have as she ate lunch, then went outside, mostly to get away from Taylor. Despising what her sister had done, Holly spent the next two hours thinking of ways to make her pay, but soon found the thoughts driven from her mind when a tingling sensation in her feet and hands became too much to ignore.<br />
<br />
Scared that it meant something was happening that was tied to the magick of Amulet of Zulo, she ducked inside and crept up to her room, passing Taylor on the way, who smiled and made a series of barnyard animal noises. Ignoring her, thinking, &quot;Keep it up. You&#39;ll pay,&quot; Holly just barely got her bedroom door closed before the tingling sensation, which was pushing toward becoming a painful cramping feeling, became too much for her to bear. Gasping as she pushed the door closed, she uttered a noise that sounded like a combination between a bleat and a sound that was close to, &quot;Uhhhahhh,&quot; and dropping to her bed, she peered at her left hand as she struggled to get the Ziploc bag out of her pocket.<br />
<br />
Her fingers refusing cooperate and bend, she grunted in discomfort before finally managing to pinch it between two finger and pull it free. Dropping it on the floor when a spike of pain ripped through her hands, Holly started to reach down for it, but at the last moment shifted and began to work her socks and shoes off of her feet. Gasping at the deformed mess, the twelve year old girl held her arms crooked so that her hands were held loose and draped downward. Whimpering as the pain grew, she watched as her toes and fingers melded together and turned black.<br />
<br />
Frightened by what she saw, she bleated out an inarticulate noise that reminded her of a sheep of goat. Watching as her feet and hands melded into four, cloven ungulate hooves, she tried to cry out, &quot;No, please, no,&quot; but was dismayed when all she managed to make was more goat and sheep sounds.<br />
<br />
White fur starting to grow up her arm, Holly began to cry as she desperately rubbed her hand-turned-hooves against her arms in an effort to rub away the growth, which stopped just shy of her elbows. Sniffing, bleating out every so often, she stared at the horror her hands and lower arms had become. Trying to say, &quot;This cannot go any further,&quot; and only hearing the normal sounds of a sheep or goat, Holly looked at the Ziploc baggy with the amulet inside.<br />
<br />
Not sure how she was going to get it out, but knowing she had to before she changed any more, the twelve year old girl slid off her bed. Sure she couldn&#39;t stand up on the ridiculous hooves she now had, noting as she dropped to the floor that she also had white fur covering her lower legs, she huffed in agitation and tried to find a way hold her hooves in a way to grasp and open the baggy. Failing to do that, she tried pinching it with one hoof, then trying slide her other hoof into the edge and force the bag open. That also not working, Holly tried a couple more tricks, including using her rear hooves, before leaning down, grasping the baggy in her teeth and, after wiggling it back and forth, managed to pin it with her front hooves and pull it open using her teeth.<br />
<br />
The Amulet of Zulo finally out of the bag, Holly leaned back against her bed. Breathing hard, she stared up at the ceiling, scared to talk aloud, wanting to go back to her old life, and wanting more than anything to get revenge of Taylor for what she did. Running a hoof through her hair, Holly stopped when she felt something off and bleating out, &quot;Great. Fan-fucking-tastic,&quot; she tried to ignore the hard nubs that marked the growth of two horns as she stood.<br />
<br />
Unsteady, her balance wobbled and for a moment, Holly was certain that she was going to fall over before she managed find her balance. Taking an shaky step forward, she almost did fall and resting a hoof on her bed, she did a crawling sort of walk toward her dresser, where she found the next obstacle in her way was getting the dresser open.</p>
