<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark wiped his brow, glancing at the assembly line before him. The Soul Drive factory had certainly ramped up production over the last couple of months.<br />
<br />
When he had heard that a new factory was opening near town, Mark had quickly jumped at the opportunity. After being laid off from the robotics factory due to budget cuts, he had begun to grow desperate for work. He had a family to feed and with only a high school education his prospects for employment were slim. This is what led him to the Soul Drive factory. The pay was good, the benefits were excellent, and the work was enjoyable. Today though was a special occasion though. Rumors abounded that the owner of the plant would be conducting a tour.<br />
<br />
The sound of a whistle now drew Marks attention, as well as the rest of the employees. Glancing towards the far end of the factory, Mark now observed a well dressed man slowly making his way towards him along with three other companions. <br />
<br />
Looking at the man, Mark was surprised to see how unremarkable he was. He was an average looking man with neatly combed brown hair dressed in a business suit. Mark for a moment had thoughts of male models in department store commercials, unremarkable good looking men who seemed to represent the suburbs. As he passed, Mark gave him a polite smile.<br />
<br />
The Boss grinned giving Mark a polite wave. Mark simply watching him go as an attractive Korean woman, a silver haired man, and a small girl with red hair passed him by. All three seemed to give Mark little of his time, the sound of their dress shoes on the concrete floor echoing throughout the factory floor.<br />
<br />
Making his way into a private office, the Boss now locked the door before closing the blinds. After everything that had happened with the Catalyst, he had decided to take a more subtle approach. Purchasing this factory for production of Soul Drives had been easy. Actually constructing them though had been a bit more complicated. The plus side though was that the location of the factory was on the outskirts of Darren&#39;s hometown.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; the Boss asked. &quot;How has production gone so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus now allowed the illusion of himself to expire. The handsome, silver haired man&#39;s appearance now graying, his skin cracking, as his eye of red light now glowed maliciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fortunately our corporate spies in Japan were able to steal the blueprints for the Japanese model,&quot; he stated. &quot;Useing their specs and some of our magic we&#39;ve been able to duplicate the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do they perform?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus sighed as he glanced over the reports. &quot;Regrettably they are not as efficient as the Catalysts version. We&#39;ve only been able to reproduce them at 95 percent of what the Catalyst has created.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was to be expected,&quot; the Boss said softly. Slowly he now turned to Choon Hee, the Korean woman waiting patiently to give her sales numbers. &quot;What about our profit margins,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re great,&quot; Choon Hee replied happily. &quot;But do you mind if I change first. This human form is a bit uncomfortable.&quot; The Boss nodded watching as Choon Hee now shook, as if she were stepping out of a pool. The womans body now transforming, becoming leaner as brown fur now covered her body. The Boss watched as her face began to change, her mouth forming into a muzzle, her ears shifting to the top of her head. Finally her nine tails fanned out behind her as she kicked off her heels, stretching out her toes on her digigrade feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Anyway like I was saying our profit margin increased worldwide by about 15 percent. Our company was actually listed as one of the fastest growing companies in the world. We&#39;re poised to make billions by the end of the fiscal year.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss simply nodded, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. &quot;And what is the population of Soul Drives in this sleepy Pacific town of Darren&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Around 10 percent of the population is Soul Drives,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;Its the largest concentration of Soul Drives in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that was to be expected,&quot; Choon Hee added. &quot;Right Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss nodded, it made sense that Darren&#39;s home would have the largest concentration of Soul Drives. The Catalyst would keep his creations close by, slowly expanding outwards as time passed. The problem for the Boss was, these Soul Drives weren&#39;t loyal to the Normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may ask,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;Why start up this company and operate it so close to the Catalyst?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To keep an eye on him,&quot; the Boss answered. &quot;With Evan gone and Morgan off the reservation, we need to keep tabs on what the Catalyst is up too. That and turning a hefty profit always warms my heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re not going after the Catalyst,&quot; Choon Hee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure Morgan has that covered,&quot; the Boss said. &quot;And when she goes off we don&#39;t want to be in the line of fire. No, I have a different idea.&quot; The Boss now motioned towards a side door, Casseus, Ann, and Choon Hee watching as he now opened it, revealing the latest addition to the team.<br />
<br />
&quot;A goblin,&quot; Choon Hee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last goblin,&quot; the Boss grinned. &quot;The Normal eliminated them quite awhile ago. I&#39;ve been keeping Remy here on ice since.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus, Ann, and Choon Hee now looked at their diminutive companion, the goblin surprisingly dressed in a rather expensive looking suit that covered his pudgy form. Remy now turned his head upwards gazing at the Boss. &quot;You wanted to see me Boss,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard a goblin speak properly before,&quot; Casseus stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or be dressed in anything that wasn&#39;t a dirty loincloth,&quot; Choon Hee added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that,&quot; The Boss stated. &quot;Yeah we had to do a little reprogramming with Remy here. The gobbledygook speech and bare pudgy ass doesn&#39;t exactly scream professionalism. Taking out the goblins wasn&#39;t easy and the stench of their homeland still burns my nose but, it was worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you asked Casseus,&quot; the Boss smiled. The Boss now knelt down a proud smile on his face as he gazed into Remy&#39;s beady eyes. &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell them Remy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbos technology is second to none,&quot; Remy stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I let him keep referring to himself as Gobbos,&quot; the Boss interrupted. &quot;The word always makes me laugh a little. Anyway, please continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Remy said slowly. &quot;As I was saying Gobbos are naturals when it comes to technology. The advancements Gobbos made surpasses anything humans have ever done. Human technology today pales in comparison to what Gobbos accomplished. Its like comparing a computer chip to a caveman spear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m well aware of how technologically advanced the goblins were,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;But how does that help us in our current situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two reasons,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;One, Remy here is going to be working on upgrading our Soul Drives, putting them on par if not better than what the Catalyst produces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And whats the second reason,&quot; Choon Hee asked.<br />
<br />
The Boss now motioned to Remy, the others watching as the pudgy goblin now lifted a small container into the air. Casseus, Ann, and Choon Hee slightly confused by the thick silver liquid contained within.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remy has manufactured a nanobot that can gain control of the Catalysts Soul Drives,&quot; the Boss said happily. &quot;Right now their operating systems prevent us from useing them to our advantage. Remy here has devised this nano solution to override their systems and allow us to control them. And the best part is the Soul Drives wouldn&#39;t recognize the problem until they were completely under our control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To stop the Catalyst,&quot; Casseus grinned. &quot;And we&#39;re sure it works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remy guarantees it,&quot; Remy replied proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only problem right now is the delivery system,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;We have to get close to the Soul Drives and place this liquid on them. And currently we only have enough for one or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it takes awhile to make,&quot; Remy added. &quot;It takes Remy at least six monthss to produce this much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s where I need you Ann,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;Think you can get one of the Soul Drives with this. Maybe, tear a couple apart in the process?&quot; Ann grinned, the vampire child stomping her foot once for yes.<br />
<br />
The Boss smiled, opening a cabinet as he now poured out five glasses of champagne. &quot;Ladies, gentlemen,&quot; he stated. &quot;A toast. To the Normal and its latest endeavors. May we have good fortune in the year to come.&quot;</p>
