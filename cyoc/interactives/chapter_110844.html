<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bus screeches to a halt in front of a small gas station as a small crowd of students wait patiently to get on. One by one, kids climb the steps, and seeing me, they stop to bow before taking their place in back. And one by one, I am disappointed. This is my boyfriend Derek&#39;s bus stop and he normally sits with me in the back for some private time before school. &quot;Where is he?&quot; I say waiting for my prince charming to walk up those steps.<br />
<br />
Mr. McKelly starts to close the doors when a faint shout could be heard coming from down the street. &quot;Wait for me!&quot; I rise out of my seat and squint out the window at the sprinting figure. &quot;It&#39;s Derek!&quot; McKelly shifts gears to continue along the route but I order him to wait. &quot;Yes, of course Your Majesty&quot; He replies politely before putting the bus back into park and reopening the doors. I focus my attention back onto Derek who is about halfway to the bus now. He really is a sight. Derek is the school&#39;s star athlete and watching his amazing body churn in his stride is one of the reasons I made a point for him to be my boyfriend. Another being dating him would make us the power couple of the school. But he really is a beautiful man. Derek stands 6&#39;4&#39;&#39; and has really broad shoulders, a large beefy chest, a stomach so chiseled you could cut diamonds on it, and an amazingly firm, strong, and large butt. Even watching him walk away casually is game to cause a scene in the hallway. Oh and the sex is out of this atmosphere! During sex, I love to grab onto his ass and just let him ride me all the way home. And his dick... beyond compare. Before we started dating back before he was a total Adonis, some of the guys in the locker room knew he liked me and tried to mess with him by pantsing him in front of me and some of my friends. Everyone got an eyeful and by the look of the pranksters&#39; face, he was especially gifted with his 8 inch long flaccid penis. He was been mine ever since, I made sure of it.<br />
<br />
But now Derek has finally reached the bus and climbs the stairs to the top. He runs his hands through his short tawny brown hair and searches the bus aisle for me with his beautiful emerald green eyes. &quot;Hi baby! How are you Derek? I missed you.&quot; Derek walks up to my seat and bows low. In a smooth and low voice he says &quot;Your Majesty, Queen Jennifer, it is an honor to be in your presence&quot; and starts to walk off to the back with the rest of the drones. &quot;What? Wait Derek.&quot; He turns around shocked. &quot;Yes, Majesty? Did I do something to disrespect you?&quot; &quot;No, but um, why don&#39;t you come and sit next to me.&quot; &quot;Anything you wish, Your Majesty.&quot; He walks back up the aisle, bows, and sits down next to me in the seat with his backpack between his legs. &quot;Thank you for this honor, Your Majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sure, babe.&quot; Seeing him, my big strong man, acting so submissive is really starting to turn me on. I put my hands in my lap, squeezing my huge breasts together to where he has no choice to look. &quot;Well I know a way you can make it up to me.&quot; He politely laughs but starts to rub his hands on his jeans. &quot;Awe, baby. Are you getting flustered? Don&#39;t worry. We might be in the front of the bus, but we can still fool around.&quot; I pick up his hand in mine and place it on my breast right where the fabric ends and my chest wobbles around the seam. He starts to salivate and and kiss him and straight on the mouth. At first he  seemed reluctant but then as I inched my other hand closer and closer to his crotch he got more into it, twisting his body to align with mine. We keep making out for a few stops, the plastic seat grazing my exposed pussy exciting me with every bump and pebble on the road. We pick up more kids at different stops, but they just bow quickly without words before scurrying off to the back, letting us continue. Derek breaks away from the hot kiss, dazed and lovedrunk. &quot;Majesty, that was spectacular. Though your radiance is infinite, it seems that your breasts have grown in size and... &quot; he sticks his face in my chest and takes a large whiff &quot;... aroma since last we saw each other. And may I say, I find you to be the ultimate form of attractiveness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting more and feeling my exposed pussy drip onto the bus seat, I say &quot;Okay well let&#39;s do something about that&quot; and get on top of his lap. My breasts are resting on top of his pecs and his face is forced inside my massive cleavage, not that he&#39;s complaining. Derek moans but it&#39;s untelligible so I grab his shirt in my fists and go back to kissing him. &quot;I need you now, Derek. I need you to take me sky high. Let&#39;s pull out your rocket and send me to the stars!&quot; I stop kissing him and starts undoing his belt. When I touch his belt however, the glaze lifts from his eyes and he shakes his head. &quot;Majesty... I can&#39;t do this.&quot; He picks me up from his lap and sits me back down next to him with no effort at all. I readjust from the shock of being turned down to slouching and putting on my fake &quot;pouty&quot; face. This look never fails to get him to do whatever I want. &quot;Why, baby? Don&#39;t you like it when I fuck you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek straightens up in his seat and takes my hand in his. &quot;Majesty. I am proud to have been able to bask in your beauty for as long as I have and to have been the first man to take you into my bed.&quot; &quot;Yeah, so?&quot; &quot;Well now you are our Queen. And you have responsibilities to your people and to your kingdom. You will be the Birth Mother to all of our future generations.&quot; My face drops. &quot;You know about how I&#39;m going to get pregnant?&quot; &quot;Yes, we all do&quot; he says gesturing to everyone on the bus who nod in agreement. Creepy, they were all watching us. &quot;But I cannot be the first one to take you as Queen. That right belongs to Lord Kyle, your Royal Sire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Kyle? What does he have to do with this?&quot; &quot;Queen Jennifer, my love, while you will birth many, many strong healthy children some will need to be in charge. As Royal Sire, it is his privilege to be the first to mate with you and any children produced from your union will be considered royalty.&quot; My heart breaks into a million pieces. &quot;I have to have sex with Kyle? And have his babies? I thought the wish didn&#39;t include him.&quot; I put my hands in my face and start to cry. Derek quickly grabs some tissues from his bag and lifts my chin up to wipe the tears off my cheeks. &quot;There, there Majesty. It will okay. This is the way it has to be. I would love to take you here and now to breed with you and do my duty for the kingdom. Believe me, your breasts&#39; pheremones&quot; he gestures to the sweat glistening off of my boobs &quot;are making it very difficult for me to contain myself. Only Lord Kyle, however, is allowed to take the first mating.&quot; I start to tear up again. &quot;But I don&#39;t want &#39;Lord Kyle&#39;. I want you Derek.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wipes my tears away again as the bus pulls up to the school. &quot;You must. It is the way. Out of respect for you and our former relationship, I will make sure to be next in line in the gymnasium. Then I will remain your servant so I can always be near you.&quot; He kisses my forehead before standing up to pick up his backpack. I stand up myself peeling off my sticky bare butt off the seat. Once I stand, McKelly opens the doors and everyone on the bus except for Derek stands at attention. Derek holds his hand out to me &quot;Come with me, My Queen. I&#39;ll escort you to the gymnasium.&quot; I take his hand and he walks me out of the seat, down the steps, and off the bus, my huge breasts bounding with each step. Once in the open sunlight, I take a look around. Lining my path to the entrancestors to school are men, hundreds of men. &quot;Derek who are they? And why are there no women?&quot; &quot;Those, my Queen, appear to be eager males waiting to do their duty. As only men can sire you children, your female subjects have been delegated to various service and management roles to run the kingdom, under your guidance of course. Come, lets get you to Lord Kyle so that your reign can begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek leads me past my adoring masses and into the building, where even more subjects wait. The crowds from outside have been organized into a single file line and are being attended to by female students and teachers. As I pass them walking down the hall to the gym, they all start applauding, cheering &quot;Long live Queen Jennifer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing all of these people cheer with such joy for me almost makes me forget why I&#39;m here; to be a baby factory for these people. How can they be okay with this? How is this legal? Why am I still walking to the gym? The only answer is the curse. We can&#39;t fight it. Derek and I pause before the large double gym doors. &quot;I can&#39;t fight this, can I Derek?&quot; &quot;No my Queen.&quot; Just as I figured. &quot;Well I guess I have to go through with this. But I won&#39;t be happy about it.&quot; And I push through the double doors with gusto to my fate.</p>
