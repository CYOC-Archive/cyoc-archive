<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Why won&#39;t you marry me Duncan?&quot; Esmeralda cooed as she climbed onto Duncan&#39;s stomach. &quot;What&#39;s the matter? Are you not man enough for me?&quot; she asked in a tone that was both sexy and laced with dark intentions.<br />
<br />
Duncan looked her in the eyes peering into her wild soul for the briefest of seconds. He admired the untamed, radiant beauty she exuded. &quot;I doubt any man is.&quot; he casually mentioned with a floor shaking, matter of fact, sincerity that made Esmeralda stop breathing for a second and turn bright red though Duncan didn&#39;t see. Duncan raised his hand and gently caressed her breasts as though she were a porcelain doll feeling every crevice in her nipples and every curve of her flawless skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 16. I am not even allowed to see you naked, let alone have sex with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Esmeralda had felt Duncan&#39;s penis rising against her back, &quot;What? you mean like this?&quot; she asked mounting him in a single swift move that both shocked Duncan and drove him immediately mad with lust.<br />
<br />
As soon a they both came, Esmeralda lied next to Duncan and immediately asked, &quot;You were saying?&quot; which left Duncan confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why won&#39;t you marry me?!?&quot; She growled angrily, punching Duncan in the ribs, which hurt quite a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;OW! Cause you&#39;re abusive. Jeez. Why do you have to get married now? How old are you anyway 17-18?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be 20 next month&quot;, she said with a deep sadness. &quot;in my culture I should be married with a one and a half year old child by now and have another on the way. If I am not wed and with child within 13 months, I will be cast out of my family for being cursed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus!&quot; Duncan said shocked. &quot;That&#39;s extreme.&quot; After a brief pause, &quot;In my culture people finish high school, and in some cases, college before they think of getting married. Its also customary for the guy to be a few years older than the girl. I feel awful about your situation, but this is a cultural issue for both of us. Even if I were to run away with you, there would be a search party because I&#39;m still a minor, you are considered an adult and would be in bigger trouble. I can&#39;t even legally marry you without parental consent until I&#39;m 18 and my parents would never agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Esmeralda visibly shrunk, she thought it was a matter of convincing him but there were so many obstacles in their path. Lets be honest, she didn&#39;t care at all about the legal system, but his family, when she was doing this to maintain her family, that mattered to her. Even if that weren&#39;t the issue he seems to think she is to old for him to have a real relationship with. With that she began to cry.<br />
<br />
Duncan honestly felt terrible and he had decided that this is the first and last one night stand he intends to have in his life. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I wouldn&#39;t even know how to support us. And you would have to get pregnant, I&#39;m not ready to be a dad.&quot; he said caressing her trying to comfort her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, you&#39;re too young?&quot; Esmeralda sobbed bitterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes I most definitely am!&quot; Duncan exclaimed not understanding how she could think otherwise. &quot;But you are drop dead gorgeous, and beautiful (they both understood he was talking about her spirit), and you will have no trouble finding a good man who is strong, handsome, and would make a great father to the beautiful son or daughter he will give you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already have.&quot; She said with a fierce determination that surprised him. In a flash she was on top of him again writhing and moaning.  <br />
<br />
Having already gone at it several times, the muscles were sore from being in this position so Duncan took the initiative to move, which surprised Esmeralda. A moment later she began softly saying, &quot;come on, don&#39;t give up on me now, work!&quot; This quickly escalated to screaming phrases, &quot;Do this for me! I need it! Make it happen!&quot;  which Duncan thought was her way of spurring him on, so he went at her with everything he had.<br />
<br />
It felt like lightning shot through his spine and radiated throughout his body. In that exact moment they both came simultaneously and neither held back. Duncan roared out yelling as loud as he could. Esmeralda did the same but at a higher pitch. They were both exhausted and ready to sleep. <br />
<br />
Esmeralda got up and went to the bathroom. Duncan didn&#39;t hear a flush and thought that was odd but was about to fall asleep and really didn&#39;t care. She pulled off the covers and grabbed his cock, still coming down. &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m not ready for more, maybe tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHH&quot; she said as she worked the last bit of his semen up the shaft and collected it in the plastic drinking cup the motel provided. Duncan kept his eyes closed, this felt very awkward, but didn&#39;t know if this was a normal thing people did, or maybe just gypsies. She let him rest after that so he didn&#39;t really care what she was doing. Within a few moments he was asleep.<br />
<br />
She looked at the clock on the rooms microwave, 11:27, &quot;Damn, too much foreplay.&quot; She went to her purse grabbing a vial of whisky putting a shot into the cup and downing the rest. She quickly dressed and grabbed the room key slipping out of the room like the wind.<br />
<br />
The only magic Esmeralda focused on learning, was what she deemed to be the most powerful, sex magic. There are countless types of magic but she was planning for this day, and abstaining, with much difficulty, to ensure she could pull off even the most powerful spells in her repertoire. She had been casting minor love spells on him all night but she hadn&#39;t anticipated he would have such compelling reasons to not run away with her. She needed to obliterate those reasons and marry him or her family would sever her ties with them by the time she turns 21,  <br />
<br />
During their last romp, Esmeralda was calling for the strength of her ancestors to grant her power for a very powerful spell. It gave an edge to the clan with the most children when tensions were high and a fight seemed imminent, which is part of why the clan focuses on its women having children so young. Most of the men leave the caravan when they find a mate, and seldom return. The woman stay with the caravan with the children and their mate has little choice but to join if they ever want to see their offspring again. Esmeralda knew she was pregnant, or going to be, it was the way of her people. <br />
<br />
She felt the surge of power being granted after she called out, that combined with the coming pregnancy, and it being the day she first had sex would grant her the power to cast the spell, until its no longer the day of her first time. The triumvirate of power sources is what stabilizes the spell, without that, it would fail, backfire, or become a runaway curse, which contrary to popular belief, they do try to avoid.<br />
<br />
She had his essence, now she needed to find the right ingredients to represent what she was looking for, from his perspective. What would  Duncan see as a representation of adulthood that would fit into this cup? Similarly, strength and knowledge were her targets, all things that he had mentioned were blocking him. The whisky itself represents social lubrication... the spell needed a few drops but but she put well over a shot in. The rest of the word will not notice the changes and he might be pretty accepting of them too.<br />
<br />
In the motel parking lot she saw a few men chatting, drinking, and smoking by a couple motorcycles. Now wasn&#39;t the time for hesitation. &quot;Hello boys!&quot; she cooed immediately grabbing their attention. &quot;I hate to interrupt but I am really short on time to find a few ingredients.&quot; <br />
<br />
The men looked at one another and one of them piped up, &quot;The only ingredients we got is beer, and we just barely got enough to go around, sorry miss.&quot; As he said this he kicked the nearly full 30 pack of beer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully, that&#39;s not the type of ingredient i&#39;m looking for.&quot; she flashed a winning smile. &quot;What represents being a man to you? Not a child, a boy, a teen, but a man... and here&#39;s the catch, it has to fit in this cup.&quot; she held the cup up so they could see.<br />
<br />
&quot;My motorcycle!&quot; the first one said, &quot;She&#39;s manly!&quot; Esmeralda smirked to herself realizing tobacco wasn&#39;t the only thing he was smoking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, Your motorcycle wouldn&#39;t fit in the cup, and you aren&#39;t willing to give her a piece of it to go into a cup! Which is what she&#39;s looking for.&quot; the second one chided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; the first responded clearly not getting it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know,&quot; said the second. &quot;Alec&#39;s male pattern baldness is a man thing. it usually doesn&#39;t happen in teens, at least not as advanced as he has it.&quot; the second guy said, clearly trying to get under Alec&#39;s skin.<br />
<br />
Alec scowled, &quot;Absence of something isn&#39;t able to be put into a cup. Mark&#39;s beard, screams old man to me. especially the parts turning grey.&quot; He said with an evil smile, getting his friend back in turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will do perfectly!&quot; Esmeralda chimed in. &quot;May I have a grey beard hair?&quot; She smiled sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, what&#39;s this even for?&quot; Mark asked puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;An innocent little spell I need to cast on my boyfriend by midnight.&quot; She purred back mysteriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Are you gonna turn him into a frog?&quot; Jim asked chuckling. &quot;Frogs are cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not. That wouldn&#39;t get me what I want. I need him to be more manly, like you.&quot; She directed her gaze at Mark. &quot;What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can find it, its yours.&quot; Mark turned his head so the streetlamp would reflect off his face. &quot;Good luck though, I&#39;m not even thirty yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
She found it immediately but feigned difficulty to spare the mans pride. She carefully dropped it into the cup after several tries and four or five brown beard hairs. Each time she whispered, &quot;Grow this.&quot; as she dropped the hairs in trying to direct his interpretation of the item.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! Thank you boys! When a guy thinks of strength what goes through his mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rock&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;, &quot;My truck&quot; they each responded separately.<br />
<br />
&quot;A rock will do, and any ideas for knowledge? or being able to provide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec offered, &quot;library, school, or maybe a book, a large denomination of money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A quiz that you got an A on.&quot; Mark offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Words!&quot; Jim said slowly and intensely like it was a deep and meaningful answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, thanks guys!&quot; Esmeralda called continuing her search.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck, you have 20 minutes till midnight!&quot; Mark called back with a light chuckle.<br />
<br />
Esmeralda ran to a nearby gas station, you never know what you will be able to find, and competency was a difficult word to express with an object that is smaller than the palm of your hand. She only had a few dollars and even fewer minutes. Racing through all the non food items she found some magazines and a hot-wheels toy truck which Alec thought represented strength. Going through the magazines she  found one on travel, one on science, and one on wealth management. None of the magazines would have any chance to fit in the cup. Glancing around she found a pocket dictionary which could be torn to shreds to fit...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; The dictionary was so boring, wealth management was a specific skill and lifestyle that could really help her family have solid ground to work off of....<br />
<br />
She grabbed the wealth management magazine, the toy muscle truck she found, and a travel coffee mug she saw. She quickly made the purchase. As she stepped back outside she quickly transferred the contents of the small cup into the coffee mug begging the spell to accept the new vessel and she threw the dinky cup away after making sure she got all she could from it. She tore into the packaging for the truck and whispered, &quot;Be as strong and capable as this.&quot; as she gently set the small metal truck into the mug.<br />
<br />
Finally, with a violent flourish, she ripped the cover of the magazine off and crumpled it up, &quot;Know all about this and more&quot; she said not sure how to use this icon to represent college education.<br />
<br />
Esmeralda estimated she still had 10 minutes if she was lucky. She ran back to the room and slipped back inside just as quietly as she left. The microwave said she had two minutes left. She maneuvered over to Duncan and put the cup up to his mouth to catch his breath. Nothing was happening she plugged his nose. There was a tense silence for several seconds. Duncan suddenly sharply inhaled and exhaled through his mouth directly into the cup. Its contents glowed faintly, the binding was completed.<br />
<br />
Esmeralda set the mug down, undressed and climbed into bed. She tried to not worry about the microwave time being set wrong or getting the object representations wrong. She will know soon enough.<br />
<br />
(Author&#39;s note: I know this chapter is huge, relative to many additions on this site, and I appreciate you taking the time to get this far! I tried to leave countless places for you to not be locked down, much of the transformation setup was from Esmeralda&#39;s POV so I explained her intents surrounding what she chose, but everything is based on Duncan&#39;s understanding of it. The silver hair could make Duncan think of his father specifically and leave him as a teen feeling ready for fatherhood, or he could see the truck as a just a toy and regress to an age he feels he should be playing with it. The extra whisky could be treated like a spell component and trigger alcoholism, or make him exactly 21. The discarded spell vessel may still be active, would a discarded lottery ticket turn him into a compulsive gambler, or a cigarette butt turn him into a smoker? What if he grabs the mug tomorrow morning and fills it with coffee before Esmeralda can stop him? If Duncan does age or regress, at what rate does it happen, what are Duncan&#39;s responsibilities, was the whisky successful at making the world accepting of Duncan&#39;s changes? My point is, don&#39;t feel trapped!)</p>
