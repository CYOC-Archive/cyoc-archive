<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex’s lion butt sticks out the door to the bathroom as the horrid sound of hacking animal coughs and splashing bile sounded from inside. Colin waited outside right by her rear, wincing each time he heard her vomit splash into the toilet bowl. Eating so much food so fast… he knew it was a bad idea, and turning into an animal probably didn’t help her keep it all inside. All he could do was watch as her body tensed and swayed drunkenly, his trans-sister-turned-lioness finally lifting her head out of the toilet, panting with slimy strands of drool running down her lips. Whatever lustful drunkenness she had from right after she changed was gone. The honeymoon with her new body was over, replaced with the cold, hard reality of what such a violent transformation did to her. Back to normal, sans the old body.<br />
<br />
“Water…” Her voice rumbled queasily, her head turning towards her brother for help.<br />
<br />
“W-water? Right!” Colin jolted into action, squeezing into the tiny bathroom as he grabbed a cup from the sink to fill it with water. He carried it over to her, only to realize that maybe cups wouldn’t really work on a big feline maw like she had.<br />
<br />
“W-wait.” The thirteen-year-old took a step back towards the sink again. “I’ll just leave it running, you can reach this, right?”<br />
<br />
He twisted the faucet handle and plugged the sink, letting the water pool up inside as Alex’s body repositioned. With a sudden heave, her front end leapt up off the shower mat, her haunches swinging to the side striking Colin in the chest like a wrecking ball!<br />
<br />
“Oof!” Colin cried out as he toppled to the floor, his hands hugging his chest like he’d just been shot! It was clearly an accident, but it felt like he’d just taken a blow from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Colin bit his lip to distract from the pain, crawling back away from Alex until he was a safe distant away from that hulking mass of lion muscle. He nursed his wound for a moments before noticing his sister’s feline visage staring down at him, mortified.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God. I’m so sorry.” Her voice rang out, unencumbered by animal vocal cords. She sounded a bit different too. When she was human, she tried to imitate a girl’s voice. It wasn’t bad, but it was clear it wasn’t hers either - there was a lot of effort behind it, you could just tell. But now, it sounded clear and natural, just like Nadia’s in the Lion Prince movie.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t mean it…” Colin managed to say through the pain, trying his best to act tough. “You’re a lot bigger now than you were though…”<br />
<br />
That response didn’t seem to help, the lioness’s face growing even more worried as she peered down at him from between her forelegs. Colin couldn’t stand it. He fought through the throbbing pulses of pain on his chest and righted himself back up on two feet using the rim of the tub for support. This felt a little bit better. He could breathe easier now at least. Looking down at his chest, nothing seemed broken, but the skin looked really raw and red.<br />
<br />
“See? I’m tough.” Colin forced a smile, patting Alex on the furless lion flank, “Don’t worry. It didn’t really hurt that much. You just surprised me is all.”<br />
<br />
Alex still held a skeptical expression on her face, but she nodded nonetheless, dipping her head back down in the sink. Colin heard her bite and slurp and lap, as if she was trying to figure out the best way to drink with her new anatomy. He thought about it. There must be a litany of things she’d need to relearn like this. Things as basic as walking and jumping and drinking had to be totally different now that she was on all fours.<br />
<br />
The boy kept stroking Alex’s flank, feeling that mass of muscle that had swung into him. When Colin thought of a hairless cat, a Sphinx cat is what would come to mind, a little feline with wrinkled, sagging flesh, a tiny and shivering thing in comparison to their fuzzy counterparts; but Alex wasn’t anything like that. Her felid skin was full-bodied, nice, and smooth as he ran his palm against the curvature of her bulbous upper leg, that glossy sheen of sweat slickening his hand like baby oil. Without her lion fur, she didn’t seem any smaller than she’d be if she had it, her musculature stretched her skin taut into a supple feral hide. She was quite a bit smaller than the lions he’d seen before at the zoo, but she was for sure a bona fide big cat.<br />
<br />
Colin’s Mom used to tell him that you could never train something like a lion to be a pet, that no matter how nice they seemed at one point, they could always snap. Maybe it wasn’t that they’d snap, maybe they’d just forget their own strength and accidentally hurt someone. Hopefully that was the case, cause the thought of Alex snapping… going feral… well… if that happened, he’d be a goner for sure.<br />
<br />
Sure, she seemed fine now, but she wasn’t changed all the way yet either. What if she changed too much? What if she became too much of a lion? Was… this whole Yiffr transformation thing a good idea?<br />
<br />
Colin’s hand idly ran along the lioness’s rear as he contemplated the darkest things that could go wrong, the feeling of something crusty clinging to her skin suddenly pulling the boy back from his worried thoughts.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, blood. God, he almost forgot about that. How her tail came out of her rear with an explosion of blood. The remnants of it were everywhere back there in dark crimson clumps of brittle crust. Colin dipped over to the sink to grab a washcloth, wetting it before traveling back to her rear.<br />
<br />
“Hey, can I umm….” The boy didn’t know exactly how to phrase it, washing his sibling’s rear was a weird thing to ask to do. Alex seemed to get the picture though, swaying her rear into Colin’s hand. She was considerate this time, clearly trying to avoid knocking him out like she did just minutes before.<br />
<br />
Once he got her consent, he began working, dampening that dry, blood-caked flesh with the moist washcloth before scrubbing the red away. Fortunately, it all gave way rather easily. As he started around the base of the tail, he was happy to see there wasn’t any scarring despite that violent growth he’d witnessed during her transformation. It’s like the skin sealed itself up instantly after her tail burst free, the hair-less lion flesh as pliant and full as if she’d been born with it.<br />
<br />
Alex’s tail hiked up a little from the attention, but the newly formed lioness didn’t seem to pay Colin’s scrubbing any mind. She kept on drinking as the water in the sink refilled, the animal trying to rehydrate after purging the contents of her belly.<br />
<br />
Colin did as much as he could from one side, ready to climb in the tub to get behind her until he suddenly noticed something just above her tail that wasn’t quite coming off. It was some sort of black mark on her skin buried under that crust of dried blood. Her skin was blemish-less save for that weird mark, so he kept trying to get rid of it all, scraping off all the red from up there until he finally realized what it was.<br />
<br />
It looked a little off since the human skin that it was made for got stretched out quite a bit when she changed. It was still pretty easy to make out the shapes though now that the area was free of blood. Two floral sways were etched into her flesh, with an elongated heart tattooed in the middle. A butt tattoo? Wait, those were called “tramp stamps”, right? Colin had seen something like this when he’d looked up naked girls on the Internet before, but he’d never imagine seeing one on Alex. It laid anchored there even after her skin changed, a memento of her previous body as a different species. Maybe there was a lot Colin didn’t know about his sister.<br />
<br />
But she was busy, what with trying to figure out how her lion body works. As long as she wasn’t human, maybe it was too much to ask about human things. He finally climbed into the tub so he could reach the rest of her. He washed her haunches, her tail, and her legs cleaning as much as he could before finally having to bring up the big starfish starring him in the face.<br />
<br />
“Can I clean your, umm…” Colin paused, not sure how to put this request either. “… I mean, it’s got a lot of dried blood on it… your… umm…”<br />
<br />
Without even looking back, Alex’s tail whipped down, bopping her brother in the head like a flyswatter. That hurt more than he’d expected, even her tail was too muscular for its own good. He rubbed his scalp for a moment before taking a deep breath before diving in to do the weirdest thing he’d ever been asked to do for anyone ever.<br />
<br />
He wet his washcloth on a dribble of warm water from the tub before raking the damp fabric across that pouty mound of tail hole. It looked like it got the brunt of that gush of blood, Colin peeling off little castings of crimson crust as he felt that ridge of cat butt take shape. He’d never gotten a good look up someone’s ass crack before, but since his sister’s new lion haunches pulled her butt apart a bit, it was clear as day… and clearly different than it must have once been. It was a fleshy pink – an animal pink, a shade that didn’t look human, more like the color of chewing gum. And it felt a little gummy too, the shape of that muscle giving way as water from the cloth dipped inside, a light squelch slopping from the center until its shape reformed like a tight silicon tube. Colin prodded it a few times with the fabric, nudging with his finger once it was clean. It was mesmerizing, that doughy anal ring smooshing under his finger, pressing into him as her sweaty hide lubed his skin with her musky scent.<br />
<br />
He expected a reprimand from the lioness, but it never came. He peered over her butt to find that Alex wasn’t drinking any more… she was just looking at herself. She turned her head from side to side, up and down as if she was inspecting every possible angle she could see herself in. Alex then opened her jaw slowly, wider and wider until she looked like a snake unhinging its jaw. A paw lifted off the side of the sink as a clawed digit probed the inside, nudging her gums, her tongue, possibly counting her razored teeth. She didn’t look annoyed with Colin or upset is she shit her mouth with a toothy “clack”, but she didn’t seem happy either. A blank, serious-looking expression just hung there. Something about what she was seeing just didn’t make her happy.<br />
<br />
Looking at her face reflected in the mirror, the boy got a sense it was time to stop, but her rear told a different story. Her rear butted backward as her supple haunches pressed into the rim of the bathtub. That tassel-tipped tail flagged higher and higher until it swung over her butt, wordlessly telling the boy that it was okay to keep going.<br />
<br />
Colin gulped, wondering if it really was, a shameful tension building in the boy’s pants as he leaned forward, pinching the pliant ring of lion tail hole with the washcloth, squeezing it a few times. Yep, just as soft and squishable as before, water droplets slurping off the wrinkled flesh towards the center, drawing Colin’s attention.<br />
<br />
The boy sheathed his finger in the warm washcloth, pushing it into the puckered middle as that muscle of anus hugged around his cloth-covered finger like a warm, rubbery clamp. There were still a few hints of the dried blood buried deeper, just insight the puckered part of that tight sphincter that Colin could spot. The boy tugged his finger out, feeling that anal ring hung along with it the whole way. Just as plunged it back to finish off the last of the grime, he felt Alex’s rear wiggle. Then it shook. A rumbling growl vibrated the finger inside, signaling that maybe play time was over!<br />
<br />
He pulled his finger back, only to feel the muscles inside squeeze against it like a Chinese finger trap! Through the mirror, he watched Alex’s feline face contort into a feral scowl, her teeth barring as she huffed out a guttural snarl.<br />
<br />
Colin felt as panicked as a mouse. He pulled back, tugging with the full weight of his body, almost stretching her tail hole to a prolapse! Skin flexed. He felt like his finger would come off! But he came loose, tripping into the tub before as he slammed his back against the tiled wall. He peered up at her face reflected at him through the mirror, wondering if the worst was going to pass, whether Alex was still there or whether she was going to maul him like a bunny rabbit for what he did!<br />
<br />
But it did pass. After one final shudder, her face in the mirror dipped down, a string of drool leaking into the sink as the looked at herself again, taking long, deep, open-mouthed pants of steamy breath.<br />
<br />
Relieved but shaken, Colin stepped out the tub and stood beside the lioness, just looking at the mirror with her. He felt he needed to say something about, well… all of that. But what the hell could he say?<br />
<br />
He just stood there, starring along with Alex at the two of them.<br />
<br />
They used to look so similar. Their hair color was the same dusty blonde, and his mom always told him that he was the spitting image of Alex when she was his age. Even when she was starting to try to look more like a girl, she couldn’t escape the resemblance, and it seemed frustrate her back then too. She really, desperately wanted to change how she looked, but no matter what she tried it never satisfied her.<br />
<br />
But now, it was just boy and beast. Was she happy now? Colin studied her face. Her quirks that he’d picked up by living with her all his life had to be there, just buried inside that new animal face of hers.<br />
<br />
“Colin.” She finally spoke. “Am I a girl?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, totally!” Colin answered instantaneously.<br />
<br />
She didn’t respond as fast as he did, her broad feline eyes still starring at herself, drinking in the endless wonder of what her face was now – what it meant. Colin had caught her doing it before when she was human. She did it a lot.<br />
<br />
“Colin…” Alex’s voice droned in monotone. “… be honest. I just need to know…”<br />
<br />
Colin never heard her like this.<br />
<br />
“Do you deep down think I’m a girl. A girl… like…” Her voice cut off, she didn’t seem to even know what she meant. Alex’s claws bared against the porcelain sides of the sink, her claws unfurling. Tension growing. Frustration.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah! I do think you’re a girl! I do! I do I DO IDO I-“<br />
<br />
Colin stopped. Wasn’t that the right answer? He found himself suddenly grappling with her, hugging onto her foreleg as if he were trying to wrestle a gun away from her, trying to keep her claw planted down against the sink. He was trembling. She was too. Her paw felt tense, strained ligaments jutting out. And then her fangs dipped out between her black felid lips.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what… do you want me to say?” Colin whimpered like a mouse, his sister’s feline ears registering it as such.<br />
<br />
He shot a look into the mirror at that furless lioness face. Alex resembling a scary dog-headed dragon more than that pretty lion from the movie! Was she going to use those claws? Why would she even want to?<br />
<br />
“Why are you even asking me that…!?” Colin sputtered out, “I did what you wanted! I just want you to be happy! Isn’t that enough!? You’re a girl! I told you I think you’re a girl!”<br />
<br />
The sink shook. Those dagger-like claws scraped the porcelain he was gripping as Alex’s fearsome body dipped and thrust, a foul-breathed grunt piercing through her growling as she stiffened her body, dropped down, and pushed again and again. Colin didn’t understand it; his sister’s growling, that thrusting… but then he peered back towards her broad feral belly, and he saw it.<br />
<br />
The floor was wet. So was Alex’s feral tummy. A splotch of goo followed by a single strand of slime trailed upwards, ending at the tip of Alex’s human penis. It was extremely out of place on what his sister was now, hanging there on the lioness’s broad lower belly in a limp erection. What remained of her maleness slapped against her belly like he’d seen some stallions at a farm do, her hips possessed by a fierce need to relieve of herself as her whole body strained to masturbate her like an animal! Little ropes of sticky pearlescent cum oozed out Alex’s urethra, adding even more stains to the mess forming on the bathroom floor, until one final heavy thrust smacked her dick hard against her leonine tummy, spattering it with one last, thick rope of her human sperm.<br />
<br />
She yowled out a deep felid rumble as her back arched up in the air before suddenly going limp. Her paw relaxed in Colin’s hand. Her claws retracted. Her expression sunk into that trademark sad-smile of hers. She liked to wear it a lot when she was a human, and Colin could still see it clear as day on her leonine face.<br />
<br />
Her brother stayed where he was, grasping her paw, still gawking at the mess she’d made down there, wondering how long she’d been cumming for. He wondered whether it hurt due to that scowl and whether he caused it by cleaning her butt. Before he could ask his sister suddenly started to shift that huge feral form, her paws slipping from his grasp as she hopped down on all fours, shaking the entire room around him as she landed.<br />
<br />
Colin remembered - she was big, huge even, very capable of crushing him by accident. The boy didn’t want a repeat from last time, so he weaved under her neck and around her muscular shoulders, pressing himself on the far-end of the wall opposite the door. Alex didn’t really seem to pay her brother any mind, not bothering to speak a word of human speech. Instead, her attention was draw to that stubborn maleness still attached to the lion’s belly. She hiked up a leg like a dog about to lick at his sheath, her muzzle dipping down an inch away from it before she just seemed to stop and examine it.<br />
<br />
Her penis still hung there eliciting little half-hearted, flaccid bobs as her huge maw utterly dwarfed it in size. Pausing and inhaling deeply, she huffed it back out as a humid puff of lion breath, blasting her vestigial boyhood with it. It sprang up, splashing another squirt-gun-shot of semen against her black feline lips. Colon then noticed her small ovular human-boy balls precariously perched as tiny polyps dangling between her powerful feral thighs. They flexed and jostled too as Alex breathed another blast of lion-scented air against her cock, another splash of cum making wince as her body tensed up once again.<br />
<br />
Whatever she was doing, Colin couldn’t even guess. It wasn’t even clear if she liked this – if this even felt good to her at all. All Colin could gather was that little sensitive worm of flesh dangling from her lower belly was able to stupefy her. Each time it came, Alex seemed to tense up and rumble. A frustrated expression was chipping into her feral feline face as if what she was trying to do just wasn’t working.<br />
<br />
Alex was panting not like a molly cat in labor, her chest rising and falling with greedy intakes of breath. She was sweating even more, the air in the room growing sticky and raunchy with her distinct leonine stink. Colin watched her maw open up, teeth splayed like a bear trap before she lolled her long tongue out, the slender muscles dripping with steamy drool. She shook like she was trying to defuse a bomb, the tip of her tongue lolling out until it stroked the underside of her cock just slightly… and it exploded.<br />
<br />
Alex reared her head away from her crotch like she was just kicked by a donkey. Her claws retracted into full-length feline spears, the sharp tips screeching against the linoleum floor like nails on a chalkboard. She growled out a roar, eyes clenching tight. Colin saw that the lioness got sprayed in the face by her own cum, the tip of her muzzle absolutely dripping with the stuff. Muscles along her back flexed strong than a body builder’s as her whole form trembled, her cock still spurting out little flecks of human sperm as she rode out an intense orgasm.<br />
<br />
The room was quiet save for Alex’s deep, needy panting, the bathroom mirror and shower curtain fogging up as the musky stink of her sweat evaporated into the air. She seemed calmer, laying there prone as her she starred off into an empty corner of the room, but her demeanor looked completely feral. Colon couldn’t see the human-side of herself since her face was turned away. All he could see was her tail flicking here and there, a cat&#39;s way of saying she was frustrated with something. But what could she be thinking about? Why wasn’t she talking?<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes for Colin to feel safe enough to back away from the wall. He stood up as still as a tree, letting time pass as he wondered if Alex was in there… whether she was just a lion ready to pounce at the slightest disturbance. He knew she wouldn’t want to hurt him… but she just seemed so disoriented.<br />
<br />
Steeling his resolve, he reached a shaky hand out to stroke against his sister’s side, holding his breath as his fingers met beast skin. Her flesh seemed to tense right where he touched, Colin freezing in fright as he prepared himself for a claw to the face, but it didn’t come. A moment later she relaxed.<br />
<br />
The boy exhaled a sigh he’d been saving since she’d started getting all growly, his hand tentatively gliding up further and further until he was petting her where her head and neck met. He didn’t say anything… it was hard to think of anything to say after what had just happened, Colin just kneeled in a little closer, massaging that taut muscular neck of hers as he waited for some signal that Alex had returned.<br />
<br />
A shaky rumble vibrated from her throat as the lioness seemed to burp out a thick wad of saliva, like she was clearing her throat. Her head turned as the yellows of those marble-like eyes peered at him in her peripheral vision. Colin withdrew his hand, waiting for her to do… something.<br />
<br />
“Ooohhraaaww…” she growled, that feminine tonation returning through the fog of feral noises from her throat. “Thhhwaatt… thriing… It doewsn’t wanna go…”<br />
<br />
Her voice felt somewhat drunk, her words thick like she was trying to speak with syrup in her mouth. She had been drooling a lot, so it seemed that she was trying to clear it.<br />
<br />
“A thing that doesn’t wanna go…?” Colin asked, trying to be helpful. “Your penis… right?”<br />
<br />
“Yreaahh…” She spat with a groggy growl reverberating through her throat.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Colin said in a soft voice, “So much of you has changed… but that’s still there.”<br />
<br />
“It freeeels different though…” She murred, lazily kicking her hind leg back. “It’s feels like… it’s changing when I touch it. I just need to keep touching it… but I can’t… it’s too sensitive.”<br />
<br />
Colin wasn’t sure if it was possible for her to be changing now. From what he saw on the app, it seemed like her body only changed all at once after she ate enough meat.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but let’s just leave it be for now.” Colin suggested, a thwack from Alex’s tail startling her brother like a sudden crack of a whip. He must have annoyed her… yet she didn’t seem to want to attack him over it. She sighed again, droopily arching her head a little closer to her brother.<br />
<br />
“But… I just… need this.” She grimaced slightly, her movements slow, lethargic, and brooding. “Touch it.”<br />
<br />
Colin shook his head fervently. “I’ll clean you up a little… but I’m not going to touch your penis!”<br />
<br />
“Come on…” Alex slurred, forcing a purring, feminine voice. Her head arched gently, her broad cheek nuzzling against his. “You’ve got hands.”<br />
<br />
“It’s j-just…” Colin stammered, flustered by the nuzzling, “Y-you were acting all weird just then… and you still sorta are.”<br />
<br />
The boy didn’t know what to make of his sister’s lust hide against his cheek. It felt soft, slick, and sure; her head arching up higher and higher until the bottom of her muzzle suddenly hooked around his neck!<br />
<br />
It wasn’t painful, but it was forceful. She gently lowered her head, bringing her brother along with it, making Colin kneel down further before lying flat on his belly, his head suddenly squashed between Alex’s muzzle and the pads of her upturned lion paw.<br />
<br />
“You said you’d help me, right?” Her voice hummed in a feline purr on top his scalp, the lioness smooshing her brother’s face into that leathery, feral luciderm covering her paws.<br />
<br />
Colin tried to lift himself up but couldn’t. He realized if her claws suddenly flashed out, she&#39;d slice his face. That lion&#39;s grasp against his face could mean sudden death, but it felt nice at the same time.<br />
<br />
“I have limits!” Colin’s voice sprang out, lips muffled against his sister’s paw pads. “Just… don’t hurt me…”<br />
<br />
“You’re so strung up. Don’t worry.” Alex cooed, flicking her tongue out, lapping along his upper neck in a warm little grooming kiss. “I’m not gonna hurt you, dude.”<br />
<br />
Yes, he did worry. No matter how much Alex insisted, Colin couldn’t ignore the elephant in the room.<br />
<br />
“You’re my sister.” Colin mumbled as the big cat stroked his scalp with her cheek. “I’m not going to...”<br />
<br />
“You already played with my butt...” She purred, her felid lips pressed against his forehead. “And I’m not just your sister. I’m a cat. We like getting pet. It’s nice. It’s like… popping an ecstasy berry, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Like, the drug?” Colin tilted his head in Alex’s grasp, “No? I mean… do you?” That explained why she has so many T-shirts from rave shows. And the tramp stamp too… sorta.<br />
<br />
Alex groaned at herself, realizing she was giving away a little too much about her proclivities. “Jeez. Just don’t worry about all that stuff.”<br />
<br />
“You keep saying that! But you were all growling and scary and-” Colin’s voice halted, a sizzling hot gob of wet drool splorted against his scalp as her sister’s giant tongue lazily lolled out on top of him. Frothy dribbles of viscous spit smeared down onto his cheeks, her hot, over-ripe breath panting against him.<br />
<br />
“I was just excited is all…” Her voice trails off into a purr. One of her feral digits stroked along the underside of his chin as her lips kneaded all that drool into his cheek from the other side. “You were too.”<br />
<br />
“I swear I wasn’t…” Her brother’s denied it, his lips drooling against her beanbag like paws taking in their strange flavor as his sister lapped against his head. It was hard to deny this felt really good. The lioness’s tongue tickled him somewhere that made him cough out a giggle, Colin trembling as he tried to turn to face his sister, whimpering out in a queasy chuckle, “Alex… this is weird…”<br />
<br />
“Just relax.” She rumbled with a smirk, focusing on grooming the boy’s head with wet, sloppy feline kisses. Her voice deepened into a sultry mantra. “I’m a lioness now… I’m a lioness…”<br />
<br />
Her thin feline lips nuzzle up to his ear, pinching the lobe softly, letting out a distinctive “Rawr~”<br />
<br />
Colin’s confused cock got really hard, practically chiseling against the tiled floor. His skin was cherry red wherever Alex licked him. He felt strangely elated, but the tingling heat got so intense he just had to pull away.<br />
<br />
But she didn’t let him, clamping his head between her cheek and paw before returning to slathering drool over his face with that lurid tongue.<br />
<br />
“Just let me do this.” She rumbled with a growling purr, her voice starting to slur again as she wet her tongue with a viscous glob of leonine spit. “S-seriously. I need to.”<br />
<br />
“Need to what?” Colin laughed nervously. “You’ve got enough of a taste of me, right? I mean… I really think I need to cut you off!”<br />
<br />
“I need to… I need to…” The lioness lolled out a syrupy-thick lap of drool. “I… don’t know…”<br />
<br />
Alex’s voice grew a tiny bit manic, her tongue slithering along her brother’s cheek as she lapped across his face from chin to ear. “What’s wrong? Afraid of your big sister?”<br />
<br />
“I am of a lion!” The boy sputtered out as the tip of the lion’s tongue traced along the side of his mouth. At this point Colin couldn’t tell what she was doing. She seemed well beyond just playful licking at this point, that latent feral-ness feeling like it was starting to show. A dark thought erupted in the boy’s mind, making him wonder if she was actually going to lose it.<br />
<br />
She didn’t top licking him. Alex’s grasp was tightening a bit too much, she didn’t seem to pay it any mind though. The boy gasped as a razor tip of lion tooth grazed too-close-for-comfort across his cheek. Alex again didn’t seem to notice, the lion letting out another felid purr that vibrated down her tongue until suddenly a loud rumble caught them both off guard.<br />
<br />
It was her belly.<br />
<br />
Colin had enough. He ripped his head away from her grasp sensing things had gotten too real. The distant notion that she might lose herself and do something she didn’t mean to suddenly leaping up to the forefront of his fears.<br />
<br />
But through all that something in Alex wasn’t ready to stop. As she lost her grip on her brother that feral purr dug deep inside her throat until it unearthed a growl. Her head jut forward, trying to reach Colin as he cowered away. Even as he shoved against her neck, digging his fingers into her tough lion hide, that mass of beast didn’t let up, pushing against him. She clipped his arm hard against her muscular neck and the sink as Colin clutched his hand into a fist and hammered at her head to get her off!<br />
<br />
One hit, then another! Her feral gaze seemed to suddenly understand, shame spread in her eyes as a sudden burst of human-blue returned to her irises.<br />
<br />
She cowered away, backing her way out of the bathroom as she sat down on her haunches, obediently still as if she were a dog ordered to “stay”.<br />
<br />
Colin wretched open the bathroom door and slammed it, grabbing the phone with the Yiffr app, locking his sister-turned-lioness inside the bathroom. The last thing he saw of her was Alex sitting there on her haunches like a forlorn house cat, a spatter of shameful cum shooting out her erect prick.<br />
<br />
There was a delayed reaction, Colin’s heart pounding as he suddenly heard what sounded like a TNT blast plow against the bathroom door. The hinges buckled and screws creaked, but the door remained shut as he heard his sister trying to fiddle with the doorknob from the other side with her clumsy paws, the lioness abruptly coming to the violent realization she was trapped!<br />
<br />
“COLIN, PLEASE!” She screeched, her voice a mutated-cross between a human crying and a leonine bellow. “I’M SO SORRY, PLEASE, I DIDN’T MEAN IT!”<br />
<br />
Colin’s back was right against the door as he felt he weight slam against it again. She was tearing at it, claws audibly carving out slivers of wood as she pushed all her weight against it. Luckily it still didn’t give.<br />
<br />
“You were… really going to try to eat me…” The boy whimpered in a dazed monotone. He leaned against the side of the door opposite the lioness, still shell-shocked. “You really wanted to eat me… to get to the next stage of change… to change your cock… into girl parts...”<br />
<br />
“No! I didn’t, I didn’t-!” The lioness’s voice darted out instantly, first starting as a growl before shifting a shuttering female timbre. She rustled around on the other side of the door, movements less explosive but still trying to bust through. “I didn’t want to eat you! I was just really invested in, ugh, well… doing what I was doing – I just wasn’t ready to stop when you pulled away and I sort of panicked!”<br />
<br />
“What? Panicked about what? Panicked about… me getting away?” That didn’t make sense to Colin at all, adrenaline was still rushing through his veins, his heart was still pounding. He opened up her phone again, flicking to her Yiffr app, trying to make sense of what happened.<br />
<br />
“I told you I’d never hurt you! I mean – that one time I just wasn’t thinking, but I… I promise to think about it all the time from now on and-” She trailed off, Colin hearing a thump from the other side of the door as her head pressed against it, like she was listening to something intently. Through the sound of both their breathing, Alex’s phone made little rumbles and buzzes as Colin looked through the app, coming across a big red button at the bottom of her page the read “Revert Changes”.<br />
<br />
“NOUUR!” NONONO! NO! PLEASE!” Alex screamed from the other side of the door like she was getting electrocuted. She screamed like she knew exactly what her brother was looking at now – as if she knew exactly what was going to do.<br />
<br />
“Please! PLLLEAASEE! DON’T CHANGE ME BACK!” Her voice soared in a desperate plea. “I just don’t know what’s fucking going on, okay!? Just please! I’m so close to being a real girl! Please don’t make me go back yet!”<br />
<br />
Her voice dampened to a shuddering cry as she listened for a response, but Colin didn’t speak, he just starred at the button on the screen. All he had to do was press it and it all would go back to normal. It was right there.<br />
<br />
Alex’s body still pushed, tensing on the other side of the door as if she was preparing to be de-lion-ified at any moment.<br />
<br />
“I just don’t know… what’s going on with me!” She repeated, her brother feeling her trembling from the other side of the door. “It’s too much for me to think about all at once and I don’t know why I wanted to lick you so bad! I don’t even know if lion brains are hooked up right to think about all the stuff that’s going on in my head! Please, just wait.”<br />
<br />
Colin shrunk away from the door, taking a step back as he finally responded. “I mean… Okay… that part about things being hard to make sense of… makes sense…” He huffed out, a little tremble running down his spine as he prepared to defy his big sister. “But you’re big and scary now and… you’re acting wild.”<br />
<br />
“I-I know.” Came a sullen voice panting from the door, Colin hearing the lioness’s paws gliding down the wood, claws cutting against the door until she apparently was back down on all fours. “I really don’t mean it though. I don’t want to hurt you. I’m just not used to being this way yet! It feels so… good… like you wouldn’t believe…”<br />
<br />
“Alex…” her brother shuddered out a sigh, trying to inject a dose of reality. “Mom’s not going to accept a lion in the house. You’re going to need to change back sooner or later.”<br />
<br />
“I know… It’s just… I need to go all the way before I change back!” Alex begged, nudging her head against the other side of the door. “I’ll do anything, anything you want. I just want to be a girl… I just want to be Nadia…”<br />
<br />
“Alex, I told you. You’re a girl to me.” Colin reassured her in a sullen tone, “You don’t need to be Nadia.”<br />
<br />
That didn’t seem to help. She seemed to be sobbing, huffing in trembling gasps of air. Colin felt a tinge of sorrow wrinkle down his spine. She really wanted to be that lioness from the movie so bad, she must have wanted it for a long time, maybe since they were little kids. It would have been so much easier if she’d only just turned into something less ferocious and dangerous, but no. She NEEDED to be Nadia.</p>
