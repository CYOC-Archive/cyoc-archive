<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the way home, I came across 5 girls trying very hard to carry some heavy boxes into the house. From afar they looked familiar, but I didn&#39;t recognize them immediately, I still stopped and went to help them. I got out of my card, went straight to the one that was trying to lift the heaviest box and got on the other side saying &quot;Looks like you&#39;re having a hard time, I&#39;ll help you if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; Closer I realized that the boxes were large and I couldn&#39;t see the girl&#39;s face on the other side.<br />
<br />
When we finished loading the last box inside and put it on the floor I finally got more attention on who the girls were. The one who had carried the last box with me was none other than my ex-girlfriend Milly.<br />
<br />
&quot;At last we finish Milly. And thanks for the help, whoever you are.&quot; Said another girl, which I recognized and looking at her I confirmed that it was my sister Linda. She and Milly had been friends since before we started dating and stayed together even after we broke up. It was then that I remembered that Linda had warned that she would help her friend who was leaving her parents&#39; house with the move.<br />
<br />
It was a hot day and both Milly and Linda were wearing gym shorts and a tank tops.The shots of the two were rankings, but the Mill&#39;s top was pink and Linda&#39;s was blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not know he had changed so much to the point of my own sister to recognize me.&quot; I thought<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally we&#39;re done, I think we can relax a little now.&quot; someone said, it was Tina, one of my sister&#39;s friends, who was joining us in the living room. With her was Ursula, both wearing the same kind of clothes, with Tina wearing a green top and Ursula wearing an orange top.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, it really was harder than I expected.&quot; Ursula said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right girls, and I have exactly what we need here&quot; It was Grace, my sister&#39;s friend who was the new owner of this house. She was carrying a bag of drinks for them, Then she turned to me and said &quot;I don&#39;t know who you are but it was of great help, we were already planning to have a sleepover tonight, feel free to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care, but I have nothing to wear.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, I have some pajamas left, you can wear it.&quot; Grace said<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Now, can you tell me where the bathroom is, I won&#39;t hold much longer.&quot; I said more as an excuse to look at me in the mirror, I was wondering why they didn&#39;t recognize me. Seeing my reflection, I couldn&#39;t even recognize myself. In addition to my face taking on a more feminine shape, the color of my eyes changed from brown to blue.<br />
<br />
I returned to the living room just as Milly and Tina returned after receiving the pizzas that had been ordered. We all decided to eat, because we were all hungry after all the work.<br />
<br />
When we finished eating, we all put on our pajamas and went to the bedroom, where we talked about various subjects. Everything was going normally, until they started talking about sex. With that I started to look more at their bodies and my dick got hard. I put a cushion on my lap to hide my erection, which was unnecessary, as once I looked back at them I could see a tent forming in their pants, making it clear that a dick had grown in all of them, and they were all rock hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Linda, what&#39;s this in your pants?&quot; Tina asked, noticing the tent formed in Linda&#39;s pants, but hadn&#39;t yet realized the tent in her own pants, just like the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Linda said in surprise and, without thinking, she quickly took off her pants, exposing her new dick and balls to everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not possible, you grew a huge dick.&quot; Milly said, and I had to admit, but my sister&#39;s new dick was really big, bigger than Lilly and Alexis earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not the only one. Look, you also grew one.&quot; Linda said. All the other girls looked at their pants and then removed them, exposing their new dicks. <br />
<br />
Not to look suspicious I did the same as her and took off my pants too. I was a little surprised to see that my dick was bigger than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;But folks, I&#39;m thinking here, and I think having a dick shouldn&#39;t be a bad thing. Why don&#39;t we try them out before they draw a conclusion.&quot; Ursula said, stroking her dick<br />
<br />
So Linda went to Ursula saying &quot;It&#39;s a good idea, I&#39;ve always wondered what it is like to fuck like a man, and you&#39;ll be the first one I&#39;m going to fuck.&quot; Positioning behind Ursula she began to pass her dick through Ursula&#39;s ass, and in a misstep she eventually discovered that Urula still had her vagina. Discovering this, she scrambled between her own legs and found her vagina, then told everyone &quot;Cool girls, if you look just like us then I can confirm that we still have our pussies.&quot; By saying this she penetrated Ursula&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you guys, I have to fuck someone. Does anyone volunteer or do I have to choose?&quot; Ursula asked<br />
<br />
Grace then lay down on the desk and said &quot;Come, I&#39;m all yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then, Ursula went there, with Linda accompaning her, making all possible for her dick do not slip out of Ursula&#39;s pussy, and Ursula started to fuck Grace.<br />
<br />
While watching this I didn&#39;t realize what Tina and Milly were doing until she grabbed my arms and led me until I was behind Linda, and then they encouraged me to fuck her. I knew I couldn&#39;t counter them, especially Milly, that when she wants something it&#39;s almost impossible to make her give up. So I did it as a request and started fucking my sister.<br />
<br />
Soon after, Milly penetrated her dick in my pussy and started to fuck me. And finally Tina started fucking Milly. We did our sex train until we came.<br />
<br />
After this orgasm, all our dicks were still rock hard. Then we split into pairs, put ourselves at position 69 and started to blowjob each other. Me with Grace, Ursula and Tina, and Linda with Milly. <br />
<br />
We continued, cumming, shifting positions and fucking for about an houruntil we were all satisfied.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why we have a dick right now, but I can only say that I like it.&quot; Linda said<br />
<br />
&quot;And certainly not a small thing, to grow a stick in the six of us.&quot; Milly said<br />
<br />
&quot;To tell you the truth, I didn&#39;t get my dick here with you. I already had it when I arrived at this house, by the way, I&#39;ve had it since I was born.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;So you were born hermaphrodite?&quot; Grace asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither. It may be hard to believe, but I am Joe, Linda&#39;s brother.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;My brother? But you don&#39;t even look, it&#39;s hard to believe.&quot; Linda said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure no one will believe it if we say our dicks have grown out of nowhere.&quot; Ursula said<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, and for you to understand better I&#39;ll tell you what happened earlier at school.&quot; I said and then I told him everything that happened to Alexis and Lilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So does Alexis and Lilly have dicks now too.&quot; Tina said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s no use warming your head about it now. Let&#39;s go to sleep and tomorrow we&#39;ll discuss it.&quot; Milly said<br />
<br />
We all agreed, the day really had been tiring and we needed to rest.</p>
