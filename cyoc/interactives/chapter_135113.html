<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A buzzing phone put Kiki and Lindsey’s kissing on hold. Kiki reached over and picked up her phone. She took one look at who it was and snapped, “Ah hell nah.”<br />
<br />
“Like, what’s wrong?” asked Lindsey.<br />
<br />
“Mah boss is tellin’ me ta get mah big ass over ta work,” snapped Kiki.<br />
<br />
“But I thought you, like, got the day off and stuff,” said Lindsey.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but that don’t matter to that old frump,” grumbled Kiki as she grabbed her bikini top and put it back on, “She’s always tryin’ ta find excuses ta drag me ta work even when Ah ask for a day off.”<br />
<br />
“Then maybe you should, like, be more, you know, convincing?” suggested Lindsey mischievously.<br />
<br />
Kiki grinned and said, “Yeah, girl. Ah thank that old prude needs a new perspective of thangs.”<br />
<br />
Lindsey frowned a little and asked, “She’s not gonna be, like, your girlfriend, is she?”<br />
<br />
Kiki stroked the side of Lindsey’s face and said sweetly, “Course not, girlfriend. Ya know yer the only girl for me.” She kissed Lindsey’s lips, more softly and tenderly than she had been earlier. Just because she was a bikini dyke now didn’t mean she was incapable of a faithful and monogamous relationship. The fact that said relationship could only be with another bikini dyke didn’t matter.<br />
<br />
Lindsey grabbed her own bikini top and put it back on. “Well, you better get going,” she said, “Wouldn’t want Crab Cakes to get, like, crabbier.”<br />
<br />
“Right. Drop by and see me later,” said Kiki as she grabbed her things, “Ah think ya’ll like what we’ll do with the place.”<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
Kiki worked at a diner which was a bit of a greasy spoon on the outside, but it had enough regular customers to keep it running. Kiki had time to change into her work clothes before she got there. Though her clothes didn’t quite fit her altered body anymore, but Kiki made them work. Her shirt had too many buttons undone to be called modest and the skirt exposed far too much of her hips. Just bending forward slightly would expose her panties, or rather her bikini bottom. She didn’t bother with leggings, leaving her long luscious legs exposed.<br />
<br />
Kiki walked into the kitchen area and said, “Ya know, when a girl asks for a day-off, she usually means the whole day.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m too shorthanded for the lunch rush,” snapped Francine, the manager/cook of the diner.<br />
<br />
Kiki glanced through the window to see an empty diner. “What lunch rush?” asked Kiki, “There ain’t nobody here.”<br />
<br />
“There will be. And if you want to keep earning money around here, you’ll be working here instead of lying on your big ass on the beach all day,” snapped Francine.<br />
<br />
Kiki snorted. That was rich coming from Francine, or ‘Fat Fran’ as she was often called. The woman had a serious thyroid problem, being as wide as two normal women. A hip check from her would probably knock a guy into the next state. It was no secret that another reason she was so round was that she had a bad habit of binge-eating when she was upset, which was pretty often. If that weren’t bad enough, her redheaded complexion meant she had so many freckles that it looked like she had some type of pox.<br />
<br />
But Kiki wasn’t going to hold Francine in contempt, because she knew what Francine’s real problem was. The main reason she had such a bad attitude towards Kiki was because she was jealous, pure, green-eyed jealousy. Kiki might be working in this diner, but it was only a matter of time before some magazine people asked her to model for them. And Francine would be stuck working in the kitchen for the rest of her life. So Kiki wasn’t going to hold it against her, especially when she could do Francine a favor.<br />
<br />
“Bet yer wishin’ you could be takin’ a day at the beach,” said Kiki.<br />
<br />
“That’s none of your business!” snapped Francine.<br />
<br />
“Sure it is. Cause little ol’ Kiki’s gonna do ya a big favah,” said Kiki. Before Francine could react, Kiki grabbed her shoulders and planted a big kiss on her lips.<br />
<br />
Francine pushed Kiki away and spat. She furiously scrubbed at her lips, but the lipstick was already setting in place. “What did you do that for, you stupid cunt?!” snapped Francine, “I’m gonna fire you so hard…so…hard…” Francine’s eyes crossed as a strange expression came over her face, “So…hard…to…think…” she said in a dazed voice.<br />
<br />
Kiki watched with interest as Francine’s body started changing. It began losing fat at a colossal rate. Her pillow-like arms were slimming down a lot as her pudgy fingers grew a little longer and daintier, the nails becoming well-trimmed and covered in red polish. Her legs no longer rubbed against each other as they trimmed down. They also grew longer, giving Francine much-needed height. Her hips were becoming much smaller, no longer blocking doorways. As such, her pants could no longer stay up and fell down to her feet. Her panties didn’t follow because they had morphed into a pair of sky-blue bikini bottoms like Kiki’s. Her hips diminished until they were no longer monstrously-sized, but still very full and appealing. Her ass had also firmed up into a nice bubble butt. Her shirt draped over her body as her belly had lost a lot of fat. But her shirt didn’t slide off because her breasts didn’t shrink. Instead of being flabby sacks, they were now fully-round and perky, despite being so large. Her face was a lot better to look at, becoming like a supermodel’s, with perfect cheekbones and straight teeth. Her red hair spilled down her back all the way to her ass, looking a lot more luxurious than before.<br />
<br />
Francine, now Frankie, blinked as her eyes focused. “What was I thinking just now?” she asked, even her voice sounding more appealing.<br />
<br />
“Ya were thinkin’ about how hot ya were,” said Kiki.<br />
<br />
“I was?” asked Frankie, looking around before spotting her reflection in the fridge’s surface. “I am!” said Frankie excitedly before pulling off her ill-fitting shirt. It wasn’t much of a surprise that her bra had become a blue bikini top. Though the F-cup tits they now held were still very impressive. Frankie now had the body of a supermodel, her stomach showing nicely-toned abs. The freckles on her body had also diminished a lot. There were still some, but now they looked cute. “I’m really hot,” purred Frankie, posing in front of the fridge.<br />
<br />
Kiki was inclined to agree with her. If Lindsey wasn’t already her girlfriend, she would jump on the redheaded bombshell. But there was more than one reason for changing Frankie. “Wouldn’t it be great if everyone was as hot as us?” asked Kiki.<br />
<br />
“Sure it would,” said Frankie, “But how do we help them?”<br />
<br />
“Easy. Yer the cook here. Ya can put a little something in their food,” said Kiki.<br />
<br />
Frankie smiled and said, “I think I know just the thing.” Opening the fridge, she pulled out a half-empty jug of milk. She put it on the counter before removing her bikini top. She massaged her left nipple, making it grow harder. Eventually, she put the jug right up to her nipple. Squeezing her breast, she made a jet of milk squirt out of her nipple and into the jug. Frankie moaned as she milked herself until the jug was full. Putting the milk jug aside, she took a near-empty bottle of cream out of the fridge and filled it up with her right breast.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’ll do it alright,” said Kiki as she took the contaminated milk and cream.<br />
<br />
“And there’s plenty more where that came from,” said Frankie as put on an apron. She didn’t even bother with putting her bikini top back on. The apron provided just enough modesty that she could be seen but also allowed her easy access to her milky nipples.<br />
<br />
“Well, better get cookin’,” said Kiki, “There’s gonna be a lunch rush comin’ in.” With milk to put in any compatible meal and cream to add to coffee, it wouldn’t take long to change the diner’s customers into smoking hot lesbians. Kiki couldn’t wait for the first ones to change.</p>
