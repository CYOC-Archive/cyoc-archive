<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Marcy left, Lady started pacing back and forth.  What was she going to do?  She'd made an impulsive <br />
decision, once that she really hadn't given any thought to.  Now, she was trapped.<br />
<br />
It took only a short while before she decided she needed to get out of here, out of the house.  She needed to <br />
go out and talk a walk.<br />
<br />
Given that she still had her human mind, she was easily able to figure out how to open the back gate (it had a <br />
bad latch, a couple jumps were all that were needed to open it) and took off into the night.  Maybe she'd find <br />
the answer out there.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Two hours later, she was already regretting yet another impulsive decision.  <br />
<br />
She was tired and thirsty, and had somehow managed to get so far from home that she wasn't sure exactly how to <br />
get back.  And for that matter, with all her frustration with perhaps being stuck as a dog, she didn't really <br />
think about what running away meant.  The best case was getting found by someone and returned home and being <br />
stuck where she started.  Worse would be getting adopted by a family that didn't know she was once human.<br />
<br />
Worse would be getting stuck in the pound and put down as an unadoptable stray.<br />
<br />
She dearly wanted to return home, but felt like she was too tired to move. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you poor thing,&quot; she heard a woman say from not far away.  <br />
<br />
Lady stood, panting and tired while the woman approached quietly and gently.  She sniffed instinctually at the <br />
offered hand, finally giving it a friendly, tired lick.<br />
<br />
The woman took her home and gave her a bowl of water, which she drank greedily.  It turned out to be the home <br />
of three small children who fawned over the poor, lost dog.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we keep her?&quot; one of them asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's missing her collar, but she's owned by someone.  We need to figure out who she belongs to.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm missing my collar? thought Lady.  That doesn't make sense.  I didn't remove it.<br />
<br />
It was getting late, so the father of the house laid a few blankets along the wall of the living room, where <br />
she slept.<br />
<br />
** <br />
<br />
She fully expected to see Marcy in the morning, but she didn't.  The family put signs up in the neighborhood <br />
looking for her owners, but no one called.  In the meantime, she played with the children, feeling for the <br />
first time since right after the transformation happy with the dog body she now wore.  After a few weeks, the <br />
family stopped looking.<br />
<br />
She was given a new name by the youngest child, &quot;Goldie&quot;, and a new collar and tag.  She was taken to the <br />
groomer, given shots at the vet, and all the while spent each afternoon and often all day on the weekends <br />
playing with the children.  The few hours of solitude she was left with between the family leaving in the <br />
morning and coming back after school were spent resting, getting ready for play.  It had only been a few <br />
months, but she had long given up waiting for her old owner.<br />
<br />
The puppies weren't really planned by anyone.  No one was home when she discovered a stray neighbors dog in <br />
the yard.  The German Shepard had dug under the fence and was sniffing around.  She had gone out to <br />
investigate, and hadn't realized the strange feelings she'd been having were being in heat.  She forced the <br />
thought out of her mind almost until the moment she let the strange male take her.<br />
<br />
It would be weeks before her family realized what happened, but they rolled well with it.  As she grew, Goldie <br />
couldn't move as fast, but she could still play with the children.  Finally, she knew her time had come and <br />
with the family watching she gave birth to five large puppies.<br />
<br />
She allowed her instincts to kick in, grooming them and pushing them toward her teats for food.  The children <br />
were delighted.  Goldie could feel them nibbling at her teats, feeling a bond with them that she knew would <br />
only last a few weeks.  After all, these were puppies, not children.   Someone would adopt them after a time.<br />
<br />
She wondered if Marcy had planned this.  She wondered it several times until the day had arrived for the <br />
family to start adopting out the puppies and a familiar teenage girl showed up with her parents to adopt.  <br />
Goldie looked at Marcy and a knowing look passed between them.  They chose a female pup and left.  Goldie <br />
never saw Marcy again.<br />
<br />
Marcy, for her part, had been angry when Lady hadn't returned and had planned on leaving the dog at the <br />
strange house for a couple days as a punishment.  As time passed, though, and she realized that Lady was <br />
actually happy where she was, she was actually getting to feel loved as a dog, not just as a companion for a <br />
superbeing, she decided to leave her there.<br />
<br />
She felt just fine with that choice.</p>
