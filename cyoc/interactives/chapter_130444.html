<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edwin shook his head, his curly hair swaying with it. &quot;Nope, just thinking, that&#39;s all.&quot; Looking down at the soda, he decided to drink half, deciding that a day would be long enough to try this drink out.<br />
<br />
He began to drink, the flavor tasting like the best pink gum in the world as it went down his throat. The girl watched on, smiling along the way.<br />
<br />
Edwin finally made it to half the cup, then set it down on the nearest table, expecting the changes to happen. After a few minutes, he was dissapointed, nothing was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s taking so long!&quot; Edwin asked, but gasped after saying that. His throat suddenly felt weird, he knew something was up. His voice... it sounded different!<br />
<br />
The girl smiled, pumping her fist. &quot;That&#39;s great! Looks like you&#39;ve started!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin tried taking again, testing out his new voice. &quot;Wow, this feels really weird.&quot; It was definitely attractive, but also... kinda slutty.<br />
<br />
Edwin couldn&#39;t think for too long, though, as his dark tan skin began to change, now becoming that of a smooth white woman, all his body hair dissapearing, and his skin becoming free of all blemishes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, oh god.&quot; Edwin let out, the changes causing pleasurable feeling in him. He bit his lips, trying not to moan. &quot;Is it always like this?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl shook her head. &quot;No, it varies depending on which drink you chose! This one just happens to be one of the most sensitive ones we&#39;ve got!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin let out an involuntary moan, as the next changes started, his hands cracking as his bones changed, making his hands more feminine, nail Polish applying themselves. &quot;Could&#39;ve warned me, though-!&quot; He tried to say, but the next changes had begun.<br />
<br />
His arms, grew lithe and graceful, taking on a milky tone as his fingers grew long, thin, and beautiful. His shoulders had collapsed inwards, going from his moderately broad build to something that complemented the elegance of his changed arms. His hands were soft and gentle, now, completely feminine.<br />
<br />
The girl rubbed the back of her head. &quot;Sorry about that.... and I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;ll feel once this is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
The changes went to his chest next, Edwin&#39;s nipples swelling up as fat began building up behind them. Two mounds began to rise from his chest, growing larger and larger by the second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhh!&quot; Edwin moaned, his penis becoming erect, the pleasure becoming a lot for him.<br />
<br />
His breasts didn&#39;t stop, as the fat kept piling on, as his breasts pushed past B, then C, then D, then E, and then F cups. Edwin closed his eyes from the straight as his breasts began ripping through his clothes, stopping at an H cup.<br />
<br />
As the lighter skin tone swept ever upwards, his jaw narrowed while his cheekbones rose somewhat and his cheeks themselves filled out slightly, giving him a slightly rounder, much more attractivr face. His mouth shrunk down while his lips puffed up to a feminine, sexy shape.<br />
<br />
Finally, a weight built on his head as his hair grew out, longer and longer, until reached his butt. It felt almost ticklish as the black color it normally possessed was slowly overwritten, a shimmering gold passing through each and every strand from root to tip, leaving him gorgeous, thick locks that weighed heavily upon him. <br />
<br />
Edwin shook his/her head, noticing that the changes hadn&#39;t reached his lower body. But for some reason... that didn&#39;t matter to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, like, the top of me looks REALLY hawt.&quot; Edwin found himself saying much to his dismay. &quot;Ugh, why did I, like, say that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl moved to Edwin, rubbing his shoulders to clam him down. &quot;Ohh... I was afraid this would happen. It almost never does, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, like, what?&quot; Edwin asked, as his breasts sprung out to an I-cup, breaking through his shirt.<br />
<br />
While he had been talking to the girl, his waist had squeezed in itself, his stomach becoming flat and smooth. His hips had widened immensely, his butt filling out to a unique bubble butt. His legs had legthened, becoming sexy and toned, all that was left was his manhood.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Edwin nearly fell onto the floor from the pleasure coming from it. His moans turned to screams of ecstasy as his balls were sucked inside of him, turning into ovaries while his penis was sucked inside his new hole. He began to roll and wriggle as his penis was fully sucked in, and he yelled even louder than before as it inverted and became a virginal vagina.<br />
<br />
Edwin started to feel funny as estrogen poured into her system, making her brain start to change, she began to like boys, and she felt a strange wetness in her new parts when she looked at the men around her.<br />
<br />
Lastly, her IQ began to drastically drop, as she became as dumb as a doorknob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, whoa, seriously, that was so fun!&quot; She said, springing up and hugging the girl. &quot;But, like, I need some cock. Now, please.&quot;</p>
