<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I woke up the next morning, I half-expected that E.B. would still be there with me. But as I looked around my bedroom and found myself completely alone, I remembered what he had told me late last night. &quot;We&#39;re only halfway into the week now,&quot; he had said, &quot;so tomorrow morning I&#39;ll be back to being mostly rabbit, and you should still be basically human. I&#39;ll come back to find you after sunset. That&#39;s when we should both be in our were-forms again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was afraid to find out what &quot;basically human&quot; meant. I pulled away the covers to find a few patches of fur still sticking out of my skin - and a raging morning wood that still looked like a human penis. As I got out of bed and stood up, I could tell that I hadn&#39;t gotten much taller than I was last night. I hurried to the bathroom, wanting to take a look at myself in the mirror. But the mirror was too high up - I could only see the tips of my own ears. Wait, my rabbit ears were still there?<br />
<br />
I scrambled up against the piping of the bathroom sink, grateful that at least I probably wouldn&#39;t weigh enough to break anything by climbing on it. Hoisting myself up over the lip of the porcelain basin, I was greeted with a face that would never pass for a normal human&#39;s. Not only were my ears sticking several inches up off the top of my head, but my nose still looked like a little triangular slit on top of a bulbous, snout-like jaw. I could hardly be surprised that the whiskers I had noticed yesterday morning were still there, and a lot longer now. The part of me that was the least normal was the part that was hardest to hide.<br />
<br />
If I hadn&#39;t gotten an unexpected visitor last night, I would have been in a complete panic, seeing my humanity continue to slip away even in broad daylight. But now I knew this was only temporary. I climbed back down to the floor, then went and grabbed my phone to call in sick from work. &quot;I think I&#39;ll have to be out for the rest of the week,&quot; I explained. I cringed as I suddenly realized how high-pitched my voice was now. I tried to cover for it by shifting into the lowest tone I could reach, which still sounded like a barely-pubescent kid trying to impersonate his dad to get out of school. I was like that kid in more ways than one, I thought. Short. Bouncing off the walls with energy. Growing hair in unexpected places.<br />
<br />
And constantly, uncontrollably horny. As soon as the HR rep on the other end of the line confirmed my schedule changes and signed off with a bland &quot;See you on Monday&quot;, my attention turned back to the erection that stuck out on my nude body. Maybe this was the one part of me that <i>wasn&#39;t</i> getting any smaller. Now that I knew my body was changing on a set schedule, I didn&#39;t have to worry that giving into temptation would make the transformation accelerate. And since I no longer had anything else to do this morning, I could jack off all I wanted. So I did.<br />
<br />
As I reached for my penis, the image of E.B. crossed my mind. I immediately tried to think of something - someone else, so I could focus on the task at hand. But in that brief moment, my cock jumped to attention. And, despite my best efforts, the image crossed my mind again - E.B. just as he had appeared yesterday, standing over me in the moonlight. His fuzzy bare chest, and the lean but powerful muscles that could easily be seen through the fur. And that sheath, which I hadn&#39;t seen in action, but which definitely looked bigger than mine had been, when I had one...<br />
<br />
The thought made me uncomfortable. This was the rabbit-creature that had, inadvertently, turned me into another rabbit-creature. The last thing I wanted was to start falling for him. What I needed from E.B. was help getting out of this mess, not a crush that would make me want to descend further into it. Plus, beyond that, I wasn&#39;t gay. Or, at least, I had never been gay before this. Somehow, though, a change in my sexuality didn&#39;t feel quite as shocking as the change in my species. I told myself that this had to be only temporary, a part of my new anatomy that would disappear in a few days with the rest of it. As soon as Easter was over, I could go right back to striking out with ordinary human women.<br />
<br />
So I let that mental image of E.B. linger. I thought about his cock as I rubbed my own. I had no idea what his looked like, since it had been perfectly hidden away from me during our only meeting. But I knew, from firsthand experience, what had to be inside. The two memories quickly combined in my head, and I could easily imagine his big, red shaft snaking out of its sheath. Was it coming out to greet me?, I wondered. Then I remembered - this was my fantasy, of course it was there just for me. I let the imaginary version of E.B. take a few more steps toward me, until that cock was sticking out directly into my awestruck face.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I sat on the living room carpet, eyes shut tight to block out the reality of the situation, and stroking my penis until it became painfully engorged. I licked my lips in anticipation, only for my tongue to get caught on something. It was my front teeth, of course, which had grown dramatically and now practically filled my mouth. That made me think about something else filling my mouth. I imagined myself slowly taking that slick, tapering shaft into my muzzle, carefully maneuvering it under those big buck teeth of mine, and letting its whole impressive length stick into my throat. This was a fantasy, of course, so there was no gag reflex to worry about. I could just close my furry lips around the base of his cock and suck on it until it... until it...<br />
<br />
My eyes flew open just in time to see my own cock exploding, shooting a thick, sticky rope that I knew would be hell to get out of that carpet. I started to catch my breath, remembering that there wasn&#39;t actually anything obstructing my windpipe right now. And I felt a cloud of shame at my back. Not about masturbating at a time like this - that ship had sailed days ago. But I couldn&#39;t believe that I had let myself force the Easter Bunny, of all people, into such a perverted fantasy. Especially when I was supposed to be meeting him again tonight.<br />
<br />
The hours just flew by after that. The sun had barely even passed its highest point in the sky before my fur started to grow in again with a vengeance. At this rate, I was probably going to be covered in it all day before long. I was starting to think that maybe I was better off that way, instead of shifting back and forth all the time. I mean, I no longer needed to pretend to be fully human - I wouldn&#39;t dare to venture out in a public place again until Sunday had passed and this was all over. So why not just commit to it all the way for a couple days?, I asked myself, as though I had any say in the matter.<br />
<br />
This time, as the changes came in, I could watch them happen calmly - not freaking out about them, since I knew what was happening to me now, and not overwhelmed with frustrated sexual energy, either, since I had just spent that energy all over the carpet. I just sat still - well, as still as I could when the various parts of my body were moving themselves around - and let it happen, with no fear and only a little bit of arousal.<br />
<br />
My legs were shrinking slowly back into my body, getting shorter by the inch. My feet were changing shape - my heels pulled away from the floor and stretched back up along my leg until they started to look like knees pointing in reverse. Only the ball of my foot and the toes remained planted in the carpet, turning into paws as the fur grew in around them. My hands were getting some of the same treatment, the fingers receding into little furry stubs that had to be less than half of their previous length. At least they weren&#39;t devolving completely into paws, the way that my feet were. It was hard enough to open doors when I had to stretch my arms up to grab the handle - it would have been a lot worse if I was losing my thumbs, too.<br />
<br />
My stomach tickled as the fur came in all over it. I&#39;d always been a tiny bit overweight, but now those pockets of fat melted away into lean yet powerful muscle right before my very eyes. I was no chubby bunny - what I was becoming was a lithe and quick creature, one that couldn&#39;t afford to carry an extra ounce around on its lanky frame. But the whole proportions of my body were changing, too. What looked like a skinny beanpole at four feet tall suddenly filled out a lot better when it was squished down to three feet.<br />
<br />
When I felt the tingling changes work their way up to my neck, I hopped up off the floor and ran to the bathroom, climbing up onto the sink again so I could get a good look at my head in the mirror. Kneeling in the basin of the sink, which now was so large I could practically take a bath in it, I studied my new reflection. The awkward assemblage of human features and animal features that I had found myself with this morning was gone. In its place was a purely rabbit face that reminded me a lot of E.B. - not that I was narcissistic enough to be attracted to myself like I was to him.<br />
<br />
Still, I sat there and just stared at that face for a while, slowly getting used to the idea that this was just what I looked like now. The longer I looked myself over, the more I could spot the remnants of my human form that were still there - and not just the bits that separated a were-rabbit from an ordinary, four-legged bunny. My dark brown eyes were roughly the same size as they normally were, which made them look huge when they were set in a much smaller head. I knew that E.B.&#39;s equally big eyes were a bright blue - I could easily remember the piercing way that he looked at me. My hair had been reduced to a tuft of slightly longer fur that fluffed up in between my tall ears. E.B., I was pretty sure, didn&#39;t have anything like that on top of his head, so I concluded that it must be another tiny hint at what I normally looked like.<br />
<br />
I could have gone on and on examining myself like that, but I was interrupted when my long and sensitive ears twitched at a sound that even they could just barely pick up. There was something rustling in the grass just outside the house. My heartbeat instinctually picked up its pace - and at my reduced size, it was already a lot faster than normal - even though I was pretty sure I knew who it was. I wondered how long I&#39;d been sitting there in that sink - was it really already getting to dusk? I realized that it <i>had</i> to be close to sunset by now, if my changes were already reaching their climax and leaving me fully were-rabbit. I began to contemplate how, exactly, I should get down from the now-dizzyingly high bathroom counter without hurting myself.<br />
<br />
Before I could figure that one out, though, I heard a clattering sound that made my pulse jump again, then a voice that sounded like it was coming from directly below the floor tiles. &quot;Hello? Human guy? ... Buddy? Are you home?&quot; It was E.B. - he must have clambered through the basement window again. I relaxed a bit, telling the high-strung herbivore part of my brain that the noise was from somebody I could trust - I think. &quot;I&#39;m up here!&quot;, I called down to him, noticing as I did that my voice had become even squeakier and higher-pitched than his was. I listened as his feet softly thumped against the concrete, eventually finding the stairs, making his way up to the hallway just outside my wide-open bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there you are,&quot; he said as he strolled into the room. &quot;I guess you wanted to see yourself in that big reflective pond-thing up there on the wall. Don&#39;t worry, bud, you look adorable. Just like an Easter Bunny should. But I could&#39;ve told you that.&quot; I stepped away from the mirror, a little embarrassed at having my intentions read so easily, and a lot more humiliated by meeting up with the very creature I&#39;d been having such inappropriate thoughts about. I mentally pleaded with my penis to stay safely ensconced in its sheath, grateful to even have such a thing right now, as I negotiated my way off the counter and onto the lid of the toilet seat. And I didn&#39;t dare to think about what he might mean by that last sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I replied once I had a solid footing on the floor. &quot;It&#39;s a lot to take in. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; E.B. said awkwardly. &quot;About that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;, I shouted, reaching out to grab him by the shoulders as I expected the worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... All day, I&#39;ve been thinking about how to take the transformative magic out of you,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I&#39;m sure I can do it, if the timing is right. Sunday morning would be the perfect time - that one last burst of energy before the full moon goes away. But it would put you back to exactly the same state you were in before I hit you with it. All the healing that came with the changes - gone. You&#39;d suddenly be bleeding from that big gaping head wound of yours again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I cringed at the description. The memory of that night was a blur - was I really hurt <i>that</i> badly? No wonder E.B. had gone to such extreme lengths to heal me. &quot;So...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a way to break the spell without killing you,&quot; he explained. &quot;So I, uh, hope you like this new body of yours, because I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re gonna be seeing it in your wall-pond every full moon from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound so bad,&quot; I blurted out with a sense of relief, then stopped to wonder what the hell I was saying. &quot;I mean, I, um, uh, thought you were gonna say I would be like this all the time or something like that. But if it&#39;s just for a couple days a month...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mind spending more time with me?&quot;, he said with a smirk on his face. My cheeks felt hot, and not just because they were covered in a thick layer of fluff. &quot;Okay, great. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re adjusting to it. I&#39;ll have to show you the ropes of what it means to be a were-bunny, especially at this time of year.&quot; He glanced up at the window, where the last remnants of daylight were fading from the horizon. &quot;And we&#39;ll have to start right now,&quot; he said, suddenly starting to make for the door, then glancing back over his shoulder and beckoning me to go with him. &quot;Come on! If we&#39;re going to find out what the werewolves are up to, they always meet up right when it gets fully dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, right. I remembered the pact I had made with that little paw-shake. I followed him down the stairs and out the window he&#39;d left open. I felt a little silly escaping from my own house this way, but it was still probably easier than getting up on my tiptoes and straining to reach so I could unlock the front door. I pulled myself up right after him, squeezing through the narrow crack and into the darkness.</p>
