<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tom talked was talking with Ashley and Jennifer’s parents Lee and Maggie arrived to see their daughter. While they were upset that Kellie was involved in a fight they were relieved she was uninsured, especially after seeing Mika and Claudia. Tom grumbled as he now hung up his phone. “Damn rude people,” he huffed. “I was able to convince them to come to this address with their daughters however they say our daughters attacked theirs without provocation.”<br />
<br />
The girls noisily began to protest before Tom shot them a stony glance. “Girls,” he said sternly. “We are not having a debate about this but we are squashing this arguement tonight. Is thanunderstood.”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir,” Claudia grumbled.<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she looked at Claudia’s parents. “So what exactly did they say.”<br />
<br />
Tom sighed as he ran a hand through his short hair. “Well they wanted to report it to the police at first. I told them that it would be a waste of time and considering the damage Mika and Claudia a sustained we could just as easily file a complaint of our own. They don’t have a desire to have the police involved so we’ve decided to meet here and work things out.”<br />
<br />
“Guess I’ll make some more coffe then,” Lisa sighed before turning to Maggie. “Any chance you have any deserts at home? I find cake or pie usually helps in the peace process.” Maggie nodded and turned to leave. “Kellie I’m going to need your help with this.”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Kellie whined. “I think I should stay with my friends.” Maggie tuned slightly giving her daughter an icy stare. “Kellie Michelle Carlson you are part of the reason why this happened so unless you want to grounded for the summer I suggest you follow.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed and lowered her head. “Yes mom, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
Katie watched as her girlfriend followed her daughter out of the house. Looking around she could see Aunt Lisa busily trying to clean things up before anyone else arrived. Deciding it would be best to try and get on her moms good side she decided to help. “Need any help,” she offered timidly. Lisa frowned as she looked Katie. “Yes lots,” she grumbled. “Look I’m glad you weren’t directly involved in the fight but my house is turning into Switzerland over here. Why the hell does everyone want to come over here?”<br />
<br />
“Neutral party I guess.”<br />
<br />
“That’s why I said we’re Switzerland.”<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she began brewing another cup of coffee. “By the way I meant to tell you the adoption looks like a go,” she said. “The lawyer said the paperwork should only take a month so congrats.” Katie smiled as she gave her aunt a tight hug. “Thanks mom,” she sighed. Lisa smirked as she looked at her soon to be daughter. “Don’t thank me yet,” she stated. “I’m about to go all mom on you right now. First your grounded for the rest of the week. I don’t care that you weren’t directly involved you ran, you know that’s wrong. Secondly, how much money do you have from babysitting?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, maybe $60 or $70.”<br />
<br />
“Good tomorrow when you get home from school your going shopping for groceries. I like helping your friends but all the meals and clothes is starting to get expensive. If your going to turn our house into a home for wayward girls your pitching in for groceries.”<br />
<br />
Katie opened her mouth but quickly closed it. Honestly it seemed like a fair punishment, Lisa had gone above and beyond in trying to help Katie and her friends. It seemed only fair that she help out Lisa in some way. “Okay that fair,” she sighed. “I’m sorry mom things  have been a little crazy lately I guess.”<br />
<br />
Lisa laughed quietly as she loaded some dishes into the dishwasher. “Yea being a teenager can be rough. I’ll have to tell you some stories one of these days. For now why don’t I you take your friends into the living room for a bit so the adults can talk.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded, motioning to her friends Katie led them into the living room to watch t.v. As the girls were beginning to settle in Kellie returned with Maggie. Kellie quietly now made her way into the living room while Maggie went to join the adults in the kitchen. “Wow my mom is pissed.” Kellie said. “She wants to know how I could get involved in a fight at the mall. I told her I wasn’t even involved but she still grounded me for the rest of week.”<br />
<br />
“Join the club,” Katie grumbled. Mary Elise and Samantha looked at the girls and sighed. “I’m pretty sure we’re all getting grounded for this one,” she sighed. “So much for date night.”<br />
<br />
Claudia looked over at Mika who still had an icepack on her eye. “How you doing Mika,” she asked. Mika smiled as she looked at her girlfriend with her one good eye. “It only hurts if I move,” she smiled. “I’ll be okay. By the way guys I really want to thank all of you. I never realized just how lucky I was to have you all as friends.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled and gently kissed Mika on the cheek. “Stop Mika,” she said sweetly. “I think I’m out of tears and I don’t want to start blubbering in front of the Major.” Mika grinned as she gazed at Claudia. “I seriously can’t believe you guys were actually going to let me crash at your houses,” she said. “If it didn’t hurt so much I’d hug all of you.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t thank me yet, you have no idea what it’s like living with the major. Hope you like early mornings and chores.”<br />
<br />
Mika’s good eye bulged before a smile spread across her lips. “If I’m with you I think I can handle anything.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled before turning to Katie and Kellie. “Can I talk to you two real quick, in private.”<br />
<br />
The three girls now stood and walked to an adjoining room away from everyone else.<br />
<br />
“So,” she asked. “Who changed my dad?”<br />
<br />
Katie raised her hand sheepishly as Kellie stepped forward. “Katie did it but I’m the one that suggested it,” she said sheepishly. “Please don’t be mad at her it’s my fault.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled before throwing herself on Kellie and giving her a bear hug. “Thank you Kellie,” she sighed. “That was one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me. You have no idea how much it means to have my dad accept this. By the way how did you do it.”<br />
<br />
“I asked Katie to change is mindset. Give him a younger more modern view of the world.”<br />
<br />
Claudia nodded as she rubbed her chin. “Damn,” she exclaimed. “Didn’t know you could do that.”<br />
<br />
“Neither did we,” Katie said.<br />
<br />
The sound of someone at the front door caused the girls to turn and head back towards the living room. No what standing in the doorway were Ashley, Jennifer and their parents. Claudia smiled as she gazed at the two teenage girls. Ashley said eye was swollen in what was obviously a black eye. Jennifer on the other hand now sported a crooked nose thanks to Mika. Before anyone could say anything the girls parents spoke. “I’m looking for Tom Harris,” Ashley’s father said tersely.<br />
<br />
Tom Harris loomed into the foyer looking down at Ashley’s father. “That would be me,” he said coldly giving the man the same stare he had initially given Claudia. Ashley’s father gulped as he looked up at this monster of a man. “My name is Phillip Moore,” he gulped. “I believe we have some business to discuss.” Tom continued to stare down at the smaller man. “Right this way,” he gestured not breaking eye contact. Phillip gulped as he tried to compose himself. “Yes, right come along Ashley,” he stammered. “You too Jennifer.”<br />
<br />
Ashley and Jennifer stared daggers at the group as they entered the kitchen. The group slowly made there way in as well and now stood by their parents. The girls now glared at each other with venomous looks as their parents spoke.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Harris,” Phillip stated. “I believe your daughter owes our daughter and her friend an apology.”<br />
<br />
“It’s Major Harris to you sir,” Tom said tersely. “And my understanding of the events is that it was your daughters that started this mess in the first place.”<br />
<br />
Phillip grimaced as he ran his hands through his dark hair. “With all due respect sir,” he said coldly. “Have you looked at my daughters face.”<br />
<br />
“What about my daughter,” Jennifer’s father yelled. “That little tramp of a girl broke her nose. I should sue her family for damages.”<br />
<br />
Tom turned his head slowly as he now flared at the other man. Jennifer’s father, like Ashley’s, was a smaller man with a skinny build and dark hair. Both men looked like the types that would never do any work for themselves but pass the buck on to their subordinates. They were too busy counting their money and it was something Tom absolutely detested. “I’m afraid I didn’t catch your name,” he said icily.<br />
<br />
“Alexander Bishop,” he stated smugly. “I’ll have you know Major that I am considering pressing charges on both your daughter and her friend Mika.”<br />
<br />
Tom furrowed his brow as he glared at Alexander. “You could do that sir,” he said. “However if you do I will be filing charges as well. In case you haven’t noticed all four of them sustained injuries.”<br />
<br />
Alexander glared up at Tom, he had hoped that by involving the law it would intimidate Tom. Unfortunately for him Tom was not a man easily intimidated. Tom now surveyed the group in front of him with a critical eye.<br />
<br />
 “Now we all know what this is about,” he stated. “These girls had a fight that started when someone informed not only myself but Mika’s parents of the girls relationship.” Alexander and Phillip looked to say something but Tom shot them an intimidating glance. “I’m not finished,” he growled. “As a result of those actions Mika has been kicked out of her home. For now the girl will be staying with my wife and myself. The reason we are here is to end this pettiness befor it gets more out of hand.”<br />
<br />
Tom motioned for Claudia and Mika to step forward. “Girls,” he said firmly. “This ends tonight. You two are to apologize to those two girls and then stay away from them.” Mika and Claudia frowned as Ashley and Jennifer sneered at them. Tom now turned his gaze on Ashley and Jennifer. “I wouldn’t be so smug their dear,” he growled. Ashley and Jennifer went pale under Toms menacing stare. “You two will be dong the same. I am not interested in who started what but your actions have put a girl out on the street. This pettiness ends tonight and you are to leave these girls alone.”<br />
<br />
“You can not possibly think this will work,” Alexander scoffed. Tom glared at him before slowly approaching him. “This will work Mr. Bishop,” he growled. “Or I will be visiting you personally.” Alexander went pale as he stared up at Tom. Nodding in agreement he looked down at his daughter. “Jennifer you heard the man,” he stammered. “You are to apologize to these girls and leave them be.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Jennifer muttered.<br />
<br />
“Louder please,” Alexander orders.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed and rolled her eyes. “Fine I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Yea I’m sorry too,” Ashley said quietly.<br />
<br />
Pleased that he had accomplished what he set out to do Tom now glared down at Alexander. “I thank you for your time Mr. Bishop,” he said. “Our business is concluded you may leave but their is just one more thing.”<br />
<br />
Alexander gave Tom a confused look as the man stared daggers at him. “Yes,” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Please do not refer to my daughters friend as a tramp,” he said. “I take comments like that....PERSONALLY!”<br />
<br />
Alexander looked at the giant that was Tom Harris as he broke into a cold sweat. “Yes Of course,” he muttered. “My apologies Mika I was, acting irrational. Come along girls were leaving.”<br />
<br />
Ashley, Jennifer and their parents now quickly turned and left Lisa without a word as Tom continued to stare them down. As they left he turned slowly towards his family and friends and gave them a small smile. “I think that went well,” he smirked. “Now how about some pie.”<br />
<br />
The girls, still in shock, turned to Claudia in wonder. “Claudia,” Katie and Kellie murmured. “Your dad is  a Fucking BADASS!”</p>
