<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The entire drive to the school the only thing John could think about was his dick. The average member was now larger than he&#39;d ever even imagined and was currently distracting him. It&#39;d gotten hard again, forcing his legs to separate further than he was used to while he drove to school. Not too mention how much blood had to pump through it to keep himself up. He tried redirecting the blood flow but the thought of pushing his dick all the way into his wife shot through his head again. His body squirmed in the car seat as he thought about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down. Calm down,&quot; he told himself as he pulled into the parking space. However it just didn&#39;t seem to listen. Despite the large bulge traveling down his right leg, John still had to go into the school. He didn&#39;t know what was going to happen though. Even in the car he could see it clearly in his pants. &quot;What if...&quot; his attention turned to the computer that he&#39;d used last night. &quot;If it was able to change the size would it be able to do other things as well?&quot; <br />
<br />
He stared at the blank screen with the flashing bar. &quot;Fuck it,&quot; he told himself as he started typing. &#39;No one notices that I&#39;m hard unless I want them to notice.&#39; His finger dangled over the enter button and then he finally pressed it. A wave of relief came over his body. &quot;Did it work?&quot; he looked down at the bulge nearly going down to his knee. It didn&#39;t bother him at all. He wondered if that was okay but shrugged it off. Right now he had to start heading towards the gym. He was still there before all the students and had to &#39;get his day prepared.&#39;<br />
<br />
Normally that just had him sitting in his office looking at online videos but today was different. He had something else on his mind. At 31 he was still in pretty good shape, but he could see traces of a belly starting to stick out in front of him. Not to mention the flab that was building around his chest and arms. Even his tight ass started to lose it&#39;s structure. He just didn&#39;t have the time or energy to workout the way he did in college. Bags were forming under his eyes and he could see small wrinkles around his face. However with this little baby maybe he could change all that. <br />
<br />
He stood in the middle of the weight room looking over his frame. He&#39;d never given it too much thought. But that bulge sticking out in front of him just reminded him what else he could change. It was a spark that reignited his imagination to what he could be. &quot;I could be a bodybuilder...&quot; a grin crossed his face as he thought about their huge bloated muscles. When he was in college he&#39;d always make fun of them for trying to hard. However there was always a faint bit of jealously that he refused to admit that he felt towards those guys. Their large imposing muscles always made them  a sight to see. Just by entering a room they were able to draw everyone&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
John instantly started typing. &#39;I have a genetic disposition to grow muscle and lose fat. Even without hormone enhancers I naturally create as many hormones as guys normally on them. I have been working out like a bodybuilder since high school.&#39; He stared down at the couple of sentences he&#39;d just typed wondering just how big he&#39;d get. Again a grin crossed his face. He hit enter.<br />
<br />
Instantly he could already feel the changes in his body. He could see the muscle building underneath his school polo and jeans. Blood pulsed through his veins at an alarming rate. Each vein bulged out of his skin. He could see the pulsing. The fat almost disappeared from his body. Then came the growth. Muscle built upon muscle. Each one growing thicker than he had ever imagined. Big round biceps surrounded by horse shaped triceps and forearms that were thicker than most peoples legs made up his arms. Large cannonball shaped shoulders gave him an extra wide frame while he barely even had a 32 inch waist. He had to always go a few sizes up on pants as anything that could fit a 32 inch waist wasn&#39;t nearly wide enough to fit his massive quads or even his thick calves. <br />
<br />
His pecs pushed out at his polo making it near impossible to button up to the top button. Even the second one was straining across the muscular chest. He stared at his body and then lifted up the bottom of his shirt, running his hands over the solid six pack that he&#39;d only be able to see in the mirror. Looking down was hard as his pecs pushed far too forward to get a good look at anything other than the solid muscle. He ran his massive hand over the other muscles feeling the definition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; he grunted, trying to maintain his composure. His dick grew hard again thinking about the sudden growth. He was absolutely massive. Even walking had become difficult as it had turned more into a waddle. His legs were far too thick to walk normally, as the muscle rubbed up against each other. He looked at his body seeing just how hard it was to move and figured it was because he was still only 5&#39;9&quot;. Looking over himself, he somehow knew he weighed close to 300 pounds of near solid muscle. With only a 7% body fat ratio he never looked like he was off season.<br />
<br />
However not being able to move so well he figured that would become a bit of a hindrance. He walked back over to the computer and started typing again, &#39;I&#39;m 6&#39;8&quot;&#39; and hit enter. Instantly he could feel his body stretching towards the ceiling. Every bone in his body grew longer but also thicker. They were designed to carry his new weight. He stretched his muscles out feeling them grow longer but maintain the same amount of strength. But with his new height he might have been even stronger. He looked at the mirror inspecting his body again. <br />
<br />
A sense of pride overcame him as he thought about his new body. He now stood a good head over everyone in the school and was twice as thick. Some doors were even difficult to get through. He could remember having to pick up his wife several times whenever they kissed and loved how she barely even came up to his chest. &quot;This is crazy,&quot; he was still running his hands over his body. Even his dick had gotten hard again but the 13 inches looked like they fit his body far better than when he was only 5&#39;9&quot;. Trying to ignore it, he headed back to his office. <br />
<br />
The small cube with a desk that filled nearly half the room was harder to navigate now. &quot;That&#39;s fixable,&quot; he said looking down at his computer again. However there was a knock on the door.</p>
