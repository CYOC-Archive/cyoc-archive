<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Susan Gilt Spa was a massive and expensive place to go for relaxation. Full body massages, seaweed wraps, and an elaborate series of jet pools that ranged from blisteringly hot to frigidly cold. Gwen arrived outside it in her beat up car and entered the building being greeted by all the staff before she put on a uniform and took her position along the line.<br />
<br />
Of course she couldn’t afford a place like this even on a wage provided by it. Instead her job was to apply “Non GMO, all natural, locally grown, pesticide free, raises in 100% clay seaweed” to her customers. It was ground up into a powder that she mixed with water before the rejuvenating green mixture was applied to every part of the subject’s skin. Breasts, ass, and skin around the genitals, it was all touched by her delicate fingers and not everyone who used the spa was a model.<br />
<br />
However today the powder that came in was blue. At first Gwen thought it had gone bad but upon talking to her manager it was revealed the seaweed was blue, peddled as even more natural than normal. Honestly she didn’t even care and just told Gwen to announce it was some rare kind grown in spring pools that softened the pores more than normal. Gwen didn’t have time to argue seeing as people were beginning to arrive. Socialites and models who were above shaving their own legs and treating the employees with an iota of respect. Gwen could already hear the harassment they just had to put up with.<br />
<br />
“CAREFUL YOU CHINK!” Some shrill and obnoxious voice screamed from the next room over, definitely bound for Tegan, a girl who was about as American as they come but because her family had the appearance of Chinese...<br />
<br />
Gwen had to listen to this woman comment on every little thing they did and sweat began to bead on her head partiall thanks to the hot cleansing pools used to wash off all the seaweed wrap she was about to apply but also from nerves. Then before she could think much further the woman entered her station. She was beautiful but all that beauty was tarnished by a massive frown and glare. She stormed in and Gwen literally had to curtsy for her before requesting she sit down. The woman removed her robe and Gwen got an eyeful of her rather large tits and wondered why it was always the assholes who got well endowed.<br />
<br />
“I have rare blue Spanish Seaweed for you today,” Gwen announced while resisting the urge to add, “From concentrate!” Just so she could go find a normal bin of the stuff when the woman freaked out but she didn’t even awknowedge Gwen. She just lay down and Gwen sighed before grabbing a brush and proceeding to basically paint the woman with blue seaweed mud. She painted her breasts first and the woman frowned the entire time. She did all of her body before finally drawing on her face while being shouted at to avoid the hair. The lady then had cucumbers put over her eyes and a pair of headphones that belonged to the shop placed in her ears. She continued to frown even then and Gwen just glared at her now that she couldn’t see her. She sat there for some time with her skin being rejuvenated by the seaweed mud and Gwen got to work on a twenty year old who wanted to be talkative. She was a television actress who had just finished a few months of solid shooting for a sitcom aimed at kids. She seemed friendly enough and Gwen had a nice time listening to her. She eventually had to stop though as Gwen applied seaweed mud around her face, all caught in an exuberant smile. Cucumbers went over her eyes and she got to listen to music too. However Gwen heard her humming from across the room and it put a smile on her own face. She called the older lady over after a few minutes and began to peel off the seaweed wrap. Much to her shock however the woman’s skin wasn’t rejuvenated, it was wrinkles. She peeled off more and more finding breasts had sagged, skin had tanned with time, and height had dropped. She wasn’t even a nice elderly. She looked bitchy with a permafrown and ugly piles of flesh accompanied by bulges of fat. Her hair turned white before Gwen’s eyes and she began to complain like an old woman. All her heath problems and surgeries. She then hobbled off to the next area and Gwen turned towards that friendly actress in fear. Minutes passed and anticipation was killing her. Eventually however a timer rang and Gwen got her up the second it did and with a cringe peeled back some of the seaweed mud. It broke to the floor and she was left staring in shock at the twenty year old. Her mouth was agape and even she was getting turned on. The girl looked beautiful, no angelic. Her skin was perfect, her curves were flawless, and her hair had taken on a new lush look. That smile was brighter than ever and Gwen hardly noticed the happiness she exerted. Gwen just felt happy looking at her, she felt happy being in her presence. It was like this woman was a ray of sunshine after a storm. She made Gwen feel joy, all negative emotions washed away.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for everything,” The woman grinned before heading off to spread her beauty to the next station. Gwen just watched her go, certain she had just become bisexual.</p>
