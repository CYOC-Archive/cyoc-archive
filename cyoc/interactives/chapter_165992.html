<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I ran back to the barracks, my mind racing with the image of Doug and Alex now in captivity. As I drew nearer to the room, a familiar stench filled my nostrils. Once I ran through the open doorway, I realised its source, as I felt my cock squirm in my shorts. I jerked off just a few minutes ago, however seeing the barracks caused my balls to quickly fill.<br />
<br />
I could tell Andy didn’t just smell the fumes of the liquid. He was a lot bigger than before. As his enlarged limbs dangled over the edge of his bed, I saw his thick, meaty pecs rise and fall, his breaths heavy and slow. Whatever remained of his striped pyjamas clung helplessly to his frame, with the buttons of his shirt ready to pop. The only part of him that moved somewhat energetically was his cock, as it throbbed, with a thick trail of his seed falling down the shaft like a waterfall. He looked more like a soldier now. His once smooth face was now covered in stubble, his jaw sharp and wide. I wasn’t sure if he was even conscious, as a drop of sweat trickled down his face. His musk was so potent, it was clashing with the smell of his cum, which was all over the beds, and the floor.<br />
<br />
“Jesus, are you okay?”<br />
<br />
He mumbled something, but I couldn’t make it out. It was like he didn’t even have the energy to speak. His cock throbbed again as I continued.<br />
<br />
“We found him, Doug, in the yard. He was huge. Alex tried to talk to him, but now…they were both captured and taken into the lab-“<br />
<br />
Suddenly, like a flash, Andy rose from his bed. The mere thought of Doug in captivity must have triggered this sudden boost of energy. He looked at me with a fearful, yet determined expression.<br />
<br />
“We have to get them out of there. Oh…my voice. It’s…woah…”<br />
<br />
Andy’s voice was a lot deeper now. He looked down, and gently placed his palms on his chest. I don’t think he took the time to fully realise his new form. As he flexed his huge biceps in amazement, I tried to reason with him.<br />
<br />
“Listen, we can’t just stroll in there. They’ve probably got guards on every door.”<br />
“I can’t believe it actually worked. I look great!”<br />
<br />
He let out a low grunt as he tore his pyjama shirt off, the buttons flying everywhere. He then jumped to his feet, almost falling over due to his increased height. When he regained his balanced, he went over to Doug’s trunk, and began rummaging with his large hands.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?”<br />
“I’m guessing none of my clothes will fit me anymore.”<br />
“How are you feeling?”<br />
“Honestly? I feel amazing! Like I could run a marathon!”<br />
“Wait, earlier you said you found something in Reed’s office. What did you find?”<br />
“Here.”<br />
<br />
Andy picked up a small box from the floor and threw it to me. The box was cardboard, and completely white, with the number 10 written on its lid. Once I looked inside, my eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“This is…this is impossible!”<br />
“That’s why I took it. Something tells me we shouldn’t trust our Lieutenant.”<br />
“You think he knows what they’re doing in the lab?”<br />
“Of course he knows! I bet you he’s in charge of it all.”<br />
<br />
I reached into the box and pulled out a small vial of purple liquid. It looked exactly identical to the one I found yesterday. So much has happened since then. My head began to hurt, as I sat on the only chair that was standing upright. The sudden realisation of Reed’s involvement hit me like a brick wall. Andy was trying to fit his bulbous asscheeks into a pair of Doug’s boxers.<br />
<br />
“Why would he have this?”<br />
“Isn’t it obvious? He clearly takes some of it.”<br />
“You’re probably right.”<br />
“My guess is he regulates his dose, otherwise he’d end up like that researcher earlier.”<br />
“Or like Doug.”<br />
“Exactly.”<br />
“But how do they make it? And, why?”<br />
“Well, there’s only one way to find out. Ready?”<br />
<br />
He held out his hand, and lifted me to my feet. I must admit, it felt weird to be looking up at him for a change. Although I couldn’t help but allow my eyes to wander down his muscular form. The almost skintight vest that clung to his torso perfectly showed off his six pack, which bulged through the fabric. By then I realised a large tent had formed in my shorts, pointing directly at the soldier before me. Andy’s cock was still throbbing in his cargo trousers, which could barely wrap around his wide thighs. He looked so different. As we stared at each other for a few moments I knew he had the same thought as I did. Part of me just wanted him then and there, but I knew we needed to free the rest of our squad. I noticed his other hand was clutching a large, metal flask.<br />
<br />
“What’s that for?”<br />
“I told you, I’ve got an idea.”<br />
<br />
With a sly wink, he lead us out of the barracks. Even thought I didn’t know him long, I knew something was different about him. Gone was the shy, often quiet boy who arm-wrestler Doug. In his place stood a tall, powerful beast of a man, and he was starting to act like one too. The blinding rays of the sun interrupted my daydreaming, as I found myself crouched behind a Jeep, with Andy beside me, wiping sweat off his brow. <br />
<br />
The entrance to the lab was just a few metres ahead of us, however it was guarded by two men dressed all in black, with gas masks and gloves. Their uniforms looked incredibly thick, and acted like furnaces under the harsh sunlight. The taller one was pacing restlessly in circles, whilst the smaller one watched on, adjusting the crotch area of his uniform as he leant against the wall of the lab.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, I don’t know what’s gonna kill me. The heat of these uniform.”<br />
“This is bullshit!”<br />
“Remember when it was raining yesterday? I miss the rain.”<br />
“Why are we even out here?! There aren’t any intruders. All the weird shit going on is happening in there.”<br />
“I told you, we’re here in case someone tries to escape.”<br />
“You’ve see how big they can get. They’d tear us in half!”<br />
“Dude, stop pacing. I’m sweating buckets over here, and watching you move around is tiring me out!”<br />
“Fine!”<br />
<br />
Before I could even ask what Andy’s plan was, he noticed he had held out his hand, smiling.<br />
“Pass me the vial.”<br />
<br />
Of course! I handed him the liquid, of which he carefully poured into the flask, avoiding the fumes that escaped. As he shook the flask to mix it all together, we briefly looked at each other. With a confidant grin, Andy stepped out into the open and slowly made his way towards the two guards. Upon seeing him, the two soldiers hastily put one hand on the barrel of their tasers.<br />
<br />
“Halt! You can’t go in.”<br />
“I know. I just thought you boys might want a drink.”<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“Lemonade.”<br />
“Oh, alright then.”<br />
<br />
The smaller one casually removed his gas mask and took the flask from Andy, taking one long sip. The larger one didn’t move, as if something had caught his eyes. Andy smiled at him.<br />
<br />
“What about you, big guy?”<br />
“Oh umm, sure, thanks.”<br />
<br />
He removed his mask, revealing an incredibly handsome, and doe-eyed face. He continued staring at Andy as his partner handed him the flask. Then, he tilted his head back and finished the drink, wiping his mouth with his gloves. When he handed the flask back to Andy, their hands touched. He laughed.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name?”<br />
“Private Smith.”<br />
“No, your real name.”<br />
“Oh, Sean. This is Ben.”<br />
“Well, Sean, I hope to see more of you around here.”<br />
“I’d like that.”<br />
<br />
He slowly turned and walked back to the Jeep, noticing the larger guard was watching him go. Once he sneakily ducked behind the car, he almost burst out laughing. I stared at him in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“That was amazing! I can’t believe that actually worked.”<br />
“Now, we wait.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the smaller soldier noticed his partner daydreaming, and laughed.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never seen a guy have that much of an effect on you.”<br />
“Yeah…”<br />
“I dunno what was in that drink, but I feel a lot better now. The uniform is still too tight though.”<br />
“Yeah…”<br />
<br />
Sean adjusted his crotch, unaware that his cock was growing. Ben was too busy trying to put his mask on to notice his ass expand, pushing against the fabric of his uniform. The changes had already started. As they were about to go back to leaning against the walls of the lab, Sean noticed something strange about his partner.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?”<br />
“What? What’s going on?”<br />
“Stand in front of me.”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“Just do it.”<br />
<br />
Ben reluctantly moved closer to him. Sean’s suspicions were confirmed, as Ben’s eyes widened. They were now the same height. Ben had somehow grown a few inches. They both began to panic.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you’ve grown!”<br />
“How? I’ve had my gas mask on all day! Ohhh…”<br />
<br />
He turned around and watched his ass grow again, his perfectly round rump stretching his uniform. His sensitive cheeks sent jolts of pleasure throughout his body. Sean couldn’t help but rub his crotch, feeling his hormones run wild in his veins. He then suddenly realised that his cock was now fully erect, and at least a foot long. His balls swelled in size. He was growing hornier by the second.<br />
<br />
“Shit! I’m growing too! It was that guy! He must’ve spiked that drink!”<br />
“Oh God, I feel so hot…”<br />
“FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Almost simultaneously, they watched helplessly as their muscles expanded, their hulking frames growing out of their uniforms. Sean’s shoulders widened considerably. Even from a distance, I could see the outline of his mountainous pecs through the black fabric. Because their uniforms were so thick, they clung to their growing bodies, unwilling to tear or give in. As Ben grew in height, he frantically tried to unzip out of his clothes. He could feel an endless stream of testosterone flood his body, as a thick layer of stubble sprouted on his jawline. He moaned aloud with his now-deeper voice when the ridiculously tight uniform began rubbing against his cock. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Fuck! The zipper’s broken! Everything’s so tight-“<br />
“ARGHHHH!”<br />
<br />
Sean firmly gripped the collar of his uniform and, with all of his newfound strength, tore it completely in half, revealing his incredibly muscular form, which was pouring with sweat. Once he broke free from his fabric cage, he gazed upon his new, hairy body in awe. His monstrous cock sprang out as it grew another few inches. Ben watched his partner’s balls almost double in size. Without any hesitation, as if his primal urges kicked in, Sean reached for him, and was able to tear off Ben’s uniform with ease, as if he was tearing paper. The two soldiers stood completely naked at a height of roughly 8ft, almost as tall as Doug. Puddles of their sweat began to form on the ground beneath them. I was about to make a run for it to the lab, however Andy grabbed my shoulder, squeezing it gently.<br />
<br />
“Not yet. Wait for it….”<br />
<br />
Even through his cargo trousers, I knew his cock had never been harder. Mine was ready to burst from my shorts as we continued watching the guards.<br />
<br />
They stared at each other, taking in their partner’s new, god-like physiques. It looked like they had just run a marathon. Having been trapped in thick black fabric, combined with the sweltering heat from the sun, their bodies were soaking wet with their juices. Their abnormally high body heat only exacerbated things. They both knew what they wanted. Without a single word uttered, It wasn’t long before the two began making out, tossing their sweaty bodies on the floor. They rolled around in the puddles, their large hands exploring every part of their partner. Once Ben had buried his face into Sean’s thick armpit hair, Andy let go of me.<br />
<br />
“OK, now!”<br />
<br />
We both ran for it, keeping distance from the two giants before us. Our boners swung around as we ran. The two guards didn’t even notice us. All they cared about was fucking each other. We dashed into the entrance, hearing the two roar with pleasure from behind us. I slammed the doors shut. I couldn’t believe it. We were actually inside the lab. Although, I don’t think I was really prepared for what I was about to see.</p>
