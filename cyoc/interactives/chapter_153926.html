<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad sat there quietly as he listened to Connor give his explanation on how things had gone in relation to his sexuality and all that. In a &quot;normal conversation,&quot; this wouldn&#39;t necessarily be his business, but Connor had always been a friend and he could never understand what Amy had told him that Connor at times the previous day had seemed more interested in some of the other males at Moon Lake High rather than the females. After all, he and Connor had hung out a lot in the past and Conner had often talked with him about girls and that sort of thing. Connor had even talked getting interested in a TV show that had a female werewolf as one of the show&#39;s main characters <br />
<br />
Thus Amy&#39;s report to him had thrown him for a loop. That had partially set up the reasoning for talking with Ryan about it and then setting up the present meeting. Tad had even been further surprised when apparently Ryan and Conner had apparently talked about some things and Connor had seemed to give some occasional comments that seemed to lean more toward being interested in men but when asked would give rather &quot;guarded&quot; answers and Ryan chose not to press on the matter. That only made Tad wonder more and he&#39;d figured that it was best to push on that subject and get Connor to give a clear answer.<br />
<br />
A lot of this related to the fact that Tad knew that normals becoming weres didn&#39;t get a chance at second chances. His parents had made it pretty clear after he turned fourteen that if ever turned a normal girl, that girl would become a were and could never be a normal human again. This also included the warning that if that were to happen, Tad would have to be VERY confident that the girl wouldn&#39;t betray the existence of weres to anyone and that she knew about what would happen before they took that step. Though, Tad never hit it off well enough with anyone to go that far until he&#39;d met Amy, and she was already a werewolf. A part of it was also with what he understood with regard to werecats and their male equivalent, werewildcats, in that sexuality changes were a clear possibility with these mono-gendered weres to begin with.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that Tad had anything wrong with that, as he knew his mom was bisexual and that Claire had at least become bisexual, if she wasn&#39;t already when his mom turned her. There was nothing that Tad saw that was really wrong with that, but if Connor was struggling with something or was unsure of his sexuality, he didn&#39;t want his friend to jump into anything that would set things in stone with no way to get out of it once done. So far, some of Connor&#39;s answers heled and let Tad relax a little, though it still seemed like there were some things that were unknown... at least to Tad.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Connor... from what you&#39;ve said... it&#39;d seem like you&#39;re bi...&quot; Tad said slowly, &quot;having at least some interest in both men and women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... it&#39;s... I don&#39;t know conflicted,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;I&#39;ve seen some women and I do find them attractive... then I&#39;ve seen some men and find them more attractive... and then I see some other man and find him totally ugly... It&#39;s confusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could just be your own tastes, though,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;I know I&#39;m gay... and there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. But that doesn&#39;t mean I find every man handsome. Some are... but there will be some that just aren&#39;t. It&#39;s partially why my mom has said that you should never marry someone solely because of their looks. You never know what&#39;s on the inside. It&#39;s probably a result of her relations that lead to my older... half brother... or at least part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Connor said looking down at his feet, ignoring the concerned look Tad gave him while Ryan looked to him from his bed, &quot;that makes sense... I suppose... though... I&#39;d wonder why... why I&#39;ve wondered on things? Why you guys were so concerned? Why...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re my friend,&quot; Tad cut him off and leaned forward to place a hand on Connor&#39;s shoulder which lead to Connor visibly relaxing, &quot;and friends help each other, no matter what. There is nothing wrong with you being bi. My mom is bi and presently is involved with a woman she turned into a werecat. And from some things that were told to be by those who noticed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for me with some of your answers from yesterday...&quot; Ryan added.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Something seemed wrong,&quot; Tad finished, &quot;and I wasn&#39;t about to let a good friend be hurt or make a mistake trying to figure things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor gave a weak smile at that. He wasn&#39;t quite sure who Tad mentioned by &quot;those who noticed,&quot; but then he might have meant Amy or one of the other weres he&#39;d met at Moon Lake High. He didn&#39;t have too much in the way of trouble, but he did notice that there were plenty of people on edge regarding the reveal and he decided not to get too deep into that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m glad old friends and new friends are willing and able to help,&quot; Connor spoke after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be something that&#39;s for the best,&quot; Ryan said slowly, &quot;especially if you&#39;d want to be a werewildcat... as if you are perfectly straight now... you wouldn&#39;t be after the transformation. The only way your sexuality wouldn&#39;t change is if you knew you were already bi or gay as you&#39;d already meet the werecat/werewildcat sexuality requirements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that is something I&#39;ve been trying to figure out... if slowly,&quot; Connor commented, &quot;and not really getting answers as to why there are times where it seems to flip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad looked to Ryan for a moment, &quot;Have you ever had any issues with your dad or mom? I mean... they&#39;ve always seemed to be pretty good so far as I could tell... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded as Tad&#39;s voice fell off at the end, &quot;My parents have always been good and understanding. Shoot... it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if my parents decide to join a were group at some point... so, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m at risk of being ostracized for being gay or bi or whatever. That&#39;s never been a fear. More that I&#39;ve just never known the answer... never really know how to determine the answer and got conflicting sensations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad was a bit curious on that, as he&#39;d never noticed that before, but maybe he&#39;d never really payed attention and just made assumptions about his best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the reason to become a werewildcat if you don&#39;t know?&quot; Tad wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... mostly because they are smaller,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;that they aren&#39;t so big that they&#39;d shred their clothes transforming... and I&#39;ve never really been into rabbits, rats or things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are other smaller weres to consider,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;at least while you&#39;re still figuring things out... werefoxes, wereraccoons, wereskunks, weredogs, and wereotters will all be small enough in their fursonas that you wouldn&#39;t lose your clothing transforming. That might be something to consider... at least while you&#39;re still figuring other things out. And since they wouldn&#39;t affect your sexuality... if you do figure out that you&#39;re bi or gay... what fursona you&#39;d have wouldn&#39;t change that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;d accept someone that might be... different?&quot; Connor asked feeling a bit more relaxed. He wasn&#39;t fully sure on things yet, but as he relaxed in one of the beanbags that Ryan had set out, he actually felt a bit better on the whole matter being in the open and that no one had rejected him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ryan nodded, &quot;Some may not have homosexual or bi members... sometimes because I think those who are already gay or bisexual get funneled into the werecats or werewildcats, depending on the gender... but if one is truly determined, just about every were group would ultimately accept things. Part of it is because of how open Moon Lake has been generally with regard to sexuality. And while you&#39;re researching things... you&#39;d have the time to learn more and figure things out so that you know for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Connor managed, &quot;thank you.&quot;</p>
