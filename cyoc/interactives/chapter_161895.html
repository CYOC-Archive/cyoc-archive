<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dusk became darkness, as shadows deepen and dark colored furry bodied individual became cloaked, and able to run. So Kyle ran, he discarded his bike, felt more a need to do something more physically exertive as to run; dashing across lawns, open spaces, stopping only to hide from people being close.<br />
<br />
Kyle was young and in good physical shape, he rode in bicycle races, he had good stamina. Yet as he had begun his changes, his stamina increased, and continued to enhance as he changed of species. He had stopped to wait for a family getting out of their van, as they went to enter their house, Kyle waited until his path was cleared. It was again a time to think as he thought about how he felt, as felt stronger, elated with the thought he might soon become as all a Goat.<br />
<br />
He was not panting as out of breath, and considering the distance he had run, the increased speed he ran, had Kyle to look down to see that as his legs had changed. His legs had grown stronger, but it was his feet from exertion of running had reconfigured. “I have hocks, as hind feet, my toes have changed, I got cloven hoofs!”<br />
<br />
Something inside of Kyle suggested of his physical changes as being bad, not good, and detrimental. As at the same time something else within him made Kyle feel elated, adventurous, lusty, and wanting to know what it could be like when being a buck goat.<br />
<br />
“Ah-huh, the battle inside me is Good fighting with Evil, but it seems to me I want of the evil to win!” Kyle thought to himself as he stood crouched and waiting. Yet the parents entered the house and the three children began a game of tag; forcing Kyle to remain where he was, crouched low and staying concealed.<br />
<br />
As time moved onward and the sky darkened to night a worried mother called to her children to come into the house.<br />
<br />
“At last,” grumbled Kyle as he tried to rise and stand then fully upright. <br />
<br />
“Wh-o-a…,” Kyle groaned as with trying to upright himself, he discovered his changing legs and goat feet had fully conformed to walking with a crouched hind legged stance. As he discovered a new part of his adventure, Kyle stood on all fours, supported my arms and hands plus then the hind quarters, and hind legs, feet, as hooves of him <br />
becoming more a Goat.<br />
<br />
Fleeted running turned into a strange sense of scampering, certainly not near as fast a style of travel, but still felt as the beginning of feeling such a stance was as proper.<br />
<br />
Kyle continued his travel, heading according to his original plan of entering the Killingsworth farm, joining their goat herd and mix into them with him being a buck wanting to fuck. However, the four legged style of scampering increased his exertion. He began to dash from hiding place to the next place to hide as take a needed rest. As Kyle made a fast dash across a street, he felt his butt force out several turds. What seemed odd after he had crossed the road and pooped, something behind him did tickle his most sensitive skin!<br />
<br />
“Hey, I am becoming more like a goat, I now have a tail!” Kyle exclaimed at least thinking it mentally. As Kyle tried again to exclaim his delight for becoming more a Goat, what heard was the bland tone cry of a bleating goat nearby.<br />
<br />
Thinking it neat that some real goat was nearby, Kyle a third time tried to give a greeting. As this time the road behind him was devoid of cars and noises, so he heard the bleat, as felt it in his own throat, it was him bleating. <br />
<br />
“Bleat, bleat,” the dull tone sound of “Naa…, naa…,” alerted Kyle that as he ran, he was changing, as his head had begun to reconfigure. A long black colored tongue protruded from out his new muzzle to lick at his then runny nostrils.  <br />
<br />
Kyle felt the urge to shake his head and found he rotated his elongate goat head, making then his long floppy goat ears to swat across his wide set apart eyes. Seeing was the next item he took to noting, as Kyle saw with then rectangular reshaped pupils. His sense of adventure had changed as well, Kyle felt aggravated about the drastic differences between a human and becoming a goat.<br />
<br />
Why then but he felt the urge of a full bladder and standing on all fours, he relaxed and let his urine to flow.<br />
<br />
“That felt different, as if a statement of his being free from human social morals, he becoming a animal, soon as all a goat, to feel a need was to let things happen, as who cared!”</p>
