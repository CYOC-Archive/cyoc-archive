<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mickey John is astonished to see everything from his new size.  Roaming his new environment, he figures out he is between 25 and 30 cm tall. For many, just the idea of being that tiny would be a nightmare, but not for him though. So he walks away from the fountain to go to a park that is not so far away from his position. To be save, he goes along the curbs to avoid being hit by any pedestrian shoes.<br />
<br />
Entering the park, he prefers to hide behind some bushes in several areas he explores. He sees a few giant men running on a path, luckily for the tiny guy, they just passed their way. But switching to another bush, he sees two teenage boys he recognizes. They are lying side by side on a large blanket, taking a sunbath. They are not kids anymore, but still just old enough teens to know about sexuality and old enough to practice it.  One of them is Matt, he is the paperboy who delivered his newspaper for a few years and still does. He also does various tasks in the neighbourhood for extra cash. To be objective, we have to say he has a very handsome face, a very short beard, blond hair, and blue eyes. He is quite athletic too. The other boy is Alphonso, a good-looking Colombian boy who immigrated with his family a decade before. He became friends with Matt very fast, and they always hung out together, almost like two very close brothers.  Sure that boy is cute with his toned body, black hair, and eyes.  They were never real evidence that the two boys were gay or having any physical contact with each other. But they sure like to do their special handshakes followed by tight hugs.<br />
<br />
Mickey John was fascinated by those boys&#39; friendship. They did lots of school projects together,  volunteering to clean woods, shores, and parks, also helping senior citizens, etc.  Such good citizens who were always ready to help. But that day, they were just relaxing under the sun, only wearing short shorts and having a sunbath.  So, very confident, the toy-sized man left his hiding place near the bush and walked toward those perfect examples of humankind.  Yeah, he almost forgot he was 25-30 cm tall.<br />
<br />
(Mickey John)  &quot;Greeting, Matt and Alphonso, I thought to simply saluting you both and tell you that we all appreciate you in the neighbourhood!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys heard the tiny voice, but as they were laid on their back, they just opened their eyes, but saw no one. Puzzled, Matt said: &quot;Who said that?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Mickey John) &quot;Turn your head, I&#39;m right beside you, Matt!&quot;<br />
<br />
(Matt) &quot;No way, what is that, some kind of joke, A toy with some kind of 2 way radios?<br />
<br />
Mickey John walked closer, but suddenly Matt and Alphonso, caught by surprise, stood up and backed off. They didn&#39;t know how to react to that strange appearance.  But the tiny man looked up at them with a friendly smile.<br />
<br />
(Mickey John) &quot;You are the nicer boys I know and it&#39;s why I decided to reveal myself.  I know you won&#39;t harm me in any way.&quot; Said while winking. <br />
<br />
Squatting, the teens had a closer look at Mickey John who was standing up, his legs slightly spread. From his point of view, he had a very broad view of those giant boys&#39; thighs, large knees, and yes, their bulges.  For a short awkward moment, no one said anything, they were just staring at each other.  Then, a little shy, Alphonso extended his hand, reaching down at the tiny man.  In his mind, Mickey John was thrilled that he was about to be touched by such a good-looking teen. But he got more than expected, the boy closed his warm but gentle hand around his body and lifted him to bring him closer to his face.  It was like having a very welcoming and warming hug.<br />
<br />
(Alphonso) &quot;Hey, I know you, you are Mr Mickey John, right? You live in the dark grey brick house at the corner of my street!<br />
<br />
(Matt) &quot;Oh yeah, I recognize you too, sir! I have been delivering your newspaper for years and you always tip me a lot plus a nice bonus every Christmas !&quot;<br />
<br />
The tiny man was happy that both knew who he was. He was not sure, at that point, if Alphonso was aware that one of his fingertips was directly touching his genitals. The combination of being hand held, the warmth, the softness of the boy&#39;s hand&#39;s skin, and his genitals being touched and pressed, finished by provoking an embarrassing erection which the boy felt, but he said nothing about it.  Mickey John blushed, but Alphonso smiled while unable to resist pressing the tiny penis a little harder to feel the firmness of it. Matt notices his friend smile.<br />
<br />
(Matt) &quot;Why are you smiling for, Alphonso?&quot;<br />
<br />
So the Colombian boy withdrew his fingertip, disclosing the tiny man&#39;s underwear tent. Without saying a word he handed the aroused tiny guy to Matt.  For some reason, Mickey John didn&#39;t understand, even though he was quite embarrassed he was also happy that he became an object of curiosity for those awesome boys. As soon as Matt held him in his left fist, he touched and rubbed the tiny erected form with his fingertip. The tiny man let him do whatever he wanted so willingly. <br />
<br />
(Mickey John) &quot;What about you guys bring me where there is no risk anyone may see us! I  would not like others to see me that tiny. It&#39;s Okay you keep me as your secret though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt came back to reality and gently put the tiny man in some kid of gym bag. They both put their t-shirt on, Alphonso picked up the bag and they went to Matt&#39;s place.</p>
