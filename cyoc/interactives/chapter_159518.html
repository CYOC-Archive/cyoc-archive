<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex’s thoughts were interrupted when his tooned phone vibrated.<br />
<br />
He checked and saw that he had four text messages- one from each of four of his teachers.<br />
<br />
The first one was from his literature teacher, Ms Capris. She was a woman in her early thirties of Greek blood, had fair skin, dark brown eyes, and shoulder-length brown, curly hair. <br />
<br />
Ms Capris had a passion for literature, and always did her best to make her class fun and exiting.<br />
<br />
Her text read as follows: <br />
<br />
“Please don’t forget to pick a book to read and do a report on. Remember that you must pick one by Monday. No pressure.”<br />
<br />
Alex watched as her I.D. pic changed to a cartoon version of herself with a black triangle nose, black freckles on her cheeks, fluffy goat ears poking through her hair, and goat horns that curved around her ears. For some reason, instead of “goat “, the word  “satyress” entered Alex’s mind.<br />
<br />
The second one was from his math teacher Ms Harris. She was in her late twenties, had short, straight red hair, fair skin, and green eyes. She also wore glasses.<br />
<br />
Ms Harris liked to teach her class, but secretly wanted children of her own. Because her job had left her no time for a relationship, she did her best to teach her students, and better them as if they were her own kids.<br />
<br />
Her text read as follows:<br />
<br />
“Our new lesson begins this Monday, so be ready.”<br />
<br />
Alex watched as her I.D. pic changed to a cartoon rabbit woman with a pink triangle nose.<br />
<br />
“Because no one is better at multiplication than rabbits!” he thought to himself with a dopey grin on his chocolate lab muzzle, mentally kicking himself for the bad joke.<br />
<br />
The third one was from his science teacher, Ms Roberts. She was in her late thirties, had short, straight white hair, light brown eyes, and pale skin. Ms Roberts loved teaching science, and some said she got a bit too excited about it.<br />
<br />
Her text read as follows: <br />
<br />
“This Monday, we’ll be starting our lesson on atoms! Doesn’t that sound fun? Partners will be picked from names drawn from a hat.”<br />
<br />
Alex watched as her I.D. pic changed to a cartoon mouse woman with a pink ball nose.<br />
<br />
Last was the text from his history teacher, Ms Cleo. She was an African American woman in her mid-thirties with short, curly black hair, dark brown eyes, and smooth chocolate skin. She was tough, but fair. Of all Alex’s teachers, she was the strictest, but she still meant well.<br />
<br />
Her text read as follows:<br />
<br />
“Don’t forget to study for your Egyptian history test. It will be this Monday.”<br />
<br />
Alex watched as her I.D. pic changed to a cartoon version of herself with a black triangle nose fuzzy lioness ears poking out of her hair, and a pair of gold wings behind her head. He guessed this meant she was a sphinx.<br />
<br />
Before Alex’s brain had time to fully process all of this, he got a call from his best friend Don. Don had short black hair, tan skin, brown eyes, and often got into trouble.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Alex!” he said “Got time to shoot a few hoops with me?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Don,” he replied, not sure how he managed to talk with his new muzzle “but I’ve gotta study for my history test this Monday.” At least this gave him an excuse.<br />
<br />
“Fine. I get it. School comes first.” Don replied “Then later, ok?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure. Bye.” and he hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
No sooner had he hung up, then he saw Don’s I.D. pic turn into a cartoon donkey boy. “Fitting for such a Jackass!” he thought to himself with a grin.<br />
<br />
He then got a call from Frida, his ex-girlfriend. She had waist-length blonde hair dyed pink, and green eyes. In the past, she’d dumped him for a football jock, only to be dumped herself. <br />
<br />
“Hey Alex,” she said nervously, “I’ve had some time to think, and I realize I made a big mistake leaving you. Please take me back.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll think about it,” he replied, suppressing the urge to bark at her “I have to study for my history test.”<br />
<br />
“Ok then. That’s cool.” she replied “Get back to me when you can, ok?” <br />
<br />
“Sure.” he replied, and hung up the phone. He watched as her I.D. pic changed to a cartoon poodle girl with a pink ball nose. <br />
<br />
“Suits a bitch like her.” he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Next, he got a call from Steve, his friend from the Drama club. He had short brown hair, and wore glasses. He always had work on his mind.<br />
<br />
“Hi Alex.” he told him “Found anything for the club?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Alex replied nervously.<br />
<br />
“Great!” Steve replied “Please show me when you get the chance.” and he hung up before Alex could get another word in.<br />
<br />
Alex watched as his I.D. pic changed to a cartoon beaver with a black triangle nose, and he still had glasses. Alex just smiled at this.<br />
<br />
He then got a call from Zoe. She had orange curly hair that was waist-length with green eyes, and freckles on her face. He had known her since kindergarten, and they had always been good friends, but since his breakup with Frida, he was considering taking their relationship to the next level.<br />
<br />
“Hi Alex!” she said happily.<br />
<br />
“Hi Zoe.” he nervously told her “I don’t have time right now. I have to study for my history test this Monday.”<br />
<br />
“That’s ok.” she told him “Me too. Why don’t we study together? We can be study-buddies!”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good.” he replied.<br />
<br />
“Great!” she happily replied “I’ll be right over!” and she hung up before he could say anything else.<br />
<br />
He watched as her I.D. pic turned into a cartoon monkey girl with a black triangle nose. This made his tail wag as he smiled.<br />
<br />
His mom then called him, reminding him to pick up his five year old little sister from dance class later, and he agreed. After he hung up, he saw her I.D. pic become a cartoon kangaroo woman with a pink ball nose. At first, he wondered why his mom would be a kangaroo if he was becoming a dog, but then he remembered that cartoons don’t have to make sense as long as they’re funny.<br />
<br />
Unknown to him, each of them would become their inner toon, with toony personalities to match.</p>
