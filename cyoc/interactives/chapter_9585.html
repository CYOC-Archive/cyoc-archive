<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris continued to stare at Don. &quot;I’m growing... right?!?&quot; Don asked nervously. &quot;Oh yeah, you are&quot;.<br />
<br />
He looked now to be a foot tall... still growing... <br />
<br />
Don looked around the room. It wasn’t as big as it looked before, when he had just been set down. no, not even the table looked so big. Don looked down again- &quot;Whoa... this is making me dizzy...&quot; he said to Chris, who looked on, bewildered by the whole situation. He feared it for himself... What if this shrinking stuff spread? What would he do? <br />
<br />
Don knew he was naked, but also knew his nakedness was becoming more visible the more he grew. He tried to act calmly... as calmly as he could with this giant peering on, watching his every move. He moved over to his clothes... they didn’t seem so huge anymore, not nearly as big as when was sitting on the bathroom floor. &quot;I wonder how tall i am?&quot; he said loudly... Chris looked on, still in shock...<br />
<br />
&quot;uhh.... I dunno... maybe a foot and a half?&quot; Chris replied hesitantly. &quot;Uh... do you want me to get a ruler or something?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... i guess&quot; Don didn't seem too thrilled with this situation.. but at least he was growing...<br />
<br />
Chris ran to go grab his ruler. He went to his bedroom first, and then wandered around looking for it. Frustrated, he ran to David, his roommate’s, bedroom. He couldn’t find it there either. &quot;but i just left it... on the desk&quot; he muttered under his breath while quickly moving from room to room. Back into his own bedroom, Chris finally found it laying on the ground... well, he found something anyway... a yard stick. &quot;whatever works&quot; he said quietly.<br />
<br />
All the while Don was still growing. He now could handle his clothes, he was strong enough to move them... Don sat down at the edge of the table and began to hang his legs over the edge... watching them grow longer all the while- his hands, his torso, everything was growing... rather quickly too. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've got one!&quot; Chris yelled. And ran back through the small living room and to the kitchen. &quot;Whoa!&quot; he exclaimed upon seeing Don... now larger and with his legs nonchalantly hanging from the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;ok, i got a yard stick... lets measure you...&quot; <br />
<br />
Don sat up, standing at his full height. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn... you've grown...&quot; said Chris. Don felt a little sense of vertigo upon standing up again... everything already seemed smaller. Don stood up straight and put his back against the tall yard stick...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;2 foot 4&quot; Chris said... &quot;No wait... 2 foot 5&quot; <br />
&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Chris exclaimed... &quot;Dude, I can see you getting taller!&quot; <br />
<br />
It felt weird, Don noticed, to have your whole body expanding, and your skin rubbing up against a yard stick as you grew. Don felt it to, no less, <br />
<br />
&quot;it seemed an inch about every 2 seconds or so!&quot; Chris commented <br />
&quot;How tall am I Chris?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;2 foot 9... wait... 2 foot 10... twooo foooot 11...&quot; <br />
<br />
Don felt the yardstick coming to an end. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you're like three feet now... or so&quot;<br />
<br />
Don was getting pretty big compared to how small he'd just been. The table felt so much smaller to him now. His feet were starting to expand towards the edge of the table. And the room, and Chris were looking less and less gigantic... more... normal. <br />
<br />
Don, still naked, grabbed his shirt. It was heavy, way heavier than he was used to fabric being, but with the help of Chris, he pulled i over his body, His body just now wide enough to allow the fabric to hang from his shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;how tall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;about three-six, I'd imagine... yeah I think that’s right... more now though, Jesus!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;this is much more manageable&quot; Don said calmly. Inside though, he was thrilled that he was growing back, then this nightmare would be over... it'd be over! He was thrilled to see himself, to watch himself grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want anything to eat?&quot; Chris said, going to the refrigerator. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I'm fine&quot; Even Don's previously quiet voice was getting louder. <br />
<br />
Chris put something in a container into the microwave... leftover dinner from the night before. He closed the microwave and set the time. When Chris turned back, he was shocked again. This was too much for his eyes, who weren't able to keep pace with Don's growth. Now Chris had to look up to see Don's face , who was still standing on the table.<br />
&quot;How tall, ya think?&quot;  said a little but growing Don...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ey! I don’t know! Maybe 4 foot something?&quot; You can get down off that table now if you want... you're big enough, you know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I kinda like it this way, i feel more normal standing here... but whatever, you're table might not be able to take this for too much longer.&quot; Don then scooted to the side and without any problem, hopped off the table. <br />
<br />
It was a longer fall than Don would have liked. Now, Chris towered two feet above him, instead of being at eye level when he was standing on the table. He was also only a little above eye level of the countertops. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like a kid!&quot; He yelled at Chris. &quot;Well, you look more like normal... I guess...&quot; Chris replied. Now He would have to get his boxers back on if he wanted to stay covered. His shirt was starting to fit better with every passing second. His body filling it slightly. At first the huge sleeves had gone past his arm, but now, they were half way up his forearm. <br />
<br />
Chris turned away again to get his warmed up left over chicken out of the microwave..., which had just beeped. &quot;Now when I turn around, I just know you're going to be bigger. Chris had his back on Don for only 10 seconds or so, but again, when he turned around, Don's eyes were in a different spot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, now you can actually walk around without being a total midget!&quot; Chris exclaimed. &quot;Now you're like the height of my girlfriend!&quot; Chris joked. Don grabbed his plad boxers from off the table and put them on... They were loose, a little too loose, and he had to hold them up, but at least he wasnt totally exposed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't been this short since, like, the 7th grade… Wait, no, make that the 8th...&quot; Don said jokingly. &quot;Chris how tall are you? Anyway?&quot;<br />
Chris had always been taller than Don... &quot;About six foot three, somewhere in there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, cool&quot;<br />
<br />
Don was standing now at far more &quot;manageable&quot; height around 5'5&quot;. The countertops were beneath him now. What a wonderful feeling to be almost back to normal! Don walked around the dorm a bit, looking at the shabby furniture and the large TV. &quot;Nice... nice dorm&quot; he said to Chris. Don's boxers felt much more natural on him, and he didn’t need to hold them up anymore. The once gargantuan room was now just an average, about-average dorm. He looked at the little table that he'd been stranded on just minutes before. The roof looked lower than he was used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howabout now... how tall do I look!?&quot; Don said with a flare, his arms spread wide, and his shirt feeling much more suitable on his larger body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh!, its getting harder and harder to eye-ball it, Chris said.&quot; about 5 foot 10?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Don exclaimed. His excitement was overwhelming. Everything felt great. His shirt, his boxers, his whole body felt wonderful... back to normal! Except he still felt something... he still felt like he was growing. <br />
<br />
Don ignored it for a moment. Admiring his new view of Chris's dorm, of the kitchen, and of the table....</p>
