<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Do you mind if I join you?” a voice asked.<br />
<br />
You feel sluggish and weird all over. In fact just turning your head to meet the newcomer takes some effort. <br />
<br />
“Sure, man. Sit down” your friend replies, his voice sounding weird and hollow. <br />
<br />
“Thank you. I’m Justin” the man said. <br />
<br />
Your head feels like it’s floating but you manage to look at the guy. He appears to be in his late 20’s. He’s around 6’1, with short black hair and stubble. His athletic body, tan and elegant clothing showed that he cared about his image. And those green eyes… your mind gets lost in them, they seem to suck you in.<br />
<br />
“I’m…” you attempt to say but the words die in your throat. All you care about is the guy sitting next to you. Your buddy is acting just as strange, popping up a smile as he looks at Justin’s emerald eyes.<br />
<br />
“Don’t mind that. It’s not important at all” Justin said and you feel relief. How stupid you must have looked, not even able to say your own name.<br />
<br />
One waiter comes and brings a glass of beer to Justin, who takes a sip. You and your friend continue watching him, enthralled by his presence. Justin doesn’t mind, though and when he puts the glass down he looks at you and your friend and flashes you a white smile.<br />
<br />
You feel your cheeks warm and know you’re blushing. It doesn’t bother you that you’re acting so weirdly. In fact watching your friend act as goofily calms you.<br />
<br />
By now you feel yourself having control over your body though your mind is still hazy.<br />
<br />
“So, Justin, what do you do for a living?” your friend asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m a senior executive at HPS Technologies” he proudly said.<br />
<br />
“Senior? But you look so young?” You say, the words just coming out on their own.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sweetie. Well, let’s say I have a knack with people” He replied with another of his bright smiles.<br />
<br />
Again you blush at his words. You examine his suit: it was top fashion style all the way. His watch was also luxurious. You noted no ring on his finger and your cock begins to stir inside your pants.<br />
<br />
“Why am I getting hard? Why can’t I stop looking at him?” you think but you can’t find the answers.<br />
<br />
“May I see that watch?” You ask shyly.<br />
<br />
“Sure, come closer” Justin said and you move closer to him, your head next to his as you touch the item still on his pulse.<br />
<br />
“Limited edition. Only 150 of these were made.” His words sounded like honey so close to your ear. And his sensual scent… the expensive fragrance was so manly and overwhelming. Your hands touched the metallic bits of the watch and the clear glass but then they quietly travelled to touch his own hand. Oh, the skin-to-skin contact! It sent shivers down your spine. By now your cock was getting fuller.<br />
<br />
Your friend was pouting but then he also moved closer to Justin. Like you, he was also captivated by Justin’s sex-appeal.<br />
<br />
It should feel weird. You are not gay as wasn’t your friend. And yet here you both were adoring a random man you just met.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you both frisky tonight, huh? Let’s just enjoy our drinks, we’ll have time for that later.”<br />
<br />
You and your friend sulked for a second and returned to your places. The rational part of you was glad to put some distance between you and him but the overall disappointment was larger. <br />
<br />
More drinks arrived (especially demand by Justin). You and your friend had some colourful drinks while Justin had ordered one of his special beers. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately your horniness didn’t seem to pass. Your dick was still tenting in your underwear. It only got harder the longer you stared at Justin. A quick discreet look showed that your friend was in the same predicament. <br />
<br />
Your drink was a “surprise” as Justin had labelled it. It had swirls of red, blue, yellow and green. You somehow trusted Justin’s taste in drinks and ignored the odd colours as you took a sip. It tasted really good! It was sweet with only a slight taste of alcohol although Justin assured you both it was stronger than they might think.<br />
<br />
“So…” your friend started talking but coughed up as his voice felt strange. “Why did a man like you go alone to a bar?” He asked. His voice sounded a bit higher than usual.<br />
<br />
“Because I was looking for a good company. And it looks like I found it.” He replied after taking another sip of his beer.<br />
<br />
Both you and your friend giggled. <br />
<br />
Suddenly you began to feel an itchiness over your body. You didn’t want to scratch yourself, especially in front of Justin and so you uncomfortably sat, hoping none would notice it, only occasionally rubbing your hairy arms.<br />
<br />
Justin kept talking about his job and himself. You listened attentively. Not because it was an interesting conversation in itself but because it was Justin talking. He had a way of speech, so calm and confident that grabbed your attention.<br />
<br />
Your friend was also attentively listening to the man, only occasionally keeping a lock of black hair away from his eyes. That was strange. He didn’t have long hair but as you starred at him you realized he actually had long and curly hair. You felt almost guilty for not being attentive to your friend’s style.<br />
<br />
The needless of itchiness on your body eventually passed and you suddenly noticed that your own arms were hairless. Finding it weird you then touched your face. The scruffy beard you had was now gone. In fact your face was the smoothest it had been in years.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” Justin asked noticing your puzzled expression. Again you were blushing and your higher pitched tone replied “It’s all fine, thank you.”<br />
<br />
Justin smiled at you and you felt your heart beat faster. <br />
<br />
A little later the waiter served you and your friend yet another of that “surprise” drink. Except this one only came in one big glass with two straws. The waiter apologized saying there out glasses, which sounded weird. You were about to question that when Justin smirked and said “That won’t be a problem. You don’t mind sharing, right?”<br />
<br />
You and your friend laughed, your protests dying immediately.<br />
<br />
You moved closer to your friend to be able to drink the tasty contents. You noticed that not only did your friend have black long curly hair over his shoulders his face was hairless like yours. His face also seemed… softer, looking rather feminine. Was he always like that?<br />
<br />
You wondered about that as you passed a hand through your surprisingly long hair.<br />
<br />
“How come you don’t taste this, Justin? It’s soooo good!” your friend said.<br />
<br />
Justin laughed. “Not really my kind of drink but I knew you would both like it.”<br />
<br />
“At least take a sip!” You said.<br />
<br />
“No, no, no. I’ve drank my share already.”<br />
<br />
“Boo! You only want to make us drunk!” you said. By this point you were feeling unrestrained. The drink, Justin… everything seemed like a dream.<br />
<br />
“Someone has to take the car, after all. You can both stay at my house tonight” Justin openly invited.<br />
<br />
You and your friend looked at each other with glee. You couldn’t explain it but you wanted that so bad! <br />
<br />
Your cock was aching for being so hard. You attempted to stealthily keep it down but it wouldn’t bulge. In fact you couldn’t contain it in your underwear, which was weird. Your cock didn’t feel bigger than usual. Had your underwear suddenly shrunk?<br />
<br />
Your friend meanwhile had kept drinking.<br />
<br />
“I… oh…” he said. You took a look at him. His skin was strange. At first you thought it was a weird tan but then you noticed his skin was brown. You could have sworn you saw the darker skin overcome the paler tone on his arms. He also kept touching his chest, massaging it. He looked as if he was lost in pleasure but quickly got his composure back.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m going to the bathroom. I’ll be right back” and he quickly got up and left. You noticed that his clothes seemed weird. In front they were jeans and a shirt but in the back it looked as if the shirt and jeans were merging into something yellow.<br />
<br />
Justin and you were the only people in that part of the bar now. The sense of closeness and privacy with the stud made you blush… again.<br />
<br />
Justin let out a small laugh. “There is no need to blush. Grab your drink and come here” he said. It was both an invitation and an order. Of course you never even thought of doing anything else but that. You sat close to him. So close you were almost on his lap.<br />
<br />
“Your skin is so white and sensual” he whispered in a sexy tone as he played with a lock of your blond hair.<br />
<br />
“Oh Justin…” you moaned as you nuzzled on his strong hand.<br />
<br />
“Shh, just finish your drink” he said softly. Unable to disobey him, you drank the last contents of the cup.<br />
<br />
“There you go. Testes good, right?” he asked. One of his hands travelled downwards… lower… lower… there! His hand began rubbing your crotch, your dick reaching its full size.<br />
<br />
“Your friend is coming along nicely. But it looks like you just need a little push” he said and began rubbing your crotch with greater intensity.<br />
<br />
You could not even understand the meaning of his words, you were caught in your own pleasure.<br />
<br />
Justin didn’t jerk your penis through the clothes, instead he rubbed it and your testicles, shoving them against your body. It should have hurt but instead it was so pleasurable…<br />
<br />
You had never been so horny before but strangely enough your cock began to shrink in its size.<br />
<br />
Justin’s other hand moved to your chest and began rubbing a nipple. It was so sensitive you couldn’t help but moan, forgetting all about your shrinking cock.<br />
<br />
Soon both Justin’s hand began pinching and rubbing your nipples, leaving your cock and balls unattended. Your own hand moved to your privates to continue where Justin had left off and you rubbed them.<br />
<br />
Your nipples began to grow and your chest grew in volume. But it wasn’t muscle… you were developing breasts. Meanwhile your hand rubbed just like Justin had done. Your cock and balls were shrinking by the second and so each of your rubs began to focus on a smaller area. The pleasure was indescribable. <br />
<br />
Your clothing began to change as well. Like your friend, you had a shirt and pants but now they began to change. A bra appeared out of nowhere and cupped to the enlarging breasts. The shirt and pants became a two-piece dress showing your nude and flat abdomen. Your hand rubbed easier without the jeans on the way, there was only panties underneath the dress. Soon enough you couldn’t even feel your cock and balls. It seemed as if they had disappeared. Still, oddly enough you kept feeling pleasure while rubbing a small sensitive spot on your crotch.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly Justin stopped rubbing your chest and removed your hand from your privates. Your nails had grown and even your hand looked like they had just left the manicure. <br />
<br />
“Why, Justin? I…” your voice was a mix of pleasure and disappointment.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have time for that later, Claire. Look here comes Tina.”<br />
<br />
Claire… Tina? Those names seemed familiar to you.<br />
<br />
You regained your composure as a beautiful dark skinned woman entered, wearing a sexy yellow dress. Her breasts were larger than yours, which made you envious.<br />
<br />
“Ready to go? I’ll go pay the drinks” Justin said.<br />
<br />
“Just a minute, Justin” your friend said “we need a little girl time.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t take long, ladies” Justin said as he went to pay for the drinks.<br />
<br />
Your friend led you to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Claire, you silly girl. You forgot your purse in the bathroom!” the other woman said. “And your makeup’s out. Let me take care of it” and she began to apply lipstick even before you had time to say anything else.<br />
<br />
This felt strange and wrong. You knew you were not a girl and yet… it felt so natural. You had conflicting memories of you and your friend but they were being swept away. Your identity as Claire was taking over and you were accepting it. You wanted to be Claire, you wanted to be a woman. And you wanted Justin to make you feel like a woman. However a stubborn part of you could not let go of those memories and despite the vague impression it gave you that this was wrong it was easier for you to accept everything that was happening.<br />
<br />
“There! All better now” Tina said. You now had lipstick and eyeliner and some sparkles on your face. Your golden hair was silky and straight and your white skin contrasted Tina’s darker tone.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Tina!” you said hugging your friend. “Come on, Justin’s waiting” your friend said. You both felt a tingle of pleasure thinking about Justin. “He’s so sexy” you thought.<br />
<br />
He drove you both to his apartment in his luxurious car and in no time you arrived at his magnificent house. Justin led you through the house, charmingly showing expensive paintings and sculptures but eventually you made it to the big bedroom. Justin lied on the bed and beckoned you girls to approach.<br />
<br />
You and Tina did as you were ordered, walking on all fours on the bed and nuzzling on Justin’s body.<br />
<br />
“You look so uncomfortable in those dresses. You should really take the off” Justin said.<br />
<br />
You and Tina began to slowly undress but Justin was not pleased. “No, take each other’s dresses”<br />
<br />
And so you both did, slowly and sexily getting in your underwear.<br />
<br />
A foreign feeling started to form as you looked at your breasts, trapped in a bra “I’m not… this can’t…”<br />
<br />
Slowly you started to remember. You were a man, not a girl! This was all wrong!<br />
<br />
“Tina, I think Claire is not feeling too well. Please her.”<br />
<br />
And with no words, Tina approached you. By now your buried memories started to resurface. Justin! It had to be Justin! He must have done… “Oh” you moaned as Tina kissed your neck.<br />
<br />
You had to fight this! You had to bring your friend to reason before it was too late!<br />
<br />
“Tina!” you shouted in a mix of panic and pleasure. No… her name wasn’t Tina. She wasn’t a black woman, in fact she wasn’t a woman at all! “You’ve got to stop this, Tina.” You said. However the other woman ignored your plea and her kisses travelled up your neck.<br />
<br />
In panic you starred at Justin, who was grinning. “You did this! Make it stop!”<br />
<br />
“Relax, Claire. You want this… you know it.” He calmly said.<br />
<br />
You attempted to say something but your mouth was unexpectedly covered by Tina’s. Her intrusive tongue explored your mouth. You attempted to push her off you but it was a half-hearted effort. You enjoyed that intruder inside and soon you started to kiss back.<br />
<br />
Tina began to take off your bra and your hands did the same to Tina.<br />
<br />
The feeling of your freed breasts was a relief and pleasure that overwhelmed you. Tina’s hands travelled up your body, rubbing and caressing your sensitive skin and breasts. <br />
<br />
“Tina, come to me” Justin said and at once the other woman left you, while giving you a sly wink and crawled next to Justin.<br />
<br />
You felt empty, like Justin had taken your favourite toy from you.<br />
<br />
“Undress me, Tina” he commanded and she did as she was told, starting by his suit jacket.<br />
<br />
You were in a crossroads. Your mind was again your own but Justin’s hold on you and your own lust were enormous. You wanted to make your friend stop, call him to reason and leave as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
“What… have you done?” You asked Justin, who was enjoying the moment as Tina started opening his shirt and licking the nude torso underneath.<br />
<br />
“I don’t owe you an explanation. Remember the bar? I helped you… remember my touch? The way you moaned and wanted more? Now you come to my house and start being an ungrateful pest?”<br />
<br />
His harsh tone hurt you. Still the memory of his hand on your nipples and crotch was starting to make you horny. You started to become wet.<br />
<br />
The corrupted part of you felt that you owed Justin for the pleasures you had been feeling but your willpower was stronger than that.<br />
<br />
“Shut up! I want my body back, I want my friend back! I don’t know what you did but just reverse it! We are not your playthings!” <br />
<br />
“Your friend doesn’t seem to mind” he said as Tina finally took off his shirt, leaving a hairy and muscular torso revealed. <br />
<br />
A feeling of jealousy ran through you as you saw her serve that handsome man. “Please, please. Just give back our lives. We won’t tell…” You begged.<br />
<br />
“Why would I do that, Claire? You and Tina are such beautiful women. Why must you fight? I’m already yours and you’re already mine. Come take the prize” Justin said, taking off his pants with Tina’s help.<br />
<br />
You were feeling hornier than ever before. The tented cock on Justin’s pants looked so tempting… you were getting wetter, staining your panties. Your mind was getting split: you wanted your own cock and balls back but as you watched the package of the only man in the room you realized you wanted that cock… in your mouth and in your pussy. You moved a hand to your needy sex. You just couldn’t fight the horniness. In no time you took off your panties and began rubbing your clit.<br />
<br />
The pleasure was overwhelming. Who knew women were so sensitive down there?<br />
<br />
Justin meanwhile payed no mind to you as he sucked on Tina’s hard nipple. You felt left out but you couldn’t degrade yourself and surrender your body to Justin but at the same time you realized you couldn’t run away from him either. You saw Justin’s tented member grow in size. Bigger and bigger it got. It had to be 7’5 inches long and it was so thick… You crawled to Justin, no longer able to contain your lust. You wanted… no, needed to see it.<br />
<br />
You took off his underwear, exposing his large dick. However before you could anything to that thick pole, Justin let go of Tina and fast enough grabbed you, getting himself on top of you.<br />
<br />
“Well, well. Are you finally ready to become mine?” He asked. Your strong willpower was eroding but still you refused to give in to him.<br />
<br />
You then began to feel his cock touching your cunt. He didn’t make an effort to penetrate you, he just rubbed your hole with his member. You whined in need.<br />
<br />
“Say you want it” Justin said.<br />
<br />
“I… I want it!” You admitted. <br />
<br />
“Put a little more effort than that” Justin said maliciously as he moved back. The moment you stopped feeling that hard member so close to your needy hole you nearly cried in need. “Please! Please fuck my hole. Do it. I’ll never disobey you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s better. Tell me Claire. Do you want your old life back, and Tina’s by the way, or my cock inside you?”<br />
<br />
“Please, I need your cock!” You yell at once in lust.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Justin at last pierced your vagina. And began to hump against you.<br />
<br />
You moaned in pleasure, having finally given in. The old memories turned to nothing as you finally fully accepted your identity as a woman.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Tina appeared beside you and with your eyes fixes on her breasts you began to lick and suck on them. It was all so strange and new and yet somehow familiar. You moaned as Justin filled you with his cock.<br />
<br />
Eventually he withdrew his cock from you and made you lie on your stomach. He again began ramming against your sex, while commanding you lick Tina’s pussy. Obeying him immediately you began to pleasure your friend.<br />
<br />
The night went on. Your entire body became a toy for Tina and Justin. You couldn’t say no. nor did you want to. You and your friend shared the passion Justin gave you. You had never felt such bliss and complete before. You both craved for one more touch, one more kiss and for that gorgeous cock to penetrate you again and again. You both worshipped Justin and he made sure to please you both, leaving you panting and satisfied by the end of the night.<br />
<br />
With Justin’s toned arm around your body you and your friend Tina descended into a long and deep sleep, with smiles on your faces.</p>
