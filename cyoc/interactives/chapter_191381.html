<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Eric...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Both were absolutely bewildered by what they were seeing. As far as Henry was concerned, this broke any and all biochemical laws of development or possibility...but there was no doubting what he was seeing. He...he was gloriously buff. Chiseled. Probably bigger than the vast majority of the students at the school, even including the jocks. Yeah, Henry thought as he flexed his bicep and watched the peak surge up to a very stirring display, I&#39;m looking good today. How this could even be possible, Henry decided he could look into later. After all, you don&#39;t very often get a gift like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Eric stated, &quot;Look at us! We&#39;ve transcended our physical limitations! Ooh, check out my chest!&quot; Eric was really in the midst of enjoying it. It was Eric&#39;s vain displays and cheeky grin as he cupped his groin that made Henry realize something else had happened too. Horny...! Henry gulped and looked down at his groin, realizing that perhaps whatever sex hormones were released in the course of the growth, they were involved in...pushing them toward libidinous extremes...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn dude, you look almost more turned on than me!&quot; Eric chuckled and Henry shook his head...<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t just go about rampantly indulging our carnal impulses! Just think about it, man,&quot; Henry looked at their school work. Never had it seemed so distant from him, perhaps owing to his increase in height...or just as likely, his increase in sheer fitness. He had always thought it would be by his school work that he would see his chances for romance and advancement increase. But now? Now he was a-a freaking bodybuilder. Just out of nowhere. He couldn&#39;t help but contemplate...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, man,&quot; Eric said with a chuckle, &quot;I know that look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What look?&quot; Henry crossed his arms. Both in irritation and to get his mind off of his needy manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re overthinking things again. We got an amazing gift out of it. Whatever drinking that coffee I am guessing gave us,&quot; Eric said with a shrug, &quot;You&#39;re looking a gift horse in the mouth. There can&#39;t be anything wrong with us when we feel this good. Am I right? Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Henry conceded. He didn&#39;t want to just go ahead and give it up to Eric at that point. But he could concede that perhaps he was overthinking things. Eric was always the slightly more outgoing of the two. Whenever there was a stalemate between their approaches, Henry would try to go with Eric&#39;s more daring ideas to jar them out of whatever state they&#39;d gotten themselves into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I really wanna go and see if any of the lovely ladies of the campus want to get to know all of the new Eric,&quot; the nerd said with a grin, &quot;But I am already feeling so resplendently turned on I fear one thrust into a wet pussy might well spell ejaculation for me. You know what I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry had to admit Eric had a point, as vulgar as it was. They were indeed massively muscled, and strong as fuck, surely enough to bring around a number of willing mates, but right now they were just too turned on. They needed to cool their jets as it were. They needed to satiate themselves in the here and now as opposed to chasing after some licentious ladies who might be disappointed by their lack of endurance and over-excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we doing?&quot; Henry asked with a coy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re jacking off, my friend.&quot; With that, Henry blinked as he saw Eric gingerly take off his strained boxers and whip them around with a single finger before smacking them into the floor. Eric took a seat and started eagerly pistoning his fist again and again over his eager, red and excited cock. Witnessing such a thing got Henry&#39;s engines moving again - he was straight, but such a profuse display of sexuality was enough to get him moving.<br />
<br />
Henry looked around and took a seat about three feet away from Eric, moving his boxers off of him and to the side. Henry was outright astonished by his sheer sensitivity, it was like nothing he had ever experienced before. He remembered his first time jerking off, discovering the astonishing pornographic records of the internet, but this was...this was fresh! It was a sensitivity at once foreign to Henry, and he had to actively resist cumming straight away. He was a nerd, but he didn&#39;t want to be a quickshot!<br />
<br />
Mm...fuck. Henry eagerly approached a more balanced sort of approach. Speeding up, but then slowing down just enough to really appreciate the flexion of his musculature, the way his forearm tensed when his hand reached the base, and then released when he got to the head of the cock. He couldn&#39;t help himself but flex...<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you imaging your ex-girlfriend, my man?&quot; Henry asked as he saw Eric merrily stroking those few feet away. He remembered Eric&#39;s ex, Bethany and her tremendous tits. Her ass was kind of average, but fuck those were amazing tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it...mm, fuck, are you---are you trying to engage in erotic subterfuge on me, Henry?&quot; Eric asked as he gave an involuntary pump of the hips. Eric had to slow down lest he indeed end up cumming all over himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me, Eric!&quot; Henry said, pausing a little - albeit unwisely - at the top of a stroke at the head, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t interfere in your satisfaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why would you---you ask me---a-about my sweet, hot ex-girlfriend?&quot; Eric gulped and fought back down a near orgasm then and there. Fuck but he had never done this kind of thing recently with Henry. They did it before college, often even, and even chatted about their recent romantic luck or lack thereof. Eric was the only one between the two of them who had a girlfriend at all, a fact he had enjoyed lording over Henry in a jesting sort of way. So he supposed if Henry was indeed jabbing at him in such a way, he couldn&#39;t exactly complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buh---Because I wanna know, what&#39;s making you leak over there?&quot; Henry said, pumping his hips and almost falling forward. Such was their game - whoever came first usually had to do some sort of favor for the other. And as of now it was a real ask for which one might end up with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leaking...oh! Oh! I see.&quot; Eric gulped, and his hand awkwardly shifted over his manhood, &quot;I-I&#39;ve never leaked quite like that before. Fuck, I&#39;ve never been this turned on before...&quot;<br />
<br />
However, even as it looked like Henry was about to win, Eric managed to hang on just long enough as Henry committed one fatal mistake. He imagined himself burying his newly long cock in Beth&#39;s enormous tits. Henry found himself lurching forward, gasping, trying desperately to course correct. But he was at that point in orgiastic pleasure where one cannot stop the cum flowing up the shaft, heading right for---for emission! Henry lurched on to his hands and knees, despite how embarrassing the position would look.<br />
<br />
Henry gasped, &quot;Fuck! Fuck fuck, you win this round! I&#39;m cumming!!&quot; Henry humped the imaginary woman fiercely as his hips and thighs flexed, his sphincter clenching just in time as he felt it surge right through his whole body before collecting and intensifying in his manhood. It was an altogether foreign orgasm, something both like and unlike all others Henry had experienced. Muscles tightening and sensitive nipples standing up, Henry felt one---two---three jets of cum smack against the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!!&quot; Henry cursed at himself, knowing he had nobody to blame for that sorry performance but himself. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m...I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cumming!!&quot; Eric was not far behind. Henry looked away as he heard Eric gasping for air as he pumped his hips, bursts of semen going up and landing on Eric&#39;s arms, legs and chest. When he was sure it was done, Henry looked over in time to see Eric fetching a pair of hand towels. Henry caught one of them tossed at him, and both started cleaning up the mess. What a strange time that was, Henry thought as they cleaned the mess up.<br />
<br />
But how very welcome.<br />
<br />
He now knew his limits much more readily, and it seemed his newly muscled build had some advantages and disadvantages. For one due to how excited he was by it, it seemed he was much more easily turned on. Which could mean bad things, Henry realized, for his stamina. But with how ripped he was, he guessed that it might make erotic encounters easier. So...getting more dates, and easier, but any hedonistic activities might well be cut short.<br />
<br />
You win some, Henry thought, you lose some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Eric said with a lazy grin once they were done. Both tossed their towels in the dirty clothes hamper to be washed, and then the &quot;winner&quot; continued, &quot;I won our little game, Henry, which means you have to do a little favor. And I&#39;m thinking it involves the secret of our muscular advancement. As good as we&#39;re looking now, I&#39;m thinking we require a little more. My guess is the variable is our drink, the latte. Go out and return with another latte.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry tilted his head, admittedly, he felt a little bit cautious about this, but thinking about his new body - and how much better it could get with a little more - that just eased him out of his wariness. Henry nodded, &quot;While I&#39;m still not sure if this hypothesis holds water, I&#39;m willing to entertain it until it can be turned into a theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry got dressed in a large polo shirt and jeans, pleased by how these clothes, once billowing on him, now fit him snugly and even seemed like they flirtatiously displayed his body. Before long, he hurried out to get a new pair of drinks. Not knowing what may come as a result.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Before long, Henry returned, finding that he could run and move much more easily now. He might&#39;ve thought his newly heavily muscled build might make him slightly less fleet on his feet, but now, it seemed his legs were every bit as strong and powerful as everything else. If anything Henry felt the slightest bit more curious about his strength. Perhaps it might be worth experimentation, he considered, going into the domain of the jocks at the school - the gym. Purely to test out his new gains.<br />
<br />
There had to be some girls there that might be interested in a rippling physical specimen.<br />
<br />
He remembered the woman who handled physical therapy at the school, and how she always hanged around the gym. Alice, her name was. Henry grinned a little. Alice was a 27 year old physical therapist with ponytail tied blond hair, blue-green eyes, and a slightly tan look. She was athletic in a lean way, quite busty, and her ass always drew attention in those school issued pants she wore. Henry swore she probably wore a size too small for her---<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you bring the drinks, Henry? I&#39;m eager to test my hypothesis!&quot; There was Eric, sounding excited - it seemed his recent muscular growth had him eager for further experimentation.<br />
<br />
When Henry entered the room, he saw Eric just sitting there in a pair of somewhat larger boxers. Still hugging to his cock and ass, but he had neglected to put on any clothes beyond the boxers. Perhaps anticipating positive results from another dose, possibly just feeling like constantly having his new muscles in sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has this recent growth made you a nudist?&quot; Henry ribbed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, I&#39;m not those jocks, so eager to show off,&quot; Eric responded, &quot;I&#39;m just...familiarizing myself. While you were gone I utilized several body weight exercises to find where my strength is. But I believe only a trip to the gym might suffice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here are our drinks. To progress!&quot; Henry said as he put one of them over by Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;To progress.&quot; And with that, both of them drank their next dose, awaiting whatever may come with it. Henry didn&#39;t know if it truly was the drink that brought on their growth. Eric guessed it was and as such eagerly desired another shot in order to see how much further his body could go...<br />
<br />
And then both of them felt a strong tingling sensation spreading over their bodies. &quot;Ohh, here we go!&quot; Eric laid back, eager to get this underway.</p>
