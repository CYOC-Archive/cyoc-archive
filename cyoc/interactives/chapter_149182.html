<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The aliens who reshaped Earth into its slovenly form were called tunisias, a race of velociraptor-like hominids. They have short snouts with thin nostrils, a variety of horn shapes, long arms with thick four fingered hands, three-toed feet on digitigrade legs, and long lizard-like tails. Their skin is leathery and tends to take on colors ranging from green to brown. Males tend to run slightly larger and more muscular, but all tunisias look like they could be appealing mascot characters. Females develop feathers on their craniums, which they are able to style like hair. Despite their reptilian appearance, tunisias are actually warm-blooded creatures, a trait not dissimilar to birds or mammals. They&#39;re carnivorous in nature, primarily feeding on poultry, rodents, large herbivores like cows, and insects. They are an exceptionally intelligent and clever species, having developed FTL technology thanks to their discovery of Excuseum, an incredible energy source.<br />
<br />
The tunisias who first came to Earth worked for the Lom&#39;baal Excuseum Company, a large energy firm. They are the only Tunisia energy company on Earth to this day, ever since securing exclusive colony rights in 2074. Ever since then, many other tunisias have come to live on Earth amongst the slobby humans, whom they&#39;ve come to love dearly. Many of them came seeking out new careers, like the invaluable produce farming or livestock ranching. Some work office jobs or food service positions. Some become janitors who prevent fecal matter from  piling up too much. The most coveted of jobs, however, is that of a personal caretaker to a feedee and feeder couple.<br />
<br />
Rel&#39;haan is one such caretaker. She is a pea green tunisia who lives with the Gassenbrap couple, Glinda and Delia. Rel&#39;haan wears a french maid&#39;s headpiece and ties a soft pink ribbon bow around her neck, otherwise she is as naked as her slobs. Glinda&#39;s the Feedee, weighing 842 pounds of unwashed apple shaped flesh. She&#39;s has frizzy ginger hair that&#39;s as greasy as a deep fryer&#39;s trap, bright green eyes, and freckles on her cheeks, shoulders, nose, and large saggy breasts. Delia&#39;s the feeder, weighing 180 pounds even and slightly pear shaped. She has long and straight black hair that reaches to the floor and is of similar greasiness to her partner&#39;s. Her eyes are crystal blue and her skin is as pale as a doll. The three of them are like a happy family.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Today was the beginning of another great day in the life of Rel&#39;haan. She&#39;d fallen asleep on top of Glinda, curled up like a kitten on top of her vast stomach. Glinda was still asleep, snoring a tad loudly. Rel&#39;haan awoke with a stretch and a yawn, and was ready to get to work. First, she had to make sure her girls were having healthy nocturnal bowel movements, and shovel their poop into the feces recycling bin. (Long story short, they had relieved themselves in their sleep, and quite a bit as well.) Delia was already awake and cooking breakfast, so the alien went to help so the feeder could bring the first course to her darling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bon-morning, Mrs Delia,&quot; Rel&#39;haan greeted her human as she entered the kitchen, &quot;Sleep good, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Relly,&quot; Delia smiled at her caretaker, &quot;I had a lovely dream last night. I dreamed that I was a mermaid who swam in an ocean of my darling&#39;s urine. My Glinda was there as the Goddess of the ocean, and you were a friendly fish who brought us biscuits and tea. Oh it was so lovely!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dream sounded lovely, yes,&quot; Rel&#39;haan agreed, &quot;Rel&#39;haan can take over frying bacon and flipping pancakes for Mrs Delia. Let Mrs Delia feed her darling Mrs Glinda, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why of course,&quot; Delia agreed, &quot;It would be my pleasure to let you help. Thank you, Relly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is being no problem,&quot; Rel&#39;haan brushed off, &quot;Rel&#39;haan happy to serve.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Delia loaded the first round of breakfast onto a large cart, she explained the rest of the breakfast menu for the morning. Glinda was having two whole rashers of bacon, extra fatty, twenty pounds of pancakes drenched in Ms Butterworth&#39;s, three dozen chocolaty yeast donuts, two loaves of buttered toast, a cheese omelette made with a dozen eggs, four liters of orange juice, two gallons of milk, and a gallon of diced melon.<br />
Delia would be having three strips of bacon, two pancakes drenched in Ms Butterworth&#39;s, one donut, one slice of toast halved, a cheese omelette made with two eggs, a glass each of orange juice and milk, and a cup of diced melon.<br />
Rel&#39;haan would have at least a rasher of bacon to herself, an omelette made with six eggs, and a glass of milk. Maybe a live rat or two if one were to scamper out.<br />
<br />
With that, Rel&#39;haan got to work cooking up a storm. Cooking was her favorite thing to do for her humans, and she was spectacular at it as well. She knew just the right spices to use, just the right herbs to combine, just the right amount of salt and oil to add (which was always plenty), and which flavors complimented each other the best. Life as the Gassenbrap family caretaker was rife with chances to flex her culinary prowess, and she couldn&#39;t be any prouder.<br />
<br />
Delia was feeding her darling Glinda by hand, having woken her up by waving bacon in front of her nose. The two slovenly women were smitten with each other ever since they first met a few years ago. Back then, Delia had just gotten over a nasty breakup with a different feedee. Not only was the sting of breaking up with her old girlfriend bad enough, but without a feedee a feeder becomes horrendously depressed, like their life is without purpose. For a few weeks she could be seen walking around town, barely finding the motivation to eat, feeling no pleasure from her incontinent sensations, and just constantly weeping. Her mothers and her other feeder friends would try to cheer her up, but nothing truly could until the day she ran into the girl who changed her life forever.<br />
<br />
Glinda had just moved to town, and in those days she only weighed around 300 pounds. She was a feedee at heart, but without a feeder she had to get most of her food herself. Of course, since she also had to pay for her house and utilities, that meant having to sacrifice meals. She was looking around town for some kind of matchmaking service when she locked eyes with just the daintiest porcelain doll of a girl. She looked like she&#39;d spent the worst half of a month crying her eyes out, but the minute they met, Delia&#39;s face lit up with excitement and joy. Glinda knew right then and there that she wanted this precious, beautiful girl to stuff her full of love and food for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
Ever since then, they&#39;ve been together. Delia moved in with Glinda not long after, and two years later they were married. As their relationship progressed, so did Glinda&#39;s waistline, until eventually the gargantuan slob had to have anti-gravity devices surgically implanted into her skeleton. One day, they met Rel&#39;haan at the grocery store. At the time the alien worked in the deli. They&#39;d have conversations occasionally, and on her days off the alien would visit them. They found out that it was always her dream to be a great caretaker, and they decided that they could use the extra help taking care of their messes when it threatened to overtake their house. Soon, Rel&#39;haan was able to move in with them, quit her deli job, and become a professional caretaker. They&#39;ve been like one happy family ever since.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
After breakfast, Rel&#39;haan got to work putting up the dishes. She didn&#39;t need to wash them, since that was how the slobs liked it. The donut boxes on the other hand would have to go into the cardboard recycling. Delia had dropped a few turd logs during her trips to fetch more food, so those got cleaned up. Any urine was left to stain the ground, leaving it sticky as hell and just right for the humans. A few minutes into her chores and the alien was done.<br />
<br />
Just then, Glinda and Delia came into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Rel&#39;haan,&quot; Glinda called to the alien, &quot;You havin&#39; a *BELCH* good morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zumpai, Mrs Glinda,&quot; Rel&#39;haan answered, &quot;Rel&#39;haan having good morning, yes. What brings girls into kitchen? Is needing snack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Delia stated, &quot;my darling and I were planning on going *BUrp* out for the day, and we were hoping you could come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how &#39;bout it? You game, Relly?&quot; Glinda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rel&#39;haan would love to go out with girls, yes!&quot; the alien nodded excitedly, &quot;Where going though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a secret,&quot; Glinda wagged her finger, &quot;You&#39;ll just have to wait and see!&quot;</p>
