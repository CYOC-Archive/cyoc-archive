<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was certain that Margo would have liked her to get right to work, either checking out the potential recruits in the file or talking to her friends to at least make sure she had their support. These were all important things, and in between getting ready for her big date Friday night and trying to settle into the rest of her classes, Rhonda would need to get going with all of these tasks. But for right now, everything set out by her maybe-could-be-but-it-was-still-a-bit-shaky sister would have to wait - because there was a dragon-doll girl waiting very patiently for her, and the latina had every intention to make good use of the scant time they had before she&#39;d head off to her next disaster of a class.<br />
<br />
The cafeteria was bustling by the time she reached it, flooded with lunch hour traffic from numerous girls - quite a few of which looked to be something other than purely human, evidence that Rhonda wasn&#39;t the only one who&#39;d gotten herself zapped with a transformation or two. She could only wonder if this was actually any better than how things usually looked a few days into the school year, but not for long, as in short order her eyes spotted a table at which several girls were seated, two of which had sets of wings poking up above the heads of other students, one pair slimy and the other doll-like. May and Sofia, undoubtedly; a quickl glance around confirmed that Abigail wasn&#39;t currently here, something she&#39;d consider a plus.<br />
<br />
It was a good distance away, though, their table separated from Rhonda by a huge throng of people... but most of them were seated at tables, save for one pair of driders snacking up on the ceiling. Her razor-sharp fangs glistened as she got an idea, flapping her wings experimentally a few times before really putthing them to work, generating thrust and pushing her up off the ground. It was still a little unsteady, Rhonda having not really had the chance to practice flying with wings in a good year or so (and last time they&#39;d been feathered, not draconic), but she was quickly making her way over the heads of the student body, a few girls oohing and ahhing at the display while others rolled their eyes or groaned.<br />
<br />
At her destination, the results were as mixed as she expected. Sofia had a palm to her forehead as her friend came in for a slightly rough landing, muttering obscenities in German under her breath. But Lichi and May were ecstatic, both clapping and cheering at the little flight. She couldn&#39;t help but take a small bow, Lichi in particular getting excited as she visually examined the multiple limbs and extra rack that Rhonda now bore. She really was kind of starting to like the stares and people checking her out - for once, it felt like people in general cared about her a lot more than Sofia. Exactly the opposite of what she&#39;d expected from this school, but hey, who was she to complain?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you have <i>got</i> to teach me how to do that!&quot; May exclaimed as she stood up, grabbing an untouched plate off the table and placing it in Rhonda&#39;s hands. The enchantment fired instantly, causing a little surge of magical energy to appear that quickly materialized into a meal that would perfectly suit the diner&#39;s dietary needs: a very spicy slab of beef. Alright, that... that wasn&#39;t what she usually ate, but she found it immediately appetizing, grabbing the meat in one hand and tossing the plate back to the table with another as she started chowing down. This, of course, still left two hands to grasp May&#39;s, holding them gently as she stared into the other dragonmorph&#39;s slitted eyes. <br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t need to share a word - which was good, seeing as how Rhonda&#39;s mouth was full. May gave her lower pair of hands a gentle squeeze before adjusting her grip to hold onto one of the latina&#39;s arms, pulling her off towards the nearest exit. &quot;See you guys later!&quot; she called out to Sofia and Lichi, the duo waving with an almost totally inverted degree of enthusiasm - Lichi seemed as excited as ever, Sofia seemed like she wanted to pass out. That they were now being left alone at the table together was a recipie for disaster, but it would be a disaster that played out elsewhere, as May quickly dragged them out into the hallway and off into the first empty room she could find, jamming the door shut with a chair behind them.<br />
<br />
The rather juicy steak was finished off just in time for May to turn back to Rhonda and throw her arms around the other girl&#39;s shoulders, her many-jointed tail twisting around her back to draw her in closer. An eyebrow raised, Rhonda tilted her head, slitted eyes admiring every inch of the scaly framing around the other girl&#39;s face. &quot;Well, this room&#39;s too small for flying, so... what did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
May did her best to put up a confident smirk, but the slight blush in her smooth face made it evident that she was feeling some anxiety over the whole situation, something that didn&#39;t abate as all four of Rhonda&#39;s arms held the girl in tight. &quot;Promise you won&#39;t make fun of me, no matter what it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhonda nodded without hestiation, causing May to let out a small sigh of relief. &quot;Well, the truth is, I&#39;d... really like to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her heart skipped a beat as she waited for May to finish the thought. &quot;...cuddle.&quot;<br />
<br />
...wait what.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh, uh... I mean... yeah, that... that&#39;d be fine.&quot; She blinked rapidly. That was... that was a lot more innocuous than what she thought May was about to propose. And a good thing, because for as confident and sexy as she felt with this draconic body... she&#39;d still never actually gone beyond kissing with another girl. Her utter lack of experience with more physical matters - which was itself incredible given the usual nature of magical transformations - would be hidden for another wee while. &quot;Just like... standing up, or on the floor, or-&quot;<br />
<br />
She got her answer with a yelp as May suddenly picked her up, carrying the dragonmorph in her arms with ease - apparently, she&#39;d gotten the enhanced strength that came with being draconic. She&#39;d have to remember that Abigail likely also had the same power, but for now, her focus was still on the doll-girl taking her over to an empty teacher&#39;s chair at the head of the room, plopping down, and resting Rhonda on her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; the girl said, rubbing Rhonda&#39;s back with one hand while using her other to draw in the latina&#39;s legs. &quot;I know it&#39;s a bit weird, but... I like holding people. Especially people I care about. It just... makes me feel nice, you know? Like... like uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you&#39;re not alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
May let out a sigh. &quot;Yeah. That.&quot; She glanced around, seeming to need a moment to gather her courage before she could look Rhonda in the eye again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I seem like a weirdo, o-or if I&#39;m being really forward, I just... you&#39;re... you&#39;re really, <i>really</i> amazing. I don&#39;t know how you don&#39;t have half the school beating down your door to ask you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her first instinct was to tell May to hold that thought, at the rate attention was being drawn to her, but she figured it best to keep that thought to herself. Instead, she brought up a hand to cup May&#39;s face, thumb rubbing back and forth to caress the smooth skin. &quot;They all know that you&#39;re the one I want. Leaves them kind of hopeless, really, the idea of having to compete with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a little flatterer, know that?&quot; She grinned and closed her eyes, resting her forehead against Rhonda&#39;s and throwing her feet up onto the teacher&#39;s desk. &quot;What are you, planning to go into politics?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be.&quot; For now, though, politics was the last thing on her mind. She was more than content to silently smile and curl herself up with May for the rest of their lunch break, tails merrily wrapping around the other girl&#39;s legs and wings drawing around them like a protective cocoon. Just... calm. A whole lot of quiet, no world-ending mermaid plagues, no colors out of space, no people turning her into freakish monsters. Just a few minutes she got spend wrapped up with somebody she liked, who liked her back, no hustle or fuss or disaster.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d been cheerfully excited at various points since starting here - but for the first time in a few days, Rhonda just felt calm, warm, relaxed... <i>happy</i>. That feeling alone was worth another hundred bizarre transformations.</p>
