<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Open-minded man seeks quick and passionate sexual relationships for mutual enjoyment. That was what Alex saw when he clicked through the list of profiles on the app and saw Chad - listed as a straight man on the app - and found himself thinking back to last night. The way the roided up gym hunk, in his photo on the app baring his chest and prominent abs, casually discussed preferences in his bio was definitely odd. Maybe it was how old Alex was mentally - whatever else was changing for him or anyone else, Alex had been a 60 year old man first and foremost. And so he didn&#39;t really get this kind of thing. Maybe it was something to try and talk with Chad about.<br />
<br />
Suarez looked over at what he was examining, and sighed, &quot;Dudes like that are all over apps like these. I don&#39;t get why some women go for roided up dudebros like that. I mean, they DO know right? What roids do to your balls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex did however feel somewhat relieved to note that it seemed Chad wasn&#39;t changing at all. He wasn&#39;t so oblivious that he couldn&#39;t realize something was going on. He wanted to believe it was just his clothes fitting badly, but deep down, Alex knew he would need to most likely talk with the people at the school about this. There was just the matter of his...self control. Alex had never felt quite this hormonal before. It was like he was being hit with years worth of lost libido all at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Suarez, can you help me out here?&quot; Alex said, looking at his own profile now. He needed to make a pretty steamy profile pic. He looked at the door and around at the teachers&#39; lounge. It seemed they were alone here for now. &quot;I&#39;d like to...er, make a beefcake photo for the app or two. Can you help me out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, big guy.&quot; The younger teacher responded with a shrug and took up Alex&#39;s phone. First he took a photo of Alex in his shirt, and then stepped back and started angling the phone. Not really expecting much out of the older man. But William&#39;s eyes widened when he saw Alex take his shirt off. His midsection was tightly toned, looking near on six pack abs. His shoulders were broad and powerfully built, and Alex&#39;s arms were very well toned and quite large - almost seventeen inches, obviously showing when he went to flex.<br />
<br />
Alex seemed the most surprised by this - but he kept his cool and just went through a few flexing motions for Suarez to take photos of.<br />
<br />
By the time they were done, Alex eagerly put his shirt back on, running a hand through his gray and blond hair. &quot;Thank you, Mr. Suarez.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When did YOU of all people here muscle up? How&#39;d I miss such an obvious rival?&quot; The hispanic teacher shook his head, and seemed a little dejected. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve actually started working out a while ago. I have to say, it agrees with me.&quot; Alex smiled a little in response. Admittedly, showing up the would-be casanova was not exactly mature behavior. But damn if it didn&#39;t feel good flexing his bicep and knowing Will Suarez was probably nowhere near as muscular.<br />
<br />
On top of it looking like a few other teachers were starting on some fitness programs lately, of all people Alex Clark was outflexing him. Of all people! Alex was like 60 years old! Whatever was going around here, Suarez kind of hoped he could hop on it the same as everyone else.<br />
<br />
Alex then filled out the rest of the profile. Pondering how to do so. He remembered the heated, passionate night with Chad. And also how his own desires seemed to have undergone something of an evolution. An evolution he truly didn&#39;t understand all that well, but an evolution. He wrote down; &#39;60 year old teacher and fitness fanatic looking for fun and passionate hook-ups with the potential for a longer term relationship if all things go well.&#39;<br />
<br />
As Alex started to head out, deciding to get ready for his fourth period class - he had history to teach yet again, along with a class full of jocks who seemed none the least bit interested in the factors leading up to World War I - he felt a buzz in his pocket. Hm. Couldn&#39;t be.<br />
<br />
He checked his phone as he left the area of the teacher&#39;s lounge, seeing the principal himself heading there...and looking a bit more built than usual. How far did this go...? Well, for right now, Alex focused on what was going on. He checked his phone - so soon after making his profile? - and looked on there. Seeing a young woman from town named Darlene White, about 24, and with light auburn hair, blue eyes, and slightly pale skin. She seemed to have some academic interests more than sporting ones, but she was thin and very attractive.<br />
<br />
Plus, she liked history and had a sense of humor, going by what he saw of her profile. He saw no reason to turn her down.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey, I see you liked my profile pics&#39;. Alex started. &#39;Would you be up for a date?&#39;<br />
<br />
Alex gulped and wondered how he might handle this. She was 24! 24! What if she thought he was, in person, a fuddy duddy who wasn&#39;t nearly as exciting as his apparent fitness made him out to be? What if he didn&#39;t know what she was talking about? Alex wiped his forehead and hoped that she wouldn&#39;t laugh him off if this really did---<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ve actually been pretty lonely lately,&#39; Darlene responded, &#39;I&#39;d be up for a date. Boyfriend was not the best. And I need to get back into this.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Thank you. I&#39;ve been more or less lonely myself.&#39; Alex responded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Really? Big buff older man like you, lonely? I figure you&#39;d be pretty popular.&#39; She said, &#39;Can we meet up at whatever gym you go to? I&#39;ve been meaning to try and get into that lately.&#39;<br />
<br />
Alex thought about her and potentially having Chad around for that, and the idea was both incredibly complicated in terms of what in all it would entail, and something that enticed him. He knew it might not be the wisest idea. But damn if it wasn&#39;t making him feel more excited for a date than he&#39;d been in the last years.<br />
<br />
&#39;Your profile says you have experience with men, Alex.&#39; Darlene asked on the app, and Alex froze. He wondered if that was a dealbreaker, or if she was of a rather traditionalistic mindset. He breathed when she continued, &#39;I&#39;m interested in men open about their interest in other men. How far does your experience go?&#39;<br />
<br />
Ah, so it seemed she was interested in the idea of a potential menage. Well, that was...not nearly as bad as he feared for that brief moment. &#39;I received a blowjob from my trainer once. Other than that, my experiences with my own gender are limited. I&#39;m not entirely sure what my sexuality is with this in mind.&#39;<br />
<br />
Darlene responded, &#39;Well, it&#39;s whatever you want it to be.&#39; And again he got that answer. Alex supposed it might just be his old fashioned nature showing a bit. He shook his head. Well then, he decided, whatever he wanted it to be would be good. He was definitely down to date - and sleep with - Darlene, but he couldn&#39;t deny his own attraction to Chad and other muscular, well formed men. Maybe, he decided, I&#39;m a bit complicated.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll see you when we have our date. Would this Wednesday be good?&#39; Alex asked. Darlene responded with a thumbs up emoji, and Alex went on to start prepping for class. But with a definite smile on his face and feeling better about himself than he had in some time.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, Oh yes Kendall that&#39;s so good...&quot; Allison moaned as Kendall thrust away into her pussy, enjoying the strength and powerful build it seemed whatever was going on decided to gift him with. Usually by now or so he&#39;d be rather exhausted and need her to do more of the work milking an orgasm out of him, but today he seemed so...strong. She did feel something seemed a little different than even prior about him. Maybe it was the sweat from their sexual congress or something. But she could tell something was up. But she also knew she wanted him now, and hopefully she could try and talk him into noticing what was going on afterwards.<br />
<br />
Kendall himself just kept engaging with their sexual act, trying not to pay much heed to what he could see by now was going on. His pecs and shoulders, as well as arms, looked a bit thicker than usual, stronger built but less toned. His back wider and stronger. But the abs Kendall had grown to greatly love and appreciate seemed to have mostly vanished from him - he was growing stronger right now, but he was bulking up in a way that wasn&#39;t very clean.<br />
<br />
If Kendall flexed as hard as he could flex, he might see four abs, but it seemed his current build was more trending toward bulky but strong. Though it was not costing him any sexual endurance, which he appreciated. Plus he retained his prodigious gift. &quot;Ahh...Allison...fuck you&#39;re voracious. Oh, oh! It appears...I have discovered the antidote to my flagging verbosity lately. It appears my...mental acuity...fuuuck...is tied to my...sexual performance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Translation, big guy?&quot; Allison moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears erotic satisfaction is linked in some way to mental capacity.&quot; It was admittedly correlation, and everyone knew about what correlation did not imply about causation, but Kendall took it as a &quot;win&quot; right then and there. But he was still pretty worried about how Allison might take his bulkier body. Offhandedly, Kendall reached up curiously and tweaked a nipple between his forefinger and thumb.<br />
<br />
He gasped and thrust a few more times faster than usual, astonished by the sensitivity and erotic sense from it. &quot;Ohh babe...you&#39;re...you&#39;re going to make me cum at this rate! O-Orgasm...im-imminent! I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot; Kendall thankfully got out in time and released his emission on Allison&#39;s back and butt, and she breathed, turning around and looking at Kendall...and gasping a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is...admittedly the fastest I&#39;ve seen anything like this happen around here.&quot; Allison reached over, and, still heated up from their sexual encounter, lightly touched Kendall&#39;s pectoral at the nipple - and despite herself giggled when Kendall gasped and his cock gave an interested jerk upon the contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know this is all rather alarming, and I&#39;ve noticed this about myself over the day...but I&#39;ll admit, I feel pretty good so far. Even with this bulk up in mind.&quot; Kendall shrugged and said, &quot;I&#39;m still me. I&#39;m still fucking you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...but we have to be careful. Just in case...&quot; Allison sighed, laying back. &quot;Just...let me know if anything happens more than this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, certainly, babe.&quot; Kendall responded, though he didn&#39;t really take it all very seriously. He was honestly feeling pretty curious in seeing how his body developed from here. Hopefully it wouldn&#39;t keep bulking up like this. He liked having abs. &quot;Now, I believe you and I have 2 or 3 more occasions to enjoy before third period ends. I&#39;m...feeling a little sore but all around satisfied. May I ask for a blowjob next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, big boy.&quot; Allison guided him back on to his chair, letting Kendall recline and relax while she took her spot between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And...and...er.&quot; Kendall started, looking down at her, &quot;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, tweak my nipples every now and then. It er...it feels quite incredible.&quot; <br />
<br />
Allison nodded, hoping she could help Kendall retain himself as he went through whatever transformation he was going through. Maybe he was turning into some kind of jock? It was an early guess, admittedly, but she was so far feeling like that was the potential change path with the most evidence in its favor. But there was something odd about it in general. Something that just seemed unusual by comparison. Maybe it was how Kendall looked, or the way his body got so hairy up to a certain point and now looked like he waxed every week.<br />
<br />
It was silly, she knew.<br />
<br />
First she complained about how hairy he was getting, and then she felt off about how smooth his skin was. Well, they had a few more times to go, best not waste any time. Allison promptly went ahead and started taking Kendall&#39;s manhood into her mouth. He was obviously enthusiastic about this, moaning and gasping lightly, but then grunting and twitching a bit when she reached up and tweaked a nipple. As much as she knew she had to be aware, Bulky Kendall was...honestly, kind of fun.</p>
