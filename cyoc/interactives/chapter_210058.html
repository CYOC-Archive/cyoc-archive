<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James stood on the side of the road, looking towards Ellie’s house, frequently checking his watch, aware of the time.<br />
Just a moment before he was going to text her, he saw her quickly open her front gate and run towards him,<br />
“Sorry!” She called, “I just…” she looked completely out of breath as she got closer to him. She stopped beside him, placing her hand on her knees to catch her breath, “…I just couldn’t find anything that fit me. It’s all too small,” she said, letting out a long sigh before she pulled herself together. As she stood back upright, James could see that her casual sweater was exposing a lot of her pudgy midriff. The two began walking,<br />
“It’s alright,” James said. He reached into his pocket, revealing a fair sized candy bar and handing it to his best friend, “thought you might want this,” he said, smirking. Ellie didn’t notice, she was too entranced by the candy bar to take any note, snatching it out of his hand,<br />
“Thanks!” She said, tearing open the packaging and immediately taking a bite down on it, “I’m just so hungry right now, it started last night…” she said, stopping for a moment.<br />
The two made eye contact, almost as if someone was going to realise a wish had been made to mess with them!<br />
<br />
“Anyways,” Ellie started, clueless to the obvious truth, “I actually connected with my sister last night!” She said with glee, taking several more bites out of the candy bar,<br />
“Really?” James asked, looking at his best friend is genuine surprise,<br />
“Yeah!” Ellie said, “to be totally honest, I did make several wishes to make her super ugly and gross and stuff,”<br />
“That’s… not great,” James said awkwardly,<br />
“No no! She stopped being such a stupid stuck up bitch because she was ugly! But she continued to be happy, like her life continued as it had been but everything happened for different reasons, like her boyfriend loved her for her, not just her looks!” She said, almost looking a little salty as she finished, biting down aggressively on her candy bar, finishing it off, “so I spoke to her, and it was like I was actually speaking to my sister!” She said with delight,<br />
“That’s… good?” James said, “you connected with your sister, but you had to make her an ugly monster to do it?”<br />
“Well she wasn’t a monster…” Ellie said grumpily, “plus she deserved it…” she grumbled, “but I wished her back to normal, just with the new outlook I’d given her,”<br />
“Oh… so you made her a better person?”<br />
“Exactly!” Ellie said, “and I feel like I did a damn good thing!” She finished with a proud look upon her face,<br />
“I’m actually really surprised you didn’t just leave her like that…” James said, “well done on learning a good lesson I guess!”<br />
“Thanks, bro!” She said, punching him in the arm, making him wince, “god you really are a wimp…”<br />
“The moment I think you’re a nicer person,” James said, sighing, “here,” he said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out two more candy bars, each bigger than the last one. Ellie’s eyes lit up,<br />
“YES!” She said, snatching them out of his hand. She tore them open and started munching down on them. She looked at James, then down, then back up, “how’s that bubble butt?”<br />
“Big,” James replied bluntly, “and jiggly,” he admitted. Ellie couldn’t help but burst out laughing. James also let out a slight chuckle, knowing he is well on his way to get his revenge,<br />
“You still can’t get rid of it until I say so!” Ellie said,<br />
“I know,” he agreed, “I promise I haven’t wished it away since you gave it to me,<br />
“Good,” Ellie said, chewing down on the last few pieces of her candy bars, “whew…” Ellie said.<br />
<br />
A moment of silence was shared between the two as they walked along their familiar path to High-School.<br />
James broke the silence, “so who’s wish is it?” He asked,<br />
“I’m not sure,” Ellie said, “I wish my clothes actually fit me,” she said. Nothing happened. She looked back at James, “I guess it’s yours,”<br />
“Good,” James said. He cleared his throat, “we need to make some rules for school today,” he started,<br />
“I agree,” Ellie said,<br />
“So we should say, no wishes that can make us do anything we don’t want to do,”<br />
“Good one,” Ellie said, “like wishing someone would have sex with one of us,”<br />
“That’s basic human rights… so yeah. Obviously,” James said. He hesitated, wondering if Ellie would agree with his next suggestion, “how about we say… no boundaries to whatever we wish for each other, as long as it doesn’t affect our grades or anything,”<br />
“N-no boundaries?” Ellie said, puzzled, “like wish whatever we want on each other?”<br />
“Yeah…” James said awkwardly, “like… whatever we wish on each other, we can’t get mad at each other for it. Like if it’s something embarrassing we can’t take it personally,”<br />
“Uhm…” Ellie said, “I guess. But if we hate it we can wish it away, right?”<br />
“Yeah sure,” James said, “but if you wish it away, then I would get another free wish,”<br />
“Y’know what,” Ellie said, “sure!” She agreed, a smirk appearing on her face, “I’m gonna mess with you a lot though,”<br />
“Oh you have no idea what I’m gonna do to you,” James said, a smirk on his face as well,<br />
“Agree that our competition begins once our first class begins, I need to say hi to Jenny first, unchanged,” she stated,<br />
“Sounds good,” James said,<br />
“What about changing other people?” Ellie asked. James thought for a moment,<br />
“I mean… it seems like you can change anyone and they won’t notice unless you wish for them to notice, so I guess changing others isn’t so bad. But let’s agree to change them back after school ends,”<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Ellie agreed, “and final question,”<br />
“Mhm,” James said, listening,<br />
“Changing ourselves?”<br />
“Yeah you can do whatever,” James agreed, “but main priority is messing with each other. That’s the fun today!”<br />
“Great!” Ellie said, “and right on time,” she said, pointing forwards at the High-School that had appeared in front of them.<br />
<br />
The two walked into the main entrance of the school, seeing all the students getting off of the bus and walking in from all different directions. Even seeing teachers getting out of their cars and quietly making their way inside. Ellie and James, although silently walking together, both knew that today was going to be a chaotic day.</p>
