<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tanya ran outside the building, her clothes began to pinch her body uncomfortably.  But her body felt so good, and she was making such good time, she didn&#39;t really care.  She had so much energy, she thought she was really going to tear it up at volleyball practice today.<br />
<br />
As she ran, she continued to get the odd feeling that everything was too small.  Everybody she ran past seemed shorter than her,  including the guys. A few of them gave her strange looks, as if she was the odd one.  Even inanimate objects like cars and street signs seemed shorter than she remembered.  She was beginning to get a little worried that her head injury may have been more serious than she thought.  Maybe running into the doorframe had given her a concussion.<br />
<br />
The sight of her friends at the volleyball court cheered her up.  Maybe a few rounds of practice would set her straight.  But even her friends seemed small in the distance.  And as she got closer, they still looked short.  <br />
<br />
Are they stretching or something, thought Tanya.  Maybe playing on their knees.<br />
<br />
She reached the court, and noticed that they had lowered the net for some reason.  Her upper body was higher than the top of the net, and she could easily spike the ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys.  Sorry I&#39;m late, but we can start practice now.  You probably should raise the net.  It will be too easy, &quot; said Tanya.<br />
<br />
The girls turned and looked at her with shock.  Finally, one of them broke the silence and spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell are you? &quot; asked Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon, guys, don&#39;t give me a hard time.  I&#39;ve had a rough day.  Let&#39;s just start practice, &quot; said Tanya.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d love to have a girl like you on the team, but I have no idea who you are.  What&#39;s your name?&quot; asked Jill, eyeing her up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, Tanya, &quot; said Tanya.<br />
<br />
The girls laughed.  &quot;Tanya? Yeah right.  I&#39;ll admit you look like her.  But Tanya is only 5&#39;9&quot;, and you have to be over 7 feet tall.  Are you her cousin or something?&quot; said Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit playing around, &quot; said Tanya, as she reached down to grab the volleyball.  It looked small in her hands.  As she slowly stood up, she saw that her friends had not been kneeling.  She towered over them at their standing height, even taller than their star player Jill, who has 6&#39;5&quot;.  Everything made sense now.  Somehow, she had grown ridiculously tall.  Embarrassed, she began to back away. &quot;Sorry, I have made a terrible mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, where are you going?  If you have any skills, we could use a player with your height, &quot; said Jill.  Although initially shocked, Jill liked the look of this girl.  She was tall, but had an attractive lean athletic build. It wasn&#39;t often that Jill met girls that were taller than her, and she liked being the small girl for a change. She kind of hoped the girl would stick around, so she could get to know her better.  With any luck, they might become friends.  With a lot of luck, they might become more than friends.  But the girl ignored her, and ran away.<br />
<br />
As she ran back to her apartment, Tanya silently cursed.  She knew who was responsible for her predicament.  It was the only other person who hadn&#39;t seemed to change size - Cindy.  Cindy was always up to something, playing little practical jokes.  Well, she had gone too far this time. When Tanya got home, she was going to make her pay.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Back at the apartment, Cindy was having problems of her own.<br />
<br />
Dammit, why did I have to leave that perfume in the bathroom, thought Cindy.  She already felt weird being over seven feet tall.  She certainly didn&#39;t want to get any taller.  Bu if she wanted to continue to deceive Tanya, she would need to spray herself again.  She picked up the bottle, pondering her options.<br />
<br />
Screw it, thought Cindy.  She will figure it out for herself at practice anyway.  I don&#39;t need to get any taller. <br />
<br />
She was about to place the perfume back in the box with the others, when she was overwhelmed with a strange sensation.  Her stomach cramped, causing her to drop the perfume to the floor, spilling some on the carpet.  As she gripped her stomach, it began to feel warm, spreading heat throughout her body.  As the heat reached her fingers and toes, her body began to rapidly grow and stretch.  In just a few seconds, she was another 6 inches taller.  Her clothes remained intact, but clung tightly to her body.  The large sweatshirt now looked like a sports bra, and her long skirt now resembled a cheerleader skirt, barely covering her privates.<br />
<br />
What is going on? thought Cindy with fear.  First Tanya, now me.  Why did we grow without using the perfume?  This is getting dangerous.  I need to reverse this now.<br />
<br />
Cindy began to search through the vials for the shrink potion.  Suddenly, the door flew open.  Tanya stood in the doorway, her clothes in tatters hanging loosely from her body.  Evidently she done some additional growing, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindy, what the hell have you done to me? &quot; said Tanya angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya, please let me explain.  I can fix everything if you give me a chance, &quot; pleaded Cindy.<br />
<br />
Tanya walked up to Cindy, just a few inches from her face.  They were now about the same height, but Tanya&#39;s athletic and toned body gave her an advantage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Cindy, explain, &quot; said Tanya.  &quot;But this better be good.&quot;</p>
