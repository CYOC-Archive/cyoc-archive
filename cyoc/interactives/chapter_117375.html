<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Helen looked at her computer screen again, she tried to quit her moaning and ignore her arousal, as she&#39;d found an instruction manual at the &quot;help&quot; tab. The manual existed of an important notice, hints and tips and different chapters on how to use the Chronivac in its advanced settings. All things she&#39;d changed were still superficial, apparently. The changes on Helen&#39;s new body were nothing like other things she could change in detail.<br />
<br />
One thing that was brought to attention was that even the manual was infinite. It gave information about anything she could change into, giving her a small description and if needed an explanation. All she had to do was fill in a keyword on the search engine, and after loading a couple of seconds, a chapter would already appear. Of course, if she were to fill in gibberish or a lengthy question, just like Google it probably wouldn&#39;t find anything, or it would just link her to something completely different.<br />
<br />
The manual explained things like how the &quot;alter reality&quot; option worked, and how Helen could create a whole family tree, or didn&#39;t even need to as it didn&#39;t have consequences. It also explained that if her age wasn&#39;t set, it would be based on either a previously used 3D-model or on how the body looked compared to those of other people on Earth. If Helen were to fill in &quot;2 species&quot; in the search engine -she remembered it from before, when she was given the possibility to change her bottom half with that of a snake&#39;s- it would give her a whole description of how it worked, even in a scientifically &quot;accurate&quot; way. She didn&#39;t really believe how it would be scientifically accurate, but in the end; the Chronivac could change anything, possibly physics and science included.<br />
<br />
Helen searched for an explanation to the 2 different settings, &quot;related&quot; and &quot;unrelated&quot;. Helen already stated before that altering reality meant it didn&#39;t do anything with her physical body, but with everything around her. When it finally showed an explanation this is what she read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Related settings are those that change the model&#39;s physical appearance. It can change the model&#39;s looks, for what rests nothing else. For example, on the related settings you can change an arm into a leg. Related settings are always reversible. For an overwritten file it is possible as well, but it requires a lot of work for the creator of the changed model, as he would have to reverse the overwritten process step by step. The log file is something that can be used very well. However, as every single detail is saved in the log file, every detail has to be changed back in the same order as before, or it might cause slight mistakes to the model&#39;s appearance. Physical changes are never permanent. On this given note, it is still possible that the creator is at some point unable to use the Chronivac, meaning he/she/it would need the help of someone else to undo previous changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The explanation went on after that, but this was the most important part as Helen read through it. She bit her nails, giving a worried look again. If she wanted to turn back into who she was all her life, apparently Matt Helen, she&#39;d have to reverse the whole proces which were saved step by step in her log files. The big problem however was the details. Every freckle shown on her current body was saved in the log files, and it would mean that every freckle had to be undone again. Ignoring her worries, she went on reading the article about unrelated settings:<br />
<br />
&quot;Unrelated settings are those that don&#39;t change the model&#39;s appearance. The unrelated settings change everything that revolves around the model. If a model is worn by its creator, or someone else, it means the body is the model, and everything else is unrelated. Important examples of unrelated changes are altering reality and changing minds. I all cases altering reality means changing mindsets of people, but it depends on how you use it. If a creator alters reality, nothing happens WITH the model, but things happen AROUND the model. This is because the model is already changed, and the creator is given the choice whether he wants to change things so it will be easier for the creator to live life when wearing a model. Examples: clothes changing and thinking things were used to be like what they are when the creator wears a changed model.&quot; This explains Helen&#39;s changed thoughts about her name. She didn&#39;t remember having ever been called Matt as first name, but this was caused by the option to alter reality, and she chose it specifically for herself. &quot;Altering reality can change specific items, the creator can select those. If the creator wants to alter reality completely, he/she/it can use the -SELECT ALL- option.&quot; And that explained the fact nothing changed except for her name. If she were to have clicked on that button, her clothes would have changed into those of a woman&#39;s, here room would have changed into that of a woman&#39;s, and people who knew her did so in a way as if she&#39;d always been a woman.<br />
<br />
The thought of having woman&#39;s clothes on didn&#39;t feel comfortable to Helen. But if she ever wanted to have it like that, she could just select the &quot;clothes&quot; section of everything she owned, and alter reality so it would fit her more. She could also choose specific clothes. If it were really necessary, she could also just alter her current reality completely, changing her apartment, and giving people who&#39;d known her since she was little the mindset of her having always been female. Still, she didn&#39;t have to worry about that. She wasn&#39;t exactly related to anyone right now.<br />
<br />
It was refreshing to know about all this, and reassured Helen nothing could go wrong if she just put her attention on the Chronivac when saving her stuff. She looked at her body and felt like she needed something new again. It was about time for a change...</p>
