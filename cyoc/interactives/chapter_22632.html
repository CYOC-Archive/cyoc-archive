<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was one of the lucky winners of a contest which was held during a popular morning talk show, which was held on the radio every morning. Ty was the lucky thirteenth caller to the “Kidd Kraddick in the Morning” radio show, and he won ten round-trip tickets from Orlando, Florida, to Venice Beach, California. He was able to use these tickets during Spring Break, which was the following week.<br />
<br />
Naturally, Ty decided to invite all his friends to come with him. He invited Dustin, Joce, Allen, Tim, Jason, Kent, Milton, Peter, Noah, Oliver, and Conchita. Since they were 12 altogether, Ty and Allen had decided to use their powers to just simply teleport Kent and Peter, who had gotten used to being teleported from place to place by Ty, Allen and Joce. That way, they were still able to go to California with the whole group.<br />
<br />
As soon as the gang had arrived at the hotel, which was on the beach, Joce used her power to teleport Peter. As soon as she snapped her fingers, Peter popped up before her, with his towel around his neck, and dressed with his Speedo. Ty did the same to Kent, and he teleported the timid boy, who was scared to death of flying in an airplane, anyway. Ty didn’t want to leave Kent behind, so he decided to teleport Kent as soon as they arrived at the airport.<br />
<br />
Oliver was a foreign exchange student, who had originally come from Germany. He had immediately become great friends with Ty, Dustin, Allen and Peter, and he quickly found out about these mysterious powers, which Ty, Joce and Allen possessed. Ty and Allen demonstrated, by making Kent and Peter grow taller, and the rest of the group learned about their awesome abilities. Of course, Allen and Joce were only able to change Peter, while Ty had the ability to change just about everybody else.<br />
<br />
Ty, Milton, Conchita and Joce had gone swimming, while the others were just lying on the sandy beach, just a few yards away from the ocean. Kent had become thirsty, so he went over to the small sea-side snack bar, in order to get a drink. <br />
<br />
While Kent was standing in line, waiting to be helped by the lady behind the counter, another man walked up and slipped right before him in the line. The man was tall and muscular, and he had a mustache and a beard. He had his long hair tied together as a ponytail, and he sneered at the lady behind the counter, ordering her to hurry up and help him quickly.<br />
<br />
“Give me a beer, will you?” the man growled at the lady, who was standing behind the counter.<br />
<br />
“Uhh…. Excuse me…” Kent said softly.<br />
<br />
“Whaddayawant?” the big, husky man growled back.<br />
<br />
“I was standing in line when you cut in front of me…” Kent said to him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah?” the man said in a threatening voice. “What, exactly, are you planning to do about that?”<br />
<br />
“Leave him alone, Doug!” the lady ordered him, as she pointed to where Ty and the others were laying in the sand on the beach. “This dude came with that large group of people over there. You can tell that they’re from out-of-town…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, really? Well, I guess I need to show them who I am…” the big man sneered back.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me…” Kent said to him, once again.<br />
<br />
Doug had just gotten his beer in a cup. He totally ignored Kent, as he turned around and started to walk away.<br />
<br />
“Cutting in front of other people, while they’re standing in line, is considered very rude!” Kent said out loud.<br />
<br />
Just when he had said that, the large, muscular man, slowly turned around to face him.<br />
<br />
“Just where are you from, punk?” he said to him.<br />
<br />
“I’m from Florida.”<br />
<br />
“Well… Here in California, it’s considered normal to cut in front of tourists from Florida. Now, beat it and leave me alone, before I take care of your sorry, little group over there…”<br />
<br />
“Leave them alone, Doug…” the lady added. “Don’t scare away these tourists…”<br />
<br />
Doug turned around and walked away, while he continued to drink the beer from his plastic cup. Kent was finally able to turn to face the lady behind the counter, so that he could order his cup of soda.<br />
<br />
Moments later, Kent sat down on his towel. He was sitting next to Peter, who was lying on his back, while he was on top of his towel. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Doug walked up to where Kent was sitting, and he kicked a cloud of sand in his face.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What gives?” Kent shouted at him.<br />
<br />
Ty, Joce and Allen were just walking out of the water, when they noticed how Doug was busy giving Kent and Peter a hard time.<br />
<br />
“Guys…” Ty said, as he pointed to his friends. “There’s something going on with Peter and Kent…”<br />
<br />
Peter had gotten up, and he walked up to Doug with an angry look on his face.<br />
<br />
Doug was about six foot six inches tall, and he towered over Peter with a few inches. Not only that, but he was considerably more muscular than Peter as well!<br />
<br />
“Say, what’s the big idea, of kicking sand in our faces? Are you nuts?” Peter said to Doug in an angry tone of voice.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! First you cut in line, now you do this! You people from California are rude!” Kent shouted at him.<br />
<br />
“Me? I’m rude?” Doug laughed sarcastically. “Wait; let me show you something…”<br />
<br />
Doug placed both hands on Peter’s chest, and then he gave him a hard shove, forcing him to fall on the ground just a few feet away from where Doug was standing.<br />
<br />
“You pitiful weaklings…” Doug sneered at Peter. Then, he turned to face Kent.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Ty and Joce were watching what was going on. They saw how Doug had pushed Peter to the ground, before turning to face Kent.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! The big lug is going to beat up on Kent!” Joce exclaimed. “Ty! Do something!”<br />
<br />
Ty stared at Kent and concentrated intensely.<br />
<br />
As Doug slowly started walking towards Kent, the smaller boy slowly stepped back. Kent was filled with fear, as he was now standing face-to-face with a big, muscular man. The muscle man already had one bad incident with him, and things were now looking ugly for the short, timid high school student.<br />
<br />
“Listen… can we talk? I’m a bit sensitive to pain… You know what I mean?” Kent stuttered to the approaching muscle man.<br />
<br />
Doug was only wearing a Speedo, and his large, muscular chest was certainly very intimidating for the shorter, spectacled and geeky student.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to put your sensitivity to the test, right now…” Doug growled softly, as he made a fist and prepared to punch the boy in the face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kent had frozen at the place where he was standing, following by a strange, tingling sensation, which started to grow from inside of his torso.<br />
<br />
The 5 foot 6 inch tall kid suddenly began to grow taller! His legs began to grow, slowly pushing Kent’s torso up higher. Kent gasped out loud, as he felt his body grow. He realized that he was almost as tall as Doug, now!<br />
<br />
“Hey… What’s going on?” Doug wondered.<br />
<br />
Kent was now 5 foot 7… 5 foot 8… 5 foot 9…<br />
<br />
Kent’s unexpected growth spurt caused Doug to freeze in place, as he witnessed the boy while he rapidly grew taller!<br />
<br />
The boy was 5 foot 10… 5 foot 11… 6 feet…<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Kent exclaimed, as he watched the ground get further and further away from his sight, when he looked down. When he raised his head up and looked at Doug, he noticed that he was about to pass the big muscle man in height.<br />
<br />
He was now 6 foot 1… 6 foot 2… 6 foot 3… 6 foot 4…<br />
<br />
Doug took a step back, as his mouth dropped wide open, while he witnessed Kent’s strange growth spurt.<br />
<br />
“What… Who… Who are you? How is it possible that a kid like you grow like that? What…” he stuttered, as he stared at the boy in disbelief?<br />
<br />
6 foot 5… 6 foot 6…<br />
<br />
Kent was now 6 foot and 6 inches tall, dwarfing Doug by a few inches now.<br />
<br />
“Wow…” Kent whispered out of amazement.<br />
<br />
Then, the strange tingling feeling spread through the rest of his body, and it affected his muscles, in particular!<br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” Doug exclaimed, as he witnessed the strangest change of all.<br />
<br />
Kent’s body rapidly began to bulk up! His legs grew thicker, as they expanded by almost 6 inches! Layers of muscles added on to his quads, while his calves began to tingle at first. They then began to vibrate, before they magically inflated like balloons which were being filled with air.<br />
<br />
Next, his body widened by almost a foot, as his chest began to grow farther and farther out front of him. Large pectorals began to form and grow; pushing his shoulders out sideways, while magnificent lats began to spread below his armpits.<br />
<br />
“Who… WHAT ARE YOU?” Doug shouted. The poor man was in shock! He had no idea, how to explain the strange transformation, which he had just witnessed.<br />
<br />
Kent’s arms suddenly grew into large, long, and thick pythons of strength and muscle, as triceps, biceps, and traps bulged out of him, like muscles which had suddenly gained lives of their own.<br />
<br />
“I must be seeing things… This isn’t normal…” Doug pondered, as he slowly took a few steps back. He was now scared to death of the boy, who had now grown to be bigger and taller than him. Not only that, but Kent was becoming far more muscular than Doug!<br />
<br />
Kent just stared at his arms and the rest of his body, while his abdominals continued to cover his torso, like a tiled bathroom wall. His arms were so big, that they were now hanging from his shoulders at a forty-five degree angle.<br />
<br />
Finally, his pectorals shot out almost a foot in front of him, and a foot to either side, making Kent seem very wide! Kent had now become a huge muscle man!<br />
<br />
“I… I… I’m getting out of here…” Doug shouted, as he continued to back away in real fear of the hulked-out teenager. “Get… Go… GO AWAY FROM ME! WHRAAAAAAAAHHH!!!”<br />
<br />
Doug turned around and ran away from Kent as fast as his legs could carry him!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ty and Joce burst out in laughter, while Kent was standing at the same place, wondering what had happened to him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Kent…” Ty shouted to towering muscle teen. “I had to grow you big so that we could teach Doug a lesson…”<br />
<br />
Peter had gotten up and he slowly approached Kent as well.<br />
<br />
“Hey, dude! You’re the biggest guy on Venice beach!” Peter chuckled.<br />
<br />
Ty, Joce and Peter then stared at the hulking Kent in amazement. This was only their first day in California, and they realized that there would be several more opportunities to make each other grow.<br />
<br />
“Remember, this is Venice beach…” Ty explained to them. “I guess we’ll have to make some changes, before these people decide to accept us!”<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Ty… Do I have to stay this big?” Kent asked him. “Being this tall kinda makes me dizzy every time I look down…”<br />
<br />
Ty, Joce and Peter burst out in laughter at the same time…</p>
