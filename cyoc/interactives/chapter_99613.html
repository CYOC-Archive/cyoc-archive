<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate and Alex found the house quiet as they entered through the Ramsey&#39;s back door... well, nearly quiet. Things had been put away, but both Nate and Alex heard a low thumping and corresponding moans coming from one of the bedrooms. Out where they were it was rather soft, but it was loud enough that their ears could pick things up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose your parents will have no problem with us finishing our homework,&quot; Nate commented.<br />
<br />
Alex gave a small chuckle, &quot;Yeah... they sound rather busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that will let us finish our math homework,&quot; Nate nodded.<br />
<br />
The two of them quietly made their way to the kitchen and set their bags down on the floor. They also tried to keep things down so as not to disturb Alex&#39;s parents. The two of them soon had their books set on the table and the papers laid next to them. The two of them had made some progress on it before they left the library, and Nate was actually closer to the end of the assignment then Alex was. Much of this related the trouble Alex had with the mathematical aspects of Chemistry assignment that they had worked on in the library. The only difference was that Algebra had unknowns that weren&#39;t only in the end answer as was the case with the problems to with regard to Chemistry&#39;s questions on how much was needed or used in a specific reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... handsome...&quot; Nate said softly, &quot;You&#39;re never going to get the right answer that way. You want to split it into two separate equations... like this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate then leaned over write next to what Alex had written. Alex looked over Nate&#39;s shoulder as Nate wrote on the paper: (X + 2)(X + 2) =100. Alex had some question as to whether or not that would work. Nate began to slowly explain his work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember we want to find the value of X, right?&quot; Nate spoke.<br />
<br />
Alex nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... based on how we have it, we have two problems that when multiplied by each other they&#39;d equal one hundred,&quot; Nate explained, &quot;which would mean that X plus two has to equal the square root of one hundred.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex watched as Nate then wrote out the work carry out the problem to carry out the work. It was at this point that Alex began to get an idea on how to get the answer, as it now came down more simple multiplication and division. He knew that ten times ten equaled one hundred, which would mean that each half of the problem equaled ten and then opened the door for basic addition and subtraction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Alex said slowly, &quot;that would then mean that X in this problem would have to be eight, right? Eight plus two is ten, and ten times ten is one hundred.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded as Alex finished writing out the answer for the problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;And many of the problems can be worked out that way,&quot; Nate told him, &quot;it&#39;s the way I&#39;ve always worked on these sorts of problems...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who taught you that?&quot; Alex answered as the two of them then started on the next problem, &quot;as I don&#39;t remember the teacher going through that way of working it out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate thought the teacher had made some mention of that as a means of solving these problems, but he couldn&#39;t fully remember if that was the way the teacher had explained. He gave a brief shrug as there were people who had helped him with these sorts of problems before. His middle school and earlier high school math classes in Minnesota had given some introductions to these sorts of problems before and he had worked through them before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I&#39;d gotten help in my past from my folks,&quot; Nate said quietly, &quot;this is how they solved these sorts of problems...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoulda known,&quot; Alex shook his head, &quot;a teacher&#39;s kid...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate gave a playful punch. It did no harm to Alex and left Alex chuckling slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember that my dad&#39;s specialty is in English and specifically with English literature and my mom was an elementary school teacher,&quot; Nate chided, &quot;they don&#39;t work with these sorts of problems on a day to day basis. It&#39;s something that anyone can figure out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve figured out we aren&#39;t going to be using this when we grow up,&quot; Alex answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; Nate gave a sarcastic laugh.<br />
<br />
The two of them worked through the rest of the problems and did fairly well with getting the problems done. As he finished, Nate placed the notebook paper that he&#39;d been writing his answers and problems on in the book between the pages that held the problems they&#39;d been working on. He then slammed the book shut and stretched backward. Alex did the same shortly afterward and the two looked to each other and gave a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the help with the math problems,&quot; Alex gave a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Nate smiled back, &quot;It&#39;s good to get everything done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both male werewolves let their minds drift for a moment to other ideas, particularly as a pair of howls could now be heard coming from Alex&#39;s parents&#39; room. The two married werewolves were still &quot;busy&quot; and had even transformed. It gave both of them the idea to &quot;join in&quot; and have their own fun, and Nate felt a certain stirring in his pants. However, a chime coming from one of the other rooms soon spoiled any idea of going further for the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Nate gave a low curse at that, &quot;I need to get going home... it&#39;s still a school night and my parents will want me to follow a curfew...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... they&#39;re parents,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;that&#39;s their job. Besides, tomorrow is Wednesday. We get through that and then the week is half over. Friday... we can go out on a real romp... Camp out in an area that Moon Lake&#39;s set aside for weres and have lots of fun. Your folks will be okay with that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;though... my dad has his formal welcome to the Skulk on Friday. My mom, brother, and I will probably go to be supportive and that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex gave a low &quot;hmm&quot; and then commented, &quot;well... the werefoxes... and a few other were-beasts... tend to give honorary membership to mates if they aren&#39;t of the same were-species. So, while your mom is a werecat, because she&#39;s your father&#39;s bonded mate, she would be considered part of the Skulk as well. It&#39;d be the same if you were still a werewolf and I was a werefox. As we bond... you would be welcomed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Nate mused, &quot;Interesting... though the handbook has said that werefoxes tend to be strictly heterosexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh the do,&quot; Alex chuckled, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean that every werefox is... It&#39;s rarer for one to find a homosexual werefox, but I think there have been at least one or two in Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, &quot;I see... well... still, we couldn&#39;t meet or do anything until after my dad&#39;s formal welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can pick you up after if it&#39;s okay with your folks,&quot; Alex offered.<br />
<br />
The two got up and Nate began packing his books and papers back into his backpack. He also thought over Alex&#39;s proposal. He figured that could work, though he&#39;d still need to get permission from his folks and figure out where his father&#39;s formal welcome would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d work,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;I&#39;ll get permission and the address and let you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them then slowly made their way back toward the back door. They reached it and Alex opened it for Nate. Nate smiled as he stood in front of Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good... you have my phone number?&quot; Alex answered.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, &quot;Yep. Though... for now... I need to get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two shared a brief kiss, but soon after they broke apart and Alex headed back into his home. Nate was then jogging back through the woods toward his own home.</p>
