<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Nazaric thought about it more he sighed as he walked back off towards his throne room. He figured that it’d be inconsiderate to take action against Tyria&#39;s foster family now, despite what they’ve done to her in her mortal life. He had much more important matters to attend to as well, who would inform his servants on his monumental accomplishment after all?<br />
<br />
First he snapped his fingers and assumed his quadrupedal form and then again to seal the bedroom doors shut to prevent any intruders or sounds from accessing his newfound bride. He then hopped up onto his throne and let out a bellowing roar that filled not only the room, but many more within his temple of draconic pride, and he watched as five of his most loyal servants entered his chamber.<br />
<br />
First was Tharix, a red scaled dragon who ruled valiantly over an entire empire of draconic civilizations, however since the dawn of man he stayed hidden and ordered many of his followers underground where it was safe. He is one of Nazaric&#39;s finest soldiers who’s battle scars range from a lost right eye, gouged out during a fierce war, to a large wound across his chest where not even scales grew to this day. Nazaric grated him immortality, and a place on his most honorable servants for his pride in battle and his courage. He constantly is told to take a rest from his military duties sometimes, but to this day still serves as a knight for his ruler as a symbol of strength. &quot;Our lord, it is an honor, but why have you called me away from my people?&quot; He asked curiously.<br />
<br />
Then a blue scaled dragoness stepped forward and added,&quot;Is something terribly amiss? Why all five of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
This dragoness was Triana, Nazaric&#39;s most valuable tactical genius and empress of the seven seas of dragons in the deep. Her beauty was unmatched in Nazaric&#39;s eyes, and only to his beloved Tyria did she compare. She could never have children and was afraid of her line ending with her, so Nazaric made her immortal and in return she serves him for eternity, and she represents motherhood in the eyes of all dragons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, I have summoned you all here, but not for battle, or tragedy. Today is a glorious day that I wish to commemorate to history,&quot; Nazaric announced and all five looked at each other when the green male out of them stepped forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re in your male form I see, this month don’t you prefer your feminine appearance to encourage the females to breed? You’re a symbol for fertility as well as prosperity my lord,&quot; the green male, Itzwald exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Itzwald is the highest priest for Nazaric, and in addition to his immortality has been granted an ability to switch genders in order to appeal to a wider range of audiences amongst dragon-kind. Itzwald also made sure those freshly turned from humans to dragons kept their place, and some were chosen to be reincarnated with their former memories in tact to live a second life by him, that is if they were worthy. His role amongst the five represented diversity, clarity, and patience within the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh.... w-why are you uh... male great l-lord?&quot; A pink scaled female asked, who appeared heavily gravid with four pairs of swollen breasts and belly that looked ready to burst.<br />
<br />
This was Cathrine, the only former human Nazaric allowed into the five, and the newest member. At first she was male and Nazaric sentenced her to live out the rest of her life giving birth to children. Itzwald seemed to take a shine to her after awhile and visited her in both forms. Cathrine seemed to accept her role as a mother within a mere day or two and Itzwald vouched on her behalf. After a meeting with Nazaric himself the god made the process of giving birth painless to Cathrine, gave her immortality, and multiple breasts for her to take care of her infinite amounts of children. Currently she’s mates with Itzwald and as his consort gave him full control over when she gave birth. Cathrine represents passion and love, and she is a symbol of fertility amongst females, although never a god of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore, that role goes to another now,&quot; Nazaric exclaimed as one dragon on the end with purple scales paused and spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, if not you then who? What happened to you? Is our race going to be extinct if there’s no existing got to grant us that honor?&quot; The purple dragon asked concerned.<br />
<br />
Finally there was Xyvard, a male dragon who’s the elite-most scholar in search of knowledge to this very day. His goal in life was to find infinite wisdom. He came to Nazaric and stated that he knew knowledge that even the god did not. Nazaric initial was offended and was astonished to hear some of the male&#39;s knowledge after being challenged to a battle of intellect. Xyvard put everything at stake when he challenged Nazaric and if he lost then he would have all of his knowledge erased, and be turned into a hatchling or the opposite sex. However, his courage, intellect and determination earned him a spot amongst the rest, and was granted the ability of foresight in addition to eternal life, and has a secret mateship to Triana that nobody knows about but the five and Nazaric himself.<br />
<br />
All five looked at Nazaric shocked in disbelief and generally worried until he smiled and laughed,&quot;Oh Xyvard, the last time I saw that look on your face I was two seconds from turning you into a hatchling. But again this isn’t a time to worry, but a time to rejoice and cheer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what is it? You almost gave me a heart attack when we ALL gathered here,&quot; Cathrine cried and Itzwald looked to her and gave her a comforting nuzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, Cathrine that isn’t possible when we can’t die, but second please don’t scare us like that,&quot; Itzwald replied to the two of them and Nazaric nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apologies, you both must have so many hatchlings to feed, but the reason I called you all here is because I found something that has been missing in my life since the day the stars started to shine,&quot; Nazaric stated then smiled,&quot;I finally found a worthy mortal whom I claimed as my consort and mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every dragon present practically jumped back out of astonishment, all except for Xyvard, who seemed rather calm. &quot;I knew it, but I didn’t want to tell you my lord for fears that it would somehow change the future. For the same reason I didn’t tell any of you as to not spread rumors, sorry Triana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Triana looked over at Xyvard and said,&quot;I... understand, but... wow....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is she?&quot; Cathrine asked wagging her tail,&quot;Can we meet her soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, who? None of my people seemed to fit your.... tastes. Cathrine also why do you assume they’re female?&quot; Tharix asked raising his brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... because lord Nazaric is... male...&quot; She muttered and in response and Itzwald sighed and nuzzled Cathrine’s cheek and said,&quot;Be patient my mate, let him tell us the story in its entirety.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nazaric nodded and took a deep breath and announced,&quot;Indeed, they are female, but originally they were a human male, who somehow acquired an ability that should only be available to a god. She also had a taste of lust and attraction that I found most suitable, and so she became my mate, my goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Tharix roared<br />
<br />
&quot;A human huh?&quot; Triana muttered and Cathrine giggled,&quot;I think Tharix owes me a small fraction of his hoard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharix paused and looked over to Cathrine and then Xyvard and snarled,&quot;Did you two know about this?! Did you tell her to screw me over Xyvard?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said I kept everything a secret, although I did foresee you reacting this way and I believe we can defuse the situation by offering you a humanoid form to make better use of human weaponry.&quot; Xyvard said and he nodded to Nazaric, who snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
A mark appeared on Tharix&#39;s front right claw and as he moved closer to examine it the mark engulfed his body in light. When the light subsided Tharix now stood on two feet and in a new anthropomorphic dragon form that was incredibly muscular from head to toe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better?&quot; Itzwald asked and Tharix sighed and gave a small nod in response as Cathrine snickered a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways I was planning on it, but first I need all of you to spread the word about her to your lands by any means necessary, and I will ask that one of you stay behind and perhaps help her... step in if I’m not around for her,&quot; Nazaric exclaimed and all of them looked to one another and paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m interested in how a human, especially a male human would obey as a present goddess,&quot; Tharix exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Triana nodded and said,&quot;I might be able to help her adapt to a more feminine life, or at least one of an... empress... I mean that’s more or less what happens around here from my knowledge, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can certainly help out with mental adjustment to being a female,&quot; Itzwald said then his body gave off a faint green glow and everyone looked at him as he assumed a female form with E cup breasts and a womb and giggled,&quot;Especially if she’s pregnant like many of those I deal with.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cathrine rolled her eyes and smiled at her mate,&quot;Oh Izzy, you’re so cute when you turn female,&quot; She laughed and everyone turned to her now as she sat down on her haunches. &quot;I’d love to talk to someone like her, we have so much in common, and since she’s not like the others Izzy deals with it’ll be nice. I’ve been waiting to meet someone who doesn’t just talk about laying eggs, feeding children by breast, sex, or just all three things at once, plus she was human like me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone continued to stare at Cathrine for a few minutes and Tharix looked to Itzwald and asked,&quot;Izzy...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Itzwald blushed and laughed,&quot;It’s a name I’ve taken to alright? Cathrine says it fits me, and it’s one of those cute human ones too, so I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Xyvard gave them a small smile and chuckled,&quot;Well I’m not so sure how sociable I can be with her, but I am at least intrigued with the coming of your clutch. A new age is going to dawn soon, the age of new draconic gods to nurture and groom, and if you’d like a direct approach...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHE&#39;S PREGNANT?!&quot; Cathrine roared out and looked over at Xyvard who fell silent, as everyone in the room now looked to her and then him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Nazaric&#39;s grace, I’ve got to meet her now! I’ve just to see how her little hatchlings turn out!&quot; Cathrine shrieked then paused and asked,&quot;Uh... how big will they be compared to us my lord?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nazaric paused and looked down at Xyvard with a small blush on his face, and there was an awkward silence in the room. Tharix smiled at this and laughed,&quot;Ha! That’s a rare sight, Nazaric did Xyvard tell you something you didn’t know about yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nazaric looked around to the ground and slowly gave a small nod,&quot;We just mated for the first time tonight, she’s exhausted and asleep. But, considering Xyvard&#39;s little outburst I must now ask that you all swear to never speak of her pregnancy until she starts showing physical signs.&quot;<br />
<br />
All five of them looked up at Nazaric and nodded then Xyvard sighed and bowed,&quot;My apologies, my visions don’t usually tell me how significant the event is, nor the distant from the present. Needless to say that it shall happen soon... they always seem to do so within a couple years or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait isn’t that about how long gestation is?&quot; Itzwald asked and Cathrine nodded and said,&quot;It’s our tradition remember? The people gather around me and for three days straight I lay eggs while they watch, the Festival of Fertility we call it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn’t that coming up soon?&quot; Triana asked smiling at them,&quot;I think I might make an appearance then, it’s always so hard to keep track of surface events, especially since most live under the earth now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A week or so, I hope it’s not overshadowed by this though,&quot; Itzwald added and Nazaric nodded and said,&quot;So everything is in order then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharix paused and looked up at Nazaric curiously and asked,&quot;Um... what is sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we shall all work together in order to prepare Tyria, my consort and goddess, into her new position as best we can. For the meantime though, I believe she’s more accustomed to my company,&quot; Nazaric exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... not to ruin anything but won’t you have to do that yourself lord Nazaric? Usually the people get skeptical if I just announce something new was added to the tomes of worship, especially something like this,&quot; Itzwald exclaimed and Xyvard nodded,&quot;That will be an issue...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nazaric slowly nodded to this and said,&quot;Then I shall address my people, first to the mountains, then to the seas, and finally those who lay beneath. However, until I return I must have one of you watch my beloved Tyria and make sure she is safe while I am away.&quot;<br />
<br />
With this all five looked up at Nazaric shocked as he chose one of them to look after his newfound mate. But who was his choice, and what did Tyria wake up to?<br />
