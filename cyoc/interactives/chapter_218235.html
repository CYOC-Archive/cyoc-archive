<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking in a deep breath to relief herself that this was a big decision to make on her coronation for Whoever she chooses first to dance the first dance with her will break the others heart as this was going to be her first step with someone through out the kingdom of all the lands, the seas, and of the skies. As everyone near and far from across the lands of the enchanting beast of all kinds, to the lords and ladies from the land, sky, and the seas of neighboring kingdoms were waiting to see who she&#39;ll dance with for the first dance on princess Aurora&#39;s coronation that the toad king with his beautiful swan queen, sir John Braveheart with Ciela, the jaguar, the human sized red dragon, Merlin the wise with Melida Bowen, and more of the grope were going through the same possess of wanting to know who was going to be dancing the first dance with princess aurora for there can be only one to choose from. with the gifts setting on a table in the grand hall that she slowly approached her people of her guest as she had to take care of some lose ends first, with her friends of hers.<br />
<br />
as she walked by some of the guys that the first person she stopped to was a humanoid six point buck deer in knightly armor from the enchanted forest kingdom, named Big Serow. Big Serow was always there when she wanted to talk with him as he helps her about making some big decisions, almost like his was a counseller. Aurora took a deep breath, before she decided to speak to him about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big Serow, there&#39;s something I need to know right now.&quot; princess Aurora said as Big Serow was thinking on what was on her mind now, yet the others wondered if he was going to be asked for the first dance with the princess that this was on his mind also. little did they know, she was about to ask a different question to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;will you be my chancellor?&quot; Aurora said that this stuns Big serow for a loop. he blinked a couple of times to processed this, before speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;me? but... i&#39;m just a deer from the enchanted forest kingdom next door.&quot; Big Serow said, trying to get the princess to understand of his possession on what she was asking of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes, but with the best instinct of the kingdom.&quot; the princess said that this made him reassure of himself that he kindly looked towards the swan queen as she gently smiled back at him for it was his decision to make, along with the frog king with its fairies. looking back to her, he gave his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes. of course I will.&quot; he said that this made his parents of a coyote, and a big old bear so proud of him. &quot;that&#39;s our Big Serow.&quot; was all that was said, before they snugged on him for a big hug on each side. moving aside to the right a bit that Aurora was shortly talking things over with her own caption of her knight&#39;s guard, Phillip as he was human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phillip... you&#39;ve been by my side since my first day of rule, and you&#39;ve proven yourself a worthy caption of the guard. which is why i&#39;m promoting you to general, effective immediately.&quot; Aurora said towards Philip.<br />
<br />
caption Philip, now a general gave his best salute to her. &quot;it would be my honor.&quot; he then waved it off that his parents were so proud for their son as his mom leaned onto his right shoulder, while his dad had a hand to his left shoulder. there were no words up to this moment for him, and his family as they were happy for their son.<br />
<br />
looking over to the right more that Merlin the wise and Melida Bowen had a grandson as he was studying both of his grandparent&#39;s skills and lessons when he was just five to seven years of age, along with swordsman and battle skills from his uncle who was now retired from the position of being a general of the knights for he was also attending princess Aurora&#39;s coronation while being called Michel Collin. though he was not related by blood by the two for MC, as he would like to call himself, was actually a nice enough lizardmen while the grandson, Cain Von Wolford, was merely adopted by the two great mages for being a black tiger with bright colored strips of red, yellow, and orange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cain... we&#39;ve been through so much together, you and I. and now look at you, a true master wizard. which will be your tidal, from this day forward.&quot; Aurora said that the three shortly were happy for him that Melida Bowen soon hugged him.<br />
<br />
&quot;master wizard, Cain. i&#39;m so proud!&quot; Melida Bowen said that his grandpa Merlin was balling his eyes out for him in happy tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;congratulations kid. we knew that you&#39;ve could do it.&quot; his uncle said as he placed his reptile like hand on his right shoulder, while patting him on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;thanks Aurora.&quot; Cain said as he then tapped his fingers together, like someone was planing on something. &quot;now, about the first dance.&quot; was all that was said of him, before moving on over to the right once more towards her majestic bright blue winged jaguar friend with dark blue triangle spots with red wings and the tip of its tail as he goes by the name Derek. Derek started living here since Aurora was no older then twelve years of age as he was mostly a representative from the kingdom of Avalor, but when he was attacked that she was the one who mended his wounds and helped heal him up by bandaging his worst injuries from his wings to one point of time towards his legs in which he was eventually kept as a gift towards her through out their friendships.<br />
<br />
&quot;Derek! today you&#39;ve showed great ingenuity and even greater courage, even before the coronation could ever happen today. so, how would you like to be the royal inventor chief of staff towards both Chip & dale.&quot; Aurora said that the two chipmunks were jumping with joy as they get to finally invent stuff for the princess.<br />
<br />
Dale said, &quot;woah! did you hear that?! we get to work on inventions while in the work shop!&quot; to Chip for he said with a backwards flip, &quot;heh, yippee!&quot; they shortly started chanting together for it was like this. &quot;build it, build it build it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek jumped up to her as if he was a dog to not only nuzzle her, but to also hug her. &quot;I won&#39;t let you down.&quot; he said for the two kindly were looking towards one another at a moment. during this, she was thinking back on all the memories they each shared with him for he too was also remembering the times with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;now, I do believe that I have a decision to make.&quot; Aurora said as she looked towards at her friends for they too were looking back, ready to be picked. thinking this through that they looked a bit nervous, but she had already thought it through as she wanted to tie up some lose ends up first for she shortly turned towards where sir John Breaveheart was at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir John Breaveheart!&quot; the princess said that he was stun at first. and yet, he was soon smiling. &quot;no one has helped me learned how to rule more than you. would you honor me with the first dance?&quot;<br />
<br />
hearing this call, he softly approached her. gently holding up her hands that this is what he had to say. &quot;for you, I would be honored.&quot; and with that, they started dancing together as the music started to play. to Aurora as this was like dancing with her father, yet for Sir John Breaveheart that this felt like he was dancing with his own daughter. while they danced that they hoped for this special moment could last forever as they know for when the sun sets down, it would be time for her curse to set upon her. until then, they held in each others arms as they danced.</p>
