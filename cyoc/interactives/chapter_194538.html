<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was after school when it happened at long last.<br />
<br />
Lars had been dealing with his recent issues as best he could - if he couldn&#39;t have his usual protein bars, maybe it would be better to just make a smoothie out of the healthiest items at home. It would likely not taste the best, but for his health, Lars was willing to make that sacrifice. At present, he was dressed in a tight blue tank top and shorts - today it seemed the weather was warmer, more humid, and set off a need to bare some skin to deal with it. Honestly, if he could, Lars felt he would go to school in a posing strap - so confident was he in his physical beauty.<br />
<br />
But as he was heading off to go to the gym, making a stop at the locker room to get everything ready, he saw Rudy Garlant standing by the doorway. Seeming to just be nervously waiting there. Lars had a basic idea of what Rudy might be doing here. But he didn&#39;t want to betray any indication he knew the dark haired jock&#39;s secrets. So he mirthfully went about his business, and even decided to bait Rudy forward a little bit more.<br />
<br />
He made a point of stripping out of his clothes from the school day only to pick out from his backpack some workout gear. Testing and trying them out. He knew he had a voyeur, and if anything, that made Lars do what he was doing even more so. <br />
<br />
Lars stretched and flexed his glutes and legs right then and there while he knew Rudy was watching. Enticing those latent and long denied homosexual impulses to the surface. Was Rudy truly gay? Bi? Some permutation thereof where he was only attracted to certain guys? Lars did not know and did not care.<br />
<br />
This was the sexy culmination of everything he had done thus far to and by Rudy Garlant. Lars looked in one of the mirrors by the wall, and saw Rudy had moved closer, inching closer and closer to the blond athlete currently strutting his stuff in the locker room. They were alone here now. So very alone. There was a bathroom area there, connected to it, that would further eliminate much risk in any coupling that occurred.<br />
<br />
Lars considered Rudy Garlant and his looks. Not quite as tall as Lars was, Rudy was nevertheless regarded as a classically handsome man - tall, dark, handsome and muscular. His was not exactly the Hollywood caliber of musculature one might expect. Rather, Rudy was a huge linebacker, prioritizing more size and strength above appearance. But even that bequeathed him a certain appealing quality that many women on campus were keen to appreciate.<br />
<br />
His gut was not exactly pendulous, but was tight if lacking tone, and bulged out just enough to give him a sense of heft. His shoulders and arms were massive and yet lacked the veins and tone that Lars enjoyed. His wide back pushed his frame outward. Rudy had a brutish, bully boy face that might&#39;ve intimidated some of the smaller students just by a look. But today, that gruff, cleanshaven face was beside itself with scarcely concealed lust.<br />
<br />
Rudy had had many girlfriends, but there was always an aspect, Lars had found, that he couldn&#39;t quite get from them. And it was in Rudy&#39;s micromanaging of Lars Olsen that it became obvious what Rudy wanted.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Lars played it like he was just about to go out to lift weights when he &quot;first saw&quot; Rudy standing there. Not far away at all. Just openly there in the little hallway, right by the empty coach&#39;s office. A bead of sweat on his face. Obviously still attempting self control even if both he and Lars both knew deep down what was due to happen today.<br />
<br />
&quot;...You put on quite a fucking show there, Lars.&quot; Rudy started, gritting his teeth, &quot;Did you...did you even think of what it might do? Do to someone who might...uh, be watching you? Who might walk in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You hadn&#39;t just walked in,&quot; Lars said in a gleeful tone, &quot;You were watching. You liked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rudy snarled, looking down for a moment, and by the time he looked back, Lars was moving in closer to him. The Norwegian jock asked in a breathy tone, &quot;Can I get by...? Or do you have something to tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
That finished off Rudy&#39;s restraint.<br />
<br />
Rudy suddenly gripped Lars&#39; shoulders, and the blond jock knew he had finally unleashed what lurked within Rudy Garlant. After so long a time spent buried. Even so, the pretenses that Rudy maintained had to be acted upon. There needed to be abstraction. Maintaining his image. He had a figure and a concept of himself to maintain. &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; Rudy gulped down saliva, &quot;I&#39;m not gay.&quot; He started, even as his grip on Lars&#39; broad shoulders turned to massaging the muscles there, &quot;I&#39;m not gay...not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you are,&quot; Lars said, &quot;It&#39;s pretty obvious you want something, Rudy. What is it you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
The enormous linebacker audibly growled in the back of his throat, fighting his restraint and his dueling needs...all the way up until he decided there was no risk here. One hand move down to Lars&#39; ass, cupping the generous cheeks, and the other moved up to his head, and pushed the blond into a thirsty and desperate kiss. Rudy even still fought to maintain his concept of himself. Was he murmuring &quot;I&#39;m not gay&quot; between kisses...? <br />
<br />
What a commitment to labels and his own standing. Lars readily returned the kiss, and outright returned the favor. His talented hand reaching up Rudy&#39;s shirt and pinching a nipple. The act of doing so made Rudy moan outright into the kiss, and he roughly pushed Lars against the wall...<br />
<br />
And in turn, Lars utilized his own strength to push Rudy back around, hands feeling up the meaty and closeted jock&#39;s body. &quot;You&#39;re so fucking thick, bro.&quot; In more ways than one. &quot;Fuck, what do you wanna d-do from here...?&quot; Lars was eager to see whatever it was that Rudy decided he wanted to do.<br />
<br />
But whatever it was, Rudy had pushed himself into the path of the curse still working its way through Lars Olsen.</p>
