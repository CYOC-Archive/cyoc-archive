<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mac and Frank left the control room and started down the hall.  They turned a corner and were reunited with George and the rest.<br />
<br />
George smiled seeing that Frank had his arm around Mac's shoulder and Mac had his arm around Frank's waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you two have managed to kiss and make up.&quot;  George said with a big toothy grin.<br />
<br />
Frank grunted, &quot;Yeah, well, I'm still not too happy about what I've become, but I must admit,&quot; Frank paused, stretched and flexed his muscles, &quot;I like the power this body has.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot;  Mac said, &quot;and the improved sex drive ain't half bad either!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a general chuckle though the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, George, I see we've got another badger in the group.&quot;  Mac said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!  This is the badger-man Rothman harvested sperm from to change you Mac.  This is Rusty.&quot;  George said.<br />
<br />
Mac looked Rusty over, he felt a twinge in his balls.  Rusty responded in a similar way.<br />
<br />
George cleared his throat, &quot;Ummm... Mac, we don't have time for that now.  After we're out, we can find a secluded spot and satisfy our needs.&quot;  Frank was looking George over, he felt new attraction for his old friend.  <br />
<br />
&quot;When we have time, buddy.&quot;  George said, noticing the desire in Frank's eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like that.&quot;  Frank growled.  Norman squeezed George's shoulder gently.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK Norman, I we won't leave you out, will we Frank.&quot;  George said turning to Norman who stood just behind George with his arm resting on his Papa's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Frank said, &quot;wouldn't dream of leaving him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are we gettin' out?&quot;  Mac asked?<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on and tell 'em, son.&quot;  George said.<br />
<br />
Norman bashfully came forward and explained what he had to the others earlier.<br />
<br />
After twenty more minutes of refining the plan, the group headed out.<br />
<br />
Anton and Billy headed up the elevator shaft.  Being more agile and faster climbers, they were on point.<br />
<br />
It took an hour or more to climb to the first level.  The elevator door on level one was jammed open and strangely, it seemed the level was deserted.<br />
<br />
Slowly the team moved out of the shaft.  Behind squirrel boy Anton Miloktov and the mountain lion Billy Ross came the black bears: Frank Marshall, Ian Scott, Robert Ivers, Dan Harris, Franklin Keith.  Followed by the badgers Rusty and Mack Blocker.  Finally George Harding, who was a hybrid of kodiak and black bear and Norman Lee who was George's kodiak cub.<br />
<br />
The group, was eleven in all and they fanned out cautiously, weapons drawn, into the lobby area.<br />
<br />
It was very early in the morning and there was no one at all around.  Slowly, they checked around.  All the exits, seemed to be still locked by the power failure.  The security consoles were dead.  <br />
<br />
George cautiously opened up a control room just off the main lobby and discovered something very interesting.  Dace and his team of six cleaners were lying on the floor, completely unconscious.<br />
<br />
Mac looked in and said, &quot;Looks like someone set off the knock out gas when they were trying to restore power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mac grinned, &quot;I've got a little present for our friend Dace here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Within a few minutes, Mac had emptied the spray bottle he'd used on Frank and his team.  Frank wasn't too happy about the plan until Mac pointed out that Dace and his team would make really good allies once they discovered that they were on the wrong side of the fence.<br />
<br />
Mac brought Norman over, pricked his finger and squeezed a good amount of hybrid kodiak blood into the spray bottle.  Mac filled the bottle with water and swished it around to mix the blood well with the water.<br />
<br />
Mac removed the mask Dace had started to put on.  Dace was a nice big burly man with lightning reflexes and extensive training in tactics and martial arts.  He was a killing machine; just the sort of anthropomorph that would give any military types a fit.  Dace was damned handsome too and Mac felt stirrings, but he didn't have time to mate with Dace and felt that kodiak would be a stronger form for the big man anyway.<br />
<br />
He sprayed Dace in the face as the man breathed in, but just to be sure, he opened his mouth and squirted a few times.  That being done, he went to the other six men and gave them the same treatment.  He then scavenged what equipment he could find from the sleeping teams including some night vision goggles, some packaged food, tranquilizers and antidotes and guns and ammo of course.<br />
<br />
The unconscious team was beginning to stir when Mac closed and locked the door.  Soon, Dace and his team would all be experiencing the orgasmic bliss of fucking as grizzlies.  <br />
<br />
With that, the team of eleven cautiously headed out through the main doors and into the forest.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
Dace woke and felt a strange tingling in his balls.  He heard the moans of his team as they began to awaken.<br />
<br />
He was going to have to officially reprimand Hawkins for being stupid enough to trigger the knock out gas.  Mike Hawkins was slumped over by the control panel, still snoring.  Dace was feeling really horny now and through the cloud of confusion and his slight headache, a realization was beginning to dawn on him... he felt itchy, he was horny and he could feel his muscles twitching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Fuck!&quot;  Dace said out loud in a voice that was becoming a gravely growl of a male grizzly hybrid, though he had no idea what species he was becoming, &quot;I've been infected!&quot;<br />
<br />
The next thought Dace had was very homoerotic and Dace was a very straight man up until now.  The vision of him as a bear, pulling Hawkins' pants down and fucking him was sending tingles of pleasure from his crotch up his back and throughout his body.  <br />
<br />
Hawkins, the clumsy  oaf, was lying over the control panel in the perfect position.  <br />
<br />
Dace shook his head, Scratched at his growing beard.  He was oozing pre-come already and caught himself rubbing his crotch and stopped.<br />
<br />
Dace itched all over and needed to scratch badly, the itch was almost maddening.  He had to get out of his uniform now!</p>
