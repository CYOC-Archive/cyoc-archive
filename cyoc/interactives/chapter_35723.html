PART FIVE<br />
JIM HAVE A GROWING EXPERIENCE<br />
<br />
Max helped Jim into the break area of the lifeguard station. &quot; Ya know that I always love that body of yours.&quot; Max says as he lowers him to the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. I do try to stay in shape for the job.&quot;  Jim settles down onto the overstuffed couch. &quot;Can you get me a drink from the fridge?&quot;<br />
<br />
Max retrieves a bottle and hands it to Jim. &quot;Here ya go boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jim opens the bottle of water and takes a small sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any news on the transfer?&quot; Max inquires.<br />
<br />
&quot;The letter is in my duffle bag over there. I haven't had the chance to open it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll save you the trouble.&quot; Max gets the letter from the bag and rips open the letter. He reads it to himself for a few seconds. <br />
<br />
&quot;DEAR MR SAMLAS,    <br />
<br />
AS YOU WELL KNOW YOUR CURRENT ASSIGNMENT IS ONLY A TEMPORARY ONE. YOUR ARREST TO CONVICTION AVERAGES SPEAKS FOR ITS SELF. THE CRIME RATE AT THE BEACH RESORTS IS DOWN. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK OUT THERE. <br />
<br />
YOUR REQUEST FOR PERMINATE TRANSFER TO THE FLORDIA D.E.A. TASK FORCE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. YOUR TRANSFER PAPERS ARE BEING PROCCESS AT THE WRITING OF THIS LETTER. <br />
<br />
AS REQUESTED YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR UNDER COVER POSITION AS A LIFEGUARD IN DE SOTO COUNTY. <br />
<br />
TO INSURE THAT YOUR UNDERCOVER POSITION IS NOT COMPROMIZED, PLEASE DESTROY THIS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION LINKING YOU TO THE D.E.A. THAT MAY BE IN YOUR POSSESSION.<br />
<br />
WELCOME TO THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENTCY.<br />
<br />
Signed,<br />
Blackman, Arnold S.<br />
Director Florida D.E.A.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations there boy.&quot;  Max hands the letter to Jim. &quot;You've hit the big time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim re-reads the letter. &quot;Thank you Max.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya now know there are more drugs out there than heroin, crack and marijuana that they use down there in Miami.&quot; Max does a double bicep pose for Jim. &quot;Up here they use the good stuff. We have HGH, steroids and all that other illegal crap. There are a lot of wannabes out there that wanna be this big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it is illegal there is a black market for it. That's why I here.&quot; Jim starts to get up from the couch but falls back again. &quot;Whoa! I never had such a bad case of heat stroke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy it aint even summer and you are already complain-n-bout the weather. Max picks up Jim by the shoulders. &quot;Now let's see what I have to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE are gonna haveta to get ya bulked up boy. No dealer is gonna talk to your skinny ass. We need to get you into the gym and on my special program. You need to widen your shoulders, broaden your back and thicken up that chest.<br />
<br />
As Max touches each area, Jim's torso grows broader, thicker and wider. He moves his hands down Jim's sides. His obloquies widen creating the “V” taper. Like an eraser on a chalkboard Max's hands magically takes away the body fat and replaces it with muscle. Jim's abdominal muscles deepen into a more defined eight pac.<br />
<br />
Max starts to insert his hands under the waistband of Jim's shorts but stops. He brings his hands back up Jim's chest pausing at his pecs brushing them lightly. A moan comes out of Jim's mouth. Max continues up to the shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who needs to carry a weapon when you can carry a set of huge guns.&quot; Max slides his hands over Jim's broad shoulders down to his biceps and triceps. They grew larger forcing both of his arms farther away from his body<br />
<br />
&quot;But all that muscle on top looks out of place with those skinny legs of yours.&quot; Max, keeping his eyes on the face, reaches down feeling Jim's legs. The legs go through a similar muscular growth phase. Even though they were defined before they have now thickened to twice their original size. <br />
<br />
Max brings his hands back up to Jim's mid section pausing only for a few seconds. He slips his hand inside Jim's shorts. &quot;You need to get rid of these loose fitting short that you like to wear. You should show the world that package you have hidden under here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim's lifeguard swimsuit disappears leaving him in a pair of tight fitting red Speedos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show everyone how thick and long it is.” Max gives Jims bulge a little squeeze. “Show them that wonderful ass of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The front of Jim's red Speedos begins to grow bigger. The bulge is so pronounced that it’s now bigger than Max's large hand. The weight of the bulge pulls down the top of the suit exposing a bit of pubic hair. The white first aid cross on the back of the Speedos appeared to be moving farther south. The spandex material slides down Jim's ass until the top of his but crack appears. <br />
<br />
Now if I could only make you taller I would make you six foot four&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim's body began to elongate. Within a few minutes his height goes from five foot eight to his new height. The taller and beefer Jim is almost eye-to-eye with Max.<br />
  <br />
Neither Max nor Jim seems to notice that Jim's body had gone through some changes.<br />
<br />
Through all of his physical transformation Jim's psychological makeup had changed too. His mind and body were now one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be proud of your Bodybuilding Lifeguard title.&quot; Max runs his hands over Jim's now hairless body. He could almost feel the blood being pumped through the network of veins just under the skin. Max steps close to Jim and kisses him on the lips again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that you are wearing that New N2N suit I sent you.&quot; Max says copping another feel of Jim's bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;You always seem to know what I like to wear.&quot; Jim returns the favor and lightly gives Max's black Speedos a squeeze. &quot;I can tell you like it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You betcha buddy boy.”<br />
<br />
“As much as I like being with you Max my break is over.”  Jim drinks the rest of the contents of the bottle. “Are we still on for the new club tonight?<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t miss it.” As Max follows Jim to the door he says. “Who'd think that they would come up with a night club just for bodybuilders?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two big muscle guys exit the beach office clad only in their Speedos. Each one had his hand on the ass of the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The beach crowd had been waiting for the bodybuilder to exit the building. They had seen the muscle guy help the ailing lifeguard into the beach office. Everyone was concerned about their favorite lifeguard but they also wanted to get a look at that big guy again. That was until those two very large bodybuilders came out. The world knew then that two muscle guys would be coming out. After all two did go into the building. Everyone expected this to happen, everyone except for the four collage guys<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that the motorcycle cop I changed this morning?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He looks bigger in those Speedos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say who's that guy with him? Isn't that the lifeguard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like him. How did he get so big?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man he looks great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty. Did you change the lifeguard?&quot; Dustin asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't do anything to him, Scouts Honor.&quot; Ty said doing the Boy Scout hand sign.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you were going to lay off the transformations today:&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that I wouldn't change any of you guys.” Replies Ty. “Although, who knows what kind of fun we could have here today. <br />
<br />
&quot;But that still doesn't answer the question. Who changed the lifeguard into a bodybuilding lifeguard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have been our motorcycle cop.” Ty says. “I did give him the muscle touch. But it was only suppose to change his fellow officers.&quot;</p>
