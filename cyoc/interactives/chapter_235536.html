<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice went to the kitchen in quite a huff. How dare Jake make such a tasteless joke. Alice had to admit that she was overly sensitive about her body, but Jake knew that. He should have known better! How would he feel if he had to go through life with society so intent on scrutinising his body. All Jake had to do was get an occasional haircut and a shave. That was all society expected of a man. For a woman it was different. She had to shave her legs, indeed shave all her body hair, watch her weight, get expensive hair styling and apply makeup every day - just to comply with societies, and Jake&#39;s expectations!<br />
<br />
She extracted a frozen casserole from the freezer and shoved it into the microwave.  He was such a sexist! She was expected to cook dinner every night, make the bed every morning, do the washing, vacuum the floors - the list went on!<br />
<br />
And what does Jake do? Without consulting her he spends God knows how much on a machine that turns you into an inanimate object and then proceeds to emasculate himself. Well technically she pushed the button that emasculated him, but she was just complying with his explicit desire. She might be married to him but she couldn&#39;t pretend to understand him.<br />
.........<br />
Meanwhile in the bedroom Jake was still contemplating the clothes Alice had put on the bed. Should he or shouldn&#39;t he? Was Alice serious in wanting him to wear the skirt? He wasn&#39;t sure. She certainly had seemed angry. Perhaps he did need to do as she said to appease her. It made sense in a way. He suspected his own clothes would no longer fit his lower body. His bum was a lot bigger. If he put his own jeans on he would not be able to do up the fly. The legs would also be too long. Jake estimated he had lost about 4 inches in height. An alternative would be to wear a pair of Alice&#39;s jeans, but she was in a foul mood and had expressly told him wear these clothes, she had not given him permission to go through her wardrobe to find something he was more comfortable wearing.<br />
<br />
He picked up the purple panties. They were very feminine, with a lacy front and a satin back. At least she hadn&#39;t presented him with one of her G-strings. He guessed the panties would be more comfortable than his own boxers, that was assuming the boxers would even fit over his hips. Jake also had to admit that he was turned on by the idea of wearing the sexy clothes. With that thought he stepped into them and pulled them up. They were a perfect fit and emphasised his smooth crotch.  <br />
<br />
Jake then picked up the black skirt. He recognised the item. He had admired Alice&#39;s backside while she was wearing it. If he remembered correctly it was called a pencil skirt. It had a zip on one side and a split on the other side. He undid the zip, then stepped into it. He was slightly worried his waist may have been too thick, but it wasn&#39;t. It zipped up readily, with the waist band sitting just below his belly button where he was still 100% Alice. Jake twirled in front of the mirror admiring how the skirt emphasised his lower figure. Alice did have a good figure. His attempted joke had been in poor taste.<br />
<br />
Next Jake sat on the bed and placed the shoes onto each of his feet before buckling them up. As he had expected they were also a perfect fit. The heels were of about 5cm tall and about 1 cm wide. Gingerly he stood up. They were more comfortable than he had expected and he actually enjoyed regaining some of his lost height. Again he admired the reflection in the mirror. <br />
<br />
Of course Jake also needed to wear some sort of shirt. He still had his own upper body so he cautiously stepped to his own wardrobe and selected a white business shirt. He recalled Alice matching this skirt with a white shirt and decided to do the same. Back at the mirror he experimented with tucking the shirt into the skirt or not. He decided that the tucked in look was better.<br />
<br />
He finished dressing just in time for Alice to call out &quot;Dinners ready&quot;</p>
