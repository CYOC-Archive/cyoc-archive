<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty shifted uneasily, as he realized how much the same he currently felt. He had no tail, he had no fur, no snout, no claws, no sharp teeth, and he didn't think he felt a vagina. He opened his eyes and stared at his body.<br />
He didn't see any difference at all. He didn't even look like he belonged in a comic book, considering his depth, and apparent realness. He felt immensely dissapointed.<br />
The screaming went on. The sound of a couple crashes and loud bangs occured, and he quickly got to his feet.<br />
A slight breeze reminded him of the fact that he was still stark naked. He swore under his breath and spread out his arms, to feel the clothes he just removed moments ago re-wrap themselves around his body. <br />
&quot;Now, that's better.&quot; he sighed. Then he stared all around him, and took in his surroundings. <br />
By what he remebered of this one copy of Hurina's World that he owned, the city where the story took place was called Adrianople, and my, was it a city. Ty always wondered if the writer had gotten his inspiration for Adrianople from Batmans Gothem city, but that didn't matter now. It was almost as if someone had placed Ty in a movie version of the book he read, being that the city and all of its inhabitants seemed to look perfecly real. That made him feel better.<br />
To a certain degree.<br />
<br />
Finally, the source of the screaming presented itself. Stomping, crashing, screaming, people being trampled by an impending human wall...<br />
Ty conciously made sure that no matter what happened in the story, he could not, under any cercumstances, get killed. He was his own character. He was the reader, which gave him dominance over everything the writer had not.<br />
But this was Ty we're talking about. He was in complete control.<br />
As far as he was concerned, he was the new main character of a new comic, with Heroes from another story.<br />
At last, the monster was realized. Anton, the Bull-man mentioned earlier, charged across the street. His hoof-like hands and back legs working together in a somewhat human way, but still greatly resembling that of a raging Steer. The sound of his angry gallop reverberated across the cityscape, and he skidded to a stop, right in front of where Ty would have been, if he hadn't moved immediatly the the sidewalk in his own unique way. <br />
Anton swerved his massive head from side to side, sniffing the air frantically, and then stood up to his full height.<br />
about sixteen feet, Ty wondered to himself.<br />
Anton was truly ripped. There were few other words for it. his chest measure roughly five feet from shoulder to shoulder, and his biceps resembled small watermellons, wreathed in furry, well-defined veins. Of course, his snout had an immense gold ring swaying menacingly from his nostrals, and his legs were still much like a bulls own, but designed to carry the torso upright, like a human. A very BIG human. his tail poked through a hole in a pair of gigantic jeans shorts, that hung down to his great knees, and was about the girth, and probobly twice the length of Ty's Arm. Ty was dissapointed with the shorts, knowing how much he looked foreward to his incredible package, but he always enjoyed a good story. <br />
<br />
Anton let loose an ersplitting roar that seemed more to resemble a lion, than a bull.<br />
&quot;I can't smell hir anywhere!&quot; he said, in a seemingly impossibly deep voice. &quot;I know shi is here, she would never leave Adrianople to itself! This has never happened before!&quot;<br />
&quot;Makes you think, doesn't it?&quot; said a much more human voice from above.&quot; Ty stared upward to gaze at Lorenzo, the Ram-Man. Twelve-feet Tall, and mildly muscular for someone his size. He was sitting on top of a shatered fruit stand with his gloved hands behind his head. Lorenzo was fully clothed, and one of the the only ones to have done so in Hurina's World. He was dressed in black ripped jeans far larger than man size, and was wearing a white T-Shirt with the spitfire skateboarding emblem on it. The resource for such huge sets of clothing was unknown to Ty, as it had been introduced in an earlier issue, which Ty never got his hands on. Regardless, Lorenzo was big, but not as big as Anton. He had the same kind of hoof-hands as anton, and similar back legs, like a goats, and his tail too, was not all that different. he was clad in white fur, and his two large horns were decked out in several gold rings, beated into the shape of his curly natural crown. He smiled and fixed his yellowish eyes on Anton, who stared with deep brown ones back at him.<br />
&quot;Yes, chances are that Hurina certainly wouldn't leave Adrianople to us, for fear that the place may get a very destructive blowjob, but still, we didn't come out here to get our hands on her exactly, but we came here to get our hands on people who look at our crotches as weapons of mass destruction.&quot;<br />
Now Ty remembered. The whole purpose behind the story was the fact that the Anthro's enjoyed crushing people by filling them with their giant cocks, and causing them to explode in a shower of Cum once their orgasm took place. The inhabitants of Adrianople were being used as disposable sex toys the the many times stronger Anthros.<br />
<br />
Now Ty remembered why this was his favorite out of all the comic-books he owned.<br />
<br />
&quot;That silly roar of yours drove off all the humans in this part of the city, and the watch is likely going to get here soon.&quot; Lorenzo went on. &quot;Not that bullets really do all that much to us, but it's still irritating.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; Anton muttered.<br />
&quot;Anyway, lets just roam quietly, nab what humans catch our eyes, and blow it.&quot; The Ram finished.<br />
&quot;Yeah, Yeah, sorry.&quot; Anton replied. Lorenzo hopped down from his little perch and landed near his bovine counterpart. Together, they scurried off further down the streets in search of their next sources of self-pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next scene.&quot; Ty said aloud. The world around him whirled for a moment, and he found himself staring down at the beautiful image of Hurina, strapped to an elagent, but somewhat worn bed. shi was sleeping soundly, with a long piece of tape strapped to hir mouth. Ty recalled the situation.<br />
The Lion-Man, known as Sanz, and his other wildcat associates had sedated Hurina in order to get a chance to plow hir while she lay unconcious. Sanz however, kept a special telapathic serum for his chance, which will make Hurina respond to his thoughts and commands, while shi stays perfecly aware of the massive Lion inside of hir. Ty wasn't exactly in the mood for that, so he clapped his hands together and said, <br />
&quot;Now it's my turn!&quot;</p>
