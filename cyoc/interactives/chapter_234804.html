<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally and Dave are college students who have been dating for a few years. They are in their early 20s and are not yet living together. Sally has her own apartment and she lives alone but Dave spends most of his time with her at her apartment. Dave lives at the dorm as it&#39;s closer to his college. <br />
<br />
As Sally was finished with her lectures and was coming back home she noticed a little shop. It looked as if the shop was selling almost everything that you wanted. She liked the mysterious vibe of it and the name as it said magic shop so she decided to look what the shop had to offer. She has always been interested in anything spiritual and magical but could never really find anything so this was another reason to check it out. As she came into the shop she saw an old lady at the counter which she politely greeted and started to check out what the store had to offer.<br />
<br />
As she was walking around she saw multiple items that she was interested in. She saw a nice looking medallion, cute heels and an interesting pair of socks. As she was tight with money, she was looking what was the cheapest option, so she decides that she will take the socks. She also liked how comfortable the socks looked and she was looking to trying them out. She was also intrigued at what magical capability this socks had. She didn&#39;t know as the socks only had a price tag on it. She went to the counter to ask the old lady about the sock&#39;s abilities and to pay for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;d like to buy this socks but I have to know, are they really magical? What can I do with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Old lady replied: &quot;good choice dear. This socks give you the ability to change into anyone&#39;s body if you put one theirs pair of shoes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I only need a pair of shoes from someone else and I can have their bodies? No way&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. Look if you don&#39;t believe me, I&#39;ll let you return it if they don&#39;t work&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I trust you but that&#39;s unbelievable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally paid for the socks and quickly went home. She was intrigued to try the socks as soon as she would come home. She was thinking if she even had any shoes that have been worn by someone else back at her place. As she was thinking she remembered that her friend Madelyn left her shoes at her place when they went to some party a week before and she decided to ditch heels at her apartment when going home. Although she was scared that she might not even fit in the heels and socks wouldn&#39;t work, she was too excited to wait any more so she quickly went to her apartment. When she got home, she stripped naked and put on the magical socks. They felt so good on her feet as the soft fabric rubbed against them so that it almost made her tickle as she moved around. She quickly found Madelyn&#39;s heels. Madelyn&#39;s shoes were red stiletto strappy heels in size 6 and had a heel of 5 inches which Sally had never even wore. She was scared that she would destroy the heels as her feet were size 9 and she was bigger than Madelyn. Sally was curvy girl and at the height of 5&#39;8&quot; wore her thick thighs, wide hips and big ass really nice. She knew Dave loved her body, especially her feet as he had a foot fetish and gave her feet a lot of attention.  In comparison, Madelyn was a small girl at 5&#39;2&quot; with feet size 6 and slender legs, smaller hips and overall more petite. They both looked good but had totally different body types. Even other features were different such as their hair, eyes etc. Sally was beaming with excitement wanting to try the socks with her friends heels. <br />
<br />
She sat on her couch and put on Madelyn&#39;s heels. At first she thought that it would definitely not work as her feet almost could fit but after a few seconds she noticed how she could feel her feet moving inside heels and fitting inside more and more. She could not believe her eyes. She was shrinking into her friends shoes and soon they will fit her perfectly as she would have her friend&#39;s feet. She was curious how her feet looked now but didn&#39;t want to pull of her socks as she could feel changes going upwards her body. She could feel her legs getting slimmer and paler, which was a surprise since she has always had very tanned skin. She could also feel her body getting shorter and losing inches to become her small friend. As the changes moved up her leg she could feel that she now had thigh gap as her upper part of the legs and hips slimmed down. At that instant she started to feel aroused as her vagina changed to exact copy of Madelyn&#39;s. As she felt her ass change she tried to look behind and could see her ass becoming smaller and perkier. As she was watching her ass, changes continued and her soft belly changed into a fit and  slim belly with narrow waist. Her boobs changed into smaller ones from her previous B cups to A cups. Sally felt completely lost in her new body and was getting turned on as the changes progressed. She could feel her arms get thinner and her hands change shape from her previous small hands to now even smaller but with longer fingers. She could see that her nails changer from bare nails to acrylic ones painted in bright red. She remembered Madelyn having them the previous week but she remembered that her toenails were painted in the same color. She was curious to see her feet, however, she decided to wait for changes to end. She could feel her head start to change. Her face became narrower and her lips slimmed. Her hair grew out to the middle of her back and straightened as Sally usually had curly black hair. Her hair also changed color to blonde. The last change was her eyes as they become blue with perfect vision so Sally had to put her glasses down as they were not useful anymore. As she was finished with her changes she stood up and went to the mirror. As she was walking she was surprised at how easy it was walking in Madelyn&#39;s heels. She was sure that she got her muscle memory as she was never good with heels.<br />
<br />
As she saw herself in the mirror she almost laughed. She never expected to be able to have perspective trough her friend&#39;s blue eyes. She was curious about her new feet so she took off her shoes and socks and was surprised at how cute and small her feet looked now. She loved her toes which were now short and slender, topped with sexy bright red nail polish. She liked to paint her nails and take care of her feet because she liked the attention Dave was giving it to her feet. She was surprised that Madelyn feet looked effortlessly pretty with even soft soles and tall arches. She noticed that this body liked being barefoot and she now understood why Madelyn liked to ditch heels when going out partying. She also noticed that her feet and legs were starting to hurt. Sally didn&#39;t realize it immediately but she figured it must be due to her new legs being used to wearing heels. Madelyn was the smallest in their friend group so she was used to wearing heels everyday to make her taller. Due to this she could now barely stand without them. So she walked on her toes back to the heels and put them back on as it felt more natural to have her feet in this position.<br />
<br />
She was curious to try her new body. She wanted to experience life and see how her new body would react. She was very curious about having sex, does she now have different taste? She could not wait to find out more and also wanted to experiment more, maybe try out other bodies and also experiment with someone else.<br />
<br />
As she was deep in her thoughts she heard knocking on her door which quickly brought her back to her new naked body of a short skinny blonde</p>
