<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was never comfortable with myself.  I was always awkward and introverted.  I blamed it on not being able to keep up with other boys in terms of athletic ability or looks or general confidence.  I always felt that maybe I'd be better off as a girl.<br />
<br />
Now I realized that I might have that power.  The ring had already performed two amazing feats, so what else could it do?  Maybe it could help make my desire become a reality.  I had to know.<br />
<br />
I walked into my bedroom and stripped myself naked.  I realized that I did not have a mirror in my room, so I wished that I would have a full length mirror appear in my room.  Instantly it appeared.  I walked in front of it and saw the reflection of my unremarkable male body.  I took a deep breath.  &quot;I wish that my body would become my ideal version of a female body, but that I would be able to switch back to my male body with ease,&quot; I said.  I added the last bit just in case things didn't work out the way I imagined.<br />
<br />
I waited.  Nothing seemed to change.  All of my preceding wishes seemed to take effect instantly.  But absolutely nothing seemed different after this wish.  I kept waiting...and hoping.  I waited another minute, but still nothing changed.  Oh well, I thought.  It was worth the try.  <br />
<br />
I took a step back from the mirror.  When my foot landed I heard a rather strange sound.  It sounded like something flopping against the floor.  I looked at my foot.  It looked strange.  I reached down to feel it and it didn't feel solid.  In fact as I touched my toes, there was nothing under them.  They were empty!<br />
<br />
Now I was worried.  I looked at the mirror.  I looked over the rest of my body.  In several places my skin looked very strange.  In some places, particularly around my hips and chest, my skin looked stretched very tight.  However, in my arms, legs, and stomach, my skin looked loose and practically sagged.  My worry fast became panic.  <br />
<br />
I looked at my face in the mirror and saw similarities.  My skin was tight around my cheeks and loose around my chin.  Suddenly I saw something shiny at the back of the top of my head.  It was easy to spot since I wore my hair in a crew cut.  I reached up with my hand and found the shiny object.  It was a zipper.  Just then I thought back to my wish.  I said that I wanted to be able to switch between bodies with ease.  Did the ring have its own interpretation of my wish?<br />
<br />
Naturally I had to find out the answer.  I tried to pull the zipper down to the back of my head but it did not budge.  I then pulled it towards the front of my head.  It moved in this direction.  Slowly and carefully I pulled it closer to my forehead.  I could hear the faint sounds of a zipper being unzipped, like a jacket being unzipped.  Just as the zipper was at the top of my forehead, I could see different colored hair on the top of my head.  My hair was a light brown, but now I could see thick, jet black strands.  That was my favorite hair color for a female, so it seemed my wish was coming true.<br />
<br />
I pulled the zipper down my forehead and onto the bridge of my nose.  As I slid the zipper down my nose, my vision became blurry.  I moved the zipper over my nose and onto my mouth.  Now I had some trouble breathing.  I panicked slightly and moved the zipper faster so that it went down to my chin and onto my neck and throat.  I stopped the zipper at the top of my chest.  I reached up to the top of my head and found the spot where the black hairs began.  I found the ends of my brown hair and pulled them apart from each other.  More black hair spewed forth from the ever widening partition.  I pulled the rest of myself apart to separate my face since I now found that I could not move my mouth or breathe easily.  <br />
<br />
My vision came back into focus and I could breathe with ease again.  I immediately focused on the mirror.  I gasped at the sight.  My voice sounded higher pitched already.  The reflection in the mirror was incredible.  I had the face of a beautiful woman.  I ran my hands over my face to make sure everything felt real.  I had high cheekbones and a perfectly shaped jaw line.  My lips were full and had a deep red tone.  My nose was small and pert.  My eyes had long lashes and were now a soft green instead of blue.  “Oh, wow,” I whispered.  My voice sounded sultry.  <br />
<br />
I looked at the rest of my male body with my new female head atop of it.  It truly looked bizarre, especially with the pieces of my male head drooping off my shoulders.  I found the zipper and moved it down my chest in anticipation of seeing the rest of me.  I pulled it all the way down to my waist line and stopped again.  With eager anticipation I clutched the two ends of my male body in the middle of my chest.  As thoughts of Clark Kent opening his shirt to reveal his Superman costume ran through my head, I tugged open the skin and out popped two magnificent breasts.  I had to struggle a bit to maneuver the rest of my male body off my shoulders.  When I was successful in doing this, I carefully lifted each arm out of my male skin, which then dropped down so that the head hung low and almost touched the floor.  I admired my arms and hands.  They were smaller and thinner, but my arms also appeared well toned.  I had long, delicate fingers with nails that grew out slightly over the tips.<br />
<br />
I had to admire my breasts.  They were perfectly rounded and jutted proudly from my chest.  I cupped them in my female hands.  They were also firm.  I squeezed my nipples between my fingers which sent a jolt through me.  My nipples were very sensitive to the touch.  I could not help but squeeze them a few more times.  Eventually I got a hold of myself.  I ran my hands over my breasts and wondered how big they were.  Then I remembered I could find out right away.  I wished that I knew.  But nothing happened.  The information didn’t come to me.  I looked at my hand and noticed that the ring wasn’t there.  I looked down at my male hand and amazingly, even though it was now nothing but loose skin, the ring was still around my empty finger.<br />
<br />
In my present condition I could not reach down to pick it up.  So I found the zipper again and moved it down from my waistline.  It went directly through my cock and my testicles, which produced a rather odd feeling.  The zipper did not go any further than this spot.  So I continued to push the male skin of my female body.  I slid the loose skin over my wider hips and larger ass.  My cock and testicles pulled apart and revealed my pussy.  A neatly trimmed patch of triangle shaped pubic hair rested above it.  As carefully as I could I lifted my legs out of the male skin.  I was now completely free of the ugly male husk.  Before I did anything else I reached down and took the ring of the finger of my male body.  I placed it upon my female finger.  Just as it had when the old women first put it on me, the ring changed size to perfectly fit my female finger.  I immediately wished to know my breast size and knew that it was 36DD.<br />
<br />
I ran my hands all over my new body.  My skin was soft and smooth everywhere.  I ran my hands over my ass and loved how it felt soft, yet firm at the same time.  I had a perfect hourglass figure.  I could not see any signs of blemish on my skin anywhere.  I noticed that I my hair hung down to the tops of my breasts.  I looked at myself in the mirror and made several poses as if I was being photographed.  I had to say that I was pretty hot.  This was exactly what I wanted.  Now that I had it, what to do?</p>
