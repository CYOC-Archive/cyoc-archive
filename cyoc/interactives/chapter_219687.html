<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Kyle gone, she was now Hana till noon. Since the clock was just stricking nine, she had fifteen hours as a girl. Hana&#39;s note told her to have fun and learn to not be such a wallflower, but that didn&#39;t mean she suddenly knew how to socialize. <br />
<br />
However, that turned out to be not a huge problem. Several people approached her; friends of Hana asking about the trick, curious party goers wanting to know how it felt before using the zipper themselves, and a few flirts curious to see if she was up to experiment. <br />
<br />
More then a few guys liked what they had saw and was hoping Terry would be willing to cut loose as Hana. While she may be a girl now, she wasn&#39;t quite ready to experiment with guys. However, a tingling from her new equipment told her she was in the mood to experiment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hana&quot;, as she reminded herself she was now, was cornered by a couple. It seemed the girlfriend wanted to try some roll reversal for the night. She had convinced her best friend, who was drop dead gorgeous, to let her boyfriend to wear her.<br />
<br />
She had also convinced his best friend to let himself be worn by her so she could be the boyfriend. The one issue was the boyfriend himself had some reservations. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Hana told him. &quot;I don&#39;t know how my cousin does half this crap. He didn&#39;t even tell me how tonight&#39;s magic works. He got me in this body via peer-pressure. I can tell you, he wouldn&#39;t do anything that wasn&#39;t safe. Even if it doesn&#39;t appear that way.&quot; She paused and stared off into the distance. &quot;Even the Halloween thing. Everyone came out alive despite what it looked like.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girlfriend in question seemed confused but her boyfriend shivered. He had been there. &quot;So what you mean...&quot; his girlfriend said getting them back on track. &quot;...is that Mr. Big and strong here has nothing to fear and his dick will be back tomorrow at noon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little later depending on how long it takes Chad to unzip everyone.&quot; Hana corrected. &quot;But it will be fine.&quot; With that, the man was led off by his girlfriend and friends to where Chad was zipping people. Looking around Hana noticed the house seemed emptier. Chad had clearly been busy.<br />
<br />
A girl approached her. At 5&#39;9 she would have been shorter than Terry, but as Hana this girl was now taller. She wore a large knit beanie on her head, with dirty blonde hair cascading from under it going down her shoulders. She had on a crop top and cargo jeans. She smiled at Hana as she walked up. &quot;Well, I see little miss popular is done doing zipping consultations. I was wondering how you felt like getting a drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana glanced at her breasts real quick. She was on the small size so probably not Kyle. &quot;Before I answer, are you someone I know right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed. &quot;No, my body is one hundred percent natural right now. That might change if you turn me down though. A guy wanted to put me on, and if I don&#39;t get a date I might as well let him have a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana waved her hands. &quot;I&#39;m interested. I just wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t someone playing a prank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No prank, just trying to pick up a cute girl for the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a twinge in her stomach when she heard that. &quot;That&#39;s good, because I am a cute girl for the night. I&#39;m Hana.&quot; She paused. &quot;At least now I am. I&#39;m supposed to use my body&#39;s name. Usually I&#39;m Terry.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl giggled at the awkwardness pouring from Hana&#39;s mouth. &quot;I saw. You were quite cute, but I like this form as well.&quot; She looked Hana up and down, eyes locking on her breasts. &quot;I&#39;m Erin.&quot; She held out her arm. &quot;Shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana lopped her arm in Erin&#39;s. &quot;Oh, we are going together? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First rule for being a girl. Always see the bartender pour the drink when you get a drink from them. It could be dangerous otherwise.&quot; Walking was awkward as she wasn&#39;t use to the breeze of her skirt, and the thong flossing her cheeks left her feeling naked in the back. Hana hoped the uncomfortablness she felt didn&#39;t transfer into her walk. As they walked towards the bar, Erin suddenly turned to a guy they passed. &quot;Sorry, she said yes. You&#39;re gonna have to find a different body.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy seemed disappointed but walked off. They sat at the bar, had a drink and talked and laughed. It turned out that they had multiple interests in common, and it didn&#39;t hurt that Erin was smart and funny on top of being flirty and sexy.<br />
<br />
Finally, Erin asked about the real Hana. &quot;So she didn&#39;t tell you that she was going to let you wear her tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana shook her head. &quot;She and Chad kept it a secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is so weird. Everyone else is discussing it and talking about boundaries and they just throw you in a body without warning. What would they had done if you walked off the stage?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana shrugged. &quot;Who knows, but Chad is good at coercing people. He&#39;s nice about, like a stage magician telling the audience to give a reluctant volunteer some encouragement. Though it doesn&#39;t change that he&#39;s hard to say no to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s not like you have an agreed on code of conduct. What are you supposed to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana held up the letter, which she had kept in her purse that had been handed to her. She found the lack if pockets frustrating. &quot;I have this from the real Hana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin took the letter and read it. As she did she smirked. &quot;She sounds like a real good friend.&quot; She pointed at a line towards the bottom. &quot;She said to give her the dirty details. Want to make some dirty details to give her?&quot;<br />
<br />
A blush rose on Hana&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Uh...yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin leaned in and kissed her, slipping her tongue into her mouth. Hana felt the taller girl&#39;s arms wrap around her, one grasping her ass. Hana let herself be guided up the stairs and into one of the guest rooms in Chad&#39;s parents large house that was often used at the parties for hook ups. At least she heard people did that. Hana had never been invited as Terry. <br />
<br />
Their hands explored each other bodies as they quickly strip one another. Hana wasn&#39;t sure, but she thought some of her eagerness came from the alcohol. She seemed to not have as great as alcohol tolerance and any reservations she had that had been muted by its effects.<br />
<br />
Hana found herself on the bed, wearing only her panties. Erin leaned above her, topless but still wearing her pants. Her fingers plucked at the hem of Hana&#39;s underwear. &quot;Are you ready for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
When Hana nodded, she felt Erin&#39;s hand slide into her underwear. Hana marveled at the wetness she felt that replaced the usual feelings of attraction. She gasped as a finger slid into her. The sensation was alien and pleasurable. <br />
<br />
Erin continued to work on Hana below, while her other hand played with one nipple and her mouth the other. It wasn&#39;t long before Hana was experiencing her first female orgasim. <br />
<br />
Erin removed her hand and watched the panting girl. &quot;So, I take it that you like it. Considering we are experimenting already, I was wondering how far you are willing to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana spoke between breaths. &quot;What....do....you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can continue as is. It is your turn to get me off. On the other hand, I could find a cute guy to try on and you can take a walk on the wild side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing what she was suggesting Hana&#39;s eyes grew wide. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
She held a finger up to her lips as if to shush her. Hana couldn&#39;t help but notice it was one of the fingers that was recently inside of her. &quot;I&#39;m fine with continuing as is, but if you let me try out being a guy tonight I promise to let you try out on me everything I&#39;m going to do to you once we are back in our own bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What all do you plan to do?&quot; Hana asked.<br />
<br />
Erin once again smirked. &quot;Depends. How far to you want to go. The kinkier we get tonight, the kinkier we can get later. Tit for tat you could say. So, what do you say? Want me to be a boy or a girl?</p>
