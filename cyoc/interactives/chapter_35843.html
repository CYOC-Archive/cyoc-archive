<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Colin watched from his prison inside the transformation chamber, the wall behind Salmacis and the other shemales shimmered and changed. An image appeared on it of a group of people dressed in clothes worn by the upper class in Europe in the eighteenth century. Salmacis obviously had the power to conjure up images to help tell her story. <br />
Colin, the shemales and the people in cages awaiting transformation all listened as Salmacis used the images to tell the story of the Hellfire club.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, Gentlemen&quot;, a man in a formal suit raised his glass. &quot;A toast to the wonders of the Hellfire club. Tonight, we finally become more than a group of men and women, and of course the children dedicated to black magic&quot;, he gestured at some children also in the room. &quot;Tonight we shall finally cross the threshold. We shall perform not a sacrifice, not a chant of our coven. No tonight, we shall see an act of true magic. Tonight, the miracle of transformation, thanks to our new familiar demon, Salmacis&quot;<br />
<br />
The image froze as though the pause button had been pressed. &quot;Of course I'm not a demon&quot;, Salmacis explained. &quot;That silly mortal, was Sir Francis Dashwood and he had to involve the Devil in everything. However, he had traveled to Greece to find me. He had awaked me from the slumber of the gods and brought we back to England.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the shemales raised her hand like a child in school asking a question. &quot;What year was this mighty Salmacis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm an immortal, I don't pay much attention to time. Someone mentioned a date at one of those meetings. He said it was 1755. Does that mean anything in a human calendar? In any case, Dashwood wanted to show the club that he could involve more magic than simply chanting words or sacrificing people or animals. He wanted to perform a real magical spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pictures on the wall came back to life. The Hellfire club's meeting continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;First we need a subject for our magic. Bring in the villager&quot;, Dashwood shouted to somebody out of the scene.<br />
<br />
Four men carried in a wooden frame with handles rather like some sort of stretcher. However, there were chains built into it and on the stretcher was a naked young man He was chained hand and foot to the stretcher. The chains kept him in a position as though he was crawling on his hands and knees. As soon as the stretcher was placed on the ground in the center on a pentagram drawn there, one of the children leapt on his back as if to ride him like a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abigail, that man is here to be transformed, not ridden like a horse&quot;, one of the adults scolded. The girl got off the villager. <br />
<br />
The scene was like something out of a hammer horror movie, a large pentagram on the floor, the members of the Hellfire club. The villager looked terrified. He spoke like a stereotypical village yokel, &quot;Merciful Heavens, save me. Please, let me go good sir.&quot; Colin hadn't thought anybody actually spoke like that except in bad movies. It would seem however, that once upon a time that was exactly how people spoke.<br />
<br />
The villager pleaded with one of the women standing there. &quot;For the love of God, Madam, help me. Save me from these terrible people&quot;. The woman laughed in response. Dashwood reached into a pocket in his fancy coat. He pulled out a ring, which he held in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Behold, members of the hellfire club, the ring of Salmacis. And now I shall show you it's great power&quot;, Dashwood shouted. The ring was clearly not meant to be worn on a finger. It was far too large, about the size of a wrist bracelet. Dashwood stripped off his clothes and placed the ring around his penis. His penis was already erect as his put it on, but it began to grow larger and larger as soon as the ring was around it. Soon his penis was far too large for any mortal man. The only penises Colin had ever seen that size were on shemales. &quot;Yes, yes, I feel the power!&quot;, Dashwood cried out as his penis grew. <br />
<br />
The prisoner chained on his hands and knees seemed to guess what would happen next and screamed in terror. His fears were realized when Dashwood rammed his now massive penis deep inside his ass. &quot;Now feel the power of transformation&quot;, Dashwood yelled through clenched teeth. <br />
<br />
The prisoner's body began to change as soon as Dashwood's penis was inside him. The man's body shape changed becoming curvy and feminine. His hips grew wide and his butt larger and larger. &quot;That's it, become a woman&quot;, Dashwood roared. The prisoner's hair was growing longer and longer, his face and voice now that of a beautiful woman. His balls had retracted and gone inside his body and the lips of a woman's sex appeared between his legs. His penis however remained and had grown erect during his transformation. <br />
<br />
Dashwood pushed his penis deep inside the man he was transforming. &quot;And now, become a woman&quot;, Dashwood said as he came inside the man's ass. The prisoner cried out as his chest swelled, breasts growing rapidly out of his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Francis&quot;, a woman in the audience said as Francis Dashwood pulled his member out of the prisoner. &quot;You spell doesn't quite seemed to have turned him into the busty wench you wanted.&quot; She pointed at the prisoner's erect penis, the only sign left that he had ever been a man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed&quot;, Dashwood concurred. &quot;It seems I have created a half man, half woman. Perhaps we have a sheman or a manwoman. What should we call this abomination?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dashwood took the ring off his penis, which began to return to normal size. Unfortunately, as soon as the ring was off Dashwood's penis, the entire spell dissolved. The prisoner's breasts shrank, his body changed shape becoming male again. His balls returned until he was no different than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;A most impressive display of magic!&quot; a man called out from the audience. The whole crowd raised their wine glasses in a toast to Dashwood and applauded.<br />
<br />
The image on the wall of the transformation center faded. Salmacis finished her story. &quot;He was but an early experiment my children. As you can see the effects did not last long enough for our great work to begin. I gave that ring to Dashwood in the hope he would start the transformation of the world that we now strive to complete. It was however, not powerful enough for that purpose. I have been studying magic since those days and have now created new rings of Salmacis. Now shemale power shall know no limits. The entire world shall know the glory of shemale transformation. Salmacis held up a leather pouch. &quot;These contain rings that shall give all of you and those you transform greater powers than ever. All shall become shemales.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail great Salmacis&quot;, the shemales shouted in chorus. <br />
<br />
&quot;My children&quot;, Salmacis leant closer to the shemales gather around her. &quot;I could give you these rings now, but you have put such work into building these machines to transform those who do not yet know the greatness of our power. It would be a shame not to see them at work. Could I ask a favor of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh course you may mighty Salmacis&quot;, said the lead shemale.<br />
<br />
Salmacis gestured towards the transformation chamber with Colin still inside. &quot;I would love to see your machines in action. Show me how you would transform this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shemales ran over to the transformation chamber and put the power cones on their penises. The youngest shemale started the controls that would operate the machine. &quot;Let's show Salmacis what we can do&quot;, she said. &quot;Start emitting transformation power. For the first stage of the transformation&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin looked out of the transformation chamber. All the shemales were facing him, blue light ran down the wires coming out of the power cones over their penises and ran into the transformation machine. The shemales all had looks of intense concentration as they emitted transformation power out of their penises.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it shemales&quot;, the littlest shemale said as she operated the control panel. &quot;As much power as you can muster. Let's turn him into a woman&quot;. <br />
<br />
The chamber began to glow blue and a hum began to rise as the machine built up power</p>
