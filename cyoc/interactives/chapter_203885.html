<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin tried slipping the toga sheet back over his body but the slick wetness, along with the stains he could no longer make, encouraged him to discard it on an empty section of the counter. He told himself that he didn’t get rid of it because of the presence and aroma of drying spooge. Rather, he outlined his reasoning that it provided him with a better look at the near female he’d been given total control of. <br />
<br />
He turned with his hip bent and his hands playing across the soft, small mounds at his chest. It was his own private show. And this girl did exactly what he wanted, no questions asked. She wasn’t the sexiest girl he’d ever seen. That was reserved for a busty bitch at the market many months ago. He found reasons to follow her for several aisles. <br />
<br />
Eventually, she got suspicious and he conjured up the excuse that he was sure she’d visited his medical office once and he wanted to make sure she was healthy. She didn’t have a whole lot going on upstairs, so she soon flashed a smile and wondered if he could give her a quick examination. He knew bitches always got wet for doctors. But not this time, as she soon rebuffed his hints and strutted on her way. <br />
<br />
She couldn’t be the spurned chick who was holding him hostage, could she? The voice was too different. So, what were the letters again? AEIL? Did Celia fit? He could at least rule out the possibility. Maybe Alice.<br />
<br />
Only problem, no girls he ever had contact with shared those names. He flirted with an Alice once, but she also somehow resisted his charms. Maybe it was someone in the medical department who felt he had wronged them with a pay cut or being passed over for a position or not given enough attention. He honestly had no idea how the minds of women worked sometimes. <br />
<br />
If nothing else came of all this, he at least felt casually optimistic that perhaps he could pick up a few bedroom tricks. But that would also require filling in the blank between his legs. Till then, he alternated between rough and tender massages of his supple chest. It felt incomplete, like a transmitter without a receiver. No amount of diddling his pee hole helped. <br />
<br />
Grumbling and doing a little more posing to try to glean something out of this pitiful experience, he leaned over the slightly soiled bedsheet and lingered on a wet patch that still held a trace of fresh semen. His thoughts bolted ahead of his consciousness as he imagined a cumshot playfully decorating his hard nipples as he rubbed it into his skin, getting some on a delicate finger and then raising that…<br />
<br />
Fuck! He slapped his hands on the counter in a way that immediately hurt and he regretted, but it shook that line of thinking out of his brain. That bitch! This had to be her doing. He felt weird before, but the signs were piling up. There had to be a psychological, mind-altering aspect to all this, he surmised. Not only was she making him into a horny little bitch, but she was also turning him into a cocksucker too. <br />
<br />
Not that having a pretty doll like this…do that… didn’t excite him on some level, but he didn’t wanna be in the driver’s seat. He wanted be the one decorating her little tits with a pearl necklace. At the same time, he barely escaped contemplating how that would feel. <br />
<br />
Walking over to the safe to try out combinations left him with a subtle but inescapable girlish strut. The absence between his thighs was the most surreal and alarming. The slight jiggle at his chest was another distraction that nearly made him collide with the table. <br />
<br />
Crouching over the safe, he input every five letter possibility that he could dig out of his brain for women’s names, even some that sounded androgynous. After about thirty error beeps without success, the frustration made him slam the cabinet door closed. <br />
<br />
The sliver of a woman reflecting in the mirror across the room entranced him for a while. She pouted and gazed saucily over the fringe of her red hair with her tongue about to lick the glass. Cupping her bust, as though there were more to grasp than actually existed, sent an uncomfortable shiver through Justin‘s soft body. It might be fun to play with a slightly bigger set, but he didn’t actually want them to grow. Right…?, he asked himself in the silence of the room. There was no answer.<br />
<br />
Returning to the bathroom, he wielded the lamp like the most awkward tongs to shift over what was left in the shower and scoop them across the threshold to place in the corner. While those immediate dangers were set aside, he felt alarm when his hand trailed towards the untouched bottle of body soap. He was so close… If that object was actually planted. Just one touch and he’d be the only man who knew both sides. That was a better way to think of it. The potential greatest lover who knew all the intimate, pleasurable secrets. Just learn the tricks and get his full body back. <br />
<br />
Before he could scream at himself, his hand landed on the body soap. Nothing happened. Touching the shampoo bottle resulted in the same. At least that taught him that tainted objects seemed to be one and done. Grumbling, he restored all the shower products to their place and resumed washing.<br />
<br />
It still felt nice in there, even with the lather foaming over foreign flesh and teasing some sensitive zones. He could really go for a video of all this. And a towel, once he stepped out. Peeking in the drawers, he found but avoided a bottle of perfume spray. That would be far too obvious. Pulling open the main door, he stretched a hand to grab a large hairdryer. Now that would help. <br />
<br />
But before he could plug it in or do anything else, he felt tingles invade his body again. Oh shit, this was it. He didn’t throw the dryer or scream and curse. Rather, he carefully set it down and prepared himself.<br />
<br />
This time, the process seemed coy. It didn’t immediately give him what he was expecting. Rather, it settled in his already wide hips and tickled the bone into unfurling even more. When the tingling abated there, he had genuinely broad, curvy hips which spread in stark relief to his narrow waist, especially when it pinched in even more. <br />
<br />
Walking without a feminine sway became impossible. He would just have to deal. The following alterations seemed especially incremental. His fingers became a little more delicate with girlish wrists and perfect nails. His skin, despite the dense squishy accents, felt paper thin and fragile. Whatever muscles that may have insulated or protected him were gone, reduced to the basic model. Even grabbing the edge of the counter in his hands was enough to make him jolt. He felt so frail. <br />
<br />
When the tingles slipped around his entire body, the mirror, which once ended too low to show his entire head, now had plenty of room, even on his tiptoes. Small, sensitive, delicate. He still seemed to have a few inches on most woman in height, but the gap was swiftly closing.<br />
<br />
His face didn’t need any help to look like a ladies. Even his full, but soft eyebrows weren’t helping and those plump lips appeared even sexier. He hadn’t even sensed his Adam’s apple for a good while, but no finessing of his voice managed to make him sound like anything but a woman when the tingles looked for their next target. After spreading out his brilliant red hair, the transformation dove for his nethers. Drawing in a tight breath, he felt shaky.<br />
<br />
No fucking way he was actually wanted this but it would be something unique to intimately know what it felt like. To be the first to cross that boundary. Till that moment, his ass gained a pronounced jiggle which didn’t take it to the realm of bubble butts or anything Instagram worthy but definitely added a sloped, emphatic shape. It was manageable, but one with enough real estate deserve a good smack or pinch. That’s definitely what he would do. <br />
<br />
Before the coup de grace, it teased him with a detour to his chest. The little bumps with great ambition swelled with clear, rounded mass on each side. The weight nudged at his shoulders and collarbone. He had no illusions that the subtle domes could be anything but breasts. For emphasis, the nipples spread out in a colorful, distinct shape. Ringed skin with subtle bumps led away from his chest and announced themselves. And they kept going, until they left behind any doubt they were more than a set of Madonna cones, until the mounds were enough to fill his fingers, until he started to worry. But they didn’t stopped. <br />
<br />
They had enough to dangle in a defined shape resting on his chest. They had enough to almost show off. And they were more than Justin could ever imagine occupying his chest. But they didn’t distract him from the final rush of warmth between his thighs. <br />
<br />
The climax came as a relief and a release. What was naked and shapeless, took on familiar contours. The flesh between his thighs split and a chasm, excited with possibilities, divided his entire being. The restrained energy behind the doll feeling pulsed through his being. <br />
<br />
The return of what once had been his penis, but in an even tinier and sharply concentrated shape, felt like a floodlight of sensation in his face. Everything felt deep beneath but also alarmingly exposed between his legs, yet compact and tight with layers of sensitive skin seeking to spread and swell. Some of it felt faintly familiar in a human sense, but other parts were beyond alien. <br />
<br />
His brain barely seemed ready to process the flood as every shift of his girlish thighs brought a reaction he’d never felt before. But beyond the simple yet mind-boggling sensations was a drumbeat of desire and need he’d never considered. He wanted to get fucked and hard. <br />
<br />
The tatters of his masculine ego were unprepared to mount a defense against this notion. He wanted to get wet, he wanted to spread his legs wide and feel a hard hot cock slide inside his being, deep, as far as it could go. Feel what those women he fucked for hours and long weekends knew intimately, what drove them to insatiable need. And he didn’t even care if there was an excuse of learning behind that. He just wanted it. <br />
<br />
This feral, animalistic desire spilling over rational thought slowly eased when the voice chimed in, “Welcome to the girl’s side… Hmmm. The name Justin just doesn’t seem appropriate anymore. What shall I call you? How about Ruby, for those luscious locks? Don’t worry, I won’t force a new name on you. Just brainstorming. I’ll leave your new name to you when we’re done… And we’re almost there. I know you can see the letter C in my name. That should help a lot. Although I’m willing to bet you have a few things you want to try out before you unlock your escape. Don’t worry… I’m patient. Toodles, for now!”<br />
<br />
The voice was right, he had a lot to explore… She had a lot to explore.</p>
