<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on, Joe. Wake up&quot; you hear a female voice say coaxingly. &quot;Wakey wakey!&quot; You feel very strange, and blink a little, blearily opening your eyes. What the hell is going on? Your head hurts, and you moan. Moving your eyes around, you open and close them a few times, trying to focus on the world. The face of Val, an almost unholy expression of mixed joy and satisfaction on it, is the first thing you recognise. After a moment you realise that the room you're in seems familiar, but you can't work out why you're there.<br />
<br />
It looked like the large greenhouse at the back of Val's house, which you'd been in a few times. The temperature was fairly high and it was a bit humid. You look around slowly, seeing large glass panes all around you, the roof having some open windows to allow air in. It's definitely the greenhouse, you can see a large rubber plant you got her when you were still dating, before you found out how unstable she was. The glass walls of the large room are opaque up to about eight feet off the ground, but the roof is transparent. What are you doing there? The last thing you remember is...<br />
<br />
Oh. <br />
<br />
Shit.<br />
<br />
Without looking you suddenly realise you still have the huge wobbling breasts Val had accidentally given you. Every little movement makes them roll around on your chest, gently brushing against each other. Your eyes widen slightly and Val smiles. &quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; you ask. Or try to. What comes out is a muffled noise only barely recognisable as speech, and weirdly it's accompanied by a burst of pleasure. Val grins widely, and steps aside revealing a large mirror. You stare at it, horror making your mind go blank for a moment.<br />
<br />
The figure reflected there bears little resemblance to what you remember. She has been busy. You looks at it and a small whimper escapes your lips.<br />
<br />
Lips that aren't on a mouth. No, what is on your face is easily recognisable, but not something that belongs in the position it occupies. You have difficulty coming to terms with the fact that you now have a perfectly normal appearing vagina in place of where your mouth and nose was when you woke up that morning. It extends from your chin to half-way up where your nose was. You try opening your mouth and the vagina gapes a little, but you don't have much control over it. Swallowing, you go slightly cross-eyed from the unexpected erotic pleasure that results. That isn't the extent of the changes either. Not by a long way.<br />
<br />
You can see that your eyes are now those of a cat, for some reason. On the sides of your head sprout large furry ears, that you decide must be from something like a deer, sticking up and out, twitching around to every sound. You find you have little control over them. Your face is otherwise unchanged, although your hair has been replaced with brilliant blue feathers. These form the shape of a very feminine looking sort of pageboy haircut, coming down the sides of your head to your jawline, and forming a fringe across your forehead.<br />
<br />
From the neck down it gets even weirder. You still have the breasts, which if anything have grown, but they have been joined by another pair just as large. Your nipples are rigidly erect and inhuman in size, sticking out like a pair of sausages two or three inches. Your torso is extremely feminine in shape, tapering into a very narrow waist then flaring out into wide hips. <br />
<br />
Below those hips your former legs are gone, fused together into a single limb that while it follows the shape of a pair of long sexy female legs, is anything but. In fact, it is the tail of a large fish, narrowing to about the diameter of one of your former ankles, before flaring out into wide flukes that stretch out over a distance of a good two feet, ribs holding the delicate membrane out in a classic fishtail shape. Small fins stick out on either side, just below your waist, and between then is another vagina, in roughly the position that it would occupy on a normal human.<br />
<br />
Your entire body is covered in small glinting scales, which look more like snakeskin than fish scales. They range in colour from a deep red, almost purple at your tailfin, smoothly fading away to a light blue at your waist, then becoming smaller and finer in texture on your torso, shading to a very light green across it. Your arms are held out to the sides, bent at the elbows into an L shape putting your hands above your head, and you try moving them. They move easily and you bring your hands up in front of your face to see if what you saw in the mirror is real.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, instead of normal hands, you now have a pair of foot-long penis-like structures there sprouting up from your wrists. They are rigidly erect, and when you touch one with the other instead of firm flesh they click together with a sound like plastic on plastic. Somehow she has managed to make you for all intents and purposes have a pair of dildos terminating your arms. To add insult to injury, they're slightly translucent and bright shocking pink. You notice that about where the top of your wrist should be is a small v-shaped structure sticking out, which you realise is some sort of clitoral stimulator. The change glove is now a wristband around your right arm.<br />
<br />
When you take your attention off your hands your arms extend out to the sides again and bend up without you intending it, it seems to be your default position. Val is grinning at you manically.&quot;You wouldn't believe how much trouble it was trying to work out the commands to give you those&quot;, she said happily. &quot;I hope you appreciate the effort.” You try to shout at her but only manage to arouse your mouth-vagina. She smiles.<br />
<br />
You look at the mirror again, and she helpfully moves it around to the side so you can see the rest of your new freakish self. Your eyes widen even more. Your multi-breasted mermaid-like body is suspended a foot off the floor by a branch-like limb that emerges from the middle of your back between your shoulderblades and swoops up then down again in a graceful curve to merge with a large plant that is firmly rooted in the middle of the greenhouse floor. You are hanging about three feet from the trunk of the plant. It has a number of large leaves growing from it a little like a palm tree, and tops out at about seven feet tall. Several large flowers, bright blue in colour, grow from the top of the plant, sprouting from between the leaves on long stems.<br />
<br />
With the side view you can see that you have a sort of dorsal fin below the stem growing from your back, running about eighteen inches down over your rear and along your tail. It looks more like a large leaf, an impression reinforced by the flowers, like the ones growing from the plant but smaller, that sprout from it at intervals of a couple of inches.<br />
<br />
“It's part of you”, she comments, walking over to the plant and running her hands along the foot-thick trunk. You make a muffled noise as you find you can feel the touch of her hand. She reached up and tickles on of the flowers and you squirm as a massive erotic wave goes through you. They are extremely sensitive. She smiles again. “When the bees find you you should have a lot of fun.” Walking back around to your front, she moves the mirror out of the way. You suddenly reach for her, but she was expecting that. She grabs your arms and pulls down hard, then lets go.<br />
<br />
The stem suspending you in the air flexes down sharply, and your tailfin nearly touches the ground. When she lets go your dangling body bounces up and down frantically, the stem is obviously very springy. You bounce up and down helplessly, feeling your huge breasts flop around massively, unable to control them. Trying to support them at least with your dildo-hands you find with a shock that suddenly you can no longer move them, they stay fixed rigidly in position. She laughs.<br />
<br />
“As long as you are moving more than a small amount, your arms don't have any conscious control.” She stepped back a bit and smiled nastily. “But they have unconscious control! Command: Right arm, mouth. Vibrate on.” Without any action on your part, your right arm slowly moves, the living dildo tipping it aiming at your vagina-mouth. The little stimulator on the end of it begins to vibrate wildly making a humming sound, and the rest of it pulses at a lower frequency. Frantically you try to stop it, but to no avail. It eases closer and the tip slowly pushes it's way between the lips of the misplaced pussy. As it enters your throat you find yourself forced to tip you head back to allow it to go in. Eventually it is pushed fully home, and the buzzing growth on the top of it is sitting either side of the clitoris that is roughly where your nose was.<br />
<br />
The sensations are overwhelming, and you make a choked cry as your body shivers all over. Your mermaid's tail twitches from side to side, sinuously flexing along its length, the movements keeping you bouncing up and down on your stem. You orgasm for the first time from your facial pussy, and feel liquid start dripping from all four nipples and running down your chest and along your tail, finally dripping off the end of it. Val laughs, and sits down to watch.<br />
<br />
“We're going to have so much fun! I have lots of ideas of things to change you into. But you're going to have to get used to being rooted in place for a while, I don't want you thinking you can get away.” She watched for a while longer as you had another orgasm. You can barely concentrate on the sound of her voice, the sensations coming from your body are too intense. <br />
<br />
“I did some research on the web. You wouldn't believe the things you can find on Google! I managed to find some more instructions for that glove, and would you believe it? You can set a password, so random people won't mess up the changes. I don't know why the instructions that came with it didn't mention that. Anyway, I locked it, so the only person who can make changes is me. Even if you do one day manage to escape, you'll be stuck. And I have no intention of letting you be a normal human for a very long time.” She stood up.<br />
<br />
“I'm going to get something to eat. Command: Vibrate off.” The rumbling and buzzing stopped, and you slumped in relief, as much as you could while hanging there. Your right dildo was still pushed to the hilt into your pussy-mouth, but at least the sensations were dying down. “When I've had supper I'll come and water you. Don't go anywhere!”<br />
<br />
A few minutes later you hear another buzzing sound, this one coming from somewhere else in the greenhouse. You can move your left arm now as the bouncing of your stem has died down to a slight swaying, but your right one still have it's dildo pushed firmly into your former mouth and down your throat, and you can't remove it. A few seconds later you let out a muffled yell as an enormously sexual thrill goes through you from somewhere behind you, and you realise the bees have found your flowers...</p>
