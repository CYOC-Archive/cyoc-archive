<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He took a deep breath and tried to calm his racing thoughts. &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he murmured, trying to ignore the pulsing in his chest. &quot;How do I do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin stared at the medallion, the stone gate with its spiral carving seemingly coming to life. He willed the power within to show itself, and almost immediately, he felt it stirring. Thin streams of light started to ooze out from the center of his chest, pulsing and moving with the rhythm of his heart. The room lit up more and more, and with each beat of his heart, the light grew stronger. His dick, which was now rock-hard, wasn&#39;t responding to any sexual urge, but rather to the sheer excitement of something huge that was about to happen. His body was shaking, not with fear, but with the incredible force of the energy rushing through him.<br />
<br />
Shifting his gaze to his kitchen, he pictured the tiny, cramped space as a canvas just waiting for a miraculous makeover. He murmured a single word, &quot;Transform,&quot; and the room around him began to change. The wallpaper peeled away, revealing shiny chrome underneath. The counters looked like they&#39;d been replaced with real marble, and his old fridge was now a fancy armoire floating exotic goodies. The floor went from dull linoleum to a snazzy black and white checkered pattern of tiles. The harsh fluorescent lights that used to buzz and flicker were now a soft, warm glow that seemed to be part of the walls themselves. It was like his whole kitchen had been plucked from a fairy tale and dropped into his apartment.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. The power of the medallion had done it—it had transformed his dull, cramped room into something incredible. It was more than a simple renovation; it was like he&#39;d claimed this space as his gateway to Krysalon. The tension in his chest eased a bit as the energy found a way out through the changes he&#39;d made. The room now reflected who he truly was, or at least who he was about to become. This was just the beginning of his journey into a world where magic was real.<br />
<br />
Kevin took a cautious step back and studied the kitchen, a mix of amazement and anxiety. The energy coursing through him was exhilarating, yet he understood he couldn&#39;t allow it to take the reins. It was essential for him to learn how to handle it, to harness it for positive purposes. The amulet nestled against his chest grew noticeably warmer, its metallic threads pulsing more rapidly.<br />
<br />
As he contemplated his next course of action, a knock at the door startled him. His heart gave a little jump. Who on earth could it be at this hour? He had only shared his discovery with Elwen, and she had just departed. Quickly, he threw a bedsheet around himself and rushed to the door.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, there on the porch was a young woman looking slightly frazzled. She had a concerned look on her face. &quot;Kevin?&quot; she called softly, her eyes searching through the narrow gap of the door. It was none other than Sally, his closest confidant since they were kids and the person he always turned to for guidance, even when things got as weird as they were right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Sally,&quot; Kevin said, trying to sound casual despite the panic in his voice. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of her head when she walked into the house. The living room and kitchen looked like they&#39;d been hit by a magic wand. Normally, it&#39;s all mess and dirt, but now it was like stepping into a fancy picture from a storybook. Everything looked so clean and pretty, it was weird. The walls were this cool blue-gray color that made them seem like they were glowing, and the archways looked like they were made of shiny silver. The floor was all fancy white stone with blue lines like someone had painted them with glitter. She looked around, trying to figure out what was going on. &quot;Kevin,&quot; she said, almost whispering, &quot;What the heck did you do?&quot; She couldn&#39;t believe how cozy it felt in a place she&#39;d never seen before.<br />
<br />
Kevin couldn&#39;t help but smile a little when he saw her shock. He&#39;d always wanted to pull off some amazing surprise, but this was way beyond what he&#39;d ever imagined. &quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; he said, still sounding a bit confused himself. He waved for her to sit on the sofa, which now looked like it should be in a castle instead of their regular old house. &quot;Take a seat, I&#39;ve got some serious &#39;splaining to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally carefully walked across the floor, looking around like she expected to wake up any moment. She sat down and said, &quot;Alright, what&#39;s going on here?&quot; She was trying to sound calm, but her voice was shaking a little from all the excitement.<br />
<br />
And just like that, Kevin tossed the toga aside like it was made of paper. It fell to the floor, and he felt his body come alive as the air touched his bare skin. He took a deep breath, feeling like he could do anything. &quot;Alright,&quot; he told himself, &quot;Time to tell her everything.&quot; His heart was racing, and he felt a weird buzz of energy all over like he&#39;d just jumped into an ice-cold pool on a hot day.<br />
<br />
But when Sally saw him, she didn&#39;t just gawk at his nakedness. Her eyes went even wider when she noticed the metal growing out of his chest, spreading over his body like a spiderweb. &quot;Kevin!&quot; she squeaked out, half scared and half in awe. &quot;What in the world happened to you?&quot; It was like she couldn&#39;t decide if she was more freaked out or amazed. The metal looked like it was alive, growing thicker and reaching further down his body like it was a part of him now.<br />
<br />
Kevin took a seat beside her, and his hand, which had a metal covering on it, lightly grazed her arm. The cool, yet oddly lifelike metal took her by surprise, making her jump. &quot;Whoa, sorry about that,&quot; he said, sounding a bit embarrassed. &quot;So, Sally,&quot; he began, taking a deep breath as if to calm his racing thoughts, &quot;I stumbled across this thing, right? It&#39;s a medallion. And get this, it&#39;s from some far-off place named Krysalon. And let me tell you, it&#39;s done some crazy stuff to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;made me a &#39;gateway&#39;. Then this power transformed a guard into an elf lady and then this&quot; he gestures to the two rooms. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next but I need to learn to control it before it gets out of hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man that makes my thing a cakewalk,&quot; Sally murmured, her eyes wide with shock. &quot;But you gotta keep it together, Kev.&quot; She took a deep breath, visibly trying to compose herself. Her voice was shaky, but she managed to sound more in control than Kevin felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;wait, why are you here?&quot; Kevin asked looking at her more closely. &quot;You&#39;re all... beat up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally&#39;s hand flew to her face, covering the bruises. &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;Me and Brad had a... a disagreement. He got a bit handsy, so I left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking closely his eyes widened at the strangulation marks around her neck. &quot;Sally, what did that piece of shit do to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes welled up with tears and she whispered, &quot;It&#39;s over. He... he&#39;s not going to hurt me anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin felt his anger surge, his new power pulsing in time with his heartbeat. &quot;You can stay here, Sal,&quot; he said gruffly, trying to keep his voice steady. &quot;But if he comes near you again...&quot; He didn&#39;t finish the threat, but the promise of retribution was clear in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Sally looked at him with a mix of gratitude and fear. The living room looked like something out of a fantasy movie, and she could feel the energy radiating from Kevin, a strange heat that washed over her as she stepped closer to him. She was still in shock, but the concern in his voice grounded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re okay,&quot; he said firmly, reaching out to touch her shoulder gently. The contact made his power flare again, and she felt the warmth spread through her. The bruises on her face began to fade, the marks on her neck vanishing as if erased by a magical hand. Sally gasped, looking up at him with wide eyes.<br />
-<br />
Sally felt the comforting warmth of Kevin&#39;s touch spreading throughout her body, a tender caress that had the power to ease her soul. The pain that Brad&#39;s harsh grip had caused disappeared instantly, allowing her to take a deep, relieving breath. But as she let it out, the sensation grew stronger and more intense, like it was enveloping her in a living, fiery embrace. She staggered, her eyes going wide as everything around her started to swirl into a dizzying whirlwind of silver light.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the changed living room, Kevin could only watch in utter amazement as Sally went through a transformation right before his eyes. Her body grew and filled out, her skin deepening to a rich, earthy brown. Her neck grew thicker, her head stretching and reshaping into a bull-like face, complete with a set of horns curling majestically from her forehead. Her hands and feet turned into hooves, her limbs lengthening and bulging with muscle, and fur began to sprout in random patches all over her body. Her clothes couldn&#39;t handle the shift and tore away, revealing a sculpted six-pack and broad, powerful shoulders. Her feminine features had been replaced by a powerful, half-human, half-bull form, with a dramatically narrowed waist that led to muscular, animal-like hips. The change was so intense and captivating that Kevin remained rooted to the spot, unable to tear his gaze away as Sally&#39;s human form gave way to the overwhelming power of the medallion.<br />
<br />
His voice grew deeper, a gruff baritone that seemed to resonate with a newfound confidence and strength. &quot;I am Tauros!&quot; he announced proudly, &quot;The Minotaur of the Crystal Labyrinth!&quot; His eyes gleamed with a fierce resolve that was almost unrecognizable in the face of the creature he had become. The transformation had been swift and shocking, leaving Sally&#39;s former self bare and disheveled before him. Now, a towering blend of myth and reality stood there, a creature that was both terrifying and awe-inspiring.<br />
<br />
Tauros, now a staggering seven feet tall, had a tail that was thick and powerful, swishing behind him like a warrior&#39;s cape. His fur, once a deep black, was now bathed in a soft light, and as it faded away, a new outfit appeared on his body. It was a simple leather loincloth, just enough to cover his massive genitals. His cock was a sight to behold, a good foot in length and thick as a beer can, leaving anyone to wonder how she could ever have hidden it in her human form. His balls were huge and heavy, dangling between his powerful legs with a weight that suggested a virility beyond human comprehension.<br />
<br />
Tauros glanced down at his transformed body, his head spinning with a weird mix of horror and curiosity. The weight of his new manhood swung with his every move, and the snug leather loincloth was putting a squeeze on his growing boner. Something in him just wanted to flex those muscles, to get a taste of the power now pumping through his veins. He&#39;d never felt this... this manly before. His brain was a mess, like someone had dumped out Sally&#39;s fear and the Minotaur&#39;s basic instincts all over the floor and he was trying to sort through it.<br />
<br />
Then, bam! The Minotaur&#39;s old memories started popping up like he was watching some highlight reel from his past life. He saw all those gladiator battles in Krysalon, heard the crowd going nuts, tasted the blood, and felt the highs and lows of winning and losing. He knew the score on fighting and screwing, living life like a beast of passion and all that jazz. But there was another side to it, something almost... human. He recalled Sally&#39;s sadness, and Brad being a real asshole. That rage inside him? It shot up like a rocket, his dick getting harder just thinking about it. He knew pain, knew what it was like to be treated like shit, and he also knew what it felt like to want to keep someone safe.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kevin was still changing up too. This medallion he had on was like a battery pack for power, getting stronger by the second. It was turning him into a superhuman, with these shiny platinum strings snaking around his limbs and body like a second skin. He could feel his head clearing up, his thoughts getting sharper, like he&#39;d just downed five espressos. He knew he was capable of more than just this, that he had to push it to the next level.<br />
<br />
And that claw finger of his? Fully metal now, looking like it was wearing some fancy silver armor. It was wild like he could feel the whispers of some ancient world coursing through him, egging him on to become this big deal, this channel for its comeback. It was as if he&#39;d been given a cheat code for a video game, but instead of playing games, he was living the real deal.<br />
<br />
Tauros inhaled deeply, his chest rising and falling dramatically. His nostrils widened as he sniffed the unfamiliar aromas that permeated the room. In a tone that was surprisingly Sally&#39;s despite its depth and roughness, he murmured, &quot;Kevin, I... I think this is kinda cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin stared at his friend, now a Minotaur, trying to process the sudden turn of events. &quot;You do?&quot;<br />
-Tauros nodded, his bull&#39;s head moving just a bit as he tested out his new arms. The leather loincloth around his waist tightened as he flexed them, and he could feel his cock and balls react to the movement, the weight of it all feeling foreign but somehow fitting. His fur was thick and plush, giving off a cozy vibe that seemed to fill the whole room. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he murmured, sounding a little amazed, &quot;I do. It&#39;s weird, but it&#39;s like this is how I&#39;ve always been. It&#39;s strange, but it feels natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin couldn&#39;t stop the pang of jealousy that shot through him. &quot;Wow, Tauros,&quot; he said, trying to get his head around the whole situation. &quot;I&#39;m happy for you, I guess. But, I gotta say, this wasn&#39;t what I ever had in mind for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros looked over at him, his blue eyes just as sharp in his new bovine face. &quot;Don&#39;t be sorry, man,&quot; he said, not even bothering to hide his excitement. &quot;This isn&#39;t on you. For real, I&#39;ve felt more like myself in the last few minutes than I ever have. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve been stuck in someone else&#39;s body, and now it&#39;s all clicking. I feel like a beast.&quot; He flexed his muscles again, making the leather of the loincloth protest with a faint sound. &quot;So strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin nodded, still trying to get used to the idea. &quot;I&#39;m just worried about that medallion,&quot; he admitted, &quot;What if I can&#39;t handle the power it&#39;s got?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros stopped in his tracks, glancing back at Kevin with a contemplative look. &quot;You know, it might not be about bossing it around,&quot; he said, his voice echoing in the room. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s more about getting it, you know? And if there&#39;s someone who can lend a hand with that, it&#39;s me.&quot; He gave his new horns a little tap with his shiny metal claws. &quot;I&#39;ve been there, done that, if you catch my drift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kevin cocked an eyebrow, his eyes lingering on Tauros&#39;s robust, furry physique and the leather loincloth that was barely holding in his newly-grown, rather large manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me put it this way,&quot; Tauros said, his eyes shimmering with the insight of someone who&#39;s seen it all. &quot;This place, Krysalon, it&#39;s not just popping up again because of you; it&#39;s becoming a piece of you. And if it can change me like this,&quot; he waved his hand over his body, &quot;then maybe it&#39;s got a message for you. The trick to handling this power might just be to welcome it, rather than pushing it away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin studied Tauros&#39;s transformed face, searching for any trace of the buddy he used to know. &quot;But what if it keeps changing me too much? What if I can&#39;t rein it in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man, check out your crib,&quot; Tauros said, pointing at Kevin&#39;s evolving living space. &quot;You&#39;re sitting on the starting point of a freaking mansion here. And you&#39;re sweating the small stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros moved closer, his bulky body surprisingly agile. &quot;Kevin,&quot; he rumbled his furry hand landing on Kevin&#39;s shoulder with a gentle touch of his claws, &quot;you&#39;re the Gatekeeper. You&#39;ve got a role to play. We&#39;re partners in this gig now.&quot; He held eye contact firmly. &quot;Let&#39;s just roll with it for now, and see where it takes us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin gave a nod, really taking in what his buddy was saying, and the comfort he got from the gentle pat on the back. &quot;Okay,&quot; he murmured, his voice quivering a bit. &quot;But, uh, what about Brad, man? What about your own life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros&#39; face went grim, and he practically spat out, &quot;Brad can go to hell as far as I&#39;m concerned. And my life? It&#39;s all yours now, Kev. Or... ours, I guess.&quot; His voice dropped a bit, and his eyes got this wild look in them. &quot;And if that asshole ever shows up again...&quot; He didn&#39;t finish that sentence, but the unspoken threat was clear as day.<br />
<br />
Feeling a bit on edge, Kevin decided to switch things up. &quot;Hey, too bad about the TV, right?&quot; he said, trying to lighten the mood. &quot;Would&#39;ve been cool to catch the game tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros was off in his world, playing with his new furry nip, which was just plain weird to see. &quot;Game?&quot; he said, looking up with a sly smile. &quot;How about us...&quot;<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, the mirror on the wall started to quiver and its surface began to distort like it was made of water. Before long, the game was playing out in front of them, as clear as day on a high-def TV. Tauros couldn&#39;t help but stop and gawk at it. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be,&quot; he murmured, his new, gruff voice filled with amazement.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;How the...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros let out a chuckle, the deep rumble echoing around the room. He flexed his brawny arms, still getting used to the idea of all this power. &quot;Looks like we&#39;re gonna have to get acquainted with some of the bonuses of being in this &#39;lost world&#39; of Krysalon,&quot; he said, casually playing with the fur on his chest. Every time his hand grazed over one of his new nipples, it was like a bolt of pleasure shot through him, making his whole body tremble. It was weird, but he liked it.<br />
<br />
His mind wandered to the last time he&#39;d seen a woman before he turned into... well, this. He&#39;d never really felt anything for them before, but now... Now that he had these new instincts, it was all different. He could feel his dick stirring at the thought. It was huge, even just hanging there. He had to admit, it was a bit intimidating. He wondered how it&#39;d feel to be with someone, to touch those soft curves, to taste...<br />
<br />
His hand wandered down, just playing with the fabric of his loincloth over his growing hard-on. It was so sensitive that even the lightest touch drove him wild. He could feel himself getting harder, his cock swelling under his palm. It had been so long since he&#39;d felt anything like this, and it was strange but exhilarating all at the same time.<br />
<br />
As they plopped down onto the sofa that had cost a fortune, the mirror on the wall showed the game they had been dying to watch. Tauros couldn&#39;t resist a low, happy growl as he sank into the soft cushions. The loincloth he had on barely covered his excitement; a little wet spot was growing at the tip of his rather large cock. Kevin couldn&#39;t help but feel a twinge of envy, watching his buddy get all cozy in that new body of his.<br />
<br />
The game was on, with the sound of the crowd going wild as if they were actually at the stadium. But they couldn&#39;t keep their eyes on the screen. The tension between them was thick enough to cut with a knife. Kevin&#39;s body felt weird like it was begging to do something.<br />
<br />
&quot;You cool with all this?&quot; Kevin finally asked, glancing at the wet spot spreading on Tauros&#39;s loincloth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I be?&quot; Tauros said, his voice all deep and gruff. He reached down to fix himself up, his hand brushing the fabric and giving him a little thrill. &quot;Look at me, I&#39;ve got a body that could put any Greek god to shame, and the power of a bull to boot. And check this out,&quot; he added, flexing those new muscles of his. His chest fur waved as he did like he was a buff hairy action figure.<br />
<br />
As the game unfolded on the mystical mirror, Tauros&#39;s thoughts wandered back to his previous life. It felt like watching a movie from afar, yet the emotions hit him like a tidal wave. He recalled his days in the gladiatorial games, the deafening applause, the overpowering scent of blood and sand. After gaining his freedom, he&#39;d been entrusted with an immense responsibility: to protect the Medallion of Krysalon. It was a duty of profound significance, serving as a beacon of hope that their world could be reborn through a selected individual. And that person, it turned out, was Kevin.<br />
<br />
The Minotaur felt a peculiar bond with the man he&#39;d been in that past life. The agony remained, the anger that had pushed him to endure in the arena, but now there was something extra. A fervent resolve to shield and aid, fueled by the power of the medallion now within him. He understood he needed to assist this new &#39;Gateway&#39;, to ensure Krysalon&#39;s survival, even if it meant sacrificing himself.<br />
<br />
He looked over at Kevin, who was still wandering around the room, lost in his tumultuous thoughts. The man seemed so... vulnerable, despite the shimmering silver that covered his chest. Tauros knew he had to be the rock, the guiding force for both of them, to navigate this chaos.<br />
-<br />
&quot;Kevin,&quot; the man&#39;s voice boomed, filling the space around them. &quot;You&#39;ve got to see this, it&#39;s bigger than you, man. This is about our whole world, the future we&#39;re gonna leave behind. It&#39;s about us now, you know?&quot; He motioned between them, highlighting their unexpected bond. &quot;We&#39;ve gotta put our heads together and figure out the next move.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin ceased his staring, turning his gaze to Tauros. His eyes scanned the creature&#39;s face, trying to find a glimpse of the buddy he&#39;d known. The Minotaur&#39;s eyes met his, filled with a determination so intense it felt like it could melt away all of Kevin&#39;s doubt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Kevin spoke up, sounding more decisive now. &quot;But first things first, we&#39;ve gotta get you some proper threads. That loincloth isn&#39;t gonna cut it, and you&#39;re gonna give the mail carrier a heart attack looking like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tauros couldn&#39;t resist a laugh, a low rumble that seemed to shake the very walls. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; he conceded, his thoughts racing with the thrill of what was to come. &quot;That might be a good starting point.&quot;<br />
-<br />
