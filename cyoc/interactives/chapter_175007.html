<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon, Ty reached the monkey house of the zoo. He had already someone in mind to become a monkey. Kai was a wild one, and was often told to stop monkeying around, so what would be more fitting? But maybe he should be nice for once. While Susan wasn´t happy with how wild Kai was sometimes, Ty knew she had a crush on him. So, he could help her get her partner, even if that meant devolving for her.<br />
„I wish that my class arrives here next, with Kai entering last, holding the door for everyone else, mostly for Susan, who will come in just before him. The moment they both are inside, they will lose their posture and move somewhat more carefree, altering between two feet and hands and feet together. They won´t take notice of this, as the other people around, beside me, will see two young monkeys instead of them, and their screeching can only be understood by them both and me. They will receive some pets and maybe a banana, accepting both, before being taken into their new enclosure, unable to hurt anyone or leave it ever again on their own. As soon as they both are inside their new home, they will slowly change into young monkeys in body, becoming part of the family inside, which will wait for them finishing their changes. Nobody will remember the humans called Kai and Susan but me after they are inside and I´m able to telepathically talk to them, sounding like their respective voice so they will think I´m their inner voice.”<br />
<br />
This time Ty had to wait a couple of minutes before the others arrived. Kai was one of the first to arrive at the door, and like Ty wished, held it open for everyone else. Susan had knelt down outside, tying her shoe, which resulted in her entering last before Kai himself. Seconds later, both Susan and Kai seemed to relax, dropping their shoulders lower, bend forward. Every few steps, their hands touched the ground, walking on all fours, before straightening up a bit, again walking on two. Both looked forward, walking side by side, so neither noticed their weird moving pattern.<br />
Reaching the right enclosure, the class watched the monkeys inside, until Susan moved a bit in front of one of them. “Huh?” came from the surprised student, before another said: “Look, two of the monkeys are outside with us.” Most of the class turned towards Susan, who herself looked around with interest, seeing no monkey. The only weird thing was Kai, bowed forward, with his hands touching the ground.<br />
Kai himself had turned towards the one who had commented there were monkeys with them, but found none. Susan had lowered herself a bit, hands down on her knees, but no monkey.<br />
Susan, still looking at Kai, asked: “Are you making fun of the monkeys, Kai?” To which Kai replied: “Why would I? Is there a reason you have lowered yourself?” Before she could answer him, however, one of their classmates interrupted them. “It looks as if they are talking to each other, cool.”<br />
<br />
Both Kai and Susan looked around confused at that. Then one of the girls petted Susan suddenly, making her turn, a bit angry for someone disturbing her hair, while Kai laughed at the picture. That was, until Mike started petting him, too. “What are you doing, Mike?” he asked surprised, and the others laughed at the screeching he made. <br />
For some odd reason, Susan couldn´t push the hand petting her hair away, she even leaned into it. “Do you want a banana?” asked Chris, producing two from his bag. While both Susan and Kai answered “No” simultaneously and shook their head also, both moved their right hands towards them. Chris split them, handing one to each waiting hand, laughing at the, too them, eager awaiting monkeys.<br />
Now both Susan and Kai were even more confused. Why had they accepted the banana from Chris? Without much thought through, both had already peeled their bananas and stuffed it into their mouths, earning even more laughter Just then, one of the caretakers came by, and, noticing the two monkeys between the students, came over. She turned towards the class after seeing the banana peels. “Normally, you shouldn´t feed the monkeys, but just these once I won´t scold you, as it helps me to bring them back. Now come, Kai, Susan, you must get back in.”<br />
Neither Kai nor Susan was happy being pushed by the caretaker, angrily screeching for her to stop pushing them, and for the others to help. But nobody helped, some even laughed at their protest. Ty moved with them, and soon they ended up in the enclosure with the other monkeys.<br />
<br />
After the caretaker closed the door, both rushed back to it, screaming to be let out again. The watching class chuckled, thinking they were angry that the caretaker stopped them from receiving more bananas and pets.<br />
Ty spoke to them nearly at the same time, only switching their names. “Calm down, Kai/Susan, you are safe here. Why have you tried to get away from your home? Needed some alone time with your mate? Or did you think a monkey like you wouldn´t stand out between these humans?”<br />
“I´m not a monkey, whoever you are. Let me out of here. I´m human, and Susan is a friend, not my mate.” Kai screeched in return. Susan had slumped back a bit, screeching a bit quieter: “I´m a human, not some ordinary monkey. And as much as I like Kai, he´s not my mate.”<br />
As they could understand each other, both turned towards each other afterwards. “What did you say?” they asked each other simultaneously again. But now both took notice in each other’s changes. Both had by now longer, and hairier arms, reaching the ground without problem in their lowered stand. And their clothes looked loose on them. Both watched in shock as the other´s ears grew bigger and rounder.<br />
As Ty saw that both had a tail growing behind them, he spoke again: “What kind of human has a tail, Kai? None, only animals have. You´re a monkey, so stop pretending to be not.” Kai screeched angrily: “I don´t have a tail, I´m human, let me out. Keep Susan, if you need to.”<br />
“Nobody said ordinary but you, Susan. You´re a monkey like your mate Kai, accept it.” Susan was far to confused by now. “I´m not a monkey, and Kai isn´t my mate, dammit. Kai, what happened to your ears? And is that a tail?” <br />
<br />
Ty made a silent wish so they could notice their own changes now, grinning at them. Kai looked at Susan like she was crazy, but felt his head, finding his ears. With a gasp, he searched for a tail, quickly finding it, too. “But … I´m not a monkey, what is happening here? Susan, you have both yourself, what´s happening to us?”<br />
Susan, in turn, looked behind here, spotting her new tail growing longer. “No, that can´t be. I don´t know, Kai, but we need help.” As they sat there in shocked silence, they continued to change. By now, most of their clothes seemed a couple of sizes to big on them, as they both had shrunken a good bit. Both started scratching themselves, as their fur had grown under their clothes, making it itch.<br />
When their feet started to feel cramped in their shoes, paired with the itch all over their skin, both reflexively started to rip on their clothes, and within seconds had turned everything beside their shoes and socks into shreds of cloth. As their shoes didn´t bulge as they wanted, both used more force to tear them apart, howling in pain at how constricting they felt.<br />
Only when they finally were both naked, they realized what they had done, and both turned red in embarrassment. By now they both looked like monkeys with human heads, beside the ears. As their faces started to stretch a bit, Ty spoke again. “You are a monkey, Kai, stop pretending being a human. Now, finally mate your mate and mark her as yours.” Kai spluttered at that. “No, I´m not pretending to be human. Whatever happened here isn´t normal, I´m no monkey. And I won´t mate Susan, dammit.”<br />
“Susan, you are a fine, clever monkey. You know you aren´t human, so show your mate that you love him finally.” Susan was near crying by now. “I´m not a monkey, I´m not. Kai, we need to get help before we lose our minds.” By now a part of here watched Kai with lust. She was to shy to ask Kai out, but in their situation maybe she would be able to.<br />
<br />
Ty decided to finish their changes now. “I wish for both Susan and Kai to finish changing. Kai will get needy to release, as will Susan, and they will be overwhelmed by their need and mate with each other. While they mate, their humanity will slip away. Any control will move to the newly developed monkey minds, but their minds will stay intact, only pushed back by new memories and instincts of being monkeys and mates. Their shred clothes will vanish, and their new family will accept and welcome them.”<br />
Before Kai could stop himself, he moved towards Susan, his need for release forcing him towards her. Susan´s own need let her turn around, presenting her parts towards Kai. And before either could stop it, they mated each other. Just as both realized what they were doing, any control they had left them. The new monkey mind took over, only increasing their mating, much to their embarrassment. <br />
Kai screamed mentally: “Stop, I need to stop. Susan is my friend, I can´t do this to her. Much less in front of everyone watching us. I´m not a dumb animal, please.” His new mind answered slowly, to much focus on the mating: “Yes, we need … to mate… We aren´t dumb, … we´re a … clever monkey… Why stop for …some humans …watching? …We aren´t … like them.”<br />
Susan wasn´t in any better shape, but already more accepting: “We need to stop. I´m not a monkey, and neither is Kai. We need help.” Her new mind was also slower, but answered her: “Yeah, we needed … help … to release … we will … finally … be mates … we aren´t … humans … but monkeys… wild and … free.”<br />
<br />
The more intense their mating got, the more Kai and Susan were pushed back as new memories and instincts took over completely. While Susan had nearly fully accepted her new life, Kai wasn´t that happy, but could do nothing. Both were buried deep within their bodies, watching what these monkeys did with them.<br />
Ty grinned as he left, satisfied with the results. He saw the other monkeys come over, accepting their new members as family. And as he probed, he got the confirmation that at least Susan was happy by now.</p>
