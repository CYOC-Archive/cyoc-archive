<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Did you really think I wouldn&#39;t notice?&quot; Jeff pulled Finn in tightly. Then ruffled Finn&#39;s bright orange fur between his fox ears. He leaned down, hand still resting on Finn&#39;s head and whispered. &quot;Or did you just want a reason to hang out tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn squirmed under the pressure. The deep, sexual rumble of Jeff&#39;s voice quietly reminding him of the night before was a bit more than he was used to. And feeling that strong hand guide him around the school felt better than he had expected as well. Part of him wondered if he should make himself a bit more confident, but the warning of unexpected changes still lingered in the back of his mind. He&#39;d been playing with the device so nonchalantly that he didn&#39;t what all had changed. Though, the &#39;get out of jail free&#39; card could always be, &#39;reality is back to what it was before I changed anything using this device.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Jeff stood back up as they continued walking. &quot;Using my idea doesn&#39;t really seem all that fair. So maybe we should try again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A-again?&quot; Finn felt flustered all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jeff shrugged his wide shoulders. &quot;Why not? It&#39;s not fair that you just made Bryce love sucking my dick just because I said so. Sure, I was pent up. And sure he&#39;s a fucking natural. Though...&quot; he trailed off for a second. &quot;I have like a ton of memories of him doing it... Weird. It&#39;s like I know I told you to change it. But it&#39;s also like he&#39;d always been doing it...&quot; Finn&#39;s claws dug into Jeff&#39;s leg as he heard this. Jeff looked down and smiled. &quot;What?&quot; suddenly he was being coy. &quot;Don&#39;t be jealous. &#39;We&#39;re not dating&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re straight.&#39;&quot; He held up his fingers, to add the quotes around it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph!&quot; Finn breathed. He tried to pull away but felt his collar being pulled and then lifted up off the ground like it was nothing. &quot;What.&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
The two were eye to eye, despite there being two feet in height difference. &quot;All I&#39;m saying is why not try again. For science. If I win, you come out and we start dating. You win? I give you the same experience as before. Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn&#39;s eyes narrowed. He let out a grumpy grunt from the back of his throat. &quot;I thought you weren&#39;t interested in the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m interested in you,&quot; Jeff smirked. Somehow it was uncompromisingly devious.<br />
<br />
Finn&#39;s face would have turned even redder had it not been for the bright orange fur covering his face. He was still the first to break eye contact as his body seemed to collapse in on itself. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said a bit bashfully. Then held out his hand. &quot;Deal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff shook it. &quot;Deal.&quot; He placed Finn back down onto the ground but made sure to hold him tightly as they headed to the football field.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Finn sat in the bleachers as he waited for the football team to run onto the field. He&#39;d never had a reason to really be there, but something felt oddly nostalgic about looking at the 100 yard field and the red rubber track running around it. He shook the thought away, wondering more about what he should change. There were so many things he could do. However, the lingering thoughts of unintended consequences were there as well.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t really get the answer to that question earlier. Sure, Bryce was now a bit of a cock hound. That didn&#39;t mean he understood the full extent of what had changed in his life. The arrogant jock had a bit of a mean steak. Surely that was meant to change a bit now as he begged to please another man. &quot;Don&#39;t think too much,&quot; Finn shook his head again as he watched the cheerleaders going through their routine.<br />
<br />
The three men and several more women wore comfortable clothes as they went through basic moves. Mostly picking up the girls, tossing them in the air and then catching them. Finn knew the men had to be strong. Each one would easily catch the hundred+ pound girl in their arms and then lower them down to the ground. Finn always felt a bit of envy about girls like that. He was always built about the same, but besides being a cute mascot, guys didn&#39;t have any interest in catching him that way. A thought about Jeff tossing him in the air went through his mind, followed by being caught in his strong arms and being able to lean against his strong chest. It was quickly interrupted by another thought of just how high Jeff could probably throw him. The brute would probably find it funny to toss his small body as high as he possibly could.<br />
<br />
A flash of fear ran through Finn as he thought about being tossed effortlessly by the tiger. His heart rate was still raised as he pictured it. Finn turned his attention back to the field to distract himself from the thought. He saw Coach Kodiak and Coach Caldwell talking on the other side of the field. Kodiak had always been a bit bigger of a man. His large burly frame seemed to fill just about every room he was in, and his furry face and body gave him terrifying presence. Even if his face was incredibly round, that didn&#39;t give him much of a friendly appearance as his gruff attitude made it hard for anyone to get too close. That attitude was also perfect for keeping a group of newly adult men in check. His testosterone easily clashed with theirs and he wasn&#39;t about to put up with much shit from a single one of them.<br />
<br />
Caldwell was a bit different. Even if he wasn&#39;t a completely sympathetic ear, he could still play good cop to Kodiak&#39;s bad cop pretty well. Being a bit two and a half decades younger than the other man allowed him to relate to the 20 year old&#39;s a bit better. Even if it wasn&#39;t perfect, he at least knew what a Tiktok was. Plus, with his more athletic form, he could do more than just lift heavy weights. Sure, it wasn&#39;t as tone or lean as it was when he was in his twenties, but his muscles weren&#39;t nearly as covered in extra bulk as the other coach. That didn&#39;t mean he was by any means small. He made sure the red polo&#39;s the school issued to him fit tightly across his shoulders and chest. The buttons straining against the strength built in there. <br />
<br />
Their attention shifted as the players started getting onto the field. They barked a few orders and the athletes started doing their stretches. After a bit of a warmup the coach barked at them to get in a few formations. Finn watched as Jeff took his stance and more at Bryce as the golden retriever&#39;s tail wagged each and every time another player had to bend over in front of him to hike the ball. &#39;Unintended consequences?&#39; Finn mused to himself as he watched them play. Bryce was still the star of the show as he could still throw the ball down the field and hit whatever pocket he needed to. <br />
<br />
Finn wondered if it was further than he used to or not. It&#39;s not like Finn was ever paying attention to things like that. Being able to possibly see a player&#39;s jock was far more interesting than the actual game. Still, practice would be at least a couple of hours. He wondered what he should change about it to make it more interesting for him. Sure, seeing how big the pads made Jeff look and watching his tail swish back and forth as he&#39;s figuring out how to strike his opponent was interesting but probably not going to keep his attention the entire time. And should it be an instant TF or a long drawn out one. Decisions... Decisions...</p>
