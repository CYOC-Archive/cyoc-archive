<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night ultimately passed well enough. Martha and William said their good nights to the Twists, with Martha again emphasizing finding some time for a &quot;girl&#39;s night&quot; which was agreed to and accepted, but with things as they were, it was also agreed that the past night wasn&#39;t the night for that. Martha had felt a lot better about her confidence and her sexuality since becoming a werecat and was greatly pleased on how William&#39;s bond to her worked as a werefox. In that context, their new life in Moon Lake was a great gift that neither wanted to give up or lose.<br />
<br />
This proposed &quot;great reveal&quot; though would be one that was likely to be problematic going forward for all of Moon Lake&#39;s residents one way or another. Those that didn&#39;t want it would see it as a threat to their safety, as Moon Lake and weres had managed to &quot;hide in the open&quot; as it were for centuries, largely dependent on the fact that after the Medieval period and the hysteria that also went along with the witch trials and werewolf hunts of the period that went on even into the 1600s, in some places, had died down it became something where most of humanity didn&#39;t even believe such things as werewolves were real anymore. William and Martha had been in that group and didn&#39;t fully believe it when Samantha Twist told them about weres. Now as weres, a part of them sympathized with that line of thought, that people who didn&#39;t believe weres were real would jump to negative conclusions before learning the truth. Those that believed in that path weren&#39;t likely to just okay the proposal any time soon.<br />
<br />
The other half of the equation would be with those weres that were for revealing at least the existence of weres. That their ability to hide in recent years was more due to luck than anything else and that coming out while they could control the narrative would be the best choice, and might even offer weres the ability to embrace who and what they truly were in a way that they really couldn&#39;t at present. And a part of William and Martha both saw things from that point of view and relished the possibility of being in their were forms as much as they could, and not just limited to the hours of darkness or in their homes. That part of were society would likely battle with the negative side just as much over the issue.<br />
<br />
The worries over both had sent them to discuss things with the Twists the previous evening and both were relieved to get the assurances that the city would pay attention to all sides and make sure that things weren&#39;t rushed. That assured that the worst of the fears that William and Martha had, particularly for Eric and Nate. Though the two remained a bit nervous until they heard their back door enter and was soon followed by the sound of Nate&#39;s footsteps coming up the stairs and heading to his bedroom. That let them relax into relatively calm sleep. With it being a Sunday, neither William nor Martha set the alarm and actually slept in until some of the rays of morning sunlight came over the eastern horizon and some of the light was reflected back into their windows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm… morning,&quot; William said to Martha as he watched her eyes flutter open.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; Martha asked with a small yawn as she sat up in the bed, letting the blanket and comforter fall into her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little after eight,&quot; William answered as he looked over his shoulder, &quot;We should get up. I can make some pancakes and we can then move on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Move on?&quot; Martha wondered as she stood up and looked to her husband as he stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t control what the city does... and what Samantha and Frances told us last night was helpful,&quot; William pointed out, &quot;the best we can do is move on with the things we have to do. I have the coming week&#39;s class lectures and things to prepare and I&#39;m sure you have some studying to do. I&#39;d be more than willing to help, if you wish it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d actually be great,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I could use some help going over some of the key terms and practices that are in the packets that you brought home.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, they managed to get dressed and Martha collected her studying materials that William had collected from the college&#39;s department of education. Things were relative quiet in Nate&#39;s room, although the growling snores coming from the room indicated that both still asleep and in his fursona. With no one expected to arrive that Sunday morning except perhaps Eric at the very end to the day, if at all, they let Nate sleep and quietly made their way downstairs. As they made it to the kitchen their conversation resumed as Martha set the study guides down, which included the main read out for the comping Praxis test for the State of Washington that Martha would have to take in the Spring.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how would you like me to do this?&quot; William asked his wife as he went to one set of drawers to get the large bowl that the batter for the waffles would be mixed in, &quot;There will be a bit that I&#39;ll have to take directly from the study guide from. Some of the basic principles will be the same as certain elements in teaching will carry over from elementary through to even the college levels that I teach at, which is predominantly with those seeking Bachelor&#39;s degrees. From time to time I might get some graduate students... but in terms of the &quot;teaching,&quot; there are certain details that you say you&#39;ve had to do that I don&#39;t have to do at the college level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, remembering some of their early courtship. They did meet in college and did hit it off, but because William stayed on in college to get his Masters in English and in Education, Martha actually entered the workforce before William did and the two spent a few years dating and living together while Martha taught at the elementary level and William worked on the degrees needed to teach at the college level. It had been a lucky streak for both of them that they were able to stay in the same area and close to the University of Minnesota where both of them had gone to college and where William would later teach. They had agreed that they&#39;d both struck one and a million odds that work and graduate school had not separated the two of them before they got married. It was that that gave Martha earlier experience at teaching than William, and she&#39;d only given it up when she became pregnant with Nate and looked like William would be able to support the family on his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... there&#39;s a bit more responsiveness that is needed at the grade school level,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;you&#39;ll have to diversify some of your subject knowledge, as a lot of the grades may not have kids move from teacher to teacher for certain subjects outside of electives like PE and music and thus teach a little bit math, science, history, and English schools... and there&#39;s also the cognitive level differences that you&#39;ll need to understand. Think about it like when Nate was seven to eleven times twenty or more. The kids won&#39;t understand the words you know and won&#39;t process some of the thinking related skills as easily. There will also be some special needs issues you&#39;ll need to be able to recognize at the lower levels. Schools will often have aides for special education students, but there may still be specific needs that certain students may have that you will HAVE to pay attention to.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded in agreement there. That was actually one of the reasons he preferred teaching at the college level.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... right now... the best thing that I will need is just to go over what you think would be likely questions on certain elements from the study guide and go from there,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;It&#39;d help me focus and put some reasoning together... as there will be some answers that are multiple choice and some that require written answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded as he set up the waffle iron on the counter and plugged it into the wall. While the iron warmed up he began measuring the ingredients to make the batter for the waffles.  As he mixed them the looked over the first page on the study guide and looked for things he could use for a question. Eventually he found one he could work with.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are the seven learning styles?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Visual, musical/audial, verbal, physical/kinesthetic, logical/mathematical, social, and solitary,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and will also be something that need to be balanced when working with elementary school students. No two students learn the same way. Eric has been more of a verbal and solitary learner while Nate is more of a group learner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because Nate has done better in social settings,&quot; William commented, &quot;at least before Eric met Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, &quot;Okay... keep the questions coming...&quot;<br />
<br />
William smiled and their study session kept going.</p>
