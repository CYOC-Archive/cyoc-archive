<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A young girl, about 18 years-old, screamed in horror as she suddenly spotted the baby, crawling out in the middle of the street, in front of the house where she was babysitting for the day! She was distracted for a moment, while talking on the cell phone. <br />
<br />
The momentary distraction allowed the unsupervised baby to crawl out into the street, just as a sedan was approaching it at high speed!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a large, muscular figure swooped down from out of the sky, grabbed the baby with both hands, and gently lifted it off the ground. And this happened just a few seconds, before the speeding car raced right past the spot where the baby was crawling!<br />
<br />
The young man, who was driving the sports car, finally came to a halt. He stopped the car and ran out towards the girl, who was screaming hysterically!<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry! I didn’t see the baby! Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the tall, muscular boy landed on both feet, right before the young lady, and handed her the small child. She hugged it tightly, with tears from her eyes. When she looked up to catch another glimpse of the great hero, the Paladin was gone!<br />
<br />
Seconds later, the 9-foot boy landed on Orange Avenue, right before Dustin’s front lawn. Three birds landed on the curb, touching down at exactly the same moment. <br />
<br />
Kent, who was the tall, muscular boy, who had just rescued the lost baby, started to make his way into the house, when the three birds suddenly begin to transform into the familiar, human figures.<br />
<br />
Each bird grew larger and larger, as the thin, short legs stretched out and formed human legs and feet. The wings merged with the back, and the fine hair disappeared, revealing smooth skin. The bodies became more human-like, with arms forming on the sides, and the beak and eyes shifted, so that the animal-like qualities were slowly being replaced with human heads and facial expressions. Within seconds, the three birds had transformed into the figures of Peter, Ty and Allen. As soon as the transformation was complete, their clothes immediately covered them, and they appeared standing on the curb, while looking up to the young hero!<br />
<br />
“Wow, Kent! You were great!” Ty cheered, as he walked up to the tall, muscular boy. Kent practically looked like a character from Greek Mythology, with golden headband over his forehead, wrist bands on his wrists, and the white spandex tank top and pants. He was a cross between a gymnast and a football player, with long, curly hair and the “P” symbol engraved on his chest. Kent was wearing the ultra modern sunglasses with dark blue lenses, and he had long, gold-colored boots. “How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“It feels weird, being so big!” Kent grinned, as he dwarfed Ty by three-and-a-half feet. “Let me see if I can shrink back to my old size, until I hear the next cry for help.”<br />
<br />
Kent quietly wished to shrink back to his old height. His body slowly shrunk down to his previous height, which was 5’4”, just two inches shorter than Ty. He finally made it, and turned to walk towards the house.<br />
<br />
But wait! Some other force was at work in Kent’s muscular body! As soon as he reached the height of 5’4”, he slowly started to grow again!<br />
<br />
“Hey! I’m growing back!” he exclaimed, as he stopped to look at his friends while he felt his own body grow once more.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, he had reached the height of 6’8” before the growth stopped. Kent just stared at Ty, wondering what was going on.<br />
<br />
“You can’t shrink yourself down, to be any shorter than 6’8”, Kent!” Ty laughed, as he walked up to the big, muscle boy, who loomed over him by more than a foot. “I’m tired of seeing you getting bullied by everyone because you’re shorter than everyone else in school. From now on, you’re going to be the tallest, and definitely the most muscular!<br />
<br />
“Wow… this is great! Kent grinned, as he looked down at Allen and Peter.<br />
<br />
He had to get used to being the tallest kid in the group!<br />
<br />
“I got you the shades, Kent!” Peter chuckled, looking up at the boy, who reached and adjusted the super-modern dark sunglasses with the curved frame and the blue lenses.<br />
<br />
“I say we take our Paladin to the mall or something…” Allen remarked. “I need to buy some new shoes this weekend…”<br />
<br />
Ty wished for them to be in the heart of the shopping mall, and the gang strolled around there for awhile. They were even joined by Kody, Jason, Tim, and Dustin. All four of them were amazed, when they noticed that the big, muscular kid was in fact Kent, who had always been so quiet, geeky, and timid and so horribly shy!<br />
<br />
Both Ty and Peter noticed that Kent still had some fears and insecurity to overcome. He felt a little uncomfortable about being the biggest and the most muscular in the group. Both Peter and Ty thought about what to do to help Kent overcome the insecurity, when Prince appeared standing right before them! Only Ty and Peter were able to see and hear Prince!<br />
<br />
“You guys did a great job with Kent!” Prince said, commending the two teenage wizards on their handiwork. “But Kent still has some insecurity, deeply engrained in his mind, as a result of years of teasing, put-downs, ridicule and rejection. I have just the thing! I will propose that Kent be given a trigger, which will initiate his marvelous growth! The trigger will be the word ‘grow’ and it can be used anyone, including those who don’t have magical powers!”<br />
<br />
“I will now add my own power to Kent, and the trigger will be instituted immediately, making him grow to his incredible height of nine feet for at least five minutes!” Prince added, before he disappeared into thin air once again.<br />
<br />
Ty wanted to test the trigger, and walked up to Dustin. Ty whispered the word in Dustin’s ear, and asked him to give it a try.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Kent…” Dustin called out. Kent stopped and turned around, as Dustin walked up to him. Dustin stared at him for a moment, before uttering the magic word.<br />
<br />
“Grow!”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Whoa!” Kent exclaimed, as he felt his body suddenly being overcome with a strong, tingling feeling. Kent began to grow!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s going on? How did you do that?” Kent gasped, as he slowly continued to rise up, while looking down. His legs were longer, as well as his torso. His muscles grow bigger, to match Kent’s increase in height. Within seconds, Kent was standing tall as a nine-foot giant, dwarfing every single being in the busy shopping mall!<br />
<br />
“You’ve been given a trigger, which will cause you to grow to 9 feet tall for at least five minutes!” Ty explained. “Anyone can call out the magic word, which is ‘grow’, and it will cause you to grow to this height! This is to help you grow in your confidence!”<br />
<br />
The boys all laughed, as they continued to walk down the large, wide hallways of the busy shopping mall, while they enjoyed the company of Kent, who was the biggest and most muscular kid on earth.<br />
<br />
Where would they go next?<br />
<br />
<br />
(Best regards from Scriptboy in Florida! Grow!)</p>
