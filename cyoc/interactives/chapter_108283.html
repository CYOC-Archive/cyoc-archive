<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeanie dissappeared so fast that Marcus wasn&#39;t able to do anything. He was getting sick of all these changings and he just wanted to bite her in the ankle. Wait, bite her? He realized he was growling to her like if he was a normal dog.<br />
&quot;And now I&#39;m acting like a dog. Great, Marcus!&quot; He said to himself. &quot;You&#39;re losing your last bits of dignity. Oh, well. At least I like dogs, they aren&#39;t as big and messy as horses.&quot; At that moment, the other dog came close to him. &quot;Hey doggy! Can you understand me?&quot; Marcus tried to talk like in the animated movies but he just barked like a regular dog. &quot;Of course I won&#39;t speak like talking dogs in movies. I wonder how dogs communicate... maybe it&#39;s the nose, I can smell a lot of things.&quot;<br />
The other dog began to circle him, looking at Marcus from all angles. Marcus was too astounded that he didn&#39;t move. When the other dog stopped, it moved behind Marcus and suddenly sniffed Marcus&#39; butt.<br />
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; Marcus yelled in his mind but he just barked at the other dog. &quot;Give me some space!&quot;<br />
Marcus began to run from the other dog but the animal believed he was playing and followed him throughout the whole park. Marcus felt a lot of exciting during running. He thought  that maybe it&#39;s because dogs love running.<br />
After some minutes he began to slow down, he was getting tired. But the other dog wasn&#39;t and when it reached Marcus, it kept sniffing his butt.<br />
&quot;I must think of a way to get away that dog!&quot; He thought. But he was too tired to run again and nothing else he did was helpful. &quot;I need to... think... of...&quot; He was too stressed when that happened. The other dog, inmediately stopped sniffing his butt and ran away from Marcus.<br />
Marcus was pooping in the middle of the park!<br />
&quot;Oh no no no!!&quot; He screamed in his mind. &quot;I didn&#39;t want this! How embarrassing!&quot;<br />
People who was walking around were looking the disgusting scene. Some of them were making commentaries about how an irresponsable owner can let his/her dog do that in the park. Marcus was completely embarrassed. He wasn&#39;t just pooping in the middle of the park but also he was considered just a pet that someone has left free in the park without its leash.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a pet! I&#39;m a human being like you!!&quot; He tried to yell, but he just made bark after bark instead. &quot;Jeanie! Jeanie! Where are you?!&quot;<br />
Marcus ran to look for Jeanie but he was too tired to go through the whole park, so he stopped and leaned under a tree.<br />
&quot;Being an animal is horrible.&quot; Marcus thought. &quot;I can&#39;t speak, I feel less than a human... I&#39;m naked...&quot;<br />
Some minutes later the other dog came back. It saw Marcus leaning under the tree and it decided to make him company. Both dogs stayed under the tree for some time until Jeanie finally returned.<br />
&quot;Marcus! I see that you and the doggy are now better friends! So good!&quot; Jeanie said with her usual smiling. Marcus stood up and ran directly to her.<br />
He was too happy to see her that he didn&#39;t realice he was moving his tail and his tongue was outside his mouth. He looked like any other dog that was happy to see its master to come back and in some way, Jeanie was now his master. He jumped over her and began to lick her cheeks.<br />
&quot;Ow! Marcus! You&#39;re so sweet!&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;I&#39;m so happy that you have accepted your dog&#39;s side.&quot; She made him to move back and continued talking. &quot;But you now you can stay as a dog. We need more animal&#39;s DNAs!&quot;<br />
Then Marcus reacted to what he was doing. He was too happy that he left his dog&#39;s impulses to take control of his actions, but he definetely didn&#39;t want to stay as a dog. He was a human being after all. After hearing what Jeanie said he realized he won&#39;t able to escape to what she had planned so he thought that the best way to finish this torture was to make it as fast as possible. He lay face up and opened his legs.<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;m ready.&quot; He said.<br />
&quot;Marcus, are you trying to tell me that you are ready?&quot; Jeanie asked him and Marcus barked in agreement. After that, the other dog stayed next to Marcus and mimicked his stance. &quot;Doggy, do you want to join us? Excellent! All is better with more friends!&quot;<br />
&quot;Just do it!&quot; Marcus tried to say her with a bark.<br />
&quot;Ok! In three!&quot; Jeanie said and Marcus felt arousal in his balls and his member. &quot;Two!&quot; His pointy red dick began to come out from his sheath. Ugh, sheath. He won&#39;t never get accostumed to think about that. &quot;One! Shoot!&quot; <br />
At that moment, a white goo came out from his dick followed by the one that the other dog shot. Jeanie caught both loads in midair with her magic and saved them inside a tiny jar. She had two more where she was keeping Marcus&#39; human and horse loads.<br />
&quot;Ok, Marcus. You can turn back to human now!&quot; Jeanie snapped her finger and Marcus quickly turned back to a human teenager but he didn&#39;t move from his actual position. &quot;Marcus. I&#39;ve turned you back into a human. Why are you staying there?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve decided that if you need me to shoot load after load, the fastest way it&#39;s to doing it one after another. I will stayed like this until you finish to collect those things, with my legs opened and my dick pointing up like it was right now. You don&#39;t need to turn me back to human after each load until you finish. So, please made it quickly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, Marcus! You impressed me!&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;You are the best assistant a genie could wish! Ok! I&#39;ll take your word!&quot; She saw at the dog which was next to him in the same position that Marcus. &quot;And you can change with Marcus too, doggy! Ok, let&#39;s do it!&quot;<br />
&quot;The doggy? Don&#39;t you thiii-&quot; Marcus tried to say but his voice stopped when Jeanie turned him into a bull.<br />
&quot;Wow! Bulls have heavy artillery in their balls!&quot; Jeanie said as she saw the two sets of bull balls that Marcus and the doggy were sporting to her. Marcus was embarrassed of Jeanie&#39;s comments but he kept going with his plan. &quot;Ok, three, two, one...&quot; After some seconds, he was shooting his bull&#39;s DNA. &quot;Let&#39;s continue!&quot;<br />
It was an intense session of transforming and cumming. Marcus went through a long journey of arousal and embarrassment. He turned from a bull to an alligator, then to a deer, a gorilla, a lion and a duck. Jeanie always made a comment after each transformation which made Marcus more and more embarrassed but he kept going. The doggy was changing too but it didn&#39;t look like it was upset.<br />
They went through mice, kangaroos, lizards, elephants, roosters, monkeys, seals, camels, snakes, ostriches, zebras, cats, pigs, walrus, even dinousaurs and insects!<br />
After a hard session, Marcus and the former dog had gone through almost all the animal kingdom and now they were bears. A brown bear in the case of Marcus and a black one for the former dog.<br />
&quot;Ok! This is our last! Make your best effort!&quot; Jeanie said.<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; Marcus said with a relief growl.<br />
&quot;In three!&quot; Jeanie said and Marcus felt the habitual arousal in his genitalia. &quot;Two!&quot; His bear dick which was outside from his sheath since they started, stiffened. &quot;One!&quot; Marcus felt his semen going from his bear balls to his dick until it was out. &quot;Done!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok!&quot; Marcus said in his mind. &quot;Now, turn me back into a human and let me go!&quot;<br />
Jeanie smiled and began to move her hands as if she was going to use her magic again, but what will she do?</p>
