<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dantalyon was sorely tempted to kill the idiot.  But ultimately, even though he came by his bigoted ways honestly, she could tell Trent had been manipulated- a seed of hatred had been planted deep within him.  Only a demon would do such a thing, which meant she had a rival...or even an enemy.<br />
<br />
So she decided to spare him.  She held up his head and looked into his eyes.  “Trent.  You will grow to realize exactly what you&#39;ve done here tonight.  You will be filled with great shame.  You will leave everything you own to your family, and then abandon them.  Never again shall your presence darken their doorstep.<br />
<br />
Go to the police, and admit what you have done.  Perhaps in durance you will find salvation.  Perhaps not.  Either way, begone with you.”<br />
<br />
Trent got up, and like a zombie, began to walk to the police station, leaving his wallet and his keys on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
Lee tidied up the house, then stepped outside.  Whoever had manipulated Trent had to be close, in fact...<br />
<br />
There.  She felt an unseen presence.  “Show yourself!”<br />
<br />
A girl in her middle teens and average height stepped into view.  She had short blonde hair and blue eyes.  She wore a dark red backless jumpsuit, and had a sullen look about her.  But most notable of all was the greatsword strapped to her back.<br />
<br />
“Jophiel?!”  Dantalyon blinked.  The Archangel was about the last person she expected to find.<br />
<br />
“I go by Jo now, Dantalyon.  Huh, this was supposed to be a stealth mission.  Guess you caught me.”<br />
<br />
Dantalyon allowed her eyes to revert to their normal appearance, mirroring the night sky.  “You are responsible for this?”<br />
<br />
“What if I was?  Looking for a fight?”  Jo slipped her sword off her shoulder with ease.<br />
<br />
Thousands of years later, Dantalyon remembered what being struck by one of Michael&#39;s flaming swords felt like.  She wasn&#39;t keen on repeating the experience, but she&#39;d be damned (again!) if she let anyone just fuck around with her possessions!<br />
<br />
“Rude to answer a question with a question, Jo.”  She let disdain drip from her voice.<br />
<br />
Jo slowly grinned.  “Man, it&#39;d be great to throw down with you again.  You never did back down from anyone.  But”, she sighed.  “I haven&#39;t done anything, just been watching you playing with mortal lives.  Heaven is concerned about whatever you&#39;re up to.”<br />
<br />
“Really?  Why would that be?  Soul collection is perfectly acceptable, isn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
“Come on, &#39;Lee&#39;.  You have minions for that.  Coming here in person to collect souls?  You didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be noticed?”<br />
<br />
“I was summoned.  Last I checked, that&#39;s allowed.”  Dantalyon let her eyes return to dark violet, and reigned in her aura, becoming &#39;Lee&#39; again.<br />
<br />
“Oh it is.  But these aren&#39;t your usual souls.  I thought you only went after the wicked ones, Lee.  Corrupting pure souls?  Tsk tsk.”<br />
<br />
“Cole came to me.  And you really don&#39;t know anything about me these days, Jo.  Well go on staring, I&#39;ll make sure to give you a good show.”  She turned to go.<br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t be like that.  Don&#39;t you want to know why Heaven is worried?”  Jo taunted.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I mean, if you must spread gossip.”  Lee sounded bored.<br />
<br />
“Gemory is on Earth as well.  She&#39;s also been entangled with some mortal lives.”<br />
<br />
“I admit, I didn&#39;t know that.  So two of us on Earth, that&#39;s enough to get Heaven&#39;s attention?”<br />
<br />
Jo put the sheath of her sword into the ground, point first, and leaned on her sword with a naughty smile.  “Well it might interest you to know that someone baited Gemory.  Made sure the summoning would work, and that she&#39;d find someone interesting.”<br />
<br />
“Now that is a coincidence.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“Wait...you mean, you know?”<br />
<br />
“That someone deliberately made sure Cole found a book with a spell that would really call me forth?  Of course I did, Jo.  Gemory is strong, but she isn&#39;t always cautious.  I knew that Cole was bait.  I figured out what she was the instant I tasted her blood.  She has Fallen Angel in her.  Her father was a Nephilim.”<br />
<br />
Jo stood straight and applauded.  “Impressive.  Those quill pushers upstairs completely missed her existence.”<br />
<br />
“And no doubt that was intentional.  But she has a soul, being three quarters mortal, so my claim cannot be contested.”<br />
<br />
“You haven&#39;t told her.”<br />
<br />
Lee shook her head.  “Even though I tasted it in her blood, I wasn&#39;t sure at first, I needed more evidence.  And what good would it do?  I doubt her mother knows anything.  No need to confuse the girl right now.”<br />
<br />
“You actually sound like you care.”  Jo sneered.<br />
<br />
“But I do!  I don&#39;t hate mortals, you know.  Even back then, I thought they were just pawns in the Creator&#39;s game, nothing more than innocent lab mice.  There was no reason to keep us in the dark about their ultimate purpose.  We could have helped!”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s where you and I differ.  I hate mortals.”<br />
<br />
Lee blinked.  “You&#39;ve changed.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, I&#39;ve changed.  Thousands of years of loyalty to my Creator, knowing only love for them.  I tried so fucking hard, Lee.  I watched over them, guided them, ever the gentle shepherd.  But what do they do?  They rape, they fuck, they kill each other!  God gave them a GIFT.  The greatest gift anyone has ever been given!  And no matter how many times they disappoint, the experiment continues.<br />
<br />
They are cruel, imperfect things and should be destroyed!  God HAS perfection!  Us!  But do we have Free Will?  No!  They are free to believe in whatever they want, love whoever they want!  And I feel nothing for them!  Nothing at all!”<br />
<br />
“Oh Jophiel...”  Lee sighed.  “How is it that you remain loyal, when you have it all wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Because I can&#39;t!  I can&#39;t defect!  I can&#39;t turn from God!  God is the only thing I have ever loved!  Can ever love!  And I mean NOTHING to God!  I&#39;m just a tool.  God is no more fond of me than a screwdriver!”  Jo&#39;s aura was becoming erratic, and Lee could glimpse her halo.<br />
<br />
It should be as bright as the sun.  It was not, instead it was the pale silver of the moon.<br />
<br />
“Jo, you&#39;re hurting inside.  Let me help you.”  Lee spread her arms in a non-threatening gesture.<br />
<br />
For a brief instant, there was something in Jo&#39;s eyes.  A glimmer of...hope.  Then it was gone.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, Lee!  You pity me!  YOU, a Fallen, pity me!  How dare you!  I don&#39;t want it!  I don&#39;t need it!”  She vanished into the shadows, and soon Lee lost track of her, but the Angel left her with one last taunt.<br />
<br />
“Watch your back, traitor!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee was sobered when she returned to her home, walking in the front door.  This was a turn she hadn&#39;t expected.  Her &#39;sister&#39; was in great pain, and going mad.  And Heaven wasn&#39;t doing anything about it!<br />
<br />
The Rebellion had broken them all.  Most had managed to find some way to carry on.  But apparently, some never really recovered.  Jophiel had once been one of the gentlest of her kind.  She carried her sword not merely as a weapon, but also a sign of her penance.<br />
<br />
Now she was unstable, and could become a threat to mortals.  She wasn&#39;t sure who to contact about this- obviously, no emissary of Heaven would respond to her call, and most of her fellow Fallen wouldn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
She found everyone in her living room, curled up under blankets.  Cindy and Alison flanked Marion, their mother, on the couch, and Winrya, in her Tara form, was hugging Alison.<br />
<br />
Cole was seated apart from the others, watching them sadly.  Lee instantly realized her apprentice felt somehow responsible for this.  As if it wouldn&#39;t have happened if she hadn&#39;t sold her soul.<br />
<br />
Well perhaps not, but if anyone, Lee was the more responsible.<br />
<br />
“Is everyone ok?”<br />
<br />
Everyone looked to her save Marion, who stared lifelessly.  A broken heart.  She had loved Trent, for all his flaws, and then he&#39;d attacked their children.  Attacked her.<br />
<br />
“What happened to da...Trent?”  Cindy asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ah, what a tragic thing, when love dies&#39;, Lee thought.  “He realized what he&#39;d done and went to turn himself into the police.  He won&#39;t ever hurt you again.”<br />
<br />
Cindy relaxed slightly.  Ah.  She&#39;d thought he was dead.  Lee could admit she was tempted, but someone else was the architect of this sorrow.<br />
<br />
Lee walked up to Marion.  “Ma&#39;am?  I&#39;m Lee.  This is my house- your daughters are friends to me and my sister.  You are welcome here for as long as you want to stay.”<br />
<br />
Marion focused on Lee.  “Oh...thank you, Lee.  You and your sister are such pretty girls.  Are you sure your parents won&#39;t mind?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s just us.  Our parents are gone.  They left us with a great deal of money but...we&#39;d rather have them.”  Lee didn&#39;t see this as a lie, exactly.  She&#39;d rather have God&#39;s love than her entire kingdom.<br />
<br />
But that was lost ot her.<br />
<br />
Marion opened her arms.  “Come here, Lee.”<br />
<br />
Lee did as she was told, and the smaller woman pulled her into a hug.  “Thank you for helping my kids.”<br />
<br />
Lee hugged the woman back.  “It&#39;s my pleasure.  I wish Cindy had called me sooner.”<br />
<br />
Marion nodded.  “She should have called the police.  But...she&#39;s a good girl.  Even then, she didn&#39;t want to see her father go to jail.  She just wanted to protect us.  She&#39;s small, but she&#39;s a fighter.”<br />
<br />
She started crying.  “Not like me.  I saw Trent was changing...but I was a coward, I never stood up to him...oh my kids, I&#39;m so sorry!”<br />
<br />
Lee and Marion&#39;s daughters hugged her tightly, with Cindy assuring Marion that it wasn&#39;t her fault.<br />
<br />
Cole got up and left the room.  Lee shot Tara a glance, and the Succubus nodded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cole found herself in a bedroom.  It was sparsely furnished.  A guest room, perhaps?  She didn&#39;t understand the emotions whirling around inside her, but she hurt.  Even the growing need inside her barely registered.  She threw herself on the bed and started crying.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the small form of Tara joined her on the bed that she realized the Succubus was there.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Tara.  Shouldn&#39;t you be with Alison?”<br />
<br />
“You shouldn&#39;t be alone.”  Tara replied.<br />
<br />
“Nothing happened to me.  I&#39;m fine.”<br />
<br />
“Cole, you are totally -not- fine.  Succubus, remember?  I can sense your emotions, and you&#39;re all tore up inside.”<br />
<br />
Cole sighed.  “Stupid demon powers.”<br />
<br />
Tara nuzzled up against Cole&#39;s neck.  “Sorry, you can&#39;t keep secrets from us.  Lee cares about you, which means I care about you.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re not an extension of her, you know.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m her handmaiden.  So I kinda am.  Almost like being attached to her.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, very much.  She means more to me than my own existence.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t feel that way about her.  I don&#39;t deserve her caring about me.”  Cole muttered.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  That sounds like you&#39;re second-guessing her again.  You&#39;ll have to be punished.”<br />
<br />
“I want to be punished.” Cole admitted.  “I feel like somehow, this is all my fault.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Cole...silly girl.  Well I&#39;ll punish you if it makes you feel better, but I want you to understand something.  You are special to me.”<br />
<br />
“Why?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, you started a chain of events that has not fully resolved.  But part of that chain, included our meeting.  And seeing me with you, made Lee see me as if for the first time.  She had no idea I loved her.  Then you came along.  Don&#39;t you see?  If you hadn&#39;t summoned her, things would be the way they were for both of us.  So if you&#39;re responsible for what happened to Cindy and her family, you&#39;re also responsible for making me happier than I&#39;ve ever been.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not sure if those things cancel out.”<br />
<br />
“So what if they do?  Now get undressed.”<br />
<br />
“What?!”  Cole blinked.<br />
<br />
“Your punishment, dummy.  We&#39;re going to fuck now.”<br />
<br />
Cole sat up and started getting undressed.  “How is that punishment?”<br />
<br />
“You wanted to wallow in self pity.  I&#39;m not letting you do what you want.”  The Succubus girl started shedding her dress.<br />
<br />
“Well, ok, but can you take on your normal form?”<br />
<br />
“What, you don&#39;t find me cute?”<br />
<br />
“Oh you&#39;re adorable, but there&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to do all day, and Tara doesn&#39;t have figure for it.”  Cole smiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee eventually got the girls to a guest room (not the one that Cole and Winrya were using, though she felt a little bit of envy, as they were having fun).  Marion lay down with Alison in her arms, but Cindy followed her out the door.<br />
<br />
“You need rest too.”  Lee pointed out.<br />
<br />
“I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I&#39;d just stare at the ceiling.  Can we talk?”<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee nodded.  “Yes, come with me.”  She led the smaller girl to her master bedroom.  It featured an immense four-poster Victorian style bed with red silk sheets, a mirrored ceiling, and wood paneling on the walls.  Like all the rooms, it was completely soundproofed, and a ward on the door meant they would not be disturbed.<br />
<br />
She lit the room with candles, igniting them with a wave of her hand.  The hardwood floor was chilly, so she also ignited the fireplace.  “I should get some rugs in here.”  She mused.<br />
<br />
Tentatively, Cindy sat on the bed.  She looked nervous.  <br />
<br />
“What&#39;s wrong, my dear?”  Lee stripped naked in the girl&#39;s line of sight, knowing she&#39;d stare, before slipping on a lace nightgown with fabric so sheer it hid nothing from view.<br />
<br />
“Are you...are we...?”  Cindy gulped.<br />
<br />
“About to have sex?  Well I&#39;d like to.  I think you need it.  Badly.  But you wanted to talk, so I figured we could cuddle, unless you&#39;d be too distracted?”<br />
<br />
Cole bit her lower lip.  “I might be.  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s been weird for me since...you changed me.”<br />
<br />
“Come, get undressed and we can talk about it.”<br />
<br />
“Can I have a nightgown?”  Cindy asked, taking off her clothes.<br />
<br />
“Of course, my dear.”  Lee conjured one, red instead of her own lavender, but otherwise, in the same style.  She then arranged her pillows so they would be comfortable facing each other.<br />
<br />
Cindy put it on, frowning at little.  “Doesn&#39;t cover much.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not supposed to.  I usually sleep nude, this is for walking around the house.”  Lee grinned.  “We were Created naked after all.  There&#39;s no sin in it.  Even the Bible points that out.  Shame was unknown to humans before the Original Sin.”<br />
<br />
Cindy climbed onto the bed and lay facing Lee.  “Yeah.  I guess you&#39;re right.  I mean, of course you&#39;re right, you know everything.”<br />
<br />
“Not everything, my dear.  But a lot.”  Lee reached out to touch Cindy&#39;s hair, and was rewarded by the girl gasping and closing her eyes.  Lee stroked the girl&#39;s hair gently, and Cindy made a sound not unlike a cat purring.<br />
<br />
“Oh you like that, don&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
“Y...yes.  It feels really nice.”  Cindy slowly opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Good.”  Lee inched closer to the girl, so they were close enough to kiss.  “Now.  What did you want to talk about?”<br />
<br />
“Uh...sorry this is kind of distracting.”  Cindy admitted.<br />
<br />
“Are you aroused, my dear?”<br />
<br />
“I think...maybe?  It feels so different now, I&#39;m not sure.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, you&#39;re used to having your dick get hard, aren&#39;t you?”  Lee giggled.<br />
<br />
Cindy blushed.  “Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“So how do you feel now?”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s hard to breathe.  My heart is beating real fast.  And something weird is happening between my legs.  I can&#39;t explain it.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes, those are definitely signs of arousal.  Men are aroused rather easily, visual and tactile stimulus mostly.  But girls are also aroused by other things.  Sound, for example.”<br />
<br />
“Sound?”  Cindy frowned.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes.  It varies on the individual.  For some, the sounds of sex can do it.  You can feel more confident when your partner is loud and communicates their level of pleasure.  But it doesn&#39;t have to be sexual- music can trigger some people.  It will be like a tingling sensation.”<br />
<br />
“Wow.  That&#39;s...really cool.”  Cindy said.<br />
<br />
“It is cool, yes.  I can tell you find girls attractive, for example.  But as a man, you felt confused by your feelings.  Were you staring at girls because you felt attraction?  Or was it simply because you wished to join them, be one of them?”<br />
<br />
“I...sometimes had feelings about boys too.  I think.”  Cindy admitted.<br />
<br />
“I know, dear.  And maybe those were actual feelings.  Or maybe it was confusion because you feel girls should be attracted to boys.  And you very much felt like a girl.  Now that you have attained your dream, of course, you have to get used to different chemicals in your bloodstream, but your body is freer to express it&#39;s feelings.”<br />
<br />
“I think you&#39;re pretty hot.  But you&#39;re also...scary.  Dangerous.  Like...like a tiger.”<br />
<br />
“Deadly things can be quite beautiful.  And yes, I can be scary.  And dangerous.  But when you needed me, you called.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.  I...I couldn&#39;t stop him.”  She began to tear up.  “I was too weak!  I couldn&#39;t protect my family!”<br />
<br />
“Ah, dear.”  Lee pulled the girl into her arms and held her.  “You are not weak.  You fought off a man twice your size.  And did some real damage.”<br />
<br />
“It wasn&#39;t enough!”  Cindy sobbed.  “He was going to hit Alison!  And I couldn&#39;t do anything!”<br />
<br />
“Your sister means so much to you.”  Lee kissed Cindy&#39;s tears.  “But you did do something.  You clung to consciousness, and you called for help.”<br />
<br />
“I should have done more.”<br />
<br />
“Like what?”<br />
<br />
“Alison had a knife.”  Cindy said.<br />
<br />
“Ah.  Yes, she can be vicious, can&#39;t she?  So that&#39;s the problem.  You don&#39;t think you&#39;re ruthless enough.”<br />
<br />
“No.”  Cindy admitted. <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a balancing act.  If you were, would you care about your mother and little sister as much?  Would they love you as much, if you were a demon, not a young lady?”<br />
<br />
“I will be a demon though.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes you will.  But I wasn&#39;t going to change you right away.  And I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t.  I might have made you a Succubus like Winrya.  Thinking being pretty would be enough for you.  But I didn&#39;t realize that in here...”  She touched Cindy&#39;s breast, over her heart, which made the girl gasp.<br />
<br />
“Beats the heart of a warrior.  You like to fight.  You enjoy asserting your physical dominance over others.  Crushing bullies.  Competing in sports.”<br />
<br />
“I...I protect people.”  Cindy said.<br />
<br />
“You do.  But that&#39;s just because you&#39;ve found a positive way to channel those urges.  But you are a fighter, your mother even said so.”<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded.  “But how can I fight..like this?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, as a tiny, weak, helpless girl?  Didn&#39;t you save that boy Devon?  And stand up to your father?  Tell me.  If he&#39;d killed you, would you care, as long as Alison and your mother were safe?”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s different.  I&#39;d go to Hell and become a demon, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh it&#39;s true.  But you weren&#39;t thinking about that in the moment.  There is something inside you that you are afraid of.  Do you know what that is?”<br />
<br />
Cindy shook her head no.<br />
<br />
“Your father.  The anger, the hatred, they are a part of you.  You&#39;ve had bigoted, hateful thoughts, but you despise that part of yourself, so you keep it locked away.  Until it&#39;s time to fight.”<br />
<br />
Cindy cried out.  “No!  I&#39;m not like him!  I&#39;m not!”<br />
<br />
“You yourself believe your father has good in him.  Few people are wholly good or evil.  He was lured down a dark path.  But then, one day, salvation came.  You looked at your sister, an innocent baby, and decided you would protect her.  Use those dark impulses to keep her safe.<br />
<br />
Keep her safe from him.  From becoming like him.”<br />
<br />
“I couldn&#39;t though.  She would have killed him to save me....save us.”<br />
<br />
“Is that a surprise?  She is just like you.  In fact, she looks up to you, you are her hero.  Of course she wants to be like her big sister.  I bet if we took a peek inside her heart, we&#39;d find a shrine to you.”<br />
<br />
Cindy shivered.  “You make it sound like she loves...that she&#39;s in love with me.”<br />
<br />
“Of course she is!  When you were a boy, you ruined her for other men!  It&#39;s lucky for her that she also has feelings for girls.  Of course, that also means...”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit.  Are you saying that Alison would want to...no, it&#39;s not right.”<br />
<br />
She lightly smacked Cindy on her forehead.  “You idiot.  God created Adam and Eve.  They had three sons.  Abel died, Caine was cast out, and Seth married and his descendants spread across the globe.  Where do you think Seth&#39;s wives came from?”<br />
<br />
“Wait...you mean...his sisters?!”<br />
<br />
“Or even his Mother.  I mean, there were other women on Earth.  Caine encountered other humans in the lands east of Eden, but yes.”<br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t that...I mean...inbreeding?”<br />
<br />
“Eh.  Adam and Eve were perfect.  Even on a genetic level.  They could interbreed with their own offspring with no repercussions.  They were also very long-lived.  Over time, however, humans became less divine and more...mortal.  Taboos about incest were created when it was noted that too much interbreeding was harmful.<br />
<br />
But you and Alison are girls.  Without intervention, it&#39;s not like you could get each other pregnant.”  Lee explained.<br />
<br />
“Intervention?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes.  I mean, I could arrange it, if you wanted.”  Lee grinned, and kissed Cindy.<br />
<br />
“Are you saying I should...?”<br />
<br />
“Have sex with your sister?  Why not, if that&#39;s what she wants?  She&#39;s going to have sex with someone, I mean, she&#39;s already shown she&#39;s attracted to myself and Winrya.  Would you be worse than a demon?”<br />
<br />
“You wouldn&#39;t...would you?”<br />
<br />
“I totally would if she came to me.  I find you and your sister to be quite intriguing.  But that&#39;s just sex.  If she wants more, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d be a good match.  I was created to love God, and have been without that love for a long time.  <br />
<br />
Now Winrya, she has a caring nature.  She&#39;s naturally fond of your sister, but she loves another.”<br />
<br />
Cindy looked into Lee&#39;s eyes.  “She loves you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes she does.  From her perspective, I saved her from a life of misery.  I don&#39;t feel the same way, but I&#39;m not cruel or heartless.  I will give her as much love as I can.”  She sighed.<br />
<br />
“I wish my kind could love as easily as humans.  But it&#39;s a rare blessing.”<br />
<br />
“So what do I mean to you?  Honestly?”<br />
<br />
“Well you&#39;re more than a screwdriver, I assure you.”<br />
<br />
“What?”  Cindy blinked.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I had an encounter with an Angel earlier.  Once, we were siblings.  But she&#39;s hurting badly, and feels she&#39;s nothing more than a tool to God.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s terrible.”  Cindy frowned.<br />
<br />
“It is, and I find I want to help her, despite the fact we are enemies now.  I&#39;m just not sure what I can do.  But I will never treat you that way.  What are you to me?  Loyal.  Devoted.  Fierce.  Caring.<br />
<br />
I will make you one of my champions.  And if you want it, one of my consorts.  I can&#39;t promise you love, but I do care.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.”<br />
<br />
“You are quite welcome.  Now, do you want me to take your virginity, or just do something about that dull ache inside you?”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
“Uh...is it important, being a virgin?”<br />
<br />
“Not really.  Some associate it with purity, but I&#39;ve met girls who&#39;ve broken their hymen for reasons that had nothing to do with sex.  It honestly hurts like a bitch, but it&#39;s a natural barrier against pregnancy.  So I suppose it&#39;s a milestone on the road to becoming a woman.”<br />
<br />
Cindy looked nervous and afraid, but despite a quaver in her voice, she sounded sure when she spoke.  “You promised to make me a woman.  Please finish the job.”<br />
<br />
Lee smiled and pulled the girl close...</p>
