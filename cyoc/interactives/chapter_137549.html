<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually, as Al Roker&#39;s summary presentation had drawn to a close, the film crew cued for me and Molly to head up onstage alongside Savannah Guthrie, Carson Daly, and Al Roker. Fortunately for Molly, NBC made sure that she was given a proper-sized seat to sit in, which was obviously built out of Titanium as well. <br />
<br />
Molly sat adjacent to Carson Daly and Al Roker, with me sitting in another seat alongside her, just as Roker&#39;s presentation had ended, and the screens resumed filming the hosts of the Today show. From there, this prompted Savannah Guthrie to speak, as she did so and said, &quot;Now, that is what I would call a love story! And speaking of Ms. Rhoer, she and her boyfriend have personally flown all the way from the Avery Family Estate to Manhattan for this occasion. Ladies and gentlemen: Give a round of applause for the one and only Molly Rhoer!&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Savannah had finished talking, the cameras zoomed out to show me and Molly sitting alongside her, Carson Daly, and Al Roker, giving her a round of applause, along with the dozens of people outside of Studio 1A (The studio where the Today is filmed at). <br />
<br />
In response to such appraisal, Molly bowed a little before returning to sitting upright in the reinforced chair she sat on, as Molly then spoke with a surprisingly amount of self-confidence while she answered, &quot;Thank you so much for that, Mrs. Guthrie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;*chuckle* Please, call me Savannah. After all, you&#39;re our guest.&quot; Savannah retorted, putting Molly at ease, allowing her to loosen up a little, despite Molly attempting to appear professional during the interview. Then, Carson Daly spoke toward me and Molly as he stated, &quot;Though, gotta admit, Ms. Rhoer: Your story has certainly inspired many people who feel uncomfortable with their appearances, especially for those who are still in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously, much to my surprise, Molly was taking the interview in strides, as she giggled a bit from Carson&#39;s retort, then calmly spoke toward him and replied, &quot;*giggle* Yeah, it felt nice to be an inspiration for so many people, Mr. Daly- I mean, Carson. And please, call me Molly. After all, I&#39;m calling you and Savannah by your first names.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;*chuckle* Well, when you put it like that, Molly: We&#39;re all friends here in Studio 1A.&quot; Roker chirped, just as the three hosts then began to slowly interview Molly as to avoid making her feel uncomfortable, as I saw Savannah clearing her throat a little then said, &quot;*ahem* Anyway, we&#39;re glad that both you and your boyfriend are able to visit us here in-person. However, over four months ago, you initially declined to be interviewed on WPXI Channel 11 News due to your current state. So, why accept being interviewed now, Molly?&quot; <br />
<br />
Of course, being the protective boyfriend that I was, I subtly gestured Molly that she didn&#39;t have to answer that question if she didn&#39;t want to. However, she gave me that determined look in her sapphire blue eyes, so obviously I wasn&#39;t going to stop her. From there, Molly exhaled a deep sigh, then spoke toward Savannah Guthrie and explained, &quot;...Well, to be perfectly honest, Savannah... I wasn&#39;t exactly in the most stable mood when I was offered to be interviewed by WPXI. I mean, this was occurring a short week after my parents...disowned me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...Of course, dear. We perfectly understand your situation. It must&#39;ve hit you pretty hard when your mother and father did such an awful thing when you needed them the most.&quot; Savannah said, being very sympathetic toward what Molly had to endure during a viciously tumultuous time in her life, as Carson Daly and Al Roker, along with the audience began to emit these sympathetic &quot;Awws&quot; toward Molly. <br />
<br />
Of course, Molly was thankful for everyone&#39;s sympathy, as she soon perked back up to a more positive state of mind, where she then replied, &quot;Thank you for the sympathy, Savannah. But don&#39;t worry, I eventually cut ties with my parents a month after I moved in with (Name)&#39;s family. He and his family were very supportive to me. Heck, they even made sure I was given the best care they can hire.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we can definitely see that from how confident you are, given what you had to go through.&quot; Roker remarked, as the technicians backstage pulled up a compilation of photos of Molly being examined by numerous professional medical practitioners and scientists onscreen as he said so. <br />
<br />
Of course, Molly soon spoke up and said, &quot;*giggle* Well, I wouldn&#39;t be here talking with you all if it weren&#39;t for my boyfriend, Al. I&#39;ll let him explain a little.&quot; Obviously, upon hearing me being mentioned by my bovine girlfriend, I soon spoke toward the Today show hosts and explained, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not gonna sugarcoat it, but we initially had some major difficulty finding the right people who could actually help Molly, especially since a few of the initial people we went to see were in complete shock and disbelief when they first saw Molly. In fact, the first person my parents had over to examine Molly was a geneticist and, well... Let&#39;s just say he fainted on the spot when he saw Molly make her way into the Living Room.&quot; <br />
<br />
Obviously, all three hosts had a light chuckle on that remark, obviously imagining the geneticist&#39;s reaction upon seeing Molly for the very first time, where Carson then spoke toward me and retorted, &quot;*chuckle* Well, we can definitely see why you two had trouble at first, (Name).&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, right? Thankfully, my family and I eventually found some help in the form of Dr. Alice Swann. She contacted my parents just after that news report on Molly went live on Channel 11 News. Besides me, she was able to help Molly psychologically recover from what happened between her and her parents.&quot; You commented, recapping on what had transpired while Molly was deeply upset regarding being disowned by her parents. <br />
<br />
Of course, Savannah soon brought up something related to what happened with Molly&#39;s parents, as she spoke toward me and asked, &quot;Though, from what I understand, you were pretty angry with what Mr. and Mrs. Rhoer did to your girlfriend.&quot; &quot;...Yeah, pretty angry was definitely an understatement, Savannah. I mean, I was more than just angry, I was well enraged by what they did, so much so I angrily started to beat up Molly&#39;s father for what he said about her. Thankfully, Mr. and Mrs. Rhoer didn&#39;t press charges against me, since they wanted to cut any and all ties to Molly.&quot; I answered, scratching the back of my head a little in response, obviously a bit ashamed of letting Molly&#39;s parents getting to me like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lord, that&#39;s absolutely horrible!&quot; Al retorted, obviously appalled by what Molly&#39;s parents had done, as Molly then spoke up and replied, &quot;*sigh* Yeah, it certainly was, Al. Though, I think (Name) knew it would be best if I didn&#39;t live with my parents from that point on, especially after the way they treated me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it certainly was effective, considering how you&#39;re now here talking with us, Molly.&quot; Savannah said, reassuring Molly that she had come a long way since she had been transformed into a Human-Cow hybrid. From there, Carson soon spoke toward Molly and commented, &quot;...Plus, you&#39;ve become a very high-profile topic across social media, Molly. For example, we have several long tweets on Twitter from someone named &quot;MollyHeiferFanClub&quot;, who say this: &quot;Out of the many tragic stories I&#39;ve read on the news, #MollyHeifer is definitely the most tragic but hopeful out of them. She was taken by a bunch of carnies who worked for a criminal fugitive named Eugene Changes (if that&#39;s even his real name), drugged and injected with some chemicals, transformed into a 7 and a half foot, half ton Human-Cow hybrid, and to make things worse, her own parents disowned her. Her own parents! And yet, her boyfriend, (Name) Avery, still continued to be with her after she had transformed, trying to keep her happy through thick and thin. Now THAT is pure romance and devotion if I do say so myself! #MollyHeifer, if you ever get this tweet, we just wanna let you know that you&#39;re an inspiration to many, and don&#39;t stop fighting for a pursuit at true happiness.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
To say that Molly and I were surprised was certainly an understatement. After all, the tweet that this guy had sent gained a massive following, which included 5,520 likes and over 560 retweets on Twitter. Anyway, we soon regained our composure, as Molly then looked at the camera and said, &quot;...Wow. This is... I-I honestly don&#39;t know what to say other than thank you, MollyHeiferFanClub. I mean, this is really heartfelting for me after all I&#39;ve been through for half a year.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;*chuckle* You heard it here, folks! Molly certainly has gained some admirers thanks to this one individual. And coming up after the break, we&#39;ll be continuing our interview with guest stars Molly Rhoer and (Name) Avery.&quot; Savannah quipped, as the camera stopped rolling, thus allowing us to take a short reprieve before continuing with the interview.</p>
