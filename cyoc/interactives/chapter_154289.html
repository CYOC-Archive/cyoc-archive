<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I have been eyeing this chapter for a while now, and it is definitely interesting to write! I had fun. Now, the next chapter is in the works, but this chapter is free for ALL!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You couldn’t feel the walls of the sac around you at all, as if the egg suddenly expanded the moment you were submerged within the pink latex. Your sight was limited by the pink fog, barely able to see what was around you within your arm’s reach. The feeling of suspension makes you feel like this sac was the exact replica of a sensory deprivation chamber, meant to break someone’s mind!<br />
<br />
No matter where you swim, the feeling of progression was not felt. The fog stayed put, and the liquid feeling all around your body didn’t seem to flow at all. It felt like you’re stuck in place, given freedom of movement yet confined to this… area.<br />
<br />
So you stop struggling uselessly…<br />
<br />
And begin to think.<br />
<br />
Time seemed to be frozen, in this pink fog void suspending you in this state. Nothing seemed to happen grating on you as anxiousness builds up within. You’d never be in this problem had you didn’t bother with the latex creature! You could have left it all to the police, call them and they would have stormed the nest no matter the ridicule of lunacy you would have garnered from them!<br />
<br />
Part of you argues that these things needed to be stopped now! <br />
<br />
That you could have handled it!<br />
<br />
But it was too big of a problem for you, a mere human.<br />
<br />
Look at what your overconfidence brought you!<br />
<br />
Calm down!<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Focus Yourself!<br />
<br />
Because as if it sensed your growing panic, the latex had shifted, the fog moving around you. The dark pink fog obscuring your vision of the walls gradually changed hues, becoming darker in color. Soon, pitch darkness surrounded you, the only source of light was the unknown source of light directly over your head, creating a halo of luminescence around you.<br />
<br />
The sensation of what was once liquid latex turned murkier and thicker, your body becoming increasingly restricted as your body felt like it was treading molasses. Any attempts at moving become tiring, and you couldn’t help but pant in exhaustion in the thick liquid you knew you were submerged in, caressing your form completely.<br />
<br />
A sensation of movement catches your attention as something fast whizzes around you as if a massive eel was swimming circles. You follow the sensation, trying to ascertain what it was. It was an unknown in this unknown place, rapidly moving around you. <br />
<br />
Getting dizzier and more exhausted at trying to follow the source, you instead brace yourself. Whatever this was, it isn’t friendly. <br />
<br />
“GAH!”<br />
<br />
A scream tore itself out of your mouth as something bashed into your entire left leg, the phantom pain of your leg getting torn off was insane! A quick glance to your leg causes you to panic to see that even in the light, your left leg was gone!<br />
<br />
You grasp at where the appendage once was and despite the lingering pain, you could feel your leg! <br />
<br />
It was still there!<br />
<br />
But something feels wrong. It felt rubbery, and thicker too. You could feel the packed muscles underneath the latex skin you knew you now had. This was dangerous!<br />
<br />
Another movement caught your attention and a quick dodge was all you could do, yet the thick latex surrounding you slowed your movement as it slammed into your right arm! Again, your eyes couldn’t see your now lost appendage, but the feeling of the arm was still there!<br />
<br />
Grasping the now changed arm told you that it was definitely bigger, your left arm feeling up the changed appendage. The nicks of the something sharp on your palm when you made a fist with the changed arm told you that it had sharp claws!<br />
<br />
It was changing you bit by bit, one part at a time!<br />
<br />
You try to swim away, but the fog didn’t move nor did the latex caressing your body! The imbalance of two heavier limbs was throwing you off, and it was causing further exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Your effort was rewarded as the eel slammed into your stomach, knocking your breath out of you. As it retreated, you felt your new thick and strong abs, as if it was making you stronger all around.<br />
<br />
As you recall, every monster you saw, being male, was decently muscular. It was making you into one of them.<br />
<br />
The eel taking another shot slams into your right leg, and the pain shoots up your nerves as you scream in utter pain. Now both of your legs were thick with corded latex muscles and totally unfamiliar to you, the feel of controlling them was thrown out of wack.<br />
<br />
<i>FOCUS!</i><br />
<br />
You stop. You brace yourself.<br />
<br />
You’re not gonna fail here.<br />
<br />
<i>NEVER FALTER!</i><br />
<br />
You brace yourself, legs wide to keep balance.<br />
<br />
The pain as the eel strikes your crotch was blinding, and you scream in utter pain! It was faster now, as the moment you were hunched it struck your butt, the feeling of something foreign connecting to your nervous system.<br />
<br />
You wanted to cry, the pain of your crotch was rapidly dwindling as your new appendage made itself known.<br />
<br />
A tail.<br />
<br />
A quick feel was enough to tell you it’s there. Another slam hits your left arm as it turned to strike you at your chest. You swerve in the liquid, pushed back.<br />
<br />
Only then did you realize that the only human part of you is your head! Using your claws and much more muscular monstrous arms, you brace to protect your head from this eel.<br />
<br />
<i>Wait…</i><br />
<br />
You realized something. The latex didn’t make this space bigger…<br />
<br />
The pain was an illusion. If the latex was so powerful it didn’t need to change one part of you at any time, if it could completely change a person instantly.<br />
<br />
The fog, the unreachable walls.<br />
<br />
The light that shouldn’t even be here.<br />
<br />
<i>You’re in your own damn mindscape!</i><br />
<br />
And it’s being taken over by this latex, aiming to completely erase you!<br />
<br />
<i>You don’t want to be erased!</i><br />
<br />
<i>”An ideal is nothing, until you fight for it!”</i><br />
<br />
Since this was your mind, you felt it coming a mile away. It was a tendril of corruption striking at your psyche, replacing you with its perverted animal version of you. It struck with blinding pain to distract you from the truth.<br />
<br />
All along, you were unconscious in the damn latex sac.<br />
<br />
The eel struck, and with a battle cry, you grasp at it with your clawed hands. You were successful as your mental form grasped at something you couldn’t see.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t an eel, it was a tendril after all. It bucked to push itself closer to the only remaining humanity you are, your head inching closer to the tendril.<br />
<br />
“ARGHHH!”<br />
<br />
<i>You couldn’t fully stop it!</i><br />
<br />
The tendril touched your face as you felt it morph and elongate, more of the tendril inching deeper into your hold, changing your final piece of humanity!<br />
<br />
You buck your arms further away from your face, holding it strong, but you know it in your heart.<br />
<br />
<i>You can’t hold it forever.</i><br />
<br />
The muscles of your arm bulge as the tendril fought back harder, trying to pierce through your head and touch your inner mind, your bedrock personality. The core of your being, and warp it.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t let it. Despite your mental form being completely changed, inside, you, <b>YOU</b>, are still fighting back!<br />
<br />
<b>“I’M NOT GOING TO SURRENDER!”</b><br />
<br />
A sudden tear appeared somewhere far away as light bursts through the fog, the tendril suddenly screeching in pain as the space around you quivered from the interruption. You ripped the tendril apart, the once thick appendage suddenly weak and frail. The pieces you held melted into your hands as the bigger appendage ran away, scared.<br />
<br />
The space around you suddenly became smaller, and you were suddenly hit with the heaviest sense of claustrophobia. You needed to be let out! The walls squished your bigger, muscular body as you reach for the small incision in the suddenly cramped sac you were in.<br />
<br />
You’re awake now! You had to get out!<br />
<br />
The tear was enlarged as your claws ripped it open with you quickly squeezing yourself through the tear.<br />
<br />
<b>FREEDOM!</b><br />
<br />
The cold floor and the splatter of liquid latex meet your ears as you fall face-first onto it, and you knew you were free!<br />
<br />
You look up towards the figure within your sight, and gratitude swells in your heart! <br />
<br />
It’s <i>Steve</i>! With a knife in his hand.<br />
<br />
But his face was filled with distraught.<br />
<br />
Your smile disappears as you look to his face and his retreating form. Disbelief etches itself on your face as you see his scared look.<br />
<br />
You look down.<br />
<br />
To see black claws, attached to thick hands and forearms. You trail it to your black latex biceps and look down to see the form you vaguely felt in that metaphysical space.<br />
<br />
“S-Steve, I’m still here.” <br />
<br />
You plead, looking at his eyes in fear. His hands stopped from reaching the bottle of oil strapped to his belt.<br />
<br />
“I’m still human inside!” <br />
<br />
Tears of joy wanted to fall from your eyes, but you couldn’t, not anymore.</p>
