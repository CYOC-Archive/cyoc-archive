<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessy was practicing shape shifting with Sammy, and it was actually kinda fun that she was more or less his tutor, shape shifting coming so much more regularly to her than to Sammy, though he in turn was better at other kinds of magic. <br />
<br />
Though Jessy had to admit, from everything he&#39;d heard: the imps were vile. The imps had no place in a fairy tale about the world being reborn for good or evil into an age of loving innocence. She hoped that everyone becoming friends would fix the problem and everyone would then get back to being friends and doing what they loved. She didn&#39;t want to think about them, or deal with them anymore than she had to, and that went double for her millions of friends. She hoped they were dealt with as soon as possible, and she and Sammy could get back to exploring this beautiful world.<br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
It was like a zen riddle really. Or the phrase, to have all, one must first desire nothing. Jill couldn&#39;t deny it anymore. She&#39;d tried to escape it, but she couldn&#39;t, even as her body brought her baby out into the world, and she felt the agony of every moment... she couldn&#39;t escape it anymore. Teddy was still Ted. In every possible way that mattered, Teddy was still Ted. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t under mind control. He wasn&#39;t some creature that happened to have Ted&#39;s memories. Teddy was still Ted. As she agonizingly brought new life into the world, Jill simply couldn&#39;t reject the logic anymore. Teddy had come here to be with her during her baby&#39;s birth. He&#39;d promised to try and avoid transforming anyone. He could have reeked havoc once free. Instead... he&#39;d come here... to be with her. <br />
<br />
And... maybe it was delirium from the pain she was in as her child pushed their way out into the world... but knowing that Teddy was still Ted... suddenly... she couldn&#39;t bring herself to be afraid or resistant to the idea of joining him in fur and diapers. Maybe she was breaking under the stress of everything but... now, for right now, she could no longer think of a viable reason to resist anymore... she&#39;d seen the baby furs. After everyone then everything around her had been changed but her and her unborn child. All of them still living their own lives, all of them with their own point of view, hopes and dreams, just... without the weight and pain that people had long ago accepted as the cold hard reality of living. They weren&#39;t soulless or lobotomized dolls, they didn&#39;t need to be cured. If anything the baby furs were the ones offering the cure. As she heard a cry, Jill giggled to herself. <br />
<br />

<br />
Jamie couldn&#39;t believe how silly these non-friends were being. &quot;I told you, a little devil  girl appeared and turned a horsie into a zombie. I think she&#39;s really bad and other people should know about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two guards knew that violence and brute force was useless against a baby fur outside of a spanking, but those dealing with the &#39;furry little zombies&#39; had been stressed to be as humorless as possible, and that meant not humoring any of the rabbit boy&#39;s wild stories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid, we don&#39;t have time for your nonsense.&quot; One of the guards.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t really possible for a baby fur to feel hate, let alone rage, but Jamie did have an odd sense of indigence. Didn&#39;t these not-friends know that Jamie clearly outranked them? Didn&#39;t they see the stripes on his camouflage colored diaper? <br />
<br />
Then Jamie said matter of fact. &quot;I&#39;m not a kid. I&#39;m a kit. Do I look like a baby goat to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jamie The Rabbit had meant what he&#39;d said in all seriousness, but there are few things as humorous and funny as a small child being serious. And it could tickle even the most harsh funny bone. <br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
As Teddy was with his big sister&#39;s birthing, and Jamie was trying to tell the not-friends about the devil girl... Mari The Deer, had a strong need to wander off. <br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t like the baby furs&#39; normal behavior, where they were really obvious for the most part, never actively seeking out to transform others, only &#39;make friends&#39; as being synonymous in their minds with them changing, rather than any active united scheme to conquer the world. If anything, baby furs simply made friends easy. <br />
<br />
This on the other hand, was a need, like salmon had to race up river to their spawning grounds to start the cycle anew or die trying. <br />
<br />
As she wandered... the other doctors and nurses and patients didn&#39;t trip over her or bump into her, like her very presence prevented that from happening, if anything, if anything, her presence in this house of sickness almost left a sense of peace in her wake. <br />
<br />
And where she ended up, surprised even her. It was a wing of the children&#39;s hospital... and while baby furs saw things through the lens of a toddler, Mari still recognized the place for children who were really sick and would soon &#39;go to sleep and not waking up again&#39;. It was like something had drawn her here like a magnet.  She&#39;d given a pinkie promise not to try and make friends with anyone here, and pinkie promises were unbreakable to a baby fur, like laws of physics were to a human being. But... Mari felt a bit conflicted, had she made an earlier Pinkie promise? <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I swear this oath by Apollo the physician, by Aesculapius, by Health, and by all the gods and goddesses: In whatsoever place that I enter I will enter to help the sick and heal the injured, and I will do no harm.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Mari sincerely felt conflicted. Meanwhile, some of the younger patients were wondering (and a few hoping) if Bambi had come to make them better.</p>
