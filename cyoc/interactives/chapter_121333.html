<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deciding that she didn&#39;t want to overdo it on her first time transforming, Kimberly chose to avoid what she considered &#39;drastic&#39; mental and physical changes. Just a few things to spruce up the look, she thought to herself. These changes were all quite exciting, but she had a trip to prepare for, and she doubted that Bimbo Alice would help with her productivity.<br />
<br />
Focusing her efforts on her underskirt and slip, she imagined hands pulling and sculpting them together like clay. The fabric on the bottom of the slip and top of the skirt seemed to split open, and the silky threads began to weave themselves together. The slip soon formed into full but simple white dress underneath her blue one, to provide support and comfort. <br />
<br />
Carefully, sat up and then stood up off her bed, pausing only momentarily as a small wave of those lovely tingles washed over her form.<br />
<br />
Looking herself over, she realized just how small she had become. She liked being a little shorter for a change, but felt that under 5 feet was too short. Yet, Kimberly thought to herself, I don&#39;t want to alter my physical traits quite yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah&quot;, she said aloud, with a snap of her fingers,&quot;I&#39;ve got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning her gaze downward, she focused on her shoes and then closed her eyes. As she began to send her desires through the headband, she felt something shifting. Reopening her eyes, Kimberly saw and felt her heels rising. One, two, three inch heels formed on the shoes, tilting her upwards slightly and tightening her calf muscles. She tried to take a few tentative steps, but found herself wobbling dangerously, nearly tipping over into her dresser. Hmmm, she pondered, deep in thought, if only I could walk more easily in these.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she felt a short, sharp shock of tingles flow out from the headband and down to her toes. She steadied herself against the wall as the tendons in her feet and ankles started tingling intensely, she found herself moaning as her heels lifted themselves up higher. She felt something lock and then the tingles died away. Looking down she saw she was comfortably standing on the balls of her feet, with her heel and ankle lifted somewhat out of her shoes, the straps straining. She tried forcing be ankles back down into her shoes but found that they refused to budge. <br />
<br />
Well this is no good, she thought, how am I supposed to walk like this? Then she felt her shoes tightening again as their forms started to alter. The heels rose up higher, matching the change in her feet and conforming to their shape until they fit perfectly. With the tingles dying down she saw her view raise by about another inch. Inspecting her shoes Kimberly saw the front of the shoe had gained a one inch platform and the heel had received another inch in height as well. Overall this served to raise her back to a respectable 5’5”. <br />
<br />
Kimberly tried again to walk around her room, finding she could walk just as easily in these shoes now as she could in her sneakers. She felt her hips sway more as she moved, she had given herself quite the sultry stride. The altered physiology of her heels and ankles was apparent too. Even just standing there Kimberly felt more comfortable in these new heels than the flats she they had been just a moment ago.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with her shoes, Kimberly focused on her stockings. They were thigh-high, pure white and softer than anything she had ever worn. Deciding the color and texture were fine, the only change she made was to ring the tops with white lace and add a simple black bow onto the back of each, with ribbons that hung down a couple inches. Without peeking beneath her skirts you couldn’t see a change, but the way the lace felt against her thighs when she rubbed them together was quite nice.<br />
<br />
She now looked down at her dress, her mind flying through possible alterations. Her skirts had reached about knee length at this point. Kimberly thought this was a little long for the ‘sexy’ look. She thought about merely shortening them but soon thought of a better option. She closed her eyes tightly and imagined a blue-white flower slowly blooming outwards, an image she pressed through to the headband. Not long after she heard and felt a rustling around her thighs. Opening her eyes, she giggled in delight as she watched her skirts rise up slightly, widening and becoming decidedly poofier. The much wider skirt rings now stopped around mid-thigh. The tips of the ribbons on her stockings now hung down below the skirts’ hems.<br />
<br />
On her torso, Kimberly completed the apron, finishing up the lace edges and having straps reach up and over her shoulders. Her slightly puffy should she rounded out slightly, making their shape sturdier and more spherical, with the holes for her arms comfortably snug around her biceps. The bow on her back that fastened the apron to her waist she made larger, so that the edges reached past her waist and the ribbons down almost to the bottoms of her skirts.<br />
<br />
Looking at the collar of her dress, it had widened a bit more, showing off more of her chest and some enticing cleavage. She widened and dropped it a little lower, to the point where it was slightly too large for her enhanced chest to hold up.<br />
<br />
Alright, she thought to herself gritting her teeth, now it’s time for the finale.</p>
