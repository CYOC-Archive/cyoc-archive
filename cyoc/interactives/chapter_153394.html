<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bradley Follton II was nothing if not a wealthy, well to do, stylish cad.<br />
<br />
He had built up a body and a reputation across a life spent chasing enjoyment and striving to escape from boredom that only the truly financially blessed could find in such a life as his. With the body he had, Brad could well either have become a professional athlete in the high school circuit and then easily gone on to the pro leagues, or even became a physique bodybuilder or model in his twenties...<br />
<br />
Instead, Brad contented himself with flying across the globe in his personal jet and indulging his carnal desires with both men and women both. He&#39;d tell the men he laid with he was gay, and the women that he was straight. In reality, maybe Brad was more the autosexual; there was only one man in the world Brad could love, and he stared a lot at that man every single morning in the mirror.<br />
<br />
This charming Lothario&#39;s wavy blond hair, falsely innocent looking blue eyes, and pale as cream skin might have given an impression that he was somehow not in the know about what he did and its effects on people. But he knew, as could be discerned from his easy and knowing smile. And he would inevitably grow bored with his current love, and trot out some excuse before moving on with his life. No matter what that ultimately entailed for those who knew him.<br />
<br />
It was such a morning as usual for him - Brad spent his mornings in the gym, enjoying the strength and rush of power he felt exerting it. He always worked out in a simple outfit; short shorts and no shirt, all the best to enjoy his reflection, straining and swollen with musculature. Brad never let his body grow hairy, and so meticulously removed any hint of hair so that anyone who saw him would see a peerless, almost statuesque masculine form.<br />
<br />
Yet even so, time followed everyone, even Brad. He was currently 33 years old, and even when there was absolutely no hint of aging having an adverse effect on him, he&#39;d taken to a well regimented steroid plan, use of anti-aging ointment and hairline restoring shampoo for his hair in the shower. There was no expense too far for his vanity.<br />
<br />
He was interrupted in the course of getting done with his usual skullcrushers by a somewhat older gym goer, &quot;Excuse me, young man, do you think you could---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spot you? Listen old man, I saw you scoping me out for ten minutes before you made the approach,&quot; Brad said with a casual sneer, &quot;I know you&#39;re checking me out. Hell, half the gym probably is.&quot; He did a vain flex right there in front of the older man, and watched with growing joy as he saw the older man seeming to really get into the show.<br />
<br />
His eyes darted across Brad&#39;s body, and Brad could basically see the guy making eyes like he was undressing Brad mentally. Brad suppressed a scowl when he saw the older guy was visibly hard in his shorts. Time to break his heart. &quot;...But I&#39;m not up for fooling around with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...but you just---&quot; The older guy started, and Brad chuckled and cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only fuck people whose aesthetic appeals to me, and yours? Yours doesn&#39;t. So run along and take care of your boner, you old queer.&quot; He returned to his exercises, watching the older guy trot off, dejected and visibly more than a little destroyed. This was just a normal day for Brad.<br />
<br />
However, he didn&#39;t know he was watched.<br />
<br />
Two people, one a visibly scarred young woman and another a handsome twenty something with dyed, peroxide blond hair, watched the scene unfold from the machines area of the gym - Brad as usual was a domineering brute with the free weights area. Both knew him well enough to know that was the case. The woman was Kathleen Dubois, a French woman who had been a dalliance to Brad during his trip to Paris...and it was in trying to keep his interest and continue having sex with him that she got those scars; the result of botched plastic surgery.<br />
<br />
The man was Toby Landon, a young former model who had been a gay hookup of Brad&#39;s on his trip to New York City. Toby hadn&#39;t identified as gay, hell, he still wasn&#39;t sure in his heart of hearts, but he was taken in by Brad&#39;s overwhelming confidence and sexual ease, and ultimately wound up discovering definitely a gay side to himself; he&#39;d discovered he enjoyed sex with men almost as much or even slightly more than sex with women. But then Toby lost Brad&#39;s interest and he had been abandoned to deal with a series of outstanding circumstances.<br />
<br />
And both were here, now, in the hotel Brad was staying at to finally engage in their revenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Toby said, crossing his arms, &quot;That this...this curse nonsense is going to actually DO something to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not gonna face consequences otherwise, Toby.&quot; Kathleen put an arm around Toby and he didn&#39;t exactly shrink away from her, but he did take a moment out of their plan;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Don&#39;t make this weird, Kathleen. You know I&#39;m gay...&quot; Toby muttered to himself, trying to tell himself he was gay to avoid the reality that even scarred up, Kathleen still turned him on like fuck. In the course of their heady plans for revenge, he had developed quite the interest in her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Toby, whatever you want to tell yourself,&quot; Kathleen said and then held up a box, &quot;Now, are you in this or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah. Fuck Brad. Just...fuck him.&quot; Toby said, glaring at the oblivious rich heir continuing his workout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Kathleen said and held aloft the box, pointing what looked like an odd design featuring two serpents on the front right at Brad, &quot;...picture all your grievance, Toby, and then we&#39;re going to send our grief right at him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toby pictured all the strife that had happened, and brought up all his dark feelings, and could tell by the look on Kathleen&#39;s face she was doing so as well.<br />
<br />
The box suddenly flew open and the machines room went cold, quiet, and something the vengeful duo could not see surged out of it in response to the urging provided by their negative emotions, and even more, the amount of justified darkness aimed at Brad.<br />
<br />
The box held a spirit of ironic punishment, which would attach itself to Brad and begin changing and altering him over time, as a karmic transformation for all his misdeeds. All that was needed now from Toby and Kathleen was for them to guide the spirit via the box it was attached to. So long as the box existed, the transformation would continue.<br />
<br />
Toby and Kathleen felt the room get warm again, and Toby pondered why nobody found their activity odd. Well, he decided, best not look THAT gift horse in the mouth.<br />
<br />
Toby asked Kathleen, &quot;So...if you told me right, now we can guide the spirit-thing by the box. What&#39;re we gonna do to Brad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathleen cleared her throat and responded, &quot;We&#39;re going to...&quot;</p>
