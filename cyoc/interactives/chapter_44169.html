<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>The beast that lived within Eric's subconscious mind controlled his conscious mind, and his old conscious mind became his subconscious. The beast stood there a moment, enjoying his release after all the time it had been trapped. It wanted to use it's new found freedom, but to what ends was uncertain. Something in the beast knew that it needed packmates, it needed a family to belong to and the feral nature would have it no matter what. Searching within itself, the beast that controlled Eric knew that there were others in that house and they would all be the best candidates.</Br>
<Br>Still standing where he had transformed, Eric the werewolf sniffed the air deeply, getting every smell possible in it's nostrils and realized that they were all scattered about the house. Sniffing again, he could smell Mike's scent the strongest and the beast knew that Mike was his first mark. Dropping to all fours, since that would be the fastest way to move around, Eric bolted through the door that was closed and raced to take Mike's humanity first.</Br>
<Br>Unsuspecting of what was going on at the moment, being freaked out by that loud howl he heard just a few moments ago, Mike cautiously made his way through the dark house, with his flashlight lighting his way. Every step that Mike made was a precise one, not certain of anything at that moment and even jumped at the floor boards creaking underneath his footsteps. There was no telling what dangers lurked ahead of him in the dark and Mike wanted to keep up on everything around him.</Br>
<Br>Running through the house, using the secret passage ways that the werewolf could see with his keener senses, he knew that Mike was close. Slowing, then standing at a dead stop, Eric sniffed the air again and knew that his unsuspecting victim was just on the other side of the wall. Slowly and silently, the werewolf moved to the next opening in the wall, then opened the secret entrance.</Br>
<Br>Mike, in hearing the noise of a sliding door or something, stopped right where he was. Not sure of what he should do, Mike called out in the darkness... no reply. Thinking it was all a bit of his imagination playing tricks on him, making Mike think that there was something out there to get him, he continued further down the hall. Suddenly, Mike stopped again, then listened to make sure he really was hearing something. In what should have been complete silence, Mike heard the sound of deep breathing. A deep breath in slowly through some creature's nostrils, then a sharp and elongated exhale through the same nostrils. Mike called out again, this time stuttering a bit in his fear of the unknown. Again, there was no reply while the breathing continued. Wanting to know what lurked ahead, Mike shone the light down the hall and stopped as he saw the light reflect off of a creature's eyes. He could not see anything about the creature, other than it's now amber hue and seemingly glowing eyes while the light continued to reflect off of them. Not sure of what was ahead, Mike took a slow step forward and the light revealed just a bit more of the creature before him. From what Mike could see, it was a large animal of some kind from just being able to see the muzzle alone. Then, as if out of nowhere, the eyes went away and all Mike could see now was a dark colored fur. Not sure of anything now, Mike stepped back slowly without making a sound, but yet there was a creak after his step. Mike made another, this time the creak came faster after the step, which meant this creature was getting closer to him. Suddenly lightning flashed brightly in the sky, illuminating the entire hallway and Mike saw the entirety of the creature. Eyes wide and frozen in total fear, Mike saw what looked to be a mixture of a wolf and man. Mike then realized what was before him now, was a real live werewolf and Mike was it's prey.</Br>
<Br>Mike tried to think of something to do, but his body was still frozen with fear, while all of his brain's commands to flee to save his life were in vain. Something in him prevented him from running and the odd part was... a part of him wanted to know more. Something in him wanted the werewolf to come near him so he could marvel in the beast's form. The thought was new, foreign and completely irrational, but nonetheless... it was there and it wanted to be sated. Intrigued by this creature not running, Eric the werewolf came up closer to Mike and sniffed the air around him. Smelling that this was the creature it first set out to find, the werewolf howled loudly, which made Mike jump, but not move otherwise. Eric snarled a bit, showing off his sharp fangs then snapped, biting Mike swiftly with Mike never even able to see it coming. Eric the werewolf stepped back, blood covering his maw and teeth, then haunched down and waited. Something in the werewolf knew that it wouldn't take long for Mike to change into relatively the same creature that he was. Within minutes of the bite, Mike could see just as clearly in the dark as Eric could. Then his body was racked with pain, his body changing shape and adding massive amounts of mass, which pushed the clothes to their limits and fell to the floor in tattered rags. As soon as Mike the werewolf had finished changing, the old Mike was pushed into the new subconscious. Sniffing one another, recognizing that they were brothers now, the two threw their heads back and howled.</Br>
<Br>Now there were two of a kind, soon to be five. Each sniffed the air, finding their new targets. Johnny was not far from where Mike the werewolf stood now and without any hesitation, Mike bolted off in Johnny's direction. Growling, knowing that the closer prey was now spoken for, Eric sniffed and found that Sei was farther away from Ryan. Bolting off down the hallway, Eric the werewolf went after Ryan.</Br></p>
