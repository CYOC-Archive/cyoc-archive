<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blinding slats of sunlight woke Mika the next morning. He rubbed his eyes and saw that Tobias was already up and munching on a loaf of bread. &quot;Want some?&quot; he tore out a chunk and passed it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Mika said as he wolfed down the food.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you cast that spell yesterday?&quot; Tobias asked. &quot;You have a magic ring or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I used to be a wizard&#39;s apprentice. The innkeeper turned me into a stableboy so he could use my magic to change others into horses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tobias nodded, seeming to understand, and his eyes grew distant. &quot;You know, I was once a noble prince. One day I was dashing thru a small village when an old women came forward begging for food. I was in a real big hurry so I just pushed her aside, but unfortunately she was a powerful witch, and in retaliation she regressed me into a helpless little boy and made me her slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m real sorry. How long ago was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven years.&quot; Mika&#39;s eyes widened as Tobias&#39; voice started to tremble slightly. &quot;You know, I&#39;m pretty tough, and I tell myself that I can deal with anything. But with each passing year, I feel a piece of my mind fading away, and sometimes I just want to kill myself and end this daily torment...&quot; Tears started welling up in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa dude! You calm down okay?&quot; Mika leapt to his feet and clumsily put his arm around Tobias&#39; shoulder, doing his best to comfort him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a wizard right? Can&#39;t you change me back?&quot; Tobias looked at him hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t right now. Becoming a stableboy messed up my mind, and I can only remember that one spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your teacher? He can change us both back, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but he lives in Arlor. That&#39;s days of walking away, and besides I don&#39;t know how to get there, and he may not even be at home.&quot; Mika  cursed himself for having left all the trip planning & navigation to Audrey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I know exactly how to get to Arlor.&quot; Tobias said confidently. &quot;If you turn me into a horse, I can carry you there before sundown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t our master and mistress come after us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance. Every time they get together, they&#39;ll get drunk and sleep late into the day. We&#39;ll be in Arlor before they even discover that we&#39;re gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?!&quot; Tobias snapped. &quot;Do you want to be stuck mucking out stables for the rest of your life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika looked sheepishly at him. &quot;It&#39;s not that. You know I said I can only cast one spell? So if we can&#39;t find my teacher to turn you back, or we get separated, you could be stuck as a horse forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine with that. You know, back in my castle we had a roomful of paintings of the noble steeds that carried my ancestors to victory. I&#39;ve always wondered what being a powerful horse would be like. Besides, I know you&#39;ll take good care of me, right?&quot; he gave Mika a warm smile and a friendly nudge on his ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now will you quit wasting time?&quot; Tobias strode to the center of the sun dappled stable and dropped down on all fours. &quot;Do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika took a deep breath and focused. Tobias&#39; fingers began to ache. He watched as they lengthened, merging into a single fore finger longer than the rest which swelled at the tip. The nails turned black, and soon formed themselves into hooves. His feet started to fuse too, and a deep chestnut stubble started to creep from his hooves up his arms and legs, gradually thickening and covering his skin.<br />
<br />
The changes accelerated as his arms lengthened until they matched his legs, followed by all four limbs continuing to grow, bones stretching and adjusting to his huge torso that was rapidly barreling out. A surge of heat and strength pulsed through his body, and he shook himself in pleasure as muscles rippled and grew. <br />
<br />
His spine started letting out a series of loud cracks, as he felt his head rising up and his neck thicken and lengthen. His torso, now fully covered with chestnut brown hair, became longer, and his spine pushed out from just above his now massive rear end, emerging as a glossy black horse tail. <br />
<br />
Tobais&#39; last human features faded away as his nose and upper lip fused together and forced their way out from his face.  His lower lip and jaw soon followed, merging into a muzzle that continued to grow. His black hair started to get longer as it spread down his neck forming into a lush mane. A single line of white fur sprouted down his snout, and his ears grew long and pointed, moving up to the top of his head. His lone earing slipped off and fell to the ground. In the middle of the stable now stood a magnificent chestnut stallion more than 6 feet tall. Tobais looked at himself and let out a satisfied neigh.<br />
<br />
Mika hurriedly dressed and picked up a small bag of provisions. He placed a saddle on Tobias and led him to the edge of the village. After several awkward moments of trying and failing to mount the great stallion, Tobias rolled his eyes and bent down, allowing Mika to clamber on. <br />
<br />
Starting with a quick trot, Tobias gradually accelerated to a full gallop. Weather-beaten cottages with gardens peopled by peasants hefting spades and axes flew past in a blur, and eventually disappeared as they left the village far behind. <br />
<br />
They plunged through a wide and windswept land of meadows and fields. Formations of geese scratched the slate sky above. A river foamed ahead, and Tobais hugged its banks as it meandered lazily, lapping past the crumbling hulks of ruined castles high above. <br />
<br />
The sun was running high when they reached the borders of an ancient forest where the road ended. Mika absently nibbled at an apple as they pressed on thru, enveloped by the sweetness of resin and the coolness of pines. Now and then a pool of sunlight filtered thru the canopy.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, the trees abruptly ended and a new landscape opened up. The ground fell away towards snow-capped mountains, and below the city of Arlor sprawled across a beige-colored plain, a hive of pastel arches, pillars and balconies.<br />
<br />
Mika was staring distractedly at the city, trying to make out the wizards&#39; quarter, when a massive fireball erupted from behind a boulder, narrowly missing them. Tobias reared in alarm and nearly threw Mika off. Looking around, they found themselves surrounded by three stocky, brutal-looking bandits, weapons raised and ready. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a little runt like you doing with such a fine beast?&quot; the leader leered in disdain. &quot;You&#39;ll fetch us a nice price down in the market.&quot; he smirked at Tobias as the group advanced menacingly on them.</p>
