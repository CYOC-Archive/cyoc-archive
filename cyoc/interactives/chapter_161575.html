<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Joe&#39;s family finally having settled down in heaven, and with them and Stew&#39;s Earth&#39;s version of them going &quot;Don&#39;t care about meeting them.&quot; Ty felt like it was time to open up Heaven, and as such he started letting everyone in the purgatory experience heaven. There were a few issues here and there, but it was easy to accept when Ty fully explained &quot;Here in Heaven you will want for nothing, but if you want any new media or innovations either take some from Earth or create it yourself.&quot; or basically watch earth if you are bored or make something yourself. With the gates to Heaven opening Ty also let Dustin in. He was a man for most of his life, and when he entered heaven he looked much as he did right before. A long white beard, bald, and looking a bit like a wizard with his walking stick and robes. <br />
Ty said &quot;Glad to finally see you, and that you decided to tell everyone about the boob thing when we first started.&quot; <br />
Dustin chuckled and said &quot;Ah, that was when my feeling of freedom and ease picked up. However now I&#39;m kinda glad I&#39;m done with being a Priest... Although I&#39;d imagine i&#39;ll be popular up here for a long time.&quot; <br />
Ty nodded at his appreciation for his once step-brother. Hopefully soon his mind would acclimate and he would turn himself into a young man again... or maybe not, he may enjoy keeping his last earthly appearance... just without the arthritis and hunch. <br />
<br />
Many years had passed, countless generations were cycling into Heaven, and Ty governed the world without direct messages. It&#39;s just when he was happy with someone and they prayed he gave generously. When he was mad with someone and they prayed either he gave them nothing or twisted their wishes. Which gave people odd interpretations of what Ty did and didn&#39;t want. Most of which Ty didn&#39;t really care about but didn&#39;t bother correcting as he found a lot of them amusing. Then one day Ty was wondering how Joe and his family were doing. His subconsciousness dealt with so much and he figured it may be nice to peak in on his once beta testers. <br />
Ty helped himself into their little slice of heaven and said &quot;Hey, been awhile since proper me was with you all.&quot; Then saw that most of them were out of the house. Everyone who was there was a mature Victoria and a little girl with her. <br />
<br />
Victoria said &quot;Ty, sorry that Dad and the Moms are out. Now little miss Tylie you know what to say.&quot; <br />
The little 6 year old looking girl looked much like her mother did as a little girl and wore a plain white dress, she said &quot;Hello Lord Ty.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty said &quot;Why hello there little Tylie. Mind if I waited here for the rest to come? I was feeling like reminiscing about the past.&quot; Meanwhile Ty was wondering when his subconscious allowed children to be born in Heaven? Was she natural or... &quot;Say Victoria, do you have a husband or partner?&quot; <br />
Victoria blushed a little and said &quot;No, just a... little wish... My perfect little angel.&quot; Yep to Victoria she was a little darling, but Ty could see she was just as real as the people on earth. <br />
Tylie looking at Ty asked &quot;Lord Ty... Could I go to Earth?&quot; <br />
Victoria and Ty&#39;s eyes widened and Victoria said &quot;Oh this little kidder, probably a little jealous that dad and Julia had real earth and mom and I had that continuation with simulated earth that you let run for a few more years.&quot; <br />
Ty asked &quot;How old are you Tylie?&quot;<br />
Tylie said &quot;I&#39;m 6 years old!&quot; <br />
Ty stretched his arms and said &quot;You know what? Sure, let&#39;s call this a test run to see if this may be a good idea in the future.&quot; <br />
Victoria looked a little shocked and said &quot;You are not going to Earth little missy! It&#39;s safe here in Heaven, do you even know how dangerous it is on Earth? Your grandfather would&#39;ve been shot to death there!&quot; <br />
Tylie asked &quot;But if I did die there wouldn&#39;t I just come here? And besides Ty loves us all, he&#39;d never let anything bad happen to me.&quot; <br />
Victoria looked to Ty who shrugged and said &quot;If you are going to Earth then I&#39;m not going to protect you from everything. You&#39;ll be lucky and not be in any giant trouble, but you&#39;ll have to face the actual world and all the imperfections that come with it. Got it?&quot;<br />
Tylie smiled her eyes gleaming with excitement in her eyes, but Victoria asked &quot;And what will she do for food, shelter, money?&quot; <br />
Ty said &quot;Oh I&#39;ve got just the perfect idea for that.&quot; <br />
<br />
On earth there was a worn down shack in what was once a pretty nice neighborhood. Now however everything in a five mile radius was blighted and it seemed like nothing good ever happened there. The place where those  two hideous immortal monsters lived. The couple that Ty cursed and Dustin ran away from. The only 2 people aside from Dustin that Ty allowed to remember him as he lived, although no one ever believed them. Ty teleported his conscious self into their shack, and grimaced as he saw their forms. Barely any skin and mangled bones, The couple that had once considered human having their bodies immortal but still allowed to starve and break looked like their very existence was torture. To be fair that was kind of the point, they had made his life a living hell so he may as well give them a living hell. Still when compared to heaven Earth itself was pretty hellish, but may as well make them useful. In Ty&#39;s presence the two forms were indistinguishable from one another and the chitters of their teeth, and gasps of pained breaths would normally be impossible to understand. However Ty was omnipotent and thus could tell the couple were swearing at Ty.  <br />
<br />
Ty asked &quot;Do you want out of this or what?&quot; which got the attention of June and Mark &quot;There is a girl who was born in heaven who was curious about life on Earth. I&#39;ll replenish your bodies with immortality that comes with immortal youth, and turn the blighted area into somewhere nice... Assuming you do a good job taking care of a foster child. Something you failed at doing with me. You&#39;ll still be trapped in the area, but with bodies that don&#39;t hurt to exist in, some actual food and drink, and everything else you could need to help take care of a girl... Well I don&#39;t think you&#39;d ever turn this down.&quot; <br />
June and Mark knew their chattering teeth couldn&#39;t communicate much. Instead they did the best they could to grit their teeth as the sounds of their bones snapping as they attempted to force their bodies into a crooked begging position was enough for anyone to see they were pleading to take in the girl. Ty waved his hand for theatrics and their bodies regenerated as their bones mended, and  actual flesh and hair filled in their once bony forms. The two were gasping and coughing as they could actually breathe properly for once in such a long time. Looking at their bodies their rags were now actual clothes! And the house... Well it was kinda the shitty lower-middle class thing they always had, but it was better than the ruins it had been. June cupped her and felt her body her flesh supple and soft instead of jagged and coarse. Mark himself felt his face as a small beard had started growing, and took a quick look in his pants and grinned as proper testosterone was flowing again. <br />
Ty said &quot;Now when I say be a good Foster Parent I mean be a good one. Don&#39;t just let her do anything she wants, she wanted to come to Earth I say let her experience Earth and all the small inconveniences that come with this imperfect world. If this works out it&#39;s possible you&#39;ll both get more work like this in the future and I&#39;ll have all the more reason to keep you two happy. Screw this up however and I&#39;ll probably make an actual Hell. Understand?&quot;  The couple nodded and then Ty left. <br />
<br />
Mark and June went to their bedroom and started examining everything, and most everything they had before Ty left was there... Ty had came to them in the evening and they decided to go to bed early. Imagining Ty would want to start everything relatively soon... probably in the morning. <br />
June said &quot;So... we&#39;re going to focus and studying on effective parenting techniques?&quot; <br />
Mark nodded and said &quot;Feeling like getting a little action tonight?&quot; June gave Mark a look and Mark said &quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve had a healthy boner in over a thousand years, excuse me if I&#39;m getting a little horny.&quot; <br />
June sighed and said &quot;Sure, after years of agony I feel amazing and a little bit of love may have been just what we needed.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty was prepping Tylie and everyone who would soon need to migrate and open shops and shrines in what was once the 5 mile radius of blight. Meanwhile Victoria and her family not having looked to earth in a long time took a glance and noticed that it was a very different place from when they had lived.</p>
