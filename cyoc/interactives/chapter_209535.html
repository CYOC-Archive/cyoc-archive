<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh set the GPS to Blake&#39;s house and began driving. Blake only lived 10 minutes away but that would be 10 minutes in the direction away from the party meaning after he picks up Blake, it would be a 40 minute drive to the party.<br />
<br />
While driving to Blake&#39;s house, Josh could not seem to get his car seat and mirrors set properly. Every time he thought he had them set properly, he would look up to his rear view mirror to be out of place again. It was really pissing him off. After 10 frustrating minutes, he pulled into Blake&#39;s driveway and honked the car horn, completely out of patience. Blake eventually came running out of his house wearing a full body fur suit of what must be a werewolf while holding the wolf head mask in his hands. As he ran around to the passenger side and hopped in, he apologize profusely, &quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry, I got this new costume and I was having trouble getting it on right with additional cosmetics. I bought some clothes that I tattered to make this look like the wolfman but I must have bought them a few sizes too small and they would not fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh watched as Blake squeezed himself into the passenger seat of his car, taking note that he was only wearing essentially a wolf pattern fur suit, no extra addons to the costume, basically a furry. Blake also did look bigger and more muscular than Josh remembered, &#39;perhaps the costume had built in pads to make Blake look ripped&#39; Josh thought. It did kinda make Blake look really good.<br />
<br />
Blake adjusted his seat and got buckled in, finally he turned to Josh taking notice of his costume finally. &quot;Let me guess, sexy devil, are you gonna try and seduce me?&quot; Blake said in a laugh clearly joking. <br />
<br />
However Josh caught himself gawking at Blake&#39;s physique with his mouth open. Josh snapped out of it, shaking his head and adjusted his mirror again as he prepared to back out of the driveway, the frustration returning. &quot;We&#39;re gonna be late&quot; was Josh&#39;s only response as he began pulling out of the driveway.<br />
<br />
The rest of the drive was in awkward silence. Josh clearly frustrated and Blake not wanting to piss him off. Blake eventually just put his wolf head mask on and staired out the window. However, after about 15 minutes Josh noticed a smell in the air, it was sweet and... kind of arousing. He suddenly felt a dampness between his legs. Josh reached down to see what was going on and that is when he was stunned, his dick seemed to be gone. All of the puzzle pieces began clicking together in his head. Josh slowly turned to Blake, looking him over while Blake just looked out the window, not noticing Josh&#39;s stairs.<br />
<br />
Blake&#39;s costume looked too real, the ears on the mask twitched, the eyes blinked, the fur looked incredibly real, his tail was flapping as it curled next to him, and the most shocking thing of all was between Blake&#39;s legs. There was now furry balls and a dick in a furry sheath with a small red tip sticking out. Josh was pretty sure Blake had not noticed yet. Josh then cautiously asked, &quot;Hey Blake, where did you get that costume?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake turned his anthro wolf head and responded, full mouth moving while he talked confirming Josh&#39;s suspicions. Some place called the &#39;Magic Shop&#39; that was having massive discounts on Halloween consumes. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh heh, funny I did too?&quot; Josh forced a laugh and gulped loudly as the reality set in. A horniness like no other taking over his body. Josh though &#39;If Blake put on the whole costume and became a full werewolf, then that means he must be only half succubus from the waist down... Oh fuck, that means I have a pussy&#39;<br />
<br />
Josh tried to keep his cool but it was getting exponentially harder to focus as Blakes new scent filled his nostrils and he grew hornier than he thought was possible. He found himself staring at Blake&#39;s big balls and thick sheath more than the road. Josh found himself noticeably wet as his morph suit grew damp at his crotch. Josh thought, &#39;I need to pull over to do something about this&#39; That is when he saw Blake&#39;s sheath begin to engorge, and boy was it a sight to see for Josh, whom now found himself extremely attracted to both men and women now instead of just women. Blake&#39;s sheath first began to grow thicker before his red wolf dick began to emerge from the sheath. It wasn&#39;t long before a 12&quot; red wet wolf dick with a large knot at the base was floating freely in Blake&#39;s lap. This is when Blake finally noticed the changes, &quot;Ummm... Josh?&quot; he said in a shaky but deep voice, &quot;I think something is wrong with my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh finally used this as an excuse to stop the car pull over. Without saying a word, Josh turned the car off and jumped out trying to distance himself from Blake hoping it would help with his own horniness. Josh walked about 20 feet off the road and found a big tree to duck behind. He quickly stripped off the thong and then the morph suit. The morph suit at this point had been soiled with how unnaturally wet his pussy had become. This is when Josh began examining his lower half, this feet had become goat hooves and silky fur trailed up to his lower thighs where soft skin continued up the remainder of this thick thighs to a pussy and he now had an ass to rival his girlfriend&#39;s, and his pointed tail flick between his legs with a mind of its own. Josh was shocked and began to reach for his new pussy when he heard Blake suddenly, &quot;Holy shit, I guess my changes aren&#39;t as bad as yours&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh looked up to see a well built anthro wolf with a throbbing erection standing a few feet away from him and standing at least two feet taller than him. &quot;How bad is it?&quot; Josh asked<br />
<br />
&quot;See for yourself&quot; Blake responded as he held up his phone and fumbled with his new hands to take a picture. &quot;Take a look&quot; Blake handed Josh the phone.<br />
<br />
Josh stepped closer, grabbing Blake&#39;s phone looking at the picture. He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes, he looked like a 19 year old twink with a pussy. He was mush shorter, probably only 5&#39;-5&#39;3&quot; now. However his looks were a 15 out 10. He looked like a model that supermodel&#39;s aspire to look like. Maybe it was the horniness finally taking over but he didn&#39;t think it was a bad look either. And standing this close to Blake now was becoming too much.<br />
<br />
Josh dropped Blake&#39;s phone and immediately leaped onto Blake with surprising power. Blake was able to catch Josh in his arms with his new found strength and as the made out Blake eventually found himself on his back, Josh on top. Blake was helpless to resist Josh&#39;s pheromones. Josh ended up mounting Blake&#39;s cock as naturally as it is to breath. Josh was in full control and loved it, the power of his sex was undeniable and he could have Blake do whatever he wanted, but for now, Josh just wanted to fuck hard.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Blake to cum a massive load into Josh&#39;s new pussy. However, Josh&#39;s demonic powers would not let Blake off that easily. Josh kept bouncing up and down on Josh&#39;s massive wolf dick until Josh came, one, two, three, times?? Josh lost track. Eventually Josh was reaching the climax of all climaxes and knew this would be the last one. He gave it his all, he plunged down as hard as he could onto Blake&#39;s dick finally pushing his pussy&#39;s lips around Blake&#39;s knot locking both men together. The pressure of pushing past Blake&#39;s knot is exactly what Josh needed to push him over the edge, as he had the most powerful orgasm yet, he grabbed Blake&#39;s balls and squeezed them lightly, pushing Blake to cum once and for all. Josh felt the churn of semen in Blake&#39;s balls as they engorged and released a final massive load into his pussy, sending him into complete ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Josh collapsed onto Blake&#39;s fluffy chest, the perfect pillow to recover from an orgasm on, and Blake&#39;s muscles all relaxed as the both lay together panting, still knotted together.</p>
