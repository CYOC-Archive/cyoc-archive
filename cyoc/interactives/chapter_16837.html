<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William was actually beginning to find his horse body to be a wonderous place and offering him many new ways of personal enjoyment. He not only had a more sensual male organ but now tickled his rear with a hair tail too. His arms being legs and hands as hoofs were first thought to be a problem, but as he learned to move on all fours his agility changed his mind.<br />
<br />
Pleased with his new ability to express his every lust and desire without anyone considering him wrong, abnormal, or immoral was showing up by him doing as he pleased. He knew all too well that as Megan sat in the livingroom chair his action of licking her privates would have been seen by many to be wrong. Yet being a horse, an animal as such he was reminded that people don't expect stallions to be responsible for their actions.<br />
<br />
Will's sensual delights of having skin that he could flicker and move which was devised for horses to disturb insects that were bothering them from time to time. Even his ears movements were something he felt and enjoyed over the dexterity he knew as being human.<br />
<br />
Walking about the apartment was somewhat confining and Will would often knock over lamps, small tables, and move Megan's many knick knacks about. The equine pangs of being out free and able to run for pleasure or nessesity was building, making him nervous.<br />
<br />
Megan was by this time standing in her bathroom watching the spreading hair and blackening skin which was growing about her body. She had some fear about becoming a horse as did her friend William. Her own human form was one of beauty but the more she felt of, and remembered the wild time with Will her mind changed. <br />
<br />
Deciding at first that being as a horse meant she need not work or even pay off what she owed to so many. Megan could find her life one of relative ease and little work if any at all. Her most sensual self would be able to accept that monster sized cock which Will continued to display as he walked past the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
As for little knowledge Megan had of what and how horses often have to live and are used with bit, bridle, saddle, or harness she still thought it a wonderful way to live.<br />
<br />
It might have been that moment of personal truth when from her tight round butt jutted out the beginiings of a tail. This was not sensual but painful and with every passing minute it grew longer and began to sprout very coarse hairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not fun, you stupid girl!&quot; grumbled Megan now her thoughts changed as she was finding that horses too have pains.<br />
<br />
The pain brought her back to reality and she went into the kitchen to chase a horse away from eating her herb plants. The thought of how this all began was making her female self begin to search through Will's belongings and clothes.<br />
<br />
When Megan found the small bottle she read the name &quot;The Ointment Shop&quot; and then saw a phone number.<br />
<br />
Even as her fingers felt stiff she was able to punch the buttons on her phone. It rang and rang, being the early morning hour it was until there came a faint couch and a hoarse voice.<br />
<br />
Megan told of what happened and asked how, but then was stopped as the proprietor began to explain some of the potions extra properties.<br />
<br />
It seemed that Will had recently been in touching range and having touched some horse's male or female organ. The touching and his own lust made a mental connection making the enhancment potion all the more potent. It was Will's vivid memory of his experience with a horse that pointed the direction which the potion would go. As it does a fine and wonderful job of bringing the purchaser into a new and sensual realtiy, it can also if allowed to maintain more freedom to experience his new form make it permanant as well.<br />
<br />
Megan was told or suggested that she keep Will contained in her apartment, as letting him out would most certainly doom him to remain as a horse.<br />
<br />
The Chinese Proprietor suggested he could send over an antidote for Megan's return to complete humanity. Yet too if she found herself being extra sensual, he could send over a partial remedy. Then there was the price for being delivered out of the hands of such a fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;$500.00 for the complete remedy, or $100.00 for the partial fix!&quot; said the old and wise man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't afford that much, what does the partial remedy do for me?&quot; asked Megan as she wondered if she had that much actual cash about the apartment.<br />
<br />
The old man sighed, &quot;for $100.00 you get to be what you were with the exception of where your horse friend put his self inside your body. That place shall remain much as it is and an area around it will retain the skin texture, color, and what hair has grown within five inches around.&quot; explained the Proprietor.<br />
<br />
Megan thought for a moment and with a stiffening hand she brushed it over her blackened lips of female joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed, but if later can I get the total remedy?&quot; asked Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; came the quick reply, &quot;One remedy to a customer!&quot; stated the old and wise man.<br />
<br />
Megan felt a tear running down her cheek and thought of how and where she might find someone trustworthy enough to get her the extra $400. bucks. She new those with ready money but most also had big and willing mouths to tell all of what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I send my son Baila with both of the remedies, just in case you find some extra cash!&quot; the man said and after taking down Megan's apartment's address he hung the phone up with a slam.<br />
<br />
Will was by this time standing with his front hoofs on the window's sill. His hind legs stretched out long behind and splied apart a bit more than when walking around the apartment.<br />
<br />
Megan, her mind on her own troubles from the potion of will's and what she wished she could afford, she paid him little attention. It was strange but somehow comforting for her to sit or be close to Will as being part horse herself she was a mare in his herd. So plopped in a chair she sat even with his rounded pony belly. Her head down in changing hands she was thinking of who to call when it hit.<br />
<br />
At first she thought there was a leak in the ceiling from the apartment above. Tilting her head up she looked toward the white ceiling. <br />
<br />
Splat, then another and suddenly a flooding gusher of Will's totally changed semen roared out his cock's royal end spewing his load.<br />
<br />
Cum and globs of equine like semen in her hair, in her eyes, over her face and as she yelled in surprise, it went in her mouth. Will the stallion in body and mind was enjoying one of his many times to come, he masturbated himself for relaxation and continued strength where it counts. <br />
<br />
The pungent smell turned Megan off at first but as she sat there a sensation, a passion, a lust to ingest it came over her.<br />
<br />
Seeing through blurried sperm filled eyes the monster cock still wickedly hung there before her she reached out a stiffening hand to pull it her way.<br />
<br />
Falling to her knees Megan took Will's shaft and coaxed it's flarred end into her opened mouth. A little fingering was needed to get the flared edge of his pony cock past her teeth, but once in she took to sucking it like a popcicle.<br />
<br />
This sensation was one the Will deep inside the pony stallion form had long wanted to have Megan do for him. Now his past lust of this was being realized and he was going to make the most of it.<br />
<br />
A building passion made the stallion again masturbate himself as Megan had the cock in her sweet mouth. A squirt, then another and suddenly a roaring flood of such force that the semen choaked Megan.<br />
<br />
Frantic to remove the black stallion's firehose from out her mouth Megan grabbed at it but saw her fingers already changed into hoofs. Her arms too were making the physical changes happen as bones realiened, muscles repositioned, and her shoulders began to narrow together.<br />
<br />
The semen had without a doubt carried an increased tainting of the potion into Megan making her transition from human to pony mare now work even faster. She tried and tried to remove the black hose from out her mouth but Will's sensual delight was such his cock's end remained extra stiff and flared quite wide.<br />
<br />
Her tail was flourishing and almost full grown now. Megan felt the changes working down her backbone. A click from each changing and regrown bone along her back made the girl's body longer and more the size of a real pony mare.<br />
<br />
Moaning her sexual frenzy she at last yanked Will's cock from out her mouth that the stallion jumped back down to stnad on the floor again. Like a boy with a bad injury Will walked in circles trying to reach his head back and lick what hurt.<br />
<br />
Megan found herself now leaning on matured forelegs of a pony mare and her solid hoofs firmly on the apartment's wood floor. She looked back over her lengthening body seeing her pouty round human butt was growing in massive strengths. Her thighs too were gaining mass making them broad but narrow, perfect to spring her eqine body across the open plains.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock, Knock, the remedy is here!&quot; thought Megan.</p>
