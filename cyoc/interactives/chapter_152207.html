<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were shown to chambers, and soon you&#39;d gathered your companions in your own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I hope I can finally get some more detailed explanations?&quot;  you ask.<br />
<br />
The three males nod.  &quot;What would you like to know, my Lady?&quot;  asked Thomas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first of all, I am curious as to why everyone here treats me, a stranger, with such extreme respect and deference?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Thomas frowns.  &quot;It is only natural to us that females be treated with respect.  They are the life-bearers, the mothers of species, and they posses a noble wisdom and kindness that men do not come to as easily.  The male duty is to protect and guard females.  Queen Elunae has told us that many other planets in the cosmos do not seem to comprehend these truths, but the savagery of other cultures that she has described is almost difficult for us to fathom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...is your society matriarchal?  Women are in control?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less,&quot; responded Thomas, &quot;but men have rights and dignity as well, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but still, the deference seems strong.  You treat me like royalty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Vincent spoke up.  &quot;Well, you are, or will be, by virtue both being a vampire female, which is far more rare than the females of most species, and by virtue of being a star-drifter.  Star-drifters have much stronger supernatural abilities than the average person.  You will be stronger than even the ancient vampire lords and ladies in no time.  In addition, once you&#39;ve mastered your ability to travel between planets and worlds, you will be able to bring back technology and magic from those worlds, bettering our world.  It is likely that the vampire royal family will adopt you immediately, and if they do not, you could still amass great power on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but can Queen Elunae, who you said was an elder star-drifter, not travel anywhere that I can, and more easily?&quot;<br />
<br />
shark-boy answered. &quot;As a matter of fact, she cannot.  Each star-drifter can connect to only a finite number of worlds, and overlap outside of our special planet is rare.  You probably cannot go to the worlds that she can, and vice versa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
You conversed with your companions for a while, and learned much about the world.  You learned that it was governed by a number of royal families, the two most powerful of which were the vampires and the weres, and that each side of this rivalry had one star-drifter as its queen, and that your presence would therefore upset the balance.  You learned that you were in the city of Ulqois, which was an experimental neutral ground between all species, and that the planet was called Atrasia.  You learned that, while there were only 5 female vampires, most species had a ratio of 100 males to one female, and that this population was maintained because those species&#39;s females could bear children far more quickly and easily than the humans of your world could, so that it was not uncommon for a female to have well upwards of a hundred children in her lifetime.  Vampires of course could function with even fewer females due to their lack of aging.  When it was mentioned that some star-drifters changed gender when they came to a new world but that they were treated with the full respect due to women, you came clean about your own nature in that regard.  It did not seem to bother them at all.<br />
<br />
Then Vincent nervously interrupted.  &quot;My Lady, there is one more thing that I feel we need to discuss, but it is an uncomfortable topic...&quot;<br />
You nod your ascent to continue, and he does so.  &quot;You see, your powers will take time and training to develop, but should we encounter danger, it is possible for me to borrow your power by drinking your blood.  The reason this is uncomfortable is that...well...drinking another vampire&#39;s blood is an extremely sexual experience, and will leave us sexually linked so that we are far more prone to arousal by each other.&quot;   Vincent was blushing and looking down, now.  In addition you thought the bulge in his swimsuit looked a little larger than usual.<br />
<br />
You smirked.  You were quickly deciding that you liked being the object of so much lust from these three, which you could tell you obviously were, even if they did their best to be polite about it.    &quot;Then I have one more question,&quot; you said.  &quot;Is your culture very sexually liberal, or is it more conservative?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is entirely dominated by the desires of our females, my Lady,&quot; said the Thomas, &quot;Some women are indeed conservative, but we find that most are rather kinky, since the males of this world make them feel safe in being such.  The default is to behave with manners, but any laws concerning, for instance, public nudity or sex, are considered beneath the whims of females.  If you wished it we could engage in public sexual activity and no one could say anything about it.&quot;  Thomas&#39;s lust was growing more evident with every word, and now he treated you to a seductive, smoldering gaze that you had to admit sent a jolt to your new genitals as he continued.  &quot;If I may speak for myself, I would be most glad to serve the Lady in any capacity that she desires.&quot;  <br />
<br />
You hid your smile with your hand coyly, and laughed &quot;What a wonderful culture, but a male is a male in any world, I see.&quot;  You look to the others.  &quot;and the rest of you?  All eager to please me as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
A chorus of affirmations resounded.  &quot;What good boys you are.&quot; you say with a grin.  &quot;So be it then.  You will all be the first of my honor guard.  As such, it will be one of your duties to keep yourselves in good shape for me, and of course to tend to my sexual needs.  I think I&#39;ll have uniforms made for you that make sure to accent your manly bulges nicely.  Also, consider that you only honor me by being hard as much as possible.  I want your beautiful rods all but bursting out of tight clothing whenever I am around.  Is that acceptable to all of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their expressions and the rapidly growing bulges in their swimsuits seemed answer enough that it was far more than acceptable.  They looked as if they thought they&#39;d died and gone to heaven.  You reasoned that the poor things might even all be virgins if females were super rare in this world.  &quot;Yes, my Lady!&quot; Came the joyous response.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we&#39;re in private, there&#39;s no need to call me &quot;my Lady&quot;.  I imagine we will all becomes friends and confidants.  You may call me Alexia.&quot; You say, thinking to adopt a name a little less mundane.  &quot;Now, I must say I have become quite horny, looking at my beautiful new honor guard.  So, who shall have the honor of introducing me to female pleasure?&quot;</p>
