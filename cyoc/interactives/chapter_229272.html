<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time passed before you again awoke. As the vestiges of sleep released their hold, you found that you were now in a stable, while a new presence registered on your awareness. Cocoa flicked her tail, allowing you a glimpse of the stable interior that your host now stood in. The gentle footfalls you detected belonged to a woman with capable, nurturing hands; a woman that not only Cocoa had come to know and trust overtime, but a one you had had an awkward encounter with days earlier. A veterinarian. This woman had inspected Cocoa a couple days ago, monitoring the mare’s estrus cycle. The veterinarian had looked you right in the eyes that day, but to her you had to have looked like an a mare’s unassuming vulva. The fact she did not seem to react to seeing your human eyes on the horse’s taint did not bode well for your recognizability as anything other than a equine snatch. She moved with the silent assurance of someone well-versed in handling large animals. She greeted Cocoa with an affectionate pat on her flank, her touch almost calming as she ran her hand over the mare&#39;s lustrous coat. A reassuring squeeze was given before she reached for her bag of medical instruments and readied herself for the examination. The vet was here for a routine checkup on Cocoa after her mating with the unnamed stallion from the other day. She understood this was an essential aspect of care for breeding horses - verifying that they were healthy and prepared to carry their foals to term. You recognized that you were merely this mare’s reproductive organs and no longer had agency to act on your own. Yet, it was still difficult for you to dispel the sense that something wrong was happening - an absolute violation of one’s personal dignity, even though it was carried out under the pretense of medical necessity. <br />
<br />
The veterinarian had donned a pair of latex gloves that covered the entirety of her forearms and extended past the elbow. She held a large bottle of water-based lubricant and applied a generous amount to her covered arms before she poured some into one of her palms before using her free hand to lift Cocoa’s tail. The woman liberally applied the slick substance to Cocoa’s furry, dark, outer labia. Its cool, thick, oily consistency against your equine skin was uncomfortable, prompting a subtle twitch of muscles that were not your own. Ever so gently, the physician parted the mare’s supple labia and started her inspection – your world turned upside down as you shuddered around her familiar fingers as they probed your soft, warm interior. Cocoa let out an instinctive snort of surprise, her pelvic floor flexed around you. Your vulvar form involuntarily winked around the woman’s forearm as the mare begrudgingly accepted the appendage into her body before calming back down moments later.<br />
<br />
You figured this vet has undoubtedly conducted such examinations numerous times in the past; her movements were precise and experienced but didn’t lessen the demeaning sense of intrusion you felt. It was both mortifying and perverted; you were concurrently experiencing the cool pressure of a latex glove from within while being able to witness the vet’s arm penetrate you from without. It felt disconcerting - invasive yet detached, as if she was examining an unfeeling bit of equine anatomy rather than a living individual. Of course, that was not far from reality. As her hand delved deeper, you could feel your velvety folds yield and stretch around her expert fingertips as she swept along the tissue of Cocoa’s pelvic canal until she found the horse&#39;s cervix. With care, the vet gripped the cervix with her hand, feeling for anything out of the ordinary. She then flattened her hand within you and slid up until she located Cocoa’s uterine horns through the thin membrane of flesh. She alternated between palpating the horns individually, gently squeezing the structures to identify any stored fluids. Finding none, she switch to searching the horse’s ovaries for any abnormalities, gingerly massaging the large oval shaped glands in her hand. Throughout this ordeal, Cocoa remained docile and compliant despite your own discomfort.<br />
<br />
The woman’s sigh drew your focus... <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything appears to be in order,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
She withdrew her hand from you, discarding the latex gloves with a look of satisfaction on her face. She let out a subtle chuckle, patting Cocoa&#39;s flank once more. &quot;Good girl, Cocoa,&quot; she cooed, as she started picking up her tools and tidying her work area. Cocoa flicked her tail in response, a simple gesture that you found adorably heartwarming despite the indignity you had just gone through. <br />
<br />
The vet walked around to Cocoa&#39;s front end, rummaged through her bag for a moment before retrieving an apple. Offering it up to Cocoa, the mare gratefully nibbled at the offered fruit. It was a small comfort – the veterinarian rewarding the horse for being obedient and cooperative. The truth was that in Cocoa’s world, this was simply routine care for a young breeding mare.<br />
<br />
Her examination complete, she began to pack away her equipment into her bag. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cocoa, you did brilliantly,&quot; she said, giving the mare a final pat on her back. She strode near the horse’s rear where you were situated, her boots crunching against the gravel ground beneath. With one last look at Cocoa, she left the stable. &quot;Keep an eye on her,&quot; she suggested to the stable hand who had been standing off to the side during her examination. &quot;Just to be safe.&quot; The young man nodded dutifully. As far as he was aware, today had been just another routine check-up. As you felt the woman&#39;s presence finally depart, the cool spring breeze swooshed past you, causing you to involuntarily contract. The earlier sense of being molested still lingered, a feeling that was both repulsive and bizarrely arousing. You could feel Cocoa&#39;s body respond to the breeze as well, her strong powerful muscles in her hindquarters flexing and twitching in response. Cocoa sighed in relief. <br />
<br />
When the vet&#39;s footsteps faded away, Cocoa lifted her tail and expelled a rumbling fart which resonated within you, echoing off the walls and making your form twitch, followed by a discharge of warm dung that plopped on the ground below. You shuddered at the ghastly sight of equine droppings freefalling past you, intermittent gusts of flatulence occasionally interrupting the otherwise steady deluge. The smell was overpowering, filled with a thick earthy muskiness that made you cringe. You could almost taste it, the pungency seeping into your very essence. It was disconcerting that the steady, rhythmic pattering of horse droppings making contact with the straw-strewn floor was a sound that you strangely starting to find satisfying. Ever since the contact with that stallion and how you lost yourself in that shameful pleasure you suspected that your mind was beginning to warp to better fit your new role. Your thoughts corrupted into impulses that were not entirely your own.<br />
<br />
Your vulvar form pulsed abruptly before Cocoa began to urinate, a powerful torrent of hot, acrid liquid squirted from the portion of yourself that made up the mare’s urethra, spraying down onto the heap of dung below. You did not resist, broken by the events of the past few days. Even if you were able to free yourself from Cocoa, you weren&#39;t sure you even wanted to anymore, or if you’d ever be able to face another human again. The  disgrace and lowliness would be too much to bear. Perhaps occupying Cocoa’s rear as her dark vulva,  functioning as the mare’s reproductive and urinary systems was all that you were good for in this world now. You surrendered to the mare as she subconsciously took control, simply starring at the shimmering golden stream that rushed out of you in complete despair, knowing that this was one of the main purposes you’d serve. You felt every drop, every spurt of of hot urine passing through you. It was an experience you doubted you would ever get used to, but you had no choice - intense and violating all at once. You observed the dwindling stream of urine taper off into a trickle before ceasing altogether, there was a small twinge of satisfaction within you. However, it was quickly clouded by guilt and shame for feeling proud over something so vulgar. You struggled with conflicting emotions as you tried to make sense of it all. <br />
<br />
Yet, as Cocoa finally finished, there was a sense of relief that followed after the ordeal. For the horse, this was just another day - merely another part of her routine. The indignity that gnawed at you was an alien concept to her equine mind. There was something unsettling yet oddly soothing about the simplicity and directness of her indifference. Cocoa swished her dense tail around with a content flick before lowering it once more to cover you up again, hiding you from the world outside. The caress of the coarse hairs of her tail grazing your supple flesh sent shivers through you; a silent testament that you were truly a part of her now. It was strangely comforting.</p>
