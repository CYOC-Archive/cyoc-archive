<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric knew that he couldn&#39;t just steal that ring from Jon. He probably never let that ring out of his sight. So instead, Eric decided to try and figure out where Jon got that ring in the first place. It couldn&#39;t have just appeared out of thin air, right? So, Jon did everything he could to track down where that ring came from. He tailed Jon, asked around school and town, things like that. It took a few weeks, but eventually, he managed to narrow down the location to one place, and Eric was shocked when he figured out that location.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&#39;s company?!&quot; Eric couldn&#39;t believe it; there it was, right under his nose. Well, guess it was time to finally pay his Mom a visit while she&#39;s at work.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Eric went to his Mother&#39;s office to deliver her dinner, as his Mom working late again. Then, he took this opportunity to look around the place. Eric doubted that he could steal a ring from this place, but maybe he could find out where to purchase it or something. Eric didn&#39;t have much time to look around as he was quickly approached by a female employee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, but you wouldn&#39;t happen to be a tester, would you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sorry. I&#39;m not,&quot; Eric replied truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, would you like to be one? Oh, I&#39;m sorry for asking that out of the blue. It&#39;s just that a couple of the testers never showed up, and we have a deadline to meet, and combining magic and science is hard and...&quot; The woman was talking too frantically for Eric to completely understand what she was saying. However, he knew he needed to calm her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, calm down. Just breath in and out, okay?&quot; Eric brought the woman to a place where she could sit down and catch her breath. After she calmed down, Eric decided to ask her something. &quot;So, may I ask what you&#39;re testing, exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s a ring that you can use to change your body and muscle mass-&quot; that all Eric needed to hear, so he cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more. I&#39;ll be happy to help test your product.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
A while later, Eric was back in his room with the ring in hand. Apparently, the engineers were making a version that had smartphone integration. Interesting, but something to mess with later. <br />
<br />
Eric had taken off his clothes and now taking one final look at his beanpole of a body. Better take a good look because he wasn&#39;t going to see it again anytime soon. Well, at least until his Mom got back or something...<br />
<br />
His was pounding when he put on the ring; he was finally going to be something other than a stick. He was going to be hot! Eric twisted the ring as Jon did before and awaited the changes.<br />
<br />
It started out slow with his fingers, growing thicker and stronger before Eric&#39;s eyes. After that, however, the changes kicked into high gear, and bulky muscles exploded all over Eric&#39;s body. Former pipe cleaner arms suddenly blew up with huge biceps and triceps. His shoulders widen to more than twice their original width. A pair of boulder-like burst from Eric&#39;s former flat chest, and at the same time, his back strengthened to match. The muscle gut that he had grown told Eric that this was the setting Jon used for football. Finally, Eric&#39;s transformation concluded with his former chicken legs becoming thick with a combination of muscle and fat to support the rest of his bulky body.<br />
<br />
That transformation left Eric panting. Goddamn, what a rush, he thought. If only it lasted a bit longer, though, then he could have enjoyed it more. Something to talk about in his reports to the engineers, he supposed. Despite the somewhat disappointing transformation sequence, Eric could not argue with the results. Especially when he looked in the mirror and saw a sexy strongman looking back at him. Eric flexed his arms and watched his biceps bulged. He cupped his pecs and loved the feeling of hard muscle beneath a soft layer of fat. He then moved his hands down to his muscle gut, happy to know that it was hard and strong and not flabby at all. Eric was so happy he could cry; he finally wasn&#39;t a skinny dweeb anymore. He just felt... so big, and there was still more to come.<br />
<br />
Eric twisted the ring again in the other direction and moaned as he felt the changes occurring throughout his body. All the fat he had melted off his body as his muscle grew again in both size and definition. Like what happened to Jon before, Eric&#39;s muscle gut receded into a tight set of abs. Eric looked liked one of those teen bodybuilders now and was loving how it felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grrr!&quot; Eric growled as he began flexing in the mirror. He felt so strong now and needed to show off his strength and muscularity. He didn&#39;t know if he liked being stocky or ripped more, but he didn&#39;t have to choose. With this ring, he could switch back and forth between the two forms as many times as he wanted, and as long as he wasn&#39;t skinny, he was happy.<br />
<br />
After he was finished flexing, Eric finally decided to see what options were on his smartphone. It seems like he could fine-tune the changes you go through. There were options like choosing the exact amount of body fat you would have and how big your muscles would be right to the inch. It also seemed he could use his phone to switch between forms as well. Interesting. Eric wondered how the engineers could make something like this, however judging from that woman&#39;s reaction earlier, it couldn&#39;t have been easy.<br />
<br />
There was one new function that caught Eric&#39;s eye, though. The option to change other people even if they were not wearing the ring. So he could change anyone he wanted? If that were the case, then Eric was about to have some fun with this thing.</p>
