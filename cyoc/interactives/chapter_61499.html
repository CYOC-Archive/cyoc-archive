<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following morning, Ted had deliberately forgotten all about the peculiar incident. During classes, he didn't notice that Lee was a bit more <br />
quiet than usual. Nor had he picked up on why the game, or the Nightmare King, had told him to take Lee out on a date. As far as he was <br />
concerned, everything was normal.<br />
<br />
School finished and he hurried home to prepare for his date with Lucy. He was giddy that she would be so bowled over by his romantic gesture <br />
that he was bound to get some that night. <br />
<br />
Lucy arrived at his house at 6.30, for he not been so chivalrous to go to hers, and they walked into town towards the restaurant. She was <br />
impressed that he dressed up for a change and seemed to be quite excited. Ted could barely contain his anticipation. So long as he didn't mess <br />
up at dinner, it was in the bag.<br />
<br />
In fact, for the most part, it did go pretty well. The food was a bit expensive, but Ted had expected that. They chatted and laughed and had a <br />
good time. But halfway through their meal, at about 7.30, Ted began to feel a little strange. It felt like his teeth were pressing against his lips a <br />
bit too hard. He shrugged it off, but it kept bothering him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Lucy asked, &quot;You keep smacking your lips.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do my teeth look big to you?&quot;<br />
He opened his mouth wide and invited her too look. Lucy was a bit dismayed that he was doing this now of all times, but obliged.<br />
&quot;I dunno, they look fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried to ignore it, but soon he couldn't concentrate on anything else. He wasn't paying attention to what Lucy was saying, and he could tell <br />
she was getting annoyed.<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he quickly tried to save things, &quot;I just need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
She sighed. He left.<br />
<br />
He found the men's room and began bearing his gums at the mirror and poking at his canines. He couldn't be sure, but they did look a bit <br />
larger than normal. Suddenly, the instant he thought that, they bulged. Wide eyed, he watched as two of his teeth extended far out of his mouth <br />
and out into smooth, pointed tusks.<br />
<br />
He began to gibber in distress, but with his new teeth he couldn't help slobbering and lisping as he spoke, which only distressed him more. <br />
Tears in his eyes, he tentatively touched them with his fingers. At that moment, his nose seemed to fall off his face. <br />
<br />
He yelped, but thankfully it was still attached, only now it was a long, dangling trunk. He looked at his reflection and saw his ears stretch out <br />
into big, flappy things. He was starting to look like an elephant.<br />
<br />
He hadn't been as scared as he was now since the time he'd got lost in the woods as a child. And, just like then, he sought help from the one <br />
person he'd trusted. He took out his phone and called Lee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee, yaw gowtta help me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Who is this?&quot;<br />
&quot;It'thh me, Ted!&quot;<br />
&quot;What's up with your voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Ted's athletic body began to balloon with fat. The buttons on his tight shirt pinged against the mirror as his flabby belly fell out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thomethingh fucked ith happenning!&quot;<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm turningh indo an elethant!&quot;<br />
&quot;You're what?&quot;<br />
<br />
The crotch of his pants gave way as his waist expanded. To Ted's horror, a large, grey cock fell out and dangled monstrously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm turningh indo an elethant!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't understand...&quot;<br />
&quot;It'th thad fucked up game! It'th the punithment! You godda thtop it!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Ted never heard Lee's reply, for his hands had become pudgy hoofish feet. The phone clattered to a floor and, in his distress, he crushed it <br />
with his feet.. His majestic head was disproportionate to his body, but it was quickly catching up and space in the room was becoming limited. <br />
His skin became a mottled grey, his body, large and heavy. Soon he could no longer stand. <br />
<br />
Within moments, he looked in the mirror and could only see an upset African elephant amidst a tatter of clothes and shoes.</p>
