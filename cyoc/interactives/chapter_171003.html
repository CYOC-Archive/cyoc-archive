<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrea couldn&#39;t stop glancing at Alecia&#39;s-- no, Alec, breasts as she sat down to feed the girls one more time. They had been walking for hours and, which each passing minute, she could feel her feeling for Alecia shift. She was starting to see her as beautiful, loving and caring. Andrea was thinking of her as her wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;These little ones are fast asleep,&quot; Alecia said with smile, placing the two sleeping girls on the ground and covering them with a blanket. Her gaze was filled with so much motherly love, that Andrea was unsure how much she could take it.<br />
<br />
Once again, her eyes focused on Alecia&#39;s breasts, still dropping with milk. <br />
<br />
&#39;I wonder what it tastes like&#39; Andrea thought. &#39;Bet it tastes amazing.&#39;<br />
<br />
Alecia noticed Andrea&#39;s gaze. &quot;See something you like, darling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I love starting at your tits,&quot; Andrea said, surprisingly even herself with her sincerity. &quot;Your milk must be delicious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alecia looked surprised for a few seconds before she relaxed and smiled. &quot;There&#39;s enough for you too, my love. Come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finding neither the will or strength to resist, Andrea rushed to Alecia&#39;s side and latched onto her nipple. Soon she was rewarded with Alecia&#39;s warm milk and it was everything she had hoped it to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;My, my, aren&#39;t you hungry?&quot; Alecia said, smiling kindly and ruffling Andrea&#39;s hair. <br />
<br />
Andrea kept suckling on her breasts, she felt so happy and safe. The way Alecia was looking at her made her feel so loved. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so cute, Andy. I love so much,&quot; Alecia said, pulling Andrea close and kissing her forehead. &quot;But... I don&#39;t think I love you like a spouse anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea blinked, slightly worried by Alecia&#39;s words, but it was hard to worry when she felt so good. Alecia moved her slightly to get more comfortable and Andrea relunctely let of of her nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama,&quot; Andrea moaned, quickly latching to the other nipple. Wait, did she said &#39;mama&#39;? <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, honey. Mama is here. You&#39;ve noticed it, we&#39;re becoming parent and child too, although... you might be a bit too big for mommy&#39;s lap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea snugled to her mother closer. She wanted to be near her forever, she never wanted to let go of her mama and her boobies. As her thoughts changed, she noticed her clothes were growing larger and her hand holding Alecia&#39;s breast was becoming smaller and pudgier.<br />
<br />
With the grace of an experienced mother, Alecia removed Andrea&#39;s  now too large clothes while she was still breastfeeding. Staring her new child&#39;s crotch, Alecia smile slyly and whispered &quot;I wonder...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alecia placed a hand on Andrea&#39;s still shrinking vagina, causing the now 12 year old girl to moan loudly. &quot;You&#39;re becoming so small, Andy. My beautiful son.&quot;<br />
<br />
An electric shock went through Andrea&#39;s body, focusing on the crotch her mother was rubbing. Soon, her clit felt larger and longer, it felt really good when mommy rubbed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;My little Andrew is growing a little penis. You&#39;re mama&#39;s little boy, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;No! Alecia, what are you doing? I&#39;m not a boy!&#39; Alecia thought desperately, she was unable to talk with her mama&#39;s nipple on her mouth and the good feeling on her growing penis. She looked down and saw that her breasts were shrinking into her chest, her niples small as quarters, while the rest of her body became lean and only slightly muscular, like that of a pre-teen boy who was used to run and fight a lot to protect his mother and his two little sisters. These three women meant the world to Andrew, they were his family and he was determined to keep them safe until they got to Alabaster.<br />
<br />
&#39;No! I&#39;m not a boy... I&#39;m...&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;You always take so much go care of us, my love. You&#39;re so mature and responsible. I don&#39;t know where these memories and feelings are coming from and I know deep down they&#39;re not real, but I don&#39;t care. I love all three of you so much, by beautiful children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew could feel her/his mind changing aswell. She/he was starting to think of herself... himself as a boy. Strangely, that didn&#39;t bother him as much as he thought it should. He looked at his erect penis in his mother&#39;s hand, it bothered him that it was still so small and childlike. He wanted it to be big like the adults and the other older boys. <br />
<br />
A sharp pain in his abdomen forced Andrew to look down at his crotch again. Both him and his mother stared in awe as his labia sealed shut and became a sack, followed by the strange feeling of his ovaries shifting inside his body and dropping into his new scrotum, becoming new and fully functioning testicles. His final change happened as his uterus shrank and moved closer to his anus, transforming into a prostate. <br />
<br />
Andrew let go of his mother&#39;s nipple and scream: &quot;Mom! I feel weird, something is... AHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sperm sprouted from his new penis and the young boy experience his first male orgasm, it was the best feeling he had ever had. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, Mom. I mean Alecia... I mean...&quot; <br />
<br />
Alecia shock her head and hugged her son. &quot;It perfectly normal, Andrew. Don&#39;t apologize. &quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew smiled and sat down staring at Alecia and his now too big and useless clothes. &quot;I think of you as my mother now too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird, I look at you and I know you&#39;re my son. Even if part of me is saying this is not real, that&#39;s how it feels to me. Even new memories are appearing in my mind, I remember... giving birth to you and your sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alecia, we really need to get to Alabaster and fix this. We&#39;re all changing too fast and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, please, can you call me &#39;Mom&#39;?&quot; Alecia pleaded, her eyes feeling with tears. &quot;When you call me by my first name, it... it feels wrong. It makes me sad somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew knew these feeling were fake. He knew Alecia was not his mother, Nekka and Vivian were not his sister and he was not really Andrew, but staring at her like this he felt nothing but love and the urge to protect them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mom. It&#39;s going to be okay. I&#39;ll take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alecia smiled and kissed her son&#39;s forehead. &quot;My brave, young man. Why don&#39;t you get some sleep? You can grab one of the covers and sleep next to the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t have any clothes now, Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can make something out of your old clothes and some fabric you have left. Now get some sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded, grabbed a cover and laid down next to his little sisters, who, as if instinctively, moved closer to their protective older brother. With his belly filled with his mother&#39;s milk, Andrew finally feel asleep, he hoped his bratty sisters left him a bit of mom&#39;s milk for him in the morning.</p>
