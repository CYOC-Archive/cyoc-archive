<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Badboy Baboon grinned wickedly. &quot;Let’s see how tough you are after a little mental de-evolution, kid,&quot; the Baboon cackled. It pressed a button, and before Alex could react, a beam of energy shot toward him, enveloping him in a bright, crackling light.<br />
<br />
Alex gasped, his body tensing as the strange energy coursed through him. His mind felt foggy, a wave of confusion washing over him. “W-What’s happening?” he muttered, gripping his head as he staggered backward.<br />
<br />
The Badboy Baboon’s laughter echoed through the room. “That’s right, Red Warrior. You’re about to feel real dumb.”<br />
<br />
Alex’s hands trembled as he tried to focus, but everything felt… strange. His sharp instincts, his tactical thinking, his ability to strategize—it was all slipping away. He struggled to hold onto his human thoughts.<br />
<br />
“No… I can… fight this…” Alex muttered through gritted teeth, but his words were already starting to slur. His heart raced as his mind clouded with impulses he didn’t understand. He looked at his hands, flexing his fingers as his grip weakened. His strong stance faltered, and his feet shuffled awkwardly on the floor.<br />
<br />
His body felt heavier, his posture slouching. And then came the worst part: a strange, primal urge started to bubble up inside him. Alex shook his head, trying to resist, but it was like fighting an unstoppable tide. He felt his lips curl, baring his teeth instinctively as a low, guttural sound escaped his throat.<br />
<br />
“Ahh, there it is,” the Badboy Baboon taunted. “I bet it’s hard to think with a monkey brain, huh?”<br />
<br />
Alex’s eyes widened in horror. His thoughts were slipping away faster now—reason and logic replaced by base instinct. He reached for the words to speak, but all that came out was a confused grunt. His hands clenched into fists, but not in defense—more out of some primal need to hit or grab something, anything.<br />
<br />
“N-No… I… can’t…” Alex tried to speak again, but his voice was a garbled, throaty growl. His chest heaved as he hunched over, his movements becoming more erratic. His brain buzzed with nonsensical impulses—swinging from trees, climbing, screeching.<br />
<br />
Kenny watched in shock, eyes wide as he saw the transformation take hold of his son. “A-Alex?” Kenny stammered, his small voice trembling. He wanted to run over, to help, but his legs felt frozen in place.<br />
<br />
Alex grunted, his body jerking uncontrollably. He clawed at the air as if reaching for something to grab onto, his breath coming out in heavy, guttural pants. His strong, calm demeanor was gone, replaced by an almost wild, animalistic energy. His eyes darted around the room as if searching for something—but there was no reasoning left behind them.<br />
<br />
The Badboy Baboon stomped over to him, crouching down as it jeered, “What’s the matter, little monkey boy? Can’t talk anymore?”<br />
<br />
Alex bared his teeth and let out a frustrated screech, his fists pounding the floor as his body succumbed to its new instincts. He tried to fight back, tried to regain control, but every second that passed made it harder to think. Harder to remember who he even was.<br />
<br />
“I warned you,” the Badboy Baboon sneered, patting Alex’s now-slouched form on the head. “Now, you’re like me. A dumb little monkey.”<br />
<br />
Kenny’s heart pounded in his chest. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing. His son—his strong, brave son—was reduced to this. And yet, despite the horror, a part of Kenny still admired Alex. Even now, seeing him struggle against this terrible transformation, Kenny couldn’t help but look up to him.<br />
<br />
But the Badboy Baboon wasn’t done. With a cruel smile, it turned toward Kenny, eyes gleaming with mischief. “Well, why should Alex get to have all the fun? I think you should join him, little man.”<br />
<br />
Kenny’s eyes widened. “No! Please, don’t—” But it was too late. The remote flashed again, and Kenny was enveloped in the same shimmering light. He felt the same strange buzzing in his mind, like a thousand thoughts being drowned out by one overwhelming urge.<br />
<br />
His small hands trembled as they flexed and curled, a strange, uncomfortable feeling washing over him. “A-Alex…” he whimpered, but his voice cracked and devolved into a helpless squeak.<br />
<br />
Kenny’s body slouched, just like Alex’s had, and he felt his thoughts scattering, replaced with simpler, more primal instincts. His once-firm understanding of who he was began to fade, replaced with an odd desire to mimic the creature before him. He felt an urge to jump, to swing, to make noises that he couldn’t even understand. His admiration for Alex turned into something different—a need to follow, to obey, to be like him.<br />
<br />
He let out a soft grunt, looking up at Alex, now his fellow monkey-minded companion. The thoughts of being a grown man, of being Alex’s father, were gone—replaced by simple emotions and base impulses.<br />
<br />
The Badboy Baboon stood tall, its wicked laughter filling the room. “Look at you two! Just a couple of dumb monkeys! This is too easy.”<br />
<br />
Kenny’s small body twitched, his movements becoming erratic as he tried to stand, but all he could do was fidget and grunt. He couldn’t form words anymore—his mind, like Alex’s, was lost to the primitive desires taking hold of him. He crawled forward on all fours, looking at the Badboy Baboon with wide, confused eyes, mimicking the creature’s movements without understanding why.<br />
<br />
Alex, now fully transformed mentally, screeched and climbed onto the couch, jumping up and down like an animal. His once-proud figure was gone, replaced by a creature of pure instinct. Kenny followed, his small body scrambling to keep up, climbing and screeching alongside his son.<br />
<br />
The Badboy Baboon grinned triumphantly, watching them both. “Now you two know what it feels like to be nothing more than mindless beasts!”</p>
