<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was just one of his students.  John told them to go away and they did.<br />
John got his shorts back on and went on with the rest of his day.  A few periods went by watching the high schoolers hop around the gym and play dodgeball, John’s only worry was keeping his raging erection hidden and keeping his hole clenched.  He couldn’t believe that George was this horny all the time, how did he think of anything else.  Lunch break rolled around so John decided to go check on George in his office and see how his day had been.  <br />
John wandered down the hall passing a few students between offices before he finally stood in front of George’s office.  John though about knocking but decided whatever reason that George had closed his door was well worth seeing.<br />
John put his head to the door to listen in and see if he could see anything.  He heard what he could only figure was a sloshing noise.  He couldn’t believe it George had not only found someone at the school to suck him off, but he also found someone willing to suck off that giant cock he gave George.  Just the anticipation had gotten John’s now mediocre cock tenting in his shorts.  Finally John reached for the door handle and turned it.  John went inside quickly but was surprised when he walked into George’s office.  John had expected to find some random girl under or near his desk suck his massive member.  George was actually all alone sitting on the floor of his office hunched over sucking on his own cock.  John hadn’t even thought to suck himself off but George was so engrossed in sucking his own cock that he hadn’t even noticed that John walked into his office.<br />
John felt his hole itch more and more as he watched the large cock in envy as George sucked long and deep.  As John moved closer to George he finally get out of his daze and looked up.  Barely taking any time John moved on George only eyeing his cock.  Without saying a word John pulled down his shorts so nothing hid the raging boner the hard cock had given him.  George’s throbbing prostate was driving John mad with lust.  He couldn’t believe he was going to do this but he spit into his hand and wiped the spit onto his already semi lubed hole. <br />
“Hey, John, ummm this isn’t what you think,”  George finally piped up.   Before George could say anything John pushed George onto his back and sat down on his cock that was now on George’s body.  John and George both moaned as they felt George’s new giant cock press its way into John warm, not so tight hole.  <br />
John started to bounce faster as he got used to the large cock moving in and out of him.  The pressure was almost too much as John’s breath got heavier and faster.  “John, no stop you are gonna make me shootooottoo,”  before he even finished the sentence George was already unloading his hot load deep into John.  John groaned as he felt the load go deep in his hole.  The pressure from the load was too much and John was overwhelmed with the pleasure.  He quickly grabbed his cock and with only a few strokes he was unloading a giant cumload all over George.  A full cup of semen squirted out his cock.  <br />
John then stood up and there was an audible pop as the giant cock popped out of him.  <br />
“Well, where did that come from”  George said as he sat up and the cum started to drip down his body.  “I’m not sure but, I sure feel a lot better now.”  John replied.  “But, let’s just keep this to ourselves, I don’t think we need anyone to see us or think of us like this.”<br />
“That’s ok with me my wife would be a little overwhelmed,” George said, “but I do have to take a shower, you shot a huge load all over me.”<br />
John turned around and felt the cum leak from his hole down his leg.  He pulled up his shorts and nodded his head, “Well, just make sure that you lock your office door next time, also don’t forget about parent teacher conferences next week.”<br />
John wobbled a little bit as he headed toward the door.  George then quickly got up and wiped his cum soaked body down with an old t shirt and headed toward the Coaches locker room.<br />
John walked into the hall, a dark spot slowly becoming more noticeable as his hole leaked George’s cum onto the back of his shorts.<br />
John went to go get some lunch and to try to figure out what he should do next.  Maybe it was time to trade again.</p>
