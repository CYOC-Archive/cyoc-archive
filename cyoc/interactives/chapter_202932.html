<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The more he looked himself over in the mirror, the more uncomfortable Dan started to feel. Having muscles was nice and all, but it just wasn&#39;t him. He wasn&#39;t some muscle headed gym rat, or sports star. Nor did he want to be. Having grown up thin, he felt more comfortable being that way. <br />
<br />
Well one thought lead to another until an idea popped into his head. He liked the toned muscle look, just not on himself. So what if it didn&#39;t need to be? He clicked on the global settings and made the average man naturally well toned with a good muscle definition. Abs, pecs, the works. A &quot;swimmer&#39;s&quot; body if you will. Not some puffy cloud of muscle though.<br />
<br />
Then he focused in on himself and changed one specific thing, his sex. Setting himself to be female turned around his sexual orientation, making him (her) attracted to men. Dan was fine with that, and if anything, wanted it to be like that. He then customized himself to be a bit more than just a little busty, but still with a pretty narrow waist. A really well defined hourglass figure. He made his hair color black, and changed his height to 5&#39;-4&quot;. <br />
<br />
Then he got into the finer details. He made himself allowed to have his boobs completely uncovered and exposed at all times, regardless of who was around to see them. He also set his feet to depend on him wearing at minimum a 4&quot; heel in order to not hurt when walking. And made it so easy for him to be able to walk in any sized high heel, it would almost be like they were his own feet. He also made his breasts lactate. Lastly, he made himself bisexual, but lean significantly more straight than lesbian, but still remain very willing to have threesomes with either a woman, or a man as the third. <br />
<br />
He changed his name to Danielle and saved the settings. He felt the world shift around, along with his body. It was so chaotic that he ended up passing out for a few moments, giving him the opportunity to wake up as a woman.<br />
<br />
When Danielle did awake, she had to move her hair out of her face and slowly sit up. She felt her large tits bounced around since she was topless, and looked down at her new body with a grin on her gorgeous face. Danielle went to stand up and crumpled to the floor in pain as her legs gave out. She quickly remembered that she needed heels now. Luckily there was a strappy pair of 5&quot; platform stilettos right beside her. She put them on and tried standing once more, this time to remarkable success. <br />
<br />
Moving around was beyond easy, so she entered her closet for something to wear. She picked out a stylish skirt, but noticed that her only kind of upper wear were corsets. She shrugged and picked one up and put it on. The corset fit her snugly, and actually pushed her tits together to form some impressive cleavage and without covering them up whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Smiling to herself, Danielle minced her way out of the closet and began striking some pretty sexy poses in the mirror. Her boobs no longer bounced, but the surface of her cleavage definitely jiggled around with each and every step she took. <br />
<br />
She felt perfect, as if she were always meant to be a woman. Perhaps this was the reason behind her low self esteem? Had she simply been the wrong gender for her whole life and never knew it? Either way, it didn&#39;t matter anymore, she felt both right and good. <br />
<br />
After making one final pose, Danielle finished up and left her room, walking right out the front door and onto the busy street. Her jaw nearly dropped as her panties became almost instantly soaked. There were so many ridiculously hot guys everywhere! Tall, muscular, handsome hunks! Not one of them shorter than 6 foot. An entire head&#39;s height above her. <br />
<br />
There were even several women who caught her eye as well. And her new confidence in herself made getting down off the steps to her home so much simpler to do. Danielle didn&#39;t hesitate and walked with her head held up high and her bare tits pushed forwards. Her hips swayed seductively with each step she took and her ass slightly jiggled, following her titties&#39; example. <br />
<br />
It took mere seconds for someone to start hitting on her, and she allowed him to give it his best shot. He didn&#39;t live up to her ideal, so she turned him down politely and moved on, stepping onto the train after arriving at the station. A few stops later, she got off the train headed directly for the down town café she knew was a hot spot for super attractive people around her age. It was there where she would start her search for a boyfriend.</p>
