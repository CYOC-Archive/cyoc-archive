<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After speaking with Michelle, Duchess and Cassandra sat in the conference room with Sarah looking hopeful that this meeting would go peacefully while Duke and Jacob still thought the matter seemed unlikely. Some tea had been brought in for Duchess and Cassandra who had asked for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, like I said before, we wished to establish diplomatic ties with the supernatural and I wanted to reach out to the vampire community first since my associates are....I suppose well acquainted with them is the best word to use here.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I suppose that is the best word to use. But just so you know, Director McMillan, you&#39;re the one person here I can tolerate the most, if I weren&#39;t here on business....&quot; Cassandra said before Duchess held her hand and Cassandra took a deep breath and patted her hand for the help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Lord Wyatt told me he does wish to avoid aggression as much as he can right now running a country and raising his offspring. So he has agreed to go through with your diplomatic ties as it were.&quot; Cassandra said taking a sip of her tea, then began to add a few sugars to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good news to hear, so we can....&quot; Sarah began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;With a few stipulations.&quot; Cassandra said finishing with her sugars in her cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you were warned, no tricks.&quot; Duke reminded Cassandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t a trick, before we left, Lord Wyatt gave Cassandra some conditions to run by you. None of them are in anyway....harmful to your cause.&quot; Duchess noted as Cassandra continued with her tea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. First, our lord is well aware there are still vampires who are here in the states. There are a few options you can give them, if they wish to remain here in the states, fine by us. If however, they wish to travel to our homeland, please let them do so. Our lord wishes to give those who need it, a home. Finally, if there are any who wish to work with you, aside from...him,&quot; Cassandra glaring at Duke. &quot;It&#39;s fine with us. It&#39;s their afterlife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the ones who want neither to be in the home land or in the states?&quot; Duke asked. &quot;That&#39;s up to you. Send them to our country or to kill them like humans have done for years. As it stands, these are our conditions, do you agree director?&quot; Cassandra asked as Sarah sat in thought for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as neither preconditions are broken, it&#39;s fine by me.&quot; Director McMillan said as he reached out her hand to shake Cassandra&#39;s who returned it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;re done here. Come Duchess.&quot; Cassandra said as she stood up and reached out her hand for Duchess to take it and stood alongside her as they went back to the portal to return home and in a moment, they were gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That went....a little better than I hoped.&quot; Sarah said as she looked at Jacob who shook his head. &quot;I still hate that bitch.&quot; Jacob said as he turned to go do some work.<br />
<br />
***************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;I still hate that bastard.&quot; Cassandra said through her teeth as they returned home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mistress, I know how it pained you to be in the same room as the two of them, but I could see it in their eyes, they were nervous the entire time about your standards.&quot; Duchess said both of Cassandra&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, it did fill me with pride inside to see the two of them squirm. Daddy, would&#39;ve been so proud.&quot; Cassandra sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never knew him, Mistress but if he instilled such wisdom in you, then he must&#39;ve been a great man.&quot; Duchess complimented. Cassandra looked to Duchess and gave her a smirk tickled her chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he was. Come Duchess, we must inform our Lord and Lady of how our meeting went.&quot; Cassandra said as Duchess took a long sigh as she felt her chin where Cassandra had tickled it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, my mistress.&quot; Duchess said with a loving sigh.<br />
<br />
*************************************<br />
<br />
Back with Spark and Connor, their double date talk with Calista and Mitch was going rather well considering they had to censor or change some words around.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;ve met her family?&quot; Mitch asked Connor as they ate some snacks and drank some drinks while doing so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I have. Her siblings are all pretty cool, I think Star is her favorite sibling.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like one I....debate things with the most.&quot; Spark said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I remember Star. I always thought she would be the one to find a match with sooner than you. Seems I was wrong, you&#39;ll be the one with a baby faster than her.&quot; Calista said as Connor gagged on his drink while Spark blushed red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh...yes...he and I...that is....the uh...head of our country certainly thought he seemed like a good match with me.&quot; Spark said as now it was Calista&#39;s turn to gag on her own drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;You met Queen...I mean....the leader of our country?!&quot; Calista asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was really surprising and scary considering she wanted to meet us. I guess that&#39;s what happens when your family works within the...military, you meet some people up high in ranks.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They met the leader of....secret word?&quot; Maggie asked her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she was more....relaxed than I would have thought. It put me more at ease with how okay she was with us.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going back to meeting her family, how about her parents?&quot; Mitch asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my mom loved him when she met him. I think she practically wants us to elope.&quot; Spark said as Connor blushed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about her dad?&quot; Mitch asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, he is like....the standard definition of &#39;protective dad&#39;. I almost...uh....pooped my pants when I met him for the first time.&quot; Connor said making his words less vulgar around Maggie as she giggled at Connor saying the word &#39;poop&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;He likes you, he&#39;s still sees me as his little girl.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
Connor, Spark, and Mitch talked with each other about other things including how Maggie was doing and Spark thought things were going pretty well now as she relaxed from the nervousness she felt earlier.</p>
