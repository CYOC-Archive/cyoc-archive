<br />
'And just like that it's over.' Marie thought. 'I have no say in weather she comes with me <br />
now. ' <br />
<br />
'And just like that it's over.' Kathrine thought. 'Three years of bruises, cracked bones, claw <br />
marks, bite marks, and one missing fang, and it's finally over. I'm free. Okay witches! You <br />
brides of Satan! You are going to burn!' Kathrine thoughts these thoughts heroically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kathrine.&quot; Said Armando calmly and sternly getting the felman's attention. <br />
<br />
'No Monkey-Cat?' &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As your teacher, and as my student, I give you one last lesson: Unless you are prepared to <br />
die, you will grieve over the dead bodies of your packmates, if you are not prepared to kill, <br />
your packmates will grieve over your dead body. No enemy I've ever met hesitated to kill, <br />
you have to be prepared to do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Thou Shall Not Kill...'&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe the actual translation is 'Thou Shall Not Murder.' Otherwise I'd be going to <br />
confession after every meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie looked as Kathrine made final words with the naked wolf man who was taller than <br />
Marie the way Marie was taller than Kathrine. <br />
<br />
'Draco would think me insane if I told me that we had waited three years while a friend of <br />
mine learned to defend herself instead of me finding a competent soldiers in a third that <br />
time at least. Maybe I am insane. What sane woman would do half the things I've done?' <br />
<br />
Marie knew it was wrong, but she somehow felt satisfaction for when Abaza was executed <br />
before her eyes rather than the pity she did when she put the unwilling victims of curses <br />
out of their misery. Was it because he had chosen to be what he was? Or had Marie simply <br />
gotten used to her appointed task?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along Kathrine, we have a lot to do.&quot; Marie took her hand. She then looked at the <br />
gray and faded crimson Wolf Pack Alpha and bowed her head, &quot;Thank you for teaching my <br />
friend to defend herself. Tell no one of this or her, the Inquisition will deny it all for I do <br />
not exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you not exist when you stand before me?&quot; The old lupman said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;.... &quot; Marie wasn't sure how to respond to that. &quot;I'll think about that. Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Roman Wolfpack was, of course, very disappointed at the let down of a fight that had <br />
been building for three years. They knew there was going to be no blood letting, but they <br />
had been hoping for a true display of skills. Being denied that left them in a bad mood, <br />
and Marie realized it was best to not test their hospitality. <br />
<br />
As the Nuns made their way back to the sanctuary of Rome's walls, Marie Cruz thought of <br />
the trick spear that Kathrine now carried with her, in separate parts, hidden of course.  In <br />
spite of their marriage to God, both of them were carrying WEAPONS. Marie was already <br />
sure both of them were going to Hell for betraying such a basic tenant. All the same, no <br />
reason for Katrhine to be thrown into the deeper levels of Hell by Marie making Kathrine <br />
own crimes worse. <br />
<br />
Marie chose to spoke, before they entered the city least their words echoed to prying ears <br />
and found their way to Zoey. (Marie gave the girl credit, she was a wealth of local <br />
information if you knew how to ask the right questions). <br />
<br />
&quot;Kathrine, I've been a killer since before the age that most of those pups were still <br />
cringing at breaking the neck of a weasel... The night I lost this eye was also the night I <br />
lost any right to being a normal child.... No. I think it was when I saw my parents burned <br />
after dying from the plague, and I was next.&quot; Marie didn't remember much from those <br />
days, but one thing she'd never ever forget was the image of her parents dead from <br />
plague, burned to ashes.<br />
<br />
&quot;The night I lost my eye just awoke it. Don't become a killer Kathrine. No matter how many <br />
times you wash your hands, the blood stains won't ever go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie knew her duty to the Inquisition wouldn't end simply because the witches did. That <br />
was just a fantasy on Kathrine's part. Like something out of a fairy tale where once the <br />
wicked witch was dead all the other problems the person had faded away. But Marie saw <br />
no reason to shatter that illusion right now however. She was the Inquisition's for life as <br />
much as she was God's bride. Marie just hoped that Marie, Kathrine and Draco all lived to <br />
see old age. 'Besides We've sworn ourselves to God. Our only marriage is to God. Our lines <br />
end here anyway.'<br />
<br />
As the two entered the Vatican, the pair noticed the other pair of a human nun with <br />
glasses chatting happily with a leoman nun with the most non-extraordinary shade of <br />
brown fur imaginable.  It seemed the gossip princess herself had also finally found a real <br />
friend.  'Alaba and Zoey. A to Z?' Marie thought of the symmetry of the names. Zoey had <br />
found someone willing to share all they knew, and for Zoey to share all she knew with. <br />
<br />
'Friendship takes all forms.' Marie thought. And thought of the friendship she had with the <br />
witches, or at least, thought she had through her dreams.  And she remembered the <br />
daunting near impossible task ahead of her and her teammates. 'Bride of Satan,' She <br />
thought with disgust. <br />
<br />
Across the atlantic, another one eyed woman the same age as Marie felt a chill down her <br />
spine and had the mental image of the woman she had dreamed about decades before <br />
were the town had been in ruin (likely following their own rules to oblivion) and her foster <br />
father wood and nailed to a cross (likely by the puritans) who had judge them evil for <br />
seeking to free humanity from the unfair and cruel laws that had been imposed on them <br />
without their say!  Only one term described such a creature to Gogatha (whose chosen <br />
name she had picked in direct mockery of her foster father's converted religon).  &quot;Dog of <br />
God.&quot; She whispered under her breath. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We're to get going at once?.. You do realize that--&quot; Draco began glaring through his <br />
bandaged face. <br />
<br />
Marie nodded her head like a rocking horse, &quot;Yes yes yes I know! BUt I TOLD YOU that this <br />
was going to be the date that we had to leave! Are all the arrangements made?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't use that tone of voice, and yes, it's been voted on and decided that yes, we need to <br />
have a foot hold in the New World to lead the Protestants back to the true church. And <br />
you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Inquisition is willing to send me there if to just have me far away from them. I'm <br />
officially of course to establish part of the Inquisition there... by myself, with pretty much <br />
no support... When the witches are dead it's going to be interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When they're dead, you've turned into a optimist Marie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been hanging out with a friend of mine too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's that then for me as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a friend of mine I haven't seen in decades almost, never did find what happened to <br />
him, the records simply stop, like he vanished into thin air.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. I'm sorry.&quot; Marie said, the stereotypical dragon didn't have friends.  But Kathrine had <br />
taught her that stereotypes could be very wrong. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not your fault, so don't be sorry if you don't have anything to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be sorry for who I chose to be sorry for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember the Gargoyle I told you about? Did you request him as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... there are lots of Gargoyles named Vatican however so it wasn't easy to find <br />
the right one you meant... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also... something changed recently... we have another tagalong, a nun I know who <br />
managed to win over my promise she could help us hunt the three witches...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me you're joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's spent years preparing for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn't think to tell me?&quot; Fire came out of Draco's mouth, the bandages cover his <br />
mouth blacken.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think she'd reach the threshold she could defend herself, I was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I REALLY don't like being kept in the dark, in particular since I'm the one helping -you-.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I apologize.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you keeping any other secrets from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Marie said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I trust anything you've told me so far then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... I promise to tell you everything once we're on the way to the New World. I swear to <br />
God that the witches as far as I know do exist, and they are as great a threat as I have told <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco sighed. &quot;You're not making this easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to write some letters to some friends of mine before we go. They should at least <br />
know what happened to me if anything happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're telling them about the witches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am, maybe I am not. You keep things from me, I'll keep things from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie said nothing, &quot;There one more detail you, we, need to add to that request of yours, <br />
and we need to do so very VERY fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You are going -where-?!&quot; Abbess Mary declared looking at the letter then at the two nuns <br />
in front of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;To the New World to teach the savages God's true word.&quot; Kathrine said nodding her head <br />
and smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don't believe this! They can't just pick you up like chess pieces and place you <br />
someplace else! And without even speaking to me before hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright Sister, really it is.&quot; Marie bowed. &quot;This is were God needs us to be. Who are we <br />
to refuse that call?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Very well but... I want you to know I'm proud of both of you. I am sad to see you go, as <br />
I'm sure your other Sisters shall as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I doubt that.' Marie thought simple. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Zoey was a blubbering mess of tears as Alaba gently hugged the small human from <br />
behind. &quot;You CAN'T GO! It's not fair!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kathrine and Marie looked at each other stunned. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to go to see so many new places! See so many new people! I wanna go too!&quot;<br />
<br />
'Of course.' Marie said simply, &quot;Zoey that's impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then just stay here! I'm sure we'll go lots of books on what it's like there soon! I'm sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie and Kathrine looked at each other again. <br />
<br />
Marie realized she had stereotyped more than just species. Zoey had always just been a <br />
set of ears and a mouth... there had never been a person. Marie looked at her, REALLY <br />
LOOKED at her, with her eyes that told her MUCH MORE than the one that just showed <br />
what there was to see. <br />
<br />
Marie hugged her fellow bride of God and whispered in her ear, &quot;Zoey. You can't go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; She sobbed. <br />
<br />
Marie whispered, &quot;Because... you're going to be Abbess one day.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zoey's eyes widened. <br />
<br />

<br />
1687 Between The first day of Christmas and New Years. <br />
<br />
The female felman opened the letter and read it. It wasn't addressed to her per-say, but it <br />
was addressed to her family.  She had dark blue fur with tiny white spots on her back that <br />
only her husband ever saw. She was cool, calm, and collected, as was to be expected by <br />
felman tradition given her fur color. Unlike her sister who was bright red with orange <br />
accents that forever embraced her passions. And her other sister who fur colors correctly <br />
predicted she was happy, friendly, and willing to make friends with anyone (there were <br />
times the female felman wished she had the nature her other sister had). <br />
<br />
Her two older sons were playing on the floor, while her youngest son was in one arm as <br />
she read the letter in the plush chair she was in, a forth child waiting to be born in her <br />
belly. Having given birth so many by felman standards had earned her the nickname 'Lucky <br />
Star' by her family, husband and friends. <br />
<br />
When she read who it was from, she resisted the desire to break out in dance and song as <br />
that was improper to her fur color. Then she had to resist the urge to cry as that was <br />
improper to her fur color as well. <br />
<br />
'I haven't seen Kathrine since our mama died of the plague... ' Like the father of the <br />
Prodigal son, 'Lucky Star' wasn't thinking of years distant, she was thinking of seeing her <br />
again. <br />
<br />
&quot;What does it say mama?&quot; Asked her son in her arms dressed only in shorts and a <br />
pendant. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to go meet your auntie Kathrine dear...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Auntie who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very wonderful rainbow-fur.&quot; 'I need to tell all the others!'<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Kathrine had already sent the letter to her family before the duel even began?&quot; Betty <br />
asked surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was very confident that she'd be able to win. And it would take that long just for the <br />
letter to make it. It took most of her nerve just to put the pen to paper. She didn't know <br />
that technically transport would have already been arranged. It turned out to be all for the <br />
best however for what her family provided would get them across the ocean much faster... <br />
And Kathrine going to the New World would actually inspire some of her nieces and <br />
nephews to ultimately come to the Americas and, of course, being their inspiration, they'd <br />
ultimately come to Glendale and Frostvile and Salem being the first Felman besides <br />
Kathrine in the New World.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
With the epidemic, only the desperate or the reckless were visiting Glendale these days. <br />
The children who had been born due to their siblings being forgotten by their parents <br />
after becoming Golden Deer, fairies, animals, statues or dolls now struck by the witches as <br />
well.  Some acted like Olga after their change. Other acted like animals. Other were simply <br />
insane. Joella was saddened, scared, worried, and outright fearful at what was happening. <br />
For every child that acted better, there was nine who were suffering horribly by the <br />
Wandering Demons. <br />
<br />
Joella of course had no library to go to, since no public libraries existed yet in the colonies. <br />
But there were generous families with a good amount of books who she easily won over <br />
via her sheer personality and no geass given to her by her friends/foster parents (Joella <br />
due to only having the memories of what the witches knew of her, only knew her old family <br />
wasn't around anymore even before she lived in Glendale, though she didn't know where <br />
she had lived before Glendale, but none of that mattered because she was happy and had <br />
friends). <br />
<br />
This generous family was one of the Leoman who had lost a daughter to the madness who <br />
was now a little lunatic who needed to have an eye on constantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was a fairy princess.&quot; A girl wish glasses said reading a copy of MidSummer <br />
Night's Dream with a small number of boys and girls around her who couldn't read <br />
listening to what she said.  Joella saw their clothes didn't look all that clean. Neither did <br />
those of the adults nearby. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'd be your fairy prince.&quot; Said one girl playfully teasing. <br />
<br />
Joella knew fairies were real of course. Two dozen lived near and around the house she <br />
lived with her Best Friends (a result of nearly a decade and a half worth of work by the <br />
witches) and were her friends as well. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What became of the people who the witches failed to make into Joella and made into <br />
figurines to clean up the evidence?&quot; Casandra had to know. <br />
<br />
&quot;They eventually evolved in their little prisons into totem spirits, or good luck charms <br />
they'd be called now, whose were able to keep nightmares away from even the most <br />
trouble child. The fairies gave the figurines all little fae wings on their backs as a fair-well <br />
gift to them before they departed from the witches before Marie and her crew arrived. <br />
<br />
Betty thought of one such an item she had seen once for sale in a antique shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Joella began down the path of good intentions to Hell too?&quot; Maddex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely... unlike her parents, Joella made crystal clear first that these children knew <br />
what they were singing up for and that there would NOT be a receipt to return to the store <br />
if they chose being naked, tiny, with wings, and their brains practically swimming in magic <br />
wasn't for them after a while. Joella was after all, how the witches thought of themselves, <br />
not how they actually were.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So she asked her mothers to turn these kinds into fairies? After the witches had <br />
abandoned the idea of fairies being a good option for eternal childhood?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not. Joella had no idea the fairies that existed, even if the fairies didn't <br />
remember, were creations of the witches. So she'd ultimately ask the fairies themselves for <br />
this favor.&quot;</p>
