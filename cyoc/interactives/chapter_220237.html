<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were going out for the usual jog with your gray shirt, gray sweat pants, and running shoes. Then you noticed an area that’s not been looked at… thinking of living things up, you decided to check it out… But it closed with a gate, fortunately there’s a gap big enough for you to go through…<br />
<br />
So…<br />
<br />
You went through the bars… you’re thankful that you are so skinny. You being 6’1, and 190 lbs. is a testament of your commitment of staying fit. ‘You’d be the man you are meant to be!’ As they say. Not sure you believe in that sentiment, but oh well… It got you this far!…<br />
<br />
And as you look around not finding anything of interest, you decided to go home. Then you hit something with your foot. Something shiny, and gold…<br />
<br />
A Magic Lamp!<br />
<br />
Or you think it’s magical, because it resembles the lamp from the movie Aladdin, ‘Oh that was a good movie.’ You thought.<br />
<br />
But for all you know it just a regular oil lamp, that happens to resemble it. And it’s not magical at all…<br />
<br />
But still you want to entertain it for the sake of it… And you decided to rub the lamp!<br />
<br />
As you rub the lamp, and thinking that nothing will happen… You just about to drop it, and leave… Then suddenly! The lamp started shaking!<br />
<br />
You’re baffled! This whole magical genies are only in the movies you thought… But now this seems legit!<br />
<br />
“What the?… That-!… I thought this is NOT REAL!”<br />
<br />
But it’s real… It’s SO real!…<br />
<br />
The lamp keeps shaking, and shaking, as smoke comes out of it… PINK smoke! Just as you try to comprehend what’s happening, the smoke starts forming a figure, a very FAT figure… And it  Reveals to be A Genie!<br />
<br />
This a male fully-figured genie with pink skin, wears light blue Arabian clothes as well as a turban, and also sports a dark brown Beard, and has thick body hair on his Arms, and Chest, except for his Belly, which is a Big Ball Gut with smooth skin. As for his lower half, is just a trail of pink smoke that leads to the lamp. And his face, is like a friendly fat uncle… Ready to give you a hug, and grant wishes!<br />
<br />
“Oh man! How is it possible to find a genie in a place like this?!” You say out loud. And the genie smiles<br />
<br />
“Hello Master, you are simply lucky to have found my lamp. Especially since you are so skinny, and you deserve to meet me!” The genie said.<br />
<br />
You look at him. “What do you mean by that?… You know what… Screw it! Just tell me! Is this a limited amount of wishes?”<br />
<br />
The genie shakes his head earnestly, he appreciates your eagerness… “There’s no limit on wishes, But there are conditions to what you’re allowed to wish for such as-…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Yeah! Yeah I know! No killing, no bringing people back from the dead, or make people fall in love with me! That whole deal!… Now then… I wish for to you take me back to my house!” You say without much thought.<br />
<br />
And just then with the snap of his fingers, you and him are back to your house. Which you’re living alone. Which is good. That means no one will interrupt you when you’re about to have fun with your wishes…<br />
<br />
The fact that you just got teleported from the gate, to your home, like magic! “Agh! Why does my pants feel so tight?”<br />
<br />
And as you check yourself to see if anything’s change… That’s when you discovered that you’ve just gain a small belly! <br />
<br />
That can’t be?! I know that was never there before! You look at your belly, and you start shaking it with distraught! You assume you’ve gain 215 pounds!<br />
<br />
THIS FEELS REAL!?!<br />
<br />
“Wha- Where did this come from!?!”<br />
<br />
You look at the genie who was shaking his head smiling… “Well Master I tried to tell you but you were so quick to make a wish, that you didn’t consider what my conditions are!”<br />
<br />
You are confused “But I thought-!”<br />
<br />
“You weren’t wrong about the rules you’ve mentioned. However! Those aren’t the only conditions I have…” You put the lamp on the counter, and the genie is now with his own pare of legs, wearing white Arabian pants that looks so airy, and of course, his legs have to be so thick that they can definitely support his weight. <br />
<br />
And so he continues…<br />
<br />
“I’m a Weight Gaining Genie! I’m here to fulfill a Gainer’s dream of being Big, and Fat! Any wish I grant that not weight gain related, they receive 25 pounds of fat in they’re body. And they will keep gaining until they are satisfied with their fatty selves… Or until there at a point of almost losing their mobility, which I don’t force them to be in unless they want it.” The Pink Fat Genie says.<br />
<br />
Why is he even a thing?!? Why in the world would anyone want to be fat on purpose!?!<br />
<br />
“Genie, I think you got the wrong idea of me… I don’t want to be fat! Can you please reverse this?” I asked hoping that there’s still a chance.<br />
<br />
“I sorry Master, that’s not something I can simply reverse. And no… Actually have a pretty good I idea of you, if you didn’t want to change your life, then you wouldn’t have found me. And here you are, you found me!” He’s smiling, unaware of how agitated you are right now!<br />
<br />
‘Why did I even bother to rub that stupid Lamp!?!’<br />
<br />
“Okay! I’ll go the gym then! Get rid of this stupid weight!”<br />
<br />
“Oh Master! If you want to go the gym to get yourself a muscle-gut, or a muscle-chub, then that’s all good! But if your intent is to lose the weight you just have. Then you’re going to have a bad time, because no matter how much you work out this fat of yours will stay with you. Your Belly… Is now apart of you… And if you try to lose that then you will die…”<br />
<br />
“…But don’t get discouraged… This weight you’ve received is a gift to you. And it’s healthy fat, so you are not going to die of any diseases. But you will die if you are underweight, so maintain your weight!”<br />
<br />
And now you are depressed. If you were to keep wishing for anything you will be so fat that will make it so you can’t do any activities on your own…<br />
<br />
“Hey Master! If it’s any consolation. If you say ‘I want to be 300 pounds’ that’ll make it so that way, moving forward you’ll won’t gain any weight beyond that… And you can wish for anything else!”<br />
<br />
You look at as if to a say ‘Are you really telling me this now?!’<br />
<br />
“Why can’t I just say that ‘I want to be 200 pounds’ and not have to deal the inevitable struggle of carrying my own weight? I mean I don’t want to lose my ability to look at my feet without bending over…” The genie looks at you weirdly<br />
<br />
“I’m a proud fat genie! I love my belly…” he says while rubbing it “… You should not be ashamed of having a belly of your own! And also why would you want to look at your feet? There’s nothing special about that. In fact I barely show my feet.”<br />
<br />
You glare at him… It’s clear he doesn’t get it! If you want to get out this you have to a way around it. Or if you want to accept your fate then you’ll have to learn to how to live with it!…<br />
<br />
It looks like the pink genie, he is not going anywhere, so to make sure you don’t forget you say the words that even makes you cringe: “Genie, I want to be 300 pounds.”<br />
<br />
The genie is grinning now “Perfect! Now is there anything I can do for you to make this weight gaining journey more enjoyable?”<br />
<br />
You give it a bit of thought…</p>
