<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach was what they call in the gay community a Bear, well some people <br />
call them Bears. He wasn't particularly furry, there was a bit of fur <br />
on his chest but he was getting fat from all the cum he was absorbing. <br />
A big beach ball belly, man tits, double chins, bubble butt, tree <br />
trunk legs and an appetite that was amazing. Not only food but sexual appetite. He became insatiable, knowing full well that it would go to <br />
his hips as he said.<br />
<br />
Weeks after weeks he swallowed the cum to keep him from turning back <br />
into a jock strap.<br />
<br />
Barry, another bear in the sense that Zach was a bear, invited Zach <br />
back to his place one evening and they cuddled and made out, which was <br />
becoming more and more difficult for Zach since his cum bloated body <br />
was less able to accommodate a penis up his ass and his cheeks seemed <br />
to have trouble with some men, particularly fat men that didn't extend <br />
very far past their belly apron. And Barry didn't extend very far. But <br />
they were like a couple of pigs. Barry riding Zach's ass as best he <br />
could not ever even penetrating him but dribbling down his ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
Being big men they both got winded quickly and passed out waking in <br />
the morning to Zach in the throws of changing. He needed 4 loads from <br />
Barry quickly or he would become a jock strap. He started sucking <br />
Barry's tiny cock for all he was worth burying his face in Barry's <br />
belly trying to find his cock but he was only able to get two more <br />
loads before it was time and he became a super sized jock for Barry to <br />
wear. He remembered what he had been told and felt his body stretching <br />
to encircle that 70+ inch belly and straps that seemed stretched to <br />
hold the dick holder properly.<br />
<br />
When Barry looked down at the new jock strap he was stunned to see <br />
Zach's change. <br />
<br />
What the hell happened he ask to no one.<br />
<br />
He wondered if there was any way to change him back but he didn't have <br />
the knowledge that Zach had and had never met Emery so there was <br />
little chance of him finding out the secret to changing Zach back. So <br />
he had a new jock strap and as he wore it he recalled the strangest <br />
sex he had ever had.<br />
<br />
Wearing Zach all the time till he became thread bare and stretched out <br />
from the ever increasing girth of Barry's belly.<br />
<br />
Barry left Zach at a gay bath house, realizing that he didn't fit any <br />
more but it was more of an absent minded loss of the jockstrap.<br />
<br />
One of the cleaning staff found it and started using it to mop up the <br />
loads of cum spilled everywhere. The new 380 pound Zach would take a <br />
lot more cum to bring him back to human and the bath house was the <br />
right place for this to happen. And it did almost a year later when he <br />
found himself laying in a heap in the janitors closet flopped over the <br />
utility sink. His naked body having absorbed more than enough for him <br />
to become human. Zach pulled himself out of the sink and grabbed the <br />
largest towel he could find and waddled out of the closet, finding the <br />
bath house as full as he had ever seen it. He quickly swallowed 5 <br />
loads before he left and his last memory was of a man by the name of <br />
Barry. He did have some memory of his last location and he tried to <br />
find it but there was just some guy there. Zach panicked and started <br />
to cry and being in the gay district the stranger asked Zach in to <br />
comfort him. Sitting him down on the sofa and putting his arm around <br />
Zach. <br />
<br />
It's ok we can try to find him. This man was a chubby chaser and he <br />
liked this big man who stumbled onto his front door step. He grabbed a <br />
pair of lycra shorts and they squeezed them onto Zach and put a 2xl t-<br />
shirt that looked like it was going to pop off of him but Zach felt <br />
better being somewhat clothed.<br />
<br />
Zach told this guy the whole story. His need for cum 5 times a day or <br />
he would turn into a jock strap and then he would have to start over <br />
again. This man seemed to be listening but thought Zach was delusional <br />
but that was ok he thought it would be fun to play with this chub and <br />
this way he would get to use Zach as much as he wanted and Zach would <br />
be told he needed to do it to stay human.<br />
<br />
The guy, who Zach found out was a trainer at a Gold's Gym, was named <br />
Thomas. The contrast between Zach's body and Thomas' body was so <br />
drastic that no one would have believed they were together and Thomas <br />
would berate and humiliate Zach when in public about his weight but <br />
Zach grew to love this. It was a turn on for both Zach and Thomas in a <br />
sick way. They were together for almost 5 years before Zach even came <br />
close to turning back into a jockstrap and that was when Thomas <br />
realized what Zach had told him was true. So he made sure that Zach <br />
had plenty of cum to keep him human. He no longer would be fill with <br />
just 5 loads it was always at least 8 and some times more. Thomas <br />
would rent his &quot;pig&quot; our to other jocks that secretly had a lust for <br />
fat men. And Zach sucked it down and grew fatter and fatter to Thomas' <br />
desire.</p>
