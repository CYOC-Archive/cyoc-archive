<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-Many- people began to get strange e-mails and phone calls. And somewhere in <br />
Frostvile, Kat got a strange look in her eyes, and spoke what the messages were saying <br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Those who had been human, weren't a minute later. <br />
<br />
Elsewhere on TV, &quot;My Fellow Americans, Transform or Dare?&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Kurse got up, her body shaking, &quot;You seem to be under a misimpression, the witches and <br />
their familiar aren't super heroes inside a giant robot that is me. They literally CEASED TO <br />
EXIST and I was born as their successor! And I promised that I'd make victory so horrid <br />
you'd lament for defeat and I shall see to it! GET UP!&quot; Kurse held her head with a headache, <br />
&quot;OW! Dammit. Not that.&quot;  And when the commanding lunatic curses, that things aren't <br />
going to THEIR plan, when they're using a losing strategy... their usually means only <br />
trouble for the good guys. <br />
<br />
And just like that, all the wolves' hard work, all their injuries and sacrifices, were all in <br />
vain, as with that snarl from Kurse in the Curse World, the twin gems were back on their <br />
feet. the police cuffs aged a thousand years in a second and fell apart.<br />
<br />
Instead of attacking at once however. Then the twins all began to giggle. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're no fun! We need to teach you some manners!&quot; Said one Opal. <br />
<br />
Nicole and nearly all the others wolves gasped, they SPOKE? <br />
<br />
&quot;We're gonna beat you like we're super heroes!&quot; Said the second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Which one?&quot; Asked the first Opal who spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking the Flash.&quot; Said the second. <br />
<br />
&quot;I prefer Batman. He doesn't need super powers.&quot; Said the first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well the Flash keeps finding cool ways to use his one power of running really fast, so <br />
that's kinda cool too right?&quot; Asked the second. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They're so cute!&quot; Declared one Cobalt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blk! Boys are icky!&quot; Said the other one crossing her arms. <br />
<br />
That was when it hit the wolves for real. These twins, really weren't like Fran and Darla, <br />
they had not just separate but unique egos. This left Betty suddenly worried if her nephew <br />
could be restored to normal (even by wolf standards).<br />
<br />
But a second ago they had been attacking with all the ability of the worst and most <br />
incompetent kamakazi pilots in history! <br />
<br />
Laughing, one of Amber leapt onto Grace and crawled until she was between her and Hope <br />
and said, &quot;Transform or Dare! Turn to cheese!&quot; <br />
<br />
Instantly the shock wave to knock away anyone and negate any use of the game via Amy's <br />
blessings shot away the Amber twin, but she instead went &quot;WHEEEE!&quot; And rammed her <br />
head directly into Hope's gut, damaging secondary organs and cracking bones. The other <br />
Amber realized what her twin was going and leapt onto Grace's head and onto her back <br />
saying, &quot;Transform or Dare! Become a house!&quot; And was launched by the repelling right into <br />
Isebelle like a canon ball! <br />
<br />
Kurse swore and slurred at the three invaders in her universe, for not only removing <br />
Amethyst from her universe, but for making accidently the gem wolves now relatively sane <br />
ignoring how it was quickly turning the tide. <br />
<br />
The gem wolves laughing like they were kid at the play ground grabbed hold of the wolves <br />
made increasing absurd transform and dares from 'stand on one leg' to 'be a jellybean <br />
monster!' Amy's rune caused them and the curse to be negated and send them rocketing <br />
into the nearest flesh and blood wolf.<br />
<br />
Chaos is sadly -not- evil, it can't be good or evil by it's very nature, chaos was as just as <br />
likely to do good as evil. The only truly evil thing on the island was Kurse, still driven by <br />
the witch's petty and selfish revenge for Glendale rejecting their vision of a magically <br />
enforced anarchist society and the whole put to death for driving women, men and <br />
children stark raving mad (ie, liberating them from reason and logic).  <br />
<br />
And Grace and Isabelle had been VERY SURE they had been next to Amethyst a second <br />
ago, who was wondering what the heck was going on, only remembering a very very very <br />
wild party she had been attending up until a second ago. <br />
<br />
But since chaos in of itself wasn't evil, this meant of course the gem wolves themselves <br />
were just chaotic, not wicked. And Amy's kanji had been engraved only to protect from evil <br />
in of itself. <br />
<br />
The two Quartz leapt at Betty, one tackled her legs, the other grabbed her chest. their <br />
increased weight from being rock rather than flesh and blood set her off balance enough <br />
that she fell backwards. Then... they began to TICKLE her. Betty squirmed, then sniggered, <br />
then giggled, then burst out laughing, twisting her upper body this way, and twisting her <br />
lower body that way.. and in the blink of an eye, her body along with her split in two. <br />
<br />
The two new twins who were made of the same material as the two Quartz got up and <br />
looked at the two gem pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi. I'm Tebby!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Bethy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Said one of he Quartz. &quot;Can you help us? We're kinda in a bind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What bind?&quot; Asked Tebby tilting her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those them der adults wanna make our home BORING! While right now it's cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins who had been created from Betty looked around, the island was a twisted <br />
warped mess of total discord. &quot;Wha! It's super cool!&quot; Declared Tebby. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite pretty.&quot; Said Bethy reservedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you'll help us?&quot; Asked the second Quartz. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YEP!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right on!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two new gem twins instantly began to attack their fellows.<br />
<br />
The twins of Coral and Tourmaline swarmed Maxine from two sides, and began to tickle <br />
her as she toppled, she laughed till the volume reached the heavens... then she broke in <br />
two. <br />
<br />
Looking up at the other pink gem wolves down at them, the crytaline pink wolf said, &quot;Hi. <br />
I'm Xing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Ming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your names rhythm.&quot; Observed one of the Coral twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fun isn't it?&quot; Asked Xing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Nodded one of the Tourmalines. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help up?&quot; Asked Ming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Answered the other Coral who helped up Xing and Ming. <br />
<br />
&quot;This place...it is awesome!&quot; Said Xing looking at the entire island in the sick twisted mess <br />
it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's sooo pretty~...&quot; Said Ming in awe of the chaotic islandscape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you help us keep those adults from ruining our home? They want to make it <br />
predictable.&quot; Said the second Coral twin. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEP BET!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To da bitter end!&quot; <br />
<br />
And the twins born of Maxine joined the fight next. And the wolves suddenly found their <br />
best defense turned against them and being flanked as well as out numbered. <br />
<br />
Glass got up, and brushed herself up, cursing that the army of twins was doing a better <br />
job than she and her chimera friends had! She was indestructable, but turned out not to <br />
have the inhumane strength she should have, &quot;Mother's transformations are so sloppy.&quot; <br />
Glass thought. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
On the other side of the island, the female minotaurs swarmed Gary and Brian and Gabriel, <br />
trying to rape them, while the male minotaurs tried to do the same with Felicity who <br />
managed to castrate one as it tried to pin her down. <br />
<br />
Bernie actually let out a scream as she realized the pigs around her after several hungry <br />
bites were trying to eat her alive! <br />
<br />
MJ and Wanda came at the horse centaurs from behind, however, the monsters seemed to <br />
know where they were in a 360 radius and their entire upper torso twisted around and <br />
began to claw and bite at them. Then they took to the AIR and DROPPED them back onto <br />
the sand with a heavy grunt. <br />
<br />
The bears almost drew and quartered Bobbi pulling her in four directions, but the <br />
lionesses Sasha and Megan did a pair of duel jump kicks disoriented the beasts enough <br />
that Bobbi was able to free herself and actually drove her claws into one of their guts. <br />
<br />
Gary tried to maintain order, but the beasts were coming to full and complete melee. <br />
<br />
Jensen meanwhile, his eyes caught something he couldn't believe, there was no logical way <br />
he could have seen it, but on this island, that was the point. <br />
<br />
&quot;KAYLEE!&quot; The monsters actually seemed to PART WAY for him, closing up behind him as <br />
he went, he didn't notice. He didn't even notice Amethyst as she tried to ask him what she <br />
could do and actually pushed her aside. <br />
<br />
Jensen climbed up the twisting crag at lightning speed, faster than he should have been <br />
able to, but pitcher plants often did help the flies along. <br />
<br />
Jesen reached the top, neighboring where Amethyst had been dancing. He looked at the <br />
statue of his mate, &quot;Oh Kaylee, how did this happen... I'm just... &quot; as he touched touch the <br />
statue, his hands slowly stroked her stone breasts... He actions became docile... &quot;Yes...&quot; <br />
He looked at her smiling stone face, &quot;We... shall be together forever.&quot; Jensen wolfhood <br />
explored her lower stone opening, not resisting as her stone arms them closed around his <br />
sister, and the other two stone muses placed a hand on each side of his rears. He returned <br />
her embrace. &quot;Yes dear, I hear you, yes, you and I, no more worries, no more concerns, <br />
you and I... we can be together forever...&quot;<br />
<br />
And Jensen's body became solid marble and fused with the other three statues becoming <br />
a singular piece of art. His face showing peace and contentment to match Kaylee's. <br />
<br />
Darla limped foreword as she knelt down, having followed her mate through a WALL of <br />
humanoid grizzly bears, one of her arms hung useless at her side and one of her legs was <br />
throbbing, and there was that trail of blood she was leaving behind. <br />
<br />
She felt someone take hold of her and felt she was about to fall, and felt two large things <br />
press into her as well, guessing instantly who it was, &quot;Amethyst?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here Beta Female!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw two of Kaylee's clink use the cure on you... what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I want to know! ... I felt like I was on the best LSD trip of my life...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Jensen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot; Amethyst looks around, &quot;I think... I think Master and Alpha Female are ... there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla looked, and actually cried out in despair. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Chiyoye growls and snarled and tried to claw as the twins of Cobalt as they DANCED on her <br />
giant breasts, &quot;Ha ha! They're like giant pillows!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say more like giant marsh mellows!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't eat them, so they're more like pillows!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they're so soft and squishy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Chiyoye snarled as Yomato tried to strike them only for him to accidently strike <br />
Chiyoye instead as they leapt off and hug on the sides of her maternal material for a <br />
moment before clawing back on (digging into her flesh as they did so!). <br />
<br />
Yomato gasped in dishonor and shame but didn't have time much to think about it as <br />
Tebby, Bethy, and the twins born of Quartz tackled him and began to tickle him. <br />
<br />
The twins of Cobalt meanwhile, began to tickle Chiyoye's giant breasts. The process being <br />
carried out on any wolf still on the beach who hadn't been split into two separate entities <br />
yet. <br />
<br />
Riding on the back of Frontdoor Abbey exploded out of the black ocean, the glass pup <br />
riding on the beast's giant backside. Backdoor, and the other female gargoyles followed <br />
suit, all of them now engraved with Amy's kanji. <br />
<br />
Whatever their loyalties were now, whatever their opinions were now, the wolves still had <br />
no idea, but the living statues clearly didn't want a world filled with aimless meaningless <br />
chaos either, and DOVE into the gem twin army, who found out much to their shock that <br />
the gargoyles were immune to tickling being living mineral like they were. <br />
<br />
The surviving wolves gasped in relief, their sides aching they had been laughing so hard. <br />
Millie turned on her side seeing the twinified Ting and Xing having her heads smacked <br />
together by one of the gargoyles only rise up a moment later, but the gargoyles were very <br />
effective at their work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Millie thought, &quot;We don't need to win this... we just need to keep the curse so <br />
distracted that Amy and the rest can kill the consciousness.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;RAAAAGH!&quot; Abbey turned as Glass wrapped her hands around Abbey's neck and dive into <br />
the mirror world. <br />
<br />
Underwater, but being able to breath all the same, the black and red rune covered dress <br />
didn't anymore  getwet than Abbey's white and blue one. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU RUINED EVERYTHING! You're a child like me! You should understand right sister?! We <br />
were all going to be free! FREE! To do whatever we want! To have whatever we want! To be <br />
anything we want! Mother just wants pure and absolutely freedom for everything and <br />
anything! No more rules! No more rules! No more rules!!! Don't you hate rules?! Imagine! <br />
the entire world could be Wonderland! Wouldn't that be fabulous sister?!&quot; Glass ranted and <br />
raved she tried to strangle the life out of Abbey while trying to win her over at the same <br />
time, in her insanity figuring that trying both at the same time was a really good time <br />
saver... She really would have fit in Wonderland's 'logic.' <br />
<br />
The gargoyles meanwhile, were suddenly hit by a herd of charging dear monsters, the <br />
gem twins immediately began to ride them, Xing grabbing Ting when she almost fell off. <br />
Some began doing head stands and other stood up with their arms apart like they were at <br />
the circus coming at the surviving wolves for another go. <br />
<br />
Not knowing how many of them were left in the chaos or how many had lost theirs during <br />
the fights Millie shouted, &quot;The herd! Throw the cure vials at the herd now!&quot; As Millie threw <br />
hers, which hit the beast right in the face, which by luck happened to be Jack. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, they're so wrapped up in their epic battles they've completely forgotten about <br />
that cursed poison they're all carrying... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This ends now.&quot; Amy spoke Alice's transform or dare.<br />
<br />
Instead Kurse punch her across the face discarding magic for the moment for good old <br />
fashioned violence. <br />
<br />
Amy was knocked down. <br />
<br />
&quot;I sense everything anyone touched by my power senses now. After I first lost glass I took <br />
precautions to make sure your little trick didn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring Trevor was proving to be a big mistake as the black and gray lion boy bit into <br />
Kurse's tail making her snarl. <br />
<br />
&quot;CHEAP SHOT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say fighting evil with evil only results in more evil, like I heard in a cartoon. But <br />
seriously psycho-beotch? I don't give a blank.&quot; <br />
<br />
It made her forget about Amy again who shot her in the shoulder from behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like any killing, but you're already dead.&quot; Amy said simply. <br />
<br />
The arrow burned like the sun as Kurse tore it out, burning her hands in addition.<br />
<br />
Paul then climbed on top of the now sixteen foot tall distracted black cat woman like she <br />
was a tree, and used his crucifix as a garrote, Paul wasn't sure if this was disrespectful or <br />
not, but since it was for a good cause, he figured God would forgive him. <br />
<br />
The flesh around Kurse' neck melted and she coughed up blood. Her claws dug into the <br />
sides of the orange great ape, taking fur and flesh with it. But Paul held up. Kurse gagged <br />
and coughed. Finally she grabbed him and threw him  off his body hitting and being nailed <br />
to an upside down cross (his hands being nailed together while his 'feet' were nailed apart <br />
as the blood  rushed to his head).<br />
<br />
Amy shot an arrow right into Kurse's knee cap as Trevor frantically got to work on tearing <br />
the nails out (which grew barbs as he worked on them). Kurse tore the arrow out as he <br />
burned flesh remained and roared. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what happened to the first generation of Christian converts in japan?&quot; Kurse <br />
asked Paul. &quot;They were exterminated by the japanese government.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul ignored her truthful, but obvious attempts at divide and conquer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop that Trevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor startled from his work as he turned around to see, &quot;Queen?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop that dear, don't you know a world with no rules means no one has to obey the <br />
laws of death or staying dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen! I-&quot; Before Trevor could explain he had let her go, 'Queen' clawed at his gut <br />
spilling blood, then 'Queen' at lighting speed zoomed back to Kurse 'her' tail connecting to <br />
Kurse, the Queen decoy melting back into the end of kurse's tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit...&quot; The black and gray lion cub cursed as he fell to his knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, no rules means no right or wrong,&quot; 'Said' Kurse creating a decoy of Judas <br />
making it speak, &quot;No right or wrong means nobody does anything bad or good, which <br />
means there's no need for a heaven or hell. Isn't it time to free this naturally chaotic <br />
universe, all the way to the subatomic it's blindly chaotic, yet God insists on imposing a <br />
illusionary sense or oder on it.&quot;  The decoy dissolved and Kurse snapped her claws. <br />
<br />
In the curse world a solar eclipse suddenly happened (strange since there hadn't been a <br />
sun before) and Ami suddenly someone had cut an umbilical cord she didn't even known <br />
she had. She still stood however, breaking out in sweat on her nose. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Fox.&quot;  Said the midnight lioness to her dirty orange/dirty red partner. <br />
<br />
The two were back to back kicking and clawing the minotaurs that got close and nearly <br />
having their heads taken off by a sky diving centaur beast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Elise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We promised Brian we'd protect Trevor with our lives right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Fox replies grabbing hold of a minotaur's massive hands as it almost went right <br />
through her and twisted the monster so it fell on it's side. <br />
<br />
&quot;But we can't protect him because he's in that world of the Curse's mind or whatever... or <br />
the part of him that matters at least...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he's part of the pride now, part of our future, and well... I know we have our mission <br />
but... I think I know how we can REALLY distract that curse, but you aren't going to like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it's likely to distract it enough to protect Trevor right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that's all I need to know.&quot; Elise and Fox hated to admit it, but there was more to <br />
their transformation than a species change, as Serenity had warned them.  Elise and Fox <br />
both were feeling and worrying about Mary and Trevor's safety as if they were their own <br />
children... and while they had all accept The Game as real, and were fellow police, they <br />
didn't mean they liked each other. But Fox felt as deep a bound with all of them as she did <br />
her blood relatives... she couldn't bear to see them harmed or bring them harm... 'I guess <br />
we're not quite like normal lions with human intelligence after all. Wonder if this is the <br />
'civilized' part of our transform... not that it's about to matter in a second here.' <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I'm thinking?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Unless it's to do the highland fling while whistling show tunes? Then yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right then.&quot; The two lionesses leapt over the minotaurs rammed into a centaur, <br />
crackled some ribs and kept going, ending with a bloody leg as they ran. Their police belts <br />
and what not all losted in the chaos, naked and free the two lionesses climbed onto the <br />
craig from the opposite end Darla and Amethyst were on, and to the alter the gem wolf <br />
had been doing her dance. <br />
<br />
&quot;You ready?&quot; Elise asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, let's do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! YOU STUPID DAMN CURSE! YOU'RE JUST A GLORIFIED PARODY OF A GAME BORED <br />
AND HORNY TEENAGERS PLAY! YOU GOT NOTHING! NOTHING! YOU COULDN'T CHANGE US <br />
EVEN IF WE LET YOU! YOU'VE GOT NO STYLE! NO BRAINS! NO POWER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;COME ON! GIVE US YOUR WORST! YOUR POSITIVE ABSOLUTE WORST! WE DARE YA!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE TRIPLE DOUBLE DOG DARE YA!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU CAN'T DO IT! NOT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LETTING YA BUT BECAUSE YER CHICKEN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THEN EVERYONE WILL SEE YOU GOT NOTHING! AND YOUR ISLAND IS UGLY! STUPID! <br />
GLADE I DON'T LIVE HERE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;COME ON! COME ON! COME ON COME ON!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;DODITDOITDOITDOITDOIT!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE WANT YOU TO! WE WELCOME YOU TO! WE ALLOW YOU TO! BECAUSE YOU STINK AND <br />

<br />

IS? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT NO IMAGINATION! WHY ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE EVERYONE ELSE <br />
COME UP WITH THE NASTY THINGS TO TURN PEOPLE INTO OR HAVE DO! LOSER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HACKNEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hackney? Hackney? HACKEY!!!!&quot; Kurse snarled at the top of her lungs. <br />
<br />
the entire cure world shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU LET ME IN? RAGH!&quot; And they hit upon the sore spot Kurse had left over from <br />
Gormorrah who she was born from. Her lack of creativity. &quot;I'll, show, you!&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Fox and Elise's breast grew from conservative to the size that they actually fell to their <br />
knees under the weight. Then their age became teenagers. Then they were both purple. <br />
Then they were identical. Then they broke down into eight little lion girls in maid outfits <br />
(no guesses were the extra mass came from). Then they forgot their own names. Then <br />
they forgot each other's names. Then everyone everywhere forgot they had ever existed as <br />
anything but what they were to become, be they pride, pack, or human. Two turned into <br />
living plushies, then two naked and a marble and a glass statue in pirouette and prancing <br />
poses. The plushie then lost their maid outfit in the progress one wearing a sowed on <br />
bikini and the other a plain white dress with etched smiles on their cloth lion faces. The <br />
plushies were picked up by two of the lion girls. The statues grew to a third larger than life <br />
but keeping their age and material, then they fused into a base, and the stone lioness <br />
began an endless stream of water from her mouth, the base becoming a basin for a <br />
marble and glass fountain.  The plushie divided into two bininki wearing and two white <br />
dress wearing plushies half the size of the four remaining lion girls, each picking up one <br />
knowing they were their favorite toy. Bright blue hair grew from the lionesses heads <br />
(rather illogical due to lionesses being 'baled') which then shaped it into a pony tail, pig <br />
tails, triple tail, and quad tails (two in front, two in pack) hair styles for each of the four <br />
little girl lioness maids. <br />
<br />
The four then sat down and began to have a tea party with their plushies talking about <br />
how pretty the island was and how cute Trevor was and hope Mary was willing to share <br />
him when they grew up. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;BYE-BYE! Your memory will fade even from those who are immune to the perception <br />
changes of the curse! HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT HUH? HUH? HUH? HUH? No one mourn you! <br />
But what am I doin' here talkin' to people who now never existed and could have never <br />
existed and will never exists? BAHAHAHAHH! LOSER! You don't even get to die! You aren't <br />
even dead! You two are just poof! GONE! AGH!&quot;  An arrow, more like a solid beam of light, <br />
went in one side of Kurse from her back, and out of the other going through through her <br />
heart.<br />
<br />
Kurse slowly turned around. <br />
<br />
Amy looked at Kurse, with total and absolute divine rage, that put the temper tantrum <br />
Kurse had just thrown to shame. Trevor held her out so she was able to shoot the arrow. <br />
<br />
Kurse took a step sideways out of the weakened priestesses line of sight, or meant to, as <br />
Paul threw his prayer beads like a bola, going around her legs with a will all it's own and <br />
increasing in size so it could hold her, she tripped and fell foreword, to the sound of <br />
thunder. <br />
<br />
She looked into Amy's eyes. Amy let lose another arrow. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
A psyche death cry echoed through every person the curse had effected. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;OW!&quot; Kat held her head, feeling like someone had pulled a knife out of her head, and as <br />
she brought her hands up to her head, she realized she could think clearly again: As did <br />
many MANY other people. <br />
<br />
Kat looked in the mirror to see a garish pink and white furred cat girl in a -very- revealing <br />
outfit with garish blue tribal upon and down one side of her arms and legs with a chest a <br />
tiny bit smaller than it had been. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I just got used to the tail and ears...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
A mundane black cat with a hole in it's head through one eye that showed the other side <br />
limp away from the dissolving black smoke in a desperate retreat. Trevor saw her, came <br />
up behind her, and without hesitation broken her neck. It went limp, dead, and dissolved <br />
into nothingness. And the curse, lost all sentience, all sapience, and any chance of <br />
becoming self aware again.</p>
