<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">with Sam witnessing the sight of Alyssa’s face beginning to be pushed out now, well, it was just her nose and the lower jaw really. as this was becoming whiter that small reddish hairs began sprouting just above her soon to be her snout. seeing as her lips were blackening that even her nose was leathering to become black also.<br />
<br />
“Wh-Whaaa…?” Alyssa moaned as she cried out. she noticed that her voice was already more raspier then normally.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Alyssa?” Sam started to say, before he nervously finished. “This is what I was trying to tell you about.”<br />
<br />
“Tellrhg, mmeeee, whaaa?” She managed to grunt out as the white fur spread more over on her front side of her body, while the red was spreading more over towards her back.<br />
<br />
“ah well... you see, it&#39;s the crackers. That’s what those things do, once you eat one of them. i&#39;m sorry, I’d forgotten about them until…” Sam began to say, before she jumps in as to what you were saying.<br />
<br />
“Yyyooooo, dighd, thiiiisssth?” sounding surprised to hear this, Sam started to have a guilty conscience. and yet, he knew that deep down inside for it was her own fault for eating one one of the animal cracker as to know what each one can do. she&#39;d did it without knowing to what these crackers can do.<br />
<br />
“I forgot!” Sam was shaking hard now for the sight of her shirt shifted that she slipped it off of herself. stretching as she was puffing out with Alyssa’s new fur while pushing into it’s confines, positively terrifyed him. “It wasn’t…until after you…said…you’d eaten it…before I remembered.” He added in a stuttering voice.<br />
<br />
“Urggghhhh…” Alyssa forced Sam’s grip off of her as she clenched her sides and dug in. Either she didn’t realize it yet, or she didn’t care about it, but her grasping of her claws while hunching over had torn her sides of her favorite black and green with blue strap sports bra as it still remained on her slender red-orange fur-coated back. her panties were made of the same silky spandex material her bra was as it was also stretchy enough to stay strapped on that her new fluffy appendage of a tail poked its way through the fur and above her cute furry ass for it was right under the strap of her underwear that her tail was wagging it wildly while it was out of control for only a few seconds of time, before it slowly started to settle down and relax from the excitement.<br />
<br />
At this point, Sam had his eyes squeezed shut while Bracing himself for the inevitable fallout. It was only several moments later however that he realized something wasn&#39;t right here. for one, he hadn’t been touched yet for Alyssa had also eaten a fox cracker instead of a dog that he did tentatively opened up one of his eyes to see why.<br />
<br />
Sam Finally begun to see that Alyssa was still sitting there next to him, staring at herself for it was then Sam noticed something unusual. Alyssa still had the head, tail, and fur of a red fox that she was actually smaller by one foot. however, her arms and legs were still somewhat like they mostly were before. compared to her length and torso to when she was mostly human that significantly, she looked like someone who&#39;s wearing a furry costume of a fursuit as Sam could tell to anyone he meets with her. yet he was seeing her as a humanoid anthropomorphic fox girl.<br />
<br />
Indeed, she wasn’t even that much larger, despite the damage to her figure as her shirt and pants were slipped off (the latter of which they were scattered over the floor and couch, alone with her socks for she carefully ripped them off her feet now) is where her boots were the only things damaged and torn off. before the changes that her boots would of been to her knees, although they were now stretched and puffed with seams torn as the toe area was now burst opened while making room for her paws. slowly, Alyssa rose back to her feet and took a number of tentative steps for Sam had to admit to himself that it was a little weird to see. seeing a grown fox girl walking around in their living room like a kid would when they take their first steps on walking that he had to ask something. <br />
<br />
“Uh…Aly-ssa?” He started slowly, catching her attention and almost making him freeze up. “H-How much of it…did you, eat?”<br />
<br />
“H-hhoww, mucchh?” Alyssa forced through her throat, doing her best to speak. she wasn’t really built for speech in this form just yet for she was talking in a language of a five year old now.<br />
<br />
“The fox Cracker? How much of it did you eat?” Sam asked again.<br />
<br />
“ohhh! Aboouuutt Hallfff.” she said for That would explained it to Sam. yet he was bothered for when she started to take off her underwear set in front of him.<br />
<br />
Not that Sam had a chance to voice it for one minute later, Alyssa closed the gap while staring hard into Sam’s eyes. as his fear escalated once more, shaking like a leaf that he was awaiting to whatever she saw fit to do to him. and yet, she started to kiss him with her tongue for he felt like being kissed from a dog. well, in a way as she was part dog for she looked more like a fox that calling her a hot fox would be an understatement.<br />
<br />
The sensation of her tongue running over his face wasn’t what he expected. yet while trying to wipe it off (until he found his arms pinned), he heard Alyssa speak as she yipped it out. “Yoouu could’vvvve, told, mrree.”<br />
<br />
though legibly as she settled back down while wagging her tail like a happy puppy that she shortly after pulled him up close into her soft furry chest she was suffering him with her hooters of melons as they had grown into C cups. “Burrrhhtt. Lluvvre, it. Srro don’t, fearrrr.”<br />
<br />
“Uh? Alyssa?” Sam was able to ask, once she let him breathe easy again. One of her paws was was now resting over his leg.<br />
<br />
“Yress?”<br />
<br />
“what should we do now?” he asked for it was A weak question that he knew. yet it was the best he could bring himself to ask.</p>
