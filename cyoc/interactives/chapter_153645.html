<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Someone named Thomas Payne.” explained Beth as Kim’s mouth dropped. “You know him?”<br />
“I know a Thomas Payne, yes he is Lisa’s boyfriend and kind of a jerk.” admitted Kim, in truth he was a jerk but he wasn’t a mean jerk to her or anyone else she had seen or heard. Just the normal Jock type of jerk who thought because he was the star linebacker on the football team and dating the head cheerleader, Lisa that he was King of the School. “Well maybe jerk is too strong of a word, he is full of himself but a lot of jocks are. He looks down on people but he never seamed to go out of his way to be mean to anyone that I knew about unlike others.”<br />
“Well, he came down with the flu and is already transforming into a Nymph he will be arriving in two hours.” explained Beth as she looked at Kim. “You know he will be rooming with you know?”<br />
Kim blinked and looked at the spare bed and other items, each room was set up with two beds and the like but a lot of them only housed one person. She assumed that was because they didn’t have a lot of people transforming at the moment.<br />
“They like to house people transforming into the same type of monster together…give them support and the like.” Explained Jess as she took a breath crossing her arms over her chest. “You better go into more detail about Thomas, it would be best if I know what I will be dealing with. I think I will be the one helping him the most. I have walked down this path before.”<br />
That took Kim aback, until she remembered that Jess used to be James, she was the only man to become a Nymph but that seemed to have changed if Thomas was becoming a Nymph he was becoming a she. <br />
Thomas Payne sat in the passenger seat of his own car; the doctors wouldn’t let him drive himself because concerns about emotional issues. He looked down at himself and felt like crying and he understood why the doctors would say that. The night before he had gone to bed tired and shore but that was because of multiple days of working out he had assumed. He was wrong, he woke up to find that his height had dropped almost 3 inches going from 6’4 to just over 6’1 foot and his cloths where loser, his muscles seemed less define, his brown hair was longer and worse of all his dick had shrunk. <br />
“So Lisa didn’t take the news well.” said his friend Mike as he drove the car, Mike was wearing a medical mask and even plastic gloves. Some people still foolishly believed that the monster virus could be passed by people turning. <br />
“She broke up with me on the spot. It didn’t even get past the fact that I came down with the monster virus, once she heard that she told me to go screw myself and to never contact her again.” answered Thomas in a pained voice, which was higher then he ever thought his voice could go. “My parents where a little better but not much, you know them.”<br />
“Yes, religious as hell believes the Monster virus is punishment for the sinful.” Stated Mike as they got off the highway as the center loomed up in the distance. <br />
“They said they will allow me to keep my trust to pay for school but I am no longer to contact them and they highly recommend I change my name once the turn is done.” explained Thomas as they pulled into the driveway of the center. “Well I’ll park the car in the centers parking lot and catch the bus back.”<br />
“Thanks man, I owe you one.” said Thomas as he got out to find multiple doctors waiting for him. He had no suitcases or anything else, there hadn’t been time to pack anything so beside his wallet, phone and cloths on his back he had nothing. <br />
“Don’t worry about it, in fact don’t tell anyone. If they find out I was in your car they may think I have the flu and not speak to me.” stated Mike as he drove off without so much of a word. By now it was nearing four in the afternoon and he was rushed inside where they did a lot of medical tests, explaining that they would have done this before the change had he not ignored the signs. Finally, near 7 at night he was lead to his new living arrangements. He walked in to find three of the most beautiful women he had ever seen sitting at a small table playing cards with an attractive women of about his own age.<br />
“Ah…you must be Thomas.” Said one of them as she stood up. “I am Jess, formally James and I will be the one helping you the most however all of us will help you.”<br />
“I am Sally.” introduced the more business type dressed on.<br />
“I am Beth.” introduced the other<br />
“Hello Thomas.” said the younger one “How did Lisa take the news? Not well knowing her?”<br />
“How did you know who Lisa was?” inquired Thomas<br />
“I know I have changed but I thought I hadn’t changed that much.” said Kim as she stood up. “It’s me Kim, Lisa’s roommate and like you I am becoming a Nymph.”<br />
“What?” inquired Thomas “Lisa said you left school, she was bragging about having a room to herself.”<br />
“I lied to her.” Explained Kim <br />
“What do I have to look forward to? Has any guy ever become a Nymph before?” inquired Thomas as Jess raised her hand.<br />
“Your looking at her and if you are on day 1 of your change, then tomorrow will be your last day as a man.” Explained Jess as Thomas stiffened.<br />
“I thought the changes took a week?” inquired Thomas<br />
“For most not all.” Countered Jess “It takes only three days for us and on the morning of the 4th you get your powers.”<br />
“Powers?” inquired Thomas<br />
“You really haven’t read anything have you?” inquired Sally with a sigh. “Well this did just fall on you.”<br />
“You will gain a power of the element, fire, water, wind, earth, lightning, light or darkness.” Explained Beth as the three Nymphs gathered balls of energy around each of their hands. Before letting it go. “You will also not really age past young 30’s, I am in my 40’s and Sally is in her 50s and Jess is in the late 30’s and you can see how we look.”<br />
“I see.” said Thomas not really sure what else to say. <br />
“Also you will be immune to STD but you will not crave sex like a succubus but like a succubus a nymph can get pregnant from a same sex relationship.” Explained Jess as Thomas nodded his head.<br />
Over the course of the next few hours they talked, until it was time for the three mentors to leave. The doctors had left them stay longer then normally allowed because of late arrival of Thomas but they had to leave and Thomas and Kim where alone in their room. <br />
“So what will change tomorrow?” inquired Thomas as he looked down at his body.<br />
“We will find out tomorrow.” Said Kim not sure what will happen to herself.</p>
