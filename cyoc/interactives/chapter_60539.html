<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had stripped out of his pajama sweats. Now naked, he put Dre on first.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, he's toasty warm like fresh out of the dryer,&quot; Jeff chuckled. <br />
<br />
He pulled on the t-shirt next.  The shirt was long enough to cover the top of his jockstrap, but the end kept <br />
rolling up until Jeff's belly button was visible.  He pulled it to down three times and then chuckled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Miguel, you still have some control?  Or is that how you imagined me with my belly button showing? Well, no <br />
matter, I know how to fix this,&quot; Jeff said as he tucked Miguel inside Dre's waistband, and chuckled.  He <br />
modeled in front of the mirror, he did look fine.<br />
<br />
Now it was time for the motorcycle leathers that were Eric. Jeff undid Eric's elaborate zippers and climbed <br />
into the suit. It was a tight fit.  At least the leather seemed to breathe, it felt alive as it hugged his <br />
calves and thighs.  He jumped with a start as it hugged his butt cheeks and filled his crack.  It slid over <br />
Jeff's arms like butter. He was surprised to discover the open finger gloves were attached to the sleeves but <br />
fit him perfectly.  He pulled up the zipper. It glided so easily. He had planned to stop midway up his chest, <br />
but the zipper seemed to have a mind of its own and slid all the way to the collar and then made a clicking <br />
sound. As soon as it clicked, all the straps on the leather suit seemed to draw tighter.  The stirrups under <br />
his feet tightened and pulled the leather hem of his pants legs down below his ankles. The leather suit seemed <br />
to shrink around Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I'm being shrink wrapped,&quot; Jeff said as he watched in the mirror as every detail of his body seemed to <br />
be visible through the tight supple leather hugging his body.  His eyes widened a bit when he realized he <br />
could see the ribbing on the jockstrap pouch pushing through the supple black leather of his crotch, and his <br />
erect nipples were visible on his chest through the leather. He rubbed his chin, and muttered, &quot;Hot, but a <br />
little gay.  Let's see what you typed, Eric.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned and tripped over Marcus, or at least the boots that had been Marcus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, almost forgot about you, Marcus,&quot; he said as he sat on the floor and pulled the right boot on his bare <br />
foot, &quot;Sorry, no socks today, hope you enjoy the smell. I hadn't planned on you being my shoes, but I hadn't <br />
showered yet today, so it worked out better than if I'd planned it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood, and admired himself in the mirror, &quot;Aw, dudes, I look so friggin' hot.  Now if only I had a <br />
motorcycle, I could cruise over to cheerleader practice and pick up -&quot;<br />
<br />
CLANG!<br />
<br />
The loud noise of metal weights clanging against the concrete interrupted Jeff's thought.  He went to the <br />
window and peered out.  There was his neighbor Chet, the 28 year old former marine pumping iron in his <br />
driveway right next to Jeff's driveway.  The guy was an amateur bodybuilder who had finished third in a <br />
national contest. He was hard at work honing his muscled body. Jeff rubbed his chin, and muttered, &quot;Chet would <br />
make a fine muscle hog, and I bet he's in range of the Chronivac down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff moved the antenna to the window sill and trained it down on Chet. He then sat down at his computer <br />
console and began typing.  He changed Chet's red black and gold Marine tattoos into flame shaped tats, changed <br />
the words on the American Eagle tattoo and chose the Harley-Davidson model and type. He remembered hearing <br />
that Chet had been born in Wisconsin, so a Harley seemed like the best choice.  The clanging of iron stopped <br />
suddenly. Jeff ran back to the window. <br />
<br />
Outside, Chet had been squatting and thrusting to lift 400 lb weights. Then he'd lower the weight with a clang <br />
to the concrete driveway and take a break.  His wife beater shirt was drenched with sweat and clung to his <br />
glistening muscled body. He had dropped the weights because of an odd tingling sensation on his upper biceps.  <br />
He now stared at what had been his Marine Corps tattoo, but now appeared to be racing flames like one sees <br />
painted on cars.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; he said clenching his teeth.<br />
<br />
A spark flew out of his mouth as the sound of steel grinding echoed from his teeth. He took two steps and <br />
dropped to his hands, but kept his feet on the ground.  Black rubber tires were forming between his hands and <br />
feet and lifting him off the pavement.  His cock was suddenly rock hard and growing longer and thinner.  It <br />
ripped through his shorts and came to a rest on the driveway supporting his weight. His dick was a kickstand! <br />
He tried to call out, but all he did was make vrooming sounds.<br />
<br />
Jeff rubbed his hands in glee as he watched Chet's clothing being reduced to rags for washing his new <br />
motorcycle. Chet's skin had already started to darken to a black metallic sheen and chrome detailing was <br />
visible like veins showing through his skin. But unlike veins they were moving together and thickening. Chet <br />
vroomed loudly. Jeff ran downstairs to move his new bike to his driveway. He grabbed Chet's ears - now <br />
handlebars and wheeled him over the grass ribbon that ran between the driveways of the two houses.<br />
<br />
Chet was all motorcycle now with his engine softly purring. Jeff climbed on to the seat of the bike straddling <br />
his former neighbor.  This change on the Chronivac had been permanent.  A for sale sign had already <br />
materialized in Chet's yard, and as Jeff watched Chet's heavy iron weights faded into oblivion. Jeff shook his <br />
head, he should have thought this out better.  He could have made some cash off Chet's stuff instead of simply <br />
making him non-existent. He shrugged.  He still had his motorcycle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'll take you for a spin in a minute, Chet,&quot; he said, &quot;But first I need a helmet. Don't want anyone <br />
driving off with you or wasting any more gas at these prices.&quot; So he grabbed the ignition key and turned it <br />
off.<br />
<br />
Mentally, Chet screamed.  The key sticking out of him had been his nuts. He felt them pull up into his body <br />
when his dick had elongated and he felt them moving under his skin up his chest around to the back of his neck <br />
where they resurfaced as the ignition key. It had felt like Jeff had grabbed his nuts, and then yanked them <br />
off. Chet had passed out.  Perhaps it was from his ignition being turned off, perhaps it was the psychic shock <br />
of being castrated? <br />
<br />
Jeff ran upstairs and was surprised to see his brother sitting at his desk with his hands on the Chronivac <br />
keyboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hey, Mark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice outfit, Jeff!&quot; Mark said with a gleam in his eye and a far too friendly smile.  His index finger punched <br />
the enter key, and Jeff felt an impending sense of doom.</p>
