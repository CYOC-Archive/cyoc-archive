<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No matter how many times they looked, neither Nathan nor Jodie could find their cars. After they&#39;d circled the lot a few more times, and finding a van from several decades prior parked where Nathan always left his vehicle and a pickup truck that was rusting from the frame up where Jodie parked her auto, Jodie handed the keys to car to Nathan. As he put the keys inside the purse he was carrying, Jodie huffed, &quot;Well, this is just great. What they hell happened to out cars?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they no longer exist because of what we were turning into,&quot; Nathan offered.<br />
<br />
Frustrated by this, seeing it as it meant they were turning into a couple dogs, Jodie muttered, &quot;Wonderful,&quot; before she said, &quot;I guess this means we&#39;ll be taking the bus instead,&quot; as her mind went back to how she&#39;d gotten to her grandmama&#39;s house the few times Nathan wasn&#39;t able to drop her off before he headed to work.<br />
<br />
With a deep inhale, Nathan gave her a rather dog-like grin and suggested, &quot;We could walk. It&#39;s a nice day out, and it smells so much better than it usually does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jodie didn&#39;t like to admit, but as she sniffed the air, she found that Nathan was right. There were so many interesting odours now, she literally wanted to start running after them, investigation each one. Restraining herself, she took a deep breath and weighed her options. On the one hand, the bus would get them to their destination quicker, whilst on the other, if they walked they could stop at the nearest department store first and buy some clothes that actually fit. Looking over at Nathan, about to ask for his opinion, she almost burst out laughing when she saw he had his tongue out, like he was panting. But then it hit her that the muscular organ she was seeing wasn&#39;t a human one, but rather a dog&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He was unaware of what he was doing, as well as what had changed. Sniffing the air, enjoying the scents coming from the trees, the ground, the vehicles, the animals that were hidden, it startled him when he suddenly could smell the alarm that was coming from Jodie. Focusing on her, Nathan cocked his head and inquired, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jodie repeated before she pointed at his mouth and stated, &quot;Your tongue is what&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s no longer human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand clapped to his mouth, Nathan tried to ask what was the matter, but the words came out muddled as he gripped the muscular organ. Feeling that it was different, yet still wanting a mirror to confirm it, he whimpered, &quot;Dammit. I can&#39;t go around with a dog&#39;s tongue. Especially if I start to pant like one,&quot; and unable to help himself, he began to do exactly that as he was overcome with a sense of anxiety and started to grow stressed with what was happening.<br />
<br />
Distressed by what she saw, heard, and could smell, Jodie grew worried as she speculated whether their transformations were speeding up. Jamming her hands in the jean&#39;s pockets, she was tempted to tell Nathan what he was doing. Instead, she said, &quot;So I guess we should take the bus. We&#39;ll get to my grandmama&#39;s house faster than if we walked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t go on the bus,&quot; Nathan whimpered and hugging himself, causing the shirt he had on to pull tight and show that his double A cup breasts had gone up to an A cup, he added, &quot;Not like the way I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jodie, the moment she saw the way the t-shirt pulled tight, revealing the growing breasts and that his nipples were erect, felt her penis slid from its sheath. Taking a shuddering breath, even if felt nice how the tip brush against the inside of the jeans, she struggled to ignore the sight before her and push away thoughts of seeing Nathan without a shirt on. Hundreds of different scents assaulted her now acute sense of smell and she tried to focus on any but what was coming from Nathan. After a moment, when her penis slid back into its sheath, she took another shuddering breath and stated, &quot;This must mean we&#39;re walking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan understood that by doing so it&#39;d take them longer to reach Patricija Lara&#39;s place, but he could see that the upside of it was that there&#39;d be less chance of an encounter with someone who&#39;d notice what was happening to him and Jodie. Letting his arms drop to his side, he self-consciously adjusted the strap of the purse and nodded as he answered, &quot;I guess we&#39;re walking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think we should stop at the department store on the way and get ourselves some better fitting clothes,&quot; Jodie told him.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t care for this idea, but saw the logic in it. Figuring he&#39;d have to work to keep his tongue inside his mouth, Nathan started to reach for the purse to check how much money was inside it, but stopped. Looking at Jodie and in an unsure tone, inquired, &quot;Um, should I use whatever you have in your purse and you use what I have in my wallet? Or should you take your purse now and I&#39;ll take my wallet,&quot; as he suddenly found it ludicrous that he was carrying such a thing, yet found it seemed so natural that he was.<br />
<br />
Hand gripped over Nathan&#39;s wallet, Jodie didn’t give it a second thought as she took the trifold out. Handing it to Nathan, Jodie reached for her purse as she did so, offering what she believed was the simplest solution of, &quot;Take what you need from the wallet, and I&#39;ll take what I need from my purse,&quot; and the two extracting whatever money, debit, and credit cards they had, Jodie clipped the car keys on the small clip inside the purse next to small clip that held the keys to the apartment before she handed the purse back to Nathan.<br />
<br />
Not sure what he should do with the money and cards he took from his wallet, Nathan eventually settled on stuffing them inside the purse. Hooking the strap over one arm, he didn&#39;t bat an eye when Jodie drew him close by throwing an arm around him. Comforted by her, he breathed in her strong, masculine scent, he put an arm around her waist as they strolled across the parking lot and turned in the direction they needed to go. Sniffing the air, listening to everything around him, trying to keep his tongue from lolling out, Nathan found himself getting a sudden new awareness as he thought he began to understood how a dog perceived the world around it. Finding the only thing that bothered him was that with way he was walking, it was hard to ignore that his genitals were between his legs as he felt the way the fabric of the jeans he had on brush against them, and that his chest now stuck outward and had four extra nipples, all six sensitive to touch, which made him glad how soft the fabric of the shirt was as it brushed softly against them.<br />
<br />
Next to him, Jodie was lost in her own world as she breathed in what she could only describe as a plethora of aromas. As she did this, she tried to ignore her own body, as her penis had once again slid from its sheath. Not hard, it existed in a state of between flaccid and erect as its sensitive tip brushed against the inside of the jeans. Thinking if she was able to wear a pair of underwear it might not be so bad, she was almost distracted also by the way her nuts shifted about, somethings briefly ending up pinched before they worked themselves free. Unable to help herself, she wondered if all guys experienced the issues she was, and how it was that they dealt with them. Wanting to ask Nathan about it, she found herself feeling shy, like it wasn&#39;t something you would talk about. Sniffing the air, smelling what seemed like a small animal hiding nearby, she tried to put it from her mind the problems she was having with her manhood, even as it came to her that, at some point between when they&#39;d sat down to breakfast and when they&#39;d left the apartment, her own breasts had gotten smaller, which left feeling mixed up inside as it came to her that she’d eventually be as flat chested as Nathan used to be.<br />
<br />
Each lost in their own thoughts, neither wanting to voice the concerns of what they were going through at the moment, they both felt content to hold each other as they strolled down the sidewalk. Had either been aware of it, both would have been taken aback when they each thought to themselves, &quot;I&#39;ll be glad when we find a way to put this whole damn mess behind me.&quot;</p>
