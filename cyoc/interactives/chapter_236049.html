<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann was looking at herself in the mirror almost in disbelief as Lisa and Kellie helped finish touching up her hair. The day had finally come when she and Jackie were to have their long awaited wedding and she couldn&#39;t feel happier about it. Both women were a little unsure what to think of inviting Jackie&#39;s parents to the wedding considering a few attendees might look a little older, but they went along with the fact that Ann is the youngest sibling in her family, that wasn&#39;t going to be a lie soon anyway. Ann invited her own parents to attend as well, although to again not raise Jackie&#39;s parents eyebrows, Martin and Marilyn O&#39;Toole were to attend the wedding in their Solar Guardian forms which they could thankfully change into regular clothes. Ann, Lisa, and and Kellie couldn&#39;t help but feeling a little jealous of their mom looking very beautiful in the dress she had changed into to stand alongside Martin. Due to Jackie&#39;s friends still having the disagreement over the vampire situation, they couldn&#39;t invite everyone to attend, although a few of their friends did visit some days prior to congratulate them. So Diane and Naomi had come together as well as Caleb and Gloria, who had yet to tie the knot.<br />
<br />
Most of Ann&#39;s family were going to be in the wedding with Lisa and Kellie as bridesmaids, although she chose Stephanie to be maid of honor considering how much she meant to Ann and Jackie. Lisa and Kellie were all too kind to let her sister have her adopted daughter as the maid of honor and Stephanie was overjoyed about it. She also had Morgan and Lynne as flower girls, both of their mothers thought they looked adorable. As for Jackie, she wanted her side to be the more manly side so she asked Travis to be the best man, as a little in-joke as Ann and Jackie knew Travis was hell bent on marrying Stephanie one day. She also had Caleb and Jack on her side just for a little simplicity. Katie and Kellie Carlson were also in attendance to see their adorable young daughter as a flower girl. Ann&#39;s sister, Kellie Pendragon was also there with Annie,Felicia, and her boyfriend Adam Haskins, who was there with his own agenda too to at least try and talk some sense into Caleb about Duke.<br />
<br />
Stephanie now came in dressed in her beautiful bridesmaid dress to check on her mother who was finishing up with her dress and makeup.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful mom.&quot; Stephanie complimented her as she gave her a hug. &quot;Aw, thanks sweetie, and before you ask, I&#39;m not nervous, just....excited. It&#39;s the day the two of us have been waiting for, for so long and it&#39;s finally here.&quot; Ann sighed as she looked into the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you want a little hint to how your wife to be looks? I&#39;ve seen her, you know.&quot; Kellie teased her sister with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, we made a promise not to see each other until I go down the aisle.&quot; Ann explained as she now turned to back to Stephanie.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, Steph, Jackie and I did discuss something else too. I&#39;m fine with being called mom while Jackie is fine with you calling her mother just to distinguish who you&#39;re talking to.&quot; Ann explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason and the boys are also getting ready by the way. I love it when our...well, I guess significant others dress up so...dashingly.&quot; Lisa said picturing her husband in his suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I gotta admit. When I saw Jack in his suit, I remembered why I was attracted to him in the first place. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s another man out there for me.&quot; Kellie mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I saw Travis in his suit he&#39;s.....oh.....he&#39;s something.&quot; Stephanie said closing her eyes and let out a loving sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now honey, you aren&#39;t going to feel weird about this, are you? You&#39;ll still be our daughter you know? It&#39;s just your mother and I will be a little older than you now. Of course when you graduate or god forbid we&#39;re called in to the principal&#39;s office because you got into trouble. You can bet Jackie and I are going to look like the older parents.&quot; Ann said to her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, well, okay, maybe. But yeah, whatever age you and mother are, that&#39;s what you&#39;ll always be to me, my moms, and I promise I&#39;ll try not to get into trouble. I&#39;m just so...happy for you....mommy.&quot; Stephanie said as she began to cry tears of joy for her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, baby, don&#39;t cry now. You&#39;ll make me cry and run my makeup.&quot; Ann said patting Stephanie on the back in a hug.<br />
<br />
After a little while, the wedding finally began with the bridesmaids, the groomsmen, and the flower girls coming down the aisle. Everyone was chuckling when Morgan and Lynn threw the petals on the ground and were almost competing with each other for who throws more petals before Kellie and Lisa gave their daughters a quick stern talking to. Jackie walked down the aisle with her father wearing a white wedding suit and veil.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful honey.&quot; Frank said complimenting his daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks daddy.&quot; Jackie thanked her father as they made their way to the altar.<br />
<br />
Now, Jackie waited for Ann, her Angel to proceed down the aisle. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes for the moment so she would be more surprised. Ann had asked Martin to walk her down the aisle of course, but they told people that weren&#39;t aware of Martin and Marilyn&#39;s age situation that he was Ann&#39;s brother. Finally when the music came on for Ann to proceed down the aisle, Jackie slowly opened her eyes to see Ann looking more beautiful than she could have ever imagined. In Jackie&#39;s eyes, she could only look at her bride to be and no one else as Ann wore a sequin silver off-shoulder wedding dress with a crown atop her head with the wedding veil over her face. Jackie could feel her heart beat faster than ever. She remembered the years and romance they spent together, with some hard times between the two, but now here it was, they were surrounded by family and they had an adopted daughter together who couldn&#39;t be more happier for her moms.<br />
<br />
Finally, Ann arrived at the altar and stood across from Jackie with a smile. Both didn&#39;t say anything and waited for the minister to go through the motions of speaking before he asked them if they had any words for each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, from the moment I met you. You&#39;ve been the greatest friend, but you&#39;ve been an amazing partner, and I can&#39;t wait to share the rest of my life with you. You&#39;re part of my world and I promise I&#39;ll carry you myself through all the pain if I have to to make sure your days are perfect in every way. Because I think you&#39;re perfect in every way, my angel.&quot; Jackie said as Ann sighed and Stephanie couldn&#39;t help but smirk at the sentiment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie, I....I didn&#39;t know who I was before I met you. I was so interested on focusing on my own career and thought that I would never in my life meet someone who could open my eyes to a whole new life I never dreamed of. You made me feel like a whole new woman and helped me get my life together with....everything I thought couldn&#39;t be righted. I became a better person because of you. Jackie, my darling Jackie.&quot; Ann said as she smiled at her wife to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you Ann O&#39;Toole take Jackie Kirkman to be your wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, forever.&quot; Ann said holding up her bouqet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you Jackie Kirkman take Ann O&#39;Toole to be your wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, forever and eternity.&quot; Jackie said as Ann blushed bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I now pronounce you Mrs. and Mrs. O&#39;Toole-Kirkman. You may.....&quot; Before the minister could finish, Jackie and Ann jumped into each other&#39;s arms and gave a passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Angel.&quot; Jackie said looking at Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my sweet darling.&quot; Ann said with a smile as Jackie unexpectedly picked Ann up by her feet and carried her down the aisle. Ann sighed as she rested in her wife&#39;s arms and friends and family clapped for both of them<br />
<br />
The reception was an incredible turnout with everyone celebrating. Ann threw her bouquet to a couple of women who were trying to catch it, and it landed right into Stephanie&#39;s hands as she looked over at Travis who smiled. Stephanie then took a whiff of the flowers and her eyes seemed to change as she looked like she was in a trance as she looked over at Travis with a smile and made a motion to emphasize her cleavage on her dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Travis, I caught the bouquet, you know what that means right? It means we should get married right away. I want to have your children.&quot; Stephanie said making Travis a little uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll call them Stephanie jr. or Travis jr. or even Venus.&quot; Stephanie said as Travis now rolled his eyes and looked behind him to see a college age woman standing behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously Venus? You have to play a little joke at my girlfriend&#39;s parents wedding?&quot; Travis sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t blame me little brother. I go where the love is to be found and brother let me tell you, your girlfriends mothers have so much love for each other and your girlfriend I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen before, it goes through the roof. Hell it&#39;s visible from space.&quot; Venus smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, can you maybe change my girlfriend back to normal, please?&quot; Travis asked as Stephanie was applying lipstick to give Travis a large kiss.<br />
<br />
Stephanie&#39;s mind became clear again as she looked around like she forgot the last few minutes. &quot;Travis? What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph, this is my sister, Venus, love goddess.&quot; Travis said quickly introducing the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, nice to meet you. Sorry, I just wanted to tease my baby bro a little bit. Hi, Venus for my public name. Freya for my goddess name. I&#39;m thinking of moving in with Idunn to the Norse realm.&quot; Venus said shaking Stephanie&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;She made you want to...uh....rush into things in our romance. You almost gave me a big kiss with that lipstick you put on you.&quot; Travis said as Stephanie looked at a compact mirror she had to see she put on her best lipstick but now felt a little embarrassed to try and kiss Travis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on over here?&quot; Jackie asked looking at the two of them as she and Ann danced over to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, were you two about to pucker up?&quot; Ann asked with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, mom we just ran into Travis&#39;s relative and....&quot; Stephanie tried to say as Venus gave a little wave to the women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t give excuses honey. Take it from your mothers: savor every kiss you share with your soul mate.&quot; Jackie said as she dipped Ann and gave her a kiss as she let out a playful giggle. Jackie and Ann left their daughter alone as the two teens stood there awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Stephanie, I don&#39;t want to pressure you if it makes you feel awkward. So we can just forget....&quot; Travis began to say before Stephanie gave him a big kiss on the lips leaving some lipstick on his own lips as Stephanie began to chuckle and she showed him his face on her compact mirror as they began to laugh and now Travis asked Stephanie to dance.<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie now came over to Martin and Marilyn who were still in their young forms as to not rouse suspicion from Jackie&#39;s parents or anyone else unfamiliar with magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi daddy, Hello mother.&quot; Ann said nodding towards the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please Ann, just call me &#39;mom&#39; now. No more formal matter with saying &#39;mother&#39;. I&#39;m a different woman now. Both figuritvely and metaphorically. I look....sexy.&quot; Marilyn said turning her face to Martin and flashed her eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mom. Please don&#39;t make me feel gross at my own wedding.&quot; Ann rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s just the youth getting to me dear.&quot; Marilyn said as she grabbed Martin&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I almost forgot! Your father and I have something special for you both. We saved these for Lisa, we saved one for Kellie, which we also gave to her. Now your father and I can give this to you two. It&#39;s for your future.&quot; Marilyn says as she reached into her purse hands the two of them a check.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh mom, you really didn&#39;t...have to....&quot; Ann says as she looks at the number on the check. Jackie looks as well and is surprised as her own jaw drops open at the zeroes before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That comes from years of saving up for three daughters. Now I want you to use that money wisely, use it for your future together and use it for Stephanie and....maybe another grandchild one day.&quot; Marilyn said with a smile as Jackie and Ann both blushed with Marilyn unaware what was waiting her in the future.<br />
<br />
While the O&#39;Toole and Kirkman family were getting along and having a good time. At least some of them, Morgan and Lynne were arguing a little with who was the prettier flower girl with Lisa and Katie sighing as they had to keep their young daughters apart and try and have a good time for Jackie and Ann.<br />
<br />
Adam Haskins was trying to speak with Caleb about Duke and the vampires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Caleb, you and Duke have been best friends for awhile now. You can&#39;t possibly keep this grudge on him.&quot; Adam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam, look I appreciate what you&#39;re trying to do, but it&#39;s complicated. All my experience tells me is Wyatt&#39;s up to something: my brother was injured by a vampire, who works for Duke&#39;s brother and he said he had nothing to do with it. My dad and I knew other vampires before Duke&#39;s brother that tried to play nice but in the end, they were just another couple of cold hard bastards.&quot; Caleb said taking a sip from his cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Caleb, think about the guy&#39;s own family. He&#39;s got kids, right? He doesn&#39;t want to put them in danger, does he?&quot; Adam asked as the mention of Wyatt&#39;s kids made him think of young Andrew and his terrified and bold face again before shaking it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam, look I appreciate what you&#39;re doing, but I don&#39;t want to think about this stuff right now. I want Gloria to be happy for her friend and new aunt.&quot; Caleb said as he looked over to see Ann and Jackie talking happily with Gloria and laughing. Adam sighed as he let Caleb be alone now. &quot;Hey Adam,&quot; Caleb called, the young hunters eyes resting on his drink. &quot;Just tell Duke I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s nothing personal against him.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Jackie and Ann talked with Gloria, they then saw Jackie&#39;s parents taking a few pictures with their camera and she had an idea come to her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad, can you help us get something set up?&quot; Jackie asked her father as they gathered up their relatives around and had someone hold the camera as Jackie and Ann stood in the center of the photo with Jackie&#39;s relatives on one side, Ann&#39;s relatives on the other and they had Stephanie and Travis kneeling in front of them for a family photo. It was a perfect family photo that they would treasure up on their wall for years to come.</p>
