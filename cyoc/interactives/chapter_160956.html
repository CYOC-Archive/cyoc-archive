<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is partially a copy of what Transformatus wrote at /interactives/chapter_147958/branch_147958.html<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ve made some changes to make it fit this line better and to explore more aftermath.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the morning, everyone knew that Elam had been a dick. They didn&#39;t know what happened at the bar or afterward but they all saw Elam sticking out in front of Dakota when he woke up and stumbled into the shower.<br />
<br />
Dakota moaned a lot through the shower, &quot;Sorry Elam, I passed out and don&#39;t know who fucked me. Whoever he was, he was bigger than anyone before. With this hangover, I&#39;m sore at both ends. I&#39;ll get you back to normal after the shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Dakota washed Elam, he finally had the chance to orgasm and splattered the wall of the shower with a lot of cum. The Elam was returned to normal and they came out of the shower.<br />
<br />
Roman walked up immediately and put his hand on Elam&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Well dick, how you feeling now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elam rolled his eyes and said, &quot;Can we just get breakfast. I&#39;m starving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roman ran his hand down Elam&#39;s back all the way to his butt. It reminded him of being stroked like he had been several times last night. &quot;Sure thing dick. Gotta fill your balls so you can get yanked off good, dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got ready and headed out to a sports center that had a small restaurant that specialized in sports food. Their breakfasts had eggs but replaced the bacon and potatoes with other vegetables and fish. Roman kept calling Elam &quot;Dick&quot; and Elam wondered why Ryder hadn&#39;t been teased this much. Yea everyone considered Ryder to be the team dick but he was treated with more respect.<br />
<br />
The Greenville Gremlins happened to be there too at a nearby table. Elam was sure they heard him being called Dick by his teammates. Dallas was the only one being nice but Dallas wasn&#39;t standing up for Elam.<br />
<br />
The Gremlins team captain yelled, &quot;You suck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roman yelled back, &quot;Are you offering to be the dick? We&#39;re going to ride you hard to victory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we have a wager. Losers become dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain had raised an eyebrow and looked Roman up and down. &#39;No need for a bet to know which is which, dick.&#39;<br />
<br />
Kai had laughed and rummaged through his sport&#39;s bag. &quot;I beg to differ. Tada!&quot; he had said, pulling out the dicking device and dicked Ryder. His clothes piled to the seat and Kai pulled Ryder out. He walked to the Gremlins proudly displaying the cock and the Gremlins had wide open eyes.<br />
<br />
Hugo had been pretty explicit, and helpful. &quot;This laser pointer can work like a dicking camera, but it&#39;s really a prototype, it doesn&#39;t have a lot of power. If you want to restore someone after dicking them, you&#39;ll need to wait an hour. So always make sure one of you remains a guy, or else you&#39;ll be stuck as dicks until someone helps you. And try not to make someone stay dicked for more than a week? There could be... side-effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai placed Ryder in the Gremlin captains hands. Ryder felt warm and fleshy and alive.<br />
<br />
One of the Gremlins said, &quot;I heard about this. Someone figured out a way to turn people into dicks. Is it permanent?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kai said, &quot;No but we have to wait an hour before we can restore him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gremlin captain asked, &quot;What&#39;s the bet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin said, &quot;Simple, when someone on either team is eliminated, they&#39;re dicked and become the property of the winner until that teams&#39; next match. The dicked player will get jacked off just before he has to compete. If he loses that match, he gets dicked again until he wins a match.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dallas said, &quot;We need to set some limits. If you win, you can do whatever you want with your new dick except get rid of him or injure him. You need to take care of him. That&#39;s just common decency.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roman added, &quot;Otherwise, anything goes. Dicks are made to be used by men. That&#39;s what you agree to expect if you lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gremlins looked at each other in fear. Roman said, &quot;It&#39;s either all or none. All agree to the wager or there is no wager. I&#39;m in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin and Kai agreed immediately. Roman said, &quot;Ryder is in too. He already knows what it&#39;s like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dallas, Dakota and Elam hesitated but with peer pressure from the others, they finally agreed. Then the peer pressure turned to the Gremlins who began agreeing one by one until everyone was in.<br />
<br />
Roman said, &quot;It&#39;s settled. I will be sucking one of you after the competition. See you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
&quot;And now,&quot; came the voice from the speakers in the gym&#39;s walls, &quot;for the last match of the evening, Roman Lector from the Bastion Bulls versus Andy Weld from the Greenville Gremlins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder had just got dicked again. He put out a good effort. He&#39;d really been energized and the match went into a tie breaker before he finally lost. It was surprising how good Ryder wrestled after being jacked off six times in a row. Roman remembered the mess he made on Austin, Dakota, AND Dallas.<br />
<br />
Todd, the gremlin who had already heard about dicking, managed to break his legs just before the competition. He showed up in a cast and on crutches. He was a large, beefcake of a dude.<br />
<br />
Kai said, &quot;That counts as a forfeit.&quot; and pointed the laser pointer at Todd. When he tried to fish Todd out of his clothes, he found that Todd had fallen so deep into his cast that he was now stuck and out of reach. That Todd bastard was packing a monster cock. Ryder looked inadequate in comparison, despite being nine inches long and seven thick.<br />
<br />
Austin, Dakota and Dallas were disappointments in most meanings of the term. They&#39;d lost both their matches and their right to remain human. In defeat though, they at least presented themselves as one long, thin white cock, one latino cock and one fat seven incher. Better than nothing. It would only motivate his opponents for the next match.<br />
<br />
Elam had won, barely, and earned himself a chubby little dick for his troubles.<br />
<br />
Andy Weld stepped into the ring in a tight red and white bodysuit that clung to his abs and his groin. Roman could make out the shape of his future cock right here and there. He had chosen well, saving the piece of resistance for last.<br />
<br />
The bell rang, and Roman threw himself into the fight. He left no time for Andy to fight back and tackled him to the ground. The move clearly stunned Andy, and Roman pressed his advantage. He twisted one arm and pinned him in place with both knees. In desperation, Andy bucked and managed to hit Roman in the crotch.<br />
<br />
Roman grinned wildly. Nothing there today! &quot;Eager, huh?&quot; he growled into his opponent&#39;s ears. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I kept it safe and smooth for you. You&#39;ll love it down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
His opponents&#39; bravado faltered. The smirk turned into a grimace, the movement of his wrists grew frantic. He was struggling, bucking, trashing, but the referee began the inevitable countdown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten... Nine...&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy desperately attempted to push Roman off him, snapping. &quot;I won&#39;t let you get away with what you did to Todd and Vince!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! You&#39;re going to join them. I&#39;m going to dick you. You&#39;re going to become my big. Fat. COCK!&#39; he punctuated that last word with a powerful slam that made Andy&#39;s eyes unfocus. His muscles went slack.<br />
<br />
The bell rang three times. He&#39;d won.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Andy muttered, and how right that was.<br />
<br />
The laser pointer worked its magic immediately, and the uniform collapsed under Roman. He hit his knees on the ring, grinning as he went fishing for the nice big dick he&#39;d been eying all night. Nine inches, hairy and straight as an arrow. But better than everything, his and his alone. No sharing his cock with other teammates!<br />
<br />
Roman wasted no time waiting for the sake of a mere medal or congratulations. He had a much better trophy with him. Roman ran to the lockerroom and frantically shoved his dicked opponent into his pants. Fuck subtlety. Tingling ran through his crotch as he felt the attachment work its magic, and his new dick lock itself where he had been smooth and dickless a moment before.<br />
<br />
&quot;HA! How do you feel now, dickhead? Good, I bet!&quot; he danced letting his dick swing with the momentum. Andy was longer than Roman. He should have been jealous, but how could one be jealous when the object of your jealousy was a powerless prick stuck between your legs.<br />
<br />
Kai and Elam, the only other human members of his team left, drooled. They were holding their opponents by the balls, likely teasing before getting to the main meal. Roman didn&#39;t have the patience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, guys, time to start educating those dicks about their place in the real world.&quot;</p>
