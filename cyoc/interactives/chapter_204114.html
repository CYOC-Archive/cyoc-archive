<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Moon for his contribution</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trog and Xarxos stared at the car containing Sebastian and Julius as it peeled off down the road. Kornelius dismissed himself and left, opening the front door into a twisted inferno filled with screams and cackles and closed it behind him. Trog double-checked their door no longer opened into the fiery pits of hell.<br />
<br />
“Do you have an idea for fighting them?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“No….” Trog paused. “But maybe I don’t need one.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t follow.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“It’s just something that’s been bothering me. Rusty getting taken out was kind of a foregone conclusion. But why would RK fall for such an obvious trap? He’d never take that risk.” Trog said. “Unless…”<br />
<br />
“You’re saying he pulled a Doctor Weird?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Right.”<br />
<br />
“Doctor…Weird?” Xarxos asked.<br />
<br />
“He foresaw the only way to win was for him to lose.” Todd shrugged. “Thanatos Gambit.”<br />
<br />
“But he said his Precognition was being blocked.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Sure. When he started investigating the possibility of splitting the Books and going after Myth first.” Trog nodded. “But he still knew everything about that fight. The layout of his mansion, the Bad Ends.”<br />
<br />
“And?” Xarxos snorted. “He’s a sex slave. He isn’t going to tell us much.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but if you have multiple timelines with important pieces of information shared through all of them, you’d write them down, right? Record them somehow?” Trog prodded.<br />
<br />
“Say you’re right.” Xarxos frowned. “Where would he put this notebook?”<br />
<br />
“In the most obvious place in the world!” Trog stood up, ignoring the discomfort his bad knees gave him, and ran to the spare guest room he’d stored Rusty and RK’s luggage in.<br />
<br />
Trog sifted through the belongings of his friends. Neither of them had much-two bags each. Trog took his time to carefully sort through both of them. <br />
<br />
Rusty had managed to smuggle his revolver onto the plane. Trog strapped the holster on, made sure he could draw it. He wasn’t well-trained when it came to firearms but he knew the basics. Xarxos would stop him, wanting a bloodless battle, but Trog thought that was rather foolish of him.<br />
<br />
RK’s things were mostly clothes, some cologne, socks, shoes. And a CD with WATCH ME written on it in permanent marker. Trog sighed. There it was.<br />
<br />
Todd, Xarxos and Trog sat around the TV. Xarxos finished setting up the video player and turned it on. Then he entered the CD and hit play.<br />
<br />
RK’s face appeared  on screen. The skunk was filming in a bathroom.<br />
<br />
“If you’re watching this, I’m already dead. Or something else equally terrible.” RK began. “I’d like to say: Don’t worry! It was exactly as I planned all along! Or some bullshit like that. Sorry, that’s not how it goes.”<br />
<br />
“Great.” Todd snorted, small flames flickering from his nostrils.<br />
<br />
“I let myself get taken out because he wouldn’t have approached you otherwise. Divination is too dangerous. Rusty will be taken out in a similar way as myself, I think. Todd is obviously dead.”<br />
<br />
”Wrong!” Todd pouted. “Why would he even think that?”<br />
<br />
Trog shifted uncomfortably in his chair. Xarxos cleared his throat. <br />
<br />
Todd eyed them both.<br />
<br />
“Really? Fuck you guys!” Todd crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure Tex has somehow emasculated Troy with his overbearing and self-righteous sense of morality.” RK smirked. “That guy can’t just let things go.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t emasculate you.” Xarxos mumbled.<br />
<br />
“You did!” Trog groaned. “Literally! My penis no longer works thanks to you!”<br />
<br />
“For now!” Xarxos grumbled. “Geez! Take away a guy’s cock for just one day…”<br />
<br />
“I predict that you will be done arguing by now.” RK smiled. “This video is being recorded at the gas station bathroom we stopped at before we got to Studio Village. I have, like, five minutes tops before Asterion gets suspicious. So shut up and listen.”<br />
<br />
“Rude.” Trog said.<br />
<br />
“I saw the mansion through other timelines. Sebastian is consistent. He has two mansions-one filled with deadly traps and the other a regular house. The little cove below the seaside cliff his property is on is home to a Kraken. The Western entrance leads directly to a topiary garden inside a hedge maze filled with Minotaurs led by a Medusa. His reflecting pool can dump you in any body of water on earth. His lawn has traps. The only safe routes are the ones the guards use which means using the front entrance, which is obviously well-guarded. Speaking of which, all the guards are paramilitary trained. Disarming them won’t stop them from fist fighting you. You need to take some of them out to gain the bracelets needed access the real mansion.” RK paused and looked at something at the top of the screen. “My fucking batteries are about to die. Alright, most importantly, Sebastian isn’t-”<br />
<br />
The video ended.<br />
<br />
Trog stared nonplussed at the screen. “Isn’t what?”<br />
<br />
“Isn’t finishing his message.” Todd shrugged. “We need to rescue Sophia. Sebastian is psychotic.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos nodded. “Mark is a much better Book owner. He tries to make people happy.”<br />
<br />
Trog sighed. “I mean, Mark wasn’t great either. I wonder if wanting to turn people into dumb fuuuh…freakbeasts is a common Elf fetish. RK had the same thing done to him by that other elf.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos shifted uneasily. “He um, he tried to do it to me as well.”<br />
<br />
“And you are overbearing as well.” Trog frowned. “Curing me by making me boring.”<br />
<br />
“It’s what was needed.” Xarxos snorted. “I will not be lectured by a mere forty-five year old on morality, when I, who have lived a thousand, know what is best.”<br />
<br />
“You’re 18.” Todd said. “You only think you’re a thousand years old. And if I recall, you went on a big diatribe about why you shouldn’t force changes on people without their permission. You didn’t even ask him. Look at him, you altered his whole personality!”<br />
<br />
“Here’s what I don’t get, Xarxos.” Trog spoke softly. “How do I always end up on the sh...shooty end of all these changes? I’m arthritic with a limp penis. You are a hunky immortal demigod. How did that happen?”<br />
<br />
“I told you, you’ll get better if you just let the changes in.”<br />
<br />
“The changes just seem to make him fatter and older, actually. And too polite to complain about it. Complacent.” Todd pointed out. “You seem to want him to accept being old, not get him back into shape.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos sniffed. “He’s smarter this way.”<br />
<br />
“Wow.” Trog shook his head. “I can’t believe I married someone so pompous.”<br />
<br />
“You weren’t married when I saw you last.” Todd said.<br />
<br />
“Can we concentrate on the task at hand?” Xarxos snarled. “I have promised to fix you once the Paradox is gone. Must you harangue me for my choices all day?”<br />
<br />
“I forgive you for attempting to fix the situation...in your own way.” Trog said. “But you broke my trust when you did it without my permission.”<br />
<br />
“Will you accept it now? Be boring so we can get through this alive?” Xarxos asked.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t beat Transmutation by coloring within the lines.” Trog reminded him.<br />
<br />
“No, you just destroyed half the city and endangered everyone in the neighborhood to do so.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, so I’m not allowed to turn a car into a tank and blow up the mansion at a safe distance?” Trog replied cooly. “Perhaps transform a drone into a cruise missile and blow up his property?”<br />
<br />
“Sophia is there!” Todd gasped as Xarxos opened his mouth to reply.<br />
<br />
“Who the fu-fuuu…furk is Sophia and why do we even trust her?” Trog snapped.<br />
<br />
“She is Sebastian’s sister.” Xarxos explained.<br />
<br />
“And? Would she want us killing him? Who says she doesn’t have her own agenda?” Trog blinked. “Holy shhhhhoot, she’s the chick from the dream I had! That’s where I remember her from!”<br />
<br />
“She wants to be saved.” Todd said. “She wanted to be free. Her brother placed all kinds of nasty enchantments on her. There’s a chastity aura that turns all lustful men who dare touch her into something incapable of doing so. She’s single, obviously.”<br />
<br />
“Obviously.” Trog replied drolly. “So what? I know how to use Transmutation fully. I’ve seen it in action. Xarxos?”<br />
<br />
“Show up at the gate and challenge him.” Xarxos shrugged.<br />
<br />
“And die.” Todd and Trog said at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Being a thousand years old made you kinda dumb, huh?” Todd said.<br />
<br />
“Todd, stop with the insults.” Trog shot him a disapproving look.<br />
<br />
Xarxos stood and towered over Todd. “I said that what HE should do. WE, my rude friend, are infiltrating the mansion and rescuing this Sophia. Got a problem with that!?”<br />
<br />
“I do.” Trog said. “It’s entirely in his favor. He can mimic any spell he wants with the proper summon. He can also just snipe me with a pair of binoculars from his house. We need to reduce visibility so that he doesn’t simply do that.”<br />
<br />
“You could cut the power. He’d have backup generators, though.” Todd scratched his chin with a claw.<br />
<br />
“How long would it take for them to kick in?” Xarxos asked<br />
<br />
“Two minutes if it’s manual, instantly if they cut on when the power cuts off.” Todd said. “That’s how the hospital I worked at part-time did it.”<br />
<br />
Trog snapped his fingers. “I got it! EMP.”<br />
<br />
“All known EMPs are caused by explosives.” Xarxos said. “Gods above, I just realized you could literally create a nuke with that Book.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a great way to die horribly if the Auditor is paying any attention at all. And he is.” Trog shrugged. “Also, great way to accidentally start a nuclear war that ends all life on earth.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s the problem with fighting this guy.” Todd sighed. “We have to fight with our hands behind our backs. Meanwhile, he can just cheat. What if he summons, like, literally Jesus?”<br />
<br />
“Can he?” Trog asked, intrigued.<br />
<br />
“Divine Summoning. Probably get hit with Paradox, but a great way to end the world.” Xarxos said. “I don’t think he’ll summon a literal god.”<br />
<br />
“Look, the more we talk and plan, the more he can talk and plan.” Todd interrupted. “I say screw waiting for nightfall. We do it in broad daylight. He’s got Paradox to deal with, any crazy shit he summons is going to be seen by people on the beach.”<br />
<br />
“Would it, though?” Trog asked, “I mean, I am intrigued by your idea, but he’s changed LA into Myth City. Hold on, let me check and see what time most robberies take place.”<br />
<br />
Trog pulled out his phone and squinted, digging into his breast pocket he retrieved his reading glasses. “Okay. Um…” He realized he had no idea how it worked.<br />
<br />
“I am really sorry.” Todd said, taking Trog’s phone and tapping his fingers rapidly. “Xarxos did a number on you. “<br />
<br />
“Phones are a plague on civilization.” Xarxos jerked his chin up. “He can occupy himself with something more productive.”<br />
<br />
“Cock.” Todd muttered and then spoke up. “Alright! Most robberies take place during the day. Less security and it offers the robber better visibility, especially if the location is not well-known to them.”<br />
<br />
“What about the human security?”<br />
<br />
“I mean. Are we really concerned with human security?” Todd shrugged. “Xarxos can just turn them into pregnant women or ambulatory penises.”<br />
<br />
“I will not.” Xarxos stuck out his chin. “It’s wrong,”<br />
<br />
Trog clenched his fists. “Fine. Figure out a way to get rid of them. I won’t help you if you get caught,, because frankly, I’m tired of you and your holier-than-thou attitude.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos actually looked hurt. “But, Trog…”<br />
<br />
“This is a fight between wizards. If you can’t handle that, give up your Book. Personally, I’m turning them all into d-dildos.” Trog blushed. “Or something.”<br />
<br />
“That’s evil!”<br />
<br />
“That’s life babe, and I’m tired of pretending I should value their lives over yours.” Trog snarled. “I’ll walk up to that gate, in broad daylight, and issue my challenge. It may be the dumbest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But I’m doing it for you.”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Xarxos glanced down. “But I can’t hurt people like that.”<br />
<br />
Trog frowned, placing his hand on Xarxos’. “They want to hurt us, babe.”<br />
<br />
“I know, but…” Xarxos shook his head. “I can’t.”<br />
<br />
Trog sat in silence, staring at Xarxos. “Can you make them feel better like you made me better?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Xarxos asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, obviously they are bad, mean people working for a bad dude. Go ahead and make them better people. Improve them.” Trog smirked. “Put that self-righteousness to work. Make ‘em intellectuals, like you’ve been trying to do to me.”<br />
<br />
“It’s mostly worked, just taking a while to fully stick.” Todd whispered.<br />
<br />
“Do be quiet.” Trog said.<br />
<br />
“See? You would have told me to fuck off.” Todd smirked.<br />
<br />
“Language!” Trog scolded and turned his attention to Xarxos. “Anyways, are you in?”<br />
<br />
Xarxos slowly nodded. &quot;I will put them all to sleep instead. Mass Sleep. I&#39;ve been afraid of using it because they might fall into a permanent sleep, like in the fairytales, but I believe I can control it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, man!&quot; Todd smiled.<br />
<br />
Trog stood up and hugged his husband. They kissed briefly. Xarxos smiled down at his old bugbear lover.<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Trog sniffed, blinking away a tear, adjusting his wire-rimmed glasses. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for arguing with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
“I love you too.” Xarxos smiled, watching Trog’s hairline as it added a few more gray hairs and receded an inch, his waistline expanding slightly. “And I don’t think you’re boring.”<br />
<br />
-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Trog walked slowly up to the gate of Sebastian’s sprawling mansion, knees aching. It was set at the bottom of the hill the mansion sat on, completely out of view of the mansion itself for security purposes. Trog had to hand it to the guy, he knew how to defend himself. Even the landscaping was expertly tailored for maximum privacy, blocking view of most of the yard itself.<br />
<br />
It was hard on his back as well and the mid-afternoon sun had him sweating something terrible. He wished he could be sprawled on Chef Tanaka’s massage table having every ache expertly rubbed and tugged out of him, but here he was. Behind him, a drone whirred between trees, one of Trog’s creations. Xarxos and Todd were moving towards the hedge maze entrance. Xarxos was monitoring the front gate on a tablet while Todd operated the drone.<br />
<br />
Any other day, and the jog would actually be pleasant. Birds were chirping, there was a nice breeze off the coast, the trees lining the road cast a lot of shade. But the guards, packing some kind of compact sub-machine gun, put a damper on that. There had to be at least ten of them, two in the guard shack next to the gate and ten more patrolling the area. They wore identical Polos and khakis with sunglasses and hats.<br />
<br />
And they were all passed out, asleep at their posts or lying along their patrol routes. Trog grinned, wiping sweat from a forehead that was larger than he remembered. He paused. Did he always have a receding hairline? He needed to hurry and get that Book, Xarxos was taking the maturity thing a bit too far for his liking.<br />
<br />
Trog gathered up some bracelets and three earpieces, checking the gate house for anything amiss and noticed a paper tacked on the wall. It was his photograph. Thank goodness Xarxos had knocked out the guards or he’d be one very dead old bugbear!<br />
<br />
Trog packaged the bracelets and and earpieces and a set of keys in a plastic bag and motioned the drone over. He attached the bag and waved it off. The drone whirred away, moving towards the gardens. The Trog got dressed in an ill-fitting uniform and used Object to alter it into a more professional fit. The computer was opened, so he went in and tried altering employee files with Object instead of actually inputting it. Somehow, Xarxos had managed to make him computer and phone-illiterate, so magic was basically the only thing he could do. <br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, Trog, a 53 year old bugbear, appeared to be an official security guard. He smirked at his work, perfect cover, though something was off with the age. Trog double-checked that a cover was ALL it was-he had no intention of accidentally signing yet another contract. A few minutes of searching and it seemed fine. The guards would be unconscious for at least an hour and a half while their minds went though a deep REM sleep. After that, it was a simple matter of scrambling any alerts with his face on it. He found that task much easier, of course, as files could naturally corrupt with one bad piece of code. In fact…<br />
<br />
“Object” Trog pointed.<br />
<br />
The screen flickered and then shut off. Computer virus. Trog didn’t know how they actually worked, but he had imagined malevolent code eating every bit of data and then transferring to any device it was connected to. In a few minutes, every system on the island would be down. Thankfully not the ear pieces as they were on a separate system.<br />
<br />
Patting his new submachine gun, he took a longer look around and found a golf cart. It looked like it was meant to shuttle guards form the gatehouse to the mansion. Trog paused and Mass Objected all the submachine guns into highly detailed but non-functional replicas. Even his own gun got hit, but he could always just use Object and return it into a fully functional one should the need arise.<br />
<br />
He tapped his earpiece three times and drove up the hill to the mansion. That was the signal for the others to start their break-in. The hedge maze was super dangerous and he hoped Xarxos wouldn’t get stuck as a statue. <br />
<br />
“Gate 1 come in.” A voice crackled in Trog’s ear.<br />
<br />
He reached up and tapped the earpiece. “Copy.”<br />
<br />
“Send Trog up here. He needs to sign some paperwork. Someone forgot to do their job, apparently.” The voice was female and annoyed.<br />
<br />
“He’s on his way.” Trog grinned.<br />
<br />
“Make sure he has two forms of ID, please.”<br />
<br />
“Will do.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” The voice cut out.<br />
<br />
So it had worked! Trog smirked. Better, he now had an excuse to come up to the office, which was right by the mansion itself. This was easy. Maybe too easy…<br />
<br />
As long as this was just luck, he’d be fine. <br />
<br />
If not, he was about to have a very bad day.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Xarxos and Todd had run into a problem. Gorgons-the snake women with gazes that turned anyone who looked at them to stone-were not susceptible to Sleep. The Minotaurs were easier, but even they had a surprising resistance to spells.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes ago, Trog had finally sent the signal. Todd blamed Xarxos for making Trog all but useless when it came to technology. They had an hour before the guards woke up. They had their bracelets and ear pieces and were surprised when Trog was called into the office.<br />
<br />
“He better not sign those papers.” Todd growled.<br />
<br />
“He’s older, not stupid.” Xarxos shrugged. “Let’s concentrate on dealing with this Gorgon.”<br />
<br />
The Gorgon was fast. She’d also felt the Sleep spell attempt on her and was now actively seeking the one who cast it. The drone was high overhead, hovering and sending a video feed of her and the maze. Unfortunately, running the maze and the drone while avoiding the Gorgon was becoming more than a little hard to manage.<br />
<br />
“Listen, Todd.” Xarxos hissed. “The way this maze is designed is NOT typical. You cannot just use your hand and follow the hedge and hope it leads you to an exit. It’s Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Left, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right and finally Left. Got that?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Just, you know what, give me your arm and I’ll write-!” Xarxis pulled out a marker and just as he pressed it to Todd’s scales, a bush rustled.<br />
<br />
They froze. Around a corner, something hissed. Todd checked the drone footage, eyes wide. He pointed silently at the Gorgon on the other side of the hedge.<br />
<br />
*Move!* Xarxos mouthed and shoved him down the left hand path.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Todd ran. Behind him, he heard Xarxos shout something and an enraged hiss. Touching his earpiece, Todd gave it the quadruple beep. Trouble in the hedge maze. Then he tripped on a root and his phone flew out of his hand and smashed on the bricks, screen cracked and useless.<br />
<br />
“Shit!’ Todd cursed under his breath.<br />
<br />
Without the video feed, he couldn’t just keep his gaze fixed on the screen. He’d actually need to look around and risk getting petrified. Todd stumbled through the maze blindly, his hand covering his eyes to avoid accidentally looking at the Medusa. He hoped the Minotaur was OK.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably doing better than I am...Minotaurs and mazes.&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued forward, one hand held onto his faux book just in case something popped out. If he was going down, it wouldn&#39;t be without a fight. The fullness of the buttplug gave him comfort, knowing it would give him a fighting chance.<br />
<br />
Todd came across a dead end and turned to backtrack. He heard shuffling nearby and stopped, listening carefully. When he felt he was in the clear he continued, this time using his fire breath to carefully singe a spot in the ground to mark the dead end.<br />
<br />
And so he continued, running into dead end after dead end. He quickly realized that he was lost, and while the markings were helping, he wasn&#39;t moving quickly enough. He needed to hurry if he had any chance at arriving where he needed to be on time.<br />
<br />
Left, Right, Dead End. Right, Right, Left, Dead End. FUCK.<br />
<br />
He moved faster, risking small peeks through his fingers. The Minotaur had told him the directions, but who could possibly remember all of that?<br />
<br />
Left, Right, Right, Left, Dead End. Right. Right, Left...SMASH.<br />
<br />
The dragonborn spluttered as he crashed into a tiered stone fountain he hadn&#39;t seen. His thick form had broken the basin and water spilled out, drenching his clothes and the book. He heard the bushes nearby move and froze again. That had made a lot of noise! He turned and began to sprint but started to slow as he felt a tingle on his body, emanating from his wet clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Shit. Shit.&quot; He realized he must&#39;ve sprung a trap and hurriedly tore off the offending clothing, hoping to mitigate whatever he&#39;d done. Naked was better than dead. He continued forward.<br />
<br />
Left, Left, Right, Dead End.<br />
<br />
The tingling resumed, this time consuming his leg in pins and needles.<br />
<br />
Todd began to panic as the sensation spread throughout his body. What was happening? He looked down and didn&#39;t see any changes yet, and his heart thudded in his chest. Soon, the tingling began to withdraw, and Todd realized it was moving towards his ass, as though the buttplug were drawing it in as it began to vibrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Alexandros! You beautiful sick bastard,&quot; Todd grinned as he tried to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
The tingling returned, this time coming outward from the plug, and the Dragonborn realized he&#39;d celebrated too soon. He reached behind him to feel under his tail as fur pushed through the cracks in his scales. The numbness spread to his thick dragon tail and he felt it begin to shrink and withdraw into his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no no. Fuck. FUCK!&quot; Todd craned his neck to see what was happening as the brown fur quickly spread down his legs, replacing the scales. As the changes moved onto his torso, the scales simply flaked away leaving beautiful olive tanned skin in their wake.<br />
<br />
Todd tried to steady his breathing as he felt himself begin to shrink from his tall, dragonborn frame. His taloned feet shifted with a dull crack as the claws thickened and quickly overtook his toes before settling into lithe hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Fucking Alexandros. A satyr? Really?&quot; Todd rolled his eyes. A satyr was better than a hippogriff or a jackalope.<br />
<br />
The changes hit his groin, as his dick was pushed out of its protective slit, quickly followed by thick, heavy looking balls. A strong and earthy musk hit his nostrils as testosterone and lust tainted his bloodstream. &quot;So this is why he was so insistent...&quot; Todd grinned as he watched his dick plump from its streamlined draconian shape to something truly obscene and massive.<br />
<br />
His scales gave way to skin as the changes continued past his chest, leaving thick, pinchable nipples on meaty pecs. He couldn&#39;t help but admire the new shape as the claws on his fingers withdrew as he dragged a finger across his sensitive skin. He felt his tail finish changing into a furry puff, positioned as though to highlight the cleft of his furry ass.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s snout withdrew as his head reshaped into something much more human, thick curly hair brushing away the remaining scales, and thick pouty lips covering his blunted teeth as a wild beard grew on his chin. The horns on his head shifted from their angled points to curl around the side of his head, like the horns of a ram.<br />
<br />
The new satyr exhaled deeply as he groped himself lewdly. These new urges would take some getting used to! He paused and looked around carefully, remembering what he was doing. His tufty ears shifted, listening carefully.<br />
<br />
Nothing. He was still in the clear.<br />
<br />
But the changes weren&#39;t done with him yet.<br />
<br />
Todd continued to lose height as his chest and stomach ballooned out as he gained a prominent but sexy beer belly. He looked like he&#39;d spent a lifetime lounging, eating, drinking, and fucking. Finally, as he approached 5&#39;4&quot;, he seemed to stop changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not ideal but I&#39;m sure Xarxos can help fix this,&quot; Todd laughed as he ran a hairy hand across his belly. &quot;Back to business.&quot; He put his hand over his eyes once more and continued forward once again.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after that he realized he really had to piss. Sure, it was a hot day and he&#39;d had some water on the way to the mansion, but this seemed excessive. He figured he could hold it as he continued forward. Left, Left, Right...No, this was getting bad. He kept going until he couldn&#39;t hold it any longer. At least he was outside, in a garden, that he didn&#39;t own. Not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Todd positioned himself with his back to a corner to prevent someone from sneaking up on him and kept his gaze down. He aimed his thick cock at a nearby rosebush and began to unload as a clear stream shot forth.<br />
<br />
Relief hit him instantly as he felt the flow exit through his shaft. He really was sensitive--no wonder Satyrs were so hedonistic! He sighed deeply into the release. He breathed again. The flow continued, and his bladder felt just as full as it had when he&#39;d started.<br />
<br />
Wait, something was wrong. He strained, trying to push harder on his bladder, and the stream continued, longer than it should have. Admittedly, he didn&#39;t know much about Satyrs, but this seemed excessive. He tried to calm himself as he continued well beyond a minute, and he began to panic.<br />
<br />
What was wrong? Why couldn&#39;t he stop? Why did his bladder still feel unbearably full? And why did it feel so good?<br />
<br />
A nearby shift in the grass startled him and he glanced up reflexively. And there she stood in all her serpentine glory, hair hissing in his direction. Todd&#39;s heart sank as he stared into Medusa&#39;s piercing eyes.<br />
<br />
The effect was immediate as white marble engulfed his hooves, locking them into place. It shot up his legs and into his arms, one holding his massive cock, another carefully balancing the leather book. Stone marble quickly overtook his chest and body and Todd cried out in shock as his face froze in place, mouth open as though caught in a naughty act.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, the stone swirled around his dick, petrifying it as the clear stream continued unabated onto the flowers below.<br />
<br />
Medusa grinned evilly and snatched the book from his hand and quickly disappeared into the maze once more as Todd was left to consider his fate. He couldn&#39;t move at all, but he could still feel everything. He struggled and could only wonder where he&#39;d gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Why hadn’t the buttplug saved him? He could still feel it, albeit rock-hard and fused inside of his asshole. Just as he could still feel the endless need to urinate despite his petrification.<br />
<br />
And then it hit him. The magic had worked, as he still had his mind and his wits about him. His stony heart sank. Things had backfired spectacularly. He was doomed to experience the life of a statue--a magically peeing fountain no less--with no way to communicate and he didn&#39;t look anything like he did when he&#39;d entered the maze. And his bladder was still so full. And it felt so fucking good to pee.<br />
<br />
Todd tried counting the seconds at first, but minutes turned into an hour and the hot sun shifted in the sky. The satyr fountain could do nothing but wait and water the roses, his bladder never emptying, enjoying the pleasurable sensation of relief constantly washing through him. Todd hoped his friends would be able to find him, if they even recognized him, in this secluded part of the maze.<br />
<br />
When a huge snake tail coiled around him and gently lifted him up, carrying him back to the tiered fountain and set him on top, Todd couldn’t even protest. He simply filled the newly repaired fountain endlessly. <br />
<br />
As she settled him carefully, adjusting him to make sure he was centered properly, Todd couldn’t but think that even with the snakes she had a really nice jawline. And those cheekbones were to die for! Maybe, with a little TLC and some foundation, she’d be getting guys hard in a different way.<br />
<br />
The Medusa paused, eyed him oddly, as though it sensed his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Where isss real Book?” She hissed, eyes narrowing.<br />
<br />
With Xarxos, of course, Todd thought.<br />
<br />
“Where isss Xarxosss?”<br />
<br />
No idea.<br />
<br />
“I have power over the stone I make! Do you wisssh to pisss for all eternity or, perhaps, something more tolerable, hmmm?”<br />
<br />
Todd struggled not to think about how good cumming would feel.<br />
<br />
“I do not know how you kept your mind, but if you tell me what I wish to know, you will enjoy your new form. Who elssse is here? What isss your plan?”<br />
<br />
Inwardly, Todd whimpered. He could tell she wouldn’t stop questioning him. Eventually, he’d slip up, his mind would wander to the truth and the Medusa would know everything.<br />
<br />
“Not ssslipping, being good. You will be rewarded for it.” The Medusa smiled, sharp fangs glinting.<br />
<br />
Todd hoped someone would find him fast.</p>
