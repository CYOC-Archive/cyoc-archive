<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott quickly downed the vial in one quick gulp and smiled at me, my cock reacting right away and twitching at his toothy grin.  I took note of the time then quickly looked back at the naked god standing in front of me.  His toned body was covered in dark, brown, hair that only complemented his tanned skin.  His limp dick, 7 inches and pretty wide in comparison to my own.  Obviously the fairly cool air-conditioned climate was not affecting him.  I looked up to meet his brown eyes and turned away, embarrassed that I had been caught staring.  He chuckled and shook his head, his short black hair standing stiff but without the aid of gel or mousse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it's ok.  I'm used to people doing that.&quot;  Scott smiled again and was about to continue when suddenly his stomach grumbled loudly.  We both looked at it.  Scott then let off a huemungous belch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;.  His wash board abs shook a little and then a reaction started.  Scott looked up at me<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh doc?&quot;  He was too busy looking at me to se what happened next.<br />
  <br />
His abs slowly lost their definition as his stomach swelled and gurgled.  If my cock wasn't erect then, it was damn sure leaking now!  It looked as if someone had attached an airhose to his stomach and turned it on.  Though it lasted only a few seconds, the effect was obvious, to me at least.  Gone were the defined ridges and it their place a slightly bloated belly.  It looked like he had gained a few pounds, his gut slightly pudgy looking and curving out a bit.  I could have sworn he developed some love handles too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot;  I pointed to his gut and he looked back up at me as if I were crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  He shifted a bit and it looked as if his gut shrunk back a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your stomach!  It just blew up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, it usually does that,&quot; Scott stifled a burp &quot;when I drink beer.  But it's never happened this late and my gut's never grumbled this much before. *BUUUUURRRRRP* - sorry.  Man is that stuff I drank supposed to give me this much gas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um no, it shouldn't I don't think.&quot;  I quickly reviewed the side effects in my head, coming to the conclusion that none of this was supposed to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, maybe it was the mexican I had as a snack then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You ate!&quot;  He was shocked into a stunned silence, the only noisein the lab was his stomach quietly rumbling and churning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah.  I thought you got that when I told you about my usual beer experiences-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ate AND drank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were just talking about it in the figurative sense!  Not that you had actually just gone and...wait, just hold up now.  I could be over reacting.  How long ago did you eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
He placed his hand on his chin and thought while he looked at the clock.  Great, I should have figured that anyone willing to participate would have to be an idiot.  Even good looking slightly tubby ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since it's 6:52 now, i finished about 37 minutes ago and, if you want to be picky about it, 24 seconds.&quot;  Maybe not so dumb after- wait...<br />
<br />
&quot;You ate and then took the formula?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU... argh!  The idea of me asking you to come at this time was to avoid any contact with food!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Not everyone here eats at the same time you do!  I like to enjoy a meal!&quot;  Scott crossed his arms over his larger gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;ENJOY?!&quot;  Just count to ten... &quot;Ok then, obviously there was a miscommunication somewhere.  How much of what have you eaten exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since I had to get here I cut it short.  I just went *belch* to the mexican place down the road from here and ordered a smaller amount than my usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was about to blow my top at his lack of admittance when I realised his pause was to let what I thought would be, a burp escape.  Instead I was rewarded with something like a fog horn, strong enough to blow my hair around.  It was the kind of thing you only see on kid's morning cartoons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.  Anyway, all I had was a full pitcher of beer and an extra large helping of double beef nachos with a serving of beans on the side.  <br />
<br />
My mouth dropped open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, two servings of beans, two more glasses of beer and I shared some of my bud's serving aswell.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for a minute there I thought you ate that all on your own.&quot;  I siged in relief.  That many calories on a constant basis would surely give a guy a heart attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, that was what I ate on my own.  My bud, Pat, just had a burrito and like I said I ate half of that.  I know, it seems like a lot but I'm a big guy and I need the fuel to feed these puppies.&quot;  He flexed and I stood there, once again mouth open from shock.<br />
<br />
Sensing my lack of approval, Scott scratched the back of his neck, and this time I was rewarded with a fart.  &quot;Heh, better out than in, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in response his stomach grumbled and this time we both watched the transformation.  Scott's thighs grew bigger and rounder, adding bulk that was undefined and could easily be confused as fat.  If he had been wearing his pants, the slow but continual fattening would have his pants splitting at the seams.  His butt inflated like a pair of basket balls, growing bigger and bigger but never sagging.  Further up his shoulders seemed to grow broader, though unlike his thighs, seemed to be more muscular.  The same happening to his pecs, definitely more meaty but not breast-like.  His stomach became more pudgy and softer, surprisingly growing very little.  His biceps bulged with muscle as if to keep in league with Scott's pecs.  Finally, after a few minutes of slow fattening/growing, it stopped.<br />
<br />
I looked up to Scott, pleased to find that his face remained unchanged.  This of course, led me to look down to his balls.  They too had grown to keep in proportion of his bloated body.<br />
<br />
Another rip snorting fart brought my attention back to Scott.  He stood there stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean this when I said huge!&quot;  I have really got to make a better screening process<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that.  The only reason this is happening is because you ate before drinking the formula!&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott looked at me and bit his lip.  Damn my weakness for hotties!<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, put simply, the compound was meant to react with you- your body tissue, which would result in muscle growth.  What’s happened was that it was absorbed by your food instead.  The reaction took place with your food while you were digesting it, turning you into a blimp instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott's brow creased and he turned away.  Damn my mouth!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sorry about that but I'm just worried and a little stressed.&quot;  I put my hand on his shoulder and turned him to face me, getting a belch right in my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I deserved that&quot;  I tried to joke with him &quot;Listen, you said you were with a friend, is he waiting around for you?&quot;  Scott shook his head.  It was now that I realised that he had grown at least two inches, and stood over me even more so than before.  &quot;Good.  I think it best that we keep you here until we can figure out what happened exactly and if it will continue.&quot;  His stomach grumbled loudly<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we can reverse it?&quot;  Scott asked me hopefully<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we can reverse it.&quot;  I smiled at him.  Slowly Scott moved closer to me, his considerably bigger and erect dick pressing into my belly.  I found mine responding also.  He slowly leaned into kiss me, when his flatulence quickly freed me from the moment.  &quot;I'll... I'll uh just take some measurements, you know, to help.  Then we can go down stairs, I live down there, to sleep.  But notttt together or anything just to sleep.  Separately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*burrpp* Ok.&quot;  Scott just smiled and saved me from my schoolgirl with a crush routine.<br />
<br />
I went to a desk draw and looked for a bigger tape measure than what I had used before.  I turned to see Scott but now his stomach was slowly bulging out.  It looked like it was inflating, his navel growing larger as it formed a sphere.  It reminded me of someone inflating a beach ball.  My hard on started leaking and I thought I would blow my load right then and there.  It stopped, looking 9 months pregnant except that his gut didn't droop but defied gravity.  He caught me looking at his gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Yeah, I was just sucking it in before.&quot;  He sucked it in then slowly let it back out, to show his point and causing another monstrous belch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but from now on- no more secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scouts honour.  Better yet, a gas pact!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;A gas pact.  Just made it up to fit the occasion.  Come on, all you do is *buuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrp*.  Like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was just so enthusiastic I had to give in.  I swallowed some air and gave a small burp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, a real one.&quot;  I tried again, only to meet more disapproval.  &quot;Nah, you want me to help?&quot;  Scott took a deep breath and just as i was about to ask -what help?- he pushed his lips on mine and opened his mouth, breathing out.  He wrapped his sturdy body around mine and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
It was a strange sensation, almost like a kiss.  This changed when I could feel him stop exhaling.  He opened his eyes wide as he burped directly into my mouth!  I could feel a hot gas flood my mouth and go down my throat.  As both of our bodies were flush, I could feel his stomach deflate back down to what I thought it had expanded to originally.<br />
<br />
To my horror something else happened.  My stomach began to expand and inflate like his once had, filling the gap between us!  We separated as he farted to look at the damage.  My gut was still slowly inflating, pushing against the confines of my jeans and shirt.  Slowly a large globe formed and the button on my jeans popped under its force.  It continued to grow and small crescents of skin appeared between the buttons of my top.  All went flying off as the bloating continued, which stopped shortly after.<br />
<br />
I was stuck with a huge beach ball for a stomach!  Scott stepped back and I dropped the measuring tape.  I bent down to pick it up, only to do a fart as big as Scott's monsters.  This act, unlike Scott, let me deflate somewhat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it isn't permanent- for me at least&quot;  I tested it by belching (one that Scott would approve of) ad found that I had shrunk back down to an almost normal size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot;  Scott said as he sat back on a bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're taking this rather well.&quot; I said as I moved to him with the measuring tape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. *uuuuuuuurp* Being this big ain't so bad now.&quot;  <br />
<br />
