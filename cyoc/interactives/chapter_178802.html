<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily gasped. She was awestruck.<br />
<br />
She didn’t know what to do. She realised quickly the responsibilities that had suddenly been put on her. She had a daughter, a child. How old was she? Was she young? A tween, even a teen? Or was she an adult? So many questions flooded her mind.<br />
<br />
But the first thing she needed was to look at her.<br />
<br />
“Give me a moment...” she hesitated after yelling what she guess was downstairs, “sweetheart..?” She said kind of awkwardly. She didn’t know what to say.<br />
She rushed back into her giant bedroom and scanned it. She saw what seemed to be some relatively presentable clothes. She quickly put them on.<br />
<br />
She pulled up a pair of skinny jeans, they were ripped, with the intent of fashion, around her thighs. She struggled to get them past her butt. She knew it was bigger, but this problem hadn’t ever crossed her mind. She pulled them as hard as she could and they slipped on. She quickly buttoned and zipped them up. Luckily for her, there were a grand total of two articles of clothing, excluding shoes. She took off her lavender t-shirt, revealing her naked chest. She didn’t have time to focus on them, but she almost wished she did. She then realised she needed a bra.<br />
She looked around the room and found a chest of drawers. Picking up the shirt and bringing it along with her. She half jogged to the drawers. As she did, she realised just how much her breasts bounced. It wasn’t exaggerated as she thought, they dropped downwards, and thus their weight also slightly reflected that. She made it to the drawers.<br />
Opening the top drawer, she found a lot of socks and some normal looking panties, along with some promiscuous ones too. Not seeing any bras, she closed it and pulled open the next one. The whole drawer was filled to the brim with very nicely organised bras. She had so many options to pick from. She found some sports bras, some laced bras, even a maternity bra. She wanted to chose a bra that she wouldn’t attract any unwanted attention, but there weren’t too many, she ended up choosing a white bra that didn’t make her nipples poke out too much. As she reached around to clip it, she realised just how much larger her bust looked. She almost wanted to back out but couldn’t waste any more time. Looked down at her chest. Her cleavage seemed to be slightly accentuated... but this wasn’t even a push up bra. <br />
She then grabbed the button up shirt and began to do it up. She started at the top... if you could even call it that. The buttons started right where her cleavage began, giving her a perfect view of what her new assets could do. She buttoned up around her bust, noticing just how tight it was. She managed to do up the final button at the bottom. These things really posed a challenge.<br />
She was ready, her makeup wasn’t done but who needed it. She wanted to see her daughter.<br />
<br />
She rushed out of the bedroom door to find herself in yet another room, smaller, but also the size of a small apartment. On her right was a bookshelf with a variety of untouched books by what looks like philosophers or something. That was the only decor in that room. On her right was a door, and like all the other doors, it was glass. She could see inside. It was another bathroom.<br />
She hadn’t even left the bedroom and she found another bathroom.<br />
She continued forward, out the next set of doors.<br />
<br />
She found herself in a large open space. It wasn’t a specific room. There was a staircase going down to the next floor. On her left was a large set of windows going onto a balcony. On her right were two sets of sofas against a wall with two evenly spaced windows. In between was a small table and a number of houseplants. How the hell did they keep all this stuff alive. On the wall adjacent to this, blocking off the stairs was another bookshelf. This one looked a lot more used. On the top of it, engraved on a gold plaque, was written:<br />
“Abigail”<br />
That might be her daughters name, then again, she didn’t know. She really didn’t want to risk it. She had to pretend like she knew what was going on before she could sit down and figure it all out.<br />
At the end of that hallway was another set of glass doors, this one going into another room.<br />
The only thing visible from outside it was a piano, but the windows were cloudy by design. However she didn’t have time to snoop around her own house, she had to find her daughter.<br />
<br />
“Uh... sweetheart?” Emily yelled out again, trying to figure out where her daughter could actually be in this labyrinth of a house.<br />
“Mom, I’m in here, do you have it?” Her voice once again yelled. Her attitude reminded her of herself when she was younger. She realised that the voice was coming from the room with the piano. “Mom, please! I’m gonna be late!!” She yelled through her teeth.<br />
<br />
Emily quickly pulled the doors open, seeing the piano dead centre in the room. As she went deeper, she found that there was a split in the room, which opened to a whole other bedroom. Perhaps this was her daughters bedroom.<br />
She looked around but failed to see where her daughter could be. She looked to her right and saw the doors to a closet. On the side, next to those doors was a long yet skinny mirror. She caught herself, she hadn’t noticed it, but the button up shirt was strained open slightly right at the centre of her chest. She could see her bra and a portion of her breast.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, those doors burst open, out burst what Emily could only assume to be.<br />
<br />
Her daughter.</p>
