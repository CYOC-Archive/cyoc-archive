<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul stared at himself in the mirror, not liking what he was seeing. The cut-off, button-fly shorts. The tight white t-shirt that exposed his midriff. The hair, which he worked with such ease, done up in such an adorable manner. All this, combined with how he was standing and thinking off himself made Paul think he was looking at a young woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least my chest is not quite as sensitive,&quot; Paul thought as he placed a hand on his chest, feeling the slightly change that had occurred there.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he exited the bathroom and immediately ran into Tanya. Embarrassed to be seen like this, Paul slipped past her, missing the sleepy look in her eyes. Hurrying through the apartment, he decided to skip breakfast and head for the library and the computers they had for public use.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
It was at the library he had been spending the last couple of days searching for an answer as to why a man would suddenly start to turn into a woman. Taking a seat, he logged on and as he was waiting, Paul looked at a cute boy sitting a couple seats over. <br />
<br />
Realising that he was staring, Paul turned before the boy could realise that he was being looked and blushing, Paul began to search once again for an answer to his problem.<br />
<br />
An hour later, he had returned to the apartment, glad that Tanya had gone to work. Entering the bathroom, he gazed into the mirror, wondering what sort of changes he would find. As he looked into the reflective depths, he also listened to the silent apartment in case Tanya came home early.<br />
<br />
Reflected back, Paul noticed that he had shrunk in height and studying his reflection, he guess his height to be about five foot five now. Turning sideways, he groaned in despair as it became apparent that his breast size had grown over the morning.<br />
<br />
Removing his shirt, he looked at the erect nipples, the areolas that appeared a bit larger and the milky white mounds that made up his chest. Staring at the breasts, he made a rough guess and thought that they might be somewhere between an A cup and a B cup. Gently touching them, he received a shock when a jolt of pleasure rippled through his body.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head and thinking to himself, &quot;Uh-uh. None of that,&quot; he hastily donned his shirt, liking the feeling of the soft fabric against his chest.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he looked over the rest of his body. His legs...which had lost all of the hair they had to begin with...looked a little longer, while his thighs and waist had taken on a more feminine appearance. Turning around, Paul thought that his butt looked rounder and more feminine as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sighing heavily, he exited the bathroom, wondering what he was going to do for the rest of the day. &quot;There's no way I am going into work looking like this,&quot; Paul thought as he headed for the kitchen. &quot;Maybe I can go to the local swimming pool. I got such a darling bikini that I've been wanting to show off,&quot; he thought and the stopped as he realised what it was that he had been thinking.<br />
<br />
Sighing once again, he walked into the kitchen, wondering what it was he done to deserve what was happening to him and how to reverse it.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Tanya let herself in and kicking off her work shoes, she hung up her jacket. Looking about the darkened apartment, she wondered if Paul was home and how much more he looked like a girl. Stealing quietly through the apartment, she pushed open the bedroom door and looked in.<br />
<br />
Lying on the bed in a pair of bikini briefs and a tank top, Tanya thought that Paul looked so much like she did when she had been fifteen. Looking at her husband, taking in the young nubile body, the B sized breasts, Tanya realised that it wasn't just Paul who was changing, but the other part of her wish was coming true.<br />
<br />
Grinning, she entered the room, making sure she didn't wake Paul in the process. Stealing over to her closet, she extracted the three items she had bought a couple days ago and crept back out of the bedroom and to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, she quickly stripped herself of the clothes she had been wearing all day and then began to redress herself in the costume she had bought.<br />
<br />
First she pinned up her hair and then placed over it a skull cap and wig. Next she bandaged her chest so that it was flat and then pulled on a shirt that felt and looked like the torso section of a male. Afterward, she strapped on a dildo that looked, felt and...with a built in motor...acted like a real penis.<br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror, Tanya grinned and then in a husky voice, she told herself, &quot;Honey, if you were really a man, I'd be all over you in a heartbeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, she exited the bathroom and crept back to the bedroom. Inside, she noted that the time was about nine eighteen and then slowly slid into bed. Beside her, Paul stirred and then whispered, &quot;Honey? Is that you?&quot; in a soft, feminine voice.<br />
<br />
Grinning in the dark, Tanya replied in a husky voice, hoping she sounded masculine, &quot;Relax baby. It is only me,&quot; and then snuggled closer.<br />
<br />
Immediately Paul moaned pleasurably in a sleepy tone and moved closer the moment he felt the penis that Tanya was wearing pressed up against him. In a quiet voice filled with sleep, he exclaimed, &quot;Make love to me, Gary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning some more, wondering how it was a man made love to a woman, Tanya decided to wing-it and then in the husky voice, she said, &quot;Anything for my Pauline.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching down, Tanya pressed a hidden button and immediately the strap-on began to work much like a real penis. Cupping Pauline's left breast, Tanya gently kissed the woman her husband was becoming. As Tanya kissed her, Pauline first removed her tank top and then her underwear. And while she and Tanya slowly melted into each other, lost in the moment, they failed to realise what was happening to each other or that around them.</p>
