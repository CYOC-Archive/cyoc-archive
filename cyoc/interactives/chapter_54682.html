<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Luna and Sunny changed back from golden and silver statues with clocks in their <br />
pregnant looking bellies, the sense of clockwork efficiency their spiritual aura was <br />
encouraging through the estate vanished with it. No one having a clue where it had come <br />
from or where it had gone.  And truth be told, those who were aware of it's short coming <br />
and going on the night shift would indeed miss it. <br />
<br />
Helen asked in Kira's mind, herself still a fountain head in the front yard as Kira was a <br />
statue in the entry way, 'You were really hoping you'd convinced them to join our life style <br />
hadn't you Kira?'<br />
<br />
'And what if I did?... I have a right to speak out on the virtues of my way of living... We all <br />
made our choice. It's not a crime to offer the same choice to others... '<br />
<br />
'Hoping they could have been your brides for eternity Kira? I must say the male mind set <br />
must be effecting you.' Helen said amused. <br />
<br />
'Nothing wrong with being male.' Nessie inserted. <br />
<br />
'We don't have real genders, we're souls whose bodies are art that happen to appear to <br />
have one gender or another... '<br />
<br />
'You could always try to convince some of the pups or cubs to join in, something about one <br />
of those quadruplets makes me think she wants to join us even though she doesn't know <br />
that we even are.'<br />
<br />
'DON'T EVEN joke.' Kira thought, 'You think I'd offer this choice to someone whose too <br />
young to even comprehend the full scale of that choice? Don't confuse me with the <br />
monsters who tricked innocent people into signing a piece of paper they felt would protect <br />
them legally from police if it was found out their gallery was full of people.'<br />
<br />
'I know Kira I know, sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.'<br />
<br />
'What made souled art ugly was that it was just another name for slavery and <br />
imprisonment. We are this way because we've accepted it.'<br />
<br />
'And the more souled art we collect the more happy Alpha Kaylee shall be, we know.'<br />
<br />
All the living art agreed to that. <br />
<br />
Leslie said from her spot next to Nessie and Helen, the zen like feeling of the water flowing <br />
through and effectively being part of Glenale herself being part of her water system. 'They'll <br />
come to us, of their own free will as they should. We call out, they answer back and we'll <br />
welcome them into our sub-pack.'<br />
<br />
'I still find it weird we gained this power, game being brain dead or not.' Helen thought. <br />
<br />
'I believe simply it was the only way we could indoctrinate volunteers without the direct <br />
power of the game itself. And her, Glendale herself, knows better than ANYONE, having <br />
witnessed all of it, that this game has to end.' <br />
<br />
'You know I had an amusing thought, of Kimberly joining our pack after she realizes she <br />
can still be pink as a statue...' <br />
<br />
Helen said, 'Her joining us is just fantasy.'<br />
<br />
'I know. That's what makes it fun to pretend.' <br />
<br />
'Is that why you've chosen to stay male until Luna and Sunny die of old age, marry, or <br />
chose to become part of our sub pack?'<br />
<br />
'Heh... I was thinking that load?' <br />
<br />
'Yes.'<br />
<br />
'I think if they chose to stay mortal and marry someone else I think I'll make myself look <br />
like a statue of one of them for their wedding for fun...  It seem Trinity also let some facts <br />
slide, like our particular Transform of fate makes it IMPOSSIBLE for us to be smashed, <br />
broken, stolen, or neglected...' <br />
 <br />
'Guess that fear back when were in he gallery, alone, unable to speak to each other, and <br />
being smashed, stolen or broke WAS a possibility got to her more than it got to the rest of <br />
us.'<br />
<br />
'We were ALL terrified at that!' <br />
<br />
'Seems she might have been scared of it more than us. People experience different levels of <br />
fear, it happens.' <br />
<br />

Father Mike, for one of the few times in his life, lost his cool calm demeanor, &quot;... this is not <br />
good, this is not good at all! Not in the least!&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity blinked, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THERE CAN'T be family size elbow room at the top of the food chain! The eccosystem and <br />
laws of supply and consumption wouldn't allow it!  I'm thinking that dragons appear to be <br />
exist in the three digit range at best, and the lion and wolf people I think were pulling <br />
things thin as it was! But MORE sentient species could cause there have been MORE WARS <br />
through history then there already were! It would be horrid!&quot; <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity got into a thinking pose, &quot;Maybe things aren't as they appear then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One, Father Paul is still naked while you're still wearing your priestly robes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both men started at this, both had gotten so used to it they felt it wasn't even worth noting <br />
or even registering in their minds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two, if everyone who had ever been effected by the game had always been as they were, <br />
then no one would have ever used the game and the game would have never existed in the <br />
first place and as you said before, Anthropic principle. We wouldn't BE HERE making a cure <br />
for the Game if the game hadn't become the silent epidemic it has.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the men nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three, there are many people who have been turned into objects by the game, many. If <br />
they had always been as they were, then they'd never been in a position to HAVE souls in <br />
the first place, effectively killing them, and reality self seems to be using 'good-bye, never <br />
saw you' as a last resort.  Something else is behind this...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Something that makes more sense than god's reality having assimilated us into the new <br />
existence?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted. But maybe we need to think of it from the other perspective, what makes LESS -<br />
nonsense!- You said it yourself that the laws of ecology wouldn't allow for a large number <br />
of equal positions on the food chain. And living art victims would lose their souls and NO <br />
ONE WOULD HAVE EVER PLAYED THE GAME EVER if this continues to shock wave to it's <br />
logical conclusion, and like you said, you wouldn't have discovered the cure FOR the game <br />
if you both hadn't become VICTIMS of the game. It would create a -paradox- and reality <br />
does not tolerate paradoxes. And if no one played the game ever, or at least the levels we <br />
know it's been played, we wouldn't be here creating a cure in such massive amounts to <br />
begin with!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pretty sure there is no such thing as being 'semi-assimilated' into reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So am I, but seriously we're all flying blind here. Father, do you still have your ID with <br />
you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Mike, the one wearing clothes, nodded, and took out his photo, &quot;Still shows a <br />
human being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this barely makes any sense in comparison, but it could be your curses bled over <br />
due to being exposed to so much of incomplete cure repeated for so long... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't changed. And neither has Judas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My curse says -in particular- that it's impossible for me to  be change, be altered, et <br />
cetera , et cetera. Judas doesn't have a turn at the game.... although, he might have <br />
something else to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain fully please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he really is a descendant of one of the witches' familiars. Then he might have acted as a <br />
medium causing the curses to bridge over after being weakened by the cure caused by the <br />
fundamental truth in both your minds you're brothers causing your curses to bleed over to <br />
accommodate that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that even make sense?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes more sense than us making a cure for a game that if things follow to their logical <br />
conclusion no one ever played! Now let's have breakfast and get back to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judas and the priests all nodded at this. <br />

In spite of Monica shorted and slighted for her now reduced status, she kept her job as a <br />
teacher of the word of the Lord to the next generation. Being told the finer points of the <br />
Lord's word by a fellow child had not been easy for any of the students. And she had to <br />
fight keep her task twice in the last five years. <br />
<br />
One of her problem students, Gita, seemed particularly surprised at this.  Monica <br />
remembered, all three had come and gone through her class, they had gotten their <br />
christian names and had each recited the christian creeds perfectly. They also never seem <br />
to try to make friends.<br />
<br />
In fact, the three girls had a good deal of experience making friends. <br />
<br />
Monica's mundane human senses couldn't see the children who they did make friends with <br />
ended up Gold Deer, Fairies, Dolls, or pieces of art. <br />
<br />
Monica had noticed she was aging at only relatively half the speed she should have been. <br />
She had her good cry and moan about that and moved on. She knew she wouldn't be <br />
moaning about it soon enough. Though one moment of time of regaining decades of youth <br />
was one thing, aging at half the speed she should have began to get people's attention. <br />
She wondered if she'd have to leave Glendale once she was old enough to find a husband, <br />
again. <br />
<br />
Monica did notice however, the girls went through the entire ceremony of receiving their <br />
Christian Names as if they were puppets in a show, there was no emotion behind their <br />
actions during the entire mass at all. <br />
<br />
Something in Monica's gut was very happy to see each of them leave her class, and a <br />
feeling of dread when the other entered, though she knew thinking such thoughts about <br />
innocent children was wrong. And they were just innocent children. <br />

<br />
The loud chiming of a clock echoed through the misty streets as a blond teenage girl <br />
walked through the lantern dotted night.  She walked calmly and evenly one in front of <br />
another, a lady's umbrella open and laid on one shoulder.  Contrary to how she was <br />
dressed, she openly displayed an eyepatch contrasting the entire effect of her demeanor <br />
and frilly dress. <br />
<br />
A huge lupin form emerged from the mists behind her. His fur as black as midnight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely night for a stroll love... &quot; He whispered hotly to her in one ear, &quot;But a lady like you <br />
shouldn't but out all alone, isn't proper 'en all... why don't I escort you along to where ya <br />
going? Be many a bad man about here tonight I hear. Any old Jack can come along and <br />
damage a pretty thing like you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you but no thank you.&quot; She said politely and calmly, being proper and looking him <br />
in the eyes with her good one. She tightened her grip on the little umbrella. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh love, but I insist...&quot; He reached out one giant paw at her shoulder on the side of her <br />
ruined eye in her blind spot. <br />
<br />
Immediately in one fluid motion she pirouetted around and released the hidden sword in <br />
the lady's umbrella, slicing into his arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU FITHLY MONKEY!&quot; The lupman swore using the racial slur for human being. <br />
<br />
He backed off before she could stab him in the stomach. He then dodged to the side and <br />
charged at her blind side, but -again- it was like the eye-patch wasn't even there and she <br />
reacted like she knew where he struck before he did! <br />
<br />
The sword went through his paw's major nerve, severing it, she slashed the weapon <br />
between the bones of his claws leaving his hand worthless and bleeding. <br />
<br />
This battle not really going how he intended it, and there always being more women <br />
elsewhere, he turned around... exposing the back of his knees. He had gotten exactly five <br />
leaping bounds before he felt something fast and sharp impale him in the legs, causing <br />
him to fall foreword and skid, shedding fur and leaving skin raw. <br />
<br />
'This has to be a bad dream!' He thought. <br />
<br />
That was when he heard his worst fear, the sound of the police.<br />
<br />
He felt someone pull the sharp blades out of his legs and wipe them on his fur, he turned <br />
around and slashed her face off, but he easily dodged it, though there should have been no <br />
logical way a human being could have reacted in time!<br />
<br />
She stabbed him through the elbow. He snarled and hissed at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the police's problem now, I'll leave you to them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Finnish me off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it! Or I swear! I'll hunt you down and eat you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't be hunting anything with those legs ever again, good luck on relearning how to <br />
walk.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn you women! Damn all of you! I'll take the lot of you and RIP YOU! And if not me! <br />
Then one of my pups! And if not one of them! Then one of their pups! And he shall RIP you! <br />
And RIP you! Do you hear me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The young lady wasted all of five seconds before the police arrived turning her head and <br />
said in a calm even voice, &quot;Good-bye 'Jack.'&quot; And walked away. <br />
<br />
The police found the crippled lupman howling and snarling a few minutes later. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Earlier that morning, Tabby held a letter addressed to simply 'Trevor, leoman.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Someone has way too much money.&quot; Tabby thought the letter having come overnight <br />
express mail to the station shortly before she arrived, &quot;Or they're really impulsive in how <br />
they spend it.&quot; <br />
<br />
The men at the station however weren't that interested in her, instead they were chatting <br />
about, &quot;You seen the chief this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She seem more rigid than usual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you ask me she really just needs a boy friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
After going through the method to make sure what Tabby had waiting for her wasn't a <br />
letter bomb, the police simply let her go.  Of course, Tabby wasn't about to let thing go <br />
that easily! <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm her roommates!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we can't just give away where a cop is healing up, we make enemies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask Chief Gillie! She knows me!&quot;</p>
