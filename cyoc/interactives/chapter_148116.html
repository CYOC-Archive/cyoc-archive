<br/>
Enjoy!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    A perverted grin crosses Kairos&#39; serpentine maw as he eyes the small vulnerable form of Thorin. The kobold&#39;s yellow scales appeared soft and enticing, the very <i>thought</i> of rubbing up against him caused the snakeman to salivate.<br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s breath quickens as Kairos&#39; long serpentine tail inches toward him, shuddering as it coils around his leg and makes its way into his robe, the tip teasing his sensitive slit.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Pl… <i>Please</i>…&quot; Tears fill the small lizardboy&#39;s amber eyes as the snakeman, his <i>friend</i>, merely grins in sensual lust at his fear and unwilling arousal.<br />
<br />
    &quot;There&#39;sssss no need to be ssscared, Thorin. I can ssssave you…&quot; The yellow kobold&#39;s eyes clench shut in fear as his lower jaw is taken into Kairos&#39; claws, the wetness of the serpentman&#39;s scales causing his own to shiver.<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Mmmm</i>...&quot; Kairos&#39; claws lustfully caress the kobold&#39;s bare scales on his exposed arms, before one hand slips beneath his shirt, groping his chest. &quot;You&#39;re so… <i>warm</i>... So <i>soft</i>...&quot;<br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s cry of fear is muffled as a hand clasps around his maw.<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Ssssshhhh</i>...&quot; Kairos&#39; serpent-like head shakes in twisted contempt, as if he pitied the yellow reptile. &quot;I suppose it&#39;sss normal to be ssscared, but I know how to fix that… How to get you to <i>accept</i> me--&quot; <br />
<br />
    <i>Click</i><br />
<br />
    Glancing up, Thorin&#39;s amber eyes look past Kairos&#39; shoulder, a joyful grin crossing his maw.<br />
<br />
    <i>Clack</i><br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; serpentine gaze follows suit, gazing on in interest at the tall form of a woman, the faint candle light causing her glasses to glint menacingly. <br />
<br />
    &quot;You know, I often <i>try</i> to avoid doing this in my Sunday best.&quot; The woman mutters, flipping her hair back. Kairos sighs in annoyance at Cynthia&#39;s untimely appearance. Rising up and ceasing his torturing of Thorin, the snakeman&#39;s tail coils around the kobold to prevent his escape.<br />
<br />
    Adjusting her glasses, Cynthia&#39;s grey eyes pierce into Kairos, her threatening gaze causing a part of him to tremble.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I believe it&#39;d be in your best interest to put the boy down, serpent. You&#39;ve already made quite the mess of my library&#39;s floorboards.&quot; Giving a cheeky grin, Cynthia points a finger to the conspicuous puddle of white liquid. Kairos merely grins back in response, remaining still.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Come now! Is it that difficult of a task to do? The least I&#39;ll have you do is clean it up for me with your tongue.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Kairos only chuckles in response, his laughs fading to low hisses at the woman&#39;s words. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that, <i>madam</i>. But ssssay, maybe you could clean sssomething <i>else</i> for me and then I&#39;ll let him go?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Cynthia playfully smiles in response, bringing her index finger to her cheek. &quot;You know, I&#39;m not much for the talkative types. How about we have a little <i>fun</i>, instead? Judging by those swords you&#39;re brandishing I&#39;m sure you must be absolutely <i>thirsting</i> for some.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;I think I&#39;d rather have fun with <i>thisss</i> one…&quot; The woman&#39;s grin shifts to a scowl as the blue serpentman&#39;s tail constricts around Thorin, forcing him to wheeze for air as it crushes him.<br />
<br />
    Shrugging, Cynthia&#39;s eyes flash, her voice dropping an octave. &quot;A shame. But if that&#39;s how you really feel, I suppose I&#39;ll just have to put on a show for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Before he can return his share of banter, Kairos&#39; jaws snap shut, the tip of Cynthia&#39;s heeled foot driving into his face. The shock from the blow forces his tail to release the yellow kobold from its grip.<br />
<br />
    Smashing into a bookcase, Kairos grunts as Cynthia lifts him into the air by his neck, her eyes burning with a calm rage. Turning to the large glass window that adorned the front of the library, Cynthia yells as she tosses the blue snakeman directly towards it.<br />
<br />
    Breaking through the glass, Kairos&#39; serpent-like form rolls and tumbles across the dirt road of the town, before landing painfully on his jaws. Stars fading from his vision, the serpent spits blood before wiping the remaining traces of red liquid from his maw.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I must say little one, you truly have some bizarre acquaintances. I&#39;ll try not to dance with him too long.&quot; A cheeky grin from the tall woman causes the small Kobold below her to blush. <br />
<br />
    Panting and regaining his breath, Thorin&#39;s gentle amber eyes light up as Cynthia extends her hand. Taking it, the kobold&#39;s yells as she brings him to his feet. <br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s black heels click loudly as she struts over to the broken window, glancing back at the yellow kobold with a reassuring wink. Her glasses glinting, she points to the floor below him. Glancing to his feet, Thorin gasps as he retrieves an ornate white tome, it&#39;s cover adorned with the symbol of an eagle-like creature. It was <i>his</i> tome!<br />
<br />
    &quot;You really need to stop leaving your tome inside your rented books, little one. Didn&#39;t that old man at the academy teach you how to be organized?&quot; Her eyes roll as the kobold&#39;s nervously chuckles in response, fidgeting with the tome in his claws. &quot;Well, if you&#39;re going to come watch our dance you&#39;d better not get frisky.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Sighing, Cynthia leaps from the window without any further comments, dirt and dust scattering about as she lands a few yards away from Kairos&#39; rising form. <br />
<br />
    A smirk crosses the librarian&#39;s face as she adjusts her glasses, eyes shining in anticipation. The serpentman&#39;s slit eyes glare back, fangs protruding from his jaws. Stiffening her posture, Cynthia positions her left arm in front of herself and her right arm upwards beside her head, her hands pulsing with a purple glow.<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Bring it</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos darts towards the librarian&#39;s dark form, his clawed fingers outspread. Clumsily thrusting his claws towards Cynthia&#39;s face, the librarian merely tilts her head, the white tips grazing her hair. Wrapping one arm around Kairos&#39; own, a hiss slips from the snakeman&#39;s maw as his entire form suddenly lies against the ground, the woman&#39;s heel repeatedly driving into his scaled chest.<br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s movements stall as she senses the serpent&#39;s tail behind her, dodging a second too late to avoid it&#39;s sweep. Withholding a gasp as the ground is swept from beneath her feet, time appears to slow as Cynthia&#39;s legs lock around the now standing Kairos&#39; torso, the blue serpent hissing in surprise. His hiss shifts to a grunt as Cynthia delivers a punch to his jaw, causing his head to spin as a crack echoes throughout his head.<br />
<br />
    Releasing her legs from the snake&#39;s torso, the black haired librarian cartwheels away, gracefully landing to feet. Clasping his jaw, Kairos hastily snaps it back into place, wiping the blood from his maw.<br />
<br />
    Claws smacking against the ground alert both witch and snake, the setting sun reflecting off yellow scales. <br />
<br />
    Tome in hand, the pages of Thorin&#39;s spellbook flip open as his other hand radiates a yellow glow. The kobold&#39;s face stretches into a cheeky smile as dust scatters about, although a hint of seriousness lies within his eyes.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I&#39;ll use my magic to hold him still! Make sure to pin him down after so I can use my magic to separate the mask from him!&quot; Adjusting her glasses, Cynthia&#39;s lips spread into a smile. <br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; deranged eyes bear into the kobold menacingly, amusement filling him as the yellow reptile does not waver despite his visible trembling. <br />
<br />
    &quot;I… am more than just a <i>mask</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
    Evading a blow from Cynthia, the serpentman bounds off her form, directing himself towards Thorin. <br />
<br />
    Instead of yelping or fleeing in fright, the kobold&#39;s clawed fingers begin to crackle with magic, his determination overtaking his fear. Waving an arm in front of himself, a circular rune forms as his hand returns to the center of it, the runes alternating between black and white. Glancing to the pages of his tome, his amber orbs glint as a familiar incantation comes upon his tongue.<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Bound by fate, black and white come together to form gray</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Ivory Chains!&quot;<br />
<br />
    Smashing his tome shut and closing his eyes, the rune in front of the kobold splits and lengthens into the shape of four grey chains, each one orbiting Thorin&#39;s small form.<br />
<br />
    Kairos grunts as his mad dash towards the yellow scaled pest ends with him tripping. Digging his claws into the ground to catch himself, the snake scowls as Cynthia tauntingly beckons him. His attempts of blindly rushing fourth fall short once again as a gray chain snaps around his legs and tail, binding them together and digging into his scales.<br />
<br />
    Glancing towards the source of the chains proves to be his undoing, the moment of vulnerability allowing Thorin to have another chain constrict around his arms. Grunting, Kairos futilely squirms as Cynthia&#39;s arms lock around his neck, her face leaning over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
    A smack to the face foils the snakeman&#39;s attempt to bite her.<br />
<br />
    Forcefully bending Kairos to his knees, Cynthia gestures the yellow form of Thorin to come over. Hesitence fills the kobold, but it is disregarded as Cynthia nods reassuringly. <br />
<br />
    Standing before Kairos&#39; bound form, the chains orbiting around the kobold&#39;s form freeze behind him. Setting his tome to the ground, Thorin&#39;s clawed hands reach up to caress the serpentman&#39;s face, the yellow scales on his arms shining with a white light. His amber eyes close in concentration.<br />
<br />
    The feeling of the lizardboy&#39;s warm soft scaled hands against his face drive Kairos&#39; mind into an unusual serenity. If he could free his tail...<br />
<br />
    &quot;...The mask i-is bound to him, I-I don&#39;t think I can take it off...&quot; Cynthia&#39;s grey eyes glance at Thorin&#39;s concentrating face in puzzlement. &quot;It&#39;s like something is stopping the flow of my magic from digging inside…&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Have you tried <i>pulling</i>?&quot; One of Thorin&#39;s eyes pops open befuddled, eliciting a small laugh from Cynthia as his face twists into uncertainty.<br />
<br />
    &quot;T-The mask, before it merged with his face I felt another presence alongside us, like we were being watched…&quot; Thorin&#39;s head turns back to the library, remembering the wolf mask. &quot;N-No… these masks, they have…&quot;<br />
<br />
    Fearfully glancing back to Kairos, Thorin&#39;s amber eyes dig into the snakeman&#39;s blue orbs. &quot;The spell uttered by that mage, Serpent&#39;s Kiss…&quot; His slit eyes dilate in dreadful realization.<br />
<br />
    Stumbling backwards, Thorin&#39;s breath quickens much to Cynthia&#39;s dismay. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Y-You! <i>You&#39;re</i> that mage! You bound your soul to that spell, and after it killed Orveus your soul bound itself to his cursed blood that splashed onto Kairos!&quot; The snake&#39;s face twists into a depraved grin, a low gravelly hiss slipping from his maw.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You possessss incredible analytical skillsss, despite having ssssuch a pitiful appearance.&quot; His chest vibrates in laughter as Cynthia reaffirms her grip on him. &quot;Try all you want, witch. I&#39;ll essscape you and ssssave him.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I believe you and I possess <em>completely</em> different concepts of what saving is, <i>serpent</i>.&quot; The blue reptile is undeterred by the venom dripping from the librarian&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
    Anxiously fidgeting with his claws, Thorin glances back up at the snakeman. &quot;I, <em>we</em> can&#39;t call <i>you</i> Kairos, so who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;...My name isss… Kenosss.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;I am… I <i>wasss</i> a part of that pathetic excusssse of a clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Thorin fearfully recalls the conversation he and Kairos had prior to this mess. &quot;The clan that&#39;s been kidnapping all those young men… Kairos said you were the son of-&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;That good for nothing excusse of a father doesss not desssserve to call me hisss sssson!&quot; Thorin yelps as Kenos&#39; jaws lurch fourth, the snake&#39;s fangs mere inches from his snout. <br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s fingers dig into the serpentman&#39;s throat, her mouth a hair&#39;s breadth from his ears.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You best stay in line, another wrong move and I may have to break you.&quot; Broken cackles echo from Kenos&#39; jaws, his purple eyes shining in madness.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You&#39;ll only ssssucceed in breaking the worthlessss human beneath thesse sssscales. Besidesss, I can sssee that you&#39;ve forgotten much of your hissstory, <i>sorceresss</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Enlighten me then.&quot; Cynthia&#39;s fingers pull away from his scaled throat, opting to adjust her glasses. &quot;But first, I&#39;ll ask again for the little one; why are you kidnapping all those young men?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Copulation</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Cynthia and Thorin stare at the snakeman dumbfounded, a devious smirk forming across Kenos&#39; maw. &quot;Our clan boosts it&#39;s numbers by converting virile and virgin human men to our race; lizardmen.&quot; A laugh from Kenos&#39; snaps both witch and mage from their stunned states.<br />
<br />
    &quot;W-Why?!&quot; Thorin&#39;s words muffle as his hands clasp his maw, his amber eyes wide as dinner plates.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You&#39;d never underssstand our reasssons, <i>kobold</i>. The sssages and sorcererss failed to sssustain balance all those eons ago. We ssseek to ssssucceed where they failed.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s head shakes, his voice taking on an annoyed tone. &quot;Nothing you&#39;re saying makes a semblance of sense! Why would you take men and transform them into your kind to boost your numbers when you can just <i>have sex</i>?!&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;They are required for another purpossse, one that femalesss cannot provide.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;And that purpose is?!&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;We require their <i>ssseed</i>.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s face twists into disgust while Cynthia merely groans, bringing a hand to her brow. &quot;You lizardmen are awfully frisky, yet here even in the shape of a snakeman and in another&#39;s body, you remain unchanged. What fuels your depravity?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;We have our reasssonss, ssorceresss. How unfortunate that our clan hasss accomplissshed more for thisss world than yourss ever did.&quot; Rolling her eyes Cynthia releases Kenos from her arms, the snakeman falling face first onto the dirt road with a grunt.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I&#39;d ask for a history lesson, but I believe this conversation has gone on long enough. When I cut off these chains, it&#39;d be in your best interest to return to that mask and give Kairos back.&quot; Cynthia&#39;s grey eyes narrow at Kenos&#39; shallow laugh, grinding her heel into the arch of the serpentman&#39;s back in annoyance. His laugh fading to low hisses, Kenos&#39; head cranes, his eye glaring at Cynthia deviously.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You and the hatchling are embarrassingly naive dessspite being able to wield magic. I can undersssstand the hatchling, but <i>you</i>? I <i>can&#39;t</i> be taken off. Me and him, we are one and the sssame, we are effectively bound together, our ssssouls are <i>one</i>.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Rubbing her temples in annoyance, Cynthia rolls her eyes as she steps off Kenos. &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll have to perform an exorcism.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Another laugh from Kenos sends chills down Thorin&#39;s spine. Ignoring the feeling, the yellow kobold ponders how to restore Kairos to normal. He must have done <i>something</i> to force Orveus and Kenos&#39; to take the shape of masks. It was clear he hadn&#39;t worn either mask since his original transformation…<br />
<br />
    As both sorceress and apprentice stand in thought, the snake grins as a familiar magical energy radiates through his scales. He had to admit; for an apprentice the kobold was rather exceptional, but his power paled in comparison to his own. The witch on the other hand was rusty; her style unpolished and wild.<br />
<br />
    They didn&#39;t see it coming.<br />
<br />
    With a burst of blue light, Cynthia and Thorin were sent flying back, the kobold&#39;s white tome slipping free from his fingers and falling into Kenos&#39; own claws. <br />
<br />
    Breaking her fall with a roll, Cynthia leaps towards the flying form of Thorin, gently catching him in her arms. Landing to her feet with a twirl, Cynthia&#39;s eyes pierce into Kenos&#39; own eyes.<br />
<br />
    &quot;M-My tome!&quot; The serpentman stares at the eagle-like figure on the white cover, eyes lighting up in curiousity at the kobold&#39;s fearful tone.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Not only an apprentice; but going to an academy full of arrogant would-be magesss? Sssshameful.&quot; Flipping through its pages with ease, a grin crosses his jaws. <br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Bound by fate, light and darkness merge to form chaos</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>Ebony Chainsss</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    With a snap of his fingers, chains of energy coil around Cynthia&#39;s form, binding her legs and arms together. Even as Thorin&#39;s small form slips through, the remaining two chains completely cocoon around his body, causing him to tumble to the ground and writhe helplessly.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You used Ivory Chainssss out of fear of hurting your friend. How sssoft! Magesss like you will never be able to handle the power of greater ssspells.&quot; Unable to slip free from the chains, Thorin&#39;s reptilian eyes could only stare in horror as the snakeman struts to the open window of the library.<br />
<br />
    Seeing the familiar symbol of a slitted eye, Kenos&#39; face twists into a dark grin. Gently gliding his claws against the dark cover, the dark power of it&#39;s pages flow into his body, the pure bliss from the magic causing Thorin&#39;s white tome to slip from his grasp.<br />
<br />
    With his black tome in hand, the blue snakeman known as Kenos steps out from the library, his eyes shining with a purple luster.<br />
<br />
    Bemusement fills his expression, however. While the hatchling and witch were still wrapped in chains, that wasn&#39;t what grabbed his attention.<br />
<br />
    From a distance away stands a group of hooded figures, reptilian snouts protruding from the face of their black cloaks. Stepping forward, one of the figures tosses it&#39;s hood back, revealing scales pale as death, eyes red as blood.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I&#39;ve found you, Kenos.&quot;<br />
<br />
    A mad laugh resounds from the snakeman&#39;s throat. Composing himself, his purple eyes glare back at the clan of lizardmen, clashing with the red eyes of their leader.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You&#39;re terribly missstaken, <i>father;</i> it isss <i>I</i> who have found <i>you</i>.&quot;</p>
