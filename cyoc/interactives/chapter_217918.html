<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days in the hospital were hell for Jeff.<br />
Every day at set intervals he was required to have his new pussy dilated so that it could heal correctly. At first by the nurse, but eventually he was provided with a set of dilators and instructed on how to do it himself. He would never get used to the sensation of the narrow plastic implement pushing its way into his body. The mixed sensations of intense pain with an undercurrent of sexual pleasure. His body gripping and squeezing the dilator.<br />
<br />
Eventually the catheter came out and Jeff was able to go to the bathroom on his own. The short trip to the bathroom across the hall felt like a walk of shame. Jeff was all too aware of the absence between his legs and the breezy lack of coverage that the hospital gown granted. It even turned walking into a bizarre and unfamiliar experience.<br />
<br />
He cried the first time he sat down to pee, the urine streaming out from a tiny hole within his slit. It was painful both physically and emotionally at first, but since it was an unavoidable biological function he simply had to get used to it.<br />
<br />
Around night five or six (Jeff had lost count) Jeff prepared for his evening dilation. Carefully inserting the hard plastic probe into his pussy and shuddering involuntary at the electric sensations, Jeff began to wonder when he would go back to his old life. Hadn&#39;t the old man said it would be a week at most?<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and gritted his teeth as he carefully pushed the dilator deeper. His vaginal cavity squeezed it tightly and he felt a burning sensation throughout his new anatomy. Jeff let out a small yelp and opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
His new surroundings were much darker and the fluorescent lights and medical equipment were gone. He recognized this room. It was his bedroom! He looked down at the slick metallic looking object poking its way deep inside him  and he felt the overwhelming need to scream.<br />
<br />
Was this really happening?<br />
<br />
Jeff took a shaky breath. This couldn&#39;t be real. This couldn&#39;t be true. He felt as if he was going insane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, honey, dinner’s ready!&quot; Jeff heard his mother’s a voice call from somewhere downstairs. He quickly pulled the dilator out of the hole between his legs and grabbed the baggiest pair of sweat pants he owned. He didn’t know what his family knew, but if they didn’t know about the flesh wound decorating his pelvis, he didn’t want them too.<br />
<br />
He took one last glance at his bare sex before pulling the clothing over his head and stepping into the hallway. His strong masculine legs met at the swollen bruised entrance to a puffy pink cunt, it was just wrong.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stepped out into the main area of the house, he realized his father must have heard him come out of the bedroom. Jeff tried to make light of it.<br />
<br />
“So you finally decided to join us. Didn’t want to eat alone, did ya?” Jeff was still obviously spooked by his return to reality, he had to try his best to not blow his cover though. “Yeah dad, I got tired of being cooped up in my room, guess there are lots of more interesting things going on in the outside world.” Jeff attempted to inject some levity into the conversation, though he wasn’t quite sure why he needed to do so. He made his way toward the kitchen where dinner awaited.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat and ate the soup his mother had made him. In the stress of the prior situation, Jeff hadn’t put on any underwear, he wasn’t sure if his male ones would fit him anyway. Not that he cared too much. The only thing Jeff wanted right now was some peace and quiet to figure out what the hell was going on. For all he knew this whole operation could have been a dream.<br />
<br />
Little did he realize the growing red spot on his grey sweat pants. He must have aggravated his stitches somehow. He was having his first and only ever period. As soon as he finished eating, Jeff excused himself and went back upstairs. Luckily for him his parents didn’t seem to notice. It was a very close call.<br />
<br />
It took nearly fifteen minutes to untangle the dilator from his groin. Despite its appearance, there were actually many types of penis stretchers; many designed for each specific task. From almost clear plastic all the way to the very realistic models. What had started off as the hospital&#39;s decision of expediency now seemed cruel to Jeff. He examined the large veiny silicone cock that had become a twice daily occurrence. It was bigger than his was, not that it mattered now.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked to his bed and tossed it aside before getting into the shower with cold water pouring over his bruised, scabby vagina. If his body temperature was any indication, Jeff felt rather like he&#39;d been gang-raped by aliens. Every inch of his sex hurt, his mind refused to focus on anything other than what he knew he couldn’t control, blood washed down the shower drain.<br />
<br />
Jeff had seen videos of the procedure on seedy internet websites, liveleak etc. He knew exactly what had been done to his manhood. First, they had sliced down the middle of his sack and inserted a razor blade straight through his scrotum skin into the inner part of his balls, cutting the entire spermatic cord and freeing his eggs from their bag. They probably ended up in the incinerator with the rest of the now useless, discarded organs.<br />
<br />
Next, they cut away the tube of skin from around his dickhead, and slid it back to the base of his groin. His erectile tissue was next to go, leaving only the tip of his cock and what was left of his pisstube. They trimmed down his head and urethra and attached them slightly further up, this nub would be his new clit. <br />
<br />
Lastly, they sewed together and turned his dick-skin inside out and pushed it back inside his pelvis with a cotton filled condom. Most of scrotum went into the disposal too, most likely forgotten, the rest was stitched up to become his labia. The whole ordeal should have taken an hour or two, and there was no going back. <br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to scream, to shout, to yell out in frustration. But instead, he remained silent as tears streamed down his face. There was nothing he could do. Everything had happened too fast. No one had given him time to say goodbye to his body parts, or explain to his mom why he had to stay locked up in his bedroom. His human dignity had gone missing with his manhood.</p>
