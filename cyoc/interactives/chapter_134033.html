<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karyu and Oakmoss kept talking together about their lives, Karyu had to admit that by just sharing those conversations with an old friend made him feel quite happy.<br />
While Karyu was speaking with Oakmoss he remembered that Luka was waiting for him, he thought that maybe he could have his monthly meetings with Oakmoss again, but he remembered his daily routines with Luka and the crew, plus he was being crowded by his plans to erase the Cultists from existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;It felt pleasant to speak with you again Oakmoss.&quot; Started Karyu, &quot;But sadly, due to my routine exercises and constant missions i&#39;m afraid i won&#39;t be capable of seeing you again.&quot; continued Karyu, with sadness in his voice, &quot;Unless you willingly become the dragon of a Rider, then we will be capable of speaking together again.&quot; finished Karyu, trying to persuade his old friend to join him.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to hear it, but...&quot; Started Oakmoss, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Karyu, but i made an oath that i would never become the dragon of a Rider.&quot; finished Oakmoss, giving a sad look.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that in that case, it&#39;s goodbye for us both.&quot; Said Karyu, as he looked down in sadness, even as a demonic dragon, a being that is not supposed to feel emotions, he could still feel them straight in his cold heart.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, i understand.&quot; Said Oakmoss with a smile, &quot;Maybe one day, we will talk together again.&quot; continued Oakmoss, Karyu raised his head as both of them made some form of fist bump for dragons, and the two of them spreaded their wings, taking flight, without turning their heads to look at each other.<br />
<br />
Karyu returned to his and Luka&#39;s house, he instantly went towards a table where he developed possible war strategies, the demonic dragon made about forty war strategies, all of them were used both by Elisa&#39;s and Adam&#39;s kingdom, he stood there, thinking of other possible combat strategies, meanwhile his Rider, Luka, stood there giving a worried look, Anija told her about her dragon&#39;s thoughts, how he planned to erase the Cultists from existence, how he planned to then kill every single human, most of her crew begged her to attempt to stop Karyu from having those thoughts, no dragon was capable of fighting someone as strong as Karyu, suddenly, Luka remembered one of Anija&#39;s sayings, &quot;Love is the strongest medicine.&quot; it said, Luka still looked at her demonic dragon, with sadness in her eyes, she didn&#39;t know if she was capable of convincing him to stop thinking about causing Armageddon in this world.<br />
<br />
Karyu felt his Rider&#39;s cold gaze staring at him, he didn&#39;t mind it since Luka used to do this from time to time, but this gaze was diffrent, &quot;What is it my love?&quot; asked Karyu, this made Luka gulp as she slowly went towards him, sitting right infront of him, Karyu&#39;s blood red slitted eyes following her every move.<br />
Luka took a deep breath, &quot;Anija told me of your thoughts.&quot; said Luka suddenly, this made Karyu chuckle.<br />
&quot;So the little angel told you about what i&#39;m planning.&quot; Said Karyu as he read books about combat techniques, &quot;I&#39;m honestly not surprised.&quot; said Karyu as his long talons swiped the pages of the book.<br />
&quot;I mean, i understand those thoughts against the Cultists, but why would you want to do the same with humanity?&quot; Asked Luka, her voice becoming more fainter, &quot;What satisfaction will it bring you killing thousands of innocents?&quot; asked Luka again, as she looked at Karyu&#39;s red eyes.<br />
&quot;Everyone sinned, everywhere i walk, everywhere i see, everywhere i smell. I can feel it, the shattered purity, making me go mad.&quot; Said Karyu, &quot;Ending the lives will bring me momentary satisfaction, who knows, i might feel bad right after.&quot; finished Karyu with a small chuckle.<br />
&quot;No one is pure, people have made minor sins such as lying, you should be the one to take care of those who commited major sins, such as murder.&quot; Mentioned Luka, her eyes still making contact with Karyu&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Karyu chuckled again as he slowly got up, heading towards his Rider, the sound of his paws and talons clicking echoed through the room.<br />
Karyu was inches away from his Rider, lightly pressing his body against Luka&#39;s, &quot;Oh sweet Luka, why don&#39;t you let me bring Armageddon?&quot; asked Karyu as he nuzzled his Rider, &quot;Why don&#39;t you let me end the lives of those who believe themselves as deities, who command the weak?&quot; asked Karyu again, running his pink-red against Luka&#39;s neck, tasting her soft pale flesh, Luka had to admit that it did feel good, but her body didn&#39;t react at all, no shiver, no moving, nothing. &quot;Why don&#39;t you let me force civilaztions to bow and lick your pale white feet, worshiping you instead as a goddess?&quot; said Karyu.<br />
<br />
After hearing this, Luka felt her blood boil, rage filled her mind as her dragon persuaded her into letting him bring the apocalypse, only to make him and her be considered as eternal rulers, Luka&#39;s rage reached it&#39;s boiling point, and without hesitation, she slapped Karyu across the face, the slap was powerful and unexpected, making Karyu turn his head, his eyes wide and mouth open, he slowly turned his head, giving a stunned look at his Rider, he slowly raised one of his paws touching his cheek, &quot;Are you even listening to yourself?!&quot; shouted Luka, as her eyes burned with anger, &quot;Is this what my dragon has become?! A power hungry idiot?!&quot; shouted Luka again, feeling her heart beating rapidly, &quot;This isn&#39;t the dragon i know, my dragon would NEVER, think about causing people to suffer!&quot; exclaimed Luka, as she went and picked up the books from Elisa&#39;s library, &quot;Arts of war, combat and even murder?!&quot; shouted Luka, as she threw every book aside, the sound of their impacts echoing loudly throughout the room, &quot;What happend to the Karyu i knew?! What happend to &#39;Karyu the Hero Dragon&#39;?! What happend to the soft and kind drake i knew for all of these years?!&quot; kept shouting Luka, all of the shouts that left Luka&#39;s lips made Karyu slightly quiver, a demonic dragon being scared by a human, that sounded pathetic, but Luka was an exception, she was his Rider, not only did she have control over his every move, Karyu loved her and so did she, he never thought that his Rider would slap him across the face, &quot;You were there when i turned into a female, you were there to remind me that i was not myself!&quot; said Luka, her voice becoming weaker, &quot;Y-Y-You are not the dragon i knew.&quot; said Luka, as she slowly went towards Karyu, who had his eyes still wide open as he watched his Rider heading towards him, &quot;I...I...&quot; started Luka, her voice becoming completly weak, she slowly raised her hand, Karyu instinctively shutted his eyes tightly waiting for Luka to give him another slap, but, instead of feeling the sharp pain, he heard a sob, Karyu slowly opened his eyes as he looked at Luka, who was cooped up in a corner, covering her crying face with her hands, &quot;Why... Why did this happen to you?&quot; asked Luka, as she quickly looked at Karyu, her face still red with anger with tears streaming down from her eyes.<br />
<br />
Karyu felt as if a cold arrow pierced through his heart, he never saw Luka showing so much anger and sadness, the physical pain he felt when she slapped him turned into some form of spiritual pain, Karyu looked at his paws, what happend to him? Why was he like this?</p>
