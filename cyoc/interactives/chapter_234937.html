<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, do we know the location, and the origin of the outbreak site for the Rio de Janeiro Strain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the thing, Luis, we know where it started, but it&#39;s still kind of amazing it hit as hard as it did. That kid Oliveira&#39;s place, fuckin&#39; rich boy&#39;s party pad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do the symptoms look for this one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformation effect has a longer duration than most - it takes place quite slowly, and there is to a degree a certain level of mental fog or induced obliviousness - possibly due to libidinous effects. The rate of sex change in subjects seems to be around 60% sex remains the same, 40% sex changes. In some of the sex changes, the male genitalia changed alongside everything else. In others, it was the last thing to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting variations.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
If the rumors and so called hearsay about a &quot;plague&quot; and a &quot;mermaid virus&quot; bothered Gabriel Oliveira, he certainly didn&#39;t show it. The news wasn&#39;t even on in his party house. Even as his parents called and asked him to make sure he was up to date on it. He just smirked, told them that he would be sure he paid attention if it was dire...and then hanged up the phone and stood up from the deck where he sat on a beach chair, letting the sun intensify his already good tan. There was nothing that was gonna stop him from enjoying a good fucking party, and it certainly wouldn&#39;t be some mythical disease.<br />
<br />
After all, merfolk simply weren&#39;t real, after all. So how could this alleged disease even work? At least, that was the logic he operated on. Gabriel already made some calls to get a party together for the afternoon - and he knew his family was wealthy enough that any rules about such social occasions were more akin to recommendations.<br />
<br />
Stepping into his three story party house, he didn&#39;t bother putting on anything - leaving on the speedo he&#39;d worn out to both tan and show off his body on the deck. Gabriel was fond of his thick, luscious black hair, his cleanshaven, boyishly handsome face. His eyes were light brown, and he enjoyed the benefits of wealth in terms of his fitness. He swore, those new steroids he got really got his abs tight. Barely any fat left on his midsection at all! He didn&#39;t even intend to do any bodybuilding competitions - he just liked looking good for his parties. Plus, they made his shoulders and his lats so fuckin&#39; wide...<br />
<br />
A &#39;ring ring ring&#39; at his door, and Gabriel was knocked from his reverence of his own good looks. Swaggering downstairs, he opened the door to see his long time &quot;buddy&quot; Pedro and his girlfriend Adriana. <br />
<br />
Pedro wasn&#39;t quite as rich as Gabriel, and he wasn&#39;t quite as ripped, built more like a powerlifter - all thickness at the midsection, strong arms, legs and chest. Pedro likewise kept his face all shaved up, and his hair was styled back and dyed blond. Supposedly because he thought it made him look different.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s my bro doing?&quot; Gabriel walked over, welcomed Pedro in, and promptly kissed both Pedro and his girlfriend on the lips - one after the other. Each with equal intensity to the other. Gabriel preferred women, to be sure, but when a man looked good, a man looked good. And Pedro did have a certain good look.<br />
<br />
Pedro cupped Gabriel&#39;s face as he returned the kiss, and squeezed his ass as he backed up, &quot;Just glad we can still do things like this here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone always like...they always talk about fighting corruption...&quot; Adriana tapped her chin, &quot;But corruption can be uh, can be kinda fun.&quot; Pedro and Gabriel quietly and politely nodded - neither really associated with nor fucked Adriana because she was a brain trust. She was beautiful, and she had nice tits. That was her appeal to them.<br />
<br />
As Pedro took his seat in the party house, he asked, &quot;Did you call---?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I called Joao, Henrique, and Carlos, and their girlfriends. They&#39;re all coming over - and they can bring a plus one.&quot; Gabriel said with a cocky sneer - the look of a man who supposedly knew he&#39;d never face a single consequence his entire life. He took a seat opposite Pedro as he then asked, &quot;You invite the white girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Pedro grinned, &quot;Knew you&#39;d like it. Bunch of em were tourists stranded here. Young babes. Stir crazy. Eager to get moving and do something.&quot; Pedro moved one seat closer to Gabriel, and let his hand rest on his best friend&#39;s thigh, lightly feeling the tight muscles.<br />
<br />
Adriana pouted as she watched this go on, &quot;Ohh no fair, Pedro, I wanted to fuck around with Gabriel first. You know I&#39;ve been bored since the weirdo stuff started.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gabriel outright laughed, putting his hands behind his neck and lightly flexing his biceps, &quot;Now now you two, there&#39;s more than enough of me for both of you, and for any number of my guests at the party today.&quot; In fact, Gabriel could hear the sound of several more sports cars and vans parking outside - and the chatter of people walking up to his expansive home and backyard swimming pool to enjoy their time.<br />
<br />
Among them for sure were the three people Gabriel invited.<br />
<br />
Joao Carvalho was Gabriel&#39;s trainer at the gym - and his source for his steroids. Joao was 32 to Gabriel&#39;s 22, and though he was that much older, Joao tried his hardest to remain as young and vital as possible through means involving both chemicals and surgery. As far as Joao was concerned, as long as he was paid it didn&#39;t matter what happened - though the bisexual flirt did happen to throw the best parties. Joao&#39;s girlfriend walked close behind him, awkwardly shuffling. <br />
<br />
Her groin looking like it tingled...<br />
<br />
Henrique was an 18 year old &quot;understudy&quot; for Gabriel, a fawning fanboy who was always eager to bask in the playboy lifestyle of his mentor. The pale and rather bookish, nerdy guy had grown a substantial amount of muscle since working out with Gabriel, and their families had been quite close. Henrique adjusted his glasses as he walked over toward the swimming pool. He appreciated Gabriel in a lot of ways. The young man HAD got Henrique his girlfriend. So sure, Henrique supported him, talked him up, sucked his cock...nothing he didn&#39;t wanna do.<br />
<br />
And Carlos was a former school teacher who Gabriel had brought into his world of drugs and hedonism. They&#39;d met when Gabriel was in school, and the young Gabriel had for a time looked up to the muscular, older man. 38 years old, he was easily one of the older guys here, trying to disguise his declining hairline by just slicking it back. He maintained a strong, powerfully built body even then, and came with a girlfriend he met at another party he&#39;d attended.<br />
<br />
All told, many people were coming to this super spreader occasion - and it was just a matter of how the infection would spread, and who would spread it to who.</p>
