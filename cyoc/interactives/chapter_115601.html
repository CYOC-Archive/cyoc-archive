<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie pondered over what to do with Mike. The main problem is that most of the solutions she could think of involved changing Mike&#39;s mother and she wasn&#39;t sure if she could alter a person with the ring when they weren&#39;t present. She didn&#39;t want to make Mike younger and become his mother. She thought about making him older, but how old should she make him?<br />
<br />
Katie thought about making Mike into a young man and her face warmed up. She was curious what Mike would look like grown up. The other girls in the orphanage she remembered had teased her that she and Mike would be married someday. That idea had sounded silly then, but now it sounded very appealing. Katie admitted she wanted some companionship and Mike might be the best person to fill that role. Besides, it would get him out from under his uncaring mother&#39;s thumb. She rubbed the ring on her finger and said, &quot;I wish Mike was old enough to be my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike scrubbed himself in the tub. He was very grateful to the nice lady for driving those bullies away. His mom would probably have been angry if he came home dirty. He still wondered why the nice lady took her back to her very nice home and let him take a bath while she washed his clothes.<br />
<br />
The bathwater was so warm, Mike didn&#39;t notice the tingling at first. He was focused on scrubbing off the dirt that had gotten on him. He didn&#39;t notice the water slowly getting higher as his body was gaining more mass. Of course, everything was staying the same size from his perspective. It wasn&#39;t until Mike noticed the soap bar was smaller in his hand that he noticed something was different. &quot;Gee, I didn&#39;t use that much soap, did I?&quot; he asked. He paused a little at that. Did his voice sound different? Feeling a little uncomfortable, Mike shifted his legs. He looked down and suddenly noticed he was taking up a lot more space in the tub then when he had first got in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; asked Mike. His voice actually did sound different to his ears, not as high as before. He grabbed the edges of the tub and tried to push himself out, though it was a little hard to get his legs under him. When he was standing, he saw that he was looking at the bathroom from a higher perspective than before. He looks down at himself and sees that he wasn&#39;t as chubby as he was before, his round middle less noticeable on his taller body. He steps out of the tub and wraps a towel around his waist before going to the mirror. Starting back at Mike in the mirror was an older boy who looked sorta like him. He had the same black hair and hazel eyes, but his cheeks weren&#39;t as pudgy as Mike&#39;s were. Mike put a hand up to his face and felt his cheeks. His face felt less round than before, straighter and less boyish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Katie headed back up the stairs toward the bathroom. She wondered if she had given Mike enough time to fully grow. Of course, he was going to ask questions about what was going on. But Katie wasn&#39;t going to make up any stories. If Mike was going to be her husband now, he deserves to know the truth about her and the ring. She just hoped that Mike would be understanding about it. She paused a moment at the bathroom door, wondering if she should knock first. But then, Mike would try to keep her out, disguising that he was aging and prolonging this for too long. Katie didn&#39;t want to bother with the farce and just opened the door.<br />
<br />
Of course, Mike let out a yelp when she came in, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as soprano as it used to be. The boy that was clutching a towel over his waist was not the same dirt-covered boy whose clothes Katie had taken down to watch mere minutes ago. At her best guess, he was now twice the age he had been before, making him 14 and at the start of puberty. His body had grown taller and lankier, his childhood fat had melted away. It might have been hard to recognize him if he didn&#39;t still have his black hair and hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you ever heard of knocking?&quot; snapped Mike, his voice cracking as his Adam&#39;s apple started to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to be shy around me, Michael,&quot; said Katie, leaning against the door frame, cross her arms under her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-How do you know my name?&quot; asked Mike. However, his eyes weren&#39;t locked on Katie&#39;s face now, but the breasts she was lightly pushing up. As puberty progressed, he began to notice how sexy Katie was. His hormones made his eyes look up and down Katie&#39;s body in its tight sexy workout clothes. Testosterone started filling his body as it grew. His muscles were starting to become larger and more defined, his shoulders expanding wider.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she noticed that something was starting to press underneath the towel around his waist. &quot;We knew each other for years when we were both kids, Michael,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, how could we both be kids?&quot; asked Mike. His face was stretching out as his jaw started to become more defined, more chiseled. Black hairs were forming on his pecs and on his arms and legs. A treasure tail was leading from his navel, down between his hardening abs and under the towel which was getting more tented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely you haven&#39;t forgotten your old friend Katie,&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-K-Katie?&quot; asked Mike, his eyes finally locking on hers again. Confusion was evident in his face before the altered memories of the reality changes pushed aside and he remembered his childhood friend. &quot;Katie? Is it really you?&quot; he asked, &quot;How is this possible? How are you grown up and living in your own home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same way you&#39;re growing up right now,&quot; said Katie, walking towards him. He was her height by now and it still showed signs of getting taller. She held up her left hand with the ring on it. &quot;This ring gives me the power to make people younger or older and alter reality so no one would notice. If I wanted to, I could have just aged you up and you wouldn&#39;t know a difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why didn&#39;t you?&quot; asked Mike, his voice becoming a soft tenor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we were such good friends and I didn&#39;t realize how hard a life you had,&quot; said Katie, &quot;I wanted to make it up to you for leaving you behind as I grew up. And to be honest, I was feeling a little lonely and I was wondering if you consider me...&quot; At this point, she pressed against him, her breasts in her sports bra pushing against his expanding chest. &quot;...as a wife,&quot; she said in a breathy voice.<br />
<br />
Mike smiled as a deeper attraction appeared in his eyes. &quot;Well, there&#39;s one way to find out,&quot; he said before leaning in. They closed their eyes as they kissed. A simple kiss soon became a loving make-out session. Mike&#39;s hands soon clinging the towel to his waist to trace their way up Katie&#39;s body. Katie heard the sound of the towel falling to the floor and she soon felt something hard pressing into her stomach. But she didn&#39;t care by then. She was too occupied with eating Mike&#39;s face, which since it was still gaining height forced her to lean her head back to continue. She grasped his left shoulder with her left hand and the hand attached to that shoulder reached up to grasp her hand.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a feeling like a static shock between the two hands that made both Katie and Mike stop kissing. They looked at their left hands to see what caused it. The ring on Katie&#39;s finger had changed, becoming thinner, more detailed, and having a small sapphire embedded in it. A gold ring was also on Mike&#39;s ring finger, identical to Katie&#39;s ring&#39;s original shape but set with a ruby. &quot;Well, I guess that makes it official,&quot; said Mike, his voice deep and mature, &quot;We&#39;re married now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she closed her eyes for a moment as the new reality&#39;s memories caught up. Her childhood with Mike reestablished as they remained friends through elementary school, high school, and college. While Katie became an athletic competitor, Mike had gotten a more stable job as an oceanographer. But the two of them remained attached to each other and had finally tied the knot only a few months ago. But exploring the new past could wait, Katie wanted to focus on the present. &quot;And I want to see my husband&#39;s big strong body right now,&quot; she said huskily.<br />
<br />
Mike only grinned before Katie grasped his hand and lead him to her bedroom, their bedroom now. She indicated at the bed and Mike walked over to it before laying on top of it. Katie took the time to admire Mike&#39;s body. He had gone from a chubby little boy to a big muscular man. Her memories indicated that she had encouraged her boyfriend to stay in shape and it definitely showed. Instead of a pudgy body, his muscles were large and fairly sculpted, pecs, abs, biceps, triceps, and leg muscles all well-defined. There was a sexy amount of hair on his body as well, black like the hair on his head which remained the same. His face was very handsome too with a strong jaw and Roman nose that still held his familiar hazel eyes. But it was his crotch that drew Katie&#39;s attention. He had seen Mike&#39;s little package before and that was nothing compared to what he was loaded with now. His tiny balls, once indiscernible, were now both the size of golf balls and covered with a short, dense coating of black hair. His tiny, little penis had been greatly bless by puberty, growing longer than Katie could grasp in both hands. Girth-wise, Mike was a bit on the slender size, but he made up for it in both length and, as her memories were telling her, maneuverability.<br />
<br />
Katie decided she wanted to give Mike a little show. She took off her running shoes and pulled off her socks. Then she put her hands on the hem of her running shorts and tugged them down, revealing the tight panties underneath. Katie hooked her thumbs on the edges of her panties and wiggled them back and she inched them down. When they felt loose enough, she let go, letting them fall and revealing her neatly trimmed bush. She then reached and grabbed the bottom of her sports bra. She slowly pulled it upwards, revealing the curves of her lower breasts. She paused as she reach the middle point before giving a quick tug. Her breasts came loose of the cups and bounced, revealing her erect nipples. Katie pulled the sports bra over her head, allowing Mike to gaze at her glorious D-cup boobs, her toned stomach, her pleasingly wide hips, and the rest of her curvy body. Once the sports bra had fallen to the floor, Katie reached up for her last piece of clothing. She pulled off the hair tie keeping her honey-colored hair in a ponytail before tossing her head, allowing her long blonde hair to fly about.<br />
<br />
Mike was watching Katie&#39;s striptease with great interest and his penis couldn&#39;t be more erect. With that out of the way, Katie sashayed her way to the bed, let her hips sway enticingly. She climbed onto the bed and sat on Mike&#39;s legs. She grasped Mike&#39;s long rod and aimed it as she got to her knees and put herself above Mike&#39;s lap. When the head of Mike&#39;s penis was touching her, she let out a sign before going down. His penis went deep into Katie&#39;s vagina as she went.<br />
<br />
Mike groaned as Katie took his long shaft into her. While neither of them had sex before in real time, their new memories told them they were far from virgins in this new timeline. So Mike knew when to thrust his hips forward and bury the rest of him inside Katie. Katie gasped before moaning as she slid back. The two of them soon got into a rhythm of Mike thrusting and Katie sliding. Katie moaned as she felt Mike get deeper inside of her. She soon started pushing back at him, making her large breasts bounce. Mike reached up and grasped her breasts, keeping them still for a moment. He soon had Katie moaning louder as he teased her nipples before putting his lips around one.<br />
<br />
At this point, Katie was completely loss in the passion of their sex. She started bouncing harder on top of Mike, feeling the head of his penis tap on her cervix. Mike was grunting louder as Katie became more frantic. He could feel his balls tightening up, getting ready to fire. To bring Katie closer to orgasm, he started shifting underneath her, making his dick move around in Katie to rub against the walls of her tunnel. This soon brought Katie to the edge and she let out a cry as she cummed. Mike let out his own cry as his seed rocketed up his penis and deep into Katie. Right after the peak, Katie lied down on top of her husband, her bare breasts pressing his muscular chest. This was certainly a better workout than just jogging. She cupped Mike&#39;s chin before kissing him. She definitely picked the right boy to make into her man.</p>
