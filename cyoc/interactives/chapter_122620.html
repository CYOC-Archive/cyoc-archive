<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, in Nevada, Simon sat in one of the dorm rooms that Nevada&#39;s police academy provided, particularly for students that didn&#39;t reside there. In many ways it looked like what one would expect from a college dormitory, though there were some major differences. One was that if the dorm rooms were to have any decoration, they couldn&#39;t put a hole in the wall to do it. There was to be NO sexual activity on campus at all, and the dormitory&#39;s computer &quot;lab&quot; was monitored and one couldn&#39;t use it to research whatever was wanted. In some ways it was a very Spartan atmosphere, but one that was designed to keep a focus on training new officers for jobs that kept them having to work with and protect the public and keep track of an ever changing legal landscape. In this there was a LOT of things that the Nevada State Police Academy had in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man... a lot of it is rather... weird... when you&#39;re seeing a lot of anthropomorphic animals adapting so quick,&quot; said Simon&#39;s roommate as he turned from his chair at a set desk and a lap top that he had set up. The academy did allow the use of private and personal computers for any purpose, but there was still some things like curfews that needed to be followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird?&quot; Simon asked slowly and with a low growl edging in his voice.<br />
<br />
The IAC had been a success, even with the occasional surprises, but Simon was also well aware that the present government at the National Level was not a true friend of Animalia. The present administration hadn&#39;t tried to outright take away Animalian&#39;s civil rights, but it had been fairly clear that there were attempted bullying tactics to either force Animalians into the military, restrict voting rights for Animalians and particularly humans that had became Animalians, create a national age of consent (regarding sex) to 21, and various other restriction efforts, largely under the claim of being tough on crime, supporting morality, and preventing voter fraud. But the efforts in terms of either Executive Orders or attempted laws in Congress, it was clear that the measures were intended to be so draconian in nature that Animalia would be left in a sort of legal limbo where their success and survival would only be limited to as long as Horizon or individual states supported them financially...<br />
<br />
So far these efforts had failed, either through legal challenges made that had gone before Federal courts that had turned down the Executive Orders or from the fact that Congress had proved to be so dysfunctional that nothing really got through it. That didn&#39;t stop those who were supportive of the present administration from voicing their opinion loudly, and often trying to make it seem that the administration&#39;s efforts were beneficial to Animalia. Nevada had been among those more opposed to these decisions, but that didn&#39;t mean that every person in the state was critical of the largely feeble attempts to strip Animalians of their rights under the law and the Constitution.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... a little over a year ago, humanity was the ONLY sentient and sapient species on Earth, and now we have to share,&quot; his roommate commented as he looked over to Simon, &quot;that is by its very definition... weird... not that weird is necessarily bad. In some cases, weird can be good. And the Animalia ambassador show is one way to do that... make weird good and showing all the good things Animalia does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon relaxed a little at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;If fact... it might eventually lead to what&#39;s weird today eventually becoming the new normal,&quot; his roommate commented, &quot;especially as you all serve to do better and better... I mean didn&#39;t you help catch a whole bunch of drug smugglers by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About all I did was detect that drugs were involved,&quot; Simon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And made the news, right?&quot; his roommate quipped, &quot;how did that go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon managed a small shrug there. A lot of his training and enrolment had been mixed between what would be considered a normal enrollment with the academy and a sort of special apprenticeship that related to the fact that as a wolf Animalian he also had special lessens that related to what many of the Animalia PD and uplifted canine unites for the Lyre PD units had gone through. In some ways it had been easy, as those who been canine units before were able to describe what drugs smelled like and Simon hadn&#39;t had to go through the full level of &quot;training&quot; that a normal canine unit had to go through. It had helped and been great and had actually made his apprenticeship easier and made for the drug bust even easier and had lead to drug bust to go even easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Simon spoke and then paused to explain the interview to his roommate.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
... The interview had been set up to cover Simon had found, mostly in relation to the drug bust during the IAC. The bust had been a surprise as no one had expected anyone to try and drug anyone at the IAC. But someone had and gone after some of the humans that had been part of the show and events. The fact that Simon had been in training when it was discovered was something that seemed to lead to a lot of positive press, which Simon figured would help Animalia win support, given that this discovery allowed Animalia to show that Animalians were not drug addicts or anything like that. That they would work to catch and arrest those that would try to use them for drug smuggling would help, as far as Simon had thought Animalians helping fight the &quot;war on drugs&quot; would go a long way.<br />
<br />
And it did go a long way. The Animalia PD was quick to try and win attention and that included their &quot;airborne&quot; officers, eagles and falcons who soared the skies to monitor speeders and wildlife protection for many of the mundane animals that weren&#39;t uplifted to make sure that they stayed safe. They also served for any &quot;pursuit or trailing criminals that tried to smuggle things through Animalia, though the one that won the greatest praise in THAT regard was either a Turkey Vulture or a California Condor, Simon wasn&#39;t fully sure which, for being not only able to sore like the uplifted Golden and Bald Eagles, but also being those that many tended to ignore for various reasons. Simon, before his interview had managed to thank the APD officer who had helped with that racking mission personally.<br />
<br />
Then came when an ABC reporter came to talk directly to Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now we speak with the great hero of the recent drug bust, Simon Truman,&quot; the reporter spoke with a small smile and held the microphone to Simon, which to him looked like a glorified drumstick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Simon,&quot; Simon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or Officer Truman,&quot; the reporter smiled, &quot;as you WERE the officer that found out that the model had been drugged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only caught the scent, but I&#39;m sure the officer I&#39;ve been apprenticed to at the moment would have found that out as well,&quot; Simon said politely, &quot;I really didn&#39;t do anything heroic...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say apprentices...?&quot; the reporter paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon nodded, &quot;You see, because I am an Animalian, the Nevada Police Academy is providing much the same training and apprenticeships that they&#39;ve provided for the uplifted wolves and dogs that were either A) part of the Lyre Police Department before their uplifting or B) volunteered to enforce the law. This has included personal training so I can identify various drugs by scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So earlier drug dogs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That have been uplifted help provide all of us with information on what certain drugs smell like while human officers provide person to person tips on things that smugglers have tried to smuggle drugs in,&quot; Simon explained, &quot;sort of a modified version of how the police would train mundane dogs. It helps all of us learn them quickly and even provides some &quot;on the job training&quot; for regular officers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you make the actual arrest? Or?&quot; the reporter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I did was detect that the drugs were present, as per the training that I&#39;ve received so far over the summer,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;The actual arrest went to those who have been fully trained and have their badges.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But so far the reports on this drug bust have gone to show how well Animalians can function, not just in Human Society, but in protecting it,&quot; the reporter commented, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you think what you&#39;ve done and provided is worth more that what you&#39;ve said?&quot;<br />
<br />
If Simon could blush through his fur in embarrassment, he would have. Being an Animalian was to cure his diabetes as part of Project Phoenix, and that had worked out spectacularly well. His desire to be a policeman was to honor his uncle who&#39;d been killed in the line of duty when a drier hit black ice and lost control of the vehicle and hit Simon&#39;s uncle by accident.<br />
<br />
&quot;It represents the good that ANY Animalian can do, and not just myself,&quot; Simon spoke, &quot;and where, if allowed to truly thrive and function, Animalia could help make everything better... if we&#39;re allowed to be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, young, Simon Truman,&quot; the reporter said again with a smile, &quot;With all that you&#39;ve done and done to help save lives as a result of discovering those drugs... I&#39;d say that you&#39;ve done A LOT that would move things forward and show everyone the good that Animalians can do. And one would have pretty stupid NOT to notice it.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s pretty much how the interview went,&quot; Simon finished as he looked to his roommate, who despite the comment of things related to Animalia being &quot;weird&quot; actually looked to Simon with a rather polite smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... figuring out what had happened and drawing attention DID help,&quot; his roommate commented, &quot;and that is part of what the instructors here have been talking about in the classes on the law and how to enforce it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon shrugged at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that, is where you&#39;ll have your best shot at good publicity,&quot; his roommate continued, &quot;Show the good that you HAVE done and a lot of all these negative blowhards lookin&#39; for the &quot;Good ol&#39; days&quot; wont have much of a platform to stand on.&quot;</p>
