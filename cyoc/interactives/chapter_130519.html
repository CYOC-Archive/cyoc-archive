<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I arrived back at Rod’s he met me at the door “How did you go?” he asked.<br />
“We had an easy win” I replied. “I don’t think I made a fool of myself”<br />
“I was going to see if I could find a movie on Netflix. Care to join me?” I could see the TV was already on.<br />
“That sounds like a good idea. I’ll join you after a shower” <br />
I went to my room, put down my bag and contemplated my next move. I had decided that I did want to have sex with Rod, but was still very nervous with the prospect. Watching a movie with him was a good idea, it might be a good way to calm my nerves and I could take things as fast or as slow as I wanted. I pushed the door shut as I contemplated what I might wear. Should I put on a dress as if we were going on a date? Or should I put on some nightwear as if we were lovers at home together? Maybe that was a bit too forward and it would be really embarrassing if Rod no longer felt attracted to me. After all I was really his best mate Zach, even if I was currently inhabiting his fiance Sarah’s body.<br />
I decided on wearing a dress. Sarah had a lot of dresses and most of them were in the wardrobe in front of me. I selected what could be described as a “Little black dress” and held it in front of myself in front of the mirror. Probably a bit too sexy I thought and returned it. I eventually selected a navy knee length dress that had t-shirt length sleeves and a modest neckline. It zipped up at the back and felt silky to touch. Knowing what I liked when I had testicles, I also delved into the underwear drawer and selected a satin bra and panty set as well as a camisole and slip. For good measure I added a pair of skin tone panty hose. I put everything into a bag so that Rod could not see what I had collected and casually walked to the bathroom. I noticed Rod was on the couch watching the TV.<br />
I locked the bathroom door and took off the netball uniform I had been wearing. There were a few spots on my pad but essentially the menstrual flow had stopped. I jumped in the shower and gave myself a good scrub. My long hair felt sweaty so I decided another wash of it could do no harm. I knew the drier was still in the bathroom from this morning.<br />
When finished I towelled myself dry then started getting dressed. The panties went on first and for the first time since Sunday morning I did not add a pad, not wanting to spoil the effect. I was really turned on as I watched a sexy woman in the mirror dressing. Once the underwear was on, I used the hair drier and styled my hair. I even applied some lipstick. I stepped into the dress and after a little struggle was able to pull the zip to the top. I took one last glance in the mirror. As ‘Zach’ I would have loved to date the woman I saw. On the outside I looked like a stylish businesswoman. Rod would get a pleasant surprise if he delved underneath.<br />
Ok I told myself. You are ready and willing. Act casual and go and sit on the far end of the couch. <br />
I walked past Rod and did exactly that. His eyes were all over me as I passed. “Did you find anything of interest on Netflix” I asked as I sat down. I couldn’t help but think we had often sat down together like this in these same seats to play videogames. <br />
“Well believe it or not I have only ever seen the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies” I’d like to watch number 3”<br />
I had seen the movie but not as a female “Sure, Sounds good”<br />
Rod used the remote to load the movie but paused it as the opening credits started. “I’ll just go get something to snack on. Would you like a drink while I’m up? Maybe a Bailey’s?”<br />
“That would be nice”<br />
“Come on Biddy, you can go out the back while I am up”<br />
Rod put Biddy out then came back with a block of chocolate that he placed on a coffee table by the couch. He then poured two glasses of liqueur gave one to me and placed the bottle beside the chocolate. He walked over to the light switch and dimmed them, then sat down, however this time he chose the middle seat of the 3 seater sofa. He restarted the movie.<br />
I can’t say I was paying much attention to what was on the screen, I was surreptitiously watching Rod. I sipped on my drink. After 5 minutes I asked quietly “Could you pass a chocolate?”<br />
Rod broke off a couple of pieces and passed them to me. I edged ever so closer to him.<br />
I few minutes later, Rod saw that my glass was nearly empty he said “Let me give you a refill” He leaned over to the table and refilled both glasses and passed mine back. I noticed that when he resumed watching the movie our shoulders were gently touching.<br />
His left hand brushed against my thigh. I transferred my drink to my left hand and let my right hand find his hand, I gave it a gentle squeeze.<br />
I could feel my body heating up. I lifted his hand and placed it on top of my thigh. I whispered “My glass is empty, I don’t want anymore, could you put it on the table” he put his own glass down then reached across with his right hand and took my glass. All the time I held his left hand against my lap.<br />
I released his hand and moved my hand on to his thigh. I leaned in closer to him and rested my head on his shoulder. We stayed like this for several minutes. <br />
I moved forward slightly creating a slight gap that gave Rod the chance to move his left arm around my shoulders and envelop me in a cuddle. I pressed myself tightly against him savoring his manly smell. He must have taken a shower while I was at netball.<br />
With my left arm I reached across and found his right hand. I pulled it back and placed it on my thigh above my knee. His fingers caressed my leg, playing with the material of my dress. I could feel the silky layers of clothing rub against each other. I snuggled closer.<br />
Rod’s hand slowly drifted up and across very gently me through the clothing, it crossing to my left leg, then across my hips, it followed the contours of my body past my waist and came to cup my left breast. After a minute the hand rose further, up to my neck, he gently manoeuvred my chin so that we were looking at each other. Then he kissed me.<br />
We held the kiss for several minutes, his hand went back to my breasts. I could feel my nipples trying to push through the fabric as his fingers circled them.<br />
“Turn off the TV and let’s resume in the bedroom” I whispered when the kiss finally stopped. <br />
Rod’s response was another long kiss. <br />
We finally extricated ourselves and Rod turned off the TV and led me by the hand to his bedroom. <br />
Once in there I took command. I told him to leave the main light off but to turn on a bedside lamp. I then had him stand still while I unbuttoned his shirt and removed it. I caressed his bare chest, then pulled his head down for another long kiss. <br />
I pulled away and asked him to undress me. He walked behind me and slowly pulled down the zip. The dress fell to the floor. I stepped out of it and as gracefully as I could, picked it up and placed over a chair. Rod caressed me through the camisole before I indicated for him to stop. I indicated he was to stay still and as elegantly as I could I sat on the bed and took off the pantyhose I had been wearing. Now clad in Sarah’s camisole and slip I asked Rod to strip down to his boxers. He did so.<br />
When he was finished I made him stand in the middle of the room. He was very much standing to attention. I walked around him, letting my hands wander across his chest and fondle his bum. <br />
I indicated what I was wearing “I think this camisole needs to go, don’t you?” and bade him to undress me further. He gently lifted it over my head revealing the silky light blue bra I was wearing. <br />
I then indicated the slip I was still wearing, he pushed it over my hips and I stepped out, this time revealing matching light blue panties. <br />
I thought you could not get pregnant during a period but I was not going to take any risks. <br />
“Condom?“ I asked. He reached down and found one in his bedside drawer. As he did so I slipped into the bed. I watched as he removed his boxers and put on the protection. <br />
He joined me without another word and before long my bra and panties were discarded. I was overwhelmed with desire as he entered me. He knew what this body liked and before long I was shuddering in orgasm. My involuntary moans prompted Rod to climax himself. <br />
<br />
We stayed cuddling for 10 minutes before Rod got up, went to the en suite and cleaned himself up. While he was in there I found my panties, went to the other bathroom, cleaned my teeth, relieved myself and inserted a pad. I went to the spare bedroom, found and put on the nightie I had worn the previous night but decided to return to Rod’s bed. He was fast asleep. I snuggled against him and was soon asleep myself.</p>
