<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;That can&#39;t be right?&#39; Kyle thought to him self as he finished reading the instructions.<br />
<br />
The instructions looked like they were translated poorly from some other language, which was probably true.<br />
<br />
He read over them again to be sure, just as confused as before, but interested in getting something simple for a first toy, having looked at the beads and even played with the colour changing gem at the end, he didn&#39;t notice anything that might suggest anything magical.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe they are a novelty toy from some fantasy story?&#39; he wondered to himself, in any event he thought they were enough for his first time buying something like this.<br />
<br />
Kyle shrugged and took the box to the counter, quickly turning red with embarrassment as the older woman behind the counter smiled at him, &quot;Ah, good choice child, a good starter toy, so long as you follow the instructions!&quot; She warned him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, I...I will,&quot; He stammered out. &quot;How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well usually this item would be $80, but for you, for your first purchase, special price! $40!&quot; She grinned.<br />
<br />
&#39;How did she know this is my first?&#39; Kyle asked himself, &quot;Uh thanks...&quot; He said as he handed her the cash, which she happily took.<br />
<br />
The woman placed the box into a plain brown paper bag and handed it back to Kyle, &quot;Thank you for your patronage!&quot; She smiled back as he akwardly took the bag from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, thanks.&quot; Kyle replied as he left with his purchase.<br />
----------------<br />
Kyle got in his car and made his way home, when he got there he quietly made his way to his room, his Dad and older brothers were home but doing their own stuff so he was able to get to his room unnoticed.<br />
<br />
Once there he quickly locked his door, he knew he would have a few hours before they asked where he was or checked his room.<br />
<br />
Next he stripped his clothes off and laid naked on his bed, he was eager to try his new toy but also afraid of it, this was all new to him.<br />
<br />
He looked over the instructions again making sure he understood, blue gem meant inactive and safe to insert/remove, red gem meant active, he switched the gem to red while holding the beads and nothing happened, &quot;Maybe it doesn&#39;t do anything until it&#39;s inserted?&quot; Kyle asked quietly as he held the beads.<br />
<br />
He waited a minute or two with the gem red for something to happen but nothing did so he switched it back to blue.<br />
<br />
Kyle shrugged his narrow shoulders before he looked for his lube, &quot;Oh crap!&quot; he swore as he realised he didn&#39;t have any.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well!&quot; He said as he brought the beads to his mouth, sticking his tongue out to get them all slicked up, while he was slobbering all over the first couple beads he wondered what they would be like all in his mouth, maybe he could deepthroat them?<br />
<br />
Without thinking much more about it, Kyle started feeding the small string of beads into his mouth, actually enjoying the feel of the round, rubbery orbs rolling on his tongue only when he wrapped his lips around the plug at the end did he realise he had them all in his mouth, though not quite deep enough to be considering deepthroating, they were tickling the back of his throat making him gag a little.<br />
<br />
While he gagged on the beads and not wanting to be too loud he brushed the gem at the base with his hand, flicking it to red.<br />
<br />
Within a few seconds his gagging stopped, and quickly his throat started actually feeling very comfortable.<br />
<br />
Not sure why and still not aware that the gem was red, Kyle started pulling the beads out of his mouth. After the first few came out he was confused he could see how much he had taked out of his mouth, but his mouth still felt comfortably full, it was only after he pulled more out that he realised that they were getting bigger!<br />
<br />
Turning to look at his bedside mirror, Kyle saw the red gem! &#39;Magic!&#39; he thought.<br />
<br />
Looking at his mirror he could see the entire string of beads out of his mouth, the base bead with the gem and the five beads before it, but there was now a string continuing between his lips! <br />
<br />
Kyle pulled the base watching with curiosity and bewilderment as consistantly larger bead after bead popped out from between his lips, the fifth bead originally being about an inch in diameter, after that one they looked to be doubling in size with each that followed.<br />
<br />
As he pulled bead after bead from his mouth he could feel what the instructions said, resistance, no pain or discomfort, just a slight hesitation before he could pull the next bead out.<br />
<br />
At five more beads the tenth was larger than anything Kyle could have imagined coming out of his mouth, easily he estimated at the size they were getting larger, ten inches in diameter!<br />
<br />
Kyle pushed the beads back into his mouth, each one easily popping back into his gaping mouth until all that was left was the base and the gem between his lips.<br />
<br />
He flicked the gem again and waited. Counting about thirty seconds before he felt all the beads retract, it was an odd feeling, he could feel them all slide effortlessly back into his mouth and down his throat as he pushed them in, then as they retracted he could feel them slide up into his mouth then they were gone leaving only the original beads.<br />
<br />
With the gem blue Kyle pulled the beads from his mouth, his mouth and face feeling the same as they had before.</p>
