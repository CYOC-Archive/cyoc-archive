<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Organata just laughed. She laughed for a solid minute straight as Steve held Megan&#39;s hand tightly, prepared to run if things went south. She finally stopped laughing and gave the two a warm smile. She waved her arms as a bright glow emitted from her hands. The world around them faded away and in the blink of an eye Steve and Megan found themselves back at the old creepy house. They looked to their right toes that Alan and Janet had also been brought there, though they looked very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve?&quot; Janet asked upon seeing her husband. &quot;Why are we back here? Who&#39;s that?&quot; She asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not be afraid my child, I brought you here to rectify my magic.&quot; Organata replied as she waved her arms once more and the book appeared in her hands. <br />
<br />
The family back towards one another as she flipped through the book. Light began to strongly emit from it once more as the family was blinded by the book. Steve braced yet again. He stumbled backwards and ended up falling on his ass, He yelled in pain, but the pain in his butt was quickly ignored and replaced by happiness as Steve had heard his scream. It was the scream of a man.<br />
<br />
His eyes cleared and he looked down to see that not only was he a grown man once again, but he was wearing his old clothes too! He pulled out his wallet just to check and he nearly jumped for joy. It read &quot;Steve Donaldson&quot; and it said male with his own picture back in its place. He got up and saw his family checking themselves and all of them were smiling or chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey!&quot; Janet yelled almost in tears as she hugged Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a girl again!&quot; Megan gleefully screamed as Alan sighed in relief while checking his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Organata.&quot; Steve apologized. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t have entered this place, but thank you for fixing this mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s quite all right dear! Besides, if you didn&#39;t, I would have been trapped outside of time forever.&quot; She laughed. &quot;But, I still feel I owe you some compensation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really it&#39;s f-&quot; Steve began before she waved her arms once more. Suddenly, four orbs of light appeared in front of each of the Donaldsons. They began to shape and form until four brand new objects appeared. In front of Steve was a nice looking wristwatch, in front of Janet was a bracelet with multiple bead like designs on it, in front of Megan was a hand mirror, and in front of Alan was a small notebook. They all looked at each other in confusion before looking towards a smiling Organata.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your compensation.&quot; She began. &quot;Each of you were forcibly altered as reality changed against your will, so now, you will have your own individual abilities to change reality yourselves. Steve, you watch allows you to alter your, or anyone else&#39;s, age, physical, mental or both. If you switch settings, you can also use it to change things like gender, object animal, or whatever. Janet, your bracelet will let you do similar changes to Steve&#39;s. I figure the parents should be similar. You can change anyone or anything into something slightly different. If you hit the gender symbol, for example, you&#39;ll turn into a male version of yourself, or if you hit the pet symbol, maybe a dog or a cat or the age symbol... oh you get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan, your mirror will let you change your, or anyone else&#39;s, life. You could change someone&#39;s job, or make yourself head cheerleader, or change someone&#39;s romantic interest, or anything else your heart desires. And Alan, you notebook will let you write anything in it and have it happen. Maybe you have a crush on a girl you&#39;d like the courage to meet or want to win the lottery, your choice really. If the pages run out, the book will grow so no worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
The family was speechless as they all griped their magical artifacts tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Reality will alter along with any changes you make.&quot; Organata continued. &quot;You four will be the only ones aware of course, so be careful.&quot; She half joked. &quot;Oh and don&#39;t worry about learning how to use it or loosing it. You&#39;ll know exactly how it works, and only you can use your object unless you give someone permission.&quot; She waved goodbye, moved her arms once more, and suddenly the Donaldson&#39;s found themselves back home. All of them were speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe that just happened.&quot; Alan finally mustered as he gripped the notebook tightly. &quot;I can do anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on.&quot; Janet chimed in. &quot;It was nice of her to change us back, but we don&#39;t want to mess our lives up again. Right Steve?&quot; She asked, only to be surprised when no-one responded. &quot;Steve?&quot; She asked again as she turned around to see her husband fiddling with his new watch. &quot;Steve!&quot; She shouted as he began to change.<br />
<br />
His beer bellied deflated as his height slightly increased. His blond hair that had been balding quickly sprouted back as his wrinkles faded away. His suit that he was wearing morphed into a flannel and a pair of jeans as his age regressed even further. He finally stopped changing as the family stood in awe at Steve who was now no older than 19 years old. He ran over to a mirror and started laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap!&quot; He yelled. &quot;I&#39;m young again!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Steve. What was I just saying?&quot; Janet continued before a shimmer sound went off behind her. <br />
<br />
Janet turned to see the mirror glowing and Megan shifting slightly. He acne vanished in an instant as her hair grew longer and more styled into curls. Her figure matured slightly as her dorkier clothes transformed into that of a cheerleading uniform. She looked back in the mirror and started laughing with joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;O.M.G.&quot; She gawked. &quot;Mom, I&#39;m one of the popular girls now!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot believe you two!&quot; She yelled. &quot;What if that woman was lying? What if these things mess with your minds?! You can&#39;t just... Alan where are you going?&quot; She asked as she saw her son putting on his jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom...&quot; He explained as he held up the book. &quot;But I have a date with freaking Melissa Brown!&quot; He laughed. &quot;See ya later I&#39;m going on a date!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you are not!&quot; She yelled as she started to get angry. She clutched he bracelet, and as if it were second nature to her, selected what she wanted to change Alan into. He stopped in place as his body shook. His blond, shaggy hair began to lengthen and then sprout up across his body. His clothes vanished as his hair grew out everywhere. He fell onto his front legs as his face elongated and a tail sprouted from his behind. A collar appeared on him that read &quot;Alana&quot; as he finished turning into a yellow lab.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bark Bark BARK!&quot; He barked angrily as he started awkwardly swiping at his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit Janet!&quot; Steve said shocked. &quot;You turned our son into a dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just a dog, a bitch!&quot; Megan pointed out, trying not to die of laughter. Alan barked back and then made a whining noise at his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh I&#39;m so sorry Alan! Just none of you were listening and I didn&#39;t want anyone to leave so I panicked and... Okay honey don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll change you back.&quot; She rambled, but just before she changed him back she felt a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey wait a sec.&quot; Steve said. &quot;Look at this.&quot; <br />
<br />
The family gathered around and stared dumbfounded at the photo Steve now held up. It was a family photo they had taken last year in the backyard. They could tell since it was definitely the same location and Janet looked the same, but the rest of the family was different now. Janet held her arm on the shoulder of the young Steve, and a more confident Megan stood with a model pose while pretending to kiss the dog that had been Alan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Organata wasn&#39;t kidding.&quot; Megan gasped. &quot;We have complete control over reality. To the world, I&#39;ve always been popular, Dad&#39;s always been my older brother, and Alan&#39;s a girl dog!&quot; She laughed.</p>
