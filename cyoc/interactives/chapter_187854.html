<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, that machine can swap or change just about anything right?&quot; asked Ashley. Jeff nodded and answered. &quot;Yeah, I suppose so. Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was just thinking. Have you ever wanted to be a girl before? Well, I guess, would you want to is a better question. And more specifically, would you want to be me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sat up. &quot;Ok, I am going to need more information. What are you asking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what if we traded bodies? But you keep the pussy and I keep my penis of course. And our lives will remain the exact same too. Only our bodies will be different, and I guess our names could be swapped too, if you want. So you would be Ashley, but have your normal life still, and I would be Jeff&quot; summarized Ashley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know... what about our families?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will stay as is, and they will just think nothing is wrong at all. And I want to still be thought of as a girl, even if I have the body of a man. So you would have my body, but still be thought of and treated as a guy by everyone else. Oh, and this is just a curiosity of mine. So I only ask you to do this for just the rest of today too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff contemplates her offer. It does sound oddly tempting and since it would also be temporary, there was little downside to it too. And it isn&#39;t like he would be required to be her, just swap their bodies and names is all. &quot;I guess that would be ok with me. But are you ok with me having your body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely, or I would not have asked you in the first place&quot; smiled Ashley. So Jeff went ahead and did the swap. He made sure that only their names and bodies, save for their specific crotches, were swapped. After everything was said and done, Jeff, now Ashley held her breasts in her hands, feeling their actual weight for the first time. She now understood that they were not nearly as lightweight as she had thought. Thought to be fair, Ashley never had been considered flat chested in the first place either, and by a significant margin too. Her hair also was quite heavy, but both it and the boobs were quite beautiful, even if it now was hers to show off, instead of view and appreciate.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Ashley, now Jeff, was amazed at how strong he felt. Having a male body, especially Jeff&#39;s, was really making him happy. He had never felt so full of energy, even when they had just had sex. He felt so much better balance too without the boobs and the long hair weighing him down. He had to admit, he could get use to this. But the biggest surprise came when he looked over at Ashley, and immediately felt his penis harden. He wanted her so badly right now. Thoughts of forcing himself on her, even though she would almost certainly allow it, raced into his mind for just a split second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, do you feel like this all the time? I never would act on it without your permission, but I just have this urge to fuck you so much right now&quot; asked Jeff in disbelief. Ashley blushed a bit after hearing that he wished to still fuck her even more than they just did, and her own body now was reacting to her growing eagerness to just pounce on him. She wanted nothing more than to shove his penis deep inside of her, or even suck on it as much as possible. A thought that she never expected to be so tempting. <br />
<br />
But she managed to smile it off, and replied. &quot;Yes, it is normal to an extent. I truly do love you, so that may also be a factor too. Oh, and please do not hold back. I am more than willing to satisfy your lust at any time. Be it by using my pussy, or boobs, or... mouth.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, mouth? As in... you want to suck on my penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley nodded excitedly. &quot;Yes, I would love to actually. Though I never have given, or experienced a blowjob before, I feel as if I can still do it well enough for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure. I mean, I am not going to stop you, you know. If you want to, then please suck it.&quot; Ashley smiled cheerfully and happily got on top of Jeff, who was given a prime view of her still drooling pussy as it now was right in front of his face. Meanwhile, Ashley reached and grabbed the penis head in her hands, then stuffed it into her mouth a bit. It felt off though, so she spat it out and tried licking it as if it were an ice cream cone. This worked out a bit better, but in the end it was the penis itself who guided her through the entire process until it shot it&#39;s load right down her throat. She coughed a bit, but licked her lips clean seductively, making sure to clean off every finger slowly and one at a time, while making sure Jeff was watching. &quot;So, how was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it is like you are meant to be my girlfriend. You are a really good cock sucker. And you would make for a really good woman too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thank you, but I was just doing what your amazing penis showed me is all. I could definitily do a better job at it~ waaaH! Hey mmmmm! W-what are you... heuuuhhh! MMmmpppfff! Ahh Haa ahhhaa haahaaa! Up a bit! No, go deeper! Yeah, right there! Uhhhhh, MMMMMHMMMMHMMmmm!!!!!!!!&quot; Ashley moaned like a bitch in heat as she squirted all over Jeff&#39;s face, who had been eating her out just moments before. And he still kept at it afterwards. Forcing her to squirt several more times until he was satisfied and she was exhausted once again. <br />
<br />
The two of them had done nothing but pleasuring each other relentlessly for the better half of the morning. The whole time, neither had noticed how Jeff&#39;s penis had slowly but surely wrapped the two of them together, securing Ashley to Jeff upside down. She would not be able to free herself unless Jeff either let his penis free themselves, or do it manually. It was then that someone called for Ashley. <br />
<br />
It was her Mom, or rather, Jeff&#39;s mom, since only her name and body are different than usual. Her Mom still considered her to be her son, only now named Ashley. She was also habitually careless and never could read the room. So she just walked to Ashley&#39;s room and entered it without even a moment of hesitation. &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know you had someone over. Sorry to interrupt but can you please grab some food for yourself tonight? I have a dinner party with my friends, so I won&#39;t be home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, seriously? Now is not the time. Please leave!&quot; demanded Ashley, who now was completely embarrassed. &quot;I just wanted to let you know. By the way who is your friend here?&quot; Said Ashley&#39;s mother with no apparent sense of urgency to leave the room. &quot;Ugggghhhh! Mom, this is Ashl-er, Jeff. She is my boyfriend?&quot; &quot;Hello, I am Jeff, your son&#39;s girlfriend. We started going out just recently&quot; quickly said Jeff, hoping to bail out Ashley from her floundering. Ashley&#39;s mom nodded and smiled. Well, take care of my son, he can be quite meticulous, especially when it comes to his vaginal hygiene. He always gets a full-on Brazilian wax too, so at least it is good to know someone is now able to appreciate all his efforts.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Leave!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok. Oh, we have a few condoms in the medicine cabinet if you need anymore, so please don&#39;t hesitate to use them if you need more. Have fun, and it is a pleasure to meet you Jeff. You seem like a very nice, and a quite well hung, girl. I can see why my son likes you.&quot; With that, Ashley&#39;s mom leaves the room and continues about her day. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry about her. She is completely hopeless when it comes to reading the room.&quot; Apologized Ashley while she hid her head in Jeff&#39;s crotch out of embarrassment. Jeff just awkwardly laughed it off though, and began caressing Ashley&#39;s ass that still was in his face. &quot;Its fine, she seems like a nice lady.&quot;</p>
