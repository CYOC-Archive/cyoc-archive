<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlene led Noah down to the nurse's office, clearing enjoying the view of Noah as they went, and as they <br />
walked she idly talked to him about how things were and other such platitudes, clearly flirting with this new <br />
hunk of a man. Noah didn't notice any of her advances, and only barely responded to her questions; he was too <br />
busy wondering what the hell had happened to him. His head seemed foggy, likely due to the massive blow he <br />
took to the head, but still something seemed off. He hadn't always been 7'2&quot; had he? It was impossible that he <br />
hadn't though, people don't just grow, and his clothes still fit. He must have just forgotten how tall he was <br />
and banged his head, and that's why everything seems so weird. Or maybe not?<br />
<br />
Noah's brain was still going back and forth on the topic when the got to the nurse's office. He let out a sigh <br />
of relief, at least she'll be able to tell him what's wrong with his body. &quot;Gosh, I really hope I don't have a <br />
concussion.&quot; He thought tiredly as they walked into the nurse's office. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you sit right here while I go get the nurse. Then maybe we can get you a physical done,&quot; Charlene <br />
told Noah as she led him to a seat, her tone soothing. Then, as an addendum, she said in a considerably more <br />
flirtatious tone, &quot;And who knows, maybe I can help.&quot; Noah just said, still oblivious, &quot;Oh yes, thank you, I'd <br />
appreciate that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene rolled her eyes and sighed as she walked deeper into the office, looking for that slut of a nurse. <br />
What she found instead was a sign reading, &quot;Out for lunch be back... sometime.&quot; Charlene sighed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like Nurse Natalie is still out for lunch, Noah.&quot; Charlene informed him when she had turn <br />
around and walked back to his chair. &quot;Oh, well, that's okay, I'll wait here. You can go to class, I think <br />
lunch is almost over by now.&quot; Noah informed her good-naturedly, &quot;Thanks for bringing me down here though.&quot; <br />
Charlene wasn't going to put up with that, she wanted in this knucklehead's pants, and now! &quot;Well, Noah, I <br />
thought maybe I could sit with you and make sure you're okay? I'm very good at making men feel good, if you're <br />
hurting.&quot; That last line was so heavy-handed and obviously a bad come-on, Noah would have to be a buffoon to <br />
miss it. &quot;Oh no, that's okay, I have my book to read, and I don't want to make you late for class,&quot; Noah was <br />
still smiling that stupid, completely clueless smile....<br />
<br />
But he did have a point, surprisingly. Charlene bit her lip, if she's late to Geometry one more time she's in <br />
danger of being kicked off the cheer squad....<br />
&quot;Fine. Well, Noah, I hope you feel better,&quot; Charlene said, in her best seductress voice, &quot;And I hope to see <br />
you around a lot more in the future.&quot; She leaned forward and gave the hairy, masculine man a peck on the <br />
cheek, and ran out the door. <br />
<br />
Noah was mortified. Why did she kiss him!? Is that how girls usually say goodbye!? He didn't have a lot of <br />
experience with women, so he really didn't know. But his mom would always give him a kiss when he hurt himself <br />
when he was young, so maybe Charlene was just saying &quot;fell well soon&quot;? <br />
This seemed plausible enough for Noah, at least more so than the alternative that she was attracted to him. <br />
Either way, he dismissed the thought and picked up his book, eager to start reading.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, just outside the nurse's office, Ty watched the scene unfold. He laughed when Charlene came huffing <br />
and puffing out of the office, Noah certainly was a heart-breaker. He smirked as he saw Noah pick up his book <br />
once more through the window. He giggled deviously, this one is certainly going to be fun.<br />
<br />
Noah had, unfortunately, lost his page when he bashed his head. He opened to a page, and found himself right <br />
where he had started at lunch, oh yeah, he was somewhere right about here. He scanned through the pages, <br />
flipping quickly over them. The second he flipped that first page everything grew. His body inched up just a <br />
bit, to 7'3&quot;, his feet expanded to size 26, his shoulders broadened, his muscles bulged out, and his cock <br />
snaked down another inch to 22&quot;. Completely oblivious to his change, he flipped through the next several <br />
pages, having already read them.<br />
7'4&quot;, 7'5&quot;, 7'6&quot;, 7'7&quot;, 7'8&quot;, 7'9&quot;. Size 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Cock 23&quot;, 24&quot;, 25&quot;, 26&quot;, 27&quot;, 28&quot;.<br />
Noah readjusted himself in seat, it was strange, he was having such a hard time getting comfortable. <br />
Unbeknownst to him, his body was growing to epic proportions, he was now covered in hair. It coated his arms <br />
and his legs, even his hands, heavily, and great jungles of it burst from his armpits and groin. Meanwhile his <br />
muscles were increasing ever-larger, his shoulders now three times as wide as the average man.<br />
He ignored his slight discomfort and continued reading, trying to find where had stopped before. He scanned <br />
another page, and another, and another, and arrived at the illustrations. 8'0&quot;, 8'1&quot;, 8'2&quot;. Shoes size 33, 34, <br />
35. And his cock 29&quot;, 30&quot;, 31&quot;. <br />
Ah yes, the illustrations, he had just finished those. He flipped through them even more quickly. Five pages <br />
passed in the blink of an eye.<br />
8'3&quot;, 8'4&quot;, 8'5&quot;, 8'6&quot;, 8'7&quot;. Size 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Cock 32&quot;, 33&quot;, 34&quot;, 35&quot;, 36&quot;<br />
Oh finally, here he was. Darwin was just beginning to talk of nonrandom mating. Standing at a height of well <br />
over 8 feet, with a 3 foot soft cock that ran far below his knees, and a face that was more ape than man, Noah <br />
settled into the chair, which was getting ever more uncomfortable, to continue reading...</p>
