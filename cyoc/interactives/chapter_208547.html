<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hannah waht happened,&quot; Joey asked nervously. &quot;My head feels funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah me too,&quot; Hannah replied, the energetic 6 year old rubbing her chin in confusion. Looking at the IPad she could see the Chronovac was still open, Mrs. Fuentes and her family still present on the screen. &quot;I think this thing changed things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should stop then,&quot; Joey replied nervously, once more tucking his knees under his shirt. &quot;It&#39;ll probably give us cancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cancer,&quot; Hannah asked raising an eyebrow. &quot;Whats cancer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its a really bad disease,&quot; Joey whispered. &quot;My mom says you can die. And what&#39;s even scarier is you can get it from like everything. The sun, the microwave, even IPads!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think Becky would have us play with an IPad if it was going to make us sick,&quot; Hannah replied. Joey seemed unconvinced, the boy nervously glancing at the touchscreen. Hannah now tried to reassure Joey everything would be okay, until something caught her attention. &quot;Hey whats that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey and Hannah watched as a new profile now popped up on. Hannah and Joey studying the name curiously. &quot;Mar..i..sol,&quot; Hannah sounded out. &quot;Marisol Fuentes. Is she related to Mrs. Fuentes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes really old,&quot; Joey stated. &quot;She&#39;s 60.&quot; Hannah nodded in agreement, a mischievous smirk crossing her face as she tapped on Marisol Fuentes age. &quot;I wonder if we can change that,&quot; she smirked, pressing a button. &quot;Hannah No,&quot; Joey exclaimed, the boy watching as his best friend giggled at the changes she had made.<br />
<br />
Inside the Fuentes-Katral home, Marisol Fuentes entered the front door, calling for Alicia. The elderly woman had been planning this trip for sometime, looking forward to seeing her grandson Cris and spending time with her daughter. Placing her luggage down in the front foyer, she was about to call for Alicia again when an odd feeling washed over her.<br />
<br />
Placing her hand on her forehead, Marisol chalked it up to just being tired from the long drive. Heading into the living room, she was unaware of the changes overtaking her as she began to grow younger.<br />
<br />
Retreating quickly through her 50s, Marisol&#39;s grey hair began to vanish, the ebony locks overtaking them with each step she took. Marisol slight wrinkles began to fade, her skin smoothing out and becoming healthier. &quot;Huh where is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marisol stood for a moment, wondering where her daughter was as she grew younger. The womans mind changing with the loss of years. When she became 50, Marisol recalled being a teenage mother. The two of them struggling before Marisol was able succeed. It had forced the two women to grow up together essentially, making the relationship more of a sisterly one than a mother daughter relationship. That reality changed though as Marisol crept closer to 40.<br />
<br />
As Marisol became 40 the changes to the womans history and body were becoming more extravagant. Marisol&#39;s hair had now lost all of its grey, returning to its original black, her skin tone evening losing any wrinkles that had once been so prominent around her eyes and mouth. Placing her hands on her hips, Marisol didn&#39;t realize she was losing weight, her body toning, her breasts regaining some of their fullness.<br />
<br />
The changes in Marisol&#39;s reality were even more intense. Now instead of being Alicia&#39;s mother, she was her older sister. The woman had decided to visit her sister and brother in law for vacation, hoping to take the couple out to dinner and spend time with her adorable nephew. &quot;Alicia you here,&quot; she called. &quot;Its me Maris.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maris frowned, she always hated trying to find her sister. Memories of calling for the girl when they were growing up surfacing in her memories. Maris chuckled softly, remembering with fondness how it always annoyed her having to call for her kid sister for dinner. <br />
<br />
The changes continued, Maris descending further in age. Traveling back through her 30s, Maris&#39;s skin grew healthier, obtaining a more youthful glow. The womans body firming, her breasts continuing to rise, becoming mature and round C cups with a generous amount of curve around her hips. <br />
<br />
As she hit 30 and began trekking back through her 20s the changes were becoming more prominent. Maris&#39;s face becoming more youthful, rounding slightly as it became less angular, her body toning losing the slight love handles along her sides. As she hit 20, Maris now made her way into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well find something to eat,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Beats the stuff they serve at school.&quot; The 20 year old Maris&#39;s now altered again. Now she was the kid sister, attending college. Maris had now come to see her sister and brother in law. She was now on Spring break, deciding instead of going away to see her family With two suitcases full of laundry the 20 year old coed was looking forward to some home cooking and catching up. Opening the fridge, the college woman spotted a soda taking a sip before trying to decide what to eat.<br />
<br />
As Maris now reentered her teens, her body continued to change. The teens body growing slimmer, her large breasts firming as they lost their fullness, her face continuing to round giving her an innocent look. Maris and Alicia&#39;s relationship continued to change as the age gap increased. The sisters relationship going from sisterly to almost motherly, Alicia always trying to keep an eye out for her spunky little sister. As Maris now grabbed a glass, she had no idea that her relationship was about to change once more.<br />
<br />
Maris now began to retreat into her earlier teens, the girls curves evaporating, her breasts gradually decreasing in size. Crossing the threshold from teen to preteen the 12 year old now began to grow shorter, her face rounding and becoming more childish. As she went from 12 to 11 puberty began to abandon her, her breasts shrinking into softball sized mounds. Now she was the eldest daughter of Zek and Alicia, her mother had gotten pregnant on her honeymoon, giving birth to Alicia 9 months later. The girl now paused, heading back to the fridge and grabbing a juice box. &quot;Cris is probably thirsty,&quot; she said softly as she headed towards the boys room.<br />
<br />
As Maris now headed towards the stairs she continued to grow younger. By 10 all evidence of puberty had abandoned the girl. By 9 she had begun to grow smaller, the girls held rising an the banister as she ascended the stairs. With each step she lost more years, her body shrinking, her face rounding. Maris&#39;s hair ebony hair bouncing as she sprinted by the stairs. As she reached the top, the regression ceased leaving the girl a sunny yet shy 6 year old.<br />
<br />
As Maris now walked towards Cris room reality began to alter. She and Cris were now twins, their rooms directly across from one another. The study that Zek used as an exercise room transforming into a little girls room. A small canopy bed appearing surrounded by stuffed animals. The walls taking on a light purple hue. <br />
<br />
Reality continued to alter, cementing around the newly minted twins. Cris was more athletic with an interest on dogs. Maris, however, was not. The girl was often described as a sweetheart by her teachers yet was also very shy. She, like Joey, was nervous about different things, mostly when it came to public speaking. Maris had been slow when it came to making friends, tagging along with her more outgoing brother but remaining quiet. That was until she met Joey.<br />
<br />
As odd as it sounded, she rather liked the quirky, neurotic boy. Joey was a nice boy, Maris actually having developed a bit of a puppy dog crush on him in very much the same way Lizzie had developed a crush on Tommy. As she approached Cris room with a juice box, she was nearly run over by Cris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon Maris,&quot; he said excitedly. &quot;Everyone is playing soccer outside let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Maris replied meekly, handing her twin his juice box. &quot;I thought we were going to watch a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can watch it later,&quot; he replied, noticing his sisters discomfort. &quot;Besides, I think Joey is over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maris seemed to perk up at Joey&#39;s name, the girl now running with her twin as they exited the house to join the otbers.</p>
