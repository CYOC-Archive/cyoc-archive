<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Max was sleeping his mouth open and Jeff was hanging out to the side dangling over the boy&#39;s lips and resting on his pillow. The pillow was soaked with drool as Max rolled over pressing Jeff between it and Max&#39;s snout.<br />
        Max woke up the next morning his pillow soggy with doggy drool. He wiped his mouth off while pulling Jeff back inside. Jeff felt at home inside the boy&#39;s mouth resting between his teeth feeling his breath flowing against him. He felt Max moving around and heard him peeing. Max started brushing his teeth and tongue lathering Jeff up in a slobbery mix of drool and toothpaste before spitting the whole mess into the sink. He went back into his bedroom and picked up his pillow to change the pillow case. Rubbing the slobbery fabric in his paws he had an idea. He picked up a clean pair of paw patrol undies and opened his mouth, sticking his tongue out and slobbering over them, leaving globs of drool on the fabric he pulled them up and rubbed himself through them, mixing his drool against his sheath and testicles. Giggling softly to himself he finished getting ready and skipped happily into the kitchen.<br />
       &quot; Somebody&#39;s happy&quot; Max skidded to a stop and hopped up on a chair &quot; I get to go to Eric&#39;s house after school today, I can&#39;t wait to play together&quot;. &quot; Just behave yourself ok&quot; Max finished his cereal covering Jeff in a slobbery mix of drool and milk &quot; are you ready for school&quot; &quot; just have to brush my teeth&quot; Max ran out of my kitchen and went to the bathroom.<br />
         Max grabbed his toothbrush and squeezed out some toothpaste, he got the toothbrush wet and opened his mouth and started brushing. He pushed it all the way back covering his teeth from every direction before switching to his tongue. This was Jeff&#39;s favorite part of the day aside from being played with was his twice a day cleaning, it felt so good having that toothbrush rubbing against his slobbery length it was almost erotic. Max rinsed his mouth out with some mouthwash and smiled showing his shiny whites. He hopped down off the stool and went downstairs.<br />
       Max met up with Eric and Darren in the playground before school started, the boys played around on the monkey bars seeing who could go the farthest. The bell rang and the boys grabbed their backpacks and went inside. Max could hardly sit still during class. He was too excited about recess and going to Eric&#39;s house after school. The day dragged on until it was finally lunch time. Max sat down next to Darren, Sam and Eric and opened his lunch box finding a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, he took a big bite covering Jeff in peanut butter. He finished his lunch and juice box just in time for recess. The boys went out together and went to their hiding place. All four boys pulled their penises out of their pants and giggled as they wiggled their hips making their soft penises flop around. <br />
       Max Sam and Eric were panting lightly and Darren took the chance to examine their slobbery tongues rubbing them between his fingers. Max grabbed Darren&#39;s thick penis as he passed and placed it against his comparing the size. It wasn&#39;t even close. Darren was way longer and thicker. All four boys quickly gathered around and compared their penises. Max and Sam were close in size and shape, both boys had strange lumps near the base of their penises while Eric&#39;s was longer than theirs and covered in weird looking spines , Darren was still the winner in length and thickness with a flat rigged tip. The boys continued to compare their penises until the bell rang and they had to go inside.<br />
       The rest of the day passed and before long it was time to go home. Max meet up with Eric and the boys got their backpacks and went headed out together &quot; I take the school bus home so we have to wait I really need to go pee &quot; &quot; yeah me too&quot; the boys went to the boys restroom and picked a urinal together, pulling their pants down they peed together before washing their paws and going out to the bus stop.<br />
     It was a short ride to Eric&#39;s house and the boys walked together to the front door, as they got closer the door opened and Max&#39;s dad&#39;s were standing there&quot; I have two dads&quot; &quot; that&#39;s so cool no icky girls&quot; Eric looked relieved&quot; yeah&quot; . The boys went inside and were greeted by Eric&#39;s dad&#39;s &quot; so this is Max, we&#39;ve heard quite a lot about you the last few days we&#39;re happy you could come over. Do you boys have any homework? Let&#39;s get that done before we go play&quot; Max and Eric sat down together at the kitchen table and did their homework &quot; all done dad were going to my room&quot; <br />
         Eric&#39;s room was awesome. He had posters on all the walls showing every super villain in every universe. What little of the walls that was visible was a dark gray. &quot; Yeah both my  dads are  really into villains and heroes but the villains are cooler &quot; Max looked around his mouth agape in wonder, Jeff was amazed as well from what he could see better Max&#39;s slobbery lips and teeth. Eric sneaky grabbed Jeff and used him to gently pull Max over to his toy box&quot; let&#39;s play action figures don&#39;t worry about getting them wet I so that all the time &quot; he let go of Jeff and Max quickly closed his mouth returning Jeff to his warm wet paradise. The boys played for a while until there was a soft knock on the door &quot; you two hungry? Want a snack? &quot; Eric stood up and said, &quot; Can we have chocolate pudding?&quot; &quot; I don&#39;t see why not Max&#39;s mom didn&#39;t say anything about not having sugar &quot; the boys followed him to the kitchen table and eagerly opened the snacks. <br />
         Jeff felt himself sliding around Max&#39;s mouth as the boy ate the sweet chocolate pudding mixed with the boy&#39;s drool and created a pleasant feeling, sticky, smooth and jiggly Jeff loved it and wanted it to last forever. After snacks the boys went back to Eric&#39;s room and continued playing. <br />
&quot; Wanna see my penis again?&quot; The question caught Max off guard and he dropped the toy &quot; of course I do I&#39;ll show you mine too&quot; the boys undressed completely clothes flying in every direction and they stood together penises almost touching &quot; what are those things&quot; Max asked pointing to Eric&#39;s penis &quot; someone told me that those are barbs when I get older and I start puberty they do things&quot; Max looked closer &quot; what&#39;s puberty&quot; Eric played with himself &quot; it&#39;s when you get older and you penis starts getting stiff and stuff, your penis will get bigger and your knot will grow&quot; &quot; knot like a shoe? &quot; Eric giggled &quot; no silly your knot&quot; he held Max&#39;s soft penis &quot; this is your knot when you get older and your penis gets stiff this gets bigger, it&#39;s supposed to keep you stuck to a girl like my barbs&quot; Max looked down at the penises between them &quot; how do you know that&quot; Eric shrugged &quot; I used to have a babysitter before we moved who told me everything about boys and girls &quot; did you know that they have to sit down to pee. Max nodded&quot; yeah my mom hates when I leave the seat up. <br />
          After a few hours of playtime it was time to go home. Max and Eric got dressed after trading underwear and went to the living room to say goodbye. Max&#39;s mom was waiting and talking to Eric&#39;s dad&#39;s &quot; ready to go sweetie, did you have fun&quot;. Max nodded and struggled with his shoes. After getting some help he was ready &quot; by Eric thanks for inviting me over and thanks for the snack&quot; Eric hugged him &quot; your my new best friend&quot; the adults watched the boys smiling at the innocence of youth. After the hug Max&#39;s mom picked up his backpack and the two went home.</p>
