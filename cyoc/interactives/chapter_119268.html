<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed considered the merits of class for all of ten seconds before dismissing the idea. Not only would he have to explain his tattered clothes--his jeans alone wouldn&#39;t fit over his now-bulging calves--but the idea of trying to fit in with all the other 12-year-olds seemed even less appealing now. He already looked like a teenager; why not become one?<br />
<br />
Mind made up, Ed began looking around for something to wear. He&#39;d gone without underwear this morning anyway, his old briefs in no way built to handle his larger thighs and dick, so he needed a full outfit. An idea came as he looked around the room, taking in the lockers belonging to the baseball team. And in luck one was missing a lock.<br />
<br />
The clothes inside were rather long on him, as even with his new muscles and testosterone he was barely pushing 5&#39;6&quot; and his proportions didn&#39;t yet match, but they fit well enough to pass. He was almost sad to put his shirt back on and cover the gloriously hairy pecs; he consoled himself with rubbing a hand over his jaw, absently noticing that his 5 o&#39;clock shadow was a bit thicker than it had been when he&#39;d shaved before, reminding him that this new him needed to shave twice a day. He could only imagine what he&#39;d be like once he actually hit puberty; his cock started to thicken at the thought, pressing against the leg of his stolen jeans. At almost 7 inches hard it almost reached his knee, heightening the obscene contrast to his short form.<br />
<br />
Once Ed was dressed he made his way towards the high school classes on the other side of campus. A few people looked him over, one girl even winking and asking &quot;Jacob&quot; if he&#39;d been working out. As much as the mistaken identity annoyed him Ed couldn&#39;t hold back a smirk; nobody would be mistaking him for Jacob once he&#39;d added on a few years. If he already matched Jacob&#39;s looks now then what would he be like at 18?<br />
<br />
He headed into the gym, looking for someone out of the way enough for him to transform in peace. His gaze finally settled on a boy studying behind the bleachers, instantly recognizing him as a member of the swimming team. His name was Jack and he was the talk of the school, attractive and fit and nice to boot, short brown hair over a toned but not beefy form. He had just turned 19, making him the perfect subject for Ed&#39;s experiment.<br />
<br />
Jack&#39;s head was down in a book so he didn&#39;t notice Ed approach from behind, and even if he had he wouldn&#39;t have had time to react before Ed&#39;s strong yet short arms wrapped around his midsection. He stiffened, breath hitching, as his &#39;adult status&#39; was copied into Ed.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Ed did when he pulled away was yank off his shirt, his thankfully-oversized jeans slipping down as he did. This gave him a perfect view as the changes took effect.<br />
<br />
Ed was already a hairy 12-year-old to begin with, a small patch of dusty hair between his nipples and a thin line of fuzz travelling to his belly button. The first and most obvious change was the tiny, barely-there hairs all but exploding out of their pores. Thick wiry hairs replaced  tiny stubs, the patch on his chest darkening until there was more hair than skin. At the same time it began to spread, reaching out to his nipples first before thickening until it covered his new pecs in dark curls.<br />
<br />
His budding treasure trail became a treasure highway; the hairs circling his belly button thickened and spread outward, flooding downwards to circle his crotch and upwards to connect to his chest hair. The path grew thicker until it covered his entire abs, the hair growing so high he could feel it join into his beard across the entire bottom of his neck, sweeping up and across his shoulders. From there it traveled down his arms--thinning at his biceps but only to a level far beyond any normal man&#39;s--and covered his forearms and hands in thick dark hair. His legs were next to follow as they became sasquatch-like trunks, his feet comparable to a Hobbit.<br />
<br />
Ed&#39;s attention was so focused on the hair, his hands running over his body in awe, that he would have missed the next change if it wasn&#39;t so obvious. As his body rushed through puberty testosterone flooded every cell, enhancing the already masculine boy into a man of equal status. Muscles which were already abnormal on a child swelled beyond any genetic capabilities, pushing out until his body surpassed Captain America. To compensate his height did the same, his body stretching until he was just over seven feet tall.<br />
<br />
Last--but certainly not least--was his cock. Puberty had enhanced Ed&#39;s hairiness and musculature into legendary areas but its greatest effect would be on his penis. Testosterone-filled blood surged through it as Ed moaned in pleasure, one enormous hand grabbing the wall as he watched his cock swell to match the rest of him. From six inches hard it almost tripled in size, falling to his knee as it reached a staggering 16 1/2 inches in length. Then it fattened until it was wider than a man&#39;s forearm--wider than any vagina could possibly hope to stretch. His balls surged with semen as they fattened, smacking loudly against his thigh as his sex drive was driven to unimaginable hights.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Ed he hadn&#39;t anticipated the side-effects. One hand continued to run through his thick body hair as the other fell to his cock, wrapping one meaty paw around the shaft and stroking. His eyes clouded over with lust as a desperate, inhuman urge to fuck soared through him. New memories told him that this had been his life ever since he turned 18; a stud constantly, desperately seeking relief.<br />
<br />
Lust-filled eyes fell on Jack, the teen recovering just in time for his mouth to open wide at the beast before him...</p>
