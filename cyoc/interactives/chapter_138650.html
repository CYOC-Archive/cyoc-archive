<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Impressed with the results so far, Steve wanted to try for himself, so he left the others to go upstairs to try it out for himself. He sat down on in front of the computer and worked himself through the menus, starting to get more and more excited about what he was about to do. After a couple of minutes he was finished. He didn&#39;t want to damage his clothes to he stripped naked before he started the transformation. He set it to be slow and in steps, but it would first cover his now clearly evident boner as one of the first changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go&quot;, Steve said breathing out while clicking on start. At first his skin around his pelvis became baggy and folds stretched across his boner. Those folds connected, forming a single surface pressing against it. This actually made him even more excited and he tried to touch it, feeling his fingers on both the skin and his member, sending a shiver though his body. Then further folds started to develop, gradually forming pockets. The skin on his lower body started to change its colour to a dark shade of brown. Gradually everything from his ankles to his waist-like started to form into a set of brown leather pants, not unlike the ones you&#39;d find on a biker.<br />
<br />
Then the changes spread to his upper body, at first it seemed as if he got buffed up a bit, but then the skin started to change colour to the same brown as his pants, gradually folds started to become pockets. On one of the pockets on his chest a nametag formed, proclaiming that it&#39;s wearer, or in fact its name was Steve. As the zipper formed, Steve opened it to find his bare chest behind it. Reaching to the back, he found that the jacket was firmly attached to his back. &quot;Perfect&quot;, he said as the full jacket formed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile his friend came back from the garage. &quot;Dude, you should have told us&quot;, cried Jeff. &quot;Don&#39;t worry the best is still to come&quot;, Steve claimed as his head was changing. At first his hair grew in length, particularly on the back and the sides. As it grew over his ears, it formed lumps covering his ears, as well as a smaller lump extending from one of those to his mouth. At the same time part of his hair extended forwards hardening as a thin horizontal sheet. Above that sheet on his head a pair of transparent windows appeared moving outwards pulling a rim along them. Gradually a baseball cap along with a pair of goggles and a noise-canceling headset appeared as the changes stopped. <br />
<br />
His friends saw his boner, tenting his pants, but mostly ignored it as they watched the spectacle. &quot;Well there&#39;s more to come&quot;, said as the next set of changed set in. First his head changed, he grew a stubble which was growing thicker and thicker. a hairy skin fold started to peak out of his headset and pointing back. At the same time his mouth moved forward, making it longer and longer, resembling the one of a kangaroo more and more. Then the changes of his naked skin began to spread downwards. A wave of ocker beige fur started to sprout, spreading down to his whole body which could be seen as he left open his jacket. Reaching his hands, they started to also become furred, but leaving out pads at his fingers at which his skin darkened to almost black. His fingernails also darkened and formed black non-retractable claws. His feet first became furred, but then increased in length to what seemed twice their length, pads and claws formed as some of his toed merged into one. Above his ass a long blob extruded forming a furred muscular tail. It nearly went unnoticed that he was shrinking a considerable amount to perhaps about half or two thirds his usual height, though his feet would make up for it.<br />
<br />
However as the tail formed its tip stared to get wider, forming a vertical plane. On that wall holes started to appear quickly growing into segments. On the sides of his tail horizontal surfaces grew gradually changing into the fantail of a helicopter. Then at his back a lump formed. On its sides a pair of turbo shaft engines grew with air intakes pointing upwards and the exhaust pointing to the sides and back. Between them a spike grew out, splitting up to the sides and gently forming rotor blades along with the assembly.<br />
<br />
As the final touches entered completion, an anthropomorphic kangaroo stood before the audience in awe. Steve wore leather clothes as well as a baseball cap and a heavy duty noise-cancelling headset along with goggles he could pull down to use. On his back was what appeared to be a fully working helicopter assembly with the engines covered in brown metallic metal which matched the tail rotor assembly on his tail. Steve shifted his posture to stand on his toes and hopped a hop towards his friends. &quot;See, now I&#39;m done.&quot;</p>
