<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly Fitzgerald&#39;s parents and her ever patient boyfriend were sitting outside in the waiting room, patiently praying to see their missing daughter and girlfriend for the first time in a decade. The parents had been informed of Shelly&#39;s reappearance within an hour of the DNA match, an expunged account of what happened to her was recited, and they were informed of when they would be able to see her. Excited, Eileen Fitzgerald finally told the now twenty-six year old Gary Cole over the phone, and (s)he also rushed to the police station. When the interrogation door finally opened, Shelly saw three attractive women. She had prepped for this moment. Tears were in her eyes, but she still had trouble accepting that the Great Change had happened. Was she supposed to hug these people? She stared, and began to speak.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Regina could see where this was going. Aziza was taking to magic like a fish to water. In no time flat, Regina bet that she&#39;d have power like a goddess and go off and create life in some far distant galaxy. An Arab, female Superman on steroids. Herself, on the other hand, was still being pushed by her innate empiricism a as scientist, wanting to push the rules and the boundaries of what she was observing as a very capricious rule system. Magic to her seemed more like an ad hoc government bureaucracy than the elegant system of physics she had grown up revering, or even the futuristic physics she had learned about in the library earlier, which had already been discovered by other forms of life. She thought glumly to herself that Aziza was a cinch to beat her whenever this supposed contest was supposed to take place. If Regina couldn&#39;t even detect something as relatively simple like an illusion casting spell, what chance did she really have? Aziza also must have messed with her mind, which she didn&#39;t appreciate.<br />
<br />
She needed an ace up her sleeve, a way to make sure the power dynamic between new friend and her could stay out of whack. And like the stubborn Reece, Regina Chung didn&#39;t want to give in just yet.<br />
<br />
**<br />
At Sammy&#39;s house, she and Billie were playing with Lego blocks and the toy trucks they had had as boys. Sammy had somehow magically inherited a Barbie doll collection as well, and while she liked those too, embracing her girlishness much like Allison Parker had, the more tomboyish Billie preferred to build spaceships and such.<br />
<br />
The two young girls were being babysat by Sammy&#39;s older sister Emily, who still was living at home due to the cost of university life. Mrs. and Mrs. Stafford were upstairs, and if Emily had cared to take a listen, she might have shuddered at what her parents were probably up to. Her father George, now Georgia, had been transformed by the Great Change from a short, fat, balding man into the ultimate ginger dream body, and her mother Molly fared very closely to that. In fact, except for their facial characteristics being markedly different, as well as their eyes(Georgia possessing hazel eyes, while Molly&#39;s was brown), you might have confused them for twins now if you just went by their bodies, which upped the squick factor by ten. So they were upstairs, doing whatever it was middle aged parents transformed into young hotties do when they&#39;re alone, while Emily watched reruns of Gravity Falls and kept her little sis and her little sis&#39;s best friend in her peripheral vision. <br />
<br />
Emily herself didn&#39;t really mind this setup, because she herself was a bit of cartoon fanatic herself despite being a freshman in college. She wondered to herself how Gravity Falls, and all media made before the Great Change, would fare say five years from now. She had read that studios and networks and other content creators were already in a panic to adapt their movies and shows to account for the fact that everyone was a lesbian, and that nearly everyone was drop dead gorgeous. She thanked her lucky stars that no new episodes were being planned to air, because she just couldn&#39;t imagine Gideon or Grunkle Stan drawn as women.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you like being  like being dominated by the little lesbian slut, don&#39;t you, you whore?&quot; teased Robbie erotically, already having exposed Elizabeth&#39;s bare breasts, tossing her blouse to the floor. She started to suck on Liz&#39;s nipples violently while helping Elizabeth pull her pants off with her one free hand. Once off, Elizabeth kicked them to a far corner of the living room and started to finger Robbie&#39;s vagina through her panties. This sent electric shocks up Robbie&#39;s sensory input system. The collective moans were sweet and lilting.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Kayla watched Martha shake her head, curse to herself, and slam her hand on the horn excessively loudly when one car cut her off. She was tense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Kayla.<br />
<br />
Martha sighed. &quot;I KNOW that I just figured out something important, and then, in a flash, it was gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That happens all the time&quot; said Kayla. &quot;If it&#39;s important, it&#39;ll probably come up again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; said Martha. &quot;Not with me. My mind is a steel trap. I never forget anything. I just KNEW that I cracked something very important, and for the goddamn life of me, I can&#39;t remember what it is, and it&#39;s driving me CRAZY!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it about Greta Von Hauser?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha stared blankly at the road and said &quot;Maybe. I just can&#39;t remember. If it does have to do with her though, when we find her, there will be hell to pay. NOBODY touches my mind and gets away with it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha had never told Kayla about her experiences with experimental psychotronic weapons back in the 60s. She was giving a lecture at Harvard on cold fusion&#39;s potentiality with more focus and an increased budget, when she had suddenly come down with a very bizarre, unexplained sickness while on stage, and couldn&#39;t finish. She had seen two men in the audience with what, she had realized, were devices pointed at her and designed to interrupt her mental faculties. The reasons why she had never found out, but somebody had obviously wanted to silence her. It had taken ten years, but by happenstance, she ran into one of men much later, a big, burly, bald white man that looked like The Thing, and she sucker punched him so badly that he had to be carried out on a stretcher. And Martha had been an old woman back then too, which was even more impressive. That&#39;s what Greta would get if she ever found out about the psychologist&#39;s errant wish to never be discovered. <br />
<br />
Baby Jo babbled &quot;Weta&quot; and pissed in her diaper.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, that was embarrassing. I felt so sorry for the players&quot; said Allison as she and Logan and Katharine parked into the Hanley&#39;s driveway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, no kidding. I wonder if baseball is even going to survive now&quot; said Logan, worried that it wouldn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure things will settle back to normal somehow&quot; added Katharine, trying to keep things upbeat. &quot;It&#39;s not like women can&#39;t play baseball. Jesus, even when we&#39;re all women, misogyny still abounds.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, it didn&#39;t look like they could play worth a shit, Mom&quot; said Logan.<br />
<br />
Katharine chuckled as she walked inside, leaving her daughter and her little girlfriend alone for a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, that freaked me out. Not enough to make me want to hurt myself, but I was wondering the entire time, can we even PLAY basketball anymore?&quot; queried Logan. &quot;Or what about Cyril...I mean Kira. Is she even tall enough to play now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison grinned, not having informed Logan yet about Kira&#39;s new life as a dom, with basketball probably the furthest thing from her mind right now.<br />
<br />
Oddly, both Logan and Allison were standing right next to a basketball hoop, and a ball was present. Allison bent over and picked it up, tossing it to Logan. She then took over her jacket and threw it on the lawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets see how good you still are. I bet that even as girly as I am, I could still beat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
James had not yet informed Aziza or Regina of who he really was. He suspected they already knew, or could at least venture a guess. He still wanted to see where this went, if Regina had the potential to master the universe the way his sister has foreseen. <br />
<br />
Greta and Jean, meanwhile, were utterly bewildered by what was going on.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew what was going on&quot; asked Greta in the present day.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew what was going on&quot; asked Greta in the past.</p>
