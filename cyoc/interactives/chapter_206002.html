<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to join her on the trip. You were kind of looking forward to some time off, but being out of the house meant you didn&#39;t have to listen to &#39;David&#39; and his gloating, for lack of a better word. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe I will.&quot; You said. &quot;I&#39;ll just grab some clothes and be on my way, so you can shower&quot; you added while rummaging through the clothes in your new closet. During the week you&#39;d only been wearing your father&#39;s suits, so you didn&#39;t have to do much picking. You looked forward to not having to wear the tight shirt around your large belly and uncomfortable tie around your neck. Even if that meant picking something out of your father&#39;s closet. Even if it was your closet now. It really hammered home that you were no longer David. David was now your son. The anger was swelling up again. You didn&#39;t want to be Steve and the fact your former father, now son, loved being David made it worse. <br />
<br />
You found a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. That would do fine. As you were about to exit the bedroom, &#39;David&#39; called out from the other side. <br />
&quot;Hey, mom, DAD? I&#39;ll bring some of MY friends over today, if that&#39;s fine?&quot;. You could hear he was really happy about asking that question from the tone of his voice and how he had put such stress on &#39;dad&#39; and &#39;my&#39;. Just like he had done since the experiment. &quot;Yeah, sure&quot; you answered with an annoyed tone of voice. You looked over at the woman you had once called mom and said &quot;Cathy, I&#39;ll join you.&quot; She nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
As you made your exit and went downstairs you were greeted by Brad sitting in front of the TV, watching cartoons and eating cereal. &quot;monin daddy&quot; he said. He was still struggling a bit with his R&#39;s. Good thing he was old enough to eat cereal by himself. So far, Cathy had been the one waking him up. But you were expected to help out. You were his &#39;father&#39; after all. You weren&#39;t annoyed when Brad called you daddy, unlike when &#39;David&#39; did it. Brad was simply too young to understand what had been going on. You were, in Brad&#39;s mind, his actual father. Not his brother turned father. Odds were Brad would not remember anything about this as he grew up and you&#39;d probably never tell him the reality either. Let him live in a world were people don&#39;t swap bodies with their fathers.<br />
<br />
Mariah had also already gotten up, even thought it wasn&#39;t all that early. &quot;Good morning, dad!&quot; she said teasingly when she saw you. She was taking after her mother when it came to looks. A larger girl but with a pair of tits big enough to &quot;make up&quot; for it - so she was fairly popular with the boys at school. But you were pretty sure the girls teased her. At least, that&#39;s what you told yourself, because even before the swap, Mariah would tease you any chance she could. That it was a way to act out her own frustrations about being teased. After the swap, the teasing had gotten worse and just like &#39;David&#39; she loved to gloat. Calling you dad every opportunity she could get, making remarks about your weight or age or receding hairline. It wasn&#39;t quite as bad as when &#39;David&#39; would gloat as &#39;David&#39; loved making sure you knew he had gotten the sweeter end of the bargain. Mariah was merely being mean.  <br />
<br />
Lucas had apparently woken up early as well, which was unusual. &quot;Good morning, Davi...&quot; He stopped himself. &quot;Good morning, dad....&quot; he ended up getting out instead. Lucas had not been onboard with the whole &quot;Assume the other one&#39;s life and identity&quot; thing and regularly slipped up. If only you two were around, he didn&#39;t even bother correcting himself if he did slip up. Every time he called you David, you felt happy. Like someone at least was ready to acknowledge how fucked up this whole thing was, rather than trying their best to ignore it and cover it up. But you were part of the problem. You had given in directly and agreed. Calling your former mother for Hon, Honey, Cathy, Catherine and even a babe once, to try and pretend you weren&#39;t actually mother and son. You had been calling your former father son, David and what not. So that he could fuel his sick idea of being you in all regards. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the devil, the new David came down the stairs as well. &quot;Oh, Hi dad&quot; he said with that smug face. &quot;Mom said you&#39;re going shopping? Could you two pick up some protein powder at the store? I want to start working out and get a more athletic physique.&quot; he added. &quot;Maybe you should start working out as well, dad? I know you were fit in your youth, but that&#39;s a while ago now, you can&#39;t live on old merits. We could work out together?!&quot; he continued, now with an even smugger face. He&#39;d found away to not just call you old but also fat. Sure, you would like to lose some fat, but you weren&#39;t going to do it while working out with &#39;David&#39;. He&#39;d spend the whole time making sure you knew he was the young boy and you the fat old man. <br />
<br />
With that, your &#39;wife&#39; came downstairs. &quot;Are you ready to go, honey?&quot; she said, with you instantly reacting by looking over at her and replying with a &quot;yeah&quot;. It had only been a week of this and you were already so used to this woman calling you pet names you reacted by hearth. &#39;David&#39; didn&#39;t react at all - he had surprisingly quickly learned to tune that out. He would only react if Cathy called him &quot;son&quot; or &quot;David&quot;. He was probably doing everything he could to take over your life as fast as possible and he was succeeding. As both Mariah and &#39;David&#39; was going to be home, you felt you could leave Brad with them rather than stringing him along for the shopping. It would make things smoother.<br />
<br />
You started with driving over to the mall to get the other shopping out of the way first. Turned out one of the things she was going to get wasn&#39;t actually her getting something. It was you. She more or less dragged you into a clothing store. As money wasn&#39;t really tight anymore after the experiment, she felt you were allowed to buy some new clothes. You were Steve now, but that didn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t put your own touches on who Steve was, she figured. You decided to try out some t-shirts you liked but Cathy kept shooting you down. She insisted you&#39;d go for something more adult. You ended up trying on a pair of slacks and a shirt of the more casual variety. You weren&#39;t sold on it at all and it was quite unlike what Steve had used to wear. But Cathy insisted you looked handsome. She even made you wear it out of the store. You felt a bit uncomfortable thought. The shirt wasn&#39;t as snug around the waist as the one you wore to work but the arms felt tight. Steve was a big guy and not just fat, which was most apparent when looking at your arms. You decided to roll up your sleeves which did feel better. Cathy glanced over at what you were doing. She seemed to like what she saw as you rolled the sleeves up based on the smile on her face. &quot;Oh, I do love a man in a nice shirt with rolled up sleeves. You look really good&quot; she said while keeping an intense stare on your forearms. You thought you&#39;d hate her giving you compliments about your look because of the implications. But it felt no weirder than before the swap. <br />
<br />
The second stop was at a lingerie store. You were far too embarrassed to follow your &#39;wife&#39; inside. She was only there to pick up a bra she had specially ordered.  Her breasts were as you knew a little too well at this point - massive. As you sat outside on a bench, she told you she&#39;d be back real quick but while she was there, she&#39;d get something else as well. After a while, you overheard her talking with the store clerk about the bra. Apparently she had ordered a size 40K. You had no clue what that meant other than that it was clearly a sizeable bra if they were to contain Cathy&#39;s tits. The mental image of her large, naked breasts this morning returned to you. It was incredibly wrong, but you could feel your slacks getting tighter. Well, this body wasn&#39;t related to her and the hormones of this body was probably playing a prank on you. You shut your eyes and thought about something else to get the image out of your mind. You must have been lost in thought as Cathy sat down next to you and poked you with an &quot;Hello, Honey? I said I&#39;m done. Let&#39;s get out of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you buy?&quot; You asked as if you wanted to know. You didn&#39;t really, thought. Knowing she had bought a bra was good enough. The rest was better left alone if you were honest. But it still felt like a nice thing to ask. &quot;Oh... Nothing special&quot; she said, looking away from you. Her cheeks red, clearly embarrassed. Yeah, you had been better of leaving it alone. Hindsight is 20/20. <br />
<br />
Afterwards you went to get groceries for the week. It was all over quick and easy, the woman you now called wife went through the aisles with expert precision. As you finally got home you were greeted by &#39;David&#39; and &#39;his&#39; friends. It definitely felt weird having the friends come over. Just two weeks ago they young boys having a great time had been your friends but none of them was any wiser. It also felt bad no one of them seemed to notice anything off with the David they&#39;d been hanging out with the last week. the new David was taking over this aspect of your old life with too much ease. &quot;Oh, hi dad&quot; &#39;David&#39; said, engrossed in the game they were playing, just like the last time he had brought his friends over. You hated to admit it, but they were clearly his friends now. It was almost lunch time, so you put the groceries away and started with making lunch for your family. <br />
<br />
Just like last time, you could overhear them talking. Yet again, they were discussing girls. Yet again, Cathy was helping you out while having to listen to her former husband discuss teenage girls he&#39;d like to get with. &#39;David&#39; was girl crazy, if nothing else. But this time, Cathy didn&#39;t look as bothered. Actually, she kept helping you peel carrots with a smile on her face, humming to herself. You looked at her with a face of disbelief. She noticed and said &quot;Oh, let them be. They&#39;re young and at that age.&quot; as she nudged you in the side. <br />
<br />
As you kept making lunch, you couldn&#39;t help glance over at your &#39;wife&#39; and her cleavage. The large tits swaying as she now peeled potatoes. You also caught her stealing glances at your forearms. You decided to ask her about it. &quot;Is there something on my arms? You keep looking at them&quot; You said. &quot;Oh, nothing, they&#39;re just so... masculine.&quot; she answered with a flirty tone. A chill ran over your body. Not only because she was being flirty with you and the disturbing implications of that. But also because... you liked it? For some reason, you decided to be flirty back. &quot;Oh, really? Maybe I need to hid them away then&quot; you said as you slowly rolled one of your sleeves down. &quot;No, stop it, you tease&quot; Cathy said with a giggle as she bumped her hip against yours. This back and forth kept going for a while, until Mariah entered the kitchen. &quot;What are you two looking so happy about?&quot; She asked. Both of you stopped dead in your tracks and answered &quot;nothing&quot; in unison and with that, the flirting was put to an end. Afterwards, you couldn&#39;t help but feel incredibly weird about what you had just done. By the looks of it, Cathy was feeling the same way. No wonder. Just because you were now husband and wife it did not excuse your actions.<br />
<br />
You sat in silence as you had lunch, feeling ashamed.</p>
