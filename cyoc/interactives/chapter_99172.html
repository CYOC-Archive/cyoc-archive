<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Leslie, what the fuck are you doing in my room? &quot;  yelled Elizabeth, as she put her hands on her hips and glared at her. Jeff wiggled around her massive body, and entered the room, standing slightly in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too late, &quot; said Leslie with smile.  &quot;It&#39;s already started!  You can&#39;t stop it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff saw the computer on, and the program running.  He quickly realized what was going on.  Les was trying to change something.  He prayed it wasn&#39;t him or Elizabeth. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see about that, &quot; said Jeff, as he jumped into the desk chair, trying to read the computer screen to see what she had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; screamed Les, as she brought both of her fists down on the computer as hard as she could. The computer monitor exploded in a spark and a flash, sending small shards flying in all directions.  She didn&#39;t know if the computer was able to complete its task, but she couldn&#39;t let them try to reverse her program.  This was her one and only chance at true power. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth jumped back as the computer exploded.  It had taken her a little longer than Jeff, but now she knew what Leslie had been doing.  And it really pissed her off.  The girl looked pretty beefy, and Liz was not looking forward to a tussle with her, even if she had the height advantage.  But the girl had invaded her home - her private room even - and destroyed their property.  She was furious, and she was going to take it out of Leslie&#39;s hide.  She charged towards Les.<br />
<br />
Les saw the look in Elizabeth&#39;s face, and knew she was in trouble.  She was more than pissed - she looked like a raging animal! Les did the only thing she could think of to defend herself.  She grabbed Jeff, still sitting dazed nearby at the smashed computer, and pulled him in front of her like a shield.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay back, or the little guy gets hurt, &quot; she said shakily.  She held Jeff one arm around his waist, pulling him closely against her body, and the other around his neck.  He was pretty small, compared to her, and she could get her hand around his entire neck.  One quick squeeze, and it would be all over.  She was bluffing, of course.  She was no killer.  But she hoped that Elizabeth would believe her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth stopped charging, but her gaze was still full of venom.  She understood the implications of Leslie&#39;s hold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go of my brother, &quot; she said, through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, but you have to let me out of here first, &quot; she said nervously, still gripping Jeff tightly. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth shook her head.  &quot;No way.  You aren&#39;t getting past me with him, &quot; she said, standing to her full height, placing her hands on her hips and blocking the door.  &quot;Let him go, then we can talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leslie was starting to panic now.  She knew she couldn&#39;t&#39; get past Elizabeth and out the door while holding Jeff.  But if she let him go, she knew she was in for a beating.  Her body felt strange, but she didn&#39;t know if it was the device or her fear.  Even if she was changing, it would take 1 hour to complete. She couldn&#39;t keep Elizabeth at bay for that long.  She looked around the room for another escape.  <br />
<br />
She saw a large window, leading to the outside.  She knew she on the second floor, but she didn&#39;t think she had another option.  She let go of Jeff&#39;s waist, then grabbed the desk chair with her free arm, and threw it out the window.  Before Elizabeth could react, she jumped out the window with Jeff in her arms, cutting her shoulders on the jagged glass.  She landed with a thud on the grass below.  Her legs ached, and she was afraid she had broken her ankle.  <br />
<br />
They shoot horses with broken legs, she thought dully.  She stood up on her hooves, and was happy to see that at least she could bear weight on it.  She dusted the grass and glass off of her body, grabbed Jeff, and limped off into the nearby woods.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth cursed.  She didn&#39;t dare follow Les out the window.  She knew enough about horses to know that was a bad idea. But she had to go rescue Jeff. She ran back down the stairs, and out the front door, trying to track them through the forest. <br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t too worried about the computer.  She had gotten what she wanted out of it, and Jeff was back to normal.  It might be a problem for Brittany and Cindy, though.  She guessed they were stuck as anthro-horses like her.  <br />
<br />
Maybe because Brittany is an anthro-horse it will be popular, she thought.  She had no idea what Leslie had been trying to do with the program. She guessed that Leslie was trying to turn herself back to normal. Whatever she was doing, it seemed like it didn&#39;t work.  Everyone in the room - Les, Elizabeth, and Jeff - all looked the same.  <br />
<br />
She must have destroyed the computer before it could complete whatever it was she was trying to do, she thought.  Thank God!  That girl is really weird. God only knows what she would do with that kind of power.<br />
<br />
Because the computer screen was destroyed before she could read it, Elizabeth had no idea that it would take 1 hour for Leslies&#39; change to complete, and that her transformation was just beginning.</p>
