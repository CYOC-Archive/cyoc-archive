<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lady Odayakana was making her way towards Chisai&#39;s blacksmith shop again for the third day in a row. The last two days she had gone by there, Chisai would claim that he was still working on orders for other swords, but still in the process of making a new blade for her.<br />
<br />
Odayakana wasn&#39;t sure, but she had a slight suspicion that Chisai maybe delaying the repairs for reasons that still weren&#39;t clear to her. She had remembered that Chisai&#39;s sisters and sister in-law seemed to answer a little more for him than he did on the day she brought her sword in for a repair. Still, she did like the small talks the two had been having while she visited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odayakana!&quot; A female voice called out from behind her. Turning she could see Kari running towards her with a smile and a wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohay&#333; Kari, how are you doing today?&quot; Odayakana greeted politely nodding towards her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m well thank you for asking. My siblings and moms are a little busy today and I was free so I had some time to hang out with you. Are you going to my uncle&#39;s shop again?&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was going to see how the progress on my family&#39;s sword is going. Your uncle is certainly a fine blacksmith, but he does seem to take his time with crafting a new blade.&quot; Odayakana commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chisai has told me in the past that you need to have the right time and patience to make a good blade.&quot; Kari said to Odayakana as the two headed towards Chisai&#39;s shop. As they entered they could see the five tailed kitsune hard at work. Grime coated his fur as he brought his hammer down on a red hot blade. Inwardly, Kari sighed, coated in grime from the forge wasn&#39;t the best way to make an impression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Uncle Chisai, how are you today?&quot; Kari politely greeted as he had his back turned towards the two and didn&#39;t realize Odayakana was with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello Kari. I&#39;m well, still working on another sword. Lady Odaykana&#39;s sword is still coming along, but I think I need her opinion on a few matters before I get back to work on it.&quot; Chisai said casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem.&quot; Odayakana said clearing her throat surprising Chisai who turned around to see her and in the process of quickly turning around, he accidentally made some hot coal fall onto the floor right near his toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Chisai shouted in slight pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle!&quot; Kari cried out. &quot;Master Chisai!&quot; Odayakana also cried out in slight worry as they both rushed over to Chisai&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn. That&#39;s the first time that&#39;s happened in quite a while to me.&quot; Chisai chuckled while wincing in slight pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kari, fill up that little bucket of water for my toes to soak in for a moment.&quot; Chisai instructed as Kari nodded and went to fill up the bucket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chisai, I am SO sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to startle you.&quot; Odayakana apologized bowing her head in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, Odayakana, it&#39;s not your fault, it&#39;s mine. Frankly, I&#39;m glad Kari came with you, Haley might have made me spill more coal.&quot; Chisai said as Odayakana slightly chuckled at Chisai&#39;s remark.<br />
<br />
Kari brought over the bucket of water sat it down by Chisai&#39;s toes allowing him to soak in the cooling water for a moment and the relief of the pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Chisai, I still feel very sorry for my action. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?&quot; Odayakana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, actually, now that you mention it. Going back to my earlier question about your sword, I wondered, did you have a preferred choice for your blade? There&#39;s the Shinogi-Zukuri, which is what your family&#39;s blade originally was. But I also considered making it a Hira-Zukuri, and there was also a popular one of the Kiriha-Zukuri choice that many of my customers usually prefer.&quot; Chisai said showing Odayakana the blades on a nearby crafting table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, I...I don&#39;t know. But I think my ancestors would prefer that our family&#39;s blade not change at all.&quot; Odayakana finally answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable.&quot; Chisai replied as he soaked his toes in the bucket of water a little longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be quite the master swordsman if you&#39;ve crafted so many swords.&quot; Odayakana complimented seeing all the swords he had been working on and the ones he hadn&#39;t gotten to yet including her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well.....actually, I&#39;m not really much of a swordsman. I&#39;m just the humble blacksmith with royal ties.&quot; Chisai said rubbing his neck in slight embarrassment. &quot;Although, I can swing a mean looking Warhammer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a swordsman? I am surprised. My own father made sure I knew the ways of and history of our family&#39;s blade.&quot; Odayakana admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, when your father is Lord Tatsu, he should probably know that not every son is going to be a great swordsman like Fukushu, but I on the on the other hand have something my brother doesn&#39;t have.&quot; Chisai said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would that be?&quot; Odayakana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A cheerful personality.&quot; Chisai answered with a smile as Odayakana and Kari giggled at that answer.<br />
<br />
After the laughing had settled, Chisai checked his toes to see that they looked much better and stood up to go work on Odayakana&#39;s sword. Odayakana noticed a slight limp in his walk and went over to help him get over to his crafting table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, but I should be okay now.&quot; Chisai said thanking Odayakana.<br />
<br />
Chisai decided to start repairing Odayakana&#39;s blade by taking of the old blade. Kari and Odayakana watched the process as Chisai removed the megs that were used to secure the handle of the sword. He then removed the handle of the blade followed by the fittings. Watching the process felt a little sad to Odayakana as she watched her family&#39;s sword be disassembled. Chisai now began to forge the new blade for Odayakana&#39;s sword as she became greatly fascinated by the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does the process work?&quot; Odayakana asked Chisai.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well once the blade&#39;s chosen, I heat it up, then I shape the blade by hammering it on my anvil over there.&quot; Chisai explained as he began to do just that.<br />
<br />
Odayakana would say that she would be watching her family&#39;s sword be remade, but a small part of her was also watching Chisai do his magic. Even she would have to admit that he certainly had the muscles to make so many blades over so many years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now after I cool it down,&quot; Chisai said as he plunged the blade into some water. &quot;the blade will harden. Then I&#39;ll reheat it to a lower temperature and cooled, that way it will reduce brittleness as well as restore ductility and durability for the blade.&quot; Chisai finished explaining as he did that very thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is quite fascinating. Listen Master Chisai...&quot; Odayakana began.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright for you to just call me Chisai, that is if I may just call you Odayakana.&quot; Chisai said with a smile as Odayakana blushed a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um....yes, I...I am sorry for earlier. Is there a way I might be able to make it up to you?&quot; Odayakana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.....uh....maybe. That is if you feel you would like to, I....would be honored if I might....uh....take....take you out on.....a date?&quot; Chisai hesitantly asked as his own face became as red as the heat he worked with.<br />
<br />
Odayakana&#39;s face equally became as red as she thought about the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is....uh....&quot; Odayakana looked to see Kari nodding and giving her a thumbs up to her friend to push her into agreeing. &quot;I would be most honored to....go out with you on a date Chisai, would tomorrow night work out well?&quot; Odayakana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would, I very much look forward to it Odayakana.&quot; Chisai said as he politely bowed towards her as did she and she now left with Kari.</p>
