<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeremy lay on the ground he could hear very well two people calling a name. His ears itched as did his skin and he dreaded to know what he had touched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nathan, Nathan, called the people as they walked closer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy decided it was better for him to get up rather than to explain his upcoming changes. Jogging across the pasture he approached a driveway which led to the highway or the farm house.<br />
<br />
The highway and home sounded better, so he turned left down the drive. Just before the road was a small lighted sign facing the road. Jeremy bent over it and read: &quot;Pureblood shire horse&#39;s Nathan # 1. Sire of champion&#39;s&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the sign he remembered the people in the pasture calling for Nathan. Jeremy felt more itchy feeling as he scratched his ears all facts came into view.<br />
<br />
His ears were large, furry, and extended from above of his furry head. Although very dark on a new moon night, Jeremy put out his hand into the light of the sign.<br />
<br />
Very reddish fur covered his arm and hand. Fingers were all but gone as they fused into hooves. A feeling of tightness in his shirt and pants warned him of other changes occuring.<br />
<br />
He realized that noway could he run or walk the miles back to home. As he turned to look back at the farm he tripped over his new hooves and fell to the ground. As he hit buttons popped off his shirt. A equine barrel chest of great strength bulged out.<br />
<br />
Squirming around he removed the shirt and wiggled his hoofed hands to remove pants and underwear. He was naked, yes, but he quickly was being covered in red and white fur giving him an odd feeling.<br />
<br />
Gathering up his clothing he hid them under a honeysuckle bush. Turning around he heard the sound of people coming down the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw something like a pony or so, I&#39;m sure I did. It might be one of ours as a runaway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear, you could shot him with another stinger dart like you brought down Nathan, poor horse, he&#39;ll have a headache from that stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy sat under the bush till finally the two people walked back to the farm house. &quot;Wow, that was close!&quot; he thought. Then as if to try something Jeremy tried to speak. &quot;Neigh~!, he took a deep breath and tried again, neiiiigh~!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s speach ability was all equine. He tried to push himself up on two feet. Try as he might the only way to move was now on all fours. Standing he looked left then right and left again. His arms now forelegs and legs now hind legs. He saw his belly and flanks as being that of a young horse.<br />
<br />
Jeremy strolled about along the grass next to the paved driveway. As final changes worked the wonder of this body into his thoughts he felt quiet calm.<br />
<br />
A calm feeling of acceptance in becoming a shire horse. A swinging tail which twitched both from habit and sensual thrills. The feeling of hooves pressing into soft turf produced a bounciness in his steps. Sniffing and snorting proved to have a strange feel too! Yet in the depths of his mind, he kept desiring the simple touch from his brother that could bring him back to a young human male.<br />
<br />
Now as a horse, his sense of smell began it&#39;s attack on Jeremy&#39;s intellect, nature proved to be intoxicating. His prime instincts made him to pee and shit freely in the pasture. He knew he would die of embarrassment if he do things like those as a human, but now he was a horse and he didn&#39;t mind too much about it.<br />
<br />
As the light of day showed to all a beautiful stud along the drive of the farm entrance, it wasn&#39;t long before a man approached with a halter and rein. His horse instincts told him to run away, to be free but for some reason he also had a feeling of belongings with this man. So, he didn&#39;t fight and as a docile creature the halter snugged down over his face.<br />
<br />
An imposing yet friendly horse&#39;s neigh as he was dragged away from the nature to a stable. He was losing his freedom. However, he didn&#39;t tug back. The driveway was also wet and offered little traction for his hooves. He was now walking alongside the farmer who he knew would take good care of him. Memories were short now and Jeremy was fast losing his identity to that of a horse.<br />
<br />
A shove of one big boot to his hairy rump pushed Jeremy past the gate and into a stable filled with a variety of mares. As he wandered about the mares plodded this way and that. Jeremy felt a need to mate that was strange and mixed with an increasing heat. As he moved around the mares also noticed him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a thought, or at least an instinctive move as Jeremy jumped over the nearest mare. His new sheath making contact with her moist black vag. A sudden slurping sound echoed through the room as his new horsehood penetrated her and started to fuck her in a increasingly feral way. As his horse self took more and more controls over the body movements, he found his human will and desires pressed deeper into a degrading brain.<br />
<br />
Now Jeremy had to hang there in blank stare and watch through a blurred sight the world around him. The instincts of a stud for mating drove the movement of his body. He felt the equine desires chipping away at his thought patterns. Soon the youth Jeremy will accept the horse form and life. With his last bit of humanity he wondered if he&#39;d ever be human again?</p>
