<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well practice makes perfect Auntie Becca!&quot; Candice cheerfully chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I do suppose you&#39;re right...&quot; She agreed, lifting the camera up.<br />
<br />
Paul froze. He could protest, but as a young girl, it wasn&#39;t like anyone was going to take him seriously, hell he didn&#39;t even take himself seriously. He braced himself, hoping nothing could get any worse, because at this point there was nothing stopping his &quot;mother&quot; from screwing things up even more.<br />
<br />
Becca hummed, adjusting her aim and pressing random buttons and twisting dials in an attempt to work it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... Honey, you sure you know what you&#39;re doing...?&quot; Oliver asked, nudging Emile with his elbow as the two snickered. Becca huffed and maintained composure as she swiftly turned to her husband, camera level with him. Paul held his breath as he worried what could happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;I <I>believe</I> I do, darling, why the nerve! This camera has been in our family for years now! I think I know what I&#39;m doing!&quot; She said, twisting back and looking around for a muse to immortalize in the magical camera. Paul sighed, catching his breath for a moment.<br />
<br />
While the &quot;cousins&quot; and &quot;aunt&quot; were too busy waiting for Becca to take a shot, Paul attempted to strategize what he could do in the meantime. He could try to talk to Emile, but he&#39;d have to move from his spot on the blanket, and Emile wasn&#39;t apparently aware he wasn&#39;t meant to be a boy in this version of the family, not to mention his own wife thinks she&#39;s a real macho man with muscles bigger than his head. Paul frustratedly sighed, things were not going well, things were not going well at all.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Becca frowned, closing one eye and attempting to figure out what she could use to take a photo of to prove to her family that she could do this. ...Not that she was an avid photographer, lord knows she hated the idea of it, but the idea of making everyone know and praise her would be so much better than the numerous awful family photos they&#39;ve had before. She had settled on a bird bath, but the blue bird had flown off, earning a haughty scoff.<br />
<br />
The flowers nearby proved to be a good selection, but her focus was immediately drawn to a young couple strolling by, eagerly hand in hand and giggling. The young man had brown hair, an average build, and a forest green shirt and blue jeans, while the woman had black hair and glasses, though she was a fair bit chunkier and had dressed in an adequate yoga pants and gym shirt. The sight melted her heart, recalling days she and Oliver would date and how wonderful and dashing he was. How his ample chest could hardly be contained by his V neck shirt, or how he was so love struck when Becca managed to-<br />
<br />
&quot;So, sis, you gonna take the shot? Or should we get dinner without you?&quot; Alex jabbed, gaining the chuckles of the rest of the family members save Paula. <br />
<br />
Becca groaned, she hated when her sister popped her bubble, but she was right, the longer she tried to prolong this thing, the more foolish she would look.<br />
<br />
Taking it in stride, Becca motioned the camera up and just as the couple had laughed and created the perfect photo, Becca clicked the button and a strong flash bursted out into the park. Blinking and wiping her eyes, Becca looked down as the photo took a second to develop, Paula gasping.<br />
<br />
A young mother, with shoulder length brown hair dressed in a yellow floral dress was lovingly caressing her engorged stomach, walking ever so patiently by. Her cheeks were slightly puffy, and she had seemed a bit out of breath, but Becca felt an unusual kinship with the woman, it had been a long while since she was pregnant too, but she could understand that every woman had felt a sisterly bond with those in the joys of child rearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, let&#39;s see, what&#39;d you get!&quot; Alex jived, gesturing to Becca to pass her the camera.<br />
<br />
Shaking herself out of the trance, Becca turned and displayed the camera for all to see. <br />
<br />
&quot;See? A beautiful mother enjoying a park stroll.&quot; She said confidently, to her husband&#39;s chuckle. Sure, she was hamming up the museum speak, but it was a moment she could be proud of.<br />
<br />
Alex soon joined his laugh, pointing to the picture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you might wanna try again sis, that photo&#39;s a bit blurry... Wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot; <br />
<br />
Becca snapped to attention, gawking at the photo. She was sure it was as clear as day, but, just as her sister acknowledged, the photo was slightly blurry. It was of good quality but, not the kind to truly impress anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it can&#39;t be helped, after all, it&#39;s not like we were a family of photographers.&quot; Alex chided, Paula strangely sighing along with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, watch and see, I&#39;ll get this yet!&quot; Becca proudly stated, pulling up the camera once again to her eye and focusing onto the woman walking by. Thankfully, she hadn&#39;t noticed her or the attention she was receiving, which was perfect: The best pictures are the most natural ones.<br />
<br />
With a click of the button, Becca eagerly embraced the large flash again, this time relishing and waiting with anticipation the treasure developing from the camera. Oliver let out a low whistle as the picture developed: A bulging adonis with muscles that could rival himself was displayed, confidently striding in a black loose tank top that gave a more than generous view of his bouncing pectorals and cannonball deltoids. He had on white wireless headphones and had a well trimmed brown beard with a wavy undercut, with tree trunk thighs wrapped in tight running shorts. He was jogging past the family, turning his head and making an arrogant wink at Becca and Alex and made his way down the road. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think that settles <I>that</I>.&quot; Alex said, sensually, Becca felt her cheeks heat up. &quot;Think you got competition, Oliver?&quot; She gestured, who had raised his eyebrows already.<br />
<br />
Oliver chuckled, before rolling his sleeves up and flexing an impressive bicep, not unlike the jogging man who had passed them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never, my wife may know what she likes... But I think I&#39;m more than man enough for her, right baby?&quot; He said, coming forward and holding his wife from behind. Becca chuckled anxiously, just as the children voiced their displeasure with a few &quot;gross!&quot; and &quot;Ughhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Still laughing, Oliver clapped his hands together and rubbed them vigorously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say I&#39;m starting to get hungry, what about you guys?&quot; He declared, to the cheer of the teens and Paula. &quot;Alright! Food&#39;s on me!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the children got up, Becca reached into her purse and offered Oliver the necessary cash they&#39;d need to buy hot dogs or ice cream. It wasn&#39;t bad, but having children with her dream man was so worth it. He gave her a courteous peck on the cheek and left with them in tow, the teenagers following on their pace as Oliver picked up Paula (much to her surprise) and held her on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda crazy things are like this, huh?&quot; Alex prodded. Becca sighed, still clutching the camera tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; She agreed, watching things play out so well. Suddenly, she could feel the urge to take another picture welling up inside her again, and so...</p>
