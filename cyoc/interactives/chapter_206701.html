<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Where the hell is that report?!” grumbled a lanky old man in a fancy suit, as he drummed his fingers impatiently upon a lavish mahogany desk. It was well past noon and there was still no sign of the report, how was he going to impress his investors without it? He looked at the bespectacled young man standing in front of his desk as he studied the tablet he held. The man looked up and shook his head in the negative, further annoying the old man. “If Perkins doesn&#39;t send me that damned file within the next ten minutes, he&#39;s fired!”<br />
“Understood, Mr. Edwin. I&#39;ll prepare the letter of dismissal and look for a replacement.” spoke the man, Dawkins. Now here&#39;s a fellow that has his shit in order, mused Mr. Edwin, one of the corners of his mouth curling into a smile. Smart, diligent, responsible and always efficient, his assistant Dawkins, a young man in his late twenties, he was his finest employee. Why, if he could get a hundred of people like him, he&#39;d have fired the rest of the workforce in a snap.<br />
“Dawkins, my boy, after the shareholders&#39; meeting tomorrow, you, me, and miss Dupont, we&#39;re gonna pay a visit to my buddy&#39;s golf resort. We could use the downtime there, heh heh.” Dawkins raised his head and gazed at his superior, an earnest smile adorning his face. Goddamn, even his smile is like a pro, the old businessman chuckled to himself. <br />
“Thank you, sir.” the younger man replied, bowing his head politely.<br />
The moment was short-lived when the phone suddenly rang, Mr. Edwin picking up the speaker. “Yes, miss Dupont?”<br />
“Sir, I have the head of security, Mr. Fergus, on the line, he- he said he needed to speak with you, urgently.”  the senior businessman frowned, she sounded a bit frantic over the phone. “We, uh, have a situation.”<br />
“Well, put him through.” he grumbled. Soon, a gruff voice spoke through, and he raised an eyebrow at the noisy commotion happening in the background, it almost sounded like... howling? <br />
“Sir, you need to get to the rooftop, it&#39;s all gone to hell down here!” <br />
“Fergus, what is the meaning of this?” Mr. Edwin shouted, Dawkins looking at him with a grave expression. “The rooftop? Wha-”<br />
“Man, if you seen this shiet... they&#39;re turning everyone! Me and the Ivan twins are locked up in the security room, we barricaded the doors, but those things are trying to force their way through!” more shouting and howling could be heard in the background, as well as banging noises, Fergus raising his own voice in order to be heard. “They&#39;re going through every floor, Mr. Edwin, you have to get out of here, NOW!!”<br />
There was a crunch, followed by more incoherent screams, and then the line went dead.<br />
“Sir, is something the matter?” asked Dawkins, noticing the pale expression on his boss&#39; face. Taking in a long breath, Phineas Edwin settled the speaker down, and looked at his assistant.<br />
“We have to leave the building, it sounded really bad over the phone.” but just as he stood up, there was a thump on the doors to his office, followed the beeping sound after a keycard is slid into the sensor and the doors opened, a disheveled woman wearing a suit and skirt entering and slamming the door shut. She looked flushed, and there was a sticky substance on her lips and face, as she leaned her back to the door amd gently slid down to the floor. “Miss Dupont, you look like a mess! What happened... to... you...” his words died as he saw her convulse, her groans growing wilder and louder.<br />
“Sssir, y-you need to... hnnngh, to GET out, hmmm- while you still CAN.” she muttered in between grunts, shuddering. Dawkins moved to help her, while the older man began to move away from his desk and towards a corner of the wall. They both froze when the woman&#39;s figure softened and began straining her clothes. Her blouse struggled to contain a swelling bosom as she panted, and the waist band of her skirt popped open to reveal a gut that not too long ago had been svelte.<br />
“What the-” was all that came out of Dawkins&#39; mouth before the blouse burst open and buttons flew outward, one narrowly flying past his face as he followed its trajectory. In doing so he saw his boss open a panel and input a code on the keypad, revealing a hidden door on the wall. “Sir? What is th-” the bespectacled man asked.<br />
“Dawkins, MOVE!” Mr. Edwin beckoned, but just as the former was about to, an intense moan and a tearing noise drew both of their attention to the woman. She was a lot fatter, her clothes shredding to make way for the flab that poured through. To top it off, patches of fur were sprouting on her skin, her face was stretching into a muzzle and her teeth were becoming sharper. With a grunt, she propped herself back up, causing her bloated figure to jiggle and shake, and viciously tore the remains of her shredded clothes off along with her underwear. Now fully in the nude, she leered at Dawkins, a long tongue rolling off her canine mouth. He paled when two lumps formed on her shoulders, manifesting into two extra heads, grinning and drooling in a lurid fashion. Not only that, but she absolutely TOWERED over him, standing taller than him by a full foot at 8&#39;ft. He took a step back, only to hear a door close behind him.<br />
Mr. Edwin was nowhere to be seen, and the hidden door had been shut closed. Dawkins felt a wave of anger rush him, but it quickly faded when he felt a heavy paw on his shoulder.<br />
“Oh, Michael...” spoke miss Dupont&#39;s left head in a honeyed voice, just oozing of pent-up arousal, as she gently applied pressure. &quot;You&#39;re not thinking of leaving lil&#39; ol&#39; me like this, are you, you naughty man?”<br />
“N-Now now, miss Dupont...” Dawkins stuttered, a fearful smile plastered on his face. Surely, if she was still capable of speech, she wasn&#39;t all monster? Surely, she can still be reasoned with, and he could get out of this relatively unscathed. “Le-let&#39;s just t-talk this over, like civilized folks-” all three heads chuckled at that, with the right head craning her neck towards him.<br />
“You misunderstand, Mr. Dawkins, I&#39;m not going to eat you or anything...” she said, the other two smiling in agreement. “You see, for the longest time, I&#39;ve had my eyes on you.” her middle head licked her lips in anticipation.<br />
“Re-really? I don&#39;t suppose I did something to offend you?” he asked, as she placed her other paw on his free shoulder. Giggling, she pressed her prodigious gut onto his athletic frame along with her bare furry boobs onto his face, distorting his glasses.<br />
“A gentleman like you, offend me? Oh, darling...” her middle head chuckled as he struggled to pull away from her cleavage. He put his hands on her soft middle, trying to push away, but her grip remained strong. She did give a little leeway, enough for him to crane his neck to look upwards to her three heads. “And, Michael? Call me Clarisse.” she cooed, and suddenly all three heads leaned forward towards his own.<br />
Michael Dawkins couldn&#39;t see anything other than fur, lips, tongues and teeth, as his face was kissed, licked, drooled on, and rubbed by the Cerberus woman. He was being assaulted by this monster of a woman that not too long ago had been the secretary of his coward of a boss, and yet, he couldn&#39;t muster the strength to resist her advances, it was fading away, just like his anger towards the old geezer&#39;s escape. Why was that, a little part of his mind asked itself.<br />
The answer was evident on his physique, as he quickly found his suit getting tighter and tighter. He felt bloated, but not only that, he felt EXTREMELY aroused. Clarisse&#39;s three heads pulled back, smiling at their effort: the man&#39;s face had morphed into a canine muzzle, his glasses having fallen off during the (brief) struggle. Still gripping him by the shoulders, she could only admire the metamorphosis he was undergoing: his height shot up, and soon, he stood at eye level with her; his broad shoulders softened up, as fat piled onto his arms and gave him a set of bingo wings; his hips flared out and filled out, becoming more feminine in shape; his six-pack was buried under a paunch that squished against hers, eliciting a wave of arousal that coursed through the two of them; his chiseled chest ballooned into two bouncy breasts, that jiggled at the faintest tremor; and two lumps swelled and morphed into copies of his canine face. Michael, no, MICHELLE, was only vaguely aware of everything that was transpiring.<br />
Clarisse felt a jolt in her nethers as she beheld the newly-transformed Cerberus woman before her, and three thoughts coursed through her three heads: Michelle was absolutely sexy/lovely/adorable, and Clarisse just had to make her her own.<br />
Taking her by her hands, Clarisse lead her towards and pushed her onto Mr. Edwin&#39;s luxurious desk, which groaned under the immense weight the new woman sported. Michelle for her part, was too dazed and horny to protest, so she just went along with her counterpart. Even as her plush legs were parted and her belly was lifted, all Michelle did was admire her new tits and play with them, a bit oblivious to what Clarisse&#39;s three heads were about to do to her newly-formed and very moist pussy... Or that the doors to the office were violently opened as a crowd of similarly super-sized three-headed canine women stormed through... Oh.<br />
“Hiii...” Michelle waved drunkenly to the the newcomers, happy when they waved back in kind and came closer...<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mr. Edwin frantically made his way to the rooftop through the hidden passage, where his own private helicopter would be soon landing to take him away from the doomed building.<br />
“Fucking... hell...” was all he could mutter as he ran.</p>
