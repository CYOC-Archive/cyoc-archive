<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’m leaving you in charge of the ring because I know you’ll enjoy this more than I will,” you state, Skylar smiles back excitedly. You hand her the ring, she quickly slips it onto her finger.<br />
You and Skylar had just enjoyed a quick mini-date at the best burger joint in town, Burger-Barn. Skylar loved eating there since she knew she would never gain any additional weight due to her ‘never gain weight from eating junk food’ wish. you still pointed out that this counteracted your rules… but sometimes you just liked to see her happy. You always let it slide.<br />
<br />
“So first wish; I wish that the ring isn’t removable from my finger,” Skylar starts with the basic, “now, I wish that when we’ve decided that we’ve finished, everyone we want to forget about us will just go home, forget about the ring and any magic, excluding Yu and myself,” she finishes,<br />
“Perfect!” You say happily, giving Skylar a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
You both make your way down to the park. Obviously, you both stay cautious with the sun down and it being pretty late, but as far as you can see, the only people in/around the park are teenagers. Perfect for your ‘mission’.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Skylar says, quickly stopping. Admittedly, this does startle you a little bit, “I wish that I can make wishes by snapping my fingers, not having to say anything out loud!”<br />
“Hey wait,” you say, “isn’t that against our rules?” You say,<br />
“Yeah,” she says, shrugging, “I made that rule,” she says, beginning to walk again, you stop her,<br />
“And?” You ask, “why’d you break it?” You ask again,<br />
“Because if I make a wish, I don’t wanna have to say it all out loud,” she states, “I’ll undo the wish after we’re done with this, I promise,” she says. You watch as the ring shimmers after she says this, you’re inclined to believe her.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
“Hey!” A boy shouts at you and Skylar as you approach the park. He’s in a group, three girls, two boys. They don’t appear to be doing anything aside from hanging out, thank god, “who’re you?” He asks, standing up and approaching you and Skylar. Before you can say anything,<br />
“Let’s not make a big deal out of this,” Skylar starts, making him slow down. Skylar is in front of you,<br />
“Do you want something?” The red haired girl asked, she was sitting down,<br />
“No. I’m wondering if any of you want something,” she states. You weren’t expecting her to be so forward with this, “in fact, name anything. I’ll give it to you,”<br />
“Name anything?” The blonde girl asked, who was sitting next to the red haired girl, and the other boy. He also had blonde hair,<br />
“Anything you desire,” Skylar says, “I will make it happen,”<br />
“Anything I want?” The boy says, snickering, turning to look at his friends before turning back. He locked eyes with you, you can already tell he likes trouble, “what if I wanted a ten thousand bucks!” He remarks, his friends all giggling from behind. Skylar turns to you, smirking. She snaps her fingers, suddenly, in the palm of the boys hand, ten thousand dollars starts appearing. Note by note, the stack increases until it’s as thick as a book, even a little ‘$10,000’ ribbon covers it. You smirk at Skylar’s creativity.<br />
<br />
The teens look shocked. From what you can tell, they’re only a little younger than you and Skylar (who are around 18), making them about 16-17 years old. They don’t look like the coolest group, but they’re sure as hell not a nerdy bunch.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!!” The main kid shrieks, he looks at the money in his hands, “I’m rich!!” He says. Suddenly, the red haired girl stands up, she walks over and says,<br />
“Give me that, Henry!” She says, snatching it out of his hand, looking at it closely,<br />
“Rebecca! Stop being such a bitch!” He tries to snatch it back, but she evades him,<br />
“Holy shit, this is real!” Rebecca says, throwing the money to the blonde haired girl,<br />
“Wow!” The blonde haired girl says, looking at it, “I don’t think I’ve ever even held this much money!” She says,<br />
“Give it here, sis!” The blonde haired boy says, trying to grab it off her,<br />
“Get off me, Jamie!” She cries back,<br />
Finally, the black haired girl snatches it off of them both, she stands up and walks away so no one can take it from her,<br />
“Lexi!!” They all cry together.<br />
“Hey!” Lexi shouts back at them, “stop fighting over the money,”<br />
“Morgan started it,” Jamie says about his twin sister,<br />
“You bitch!” Morgan shouts at him,<br />
<br />
“I wish we all had ten thousand dollars!!!” Rebecca shouts, stopping everyone in their tracks,<br />
“Finally,” Skylar says. She snaps her fingers. Just like that, everyone sees a stack of ten thousand dollars in their hands. Everyone but Lexi, but she already had a stack in her hands.<br />
<br />
“So this chick really grants wishes?” Henry asks,<br />
“Don’t call her a chick!” Rebecca says angrily at him,<br />
“Sorry,” he says sarcastically. Then an idea sparks in his head, “I wish my girlfriend had bigger boobs!” He says. Skylar smirks, she was looking forward to this.<br />
<br />
“What!?” Rebecca shouts, but before she can react, Skylar snaps her fingers. Suddenly, her C cups burst from her bra, revealing two round double D’s, bouncing from their sudden jump,<br />
“Holy shit!!” Henry shouts, staring at Rebecca’s breasts, “those are amazing!”<br />
“Was it too much trouble to ask first?” Rebecca says, grabbing at her boobs to stop them bouncing so much,<br />
“Admit you like them,” Henry says, still staring at them,<br />
“Whatever!” Rebecca says, trying to hide them,<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Morgan shouted, “I want bigger boobs too!” She asked, Skylar was about to snap her fingers before her brother interrupted her,<br />
“I wish she has boobs the size of watermelons!!” He said to mess with his sister,<br />
“What the hell!?” She said, turning to grab her brother. But before she could, Skylar snapped her fingers. Suddenly, Morgan’s relatively small breasts bounced to the size of oranges, then melons, then even bigger, becoming watermelon sized. She almost toppled over with the rapid growth. Jamie couldn’t stop laughing at his sister.<br />
<br />
“Ugh!” Morgan screamed, grabbing at her breasts, barely able to touch her own nipples. Her shirt had stretched to almost breaking point, she looked at Morgan in spite, “I wish Jamie’s dick is 4 feet long!”<br />
“HUH!” Jamie shouted, he looked at Skylar with a smirk on her face, she snapped her fingers. Jamie felt a sensation in his cock, like it getting hard suddenly, but it kept on growing It grow until his bulge was getting too big for his jeans to handle. Lexi stared as her boyfriends cock got bigger and bigger, bursting out from his jeans. She saw his 4 foot long meat stand as straight as it could. Thicker, longer, juicier. It’s proportions were so unrealistic and odd, but she couldn’t help herself from being mesmerised by it, her lust was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is wrong with you!” Jamie shouted, trying to touch his cock but being overwhelmed with pleasure,<br />
“You made my tits ridiculously big!” She shouted back.<br />
<br />
“GUYS!!” Rebecca shouted. Everyone went silent, “we have infinite power and you’re ALL spending it on selfish things! We could be—”<br />
“Hell if I care!” Henry interupted,<br />
“Henry!!” Rebecca shouted at her boyfriend, really pissed,<br />
“I wish you had the body of a super huge sexy MILF!!” He said, looking at his girlfriend’s body, “and you’re totally obsessed with me!”<br />
“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?” Rebecca screamed as Skylar snapped her fingers.<br />
Suddenly, Rebecca’s figure shot up to at least 6 foot 2. Her hips flared out, her waist came in as she gained a number of pounds in some places, but lost them in the others. Her already big boobs grew another few sizes, finally breaking through her top. Her butt grew more bubbled and round, her thighs too. Her face matured, some of her red hair lightened with age.<br />
“This is SERIOUSLY out of—” she was about to scream down on her now shorter boyfriend, but instead was overcome with a wave of nothing but lust. Everything was forgotten, all she wanted was to be with Henry. She wasn’t Henry to be with her. She wanted Henry.<br />
<br />
She grabbed him, pushing him over to the point where she couldn’t hold back from making out with him,<br />
“Mmmm…” she moaned as she exchanged saliva with her boyfriend, taking her tongue out of his mouth to say, “I wish Henry has a super fit body with a massive, juicy cock!” She said, immediately back to making out with him. Skylar snapped her fingers.<br />
Henry’s somewhat scrawny body suddenly bulked up, making his shirt stain against his new, smooth muscles. His body became so much more toned, smooth, perfect. Even his jawline improved. Then, as she was waiting for, his cock broke right through his shorts at full hardness. They both moaned as they got closer and closer to having some kind of sex,<br />
“Ew!” Morgan said, “I wish they wouldn’t have sex!” She said without hesitation. Skylar snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Henry and Rebecca were throw apart like magnets. Henry got back up immediately, quickly running back to Rebecca to see if she was okay. But the moment he got near her, he was thrown backwards again, landing on the grass.<br />
“What the hell!” He yelled,<br />
“Yeah!” Rebecca yelled as well, lifting herself off the ground, “that was SO uncalled for!” She looked really pissed off, being prevented from being with her boyfriend, “You’re meant to be my best friend!”<br />
“Hey! I’m your best friend, not some weirdo watching you two get it on,”<br />
“Screw you!” Rebecca yelled, “I wish you were super FAT!!”<br />
