<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing Spenser, now kai, noticed when she stumbled from her room...still absently rubbing her sore and tender chest...was that her sister's room now had a sign that announced, 'Cala's Room' instead of 'Heather's Room'.<br />
<br />
Bothered by this, wondering if maybe her sudden shift in sex and gender had anything to do with this, Kai continued on toward the bathroom, realising what she was doing and forcing her hand to drop as she approached the room, noting as she did so that her sense of balance had shifted because of the way she rested on her feet and the tail that ejected forth from her tail bone.<br />
<br />
Inside, Kai closed the door and after a moment's thought, she locked it. Turning toward the mirror her mother had hung on the back of the door for Heather...though her thoughts told her that their mother had hung it for both Cala/Heather and Kai's use. Peering into the depths, she took in the round face, the height of what she thought was about four foot four and noticing the tail that was twitching back and forth every now and again.<br />
<br />
Running a hand through her strawberry blonde hair, she pushed it aside as she took in the holes in the ears and how her ears appeared to be just slightly rounder then a normal human's.<br />
<br />
Looking down, still coming to terms, she reached down and with a hesitant hand, she pushed down on the waist band of the pants. When they reached a certain point, Kai allowed them to slide down her smooth legs, liking the way they felt as they slid over her soft skin.<br />
<br />
Grasping the hem of the tank-top, she pulled up and for a moment the world disappeared as she pulled it up and over her shirt. Stepping forward, and pushing the pants back, she peered into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Reflected back was a girl that she knew to be about eleven years old. Smooth skin greeted her eyes and looking down at her crotch, Kai took in how smooth it appeared, but just had the hint of bulging out in the vulva as her body started the transition from girlhood to womanhood.<br />
<br />
Looking at her chest, she took in her areolas and the clear fact that she had breast buds. Touching them, she pulled her hand away as it became even more clear and evident just one how sore and tender they were.<br />
<br />
Reaching a hand between her legs, she touched her vulva, ran a finger over her clitoris and started to part her lips majour and minour, moving a finger toward her vagina, but stopped as the thought that what she was doing was inappropriate and rather naughty. Dropping her hand, she instead away from the mirror, the pressure on her bladder reminding her why she had come in here.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the toilet, part of Spenser surfaced and at first Kai was worried that she wouldn't know what to do and then she squashed that thought as she realised she had been using the toilet, like a girl, since she had been about three, when she had been potty trained.<br />
<br />
Finished, torn between liking the way her urine left her body and thinking that it was normal, Kai stood and moved toward the sink.<br />
<br />
After washing and drying her hands, she redressed and exited the bathroom, curious as to what else had changed, deciding the family albums where the best place to look, and starting downstairs toward the living room.<br />
<br />
Clicking on a light, she took one of the albums from the shelf and flicking through, noting her sister looked a little like her except for the lack of a tail and normal feet, Kai took in the many pictures of a happy, baby girl that also looked like she was part mouse. In several of the pictures where two other girls, who Kai recognised as Stacy and Linda, her two best friends since Kindergarten.<br />
<br />
Closing the album, she flicked through a couple more, taking in that they all had the same pictures of Cala and Kai growing up.<br />
<br />
Putting the albums back, she stood and looked about the room, noting that except for the pictures, nothing else had really changed. Clicking off the light, Kai exited the room and made her way back upstairs, deciding her bedroom would be another good place to look for changes.<br />
<br />
Inside her room, she clicked on the light and took in what appeared to her to be the normal room of a prepubescent girl. Hello Kitty sheets and a comforter covered the bed. A pink and purple lamp sat on the nightstand, which matched the dresser, vanity and bed making it a complete bedroom set. Pushing aside the comforter, Kai found the only two stuffed animals she ever had and setting Penny Penguin and the ten inch Angelina Ballerina on the nightstand, she moved toward the closet.<br />
<br />
Opening it, she found it full of dress in all sorts of bright colours and taking one down, Kai thought of how pretty she had looked wearing it when she had her school picture taken.<br />
<br />
Putting it back, she closed the door, noting that the box of girl stuff she had collected when she was still Spenser was missing. Shrugging, she peered around the room, taking in the specially made Ballet slippers on the vanity, the ribbons and trophies from different gymnastic competitions and after a moment, she sat down at her vanity.<br />
<br />
Going through the drawers, she found the odd assortment of tights, make-up, perfumes, hair ribbons and ties, and other whatnots that she knew she would find even before opening the first drawer.<br />
<br />
Peering at the dresser, she knew what the contents where and decided that there really was no point in opening it. Instead, she sat and tail twitching, she wondered what it was that had caused her to shift sex and gender...&quot;If what I remember is true and not some dream that I had,&quot; she thought as she looked about the room, taking in the various posters and pictures.<br />
<br />
A ringing noise interrupted her thoughts and suddenly she remembered that mom was out of town for a meeting, Cala was over at a friend’s house and that she had invited Linda and Stacy over for a sleep-over.<br />
<br />
Standing, she took another look around the room, still wondering which was the dream and which was reality, and clicking off the light, she went to answer the door, hoping that this was the reality and that she was indeed a girl and not some male that desperately wanted to be female.</p>
