<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Brianna continued to fuck for several hours. It was one of the benefits of having a titty with a long nipple for a dick. Jeff never once felt sore and had enough in him to last the entire time, as his boob just kept generating more and more milk from seemingly out of no where. The one down side was that his back was a little bit sore. Due to his milk, they had relocated to his bathtub, but the harder surface didn&#39;t do his back any favors, even if it did save his room from being ruined. <br />
<br />
Asside from the dull pain in his upper back. He felt surprisingly good. He tilted his hwad to the side and saw the cute sleeping face of Brianna next to him. He rolled over onto his side to face her, while being careful to not crush his boob in between his thighs in the process. She looked so peaceful next to him. &quot;Even your soft breathing is cute.&quot; Thought Jeff, as he went to brush a loose hair out of her face. However he only managed to rais his hand when he saw how his fingernails had all lengthened considerably. Now taking on a very feminine look. Each one extended about a quarter of an inch past his finger tips and looked as if they were expertly maintained. And did his hands also look a bit more delicate too?<br />
<br />
He wondered to himself what could have happened now. It hadn&#39;t been 3 days yet, so the chronivac shouldn&#39;t be operable quite yet. Maybe it was going through a reconfiguration process, and somehow was targeting him still? Jeff tested his other hand and sure enough, it felt similar to his right hand, long nails and all. Due to his movements, Brianna woke up, gently with a yawn. And when she opened her eyes, all she could do was chuckle to herself. &quot;Hehe, I didn&#39;t realize I fell in love with such a prankster. By the way, you look very pretty in fake eye lashes.&quot; Brianna commented sleepily. <br />
<br />
This woke Jeff up though. &quot;Brianna, I am not wearing fake eyelashes... I literally just woke up too. Something else must be going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianna yawned once more and sat up, not even bothering to cover herself with the blanket. Her boobs just hung freely out in the open for you to view. &quot;Seems like we both prefer to sleep naked too. Now, what is it that has gotten you so wound up?&quot; Jeff shows her his hands and her eyes widen in surprise. &quot;Okay, if I didn&#39;t know that you didn&#39;t have those nails 6 hours ago, I would be like really fucking jealous of you right now because that is a really good manicure. And also I want your eye lashes so badly now that I know that they aren&#39;t fakes. Hey, why did you suddenly get all of this incredible feminine beauty while I got jack shit?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I have a theory. But I need to explain some background information too. It also will explain my crotch boob too.&quot; Reluctantly said Jeff. He wanted to keep this a secret, but now he couldn&#39;t just keep lying to her face. So he told her everything about the chronivac, and how he somehow broke it, and that his default profile now has a crotch boob instead of his dick, etc... <br />
<br />
Brianna just listened to the stroy. Nornally this would be nonsense, but since she just fucked said crotch boob for several hours last night, so she couldn&#39;t really deny its legitimacy. &quot;Ok, so what? You think the device is turning you more and more feminine or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be my guEss&quot; Jeff replies, and even now his voice craked at the end of it, which only reinforced his suspicion. Suddenly a text message comes through on his phone from the developers. Jeff read it outloud so that Brianna could also know what it said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your scheduled maintenance began last night at midnight and is expected to be completed within the next 48 hours. Durring this period, expect random changes to occure based around the category of your most resent useage of the Chronivac to happen. All of these random changes are temporary and should be resolved by the time your scheduled maintenance is complete. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you are just becoming sporadically female at random. I think I can handle that for 2 days. I&#39;ve never dated a girl before, so maybe this could be really fun too!&quot; Brianna says optimistically. Jeff tried to agree but when he went to speak it felt like his throat was closing and he literally choked on his words for a second. After a bit of light coughing, he tried again. &quot;Well, at least we know... Huhhhh, I sound just like a girl now.&quot; His voice indeed sounded just like a young woman&#39;s now. Not too high pitched, and with an air of maturity mixed into it actually made him sound really sexy. Not that he wanted to sound like a sexy young woman, but at least he didn&#39;t sound like a 4 year old or something. &quot;Ooooh I love the new voice&quot; joked Brianna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it, I isn&#39;t like I wanted to sound like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually you did. Remember that it was you who chose the &#39;transgender&#39; category? Well, now you are slowly becomming a hot piece of sexy girl ass. Brianna said as she playfully spanked his ass, causing a cute sounding moan to escape from his lips invoulentarrily, much to his own embarrassment. This sudden outburst of Jeff&#39;s seemed to have awoken something in Brianna as she began looking at him playfully. &quot;Oh my god! That was so cute!. Ooh, can you make that noise again if I spank you ass one more time?&quot; She says as she spanks his butt again, causing him to release another invoulentarry moan. Jeff just couldn&#39;t help it. For some reason, his ass just felt so good when she spanked it. <br />
<br />
This continued for a few more minutes until Jeff&#39;s Mother called out to him from outside his door. &quot;Jeff? Did you have a girl comming over? You could have told us you know. Also have you seen Brianna from the party yesterday, apparently she went missing sometime durring the party yesterday after you left. If you see her please let either me or her parents know.... Jeff? Are you in there?&quot;</p>
