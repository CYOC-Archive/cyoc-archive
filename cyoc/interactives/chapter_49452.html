<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... high school football player eh?&quot; Julie asked making awkward small talk with the <br />
tabby. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; The tabby said with a large tone of bitterness, &quot;Some reserve player I didn't even <br />
know the name of apparently wanted my spot, I thought the Game was a bunch of kitty <br />
litter so I ended up with both. Apparently the guy, -who I am very sure I barely spoken to <br />
before!- Though Daring me to just quite the team or Transforming me into a skinny <br />
clumsy guy was somehow -too nice-! I swear the guy had to be on too much or not <br />
enough medication!  So he dared me to write a suicide note and never ever speak to or in <br />
any form whatever so ever communicate with any of my family or friends again, then <br />
Transformed into a house cat leaving me with the ability to speak just  for spite... he also <br />
told me precisely how I'd die of old age within two decades now being a house cat!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Madam Serenity said, &quot;Trevor doesn't get to share his story that often and... it can <br />
be a lot for him to carry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;i don't want your pity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's also scared that if he manages to make a friend he'll stop being able to communicate <br />
to that person due to his curse.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I said stop it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie looked in horror as she realized the full scope of Trevor's curse. <br />
<br />
&quot;What if you got hold of the game again for someone to Transform you into a human <br />
being?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't work. He included IN the transform itself that I'd die of old age within twenty <br />
years no matter what species I was at the time or whatever dare or transform was given <br />
me! So even if I was made human again I'd succumb to  premature aging.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What did he do with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He dumped me in a pet store when the owner wasn't looking after putting a muzzle on <br />
my mouth so I couldn't say the game back to him. ... I was in there for a year at least, the <br />
place didn't have a calendar or holiday decorations so I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's as smart as ever but dates confuse him sometimes as part of his curse it seems so he <br />
can't know how long he has left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said shut up!&quot; He said actually with a couple tears in his eyes, loathing them as they <br />
came.  &quot;At any rate, some girl came in, chatting with me at random tra la la, like she knew I <br />
could understand her. When the owner wasn't look she took off the muzzle and lifted me <br />
out of the pen. First time in a year at least I could speak again! I didn't hesitate and asked <br />
her the game. She ended up choosing transform.  She didn't think the curse was real and <br />
that I was just a regular talking cat. Yes, that's what she said. I gave her cat ears, tail and a <br />
few minor things as a proof of how real the game was. But instead of asking me back the <br />
game, she screamed and ran away... I took the chance to high tail it... I tried going back to <br />
my family but... I just couldn't... so I wandered about for a bit and found myself with <br />
Madam a few weeks ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity said, &quot;I can sense -when- the game is invoked but I can't sense where.&quot; She <br />
answered Julie's question before she could ask it.  &quot;He help me finally find this one little <br />
boy got turned into a mouse with a human life-span but had gone crazy from it <br />
happening, lucky he had smarts enough to type out a message to his family on a <br />
processor when I showed him to them... whoever cursed the boy however make sure to <br />
the lad harmlessly dared the curse back to the asker. It was likely the person who gave <br />
the game to who transformed Trevor.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie wondered what kind of crazy town her family had moved to. <br />
<br />
Julie also wondered how much of Trevor's story was true and how much was point of view <br />
of a jock who didn't realize how much he hurt others, but at the same time she couldn't <br />
deny the talking cat in front of her. <br />
<br />
When they got to the house via Julie's car, the house looking perfectly mundane, they <br />
encountered their first road block. Front door was locked. there was also a 'For Sale' by the <br />
real estate the house by default returned to in absence of the owners. <br />
<br />
However, Trevor happened to find that the door next to the kitchen was sealed with far <br />
more mundane measures with the door having been removed. Trevor crawled in, undid the <br />
lock on the front door on the inside and two women stepped inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; Trevor said covering his nose with one paw, &quot;Whoever was here sprayed this place <br />
good! They decidedly didn't want whoever came looking to be able to SMELL what <br />
happened here in any shape or form. My nose can't pick anything but a bunch of <br />
deodorant and anti-scent sprays! It's that stuff that negates a smell rather than just <br />
covers it up...my nose is useless!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two women looked at each other and sighed, seems they had some detective work <br />
ahead of them. <br />
<br />
Of course, it was the next day after Frank had called Julie and he had not come home, that <br />
was when she had called the police, and then later called the FBI, and it hadn't been until <br />
the NEXT day -after- that she had finally exhausted all her option and had gone to the <br />
bizarre woman she had assumed was some kind of fortune teller. Only then and only then <br />
had she gone to Madam Serenity. So effectively, Julie had not gone to Madam Serenity for <br />
three whole days!  One day waiting for Frank to come home to talk about it, one day talking <br />
to the police and getting nowhere, and another day talking to the FBI getting nowhere. <br />
THEN coming to see Madam Serenity (it would have been a little silly for her to go see a <br />
'fortune teller' a on the same day her husband vanished when it was still before the time <br />
he was supposed to come home!) <br />
<br />
Now that we've seen this preview of events that will occur relating to Julie, let's turn back <br />
to the clock to the wolf's estate, there was a lot to happen in the next few days before Julie <br />
began her fated search. <br />
<br />
The kids had moved the majority of Jennifer's stuff to the master bedroom, the majority of <br />
stuff in the master bedroom originally to a store room where it was divided by Jenny into <br />
stuff to be auctioned off, and the useless left overs (girl magainzes, eyeliner, etc) had <br />
gone onto the garbage.  Kaylee had been all for burning all the clothes in the house in a <br />
bond fire, which excited the kids but Jensen figured they'd be more viable to the pack sold <br />
off.  The items of clothing however that weren't even worth the cost to ship did indeed go <br />
into the fire which the wolf cub's cheered as it happened. <br />
<br />
Jenny had placed several items on E-Bay and by that night had sold a good deal of them <br />
already and had the twins with ninja like speed and stealth put them out for UPS at the <br />
outside of the Estate's mailbox. Not that it would have matter, IF the driver had seen them, <br />
he would have not found anything wrong with two naked wolf women and wouldn't have <br />
even felt it worth mentioning when asked for an in-depth description. <br />
<br />
Since the staff was not available at the time at the estate, the twin at dinner time had <br />
taken a large hunk of meat from the meat locker and returned with it barely cooked. Not <br />
that the wolves cared and sickness wasn't really an issue.  Jenny made notes on how much <br />
meat they had, and how large the pack was likely to get before they could bring in herd <br />
animals and thus how much meat she'd have to order to be delivered to the house. <br />
<br />
The wolves tore into their meal without forks or knives, their fangs and claws working well <br />
enough, leaving them all bloody in the face and blood in the fangs before washing <br />
themselves (didn't want to completely scare the staff tomorrow). Not Bart, not Jenny, not <br />
Kevin, not Marcy, nor any of the adult wolves blink an eyelash or gave a second thought to <br />
their style of eating. <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla leaned against each other with satisfaction of a job well done. The twins <br />
thought about, 'This is a good thing. We're like a family with Master. True there's always <br />
feeding Master's carnal hungers and creature comforts.&quot; Both twins laughed, 'Not that we <br />
have even the slightest problem with THAT!' Both were excited at the idea of Master inside <br />
them. 'But all in all, we're all getting along pretty well... the more people that become part <br />
of the pack the better...' While the twins knew it was likely an impossible dream, but the <br />
idea of the entire town being a community of wolves who GOT ALONG was appealing to <br />
them somehow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Send a text message to Martha and MAKE SURE she gets it, I don't want any surprises <br />
tomorrow. I want her to show up before ANY of the staff tomorrow, have her get here <br />
before dawn if that's what it takes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course master dad! She'll have to be dead not to get our message.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! I want her to be Transform or Dared before any of the other staff arrive, she'll be <br />
your Asker to transform or dare the first batch of staff. I'll oversee Martha's transform or <br />
Dare with Kevin's turn.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And I already have some unique ideas on how ta specialize some of the staff father! You'll <br />
love'em!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I'll look over them after we Transform or Dare Martha.&quot; <br />
<br />
After that, Kaylee finally got her Wii set up and challenged the cubs to a fighting game <br />
tournament. Kaylee was taken out in the first round and Kevin emerged as the victor. <br />
<br />
By Jensen's command, the cubs had gone to bed when told, though Jenny did spend a bit <br />
more looking over numbers for the estate. Meanwhile, Jensen looked at Kaylee and the <br />
twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;This time there are no nosy neighbors to hear us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee and the twins all grinned as they followed their master to the master bedroom.</p>
