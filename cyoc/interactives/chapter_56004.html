<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was dark, stuffy, and reeked like a gym bag full of dirty <br />
jockstraps. Chad crinkled up his nose.  It was dark.  His face was hot <br />
and sticky. A heavy piece of fabric covered his head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What a nightmare!&quot; groaned Chad.  He shook his head shaking the sand <br />
from his eyes.  <br />
<br />
Chad arched his body stretching it full length.  He tried to move his <br />
hands, but his hands and arms were pinned to his hot throbbing body.<br />
<br />
Hot,and throbbing?  He stared into the darkness. He had to have been a <br />
dream. Maybe he had had an accident?  Maybe he was paralyzed in a <br />
hospital bed with a bandage over his face?  That was more likely than <br />
the other.  Why couldn't he remember the accident?<br />
<br />
Why should he have dreamt of you?  Justice?  Guilt for his bullying of <br />
you?  Maybe?  He shakes his head. Maybe he's still dreaming?<br />
<br />
The fabric rips away from his head.  The cool air is a relief.  Chad <br />
inhales deeply and opens his eyes again to blink in the brighter but <br />
dimly lit cavernous room.  Chad gasps.  He's suddenly airborne.  He's <br />
flying threw the air high above the carpeted floor and giant feet.  <br />
Giant feet? Definitely still dreaming. The unfamiliar room races by, <br />
and there's a large doorway ahead. Through the dark doorway, then <br />
there's a flash of light, as Chad blinks blinded and bouncing up and <br />
down in midair.  He feels like he's going to vomit. His mouth opens <br />
and lets a hot torrent spew out.  He'd heard about projectile vomiting <br />
before, but had never done it until now.  It was awful. The hot liquid <br />
seemed to literally be flowing through and out of him.  It tasted like <br />
piss.  He didn't know how he could hold so many gallons inside his <br />
body.  He could hear the cascading liquid hitting the blue lake far <br />
below.  It took a few seconds for it to sink in that the lake was <br />
actually a giant toilet. Then Chad noticed the taste.  At last the <br />
torrent of liquid seemed to slack off a bit. It dribbled to a stop.<br />
<br />
Chad spat out the last of the foul liquid, and exclaimed,  &quot;Damn, what <br />
did I drink last night?  It tasted like piss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  Oh, yeah, haha, I had forgotten about you Chad,&quot; your voice <br />
booms from high over Chad, &quot;You better get used to the taste. I <br />
usually piss at least 3 or 4 times a day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Chad turns his head and looks up your giant naked torso, &quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, Chad, you really are my cock, and I am proud to have you as <br />
my manhood.  You already are performing splendidly, and I can't wait <br />
to try you out on my study date today.  But first,&quot; you say sniffing <br />
your armpit, &quot;We need to get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad's protests are drowned out by the roaring torrent of the shower <br />
and sudsy soap in his eyes and mouth, and body.<br />
<br />
You hear him squeak at one point, &quot;Gawd, no!&quot;<br />
<br />
You are jacking off in the shower.  He is quiet afterward.  He hangs <br />
sullenly deflating, your new foreskin covers Chad's hairy head. You <br />
towel off, and pull on your red bikini briefs.  You adjust Chad so his <br />
face is buried in your balls. Even through the heavy Axe soap scent, <br />
Chad can still make out your body odor.  It reminds him that he is <br />
owned totally by you.<br />
<br />
He is trapped in the warm, damp darkness after you dress. You walk <br />
around, sit, stand, walk, sit again, and then he hears the car engine <br />
roar. Ten minutes pressed against your body, and then he enjoys the <br />
respite as you stand and he slides away from your body a bit.  He's <br />
still attached, and still trapped in the pouch, but it doesn't weigh <br />
as much.<br />
<br />
You slam the door.  You walk. Then stand. A distant chime echoes after <br />
you ring the doorbell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Mrs. Stuart!  I'm here to tutor Richard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard Stuart?  Rick Stuart!  Chad's team mate is named Rick Stuart.  <br />
It has to be the same guy.  He knew that Rick was getting tutored <br />
because of his grades, and since you're one of the school brainiacs it <br />
made sense that you were tutoring him.  Now if only he could make <br />
himself know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dicky!&quot; he hears you say, &quot;I've got a surprise for you after we <br />
do your math problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dicky?  Rick would deck any guy who called him that.  Must be another <br />
Richard Stua-<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, sir.  I am ready to begin my lesson, and will do my best <br />
so that I can see that surprise you promised me, sir,&quot; Chad recognizes <br />
Rick's voice, but he sounds so subservient.  Chad wonders what you did <br />
to his big buddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Dicky.  Let's start with quadratic equations, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don't really get those, sir,&quot; he laments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we ought to do them, Dicky, until you do,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. Now let's start where we left off, problem 15.  What answer <br />
did you get after I left?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;54?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-uh, show me your work. Ah, here's the error.  See!&quot; you point and <br />
cross out his work and right the correct way to resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see the answer is 42!&quot;<br />
<br />
This goes on for nearly 2 hours, and Chad is getting antsy in your <br />
trousers.  He wonders who your study date will be with and how soon. <br />
Chad tunes out your discussion, until you at last stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Dicky, you did very well today.  It's time for you to unwrap <br />
your present,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you, sir, thank you!&quot; Rick says.<br />
<br />
When Chad gets back to normal he plans to throttle Rick for behaving <br />
that way around you of all people, even if you are tutoring him.  He <br />
hears your belt buckle jangle. Your trousers drop, red tinted light <br />
streams in through your red brief. The red tinged light shifts as the <br />
fabric is pulled away, and Chad swings free. He sighs in relief.  But <br />
his sigh becomes a gasp as he peers out of your hooded cock and down <br />
at Rick.  Rick is a 250 lb linebacker and your team mate. He is <br />
sitting on his knees wearing a jockstrap which reads &quot;Property of -<br />
&quot;and your name is written there!  Dicky looks up at eagerly at your <br />
crotch with his tongue hanging out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Master, you're bigger than before! Uh,  a lot bigger,&quot; he says <br />
with a tinge of fear in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, it'll fit and you'll be used to it in no time, Dicky!&quot; <br />
you say.<br />
<br />
Chad's mind is reeling.  Dicky and you cannot mean that you intend to <br />
shove him inside of Dicky's uh- no- no. Dicky is the study date!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now kiss it, caress it with your tongue, and see how big it gets, <br />
Dicky!&quot; you order.<br />
<br />
Breathlessly the big football player whispers, &quot;Oh, thank you, <br />
Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad feels Rick's hot breath and wet lips press against your foreskin.  <br />
He doesn't want to - but Chad starts to swell bigger.</p>
