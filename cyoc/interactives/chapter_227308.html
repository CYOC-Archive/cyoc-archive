<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew was not a happy man. Seeing the US decay and decline because of liberalism was painful. He grew up a Christian conservative with actual real values, but most of his family had betrayed their heritage. His brother and sister were both liberals and had abandoned the church. His town had become engulfed by Hispanic migrants. Blacks had run rampant in riots and no one had done anything to stop them. Libtards were feeding communist doctrine to his children, so he had no choice but to homeschool them along with his wife. <br />
<br />
His resources were strained. It was so hard to afford anything with the moronic left in charge of their country. He worked like a dog at his job as a tree trimmer, and it was thankless and exhausting work. Every day, he mourned the loss of American heritage, and dreamed of going back in time to the 40s or 50s when life was good and culture was intact. Back then, a man like him could have so much more. Instead of an apartment, he could have a house all of his own, and his wife wouldn&#39;t have to work at all. His wife had to work from home when she wasn&#39;t teaching their children all of the subjects the libtard teachers at school were too fucking stupid to teach now. They let any communist with dyed rainbow hair teach children sexual education and other commie crap, he thought bitterly. How he missed the idea of schools where they taught only values and discipline along with the subjects of science, math and writing.  <br />
<br />
One day, he came across a book, a blank journal. He had purchased it from an estate sale. Some old woman had died and it was in a box full of other books. He hadn&#39;t found anything in the pages when he was at the sale but he figured he could use a blank journal. After a few months, he found himself in his garage. Then, somehow, a miracle occurred. The words sprang across the book before his very eyes to think about something he wanted to know and then turn the page. Was this book demonic? He immediately thought. <br />
<br />
The book explained immediately its origins and assured Andrew that it had nothing to do with evil or demons, but that it could rewrite reality itself, giving him powers over how the rules by which at least Earth was governed. <br />
<br />
&quot;God has given me this gift, and I will use it to make everything right again,&quot; he said to himself. <br />
<br />
He got to work. He wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;Culture has not evolved or changed a whole lot in America since the 50s. The country is ruled by Christian men and there are no communists. I live comfortably in a large house and I am highly respected in my community. The USA is the most powerful country in the world with no rivals. Every white man is respected and given the dignity he deserves.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew smiled as he finished and closed the book. There was a flash of white light. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he found himself in a large house, with a spacious kitchen. Two black people were there, cooking and preparing food for his family. The children ran in. His daughter was wearing a bonnet and his son was wearing what appeared to be a miniature suit. His wife followed and suddenly Andrew realized with a start that he had a large beard and waxed mustache as well as a tailored suit and vest. He could hear horses outside. <br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t specified WHICH 50s he suddenly realized. America, and the world, had not moved on from 1850s culture. He owned several slaves, he realized with some satisfaction. As any self respecting white man had a right to do, he thought. The carriage outside allowed him to inspect his property to make sure everything on the plantation was running smoothly. <br />
<br />
The house was filled with fine china, amazing handmade furniture, and all eletronics had disappeared from the face of the planet. As it turned out, a solar flare had wiped them all out decades before. The South had convinced the North to accept slavery and they had exported their philosophy of a slavery driven economy around the world. Black slavery was acceptable on every continent now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Father, would you like to smoke your pipe now?&quot; his wife asked him after a sumptuous meal later that night. <br />
<br />
I smoke a pipe now? he thought with some surprise. &quot;Of course, dear lady.&quot; <br />
<br />
It seemed that all was well with the world. Andrew realized there was no crime because the US government simply didn&#39;t tolerate it and punished it severely. A walk through town revealed that everyone was happy and dressed like it was the 19th century. There were no modern problems, no cel phones or computers, just a simple agrarian community that also happened to be a paradise of respect. People bowed to him slightly everywhere he went, as he was one of the richest landowners in the area. <br />
<br />
After his children got sick with influenza, he told the book that medicine should be the one technology to have come far within the last few hundred years and so medicine was readily available. Andrew wrestled with some guilt over enslaving all black people of African descent. They seemed to be happy as slaves, used to a system where everyone knew their place. But he also felt like exploring what he could really do with this reality... </p>
