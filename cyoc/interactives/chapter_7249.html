<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank Jr. worked the circus ring like an old pro pony. Every crack  of the whip made him turn and spin, or rear up and paw the air. At least the applause from the crowd told their delight in the act. The act was made easier yet by those conditioned responses learned by experiance over the past few weeks. Although the inhabiting soul had changed the actual mind and body remained as it had been long before.<br />
<br />
The youth found this older pony body to be rittled with the aches which only age can bring. Unlike when he was changed for an evening, this body had been a pony stallion's from birth and was close to twenty years old.<br />
<br />
As Mark and the big four Percherons chidded him over being gay, Frank would have argued the point. Actually it was Matt that was gay, but as pony nostrils sniffed the huge sheaths of the nearby Percherons a conditioned response etched into the mind of the black pony made things happen.<br />
<br />
Even as his head and tongue turned up and reached out to slurp and clean the heavy scented sheath and cock he was revolted by the action. Time would be the teacher of his pony self while the new inhabitant also learned the ways of the world as to being a pony and stallion.<br />
<br />
Evening came and more shows and more showing off for the crowds. A pat on his neck and an occasional sugar cube for reward made Franky feel happy. Happy was as his experiance went along. The night seemed longer than his afternoon. He was tied with others to the rope line. Looking about Franky saw for the first time the raw life style of this sensual pony's form. Privacy that he had as a human when doing the needs of body were not allowed to animals. <br />
<br />
Turning his head Franky watched the tired horses stretch and drop manure or urinate into their bedding straw and then crumple down to lay in the excretions. The evening he'd spent as a stallion being at stud with mares he'd not once urinated but went with absolute delights from mare to mare. He hadn't thought or considered the natural bodily needs of the animal as he had only experianced the pleasures before.<br />
<br />
At last he fell asleep in his spot along the roped line of horses and ponies. The sounds of morning with it's smells of frying eggs, bacon, biskets, made him lick his dry lips. Passions of human exsistance were not to be his anylonger. A circus worker came with a wagon loaded of sacks filled with dry grain and bales of sweet smelling green hay.<br />
<br />
The man walked from one pony to another offering a community buck filled with water. As Franky dipped his head down into it for a cool morning drink the water was covered in a greenish white film from other ponies' saliva. Although he was terrible thirsty Franky at first withdrew from the busket feeling revolted by it's lack of being clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on there Blackie' you'd better drink now or wait till noon for another chance!&quot; beconed the man holding the bucket.<br />
<br />
Thirst was the driving force as Blackie' Franky dipped into the bucket drinking it dry. Then the pony he was instinctively turned toward the grain sac pulled over the head. Thick lips reached and grabbed for the sweet seeds as teeth mashed it into a thick mush.<br />
<br />
Once the musty smelling community feedbag was removed the new drives were toward a pile of fresh cut half greened hay. Franky for a time lost all control and reasoning as his pony body self reeled in delights for food as it had learned of it over time.<br />
<br />
The breakfast done the Handlers came for the four great dappled gray Percherons for a parade down the main street of Cooper. Once the handsome four were harnessed to the steam colliapie, they returned to place fuzzy ploums on pony heads. <br />
<br />
Franky laughed to himself as he thought how silly the ponies looked. Then they came to Franky and throwing a heavy banner over his back they lead him to the front of the procession. <br />
<br />
The walk down paved streets on steel pony shoes sent shocks up into little animal legs. Franky found that walking on dirt ground was the norm, but pavement was very hard and offered not one bit of comfort with every step. As the procession enter the town even Franky could see that the huge Percherons were having trouble as they felt the jolts from every stride.<br />
<br />
The crowds were as a mixed noise to Franky's pointed ears. As his human thoughts denoted a word here and there he found it all the more a distraction. As everything which he saw, heard, and felt was making him exceedingly uneasy the pony began to twist and turn. The animal he was wanted to escape this torture and just run! <br />
<br />
The handler leading Franky down the street began to talk rough to him, ordering the pony to take it easy. Normally Franky might have been reasonable but the urge to escape his pains was strong. walking turned to prancing as the hindlegs tristed, ready to bolt out for the far reaches and just run!<br />
<br />
Now strong deep minded urges, instincts, and wild beastial fear raged in Franky. The animal he was now took total control making sweat spread over his jet black hairy hide. This too made comprehension of his plight all the more troublesome, snorting and as teeth bit at the steel curse which tugged in his mouth. Strings of green saliva dripped from the almost wild beast's mouth. Franky began to shake his head in fond hope of breaking the Handlers grip, but nothing worked. The Handler had more experiance with instinct driven creatures and held on to Franky no matter what the pony tried.<br />
<br />
When the procession returned to the circus a hot and wrought pony stallion stood covered in sweat.<br />
<br />
Shaking drom his terrible experiance as a pony Franky saw Mark coming toward him. A towel in hand he began to dry the salty sweat off the scared pony. Franky turned his head and whinnied the anguish he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, finding the lifestyle on pony life a little less thrilling than you expected! Well I suppose after you spend three months like this becoming human again will be a lot more charming, right Franky boy?&quot; asked Mark with a smile.<br />
<br />
The rubbing calmed those animal passions and the youth was again able to think rather than live under instincts only. Calm as calm does on a pony Franky felt his pony cock begin to extend. As hindlegs spread and stance was lengthened he let loose a torent of pungent smelling urine.<br />
<br />
Again the instincts of pony brain took control and turning his head back as far as the rope lead might allow he sniffed at the puddle of his own urine. Beastly passion urged him on to drink in his own scent. The pungent odor was to the pony mind thought like perfume.<br />
<br />
Mark stood off as he saw what was to happen. Then walking up close he began again to smooth ruffled fur and dry the black coat of hair to a bright black shine. &quot;Franky finding life a little more basic? I've been in the circus all my life, handled every kind of animal there is on this earth too. Trust me when I say, being an animal is not all a bunch of fun and free living. You as the others must work by breaking your back just as if you were a human working here like me. Oh to be sure that every animal gets his or her pleasures from time to time! I suppose that's why stallion's go crazy wild, mean, and fight for the rights to mate. If you are here come Fall the passion to mate will make you a raged beast too. You will fight other males for your harem as you taunt the mares to stay close while you mount, thurst, and enjoy that big cock for what was made to do, well for now there's work to be done!&quot; explained Mark to a frightened pony stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Baggy the Black is ready for the ring, get his show harness and make him ready!&quot; called Mark to a Handler Clown.<br />
<br />
Franky took a deep breathe and stood looking about as his fear calmed and mind relaxed. The noon show was soon to start, his day had just begun!</p>
