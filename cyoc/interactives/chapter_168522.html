<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I asked…”<br />
<br />
Helter thrust himself up to the hilt into Ty.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to be…”<br />
<br />
Ty groaned, feeling every contour of the leonine shaft pulling back until just the head remained inside.<br />
<br />
“My cat-boy?”<br />
<br />
With the last syllable, the lion slammed back into him, forcing the air out of the wizard’s lungs in an ecstatic cry. <br />
<br />
“Aaaaa! Yes, I want to, yes!”<br />
<br />
Helter paused briefly to savour the moment as the body underneath him reflexively tightened around the cock deep inside of it. He really had picked a good one here. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t quite hear that?” He growled from deep within his chest, pulling back again to a weak moan of loss from Ty.<br />
<br />
He powered back into the wizard.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Came the reply, slightly muffled as Ty’s face was driven into the furs on the floor of the tent.<br />
<br />
And again.<br />
<br />
“Yes!”<br />
<br />
And again.<br />
<br />
“Oh please, Yes! Yes… Ahhhh!” Ty’s voice breaking into a soft cry as his senses were overloaded by both the masculine rod pressed deep into his most sensitive areas and the equally masculine scent of Helter’s heavy body pressing down onto him.<br />
<br />
With a grunt the lion-man eased his still rigid member out of the wizard’s now gaping ass, leaving Ty presenting himself on his knees. He paused momentarily to deliver a slap to Ty’s left cheek, sending a ripple through the flesh and setting the dregs of Ty’s orgasm dripping from his still hard cock swinging, before striding to a dark wood chest on the other side of the tent. He knelt on one knee, flipping up the faded brass latch and levering open the container with the creak of the hinges he’d never bothered to oil.<br />
<br />
Ty slid forwards, his legs finally totally giving way. He couldn’t think straight, it was like that dick had gone in at his ass and straight up to his head, rearranging anything in the way. He turned over and tried to sit up. Shouldn’t he get back to his friends? They might need…<br />
Helter had turned back around. His huge dick was still hard, glistening and pointing straight at him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he was sure his friends could wait.<br />
<br />
In his left hand Helter now held a crystal bottle, stoppered with wax. Inside it a deep blue liquid rested, shimmering slightly, like the stars at night, points of light flickering and flowing as the liquid moved.<br />
<br />
“On your knees” Came the command from the lion man.<br />
<br />
Ty scrambled over before dropping to his knees, Helter’s cock once again in his face, teasing him as it bobbed up and down in rhythm with the mercenary’s pulse. From this angle Helter was all the more intimidating, Ty’s eyes following the line of his taught abdomen up to the face at the centre of that flowing mane, Helter’s eyes giving away nothing but lust for what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
He popped the seal on the potion, wispy vapour coiling over the lip of the bottle.<br />
<br />
“Since you asked so nicely…” He produced a small glass pipette in his right hand and drew up a fraction of the deep blue substance and grinned down at Ty. “…open wide!”<br />
<br />
Ty’s cock hadn’t really had much of a chance to soften up since that last fucking, but all hope of that was gone now. His dick was as hard as ever, curving slightly up, as he tipped his head back, eyes closed.<br />
<br />
A single droplet fell into his mouth. Strange sensations and flavours ran wild. Just the single viscous droplet he’d felt fall in set his cheeks tingling. His tongue felt like an ice cube had been dropped onto it, radiating a chill out from the point of impact. The taste reminded him of Helter’s scent, sharp, masculine, almost acrid. But there was something else, a fruit or spice mixed in that became more prominent and warmed him as the first taste began to fade. He swirled his tongue around the inside of his mouth, savouring the flavour. <br />
<br />
But that was it, he didn’t feel really different, and he received no more drops of the strange liquid. The wizard opened his eyes, directing a look mixing questioning and disappointment at Helter.<br />
<br />
“Now now. It’s potent stuff but that was just a little to get you going.” The lion smirked. “Look down.”<br />
<br />
Ty did. Helter’s cock still stood proud before him, but on it…<br />
<br />
“Just because you asked nicely doesn’t mean you don’t have to work for it!”<br />
<br />
On it were four more droplets of the potion spaced along over 10 inches of throbbing flesh. The first rested atop the ridge of the lion-man’s exposed head, the others spaced back along the top of the shaft, the final one resting at the very base where the cock disappeared into its sheath, merging into the coat of thick fur that framed the base of Helter’s manhood.<br />
<br />
“You still need to finish me off.” Helter flashed his sharp teeth at Ty. “The more of me you can take, the more you’ll get.”<br />
<br />
Ty didn’t hesitate. Leaning in, mouth agape, he surrounded the cock with his lips, closing just beyond the head and drawing back. He felt the first droplet touch his upper lip as his tongue dragged along under the head, the glossy pre-cum and feline potion merging together as he softly kissed the tapered point of Helter with his lips.<br />
<br />
The taste was all the more exciting with the lion man’s essence mixing with the potion. Ty imagined his earlier face-fucking as he worked on Helter’s tip, but now he was as feline as the man he was sucking off. Pointed ears. A smooth coat of fur. A tail, flicking back and forth! He was going to take this cock and make that dream become reality.<br />
<br />
He could see the next drop a little under half-way down the dick that he was already sucking further and further inside his mouth. He brought one hand up off his thighs, teasing his fingers through the fine fur that covered the sizeable pouch between the mercenary’s strong and firm legs. As he allowed the hefty balls to rest in his palm, he lowered himself to take in the second dose of potion as well as over 4 inches of dick. Two down, two to go.<br />
<br />
Yes, the taste was definitely stronger now, like a warm sunrise in his mouth as he pulled his head back again and started to bob it back and forth. He knew he wanted, needed more! <br />
<br />
But from this point on it was going to be difficult, he was close to his usual limits. Though Eric had sworn him to secrecy over it, he well remembered not being able to manage all 6 inches of his friend’s dick before gagging. <br />
<br />
Ty brought his other hand up to grasp the body of the shaft and prepare to force it down his throat, the grey and white fur on the back of his hand contrasting well with the pale gold of Helter’s chest. Fur? Fur! <br />
<br />
Ty stopped sucking to stare at his hand. This was it, it was actually working, it wasn’t just his delusions, he was…<br />
<br />
“I was wondering when you would notice.”<br />
<br />
Ty looked up to meet Helter’s gaze. The anthropomorphic lion’s eyes drilled back into him, making him flinch slightly.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t want to interrupt your fun down there.” Helter chuckled. “But I’m also not gonna let you just stare, lips straining around my dick but not doing your part. You won’t be leaving here till you have a new fluffy ass filled with my cum.”<br />
<br />
Ty quickly returned to bobbing up and down on the dick, each time trying to go that bit deeper. He was so close, his lips almost touching the third drop of potion, he was nearly there…<br />
<br />
The tip of Helter’s cock brushed against the back of his throat. Ty couldn’t help but cough and spasm suddenly at the touch. Damn! So <br />
close. <br />
<br />
Ty breathed as deeply as he could with the leonine shaft wedging his jaws apart, sucking in air through his nostrils. Oh hell, Helter smelled good! That was the thing, focus on the taste, the smell, just stay relaxed. Okay… Yes, he could do it, he just…<br />
<br />
Ty felt one of Helter’s massive hands grasp the back of his head, tangling his hair, and ram him downwards.<br />
<br />
“Aaah. That’s better. I’m not gonna tell you again. Keep sucking!”<br />
<br />
Ty’s eye’s watered. Fuck fuck fuck! It was too big! <br />
<br />
But he also felt something different this time. The cock impaling him had carried more of the potent mix of potion and Helter’s own juices to the back of his throat. He had the sensation of melting ice again at the base of his skull, but as it spread out it turned warm, relaxing and calming, leaving a gentle tingle behind. The concoction worked quickly, and the wizard could feel the tension in his throat melting away and muscles unclenching as it got to work on the flesh of his throat. <br />
<br />
He tried an experimental push down the cock again. It went straight in, sliding smoothly down, another inch in just one go! He seemingly even surprised Helter, dropping even further onto the cock than the lion-man was pushing him, eliciting an approving grunt from deep in Helter’s throat that only served to turn Ty on more.<br />
<br />
Ty hadn’t even noticed when he’d started growing fur, but he noticed something now. Like the tingling he’d felt in his throat and cheeks, but it was concentrating at the base of his spine, like little needle-points of pleasure flowing from all over his body and arrowing in on that one spot. He knew he must be nearly there; his tail was coming! He just needed that last taste of the potion. He could see it, nestled just ahead of where the rigid flesh disappeared inside its sheath.<br />
<br />
A minute ago, he would have doubted he could have reached it, but now with each stroke he was advancing towards it. Almost there. Two inches. One inch. Half an inch! Pulling back to breathe in again Ty could barely sit still in anticipation. One more effort would do it!<br />
<br />
Looking down from above Helter could see Ty’s quickly lengthening tail, a mix of light and dark greys like the most of the soft coat that was quickly covering all areas where the delicate flesh of the wizard could still be seen. It had taken on a life of its own, swishing back and forth rapidly as Ty unconsciously sifted on his haunches, taking aim at his prey.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Take it all. Surrender your humanity to me!” Helter snarled at Ty, egging the wizard on. “You’re so close to pleasure unlike anything your species has felt before without black magics, so take it now, take my cock all the way into yourself and become what you were always mean to be!”<br />
<br />
Ty hadn’t thought it was possible for him to get any harder. He had clearly been wrong. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to waste another moment, Ty took both his hands, quickly noting the white tint to the fur of his palms and wrists, and grasped the firm muscled cheeks of Helter’s rear, sinking his fingers into the flesh. Then, in one fluid motion, Ty dived down onto the cock opening his throat wide and swallowing it whole. He bottomed out. What he realised must now be his muzzle buried itself deep into the fur around Helter’s sheath, making contact with his hot body and drowning Ty’s senses in musk, heat and the soft embrace of Helter’s pelt. He couldn’t stop his eyes from rolling back into his head as his tongue lapped around the shaft in his mouth, savouring at last the final catalyst of his transformation.<br />
<br />
As it was absorbed into his blood he felt not only the strange cooling and warming sensation flow over his entire body, but also the great muscled hands of Helter clasp around his skull, vice-like, pushing his new ears down against his reshaping skull. The shaft in his mouth pulsed, once, twice, then he felt rumbling cry of Helter’s climax resonate through it and into him as hot semen splashed directly into his stomach.<br />
<br />
Helter held Ty like this for nearly half a minute, releasing him just before the transforming wizard blacked out, his turgid cock released and flicking up as Ty fell back. The great leonine man had to take a few steps back to collect himself, his cock finally beginning to soften, even as a dazed Ty smiled contentedly on the floor. The wizard had needed help, but fuck, once he actually got going it had felt good.<br />
The wizard’s changes were accelerating now. <br />
<br />
Ty brought one hand up to eyes bleary with tears in fascination. The white fur merged into grey just above his wrists, but re-emerged at his chest and abdomen, giving him the appearance of little white gloves on his hand. <br />
Suddenly there was a throbbing pain in his upper jaw and grasped his mouth in shock, before running a finger along his teeth and nearly drawing blood as new sharper canines grew in. Ty looked down, marvelling, as the fur, no, his fur, swallowed the last bits of human skin around his feet. Then again, there was that focusing of tingling like he’d felt with his tail, now around his toes. Reaching down Ty pushed white fur aside to watch his clumsy human toes warp into his new paws, sharp claws forming atop each digit and soft pads underneath.<br />
<br />
Wait, his tail, he’d almost forgotten!<br />
<br />
Ty spun round, in his excitement not realising his mistake as the sinuous grey tail flicked away from him as soon as he got close. Collecting himself, Ty found he could easily flex enough to look back over his shoulder, catching a glimpse of an ass that had rounded out nicely, and reached one hand behind him, trying the catch his new limb, which was still happily swishing from side to side without any conscious input on his part.<br />
<br />
Taking a second to calm himself again, he was able to tame his tail and bring it around his body. The slight caress he gave it with his hand sent pins and needles down its length, before reaching his spine and they ran all the way up to his head again, making Ty tremble at the strange feelings his now new and unfamiliar body could give him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, gods this feels good” <br />
<br />
Ty moaned, subconsciously reaching for his crotch to sate the heat that was growing in his loins.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck…” He gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
Ty’s new member was just finishing forming, the last piece of humanity to be swept away. <br />
His foreskin felt like it was being pulled down and taught, the skin folding up around the base to form his new sheath. At the same time the tingling was focussing finally into it, like every effort of the potion’s magic was pouring into just this one point, his dick standing as rigid as steel. Captivated by the site of his final changes, Ty stared slack-jawed at his throbbing member even as he began to work his hand up and down it’s slick shaft. <br />
<br />
Quickly, the last of the human skin tones were giving way to animalistic flesh, a pink rod jutting out from the folds of a furry sheath, oozing lubrication from its tip. It had gained maybe an inch in length on its human predecessor.<br />
<br />
He stroked faster, gripping harder. <br />
<br />
The rounded head began to taper to a sharp point.<br />
<br />
Faster still, his now rough tongue licking round his lips.<br />
<br />
There they were! Ty felt the little nubs of his newly sensitive short penile spines. He was a cat-boy in the most intimate way now!<br />
<br />
Moaning and biting his lip, Ty quickly licked a finger on his left hand and reached behind his tail, pushing upwards into himself. At the same instant as that he pulled all the way down on his new feline dick with his other hand, making sure to tease the unique features of his new genitals.<br />
<br />
For the second time inside 5 minutes Ty fell back onto the floor, eyes shut, pleasure cascading along every neuron in his body, shutting out everything except his orgasm. He felt himself rhythmically clamp down on his own finger in time to the white ribbons of semen that spurted from his cock, quickly making a mess of the fur around his face and on his chest.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you like it” <br />
<br />
Helter spoke at last, as he strode towards the blissed-out Ty, his re-erect cock a testament to his appreciation for the show Ty had just put on. <br />
<br />
“Now though, I think it’s time we break that new ass of yours in with something a bit more substantial than a finger…”</p>
