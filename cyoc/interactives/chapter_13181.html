<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David watched as the large steel basin with sides four feet high was slowly filling with a murky liquid. His pain level right then was so high he could not speak or ask as to what this might mean for him. Soon he was to find out.<br />
<br />
As the large basin like tub filled to just a foot below the rim David felt himself moving lower. Down he went first his dumb toes, then his aching shins, legs, thighs, and to his waist. At that point he was suspended in the warm liquid as his pain of the lower limbs stopped.<br />
<br />
Breathing a small amount of relief from the level of pain he had so far endured he was beginning to rather accept what was to come. It was like the Lady had told him. Even if he wouldn't wish to be for her some rude and evil minded demon creature it was better then living in this painful way.<br />
<br />
Out of the darkness and into the harsh bright light which poured down over David came one of the large Eunuchs. He had a large seringe filled with a brown liquid and a needle net inches long.<br />
<br />
Suddenly fromout of the darkness behind David came the brother Eunuch who took a firm grip on David's head. Eyes wide in fear but unable to move of get away he had to watch what was to happen.<br />
<br />
The Eunuch took a vise grip to David's chin pressing his thumb had into the cleft of his chin. The other hand held the long needled seringe as David could do nothing but watch.<br />
<br />
Slowly the seringe was placed into David's left nostril and then evern so carefully it went in, in, and in. He would have screamed from the feeling if not for the manner his head was being held. The seringe pierced the upper sinus and worked ever closer up toward the brain.<br />
<br />
Eyes bugged out of their sockets from fear mixed with the discomfort David saw the brown liquid being pressed out the needle and felt a chill within his very skull.<br />
<br />
As the last of the liquid vanished from the seringe it was removed with great care. The vise grip to David's head was released as he then relaxed somewhat. It was when from the darkness came that tall Lady now dressed in a white Lab coat and blue slacks which made him perk up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm surprised at you, your quite strong willed and have good control even when in great pain. These are fine attributes and will make you an excellently believeible demon to all who come and see you. Now we shall see some changes happen. <br />
<br />
The seringe will cause the skull to transmut to that more equal in thickness and size of a bull. The sinus and ajoining glands will also mutate being those of a goat. <br />
<br />
I will later insert bovine horn buds into the skull which shall sprout your bullish horns. This of course will not be done right away because the present bone structure could not support the weight of those horns. <br />
<br />
The basin is filled with a serum based transformational flux liquid as it has the properties to transition your lower body to look like a large strong billy goat. Once this is completed I will have you drawn back up and through a small surgery your penis will be relocated and made to size, length, and texture of the Shetland pony.<br />
<br />
I've decided to change your skin color to a deep chocolate brown except for the pony penis which will be jet black. Your chest should remain as is if not a little expanded outward but clean of any bull hairs, goat wool, or pony hairs.&quot; explained the Lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why tell me this, why care?&quot; asked David his voice tuff sounding and gravelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to know, to remember this time of angony. It's important you remember this as for then not wishing to be placed through it all over again if you were punished later. You will obey me or suffer the pain and fate of being any one of the three animals of which they are parts of you.&quot; said the Lady.<br />
<br />
I t was like there were worms crawling around in his skull. The injected liquid was aserting its changes, he could feel its growing discomfort. Now an occasional violent shake of his head was all David could muster to rid the nasty feelings.<br />
<br />
The warm liquid about his legs and waist soon lulled his tired self into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, David, wake up David its time!&quot; said a nice friendly voice.<br />
<br />
Slowly he awoke his eye lids feeling heavy like his whole head felt awakward in so many ways. Trying to stretch his cramped body he drew his fingers into a fist feeling the points to his bird like talons protruding human fingertips.<br />
<br />
This drew his attention to give his changed hands a good long look. <br />
<br />
&quot;David!&quot; again a sweet friendly sounding voice.<br />
<br />
He turned his eyes forward and from the dank darkness beyond his light drenched steel tub came a pretty face, Rebecca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greeaccia!&quot; came the name but was distorted by lips and tongue more that of a billy goat. David blinked his eyes several times as his view of her reflected only multishades of gray and no colors.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he remembered that one long night of sexual pleasure they had together. Thrashing the murky liquid with his legs the stuff flew about making Rebecca back away into the darkness.<br />
<br />
Seeing her leave he stopped his thrashing about and hung there suspended yet by cuffed and chained wrists emersed to his waist in the basin.<br />
<br />
Again into the light came Rebecca her sweet lusty sex form of part beautiful girl and rugged goat making David think of her as exciting. Then the Lady came near a smile on her face she asked, &quot;Do you feel quite strange today?&quot;</p>
