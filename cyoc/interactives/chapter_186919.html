<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He scrolled through the options, each one looked better than the last. Jeff was so eager to get started, to try out every option, to bring karma to the worst person he knew. His concentration was only broken by the sound of his mom driving away. If his mother was leaving, that meant Alice was at cheer practice, and his mother must be going to pick her up. This only made him more excited at the thought of his sister coming home just as her very purpose in life changed. Thus, her fate was sealed; Jeff was determined to change her right as she was getting home.<br />
<br />
As for what she would become, what he left his mouse next to looked like a good option if not for ironic reasons. Unlike Jeff, Alice had a sharp tongue; her insults could hit like daggers that he always fell victim to. And now that she was getting more comfortable with strong language in front of their parents, Jeff was forced to listen to her new range of verbal abuse. With this option he could give her the function of a toilet, her mouth acting as the bowl. It seemed simple, but to Jeff, the thought of his sister going from spewing shit to eating shit, was pure comedic gold.<br />
<br />
When he was done admiring his genius, Jeff continued to the next options. Duration was set to indefinite; he would change her back only when his joke stopped being funny. Retain Human Needs was a hard decision, so he left it blank for now. In Control was another one he decided to leave blank. He wanted to take these things from her, but HE wanted to be the one to take them. The fact that it was just yes and no frustrated him enough that he skipped the rest of the settings and continued to the next section about Altering Reality.<br />
<br />
Jeff read through the description. No one would question Alice’s new form, it was appealing, the thought of his sister consuming everyone’s waste, without realizing anything was different. But something was still missing. Jeff wanted thrill, torment, submission, something to make the little brat feel all the dread of being a toilet with none of the acceptance. Even if he made her the only one aware, eventually she would stop resisting and accept her fate.<br />
<br />
He kept scrolling through the options on how to change her mind. Then something stuck out, an option that he had missed. In small letters it had written ‘Gaslight Scenario (Strange Results)’. Hovering over it, he read that reality would alter with the changes he made, but changes would only be made when he pointed out flaws in the target’s actions. So, Alice would remain unchanged until he pointed out that she wasn’t acting like a toilet. An evil grin spread across his face. He selected the new scenario, “Oh yeah, it’s all coming together.”<br />
<br />
The garage door began opening. Realizing he was out of time, Jeff hit enter. Nothing changed. He could hear Alice come inside and head towards the stairs. Knowing that she would go to her personal bathroom to take a shower, Jeff ran into his sister’s room and snuck into the bathroom. Figuring he would just get called a pervert and a moron if this didn’t work, Jeff waited for Alice to enter. Behind the door Jeff could hear her put down her pom-poms, entering her bedroom. Moment of truth.<br />
<br />
The bathroom was dark. His fingers went cold. What if it was fake? What if she was unaffected? Alice’s step grew louder as she approached. His heart was a battle drum, pounding heavier and heavier as his enemy grabbed the doorknob. The door flew open. She flicked the light switch only to jump in surprise at her brother standing there. <br />
<br />
“Jeff? Why the fuck are you in my bathroom? And why were you in the dark?” the strong language coming out of a child’s mouth was something he found unnerving, if not a bit insulting.<br />
<br />
Still needing to stumble for a retort, he replied, “Oh… Uh… I was just going to take a piss when…” His words fell flat, no thanks to Alice giving him a look. <br />
<br />
Something washed over him. That look. Did she practice that one in the mirror? Head lowered, arms crossed, eyes up with one brow raised. The whole ensemble filled him with rage, reminding him of why he was here. With the Chronivac at his back, and his mind fueled by hate, he yelled back, “I’m here for you, dumb bitch! What’s the point of a toilet like you if I can’t find you when I need to piss!” <br />
<br />
Alice backed up, so stunned to hear her brother yell that she couldn’t follow what he was saying. Then her head felt all dizzy. As she came out of her haze, her brother’s anger now seemed justified. He needed to piss, and she wasn’t there for him to piss in.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry… I just…” Alice entered the bathroom and closed the door. She got on her knees, “I’m here now. I’ll fix it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff, still riding the high of the Chronivac working, grinned from ear to ear. He unzipped his pants, pulling out his now erect penis. Alice backed away while he just grinned, “What? A toilet sees genitals all the time, so why are you so surprised?”<br />
<br />
Her eyes spun for a second, then she regained her composure. Alice approached, confused at why she backed up. “When you’re ready.” She said, hints of embarrassment lingered in voice.<br />
<br />
Jeff was enjoying the show. Especially how he could inch her along as slow as he wanted. “Honestly.” He said gripping his member. “Now you’ve done it. I’ve got an erection, guess I’m lucky you’re here. I can just cum in the toilet instead of getting a tissue.”<br />
<br />
Another haze consumed her. Coming out, the shock from her brother’s yelling was now gone. She started feeling annoyed with Jeff for occupying so much of her time. “Look, I have things to do, so jack yourself off, piss in my mouth, do whatever you need, just hurry it up.”<br />
<br />
She gave him that look again, that look of annoyed disgust. It sent Jeff into another spiral of rage. He took a single step forward and grabbed the back of Alice’s head. Pulling her down, he thrusted his penis, forcing it through her lips. Looking at her disinterested stare only made him want to pound harder. She turned her gaze to the side, like the cock in her mouth was the least interesting thing in the room. That gave Jeff just enough time to really appreciate his sister’s looks.<br />
<br />
She may be a few years younger, but she was hardly still a kid. Her face was cute and chubby, sharply contrasting her cheer makeup and cold bitch expression. Her uniform did little to hide her blossoming body. Yeah, when she shut up, Jeff could almost go so far as to call her sexy. Despite how wrong he knew it was, Jeff couldn’t help wanting to se just how far this could be pushed.<br />
<br />
It took only a couple minutes for him to reach orgasm. Alice swallowed as hard as she could, but some started dripping down her chin. When Jeff pulled out his cock, Alice finally got to speak again. “Wow, premature ejaculation much?” she began, “I’m gonna tell everyone at school that you like to put your dick in a toilet to get o- “<br />
<br />
Alice didn’t get to finish her sentence as Jeff plunged his dick back in her mouth. He started pissing while Alice just rolled her eyes. Hearing her made him so angry. He had half a mind to tell her that toilets don’t speak, and just leave her mute. But where would the fun in that be. It was extremely satisfying to hear empty threats from a girl he could force to swallow his piss and cum.<br />
<br />
Once he had left her mouth and shaken off the tip, Alice stood up. “Now, if you’re done, get out, I need to take a shower.” <br />
<br />
She turned to look at herself in the mirror. A pool of cum still sat on her chin. She reached up to wipe it off, only for Jeff to stop her. “Woah there.” She froze and looked at Jeff, “You know toilets don’t clean themselves, right? They rarely get cleaned by their owners, usually only before having guests.” While her head spun again, Jeff grabbed a square of toilet paper. Alice gazed up at him in anticipation. Jeff wiped his cum off her face, getting some makeup with it. Then he balled up the wet tissue and placed it in her mouth. She swallowed like it was only natural. <br />
<br />
Alice looked up at her brother again with confusion. She couldn’t remember why she had intended to use the shower. She didn’t know of any guests coming over. And why had she wanted to send Jeff away, when he was the one who usually did the cleaning.<br />
<br />
Jeff just loved looking at her confused face. Wanting to push things further, he jumped at the chance and lifted Alice’s skirt. Distracting her from the confusion, “What the hell you pervert!” she cried pushing her skirt back down.<br />
<br />
“I knew it!” he said, “Alice. Come on. You know toilets don’t wear underwear.” Her embarrassed look didn’t leave her face, even as her mind shifted. Before she could move, Jeff spoke again, “Don’t tell me you’re wearing a bra too, Alice what is wrong with you.” <br />
<br />
The look on her face as she reached under her skirt to pull down her panties, was what Jeff called priceless. That was followed by her reaching up to try removing her bra. Not seeing any reason to keep it intact Alice just ripped the whole thing clean off, breaking all the straps in the process. Jeff got front row seats of Alice’s premature nipples now tenting her cheer uniform. She handed her undergarments to Jeff, who was more than happy to confiscate her unneeded clothing.<br />
<br />
As Alice began to leave, she turned back to Jeff, “Hey, I’ve been really out of it today. Do you know of anything else I’m forgetting?”</p>
