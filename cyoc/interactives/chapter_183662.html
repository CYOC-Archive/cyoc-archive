<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lewis was having a weird day. Sure it was weird to be walking around the campus as a guy, most of the girls and even a good portion of the guys giving him appreciative looks but he felt.. separated from them. Like he didn&#39;t quite belong anymore. He had looked like he was in his early twenties when he peeked in the mirror this morning, not a teenager like the rest of the student body, but he had been willing to write that off as a more toned physique and the red stubble along his jaw. But then he remembered Kendall. A definite older looking Kendall. Mst guys seemed to be staying the same age, and some of the teachers seemed to be getting younger, but only he and Kendall seemed to be moving in the other direction.<br />
<br />
Lewis adjusted the back pack on his shoulder as he smiled another smile back at Vince. He had given him a blowjob under the bleachers once, back when he was a she. He wondered if Vince even remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marchand? Lewis Marchand?&quot; Lewis turned at the sound of his name to see the principal&#39;s assistant looking right at him, a folder in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; He asked, unsure why she was talking to him. His voice sounded odd in his ears, like the sounds weren&#39;t coming out quite right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Principal Miller will see you now.&quot; She said primly, though with an appreciative look up and down his body. Lewis scrunched his brows in worry but followed along anyway. She ushered him into Miller&#39;s office. The principal sat behind his desk, looking over some paperwork. Miller had always been a bit of a mousey man. Not overly imposing, and had a bit more of a buddy-adult way of dealing with his students. But there was something different about him. He didn&#39;t look younger like some of the teachers did, but with his suit jacket off and hanging from the back of his chair Lewis could see something of a toned physique under that dress shirt. He was pretty sure Principal Miller used to have something of a gut. He didn&#39;t anymore.<br />
<br />
Miller looked up with a grin. &quot;I was just going over your resume. You seem like you&#39;ll be a good fit, glad they sent you to me.&quot; He smiled, Miller had always had a friendly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fit? I, uh..&quot; Lewis shifted a little in the chair. Resume? What was the principal even talking about. And why did he feel like he had a mouth full of mush?<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Miller went on. &quot;You&#39;re the first applicant for the French teacher position that, well, seems actually fluent. We&#39;ve been using substitutes since our last one went out on maternity leave then decided to quit.&quot; Miller stood up and walked over to a filing cabinet. Lewis just stared. French? He didn&#39;t know any French, except.. He did. It was like someone had just planted the knowledge in his head complete and whole, and the way he was speaking, it wasn&#39;t mush mouth, he realized it was simply his accent. This was definitely a weird twist.<br />
<br />
He looked at Miller rifling through the filing cabinet. For a man in his forties he really was quite fit, leanly muscled with a firm round rear. Lewis licked his lips thinking about it, but snapped his eyes up to Miller&#39;s face when the principal turned around. The grin on his face said he might have known what Lewis was thinking. He held out a folder. &quot;Class schedule, approved syllabus for this year, we&#39;ll get you a laptop and your teaching materials. You start tomorrow if possible.&quot; Lewis thought this was all rather weird, and quick. He had never taught before in his life but somehow there were memories there of exactly how to do that. Like he had went to school for it.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his back pack and stood up. &quot;Well, thank you. I, uh, look forward to it.&quot; Lewis said, trying to sound sure of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a warning. Some of our students, especially the upper classmen can be.. forward. Be discreet.&quot; Miller smiled and leaned back in his chair. &quot;And if you need anything.&quot; His eyes slid up and down Lewis in that way he knew Principal Miller was more than passingly interested. &quot;Anything. My door is open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lewis took that as a dismissal and left the office, trying to hold the folder he was given to block the rather obvious tenting in his pants Miller&#39;s suggestions were causing. Well, there was no point to keep going to classes, not if things were changing around him like this. Maybe he should just head home.. or maybe hitting the boxing gym again. The thought of working off some frustration was appealing.<br />
<br />
As he decided to head out he exited the school towards the fields and saw Coach Mason, or who he thought was Coach Mason, the man looked more like the man&#39;s son than himself. Probably the same age as Lewis was now, looking in a window of the groundskeeper&#39;s hut and fondling himself, a worry line creasing his forehead, but obvious arousal in his track pants.<br />
<br />
Lewis found himself headed that way as well, curiosity getting the better of him. A few feet away he saw what the coach was watching through the window of the hut. A shirtless Kendall, leaning back with a stupefied smile on his face. When had he gotten so completely stacked with muscle? He looked even more jacked than the Coach, or maybe Mr. Clark, though it was a close call. He was so fixated on Kendall&#39;s shirtless body that it took him a while to notice Allison was the one bobbing up and down on that monster of a cock.<br />
<br />
Lewis felt envy boiling up in him, and his cock suddenly stiffening ramrod straight in his pants. &quot;Holy fuck..&quot; Though the words came out under his breath, and in French he realized. He wanted Kendall more than ever, to bury his cock in that thickly muscled rear and.. He hadn&#39;t been quiet, and he realized with a start that the coach was looking right at him, looking as worried at being caught as he himself felt.</p>
