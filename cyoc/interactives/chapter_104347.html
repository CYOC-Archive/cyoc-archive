<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before beginning, I would like to make two disclaimers.  I am changing the tense to the 2nd person.  (Referring to the protagonist as you.)  Secondly, I am changing Ty&#39;s origin story.  He&#39;s still going to get the same powers, but just a different beginning.  Plus, I&#39;m going to start with setting a scene/meeting the character.  Anyway, enjoy!<br />

<br />
Meet Tyler Lawrence Hill.  In fact, that&#39;s you!  You are a 16 year old junior in Thousand Oaks High School.  Your family is a standard middle class family.  Your brother, Dustin James Hill, is currently 17.  He&#39;s one of the most popular seniors in the school, and he constantly reminds you of it.  Did I say brother?  I mean half brother.  You were adopted.  However, your parents treat you and your brother as equals.  Your brother and you do not have a very good relationship though.  You wish you and your brothers were friends, because your parents are constantly busy, making you feel very alone at home.  To describe you, you are a modest 5&#39;7&quot;, with an nonathletic build.  You&#39;ve tried to work out to gain some muscle, but nothing ever worked.  You&#39;ve always been interested in computers.  How they work, making them, using them, etc.  You dream of becoming a computer scientist.  You also do some theater in your school as well.  It&#39;s a hobby of yours.  You love video games, and for your 16th birthday, you customized a $3000 laptop and got it.  Granted, that was a bit much, but you agreed to a no Christmas present year for it.  It was worth it to you.  The reason why your brother&#39;s so popular is that he&#39;s the star quarterback for your school&#39;s football team.  On top of that, he got a full ride scholarship to University of Alabama for his football skills.  He is big, athletic and smart.  He&#39;s also had a relationship with a cheerleader for three years, and she&#39;s going to Alabama too.  You personally are Latino, so you have tanned skin.  However, the rest of your family is white as milk.  English is your first language, but you are fluent in Spanish.  The date is March 24th 2016.  Another normal day of school, at least so far.  Let&#39;s see what happens...<br />
<br />
BEEP BEEP BEEP!  BEEP BEEP BEEP!  BEEP BEE!  Your alarm clock beeped.  At the eighth (eighth is a weird looking word) beep, you managed to silence it.  It was 6:45 AM in your house.  You yawned as you sat up in your bed, rubbing your eyes.  After about 2 minutes of stretching to wake yourself up, you took your shower.  It was very nice.  By the end of it, you felt wide awake.  It was 7:00 now.  You put on your bathrobe, and walked downstairs to eat breakfast.  Sitting at the table was your father reading The Acorn, the local newspaper, and your mother reading the Los Angeles Times.  &quot;Anything interesting?&quot;  You asked as you poured a bowl of Frosted Flakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today.&quot;  Your mother replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a shame.&quot;  You yawned as you stuffed your face full of cereal.  &quot;You know, I wish I had a sleep in like my brother.  I never feel awake in the mornings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe when your a senior.&quot;  Your father said, sipping some coffee.  Not much else happened during that breakfast.  Once you finished, you walked back upstairs, got dressed, brushed your teeth, and got your stuff ready for school.  By the time you were finished, it was 7:40.  20 minutes to get to school.  That was your normal margin.  You waved goodbye to your parents and started walking to school.  During your walk, you started to feel weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird.  I feel like something&#39;s inside of me.  It doesn&#39;t feel bad, but it doesn&#39;t feel good.  What the hell is this!&quot;  You thought to yourself.  Your pace began to slow down.  You looked at your watch, and noticed that it was already 7:55.  You were only halfway to school, and it started in 5 minutes.  &quot;Crap!  I&#39;m going to be late!  I need to get there now.&quot;  You thought.  All of the sudden, you saw the school right in front of you.  You looked at your watch again and it said 7:55.  &quot;What just happened?&quot;  You asked yourself.  &quot;That&#39;s not normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ty!&quot;  Someone yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Nick!&quot;  You yelled back.  Nick was your best friend, and often your teammate in games you play together.  &quot;Something really weird just happened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;  Nick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was feeling really weird on my walk here, and I noticed that I was running late.  All of the sudden, I was here!&quot;  You explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have been sleep walking.  Walking to school can be so mindless that you can put yourself to sleep doing it!&quot;  Nick laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that must have been it.&quot;  You said as you walked to your next class.  &quot;See you in Calc!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya!&quot;  Nick yelled.  You figured that Nick was right, but you couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something else happened.  <br />
<br />
You made it to your first class on time..  English.  English was your least favorite subject.  Sometimes, you wished it would end before it started.  Today was no different.  As you sat at your desk, you made the same plea in your head.  &quot;I wish this class would end already.&quot;  However, this time, you noticed that the clock said 9:00 instead of 8:00.<br />
<br />
&quot;Class dismissed!  Period 2 now!&quot;  Your teacher yelled in her obnoxious voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, something is definitely going on!  What is it!  I want to know!&quot;  You thought to yourself as you walked to your next class, AP Computer Science.  The weird thing was that even though English clearly never happened from your perspective, you still retained the information that was taught.  &quot;Hang on.  I think I have an idea.  The walk, English, I must have some kind of power.  I need to know though.&quot;  You continued thinking.  &quot;I just wished I knew what was going on.&quot;  As soon as you finished your thought, you found a letter in your hand.  It was addressed to you, but there was no stamp, and the return address just said destiny.  You knew nobody put it in your hand because you were the only one in the hallway.  You opened it and read the letter to yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Tyler,<br />
 You are a special boy.  More special than anyone in the world.  You are not just an ordinary boy.  You are a demigod, and a powerful one.  You are completely omnipotent, immortal and omniscient.  You can do anything you choose.  Nobody can stop you.  This is your destiny.  The only rule is that you cannot tell anyone else of your power.  Otherwise, it will be revoked.  Anything you do to change anything will bend reality to make people believe it was always that way.  Now, enjoy you power.<br />
<br />
Destiny&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  I&#39;m a god.  I don&#39;t think this could be any better.&quot;  You thought to yourself, bringing a smile to your face.  Immediately, you willed school to be over.  The bell rang, and everyone exited their classrooms.  Because school was over, you started walking home.  You didn&#39;t have anything after school that day.<br />
<br />
When you entered your house, you mother asked a very familiar question.  &quot;How was school today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was school.  Nothing interesting happened.&quot;  You lied.  &quot;I&#39;m going to my room.  Homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you when your done!&quot;  You mother smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be a while.  I have a lot to do.&quot;  You smiled as you walked up to your room.  Once you closed your door, you willed time to freeze for everything but you and what you needed.  To make sure it worked, you went downstairs.  You noticed your mother frozen in place, and none of the clocks moving.  &quot;Perfect.&quot;  You thought to yourself.  &quot;Now, there are going to be a lot of changes around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
End of chapter.<br />
<br />
Rules for continuation:<br />
Chapters should have some substance to them.  Make them decently long.<br />
Proper grammar and spelling would be nice.<br />
Indicate content in the chapter.<br />
Be consistent with the other chapters.<br />
Enjoy!</p>
