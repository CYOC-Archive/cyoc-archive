<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric found himself once more sitting on the curb beside the high school, waiting for the day to end. He still fondly remembered the first day he saw Spencer, getting out of her father’s jeep looking quite out of place. Part of his mind wondered why she didn’t wear glasses anymore, but more of it was thinking about his reading material.<br />
<br />
Behind the chemistry book he appeared to be reading, was the file Evan Lawson slipped him in the hospital last night. He’d only read a portion of it last night, which is why he was running late that morning. Spencer really hadn’t told him much in regard to Jeremy Bower. <br />
<br />
Eric found himself shaking with anger at her ex, and all the things he’d done to her. He didn’t understand how Spencer was so… passive about the whole thing. But Evan’s violent reactions suddenly made more and more sense. Eric figured he’s probably react the same way if it were his daughter who was hurt. <br />
<br />
The file mostly contained police reports from Virginia. Some about police responding to domestic disturbances, and 911 calls from neighbors about a fight in the adjacent apartment. But the more recent reports were much more severe and explicit. <br />
<br />
“…victim had multiple bruises on arms, legs and ribs. Suspect remained hostile while being arrested. Possible case of Stockholm Syndrome? Victim and suspect both deny a fight took place…” Eric read report after report like that. But the one he found himself staring at, and fighting back tears, was the last and most recent. Only a few weeks before the Lawsons moved to Moon Lake. <br />
<br />
“…on bail and met with victim the next day. Fight ensued, no witnesses could be found. Security footage shows victim entering motel alone, wearing a dark hoodie and jeans. Noted, had a backpack when entering, but backpack was missing when she exited. He started talking to her, mostly about running away. She refused, and told him she only came to end their relationship. He reacted in a hostile manner. When she tried to leave he stopped her. As the suspect is much larger, she couldn’t break free of his grip. He held onto her arm, and forced her down. Victim and suspect fought, broke several pieces of furniture during the struggle. Victim was eventually pinned against a wall, though she repeatedly kicked suspect’s legs and scratched his chest. Suspect proceeded…”<br />
<br />
Eric couldn’t bring himself to read anymore after that. He felt sick. He took a few deep breaths before stowing the folder into his backpack. <br />
<br />
“I don’t blame Spencer’s dad for being so angry. I just thought he was being a bit overprotective. I would want that jerk dead too.” Eric thought.<br />
<br />
Spencer’s exact words, regarding her relationship with Bower were, “he was really nice in the beginning. And he was my first serious boyfriend. But after a while he started getting pretty possessive, and agitated. I was stupid, made excuses for his behavior. Eventually it got to a point where I couldn’t ignore the truth, and I broke it off. He didn’t take that well, and you can already know what happened after.” <br />
<br />
She’d again lifted her feet to show him the scars. But that was just the the bare surface. <br />
<br />
“Eric?” Ben Twist had come up behind the younger Anderson, who appeared to be deep in thought. Eric jumped when he heard the voice behind him. He sprung up, and almost knocked his backpack over. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! Sorry Eric, didn’t mean to surprise you.” Ben said, helping Eric regain his balance.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay. I was just spacing out a bit.” <br />
<br />
“I could tell. You had the same look your brother has during AP Government.” Ben said. Eric nodded absently, still a bit out of it. The sick feeling he felt was slowly turning to pure rage toward Jeremy. Eric was starting to wish Spencer had bitten through Bower’s skull, AND his brain. He deserved that and so much more. <br />
<br />
“Um…” another voice said, coming up behind Ben and Eric. They both turned around and were equally surprised to find Julie Stovall standing there, looking quite nervous. Off to the side were the two girls Eric had seen with her during lunch. <br />
<br />
“Julie, hi.” Ben said awkwardly. <br />
<br />
“Can I talk to Eric for a minute?” Julie asked in a small voice.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Ben looked at Eric, not sure if Eric was up to talking. Whatever he’d been thinking about, it really sent Eric into a state. But Eric nodded yes, and directed Julie towards somewhere more private. They both felt their friends’ eyes burning into their backs. Eric stops beside a row of bushes on the far side of the parking lot. <br />
<br />
“What’s up Julie?” he asked once they were alone. <br />
<br />
“I… I just wanted to apologize. For, you know…”<br />
<br />
“Seeing someone behind my back?”<br />
<br />
“Uh ya, that.” Julie said. <br />
<br />
“Alright. You’re not just saying this are you?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“No.” Julie said, trying to be confident. It still sounded more like a question. <br />
<br />
“Who is Brian Walker anyway?”<br />
<br />
“You, uh know his name then?”<br />
<br />
“Well half our class is talking about him, so ya I know his name.” Eric said shrewdly. <br />
<br />
“He’s a junior. I’ve known him since we were in middle school. Our families would meet all the time at the lake, and we always hung out together.” Julie said. <br />
<br />
“And by ‘hung out’ you mean had sex?”<br />
<br />
“No! I mean, not at first. I didn’t start seeing him until recently. I went down to the lake, and he was there. He was… feeling frustrated about his dad, and I guess I was a little frustrated about… you know.” Julie said, or didn’t say. Eric knew what she was getting at. Not the part about Brian and his dad, but the part about his not jumping into bed with her, sure. <br />
<br />
“So, are you sorry or not?” Eric asked once more. <br />
<br />
“I…” Julie couldn’t bring herself to say it. She knew she should be, but at the same time if she hadn’t been seeing Brian on the side, she probably would have ended up forcing Eric into making the plunge (pun intended). <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry it didn’t work out between us, and I’m sorry I hurt your feelings.” she finally said. That at least was true. <br />
<br />
“Okay. See you around I guess.” Eric said. He and Julie went their separate ways, Eric walking back towards Ben, Julie to her girlfriends. Ben pretended he didn’t hear their conversation, but Eric didn’t care. He’d moved on, and Julie was just trying to save face. He doubted she meant anything she said. Maybe the bit about her being sorry things hadn’t worked out, but that’s it. <br />
<br />
Eric was now focused on going to see Spencer. After reading that awful collection of reports, and talking to Julie, he was more certain than ever that he wanted to spend his time with her. Maybe all of time with her, if that was possible.</p>
