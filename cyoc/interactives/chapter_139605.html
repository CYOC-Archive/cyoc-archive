<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">she lightly patted down her shiny dark brown hair once more in the mirror as she gave herself one last look over. her body brighter and softer than ever, she was going to make him realize that she isn’t so easy to break, that she in fact loved her new orange nylon skin adorning her whole body below the neck. she decided she would force him to watch her flaunt her new body and express how much she’s embraced it by wearing the sluttiest dress she could find--skin tight, short, and plenty of cleavage--along with a pair of flats she could easily slip off to air out her beautiful bright feet whenever she wanted. she was going to ruin him during class, completely turning the tables.<br />
<br />
walking into and through the hallways of school was rough; she barely thought about other kids’ reactions to her new body, but the more stares and jaw drops she got, the more the outcast and embarrassed feelings stirred, the more those negative feelings determined her to get her professor back by truly accepting her new self and showing off every part of it she could. she knew how much this response would drive him crazy, instead of the terror or regret he expected.<br />
<br />
when it came time for class, she slipped her orange body into the room quickly enough so she would go unnoticed at first, wanting to be something of a surprise to be seen by him. she slid into her desk, 3rd row from the front, 4 into the left, and waited. chest pressed out, orange legs folded over each other. she was really going to give him a show. <br />
<br />
her plan to go unseen until the start of class worked. he lifted his head up and stood at the front of the class, almost more confidently than usual, as he hadn’t noticed her come in at all. she softly chuckled, he was probably thinking he made her stay home, that the change made her feel too monstrous and hideous. his face dropped slightly after hearing her stifled giggle and as his eyes scanned over her luscious new colorful body, she knew he realized that she loved her new freakish appearance.<br />
<br />
after clearing his throat and briefly going through the class’s reading packet and questions to be done, he began to pass out papers separately instead of a certain amount per row. this made her smirk--he was trying to get a closer look at her. she turned on her charm, trying to heighten all of his senses. she stretched slightly, her soft orange arms traveling through the air around her, exposing the cleavage of her bright breasts as he almost stumbled toward her, his hands getting sweaty around the thick papers in his hands. she let out a soft sigh as she swooped her shimmery arms back down into her lap, feigning boredom as she placed her orange fingers against her cheek, leaning on them for support. finally arriving at her desk, he anxiously set down her papers and she could see the restraint in the front of his pants. she smiled at him, with an almost evil twinge in the corner of her lips as she graciously flipped through the packet with her pretty, supple skin. the look she got in return was an adorable mix of lust and frustration. her new body already had him wound tightly around her fingertips, and class had barely begun.<br />
<br />
<br />
as the packet drove the class to work, she took the time to silently seduce her professor and milk her freak body for all its sexiness was worth. she extended her radiant orange legs in front of her, using the toe of one shoe to slip off the other at the heel. her pretty, clown-like feet danced at her desk, wiggling her perfect toes in the air at just the right angle for his sight. she saw him stealing glances, clearing his throat, and adjusting his position behind his desk. she felt a familiar pool of wetness between her legs, knowing how he was responding to her behind that wooden shield, and she continued her show. she trailed one silky bright foot all the way up the skin of her opposite leg, getting chills at the way her fabric felt as it rubbed against itself. she threw her head back slightly, trying to contain the utter bliss she felt. on the way back down her leg, she spread her soft orange toes, pressing into the nylon skin, making sure he could see every single digit on its course back down her leg. she continued this intensely pleasurable process over and over, until she was turning on even herself a little too much. he sighed loudly, but this only spurred her on more. she intertwined 5 perfect orange toes with the other 5 and scrunched them up together, playing footsies with herself. her nylon palms were getting sweaty as the sweet, soft feeling sent vibrations throughout her body, specifically between her legs where her sex was now incredibly moist. she felt his eyes watching her feet tangle and weave together when she promptly stopped and let them dangle at the floor. he made a slight huffing sound, which gave her an idea of how to continue in a much more hands-on way.<br />
<br />
<br />
she looked at her pencil, sharpened to the tip. she pressed the lead into her worksheets, hearing the scratch and slight popping sound it made as it broke, and she got up from her seat. wrapped in her skin-tight dress, she sauntered her fluorescent body across to the front of classroom with only her bare nylon feet. she stood at the pencil sharpener, just a few feet away from his desk, and cranked the handle with her soft orange hand, winding around and around. she propped up one bare nylon foot on the carpeted floor, balancing half her weight on her colorful big toe, making sure her swooping arch was the only thing he could be focusing on while her other foot lay flat on the ground, pretty bright toes spreading against the classroom floor. her soft orange tits were squeezed together and flowing over the top of her dress and she knew her body had to be utterly torturing him at this point. she could feel his gaze burning holes in the nylon all across her skin. <br />
<br />
<br />
her heartbeat sped up and she felt a strong urge to straddle him right at that moment, wrapping her body around him in front of everyone and submitting to her new life as the sexy, colorful, clown fuck she knew he desperately wanted her to be. after she finished working over her pencil, she gathered herself and took her time walking back to her desk, so he could savor every last seam of her body on the way back, each colorful clown foot gracing the ground she walked on. she walked painfully slowly, so he could get a perfect look at her soft bright feet in motion, showing off her silky orange soles with each step. she sat, showing off her perfect orange fingers as she swirled them through her hair and twirled it piece by piece through each soft digit. <br />
<br />
<br />
looking up at the clock she noticed she spent more than half the class teasing and taunting him and decided to grab her pencil and get some work done, though she couldn’t do much to ignore the throbbing of her soaked, clown-colored clit that ached for his touch for the remainder of the class period. she decided to spend the rest of the class going through the packet with her legs and feet propped up onto the front of her desk. her smooth orange legs lifted up onto the cool metal and she arched and flexed her feet into the air, the supple orange skin that wrapped around their soles and toes reflecting perfectly in the fluorescent white lighting of the room. she settled her packet in her lap, right above her pantiless crotch, that she knew he now had a perfect angle of. she grew even more turned on as she showed off her silky and slick orange pussy lips that were glistening with her desire for him to slip his fingers between the soft, slippery, and colorful fabric. he let out a soft whimper that only she noticed as she spread her vibrant tangerine-colored legs for him a little wider, making sure to wiggle her toes as she continued her little show of what he wanted most, an irresistible view of his bright orange little alien fuck toy.</p>
