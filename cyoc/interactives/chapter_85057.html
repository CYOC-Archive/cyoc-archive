<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty returned from the park that afternoon with a newfound sense of confidence, both in himself and his powers.  He had walked pass families and dogs walking his obviously not-normal dog-girl on a leash and didn&#39;t get much of a first look, much less a second one.  Jennifer played the part, though the look of terror never completely left her eyes and her tail sagged.<br />
<br />
Walking in the door of his ramshackle foster home, he decided that there were going to be changes.  A lot of changes.<br />
<br />
June was the only one home and walked into the living room.  &quot;What are you doing with this dog?&quot; she asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s my new pet, Jennifer,&quot; he said with a smile.  &quot;Surely you can see who she is.&quot;  He snapped a finger.<br />
<br />
Junes expression slowly changed.  &quot;Jennifer?  What happened?  What is this?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s this,&quot; he replied.  In a split second, June was a near duplicate of Jennifer, complete with collar.  Ty willed a large metal dog crate and shoved her inside.  &quot;You&#39;ve been a bitch to me for so long, I thought you should fill out the role.&quot;  With that, the crate shimmered and vanished, leaving no trace.  <br />
<br />
Jennifer cocked her head at Ty, who shrugged.  &quot;I sent her to a breeder.  As far as anyone knows, she&#39;s a young dog ready to pop out puppies.  And she will for the rest of her life.&quot;  He rubbed his dog on the head, &quot;Just like you can if you don&#39;t behave.&quot;<br />
<br />
His foster dad came home next, tossing his keys aside.  He saw Ty laying on the couch and started to say something but all that popped out of his mouth was a loud &quot;Hee-haw!&quot;  He clasped his hands to his throat in confusion.<br />
<br />
Ty looked up, &quot;Hey there, jackass.&quot;  With that, Mike vanished into nothing.  He looked at Jennifer.  &quot;Oh, I&#39;m enjoying this.  He&#39;s going to find himself reborn a donkey in the next few minutes.  It&#39;s going to be confusing for him.  Especially when they geld him.  I might visit him someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin was the last one to arrive home.  He blew though the door, covered in sweat and puffing loudly.  &quot;Ty?!&quot; he screamed out.  &quot;I need you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He started tearing off his clothes as his body reshaped itself.  His body smoothed, his hair grew much longer.  His flat chest expanded greatly and as the clothes fell away, it was clear dustin wasn&#39;t a he any longer.  &quot;Oh God,&quot; she moaned, &quot;I need you so badly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin threw herself at Ty, who was more than happy to oblige his former foster brother in filling the need she felt.  He pumped her hard, smacking her on the ass until welts appeared, and she loved each second of it, getting hotter and hotter.  He came in her.  When he was spent, she turned and sucked him hard until he came again.  It was only then that he toned her down a little and let her rest.<br />
<br />
While she slept, Ty made a few alterations to the world.  He was suddenly an emancipated minor, decided to stay his own age for now.  The house was his and no one missed his foster parents.  Dustin became Didi, his hot girlfriend.  He made her 18.  Didi remembered being Dustin, but couldn&#39;t act on those memories.  He was trapped in a mental prision, forced to watch his altered body do horrifically degrading things to Ty.<br />
<br />
Though the following months, Jennifer played the part of the devoted pet.  She used the lawn as her toilet, played with the ball and ate dry dog food.  She would play witness to countless acts of petty revenge.  She wasn&#39;t sure how many of her former friends were altered by him.  Some with simple blemishes, a few with fates similar to hers.  A couple probably wished they had been killed.  Though it all, Ty would take her for walks all over the place.<br />
<br />
Literally.<br />
<br />
They walked the Great Wall of China, the jungles of Ecuador, and down Bourbon Street.  He took his girl and dog everywhere he wanted to see.  Unlike what he had done to his foster family, he had ultimately treated her reasonably well.  She understood she was a prisoner, and would be until he relented.<br />
<br />
One evening, a couple of years after he had transformed her, he looked at her laying on the floor.  &quot;Maybe it&#39;s time to let you go?&quot; he mused.  <br />
<br />
Jennifer raised her head.  Was he saying what she thought he was saying?<br />
<br />
He leaned back and looked hard at her, &quot;I think at least its time to let you make a choice.  I can&#39;t leave you like you are, a half human freak.  I had a lot of anger, and I took it out on a lot of people.  I need to correct some of that.  A lot of people have been punished beyond what I should have.&quot;  He sighed.  &quot;You&#39;ve been a really good dog.  I&#39;ll give you a choice.  I could return you to your human form, you walk out the door and you never tell anyone what happened.  If you do, you end up right back here and looking just like that again.  Other than that, no strings attached.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.  He continued.  &quot;I could also simply finish the transformation, make you my pet for the rest of my life.  Not your life, my life.  You&#39;d be well cared for.  You could even have puppies if you wanted.&quot;  He stood up, &quot;I&#39;m going to bed,  You can decide in the morning.&quot;</p>
