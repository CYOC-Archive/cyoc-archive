<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh! You want me to be the mother of your children Evan?&quot; Gwen asked clearly excited. &quot;Your divine dynasty will last for eternity Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh! I meant let&#39;s continue our work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!... I apologize Master, that&#39;s was pretentious of me,&quot; Gwen bowed, her naked breasts swaying in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s okay, this is all just still sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Evan.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ick! What are those things on his legs!&quot; Helga cringed and pointing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe they are called &#39;shorts&#39;,&quot; Gwen said, also seemingly off-set at the sight now her attention was drawn to them. <br />
<br />
And you remembered that with all your female creations, you had them as nudists, or effective nudists. You had effectively established a sense of &#39;normal&#39; to them. Jake had broken that sense of normal. You actually saw his neighbors were also looking at him dd. <br />
<br />
Sure, you were wearing jeans right now, but were you really &#39;part&#39; of the world anymore? Or were you now just like the artist of a work walking within the blank canvas as you brought your creation to life? <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess they are kinda out of place,&quot; you said rubbing the back of your head. Truth be told, you figured it was because you didn&#39;t want to stare at other guy&#39;s things forever. But Gwen and the others didn&#39;t care about such things, to them, covering yourself up was now the weird, none of the few universal traits they shared. <br />
<br />
Helga stretched out her black claws. &quot;Hey Jake, you just hold still for a second.&quot; And Helga moved in a flash, cutting away the front and back of Jake&#39;s shorts, exposing his package and rear exposed to the air, while leaving the strap and his pockets in intact. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO! Hey watch it dudette!&quot; Jake exclaimed covering himself. <br />
<br />
A flame formed on the tip of Gwen&#39;s tail, and it floated into her hands, and she brought it up to Jake&#39;s nose. The flame reflected in his eyes. <br />
<br />
&#39;There&#39;s nothing to worry about, nothing to think about. Nothing is wrong. You feel no embarrassment, humiliation, nor shame. You are Master&#39;s creation. You are beautiful.&quot; Jake&#39;s hands fell away, no longer seeming to notice or care about his exposure. &quot;Don&#39;t worry dude, I&#39;m available any time!&quot; <br />
<br />
You were stunned. Had they acted, ON THEIR OWN!? What were you expecting? You&#39;d made them as living creatures with their own consciousness&#39;, you hadn&#39;t made them as say, &#39;robots.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;There, fixed the new puppet boss,&quot; Helga said. &quot;Nothing to be embarrassed about. Even God did a do-over once after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right... girls, don&#39;t do that again unless it&#39;s something that&#39;s truly causing trouble.&quot; <br />
<br />
Helga rolled her eyes. &quot;Fine boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Master,&quot; Gwen bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;And boss, the &#39;catch&#39;?&quot; Helga asked. &quot;I&#39;d say that you were tricked into turning every humans on the planet to grey dull freaks was &#39;catch&#39; enough if you ask me! AND! She gave ya a chance to undo it all and give&#39;em back their thoughts, their lives, themselves. And what do ya do? Make foxy and me instead! Not that I&#39;m about to complain about, ya know, EXISTING, of course! But all the history and troubles you humans went through, poof. Doesn&#39;t matter anymore cause this wag slave was crowned king of the world for no good reason! ... That seems catch enough to me boss.&quot; Helga finished as she stood proud with her chest out with that ever present smirk. <br />
<br />
You lowered your head, Helga did have a point. You wondered if you&#39;d had Helga and Gwen come along so the two could offer different views on things to you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gwen, fix up Jake&#39;s house to fit him,&quot; you said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! I should have done that already! At once Master!&quot; And once again the blue flames from Gwen&#39;s tail floated from her, and spread like flash paper, consuming and remaking the building. <br />
<br />
The neatly kept lawn became beautiful white sand, the fence became made of drift wood. The one and a half story house was lifted a couple feet above the sand, and had many windows and doors with no signs of locks, which seemed to be a universal theme. After all, you hadn&#39;t introduced evil into this world. The wooden house was modest and laid back, like its owner. <br />
<br />
You also dimly realized that the houses all still had mailboxes all in the style of how Gwen had made them. You realized you weren&#39;t quite pleased with this. If you were gonna remake the world, you didn&#39;t just want it to be like the old world with a different coat of paint. <br />
<br />
You decided to walk up the other side of the street, checking out again the houses you&#39;d done between Helga and Jake. <br />
<br />
There was the pair of elf twins you&#39;d made. You&#39;d instructed them to be peaceful and polite and kind. And for their appearance to be that they could never be mistaken for human beings with ear props. They had the long ears, but they fanned out almost like feathers. Their eyes were larger, and were a solid color of green. Their hair was a metallic gold with a pattern on their scalp no human had. Their skin was pale, their necks long, along with their arms, fingers, legs, and torso. and the way their bodies moved, all said the same thing &#39;they were NOT human.&#39; <br />
<br />
Their house created by Gwen wasn&#39;t so much built as grown. White trees with silver leaves twisting upwards in a pointed spiral before stretching out into branches. Spaces between the tree trunks in the perfect shape of houses and windows. The tree itself twisted and moved as needed for its occupants. Crystals glowed from lamps and provided power for their own version of modern devices. The grass was covered in flowers that parted way for the occupants and guests. Even though Evan had made them and Gwen had reshaped their house herself, it was still hauntingly beautiful for him. The twins calmly played their music on harps and flutes, and waved to their creator and his two companions. Well, he&#39;d had Gwen come along Helga had invited herself. <br />
<br />
The fairies had been an experiment. He&#39;d commanded a single unit to divide into a swarm of individual fairies. The unit had become a mass of light, and broken apart into the doll sized beings. <br />
<br />
They were shaped like toddlers, and were as neuter as dolls themselves. They were creatures born of magic, and if they died they&#39;d return to magic. They ranged in colors from bright pinks, blues, and greens. Their eyes were solid colors like jewels, and their wings were a vast variety of shapes and colors. Their antenna gave off a pattern of twinkles. Their ears were those of foxes, cats, bears, and other mammals. <br />
<br />
Gwen had reshaped the house, cars, and play-set in the backyard into a single large tree, with several small apartments like hanging lamps hanging from the trees, with workshops and gardens within. It was like their little world. Each of the houses in the suburbs were like, even before Evan was given the ring, now it was just more obvious. The fairies played games each other with boundless energy without a care in the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you make candidates for the world boss?&quot; Helga had asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh? What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, are you making prototypes for how you want the world with each place here? Testing out the different &#39;flavors&#39; before you decide on a single theme?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... No reason the world can&#39;t have more than one theme.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, fair enough boss.&quot; <br />
<br />
The family of four who have lived next door to you you&#39;d ordered, <br />
&quot;Units. Become near identical brightly colored cat girl servants. Obedient. Loyal. Dutiful. Who take happiness and satisfaction in their work.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master,&quot; the four identical gray figures said together. <br />
<br />
Neon pink, green, blue, and yellow fur sprouted from their bodies as their heads took on a feline shape, their feet became digigrated paws, and a furry tail emerged where their tail bone would have been (you weren&#39;t sure the units had bones). Their body shapes became those of any otaku&#39;s fantasy. Pads formed on inside of their hands along with retractable claws. Their fur patterns with darker shades stripped along their bodies. They stood at attention, hands together and stood upright smiling at you. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are at your command Master!&quot; They said together, but with far more emotion and cheer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your names are Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, and Amber.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master!&quot; The four echoed again happily and a bit loudly. <br />
<br />
Gwen did not need to be told what to do... and it actually surprised you as her blue flames consumed their house... and the fence that had been between you and your neighbors, and their house actually fused with yours, in your mind&#39;s eyes you already guess it was now a guest wind and servants wing with supplies for them to keep your home spic and span until you chose to move somewhere else... or decided to start with scratch... you had so many units at your disposal, you could easily fill a house with custom anthro shaped objects and furniture. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get started right away Master!&quot; Ruby said for the group, and the four turned around and marched in step into the house their tails swaying hypnotically behind them, the sound of long overdue cleaning easy to hear once they were inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess they&#39;re a lot prettier to look at than the drab drones,&quot; Helga remarked. <br />
<br />
&quot;They seem a bit garish to me, but they are your creations Master, and yours to be as you please,&quot; Gwen nodded.<br />
<br />
The next single unit (ironically just before Jake&#39;s), you had commanded, &quot;Become an a amazonian wolf-woman, mighty, proud of herself, dedicated, and unquestioningly and blindly loyal to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As if you need the last part Master,&quot; The unit had shape as the first traces of personality settled into its mind. It grew larger, taller, the brown and white fur forming along its body along with a pair of bright amber eyes. Its furry tail forming, along with it short but pointed claws on its foot-paws and hand-paws. Its head shaped into that of a wolf, its bosom actually rather proper for its size. It grew taller than you, and looked down at you. <br />
<br />
She knelt down, &quot;Master, I am yours to command,&quot; she boomed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Beth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Beth, it is all I am. Command me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now, just keep in shape and do your part to keep the world&#39;s infrastructure running, with the whole world just blobs of clay, I don&#39;t think I need a bodyguard, but for variety&#39;s sake you&#39;re beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master,&quot; Beth said her head low. <br />
<br />
Gwen flames remade the house that had looked run down, dusty, and looked like it hadn&#39;t been cleaned in decades...  The result was a place build exactly to Beth&#39;s size and form (like the chairs having holes for their tail). Along with exercise equipment... and a laptop and books on economics. Gwen realized the full intent of what you&#39;d said even if you hadn&#39;t! <br />
<br />
Beth had gone inside... and immediately began to study! It was surreal seeing the hulking wolf amazon reading through the book. <br />
<br />
The last of the transformations already done was the rabbit, and Evan had this odd feeling he had recklessly rushed through them, which didn&#39;t feel right, when he&#39;d only done two so far. He should get the hang of this first. <br />
<br />
Evan had looked at the unit, trying to figure out where to let his whims take him next. <br />
<br />
Finally he just said to the sexless, identity-less thing, &quot;Become an anthro rabbit with a motherly figure, who is nurturing and warm, and devoted to her task.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you command,&quot; it said and its body changed as Evan had described. First its feet became extra long paws, its legs became muscular and bent, while a fluffy round tail appeared above her newly formed rear. Ironically, her figure was not as exaggerated as some of your other creations, being more comforting than alluring. Her fur was dark brown except fr her face and chest that were light brown. Her ears pointed upwards and kept reaching upwards, adding to her overall height. Her face pushed into a muzzle, a little pink nose and twitching whiskers, capped off with a set of buck teeth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Blossom.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my lord, I am Blossom,&quot; the rabbit woman said with a bow.   <br />
<br />
Gwen then did her thing. Gwen&#39;s blue flames consuming the house... ironically, the beautiful garden that had been in front of the house was mostly spared. Though a carrot patch was added where the grass had been. The small building became a three story house, almost like a tower. Painting in calming pastel colors and with beautiful rather innocent murals. <br />
<br />
That should have been that, until Blossom then asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master... would you please mate with me so I might raise your heirs, or at least give me young of my own so I might look after them?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gwen asked, &quot;Master... perhaps you should create a mate for her, the same breed as she?&quot; <br />
<br />
You kinda panicked, your creations suddenly asking you for things wasn&#39;t something you&#39;d actually expected, okay, Helga had asked for her home to be customized like Gwen&#39;s had, but you&#39;d already established that. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Revert to unit!&quot; You blurted out. <br />
<br />
Blossom&#39;s eyes widened... then whispered with a shudder, &quot;Yes Master.&quot; And Blossom&#39;s fur and figure, and face all smoothed away, leaving only the identity-less gray figure. <br />
<br />
Helga and Gwen stepped back from you, but said nothing. <br />
<br />
You took some breaths. And realized what you&#39;d done. You&#39;d given this unit an identity and self, and then wiped it away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unit... how are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am feeling peaceful, I am calm, I am nothing, I am no one, my body, mind, and soul are clay for you,&quot; the unit said, not feeling a trace of distress.  <br />
<br />
You shook your head. It was too easy. You thought before how if things didn&#39;t work out you could just undo things. This did bring up the existential question if any of the units were truly unique beings after you gave them traits, or if they were all play acting. The philosophical zombie question. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unit... take two pieces from your own mass... then become Blossom again, and the two pieces of yourself will become your daughters with independent minds, and you, Blossom, will name them herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The unit said. It reached into lower trunk where a stomach might be, and scooped out two pieces of its own gray flesh like indeed it was nothing more than clay. In then the transformation into Blossom began again, and the holes in the unit&#39;s flesh sealing up. Meanwhile, the blobs of flesh first took the shape of newly conceived Leporidae fetus&#39;, then grew into newborns by the time the unit had again become Blossom. Blossom let out a gasp, and shuddered, then looked down at her daughters for the first time. <br />
<br />
The twin rabbits had the same fur coloring as their mother, only inverted.  While Blossom&#39;s eyes were green, theirs was pink. Then they cried for the first time. Blossom brought the newborn rabbits girls to her breasts. <br />
<br />
Gwen took a couple of leaves, and with a flick of blue flame, created some cloth diapers that flapped in the air and wrapped themselves around the newborns. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your names are... Hop, and Rin... Mama loves you very much.&quot; She then looked at Evan. &quot;Master... I, I like being Blossom, please do not revert me, us, to a unit again? Please?&quot; Blossom seemed to hug her newborn protectively. <br />
<br />
&quot;As if anything the puppet says matters,&quot; Helga whispers lowly. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I wont,&quot; you say, feeling a bit dizzy from the incident. She&#39;d been a human being before, than a lump of clay, then one of your creations, then a lump of clay again, then you&#39;d taken that lump of clay and made Blossom and her two children she&#39;d wanted from it, why were you put off?<br />
<br />
On your quickly inspection, Blossom adverted her eyes, not wanting to do anything that might displease her creator. She had no emotional connection to the human she was created from, and now she had a stake in not only in her own existence, but that of her two children as well, even if they were technically the same age as her babies. <br />
<br />
You wondered about Helga. You hadn&#39;t given the detail of her being polyamorous. And you&#39;d never really been so yourself. So where did it come from? Was it a result of the traits you HAD given her interacting with each other? Or from the &#39;black box&#39; of her soul? You wondered if you should experiment later to see for yourself. <br />
<br />
You were almost out of units who&#39;d been by themselves. But you wondered. Had your wish brought all the units who had lived there right to that spot? Or had the homemaker been the only one home, and the bread winner and the children been away at school and work and would come home that afternoon? (Or never as the woman had hinted at if their job actually contributed to the infrastructure and wasn&#39;t getting coffee or printing a company newspaper). <br />
<br />
With that drama out of the way, you felt like getting back to mythicals for the last three single unit houses on your street (though that left every other apartment complex, homeless camp, mansion, and suburb in the world). <br />
<br />
You needed to get your mind off of Blossom, so you might as well go big. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unit. Become a red dragoness anthro. You are not afraid of violence, but loyal, you enjoy wealth, but are obedient, you take pride in yourself, and enjoy others appreciating yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master,&quot; The identical unit said. <br />
<br />
The unit grew in size, much like Beth, but its body was quickly covered in red scales, with golden scales along its underside. A long reptilian tail grew from its backside, followed by a pair leathery wings from its shoulders. While being a reptile in theory, a pair of melon sized breasts grew from its chest as the rest of its body followed suit. Golden claws grew from its fingers, and its feet became large talons. Its neck grew, and did a pair of pointed horns pointing backwards its her head. Her face twisted into a reptilian shout, its eyes golden. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Pyra.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon spread her wings, and breathed fire into the air. &quot;I am Pyra the mighty and beautiful!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How original,&quot; Helga said. &quot;But I guess all is original now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to criticize everything Master does?&quot; Gwen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s how I was made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen did her duty, and transformed the well kept looking house. Against conventional logic, the ground became a collection of volcanic rock, with small openings showing lava underneath. The house itself wave more of a cave that rose right out of the rock... a king&#39;s ransom of gold and jewels were scattered about, along with fire proof items necessary for living. <br />
<br />
You stared... Pyra was definitely hot, in more ways than one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Care to stay to stare in awe of my magnificence Lord Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, maybe later, I want to finish rounding out the block first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be my guest Lord Evan. Personally, by now I&#39;d have turned the entire place into my palace, and anyone in range into my obedient kobold minions by now. But that&#39;s just me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Keep that in mind.&quot; Transform yourself? Then again, with the magic users your could create, it was hardly impossible. <br />
<br />
One down, two to go. Next. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unit. Becomes a living female sphinx. But not one who&#39;d consume people for a wrong riddle! One with great knowledge and logic, a powerful sense of reason, and is willing to help me and answer any questions I might have or will have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master,&quot; The unit said as it always did. Then unlike your other creations, this unit got down all fours. It retained its opposable thumbs, but its lower body became that of a giant lioness, while its upper body looked built as a quadruped, but its front paws were still capable of grasping and using tools. A pair of feathered wings grew from its back. Its fur was golden and its wings blue. It ... remained &#39;bald&#39; in the sense of not having long hair, then again, that was normal for a lioness. Its eyes became dark brown. Its ears emerged looking like a cross between human and traditional feline. The familiar Egyptian eyeshadow formed on its face, but that might have just been its fur pattern. <br />
<br />
A pair of breasts grew from its chest, at a size that for the world had quickly had become the norm.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are going to name me Cleo, because it is the only Egyptian name you know. Helga is going to make a snarky remark about it. May I suggest Nubia for my name my Master?&quot; She spoke in a matter of fact way. <br />
<br />
You startled. That was out of the blue. Helga blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Nubia can be your name then,&quot; You say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gwen will now ask me not to second guess our Master unless I am asked to. I shall concede this, but I will fail, since it&#39;ll be easy for me to lose track of where in the chain of events I am. I will not spoil your surprise for Helga Master. It is quiet amusing.&quot; <br />
<br />
You were reminded of the blue guy from the comics who could see the future as easily as others could see the past. <br />
<br />
&quot;And yes Helga, Master&#39;s specifics has resulted in me being a seer who through sheer reason can see how things will go. But I cannot see the future of the units yet to be given a self, since they have no self to have a future, since the humans they were, simply no longer exist. I plead with you not to think too hard about that Master, or you will go mad. But I can calculate the actions of Master and you and the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your benefactor will be nervous of me Master, for whatever reason, I thought you&#39;d wish to know that. You wish to be on your way, as you wish Master,&quot; the sphinx, Nubia, bowed her head. &quot;I serve and obey.&quot; <br />
<br />
You were about to leave, when Gwen remembered she hadn&#39;t done her own job yet. Nubia didn&#39;t ask when Gwen turned around, and with her magic, remade the house that had belonged to a human being now wiped away as raw material for Nubia. Now the spot of land was covered in desert sand that never seemed to blow onto the sideway or into the neighbor yards (as seemed to be the case with all of them small worlds you&#39;d made). <br />
<br />
&quot;Trite, but serviceable,&quot; Nubia said without even turning around. <br />
<br />
That left one singles unit on the street. You walked up to it, and already know what you&#39;re going to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unit, become a shapeshifting Tanuki of myth, your name shall be the Japanese word for toy. You will be sexual active, be attracted to Helga, and know just what to say and what to do to please her. You will be clever and wish to see Helga be happy. You do what is needed of you. You will be loyal and grateful to your creator, me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Helga startled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The unit&#39;s fur pattern resembled a raccoons, but had patterns of brown fur instead of gray, and a far more panda like &#39;mask&#39;, and the tail wasn&#39;t stripped, just with a dark tip at the end. He grew a large belly and rear... but that was nothing compared to the pouch between his legs that rivaled the breasts of your creations. He grinned ear to ear, his bright brown eyes zeroed in on Helga. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hotness, name&#39;s Omocha, in your personal boy toy who aims to please! Those are some really great brains and brawn your got there. You don&#39;t see muscle and smarts together all that often, but you pull it off great, not like that the fluffy fern tree over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Gwen&#39;s voice cracked. <br />
<br />
Helga let out a chuckle. &quot;Look, I know you were custom made just for me, you know you were custom made just for me. So what&#39;s the point?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is that you wanna be pleased babe. You told big guy that you didn&#39;t wanna tire out hanging on the same cock every day? Well,&quot; Omacha&#39;s cock came out... and changed size, shape, becoming a horse&#39;s, then a cat&#39;s, then a mass of tentacles before shifting back. &quot;I can surprise you every time! Never gets old! Also, nice piercings, surprised you didn&#39;t go for the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the boss made me without those. I&#39;ll get&#39;em when I feel like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No time like the present!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. But the boss has been putting on a great show... except for maybe the part with the rabbits...&quot; <br />
<br />
Omocha reached out, his arms stretching, and pulled her in, resting her on his pouch. &quot;Hey babe, I&#39;m here. And as long as I am, I&#39;ll be there for ya. Whatever ya need, I&#39;m it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pst. That&#39;ll be fun for a bit. But it&#39;ll get old fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. How about I only change the best part of me? And the rest you&#39;ll just have to work with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really fatso?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you&#39;re the one who wanted some limits shorty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you even gonna get around with dragging that thing around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can make it travel size, and-&quot; his pouch morphed int a moped, Helga&#39;s tush in the basket. &quot;-I can provide my own travel if need be babe. ... But seriously, a babe as hot as focused as you deserves a guy who can mixed up, and I&#39;m as mixed up as they come! Ha ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I can see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, how can you NOT see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my line! But seriously, if you&#39;re made to please me, you know that a one trick pony is gonna bore me fast if sex is all you got.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m an all-tricks-pony!&quot; Now his sack shape shifted into a horse, still connected to him. &quot;See? And I enjoy pranks, insult contests, drums, shiny things, drinking still those around me can&#39;t see straight, and cheating at card games!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything that aren&#39;t mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I also enjoy haiku.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain...&quot; <br />
<br />
You and Gwen left Helga and Omocha to get acquainted. <br />
<br />
You were going to need more than a kitsune if you were gonna reshaped entire land masses eventually to truly make this a separate world. <br />
<br />
You came to a former family of three, the three units standing identically like all the rest. <br />
<br />
You pointed at two of the units at random. <br />
<br />
&quot;Units, one of you become the goddess of the moon to ensue the moon stays in orbit the tides remain, and the other the goddess of the sun it never enters red phase and dies. Ensuing my world&#39;s eternal survival.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two units shuddered. <br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s voice rang in your head. &#39;BEEP! BEEP! The creation of Class-C and above deific entities is not permitted in universes 2371 through 57338 without the consent of at least three Class-A deific entities or the consent of the class-S Deific Entity. Transformations into such creatures will proceed, though without the powers or authorities granted by deific status, whenever possible. Sorry, but there are still limits to this thing.&#39; <br />
<br />
Okay. That... was a lot to take in. Most importantly. This made clear a system for gods already existed. Which wouldn&#39;t need to be there unless gods already existed... That was a bit ... overwhelming... On top of everything that had happened today, you now had concrete proof to the existence of gods. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master? What went wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seem that gods that are &#39;C&#39; class, whatever that is, can&#39;t be made unless I got the &#39;S&#39; class, or three &#39;A&#39; class gods to rubber stamp it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Sorry Master... As a nine-tails tenko class kitsune, I would guess that I myself am at the limit of what divine entity you can create from units directly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Though you had no way of knowing it. Gwen worried that you being able to create such gods would mean that you had no further use for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. That might be a problem. Do genies count as class-C?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... not sure Master. Do you intend to create a genie of the sun and a genie of the moon to ensue they continue to provide for your planet for eternity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be worth experimenting later. I&#39;ve already had a few surprises with what I&#39;ve created already. I did want one so I could maybe move some land masses around so this place isn&#39;t just a remix of the old world if I&#39;m really gonna remake it period.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think of something Master,&quot; Gwen nodded.</p>
