<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pre-teen Emily glared at her friends as she threw the dice down, &quot;This is all your fault!&quot;<br />
<br />
When the dice hit the box they bounced, one of them bouncing right out of the box and rolling away. The die that remained in the box had landed on a one and Emily looked about ready to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not fair! I don't want to be a little kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, try to stay calm,&quot; Sandra begged while Tracy got up to look under the bed for the missing die.<br />
<br />
The state that Sandra was in only made Emily more upset. Having hooves like a horse and the ears and tail of a wolf was pretty neat compared to being stuck as an eleven year old, which made it worse that Sandra was trying to tell her to stay calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I'm calm,&quot; Emily snapped, &quot;While you guys find the dice I'll take my card and become a freak. I can move my piece once I know how I rolled. it's not like the card and what you roll are connected anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not so sure that's a good idea,&quot; Samantha started in, but Emily silenced her with a glare.<br />
<br />
Trying to reassure herself that it was just a stupid game, Emily took the card. Samantha was probably right, but at this point Emily was acting out of spite. Her friends were all idiots for getting her dragged into this and forcing her to go along with it. They should have quit after her first roll, but no, they wanted to keep going so she would keep getting cards and become a freak like all of them.<br />
<br />
The card she held in her hand was probably some freaky disgusting change, like maybe she'd turn into a lizard or some sort of bug. Yes, that was probably it, but she wasn't going to give any of her so called friends the satisfaction of playing along with it. Instead she tore the card in half and threw it to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid game, that's what I think of it,&quot; then she stood up and crossed her arms over her chest, &quot;When Tracy finds the other dice one of you can move my piece for me. I'm done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra stood up as well, &quot;Emily, please - &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Emily stomped her foot down, narrowly missing the game board, &quot;I took my turn and picked my stupid card. I didn't break the rules. The game never...&quot;<br />
<br />
She trailed off, staring up at Sandra. The red haired girl seemed taller suddenly, the hooves might have been part of it, but at the same time Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was even more wrong than it had been before. Next to her Samantha let out a soft gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Emily turned to give her a dirty look and nearly fell over in the process when her pants fell down, &quot;How the...&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked down at herself and saw that her shirt was hanging off of her like a blanket and realized that Samantha, who was still sitting down was at eye level with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo!&quot; Emily sobbed as Sandra reached for the torn halves of the card.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to yourself,&quot; she said flatly, then read the card for all of them to hear, &quot;This game isn't mean - It's supposed to be fun - But if you want stop playing - And regress down past one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Emily whimpered, &quot;I'll keep playing, I don't want to be a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was too late and she knew it. She could feel herself continuing to shrink down, feel herself changing further, losing muscle tone and growing baby fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-please, make it stop,&quot; her legs started to grow weak, her balance unsteady, &quot;I'll pway nice. I wanna be a big girl 'gain.&quot;<br />
<br />
She struggled to get the words out as her mind started to grow fuzzy. All of this was so confusing and frightening that she just wanted to cry. It was getting harder and harder for her to stand up so she tried to sit down, only to overbalance herself.<br />
<br />
Unable to stop herself, she hit the floor and looked up at Samantha, who looked so very big now, &quot;I fwell down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying not to cry she held her arms out to Samantha, begging for her friend to help her up, even as her arms began to grow heavy. She looked at her pudgy little fingers, sticking out of the ends of the sleeves of her shirt, &quot;Up pwees.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to ask for help, but the words got tangled on her tongue, just like she was tangled in her own shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna up,&quot; she tried again, &quot;Fwell an a dah ah ah up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha said something, but Emily found that she couldn't understand the words. What she could tell was that Samantha was reaching for her, a look of concern on her face. The way she picked Emily was awkward because of the weight of her massive breasts, but Emily was glad for it. She hugged Samantha as best as she could, which was nothing more than snuggling against the weight of her big, warm breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tannn ah ah nnh,&quot; she thanked Samantha, reassured by the warmth and the contact, &quot;Mmm aaah dah ah mmmm aaa.&quot;<br />
<br />
She cooed happily as she snuggled down. Pressed against Samantha she felt so safe and relaxed, the only problem, if it could even be considered a problem, was that being next to Samantha's breasts was making her hungry. She could smell something wonderfully sweet and rich, which she instinctively knew to be the milk that those huge breasts were making. <br />
<br />
Her eyes locked on one of Samantha's huge nipples which was tenting the fabric of her shirt, big and plump and just right for sucking. It would be so good and so nice. Maybe if she were to ask nicely Samantha would lift up her shirt and let her nurse from that big, yummy nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm ma ah am ah?&quot;<br />
<br />
She could hear the others talking. A man, Tracy, sounded happy and Sandra sounded upset as she and Samantha talked, but all Emily could focus on was Samantha's chest.</p>
