<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning came as it normally did and carried knowledge that things were progressing ever forward.  As Jenny rolled over to the playing of music that Friday morning, she had a great mix of feelings. There was happiness and excitement as her wedding was now a day closer and she&#39;d soon legally be the wife of Harold Jenkins, who her bond told her was the only one she would ever love and be with. She looked to see him looking back at her with his calm and friendly eyes and she felt great happiness at that. She couldn&#39;t see herself with anyone other than Harry. But that happiness wasn&#39;t the only thing that hung over her.<br />
<br />
There was also some nervousness over the situation with her family and with Dieter Wilhelm. Her parents were bound to be difficult in that they had had a hard life and wanted to get out of their position in Alabama. In a way she understood that, but her father had taken it to a point that had gone to the point where the thing Jenny wanted most was to get away.  It hurt even more that her mother seemed to agree with her father and could often be just as bad as him. Her brothers weren&#39;t too bad, and in a way, she did respect her older brother, as he often tried to shield her and the younger siblings, but he was older than her and had his own future lined up. According to letters and emails she&#39;d gotten, she thought he had a good job with a computer developer or a repairman or something like that.<br />
<br />
But with her family, her biggest concern remained with her parents, as they could reject her utterly when they realized just how much she&#39;d changed after becoming a werefox. That would be bad news for her younger siblings, who her older brother wouldn&#39;t be able to protect from her father and mother while he was also off at college. That sort of worst case scenario was something that made Jenny fairly nervous. She felt confident that she could stand up to her father and she privately wished that he would see reason and thus let their family relationship remain a family relationship, even if somewhat strained, but that didn&#39;t remove her fears on the possible worst case scenario on the family front.<br />
<br />
The biggest threat was Dieter Wilhelm. His family owed their wealth to winning the Alabama state lottery and then essentially living as though they lived on a much lower yearly salary. It let Dieter run a local power company in the town where the Harper family lived and yet have more money than what his salary would actually earn. Wilhelm directly employed Jenny&#39;s father and had used that connection to obsesses over her, and despite the fact that Wilhelm was something of a skunk in terms of his behavior, her parents seemed to think that Wilhelm would help them if Jenny married him. That obsession was another reason for Jenny to want to get out of Alabama. And so far, he had proved that to be a wise decision in that he had sent agents to Moon Lake to kill Harry and break up the wedding. One of his plots had even gotten Harry&#39;s brother shot. Jenny didn&#39;t think her father knew of Wilhelm&#39;s plans for murder, but she also knew that Dieter had pulled the wool over her father&#39;s eyes enough that he might not easily believe anything bad about Dieter Wilhelm.<br />
<br />
It was the happiness at the wedding&#39;s cementing her union to Harry, nervousness over how her parents would react to the new her, and something that could almost be a mix of fear and even outright hatred for Dieter Wilhelm and his lack of real morals on any level. As she sat up in the bed she presently was sharing with Harry she gave a heavy sigh to get everything under control.<br />
<br />
&quot;You doing okay?&quot; she heard Harry speak to her as she stood up.<br />
<br />
Jenny stopped and looked over her shoulder to see Harry also sitting up and something to wear before getting in the shower. She gave a small smile to him, as while there were plenty of things to worry about, she was doing fairly well. She figured she&#39;d join him and if they hurried there might even be some time for some fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m doing good,&quot; Jenny said with a smile and crouched down by a duffel bag laying on the floor on Jenny&#39;s side of the bed. From it, she pulled a clean pair of underwear that she would wear for the day. &quot;A new day dawns and our becoming Mr. and Mrs. Harry Jenkins comes a day nearer. That&#39;ll be good... and in a way... it&#39;ll be a relief to get through it. For good and for bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry slowly nodded at that, &quot;Yeah... I just wanted make sure you weren&#39;t nervous over anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I say anything in the night?&quot; Jenny asked. She felt she&#39;d slept fairly well, though she&#39;d occasionally had some nightmares that related to either her transformation or to her family issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Harry spoke, &quot;but... with all the other stuff going on... I&#39;m not sure on how you&#39;d feel with only a day to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are mixed,&quot; Jenny gave a sigh as she stood up from her duffel bag with clean clothes for the day in her hands, &quot;Happy that we&#39;ll soon be husband and wife, nervous over family issues, and extra nervous over what Dieter Wilhelm might pull. I can&#39;t really separate those feelings... which will have all the more relief once we&#39;re through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m with you on that,&quot; Harry gave a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because we have class and then my last therapy session before the wedding,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;let&#39;s get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny then turned to head toward the bathroom across the hall from Harry&#39;s room, swaying her hips as she went. She couldn&#39;t help but smile when Harry quickly gathered up clean clothes and then followed after her. He had a very happy smile and based on where his eyes were looking, there was only one thing he could be looking at. Jenny only let her hips continue to sway as she walked.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
After a quick shower, Harry and Jenny soon arrived in the kitchen to find Lisa and Henry both up and readying breakfast. Harry could even smell the eggs cooking as he and Jenny had come toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys didn&#39;t have to cook,&quot; Harry said to his parents, &quot;Jenny and I could both handle something quick that wouldn&#39;t be in your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you aren&#39;t dear,&quot; Lisa answered, &quot;It&#39;s just that we will have a lot on out plate today ourselves. I&#39;ll admit to being a bit anxious about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry waved spatula that he&#39;d been dealing with the eggs with to urge Harry and Jenny to take a seat. They did so, though there was some confusion that was evident on both Harry and Jenny&#39;s faces. This could be seen in their raised eyebrows and the fact that both of them remained focused both Henry and Lisa. Eventually Henry gave a small smile to the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;With Huck being released from the hospital this afternoon, we intend to have things ready so we can go and pick him up,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;that includes getting food and making sure we can fold the couch out for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huck would probably want to be at home... or to at least get what he&#39;d wear to the wedding tomorrow,&quot; Harry pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s one of the things we&#39;ve been thinking over,&quot; Lisa answered, &quot;We may stop by his place and get what he needs, but we will bring him and make sure he&#39;s fully recovered. After all, they are releasing him from the hospital... and a were&#39;s ability to heal or not... that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll be one hundred percent ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Betty?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;what if she wants to take Huck home and care for him there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be something to discuss... but not something we can discuss until we get there,&quot; Lisa answered, &quot;Either Henry and I look after our son or Betty looks after him. Either way... I&#39;d like to be there when Huck is released from the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked to Harry. She knew that Harry would want to be there for his older brother, and even she did want to be there for him. Huck&#39;s wounding was one of the things that fueled some of her feelings of anxiety that related to dealing with Dieter Wilhelm. She wanted to be there to make sure he would be okay when released as a means to say that she was sorry that her own family issues were giving people in Moon Lake trouble, but between college classes, her therapy session, meeting with all the people from the Skulk who were part of the wedding planning for rehearsals and talking with the minister and so on, before ending the day with the pre-Halloween Skulk meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think we&#39;d all like to be there,&quot; Harry spoke, &quot;be we have a lot on our plate today...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Huck would want you both to be ready for your wedding,&quot; Henry said to him, &quot;don&#39;t worry. We know Huck will be perfectly fine. Don&#39;t worry and go through your day with the knowledge that soon... you&#39;ll be legally married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny soon smiled and even nodded.</p>
