<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steph&#39;s preferences had made you a really short girl. You figured it was fair to do something similar to her with the &quot;Playful Pixie&quot; option. Also, Steph had always been a very calm person with a cool demeanor. When you first got to know her back then, you found her a bit intimidating at first. It would be interesting to in a way take that away, making her a bit more approachable, perhaps easier to date.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ve found one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Steph smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me. Just get me that drink, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You did as told. You scuttled out of the seat. You went to the counter. You showed the bartender the menu and pointed towards &quot;Playful Pixie&quot;, and then at Steph. Ypu also mentioned that she wanted it to be a surprise. She told you it&#39;ll be there in a moment.<br />
<br />
You returned to Steph.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a little exciting,&quot; Steph said. &quot;I hope you didn&#39;t pick anything too weird, but I did let you pick whatever, so I guess that would be on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you what I picked if it helps,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no. Don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the bartender arrived with the drink. &quot;Surprise transformation liquor?&quot; she said and looked at Steph.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s for me. Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph recieved the drink in front of her, and just as she recieved it, she took a first sip. &quot;It tastes good at least,&quot; she commented.<br />
<br />
You looked at her, expecting something to change. She noticed you staring. &quot;It&#39;s not immediate,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s slow like your change was, but hey, you&#39;ll probably notice it befote me because you know what to look for. I tried to sed if I can taste what you picked, but I had no idea, not like I know what to tasye for anyways. I imagine they probably all taste the same, just with different magic stuff.&quot; She smiled, then took another sip. &quot;Hmm. I do wonder what you based your decision on. Was it something you figured would be fun, or was it more like something you want from a partner in like a more permanent basis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I guess I picked something that would let us know each other better. Like you&#39;re always a bit closed off, or at least it feels like I can&#39;t discern about your emotions even if I&#39;ve known you for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me you didn&#39;t pick the bimbo one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t.&quot; You said, but back then you did actually consider it for a moment. It just seemed like a little much to push on someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I wouldn&#39;t have blamed you if you did. I did say you could pick anything.&quot; She took another sip of her drink.<br />
<br />
You looked at her if you could discern any changes, and you could. Her blouse did seem to hang looser off her. You looked at her face, and while you did look for differences, you also just looked at her, admiring how pretty she is.<br />
<br />
She looked back at you. You held eye-contact for a few moments until Steph let out an unchacteristicly animated giggle. She took another sip of her drink.<br />
<br />
You noticed her brown hair being shorter. She&#39;d always kept long to her mid-back, but now it was shorter, just lomg enough to frame her face. And looking at her face, it seemed rounder, a little cuter, with her eyes appearing larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m shorter,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; You were both sitting, so it was difficult to tell how much, but it did seem like she was a bit shorter.<br />
<br />
Steph sprung up and stepped aside. &quot;Come stand next to me.&quot; She ushered for you to come.<br />
<br />
You did as so. You stood up and stood next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am still taller than you,&quot; she boasted. &quot;But it&#39;s not over. Was yhis your idea? Bringing me down to your level?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t the main thing.&quot; You hadn&#39;t considered height too much, but now looking at the shorter Steph, it did make a big difference especially considering proportions, where Steph had long legs before, kind of a super-model-look. She&#39;d lost that completely, now being more cute.<br />
<br />
Steph patted her chest. &quot;My boobs!&quot; She exclaimed. There was no outward curve at her chest. She appeared flat. &quot;Bye bye boobies,&quot; she said wistfully. Then she rushed behind you and grabbed yours. &quot;I&#39;ll survive having small boobs if I get to play with yours. You have more than enough for both of us,&quot; she giggled. She hefted your boobs up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; you protested. &quot;There are people around us.&quot; You blushed.<br />
<br />
She stopped. &quot;Relax sugarcrumbs. It&#39;s a lesbian bar. They won&#39;t mind. But if you&#39;re uncomfortable with it, I won&#39;t do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph returned to the table aand took another sip, the last sip. She&#39;d finished her drink already.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know what you picked,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?&quot; you asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the pixie one, like playful pixie or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the one,&quot; you confirmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I figured since I was getting small, and I&#39;m bursting with energy, like you have no idea.&quot; She did a few jumps up and down in place, during which, her now too large blouse slid down her shoulder together with her bra, revealing her slim torso and a pert pair of breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, snap!&quot; She laughed. She pulled her blouse up, covering herself. &quot;Clothes change last, so I guess I just have to hold this thing up until then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you getting younger?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t be, I think. Well, I guess I could change my id later on, after my clothes and everything else change, but I am pretty sure I am just a small 23 year old. Well, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re any taller than me.&quot; She measured herself next to you. &quot;We&#39;re the same height now, but I guess no one is going to think you&#39;re too young because of your, well you know.&quot; She gestured a big outward curve at her chest with her one free hand. &quot;Your humongous honkers.&quot; She then giggled.<br />
<br />
You took another close look at Steph. She was very skinny. While you had similar heights now, your builds were complete opposites. Where you were curvy and thick, she was small-framed and skinny.<br />
<br />
Then, Steph&#39;s clothes shifted on her. Her blouse shrunk until it was a snug fit. &quot;Yay!&quot; she cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean the changes are over?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;They should be,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess this is me now.&quot; Again, she measured herself with you. &quot;I am actually shorter than you. Unbelievable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe. I think it&#39;s cute,&quot; you said and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that&#39;s an upside, but there is another upside.&quot; She had an excited expression. &quot;Like now, you seem like way curvier from my point of view, you know. Like I wanted you shorter than me, but now it&#39;s actually kind of hot, like I can&#39;t wait until we&#39;re alone for some fun, like just look at my hands. There are teeny.&quot; She held her hand up in front of you. &quot;Feeling you up is going to be so much fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a perv,&quot; you teased her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hihi. Maybe I am?&quot; She giggled. &quot;What do you say we head to my place. I&#39;ll show you how much of a pervert I can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gladly.&quot; You smiled.<br />
<br />
The two of you stepped out together. You noticed how Steph almost had a bit of a skip to her step. Cute.</p>
