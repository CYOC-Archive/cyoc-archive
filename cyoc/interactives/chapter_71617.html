<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karyn made sure to take her cell phone, which had been left on the kitchen counter.  We went upstairs to her <br />
room.  Her room was at the end of a long hallway so we would know if her sisters broke their promise.  She <br />
opened the door to her room and sighed in relief.  “At least they didn’t do anything in here,” she said.  She <br />
looked around the room and added, “It doesn’t seem like there’s anything different here.”<br />
<br />
“Except that your clothes are probably a little different,” I said.  She nodded.  “By the way, how did you <br />
know what your bro…uh, sisters have been doing?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t,” she admitted.  “They’re always usually up to something, so I bluffed.  Worked, didn’t it?” she <br />
grinned devilishly.  <br />
<br />
I chuckled.  “I would say so.  Was Cady hitting on me?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I really don’t know,” Karyn replied.  “I can’t really tell.  Something inside me tells me that he…shit, SHE, <br />
has.  I guess that’s why I got so mad.  But look at both of them.  They’re changed like you, but they acted <br />
just like they always have.”<br />
<br />
I sat down on the bed and Karyn followed suit.  “Maybe this change hasn’t affected everyone’s personality,” I <br />
said.  “Or maybe it’s an effect of puberty.”<br />
<br />
“Something to look forward to with Leah,” she said.<br />
<br />
“I don’t relish that thought,” I said.  “She’s really such a sweetheart, it’s going to be weird to see her act <br />
like an teenage male.”<br />
<br />
“Good thing she has such a great big sister to help her out then,” Karyn teased.  <br />
<br />
“Good thing I have you to help me,” I said.  We both laughed.  For the next minute or so I just looked around <br />
her room to see if anything looked different to me.  It was mostly as I remembered it.  In doing so I <br />
remembered the last time that we were in Karyn’s room together.  We were both bored, but feeling a little…<br />
restless, shall we say.  Karyn decided that she wanted to give me a blow job and I didn’t resist.  Like she <br />
had reminded me earlier, we’d had casual sex a few times, but this was the first time we had done something <br />
other than regular intercourse.  It made me feel weird afterward, though Karyn didn’t seem to do the same.<br />
<br />
“So,” I said.  “You were pretty hot downstairs.”<br />
<br />
She looked at me curiously.  “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Like you were really mad,” I said.  “Ready to just hulk out or something.”  This is what I said to Karyn, but <br />
my honest feelings were that she was hot in the sexual sense.  Tearing into her sisters made me slightly <br />
aroused.  I didn’t know why, because it was not something I’d find arousing before my change.  Perhaps I was <br />
aroused because it was Karyn.<br />
<br />
“So what?” she answered.  “They deserved it.  If they’d broken anything valuable, I’d never hear the end of <br />
it.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” I asked as I inched closer to her.<br />
<br />
“Your mother might be different,” she said, “but I just don’t think my parents will be.  This isn’t the first <br />
time they’ve just gone on an ‘overnight trip’ like this.  They expect me to take charge and if something bad <br />
happens, it’s always my fault because I didn’t keep those two idiots in line.”<br />
<br />
I could see that she was getting angry again.  This would work to my advantage, I thought.  “That sucks,” I <br />
said.  I placed my hand on her thigh and patted it gently, in a sympathetic manner.  <br />
<br />
“You’re lucky you just have Leah for a sister,” Karyn said.  “She might be nosy, but that’s the worst thing <br />
about her.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea,” I agreed.  My hand began to move closer and closer to her penis.  She still didn’t take notice of <br />
what I was doing.  “It’s not fair because you’re not the problem.”  My hand reached her penis and I softly <br />
touched it with the back of my hand.<br />
<br />
This brought her full attention to me.  “Joey, what are you doing?” she asked.  I took her penis in my hand <br />
and began to stroke it.<br />
<br />
“Returning a favor,” I answered.  Then I whispered into her ear, “Just let me do this.”  I stroked her penis <br />
harder and the effect was obvious on her face.  She moaned softly and closed her eyes.  “You’ve got me so <br />
turned on, that I just have to suck your cock.”<br />
<br />
“Joey!  I’ve never…uh…heard you say that,” she said as my stroking increased in speed.<br />
<br />
“I do now,” I said.  I slid off the bed but did not release her cock.  I wanted to get it nice and hard before <br />
I went down on it.  I positioned myself in front of Karyn.  She moved a little closer to the edge of the bed.  <br />
Once I was satisfied with how hard she was I leaned down and enveloped her cock in my mouth.  <br />
<br />
Instantly she began to moan much louder.  I went up and down on her cock and as I did my head bobbed up and <br />
down slightly.  Karyn put her hand on my head and kept it forced down on her.  I didn’t mind at all since this <br />
told me she enjoyed it.  It also had the effect of making me go faster.  Karyn responded by moaning louder and <br />
longer.  I kept going as fast as I could.  Suddenly I felt her cock buckle and waves of warm liquid shot into <br />
my mouth.  Karyn climaxed loudly, let go of my head and fell backward onto her bed.  I eagerly swallowed every <br />
bit of her cum.  It tasted weird but simultaneously it felt completely natural.<br />
<br />
Once I was satisfied that she was done I released her cock from my mouth.  Karyn was still down on her bed, <br />
her eyes closed and small beads of sweat covering her body.  She continued to moan softly, as if the <br />
experience had overwhelmed her.  Suddenly I had another idea.</p>
