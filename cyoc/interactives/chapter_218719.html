<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trish pushed Julie back into the changing rooms, knowing what was likely to happen next would require some privacy. Julie, for his newness to being male was too caught up in the strange sensations flooding his... his? He looked down at his veiny and erect penis and instinctively knew it was definitely HIS head that was under barrage from this flood of hormones telling him that he had to fuck and fuck right now, and so as Jules was pushed back into a changing room by a pregnant sales clerk his brain was beginning to recognize as &quot;Trish&quot;, he began to respond cupping her bra-bound breasts and pulling her in for a kiss.<br />
<br />
As Trish kissed, she felt a connection made which sent a chill down her spine and right to her belly, where she knew that she&#39;d have to act fast to save her son and daughter. For if they regressed without a part of their sperms with somewhere to go, then that half of them would forever be lost--that was how the spell on the store worked and how many a sales clerk had gotten rid of any unwanted and unexpected pregnancies with clumsy customers. However, if there was some place for the sperm halves of her babies to go, then there was a brief window afterwards where they could be reunited with their egg halves and refertilized. It just required having sex while the regression took place.<br />
<br />
Luckily with Jules&#39; transformation now complete, his clothes were fully off him--having shredded in the transformation, and the only barrier now between his penis and her vagina were her panties, as by now he&#39;d moved from playing with her breasts that had begun to shrink as the milk in them was beginning to dry up, to her pants which he&#39;d expertly pulled off of her while still making out. By now she was barely two months along, and Trish dug her thumb under her waistband and pulled the panties down as she felt all sense of a pregnant belly shrink out of her--she had a few moments. Taking the lead with Jules, Trish invited his rod into her waiting cave and started to rock and coax Jules--their breathing speeding up.<br />
<br />
Inside of Trish the fetuses that had been Megan and Jason undeveloped to the point of pulling off of her uterine wall and becoming just fertilized eggs. And then, not even fertilized as their sperm halves were forced out of the eggs and sent backward towards a strange current that pulled them further and further away from the eggs until they were pulled into a long warm tube only to find themselves among plenty of other sperm.<br />
<br />
Jules panted as he felt a weird sensation of having sucked something back into himself instead of his usual ejaculation--that only meant he had to chase that ejaculation further and so Jules took over as the partner initiating the sex and began to speed up his thrusts, feeling that that moment of bliss was just almost within reach.<br />
<br />
A sudden rushing sensation surrounded the sperm halves of Megan and Jason and soon they found themselves being pushed up and back down the long tube and into the uterus they&#39;d come from not a few minutes prior--only this time surrounded by plenty of other sperm, many of which tried to swim for what it thought were the eggs they were seeking to fertilize, but only to fail by bouncing against a wall. Soon the eggs were in sight and the sperm sped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trish... try to warn me next time you want to do it at work... I&#39;ll come prepared with a condom,&quot; said Jules as he was beginning to recover from this round of sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we wanted to try?&quot; asked Trish, hugging him and keeping Jules close and still in her, knowing that reality was still malleable until he pulled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, sure... but maybe we wouldn&#39;t cause such a... mess that we&#39;ve got to clean up now,&quot; said Jules as he tried to pull out, only for Trish to hold on tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not our mess to clean up anymore, remember?&quot; asked Trish, knowing that her store uniform was now shifting to plain clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... stupid me, my head&#39;s still cloudy from sex,&quot; said Jules, who could feel himself starting to go soft, but he was still inside of Trish.<br />
<br />
Trish knew her time to shape reality was coming to an end, so she pushed for what she hope would set them up for a great future for their family, &quot;It&#39;s almost like you forgot you&#39;re an MD.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s still working his way up with loads of loan debt,&quot; said Jules.<br />
<br />
&quot;That your parents have already helped you with,&quot; said Trish<br />
<br />
&quot;Trish, not that I don&#39;t mind being close to you, but this position&#39;s kinda awkward to hold this long,&quot; said Jules.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew if I was pregnant,&quot; said Trish, and immediately she knew that the eggs had been fertilized, after which she let Jules pull out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then don&#39;t forget to pick up a test before we leave,&quot; said Jules as he stretched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in this store, remember, all pregnancy tests in this store make you not pregnant,&quot; said Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, reverse world department store... thank god I graduated when I did, it was hell worrying if you&#39;d end up pregnant or a baby day in and day out working here,&quot; said Jules</p>
