<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric saw that Kyle was calling him on his display. The hulk felt a pang of guilt and fear, almost overshadowed by his newfound masculine confidence. The jacket had belonged to Kyle, hadn&#39;t it? &quot;No,&quot; Eric whispered to himself, &quot;I took it, and it gave me this. It&#39;s mine. Mine!&quot; He picked up the phone. <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s voice sounded from the other end. &quot;Hey, bro, remember I was going to come by? I&#39;m on your street, think you could let me in?&quot; Crap. That&#39;s right, Kyle was coming over. And Eric was standing there, with his new musclegut partly out, the world&#39;s biggest junk on full display and said jacket dangerously close to bursting. &quot;Also, I&#39;m hearing some weird shit from the other guys, do you by any chance know where my jacket is?&quot; Oh, fuck. Who the fuck did Kyle think he was, huh? Eric felt his new manly assertiveness step in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here, pipsqueak, I-&quot; Eric stopped mid-sentence as the jacket finally gave in. As his bloated belly burst the rest of the buttons up front, his four foot wide shoulders tore the seams clean off, and simultaneously his thick upper arms ripped the seams along the arms. &quot;AAAHH!&quot; Eric saw the wisps of magic erupt from the torn seams, as the spells floated into the air of the living room, and he could see the light, swirling fog of golden light. He&#39;d dropped his phone on the floor, and he heard Kyle&#39;s faint voice: &quot;Eric? Eric! Fuck, I&#39;m comin-&quot;.<br />
<br />
Eric saw that the magic was moving towards him, and he felt the stretching in his muscles, as well as the pulse in his cock. He knew he couldn&#39;t stay in this room, so he lumbered towards the hallway, shutting the door to the living room, before falling to the floor as he felt a wave of growth come over him. He could clearly see his pecs swell slightly, his downwards vision shrinking slightly, and his gut, which was only just visible beneath, swelled outwards too. He felt his balls, his massive balls, churn and suddenly, his gargantuan cock came into view, its length pushed at an outwards angle, owing to his fat gut. He felt it churn and throb, and as Kyle burst through the front door, he saw a giant man with a giant penis and giant muscles sitting nude in the hallway, and roaring as he orgasmed, the spunk going at high-speed directly towards Kyle. Eric sat for a good minute, pumping out juice, before collapsing out of exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Kyle was standing in front of the door, covered in thick, white cum, as he watched the behemoth sag down, the massive cock still pulsing, squirting out smaller and smaller amounts of semen. He was truly speechless. Eric was a monster. The only way he knew that it was Eric, was because he&#39;d heard that the once skinny, short boy had changed - a LOT - over the last two days, and his jacket, which had given Kyle nearly 40 lbs of clean, lean muscle, had gone missing right before. Also, the deep, gravelly voice Kyle&#39;d heard over the phone just a minute ago was exactly like the roar that Eric had given when he&#39;d shot Kyle full with his babyjuice. Other than that, there was little to recognize.<br />
<br />
Eric looked to be almost as tall as Kyle now, and he had to be well over a hundred pounds heavier. The huge teen had a gut the size of a gym ball, a treasure trail trekking across and up to the the pecs, who each looked like half of a large watermelon, with a generous coating of fat, it looked. Eric&#39;s shoulders had to be over four feet across, and his arms were enormously thick. His face was covered in a short, scruffy beard, while his hair looked to have thinned slightly. And then there was his junk, consisting of the biggest appendage Kyle had ever seen, in porn or otherwise, supported by two testicles, each the size of a cantaloupe! They were wrestling for space against Eric&#39;s huge thighs, which were tree-trunk thick, and covered with a generous amount of hair. Was this what the jacket was doing? Would this have happened to Kyle, too, had he worn it any longer?<br />
<br />
First things first - he needed to make sure that Eric was okay. Kyle pulled off his sweater, which was covered in cum, and sat down by his friend, trying to ignore the still throbbing penis, and the huge belly. He lightly slapped the titan&#39;s cheek. &quot;Eric! Eric, can you hear me?&quot; Eric groaned in a Barry White-voice, his eyes opening slightly. &quot;Eric,&quot; Kyle pleaded, &quot;if you can hear me, blink twice.&quot; Eric blinked two times in short order. &quot;Okay, that&#39;s great, bro. Can you move? Can you stand up?&quot; The muscleman groaned as he sat upright, it clearly being quite the effort. <br />
<br />
Eric wasn&#39;t entirely clear-headed yet, but subconsciously he saw golden wisps of light streaking from him to Kyle. They were clearly invisible to Kyle, though, and Eric was more worried about trying to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go,&quot; Kyle said reassuringly. Eric was slowly standing up, his frame eclipsing that of Kyle. &quot;There, big guy.&quot; Kyle froze, before laughing quietly to himself. &quot;I guess I have to start calling you &quot;big guy&quot; now, huh?&quot; Eric didn&#39;t respond. Now that he was standing, his gut sagged slightly, and his meaty pecs rested on top of it. His giant cock hung at a slight angle from his crotch, the huge balls pushing it forwards. Eric was mumbling something, and it sounded a bit urgent. &quot;What was that?&quot; Kyle asked him. The jacket had to be the reason for this, surely, what did Eric know about it? Eric tried to enunciate. &quot;Out,&quot; he said, &quot;out of here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t understand. &quot;Dude, you can&#39;t go out like this, there are no clothes here for you to wear! I can&#39;t go out either, I&#39;m covered in your jizz!&quot; Was that mumbling a &quot;sorry&quot; from Eric? &quot;Look, do you mean go out into the garage? We can probably go there, if we&#39;re careful.&quot; Eric furrowed his eyebrows, a negative mumble, before he stopped: &quot;Yeah, pherhps.&quot; Great, Kyle thought. He began guiding Eric out of the door, towards the garage Eric&#39;s family had remodeled into a party lounge for Eric&#39;s older brother, who was currently in college. All the while, Eric started taking note of the golden wisps ceasing to flow from him, having disappeared into Kyle.<br />
<br />
As Kyle opened the door into the garage, it felt as though his t-shirt was a lot snugger around his torso. Probably because of the moisture from Eric&#39;s cum, he thought. Though his jeans also felt tighter, particularly in the rear. Eric collapsed onto the couch, while Kyle covered him with a blanket. Though it would make much of a difference, what with most of the expanse of flesh not being covered. &quot;I&#39;m going to go fetch some water,&quot; Kyle told Eric, who nodded - he was becoming more responsive. <br />
<br />
Eric squinted as Kyle headed out from the garage door. Those jeans looked a hella lot tighter, and was that shirt so tight? Meanwhile, Eric&#39;s own bulk looked slightly less monstrous, and he could see his cock clearly from above. What Eric didn&#39;t realize, was that while he&#39;d shut the magic from the jacket into their living room, he had been charged up with some of its magic, too. As he&#39;d made his way out into the hallway, he&#39;d been a storage of excess magic, it pumping him up to new levels of size. When he&#39;d orgasmed, he&#39;d released part of that magic, and that had all seeped into Kyle, taking some - but only a fraction - of Eric&#39;s size with it.<br />
<br />
That was why, as Kyle walked into the house, his clothes felt slightly more restrictive to his movement and comfort, his ass and thighs filling up his formerly straight jeans, which now looked to be skinny. Kyle had just filled up a bottle of water and picked up some fruit, when he saw his reflection in the kitchen mirror. He was bigger again. His biceps and triceps now filled the sleeves of the white t-shirt, while his pecs pushed out the chest, creating an overhang. He saw that his thighs were dramatically wider, and so were his shoulders, now straining the cotton fabric. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he whispered to himself. He also saw his jaw slightly wider and more square, a light dusting of scruff on his lower face. <br />
Kyle put down the supplies and turned in front of the mirror. His backside was bigger, too, creating a nice curve, while his back further enhanced the V-shape that he&#39;d begun having after the first time he&#39;d worn the jacket. He lifted up the front of his shirt, expecting to see a six-pack or maybe even an eight-pack, but the abs that he&#39;d gotten the last time hadn&#39;t gotten any more defined; while they looked bigger and more powerful, they were slightly less ripped. When he examined the other parts of himself, he saw the same thing! While he still was comparatively shredded, he was a bit less so than just this morning. But why was he growing anyway? Was the jacket near?</p>
