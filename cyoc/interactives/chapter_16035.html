<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My nose screamed for what it smelled, my tongue and taste buds had their input too, My mind was wild with passion, I wanted her and she longed for me.<br />
<br />
I maybe a second I was reared up, a ponies' cock strained outward hard and rigid, it was ready to make the plunge.<br />
<br />
Breathing was fast and in short breathes, I'd drag in a breath and snort out the feelings of sexual frenzy. <br />
<br />
Stepping toward her she lowered her head to the ground, tail held high and to one side, she was willing, welcoming, and ready.<br />
<br />
As I touched her firm hindquarters she seemed to shiver with expectation of what was to come. A half step forward had my shaft sensing the warmth of her sexual heat. It made of me a mad creature bent on having her as mine!<br />
<br />
It was the one second in my entire night when in a equine heated moment of passion that a rational thought surfaced in my mind. As the flared tip of my pony stallion shaft parted those moist and hot lips of equine sex there was a memory, a learned attitude, the knowledge of what I was doing was for me wrong.<br />
<br />
Stopping to think about what I was at that moment doing, the mare whinnied. Her call for me to continue was enough to erase any thinking thoughts. Down and in went my shaft following the hot tunnel. She gripped my male shaft making the sensation all the more thrilling and sensual.<br />
<br />
In and held by my lover's grip I began to move the big rump pulling on the shaft. Up, down, thrusting in and pulling back the shaft smoothed over the ribbed muscles of her vagina.<br />
<br />
The wild passion, my heart was bursting from feelings on lust and the sensual sensations. Like nothing I'd ever experienced before this mating was one to be remembered. Unlike in times past when mated and mating on or under my betrothed, this was more brutal. My massive organ was pressing deep into her massive body. Hairy belly rubbed over hairy rump. My tail swished with wild delights as her's moved back and forth slowly. Her coarse haired tail making my shaft quiver of the sensual feeling, driving me to lust for the whole endeavor all the more.<br />
<br />
Again I never felt the semen leave my body, that is until this time. It was like a clog and a flood coming down the length of my shaft. It shot out the opened end of my ponies' cock, spewing out both smooth cum liquids and what maybe was globs of semen too.<br />
<br />
In times past I'd have stayed burried deep, but with the sensation of my load shot there came an urge to dismount. Part of me begged to stay there and feel, feel, and lust for more. Another part of me was thinking of just how vaunerable to attack I was standing there humping and thrilled to death.<br />
<br />
The beastly instinct for self won the toss and stepping back I dragged a still half stiff cock from out her vagina.<br />
<br />
The mare whinnied, her head coming back up she turned to me and nibbled my flank. As if to pay me homage she began to lick my still hung shaft. As she worked from the sensual end and upward her think tongue cleaned and groomed my shaft.<br />
<br />
Her very touching soon had me erect as hell and thoughts returned to try my luck yet once more.<br />
<br />
We did do it again and another time after that till I was spent and felt satisfied so much we took to grazing, together.<br />
<br />
The sounds of birds announced the rising of a red morning's sun. I stood there my mouth filled with the green grass of her pasture. She whinnied at me softly, as if to beckon me to return to grazing in harmony with her.<br />
<br />
As the red rays of the sun touched my hairy hide I felt a draining of my massive equine strength. Indeed I was getting smaller or the mare was growing larger. Yet soon I lay on the pasture's green grasses, a man and his tatoo.<br />
<br />
There I stood naked, the light of day alerting me of something odd which had just occured. Quickly I searched the open pasture for my clothing finding my pants and shoes but a badly ripped shirt.<br />
<br />
A jump over the pasture fence had my lover standing there begging me to return. Looking around my wallet lay by the car's still opened door. A deep breath, a sigh, and I got into my car for that long remembered drive home.<br />
<br />
My thoughts returned to thinking of home, my duties to work, parents, country and God. It was as I stood before the bathroom mirror that those memories of a night filled with bestial sensations made me become erect, again.<br />
<br />
As my eyes looked close into the mirror seeing the tatoo of Fire upon my chest, my gaze dropped seeing a very erect penis.<br />
<br />
If anything could have forced back the memories, sensations, and all that I'd felt it was the erection which was happening. Like the night before I was painfully erect. Out straight, hard as hell, but what taunted my memories the most was the very real fact I'd lost my circumscission. The end of my penis was now flat except for a ring of flared flesh just an inch behind the tip. There on the end was a very slight dome, but as I felt about it was also thicker too.<br />
<br />
For some unknown reason I turned quickly and flicked out the light. The bathroom was windowless making the room black as night. I stood there remembering the mare and all that I'd done and felt. It made no sense why I a religious man would go out into a field and mate with some common animal. <br />
<br />
Standing embarressed of my actions I began to breath in and out in hard short breaths. My head ached and chest felt heavy. The more I felt a personal agony for the terrible things I remembered from the forenight, the stranger I felt all over.<br />
<br />
A room so black it was you could not see your hand before one's face. I tried and tried to reach and turn the knob making the bathroom lights to come on.<br />
<br />
It was as if my hands and fingers could not grasp the knob. Try after try they slipped off the knob till per chance it was struck just enough to bring up a dull yellowed glow.<br />
<br />
There looking back at me from the bathroom mirror was my pet and friend Fire. I eyed the reflection not making the connection, what I was looking at was indeed me!<br />
<br />
A screaming whinny did the trick and I for the first time saw this my other self. In a jump my forehoofs were on the bathroom sink. As my head touched the ceiling I eyed down into the mirror seeing for the first time a ponies' cock out in full blown erection.<br />
<br />
Memories of her, the mare and all I felt and liked from the night before flooded back. I began to hump as if burried deep in my mare. The erect cock swayed about touching my hairy round belly and giving me sensual thrills and a personal delight.<br />
<br />
Then it happened again, I came!<br />
<br />
A roaring sputtering of cum and semen shot out splattering the mirror, sick, countertop, and my forelegs.<br />
<br />
Standing there erect and thrilled the morning passed and it was mid afternoon before I calmed enought to try and exit the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Thick lips of workable muscle soon had the door opened and I pranced into the sun lighted bedroom.<br />
<br />
Ready to run outside and find that mare or anyother mare in need I wasn't to the bedroom's door before I collapsed onto the floor.</p>
