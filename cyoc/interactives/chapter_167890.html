<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...tied up in a cage made of thick wooden slabs, being carried by a group of bandits. The group was moving, farther and farther away, and with the slabs so close together, not a speck of light could get through. The group finally stopped, and the princess could hear the sounds of tents being put up. Finally, a hatch was opened, and the leering face of Kyrena gazed down on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my sweet princess, it looks like we&#39;re home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Home? Where are we? When my father finds out about this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father won&#39;t ever find you, brat. Our new camp is far, far away from your kingdom, so even if you do manage to escape, you wouldn&#39;t have the slightest idea where you were. And since we covered your cage, you won&#39;t be able to follow the route we took home either. It&#39;s time you accept that your life belongs to us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will you do with me? I&#39;m sure my father would pay a generous ransom for my return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyrena sighed. &quot;You&#39;re not listening. I have no intention of ever letting you go home. In fact, I had my men cover your carriage with animal blood. When your father finds it, he&#39;ll think a beast dragged you off and ate you for supper. Your death will be mourned throughout the land and he&#39;ll forget you ever existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna was horrified. &quot;My father...my father loves me. He&#39;ll find me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he won&#39;t. Your life is quite insignificant, princess, compared with the lives of his generals and advisors and all the people in the kingdom. He will forget you. So, now we have to decide what to do with you. I think the first step is an attitude adjustment. You&#39;re like a dog: you need to learn to obey before we can make use of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna bared her teeth. &quot;You will never break me, you filthy bandit. I&#39;ll defy you to my last breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyrena only smiled. &quot;We&#39;ll see how long your &quot;defiance&quot; lasts. Lock the cage! She doesn&#39;t eat until I say she does!&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna was left there, naked and scared, with only a bowl of brackish water to drink. She drank it greedily, and so in just a hour, it was gone. Her stomach rumbled. She shivered as cold winds blew across the cage. When she finally had to pee, the cage didn&#39;t have anywhere to drain, so her urine simply pooled around her. After fruitlessly knocking and screaming for more water for several minutes, she gave in and started drinking her urine, getting on her knees and lapping it up with her tongue. Coincidentally, this was when Kyrena popped back in. She laughed when she saw Arianna. <br />
<br />
&quot;You really are a dog! Here, have some meat!&quot;<br />
<br />
She threw a big raw piece of meat into the cage. Arianna picked it up with a look of disgust on her face. She&#39;d been taught that noble ladies only ate cooked meat. But then her stomach growled and she took a big bite out of the meat. Once her mouth tasted food again, she gave into her hunger and tore it apart, covering her face and hair with juice and chewing the meat only briefly before swallowing it.<br />
<br />
Kyrena smiled. &quot;Good girl. I think you&#39;re ready to be put to work. Drag her out, boys!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cage was flung open, and a gang of men grabbed Arianna and held her down. One of them took out a knife, cut all of her hair off, and then scraped it across her head until she was bald. Tears streamed down her face as her beautiful locks fell in piles around her.<br />
<br />
Kyrena walked up. &quot;Sorry, princess, but all that hair would just get in the way. Now, I think we&#39;ll get you started with menial work. Fetching water, washing clothes, cooking, whatever my men want you to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so it went for the next few months. Arianna, still naked, was forced to go around camp doing whatever hard labor was needed. She went down to the river with empty buckets and hauled them back one at a time. She carried heavy bundles of supplies. She washed clothes and mended them. She sharpened swords with a guard standing right behind her so she wouldn&#39;t try anything. She cooked delicious food for the bandits that she was never allowed to eat herself, settling for whatever scraps they fed her afterwards. And whenever someone wanted sex, Kyrena made it known that she was the camp whore. The bandits made her stroke their cocks while she did other jobs. They covered her food in semen. They purposefully avoided bathing and then made her suck their cocks so the smell would go right into her nose and stay there for days afterwards.<br />
<br />
But Arianna bore every hardship she had to endure, and as time passed, she changed. Her skinny body began to put on muscle, both from the hard labor and because she made sure to hide a portion of every meal she cooked before eating it once everyone else fell asleep. When the bandits tried to fuck her, she started getting defiant and attacked them, resulting in fights that left her with bruises and knife scars, but which made the men begin to grudgingly respect her. Eventually, they gave her a shirt, pants, and boots to wear. <br />
<br />
Arianna slowly eased her way into the gang. With her short hair, impressive muscles (by this point she was exercising specifically to build her body), and scarred, beaten face, she began to resemble one of them. She swore loudly, beat the men in arm wrestling, drank them under the table, and made them pleasure her when she wanted. Kyrena was all too pleased to see that the princess had completely shed her past life, and decided to see if she could be more useful.<br />
<br />
A merchant&#39;s caravan consisting of several small wagons escorted by a few armed men was crossing through the woods when arrows suddenly pierced the throat of the lead driver. Bandits emerged from the woods, pulled down the guards from their horses, and cut them to pieces. The merchants were forced out of their wagons and brought before a short-haired woman who towered over them. She flexed her arms to show off how they rippled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hand over all of your money before I rip your heads off.&quot; Most of the merchants did as they were told, but one refused to obey.<br />
<br />
Arianna smiled, revealing the same ugly yellow teeth that all the bandits had from eating and drinking too much. &quot;Not going to listen, eh? That&#39;s fine.&quot; She grabbed the man effortlessly with one arm and held him up before gesturing to a bandit to put a knife to his throat. She undressed him from the waist down with her other hand and started licking his penis until he was erect, then taking it into her mouth. After a few minutes of sucking him, she suddenly bit into his groin and as he screamed in pain, she tore his genitals clean from his body leaving a gaping wound. The merchants clutched each other in horror as they watched her chew the whole mess, popping the testicles between her teeth and holding the bloody head between her lips like a pacifier before swallowing it whole.<br />
<br />
She licked her lips. &quot;My favorite snack. Cut the rest of their cocks off and put them in a bag so I have something to eat on the way back.&quot; The bandits castrated their captives before leaving them to bleed to death, setting off with the wagons to pilfer them at their camp. One of them rushed ahead and told Kyrena of what had happened. She was both shocked and happy to hear his story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. She&#39;s one of us. Which makes her perfect for a little job I had in mind.&quot;</p>
