<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next few days, Leah and Eric had been unable to see each other at all. But Eric would be babysitting her once again this weekend, so they both were looking forward to it as Leah&#39;s mom would be working for the entire night shift this time, meaning that Eric would be staying over. However, durring the week leading up, something about Leah was rapidly and quite drastically changing. Her mother seemed to think of it as not a big deal, somehow lisa&#39;s script was actively ensuring that nothing would block Eric and Leah&#39;s love from progressing. So since her Mom didn&#39;t thinknit was of any real concern, she hadn&#39;t worried about it either. In fact, she was looking even more so to this weekend so that she could surprise Eric with her new self. <br />
<br />
And surprised he was indeed. When Eric arived at the house, Leah was the one who greeted him at the door. Eric had to be reassured numerous times that the person he saw was infact his beloved girlfriend and not her sister or something. This was because instead of his small, 11 yeah old girlfriend, a taller, way more developed version of her was now standing right in front of him. It looked like she had grown physically what she would have if they used their age gap as a benchmark, and in a week too. In other words, Leah was an 11 year old with the body of a 17 year old. <br />
<br />
What had convinced Eric that this gorgeous teenager was infact truly his girlfriend, was when she had turned around to lead him inside, and through her tight yoga pants, was her clearly defined, doughnut shaped asshole. The tight material of her pants had pressed up against it, and made it extremely well defined. Eric couldn&#39;t stop himself from getting a massive erection from the sight of it moving as his girlfriend&#39;s now more mature figure sexily swayed in front of him. <br />
<br />
It was then he noticed it. There was a small split in the fabric where part of it overlapped the other. It had been done very discreetly too. Curiosity got the better of him, and he reached and pulled up the flap with a finger, causing Leah to stop cold in her tracks. Eric wasn&#39;t expecting her to stop, and ended up nearly bumbing into her, however because of her stopping, his finger had gone right up her ass too, but not directly as the material of her yoga pants was still inbetween her asshole and his finger. Eric quickly trued to pull his finger out, but suddenly he felt a tight squeeze, clamp down on it, trapping it inside. &quot;Hmm Hmm Hmm, caught you now. I guess you will have to do whatever I want or I won&#39;t release this curious finger of yours.&quot; Leah taunted as she wiggled her butt. Try as he might, Eric was seriously stuck with his finger lodged knuckle deep into n her ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Leah, hold on a minute, I want to do this too, but your Mom is still here, let her leave at least&quot; whispered Eric.<br />
<br />
Leah smiles playfully back at him while looking over her shoulder. &quot;Nope, I am finding the idea of trying not to get caught to be much more fun. Plus I don&#39;t think I want to either. Consider it as punishment for touching without asking first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric paled a bit at her sudden threatening tone. He realized that he really had just done that, and quickly apologized. &quot;Hold on, why are you apologizing? I never said that I disliked it, nor that you were not allowed to do so, you know&quot; reassured Leah. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, then why am I being punished if you didn&#39;t mind it?&quot; Asked Eric, again in a whispered voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Mom said that some people like being punished by those they love.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the hell is you Mom thinking? Telling her 11 year old daughter something like that?&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean the same daughter that has been having a lot of anal sex with you and for a while now too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hahahaha, dont worry. Also, she found out about us already, and before you freak out, she said she is cool with it. She said that as long as I don&#39;t end up pregnant, she would allow us to date, and also do other things too. It&#39;s why we have the full night to ourselves after all. She just asked that we please clean up any mess we make is all&quot; explained Leah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on. She is ok with it? I mean, I am really happy that she is, but does it not seem odd to her?&quot;<br />
&quot;She said while it is not really socially acceptable, as long as we are not discovered, who cares if we date and such? This town has a whole lot of bigger issues to be concerned about. Mainly the big rat problem. Seriously, I wonder where they all come from? Mama rat has got to be enormous too. And actually, I do think they are kind of cute creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked at her curiously. &quot;You find the rats cute.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not all of them, oh but there was this huge pair of them really going at it right out in front of my school the other day. I think they were kinda cute. They were about the size of dogs even. Hey, why dont we try and catch those two and keep them as our pets?&quot; excitedly asks Leah.</p>
