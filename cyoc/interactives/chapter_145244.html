<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stark naked and unshakably pleased with himself, Si sauntered proudly down the street with his arms swinging. Any sense of doubt about his drastically changed body had been dashed longer ago than he could remember. The Simon that would have been mortified to be an hour late for school had been almost completely forgotten, lingering only in just enough of a nagging thought in the back of his mind that Si could smugly respond to himself “Fuck school. I’m going where I can pick up some more bitches.”<br />
A self-satisfied grin stuck on his face, he locked eyes with a passing driver as he stepped off the curb at a crosswalk. The car jerked suddenly as it’s driver stared, looking in disbelief up and down. Si gave a flex of his bicep back at the car as it veered off the road, loudly scraping the side of another parked vehicle. “That’s right,” Si said out loud. “Hung and hunky, grab an eyeful, bitch!” Without slowing down to question why he no longer could think anything without having to vocalize it, he turned and walked backwards, raising his arms to point down boastfully at his superhuman cock. The driver climbed out of their car, taking a few uneasy steps as they struggled to get a look at the fading, godly figure.<br />
Several minutes later, Si burst through the doors of the local mall. As Simon, he’d only ever visited the place on the rare occasion he wanted to buy a physical book at the bookstore or reserve an exclusive game. Luckily, his memory of the average patrons of this mall served his new caveman brain well—it was always full of fashion-obsessed, supermodel-imitating women. He ignored this type under normal circumstances, always having dreamed of marrying a famous physicist, but Si now faced an imperative he couldn’t ignore. He needed to be seen, he needed to be seen fucking, and he needed to be seen fucking the hottest women he could find.<br />
Heads from every corner in view of the front entrance turned. A nude, musclebound champion of a man with somewhere around a three foot erection had stepped through the automatic doors, and was marching straight through the middle of the mall with no shame. None of the shocked mallgoers could shame him, however. Each one was fixated intently on his perfectly chiseled face, his bulging arms, his immaculately defined abs, or his swaying bubble butt. The posted security guard, a well-built thirty-two year old woman, was the first one of the several that fell to their knees in instant orgasm. “Good girl,” Si said as he passed her. “You’d make a good conquest... maybe I’ll come back for you when I’m done with a blonde first,” he muttered, still talking to himself more than the whimpering heap.<br />
A quick scan of the area yielded just what Si was looking for. Tapping on her phone, a girl with platinum blonde hair stepped out of a nearby jewelry store. Her bright pink lipstick was what caught Si’s eye, but her figure was what clinched the decision. Round breasts thrust forward and curved ass pushed back. Just the prize to claim if he was to establish dominance in this territory.<br />
Si was in front of the girl in moments. Striking a wide-footed stance and throwing his arms behind his head in a flex, he jerked his cock upward, the tip of it flicking her phone from out of her face. Startled, she gasped, and Si grinned as he eyed the O shape her mouth made. Face frozen in surprise, her nostrils flared as Si’s manly pheromones hit her. She could swear it blew her hair back. Blinking, she looked the figure in front of her up and down. Si smiled to the others gathering at his side, he was attracting a growing crowd of admirers. However he quickly turned his attention back to his chosen target. “Hey babe,” He crooned in a voice even deeper than before. “You wouldn’t swipe me left, would you?”<br />
“Fuck!” The girl gasped to herself, taking a step back. She didn’t drop to the floor as some of the shoppers around her had, but it was clear she was fighting the urge to embrace him then and there. She continued to gasp for air, and nervously brushed a stray lock of hair out of her face. “God, no,” she eventually stuttered. “Are you like... one of those Abercrombie guys?” She wondered aloud, pointing weakly towards a nearby window display. The men in the posters paled in comparison to the vision of masculinity in front of them.<br />
Si didn’t hesitate, and took one of the girl’s perky breasts in his fist. Her knees wobbled, and she squealed.<br />
“What’s your name, sweet stuff?” Si purred, continuing to fondle her chest as he gently squeezed her cheeks with his other hand, forcing her mouth to hold that O shape. He towered over her at this point, just looking at her had been arousing him enough to trigger the effects of the pill, and his body was slowly growing again.<br />
“Myyy tiittiiiiieeeees,” was all she whined through her pinched lips. “He’s playing with myyy tiiiiiiiiittiiiiiieeeeeeeees!”<br />
Si laughed. “I’m Si, and I’m gonna fuck you,” he grunted. He took his fuckstick in hand, about to line it up to the girl’s pussy, when he spotted another flash of pink. “Si!! Oh Si thank you!!!” The first girl moaned loudly as he continued to stare over her. “My titties! Thank you just for playing with my tiiitiiieees!!!” She finally dropped to her knees, one hand thrust into her panties. “Stay there,” Si muttered and set off into the crowd. Another blonde, dolled up even more than the last, had emerged from the food court with a pair of bright pink sunglasses sitting on her crown. Sipping a smoothie, she looked at her watch impatiently. She had several rings on, and one look at her figure told Si she’d had extensive work done.<br />
Si roughly pushed the staring crowd aside, walking straight up to the bombshell. “God fucking damn,” he slurred, looking her up and down. She noticed him and dropped her cup.<br />
By now Si’s arousal had spun out of control. He lacked the brain power to spin a charismatic pick up line, and settled for grabbing the woman’s arm. “You, and me... now,” he commanded. The woman smiled and immediately stepped forward “Wow,” she giggled. “Fuck, you’re strong... I’ve never seen... someone as fucking gorgeous...”<br />
Si’s angelic jawline pushed out even further, and his mountainous pecs swelled. “Fuck yeah,” he grunted. “Be honored.”<br />
The woman fell forward, her mouth sliding effortlessly over the tip of Si’s cock. He caught her in his large hands, and had barely begun relishing the blowjob before a loud voice shattered the moment. “What the fuck?!! What is this!?!”<br />
A burly, dark-haired man had worked his way through the crowd of admirers and stood nearby, his arms held in a furious fighting pose. “Motherfucker, that’s my wife!!!” He spat. Si turned to face him, lip curled indignantly at this annoyance. He looked the man over and recognized him instantly. This new brain didn’t remember much of Simon’s life, but it did remember Bill Lewis, the owner of the movie theatre near Simon’s house. Bill had messed with Simon since he witnessed Bill buying drugs behind the theatre. From then on, Bill had threatened Simon into keeping his mouth shut whenever they saw each other in the neighborhood.<br />
“Fuck off,” Si drooled, and put his hand on the back of the woman’s head. He started thrusting his hips, making her gag and bubble. She clearly offered no resistance.<br />
The man leapt forward with a wild roar, and began grappling at Si’s titanic arm. Unsurprisingly, he had little effect. Si threw his arm to the side, and sent Bill sailing over the crowd. Si stood and watched for a moment as Bill crashed through the window of a nearby store, crumpled in a heap in a pile of clothes, laid there for a moment, and began to struggle to his feet again. “This asshole doesn’t know who he’s fucking with,” Si grumbled. He lifted his partner under one arm, and turned to walk back in the other direction.<br />
Where Si had left her, the girl Si had picked first was fondly stroking her own chest, basking in the memory of his touch. Her face lit up as she spotted Si making his way back through the throng of shoppers, and jumped to her feet, waving. “Si! Si, over here, please! Please, god, I’m here! I’m yours!! Touch me again with your perfect hands!!!”<br />
Her wish was quickly granted as Si scooped her up with his free hand. Once more, he turned around, just in time for Bill to limp back into view. Fists at the ready, he was undeterred by being sent through a window.<br />
Si was smiling. His proud manhood stood tall before him at around four feet by now, longer and wider than Bill’s strongly built torso. He set the two women down beside him, and without breaking eye contact with Bill, proclaimed “Strip, bitches.”<br />
The two immediately began tearing their clothes off. “Brittany!! Get the fuck over here!!!” Bill hissed at his wife. Even in his fight ready pose, he was starting to look shaken. He found it difficult to take his eyes off Si’s cock. It was like it was staring at him.<br />
Si waited for the girls to strip completely bare. His hands at the ready, fingers wiggling, the last panties fell away, and he gripped them by the waist. Bill’s frown melted into a gape as the giant proceeded to lift the two women, press them against his cock, and thrust between them. Si was likely eight feet tall after so long in arousal, and with the added muscle likely six feet wide. The brightly flushed cock sandwiched between the girls was spitting a ludicrous amount of precum, and it made a loud, wet slurp as it squelched between the bodies with increasing speed.<br />
Bill’s eyes bulged at the sight. Absently feeling at his crotch, it dawned on him with a growing horror that he’d sprouted a furious stiffy, and even worse, that it wasn’t at his nude wife or the girl next to her, but at the godly man using them as a cocksleeve. <br />
Si licked his lips in abandon as he worked the two girls into a blur over his cock. Their rhythmic whimpers slowly blended into a constant cry of ecstasy that went on as he rumbled. “Think you’ll ever be as much man as this?”<br />
Bill unzipped his pants with shaking hands, he was sweating profusely. He muttered in a small voice to himself, his head bowed but his eyes fixed on Si’s cock. “SPEAK UP, NANCY!” Si shouted. His voice shook the windowpanes. <br />
“I’ll never... be as much... man as you!” Bill sobbed. Double fisted on his cock, he sunk to his knees.<br />
“Not even in a hundred years, old man!” Si laughed. The soaked girls in his grip attempted to sling desperate to his cock. “I mean, how long do you think it took me to get this bod?”<br />
“Oh god.... you’re amazing... must be twenty, thirty years of lifting, working... sweating...” Bill panted. He was almost matching Si’s speed as he pummeled himself. “God! Your body... I’m... gonna!...”<br />
Just like a football, Bill went flying as Si gave him a good punt. Bill landed with a splash in the mall fountain as Si roared. “I’M NOT EVEN DONE WITH TWELFTH GRADE, FAGGOT!!! I’M FUCKIN’ GODLIKE AND IM SEVEN-FUCKIN’-TEEN!!!!!”<br />
Si fell on his ass with a heavy thud as he came. Cracks spread across the tiled floor, as the roof of the two-story mall was punched by a supersonic jet of white. “SO... FUCKIN’... AWE.... SOME... BEING... HUGE!!!!” He screamed with each successive launch. He eventually fell to incoherent bellowing as he continued to cum. The exhausted girls slowly slumped to the base of Si’s dramatically throbbing cock, devoting the last of their energy to kissing and stroking it. After several minutes, Si’s output eventually ebbed to a gentle pumping. Those who hadn’t fled the falling debris were bathing in or hungrily slurping at the puddle growing from around Si’s reclining body.<br />
“Either if you ladies got a pen? I’ll wanna party with you again,” Si mustered. “I got some friends from school you should meet....”<br />
As he came slowly back to his senses, the first thing Si could think of was how good he looked. He smirked down at himself, admiring how big he’d gotten, and flexed his arms, bounced his pecs, and rippled his abs for his own amusement. He couldn’t imagine what else this unparalleled body could be capable of.</p>
