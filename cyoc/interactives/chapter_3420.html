<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean decided that the first targets of his new &quot;toy&quot; would be his roommates, he had never liked them because they were always picking on them, and he had been planning on moving out. But now thought of a new way to take care of the problem. He started programming in the stats for Jay and Dan and most of the elements filled themselves in when he typed their names. He first programmed some changes in for Dan, programming in the stats for a 4 year old male black lab. He decided not to affect his mind till after Dan realized what had happened. Next, he set up some changes in the portable emmitter for Jay. While he made dan his &quot;best friend&quot; he would use the 10 changes in the emmitter to slowly make Jay his dream girlfriend. He finished up and pocketed the transmitter. Then he waited. A few minutes later, Jay and Dan walked in, carrying a few bags from the mall. Jay shouted to sean, &quot;Hey dipshit, I'm gonna use that computer as soon as I get done with my shower, so hurry up.&quot; Dan laughed a bit and went over to the couch. As soon as Jay got in the shower, Sean hit the transform button on the computer screen. Having set the change for 30 seconds, Dan instantly noticed something wrong. He quickly got smaller and black fur sprouted from his body. As quickly as he noticed it happen, he was completely a dog. He let out a short yelp and looked over at the laughing Sean. He barked once, and Sean said, &quot;Yep, I did this to you, but you wont know that in a second.&quot; Sean pushed the second change in for Dan changing his mental self into that of a trained 4 year old black lab who loves and protects his master. He told Dan to go to his room and be quiet, and the dog scampered off. He shutdown the computer program and smiled as he heard Jay turn off the shower. He sat on the recliner as jay came out of the bathroom wearing only a towel. He started to head to his bedroom when Sean hit the first button on the transmitter. Jay stopped and said, &quot;Ow, what the fuck was that Sean?&quot; Jay turned and advanced at  Sean. Sean merely said, &quot;Dont take another step.&quot; Jay suddenly stopped, though he obviously didnt want to. He said, &quot;What the fuck did you do, you little prick?&quot; Sean smirked and answered, &quot;I just made you a bit more open to suggestion...&quot; Jay looked confused, so Sean took advantage and hit the second button. Jay rubbed the spot where the invisible beam hit him, and said, &quot;What is that thing, what did you just do?&quot; Sean smiled and said, &quot;Drop your towel.&quot; Jay dropped it and said, &quot;What are you, some kind of perv?&quot; Sean shook his head and said, &quot;Look down.&quot; Jay looked down in time to see his penis shrink down to nothing but smooth skin. Jay said, &quot;Oh my god, how the fuck did you do that? Put it back or I'll kick your ass.&quot; Sean simply pushed the third button, shrinking Jay from a tall 6' 2&quot; to a more average 5' 5&quot;. Jay noticed that the room seemed a bit bigger, as well as Sean. He tried to leap at Sean, but was unable to move his feet. Sean stood up and said, &quot;Now you are two inches shorter than me, but that's not all.&quot; And he pushed the fourth button. Jay's hair turned from black to blonde and grew down to waist level, covering his face. Jay, unable to defend himself, started crying, he called out for Dan to help. Sean said, &quot;Dan cant help you, it feels bad to be picked on when you cant stop it.&quot; and he pushed the fifth button. Jay began to feel pressure in his chest, and two mounds carefully pushed their way out. They continued to grow and grow, finally stopping at a gigantic F-cup. Jay looked at them, and reached out to see if it was real. He touched his nipple and instantly jerked his hand back as a jolt of pleasure ran through him. At this point, he looked rather freakish, A man's body with long silky blonde hair, a pair of gigantic tits covered with chest hair, and a crotch with testicles but no penis. Sean laughed at what he saw, and said, &quot;I should leave you like this... you dont even have a way to piss...&quot; Jay looked at him and said, &quot;PLEASE, NO! I'LL DO ANYTHING.&quot; Sean nodded and said, &quot;You're right, I'm not that mean.&quot; And Sean pushed the 6th button. Jays testicles disappeared, leaving nothing in his crotch but a patch of pubic hair. Jay resumed crying and Sean pushed the 7th button. All of Jay's body hair disappeared, leaving him with perfectly smooth skin. Jay hesitantly said, &quot;What now? C'mon man, you've had your fun.&quot; Sean shook his head and pushed button number 8. Jay doubled over in pain as his body and muscles restructured. His build became that of a well toned, but petite, woman. Sean laughed and said, &quot;Here it comes, your last step towards womanhood, at least physically.&quot; He pushed the 9th button and a popping sound came from Jay's crotch. Jay felt excruciating pain as his insides rearranged from male reproduction to female reproduction. Then, he started to grow female pubes as a hole started to form in his crotch. A few seconds later he had a full compliment of female organs. Jay said in a fit of rage. &quot;NO! PUT ME BACK NOW YOU LITTLE CUNT!&quot; Sean looked back at him and calmly said, &quot;I think you are more of a cunt now.&quot; Sean pushed the last button. Jay, who didnt notice any change, said, &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; But as soon as he finished his question, he got a craving to have sex with any man he could find. He stop himself from thinking about it just long enough to say, &quot;You perverted asshole, you made me a horny slut.&quot; Sean laughed and said, &quot;Yeah, but I could have done alot worse. Here Dan.&quot; Jay watched as a black lab came out of Dans room and licked at Sean's hand. Jay was horrified, but Dan had really had less suffering than Jay had, and would live a happier life. Sean said, &quot;Now, I want you to act like a teenage girl name Joanne who is head over heels in love with me in every way. But always remember who you really are. Oh, and dont tell anyone what I did to you. And if you try to communicate what happened in any way, then stop, come home as soon as possible, and tell me what you did so I can think of a good punishment.&quot; Joanne fumed inwardly but couldnt help but giggle and say, &quot;Why would I do that, honeykins?&quot; Sean smirked and said, &quot;I know you are still in there, Jay, hah, I'm gonna bang you any you're gonna like it.&quot; Joanne said, &quot;Ooh, bang me baby. Wait, who's Jay?&quot; Jay was trapped inside this woman's body, forced to act like she loved the one who did it to her. His mind cried as he started sucking on Sean's cock while Sean massaged his huge tits. And he realized, he did like it... Sean remembered to do one thing before he took Joanne to his room. He pushed save on the transmitter. Both at Jay and at Dan. They were his now. Jay began inwardly plotting at how to get revenge on Sean without breaking his orders.</p>
