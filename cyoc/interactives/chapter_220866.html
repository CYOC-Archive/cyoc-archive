<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish that Ricky would age ten years in an hour.&quot; The warmth he felt emanate from the ring told him that his wish worked. As much as Bobby wanted to grant Ricky&#39;s wish as fast as possible, he felt that it might put him into shock or something. So a slower age up probably was for the best. Ten years, huh? That would put Ricky at 23, two years older than his current age. That was going to be interesting. Well, nothing to do but to kill time until something interesting happens.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ricky was deciding what to do now. He didn&#39;t want to play more of his game today as he was too frustrated and he didn&#39;t want anything to do with &quot;Eric&quot;. He ended up deciding to just surf the internet for now. Ricky mostly browsed the forms and social media. One of the posts he saw was that of a gaming influencer who worked out a lot. This time that influencer posted a post-workout selfie. His muscles were bulging with the caption saying how proud he was of his hard work. Man, if only he had a body like that, Ricky thought. If only...<br />
<br />
It was about 15 minutes later and Ricky was feeling a bit flushed. Was it always this warm? Maybe some water or some ice cream was in order. However, when Ricky stood up, he felt disoriented for some reason. Everything in his room looked different. The young teen was unaware that he had just aged two years and shot up 4 inches. Was he getting sick he thought? Maybe he should take a nap. Ricky quickly shut off the blaring metal music he was listening to and flopped onto his bed.<br />
<br />
The music suddenly turning off alerted Bobby that something was up. Looking at the clock 15 minutes had passed. If Ricky was going to age up 10 years in an hour, he would age a year every six minutes. That would mean he would be fifteen and one-half years old now.<br />
<br />
&quot;15 1/2 huh? He must have changed a lot by now... Maybe just a quick peak?&quot; It seems like Bobby could not contain his curiosity, so he quietly snuck up to Ricky&#39;s bedroom and cautiously opened the door. There Bobby&#39;s eyes widen at what he saw. No longer was there a short and skinny boy, but a tall teen asleep on his bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, looking good already, huh Ricky? You wouldn&#39;t mind if I see you age another year?&quot; Bobby whispered to himself. Not that Ricky could hear him of course. Bobby picked a good time to observe however as Ricky was about to undergo another growth spurt. His height had shot up another 4 inches, making Ricky an even 6 feet. It was hard to see with his baggy clothes, but Ricky&#39;s muscles were also starting to bulk up. Was he getting more serious about sports or something? One thing that was easy to see was his face though as it matured. If Bobby had to describe it, it was something like a handsome, punkish, brooding, bad-boy look, or something like that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, Ricky. Puberty sure was kind to you. Can&#39;t wait to see you when you wake up.&quot; As much as Bobby wanted to stay he didn&#39;t want to be here when Ricky eventually woke up. He still thought he was &quot;Eric&quot; after all and he probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate &quot;Eric&quot; spying on him. Plus he didn&#39;t want to stand around here for another 30 minutes. So, Bobby snuck away from Ricky&#39;s room and went back to preparing dinner.<br />
<br />
When Ricky reached age 18, he had one final growth spurt and reached a final height of 6&#39;4. A full foot taller than he started as! His baggy shirt now looked like a crop top, allowing his abs and arms to be on display. The now young man might be done growing taller but he wasn&#39;t done growing more muscular. Seems like college didn&#39;t stop him from going to the gym. In fact, maybe it seemed like he went more frequently. The former baggy clothes Ricky had on were struggling to contain the new muscular man.<br />
<br />
30 minutes had passed since Ricky fell asleep leaving him at age 21. It was at this time that the now young man started to stir in his sleep. He just couldn&#39;t get comfortable. One minute he would find a good position but then it would suddenly become uncomfortable. So he would take a new position and the cycle continued, as he was unaware of his changing body. Ricky was also having weird dreams. It started out normal with him dreaming of having fun with Bobby but then suddenly they were adults and Bobby kissed him in the dream.<br />
<br />
These two factors were the reasons why Ricky awoke at age 21 with 15 minutes left in his aging.</p>
