<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The music was starting to die down as it was almost three in the morning and the party was on it’s last legs. <br />
<br />
Most people had either stumbled home, most of whom lived in one of the nearby houses or elsewhere on campus or were passed out drunk in those houses or in the back yard.<br />
<br />
“It’s time to go to bed.” Said Terry with a yawn as he stood up.<br />
<br />
“Come on I want to watch the sunrise.” Said his girlfriend, Erica as she fought to keep her blue eyes open as a mixture of too much to drink and the hour was having it tole. <br />
<br />
“Your falling asleep where you sit.” Countered Terry as Erica thought for a moment before nodding her head and standing up, her shoulder length blonde hair held back in a ponytail.<br />
<br />
“Bed it is.” Said Erica putting down the bottle of water she had been drinking for a while when she called it quits on the beer. <br />
<br />
“Come on, I’ll walk you back to your room.” Said Terry, it wasn’t far. Erica was in the sorority who’s house backed up onto the frat he was a member in.<br />
<br />
“Or we can have some fun?” offered Erica as she pulled out a small bag of mushrooms. “Jenny said these make things interesting in the bedroom.”<br />
<br />
You knew you shouldn’t, it was possibly the worse idea in your life. But when your blonde bombshell of a girlfriend wanted to try new things in the bedroom you couldn’t say no.<br />
<br />
“Sure, why the fuck not.” Answered Terry as he took a single mushroom as did Erica. Nothing seamed to happen but you two didn’t want it to kick in while standing by the pool in the backyard.<br />
<br />
Stepping over some passed out people you two headed toward Terry’s room. <br />
<br />
“There goes the blonde power couple.” Said a woman neither of them knew, she looked very hot but with lime green hair she seamed odd. She was also wearing Nick’s clothing which looked way too big on her. <br />
<br />
“Nick must of gotten lucky.” Said Terry, it was odd though. Blonde Power Couple was Nick’s not so well thought of nickname for Terry and Erica because both of them had golden blonde hair and with Erica having blue eyes while Terry had green.<br />
<br />
“Come on, lets get lucky ourselves.” Countered Erica as she pulled her boyfriend up the stairs. Neither of them realizing that the women in Nick’s cloths was a transforming Nick.<br />
<br />
In their state they walked past a man sleeping on the couch only now instead of a pair of legs a long merman tail came out from his hips.<br />
<br />
Once in Terry’s room, Erica shut the door and pulled off her top. Showing off her C cup breasts contained in a pink bra.<br />
<br />
“Come on big boy.” ordered Erica wondering when those mushrooms would kick in. Then they did.<br />
<br />
It was the closest thing to an acid trip either of them had ever tried, as the two of them began to have sex in Terry’s bedroom. Everything seamed alive, the lights coming from outside the window seamed to be alive and they could feel everything. Both of them began what they thought was a kind of out of body experience, not realizing what was happening wasn’t in their heads but very real.<br />
<br />
Erica was moaning Terry’s name as he kissed her now shrinking breasts as she grew. Her shoulders broaden as muscles began to be added in all the wrong places for a woman but all the right places if she was a man.<br />
<br />
And that was what she was becoming.<br />
<br />
The mermaid virus, transformed about 50% of men into mermaids but a much smaller percentage of women became man and therefor merman. Erica was falling into this group as her frame changed into something much more manly. Her long blonde locks falling away even as Terry was within her, new shorter blonde hair replaced it as her jawline became much more defined. <br />
<br />
Terry thought it was the mushrooms which made him think he was fucking a male version of his girlfriend. He looked down to see a large pair of breasts were growing out of his chest, much larger then his own girlfriends being closer to D cups then Erica’s B. That is when his brain concluded that the mushrooms was making him think he was a woman and Erica was a man. <br />
<br />
They kept going like rabbits as Terry’s frame shrank and his face soften, his short blonde hair became long. His long blonde hair falling down in curls just like his mother’s while his ass became something to die for in its own right. <br />
<br />
If someone had been watching from the outside, they would have seen a rather good-looking blonde man fucking an equally as good look blonde hair women. The only problem was each had the wrong private parts.<br />
<br />
Then that changed as well.<br />
<br />
Terry let out a load breathless moan as he became a woman and at almost the same moment, Erica became a man and stuck her seconds new dick into his second old womanhood.<br />
<br />
Both of them, not fully realizing what was going on kept going. Thinking it was a mixture of the mushrooms, the alcoholic and the lateness of the hour didn’t consider what was happening was real. Finally with one last moan, Erica shot a load into her now women boyfriend. <br />
<br />
“That was amazing.” Said Terry in a new female voice, sleep fast approaching.<br />
<br />
The mermaid virus had turned Terry into a woman while Erica had become a man, at the moment that was the limit of their changes but it was only a matter of time until more changed.<br />
<br />
The last thing both of them remember was the sound of police sirens and someone calling for help.</p>
