<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to test out the voodoo doll on each of your little brother&#39;s friends tonight. It would help knock him down a few pegs to have his best friends all outgrow him. After asking the three little toddlers if they would like to see the doll&#39;s magic. They each shook their heads enthusiastic, as their smiles brimmed. Watching them each ruffle their hair for loose pieces, they hand you a single strand as you clasp them in your palm. Looking over at your little brother, he was obviously dejected. His arms were crossed, as his face scowled with disapproval over his friends cooperation in your so-called magic. Little did he know, he was in for a big surprise.<br />
<br />
Taking the three strands of hair: gold, brown, and orange. You try to stick them on the head of the voodoo doll. To your surprise, they each snapped on like magnets, standing firm and prominent despite gravity. You think for a moment, and remembered the magical words. You then utter &quot;annos progressum transformatio&quot;. At once the boys&#39; bodies started to tremble. Small groans escaped their lips as their bodies began to rise taller.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-we&#39;re getting bigger!&quot; Moaned Johnny. After closing his eyes briefy, passing another growth spurt, he opened them with a gasp. &quot;No... we&#39;re getting OLDER!&quot; He corrected himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My head feels funny&quot; Ryan groaned as he held his head with two hands.<br />
<br />
Alan only looked silently at your little brother who stood by his side. You watched your little brother&#39;s face gap wider in horror as the once tiny Alan grew taller before him.<br />
<br />
The boys&#39; hair also became more shaggy with age. Johnny&#39;s faux hawk extended longer into a messy pompadour, while Alan&#39;s curly hair was covering his eyes now. Ryan&#39;s wavy orange hair was starting to darken, with a slight red hue becoming ever more prominent.<br />
<br />
Watching their little toddler clothes begin to constrict their growing bodies, their shirts rising well above their bellybuttons. You decide this would be a good stopping point as you say &quot;processus claudum&quot;.<br />
<br />
The boys&#39; bodies all froze with a snap, as they all let out a final gasp in unison. Looking over at their own larger body with wide eyes before each other&#39;s. They stared back at you with bewilderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God...&quot; Ryan mutter, &quot;we just grew up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it... It feels so strange... Like I don&#39;t even think like a 5-year old anymore... I feel like I&#39;m actually 11 now!&quot; Johnny followed.<br />
<br />
Alan nodded his head in agreement, he couldn&#39;t help but notice he was still the shortest amongst his grown friends.<br />
<br />
Noticing the change in their demeanors, you concluded that the doll did not only change their physical age, but rather their mental age as well. Looking over at the boys&#39; new bodies, you couldn&#39;t help but notice the slightly puffy bulge pushing off of Ryan&#39;s underwear. Ryan also began to notice the growth in his boyhood as he poked it slightly with a gaping mouth. The other two boys were also undergoing similar transformations with their bodies, but at a lesser degree. Their dicks can be seen poking against the tight fabric strapped on to their crotches. Clearly budding for future prospects. The boys scratched their groins unknownly as a result.<br />
<br />
Suddenly loud stomping gathered everyone&#39;s attention as they shifted their heads to the origin of the clamor. What they found was an last remaining toddler, kicking up a tantrum. &quot;Turn them back! Turn them back!&quot; He yelled, his face becoming red.<br />
<br />
Hearing his demands, his friends glanced between each other with an uneasy expression. Your little brother who once stood tall amongst his band of mischiefs, now could only face their bellies.<br />
<br />
You smile, giving the choice of returning back into toddlers or growing even older. Without a second thought, the boys all shouted back &quot;I want to grow up more!&quot; The boys brimmed with excitement as they gathered before you.<br />
<br />
Your brother realizing his defeat, collapse to the ground desolated. Betrayed by the ones he thought closest with. The boys tried briefly to comfort their fallen friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we can play some other night.&quot; Johnny suggest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about sharing your toys too.&quot; Ryan chimed in.<br />
<br />
Alan nodded as he padded your little brother&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, the boys return to you with wide smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Are you going to make us grow or what?&quot; Johnny smirk.<br />
<br />
Seeing that their clothes were on the verge of tearing, you suggest that they all head upstairs to change into something a little more suitable first. With that you usher the three giddy adolescent up the staircase, while leaving your toddler aged brother alone downstairs.<br />
<br />
After sending the boys into your room to change their clothes, you wait patiently for them to return. The door opened as a familiar blonde boy walked out. He was wearing one of your favorite t-shirts and black jeans. The t-shirt reached down to his knees while the jeans seemed a little loose on him. Looking at his face, he had a noticeable peach fuzz on his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peach fuzz?&quot; He asked himself. &quot;It means ... I&#39;m going to need to shave soon, I hope it&#39;s as cool as it looks in commercials.&quot; <br />
<br />
Johnny then moved aside as Ryan made his appearance. Unlike Johnny, he dressed himself quite plainly. Wearing a wifebeater over his torso, and some running shorts against his waist, he seemed contempt by wearing something loose now.<br />
<br />
Lastly Alan stepped out with only a shirt hung over his body. His scrawny legs poked out from he knees and under. Unlike Johnny or Ryan, he hadn&#39;t any sign of peach fuzz on his face.<br />
<br />
With that you lead the boys to your parents&#39; bedroom. The final destination to complete their transformation...</p>
