<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was now an ass. A smelly, filthy ass, and there was nothing she could do about it. The worst part was how good she felt. How right the fat belly felt on her. Her tail squirming against her butt cheeks sent shivers up her back, and she started straining her butt. The tail started spasming as it jerked against the vagina. A part of her hated the tail, one of the biggest symbols of the animal she was now , but that part was getting weaker all the time, almost instantly she thought of how many jacks it would attract, or how good it would be at keeping the flies away on a hot summer day.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was still on the donkey’s big stables and fields of Pleasure Island, where all transformed boys and girls had to wait for the moment to be bought. Jennifer walked slowly into her stall, and collapsed on the hay with a weak bray, not even bothering to deal with her panties’s remnants on her rump, she was too depressed. She got comfy in the safety of her stall and cried herself to sleep, not even caring about the upcoming donkey dream she knew was to come.<br />
<br />
Jennifer moved along the field, grazing placidly. There was something simple to the act of grazing. You simply put one hoof in front of the other and let your lips grab at the grass. Grass was also one of the pluses of being a jenny. It was everywhere, so if she wanted to eat all she needed to do was lean down and take a mouthful. Being an animal was wonderful, it was simple. All she had to do was fill her fat belly to her heart’s content and breed when wanted. <br />
<br />
Jennifer snorted the hay away from her muzzle as she slowly woke in the morning, last night still weighing heavily on her. She honestly wanted to just roll over and go back to sleep, hoping this whole experience was some kind of horrible nightmare. <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t get comfortable though, her panties tears was like a corset around her butt and was cutting into her waist as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
She didn’t even really know where she was going. Her brain was a confused mess, caught between two worlds. All she could do was clop around the barn, her heavy hoof beats against the concrete echoing and reminding her that she was an ass.<br />
<br />
Getting back onto all fours, Jennifer began grazing, her muzzle aiding in the effort greatly as she nipped grass with her larger teeth and lips. The grass was delicious, her lips expertly grabbing at each blade and holding it for asecond while the big flat slabs of her teeth grabbed those blades and ground them up. Therising sun was warm on her back as it rose.As she came up for air, her tail twitched against her binding. <br />
<br />
The most annoying thing now was the remains of her panties squeezing her relentlessly, the only reminder of her humanity. <br />
<br />
She suddenly felt her tail being cut into, and then there was a loud snap. All at once the pressure was gone.The bindings that had contained her tail had finally failed , the rest of her panties fell to the ground. The full length appendage apily swaying behind her as she gave a happy bray at the relief from the pressure. She saw a massive equine ass behind her, and could just see the bulge of the tail over the top of the rump.<br />
<br />
She could feel it more than anything, now swishing back and forth over furry butt cheeks. Jennifer sighed as she realized she was now a full donkey as far as she could tell, nolonger the young woman she had been only a few weeks ago. This depressing thoughts ruiningher appetite as she ambled into her stall.<br />
<br />
The sound of her heavy hoof beats on the concrete reminded her of just how much weight she had put on. She bent her long neckdown to look at the belly hanging under her. “So fat...” she thought. <br />
<br />
“Aye..that’s what ya get for eating grass all day” a voice sounded from behind her.<br />
<br />
“Heee-haww!” She let out a bray of surprise and kicked her rear legs. Embarassing...what an animalistic way to react to someone behind you. She thought. If sh ecould have blushed she would have. She looked over her shoulder and saw a beautiful black-haired woman, she should be the owner of Pleasure Island. <br />
<br />
“I would like to ask your name, but it&#39;s pretty obvious that you only can bray” the owner said as she looked her equine body, inspecting the curse work. “Hmmm...I must say the curse outdid itself with you dear.” <br />
<br />
Her eyes roamed over every inch of her body. “Perfectly formed ears...” She grabbed one gently and rubbed it. “A nice fat belly.” She patted Jennifer’s belly, then looked under her. “Fully functional udders. I could say that you were a natural born jennet!”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, I decided to stay with me. I&#39;ll takecare of you, good feed and board will be the pay for your work.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer was terrified.  <br />
<br />
“Now you have human mind. But you’re a donkey, so your mind should match, you’ll be happier that way, it does no good for you to be longing for something you’ll never be again.” the owner said letting go of her mouth.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared at her for a long time, her blue eyes looking very out of place on her assine muzzle. “How am I going to be happier being a smelly animal.” Jennifer asked. She had to admit she felt good. It was an odd feeling, all the alien parts she now owned. The tail swishing over her rump. A rump any jack would love to have. Her heavy ears, swaying this way and that. Her strong back, able to pull anyload.<br />
<br />
“Cause you won&#39;t know your a smelly animal, youll just be a regular dumb donkey” the owner smiled looking into her eyes. “I can already see a little of the donkey brain in you, I’m sure you&#39;ve noticed it.“ <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAWW! HEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAWW!&quot; Jennifer brayed.<br />
<br />
“See lass, it&#39;s already happening whether you like it or not, let me do you a kindness and make it quick. I’ll make you a donkey genius, you will remember being human and your human memories, you’ll be able to understand speech, and open latches, things like that. Make your time with me better for the both of us.” The owner said rubbing her head and scratching right behind her ears.<br />
<br />
““Donkey..feel like...donkey...” Jennifer thought. “Want to eat...waaaaa-hawwwww to sleep. Heeeee hawwww! Waaawwwww heeeeee to mate.” Jennifer’s mind was exhausted, ready to give up the long fight and accept the soothing feeling of dullness on the edge of her brain.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s right lass, I&#39;ll take care of you now. Before I give you my gift, what was your name?” the owner touching Jennifer&#39;s head to understand her. It felt like her mindhad suddenly cleared, as if it had been full of cotton and all the cotton had suddenly been removed. <br />
<br />
“Jennifer, my name is Jennifer” She thought in a perfectly clear human voice. <br />
<br />
“What a pretty name, I’ll let you keep it. Now close your eyes, it will be quick” she said and began whispering as Jennifer closed her eyes. <br />
<br />
She had no choice, her words were so soothing. She felt the cotton fill her head again. It was so soft, as soft as mental cotton could beany ways. Things seemed so much simpler now that her mind wasn’t racing to find a way out of this.<br />
<br />
The woman watched as Jennifer’s body visibly relaxed, the enchantment working its magic on her. <br />
<br />
“Perfect, how are you feeling, Jennifer?” the owner asked as she scratched her ears.<br />
<br />
“HEEE HAWWWW!” She let out a bray. It was a full throated thing, no sign of a human voice behind it.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s my girl” she smiled and touched her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a wonderful thing to be a donkey!&quot; Jennifer communicated by telephathy with her owner.</p>
