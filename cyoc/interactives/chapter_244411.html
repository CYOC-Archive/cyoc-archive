<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken didn&#39;t actually sleep that night to no ill effect because of the &quot;rest&quot; spell that could take the place of actual sleep... It was a personal spell that only actually worked on monsters and not humans due to the magic inherent in monster biology... Really they were mostly utility spells for transportation, shrinking/enlarging items, some defensive spells... boing boing... the &quot;Boing Boing&quot; spell was Public levels of magical radiation, but personal since many people in government saw it as potentially inflation fetish material. It wasn&#39;t air or water since the being was inflated with magic, but it wasn&#39;t that dissimilar. It was more akin to mixing a certain type of magic with a material inflating the material a little and enhancing it&#39;s Elasticity and Springiness. It worked well with his jump skill when used on his feet and... He did learn that sex change... Ken was going to school using Public magic and a few personal spells that had lower magical radiation and he was actually faster than using the bus. After having shrunken his normal clothes, backpack, homework (temporarily with a calculated time for disenchantment), and then went out of his window. <br />
The agents made some hypothesizes about Ken&#39;s anatomy, but they hadn&#39;t done much in terms of psychology... and The fear of looking down a chasm miles down, and having the knowledge that if you slipped you were a goner... Was just gone. Ken made the assumption that at his size/weight/constitution he may get hurt falling a terminal velocity, but it probably wouldn&#39;t be major. Not enough mass or velocity with his springiness. Still with the wind, springiness, tethering, etc. Ken was able to move pretty quickly by abusing physics. He ended up getting to school pretty early thanks to not really needing his bus pass. Really the school was a lot more open to him thanks to his ability to basically go anywhere on the xyz axis instead of the xy axis.<br />
<br />
First Period was his monster theorization elective class. Where many theories were taught about how monsters originally came to be, and to allow students to come up with hypothesizes and while they couldn&#39;t prove them they&#39;d learn quickly if they could be disproven. Was a bit of a mix of folklore, critical thinking, and monster biology all in one... it&#39;s just now there was a living example. It was a surprise to everyone that they now had a non-gang monster in the school, but they were taking it stride as instead of having a &quot;monster monster&quot; it was someone barely an inch tall. With a mage hand it was easy enough for Ken to turn in his homework, do the handouts... That said he had garnered a lot of attention thanks to being a lot less noticeable in a sense. It wasn&#39;t unheard of for someone to come to school as  monster or elf (partially changed), but when that person was less werewolf and more... &quot;cute&quot; it was easier to be approached. The teacher of this period had changed one of his assignments to theorizing about what Ken&#39;s new &quot;race&quot; was or how they functioned. For anyone who wanted to go further into the field theorizing and quickly rejecting/refining theories was important... and it&#39;s not like Ken felt like he was under a microscope yet. Some of the girls were curious and while it was tempting to get on the hands of one of the &quot;pretty&quot; girls who may have also been &quot;pretty&quot; busty he decided to go for the hand of Kim. A short reserved and somewhat homely girl but was nice to have as a work partner. The two chatted while Kim walked him closer to his next class and Ken really enjoyed her personality... if they wanted something more long term... Well... There was a lot magic could do for one&#39;s appearance... and so what if she became a monster, he was one already. <br />
<br />
Then came math, science... Nothing against the stem fields, but Ken&#39;s mind was wondering &quot;When am I going to use THIS?&quot; There were uses for math and the like, but... He had read the spell list suggested, and even the public spell list database and... He could just learn a spell that&#39;d handle any and all calculations he&#39;d ever need. It&#39;s nice to know how chemical reactions worked, but magic could bypass or literally break some of these interactions... In fact he kind of hid behind his textbook so he could skim some spells that would let him break the 1st law of Thermodynamics by literally creating or destroying energy through heating/cooling magic. Really the biggest thing science gave him was the method and most of the knowledge scientists of the non-magical world have given him was... Out of date for any monster. <br />
<br />
The science teacher in the lab then came around to Ken&#39;s station and asked &quot;Sorry Ken, are we boring you here? What happened your usually a good student?&quot; and the science teacher obviously saw Ken reading from his miniaturized smart phone. <br />
&quot;Well... It&#39;s not that science can&#39;t teach me useful things but... I don&#39;t really need to know how to mix a lot of chemicals together to create salt, heat, and a lot of byproducts when... I can just learn the spell, create salt, and end up with a 100% pure salt and no byproducts... and that&#39;s the same for most of the lessons here. It&#39;s nice to know thermic reactions and catalysts but also... The only reason I can&#39;t just create gold out of thin air is because of special interests lobbying the government. Then in P.E... there really was no point. Not only were there spells to help his physical state it was also... designed for humans. He could still run laps but... muscle strengthening magic was a thing and his commute to and from school was significantly more physically demanding AND FUN.... Yeah... between the 3 types of monsters he wasn&#39;t a landlocked mermaid trying to wheelchair herself around the track field, he wasn&#39;t a centaur breaking records running track and field... He was the mage who just didn&#39;t see the point in this self betterment when instead he could just learn the spell in maybe an hour and never need to use a gym again. and Yet the coach wanted to see him run laps around a support beam. The irritation in Ken was building for how pointless this was and... how much authority did the coach really have here?... dangerous thought Ken dangerous thought...</p>
