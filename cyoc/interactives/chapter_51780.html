<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The vast new Master bedroom had been significantly altered by the shock wave of Kurse's <br />
death. It had now been Jensen's well over a decade or now, along with that of his mates. <br />
Everything from the bed to the bathroom were now scaled to their size and designed with <br />
their autonomy. <br />
<br />
Both Kaylee and Jensen after they had been placed in their bedroom (with Sandi and Terri <br />
standing outside as guards for their depleted Alphas), didn't really notice any of this when <br />
they awoke the next morning, later in the morning, they had been up well past midnight <br />
and had fought a battle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee...&quot; Jensen groaned turning over to face the reddish brown she wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear?&quot; She replied to the black as night big bad wolf himself. Now apparently <br />
reformed. <br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't a dream was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dear it wasn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you felt it too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Kaylee shivered, but it wasn't from revulsion as you'd logically think, &quot;All that <br />
existed in the universe that had any meaning was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing that had anything meaning in the universe was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were fused together, united and whole, body, mind, spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perpetually, constantly, never ending...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen then shivered as well making a grunt of sadness. <br />
<br />
Kaylee blinked a tear of loss, Jensen allowed himself to cry for only his mate was here with <br />
him, he didn't need to be Alpha Male only around her, <br />
<br />
Kaylee lamented, &quot;Kurse fulfilled her promise after all...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
On the other side of the world, earlier that morning/day/night. the wolf Sasha had <br />
peacefully kept her distance while Ulysses and Mary in the most non-threatening and <br />
non-agressive manner possible had approached the poor passengers and crew. Sadly, due <br />
to all sharing the experience, and the pain being very real, and the animal people before <br />
them, they couldn't just shrug it off as a nightmare or a hallucination. <br />
<br />
One woman looked very desperate to know where her son was and if anyone had seen <br />
him. In fact this was shared with in fact two other sets of parents (all parents of three). <br />
Whose children were of course at the mansion, human, but very scared and confused who <br />
couldn't go through the mirror without being mutated by the glass pup's magic. <br />
<br />
Their boat was magically (of course) very much intact and ultimately perfectly ready to <br />
start up the engine on a moment's notice. But the fact seven children were missing, left <br />
people very divided on leaving or not. <br />
<br />
One middle aged woman with curly blond locks ran to the two cubs and knelt down and <br />
looked into both their eyes, she shook her head in transparent disappointment. <br />
<br />
Mary lowered her head, &quot;I'm sorry I'm not your child... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHERE IS HE?!&quot; She demanded, she had gone from winning a boat trip with her son to <br />
being turned into a pig monster with endless hunger driven only by base desire and then <br />
fighting a bunch of lion people and then being switched back. <br />
<br />
Sasha keeping her body low stepped foreword a few feet and said, &quot;Kurse, I'm sure you all <br />
know who that is since you were all connected to her, sent most of the children after they <br />
were remade into monsters to kidnap parts of our family... but they failed to be as lethal <br />
as they should have been and we were able to subdue them... I promise none of them are <br />
hurt in anyway...&quot; <br />
<br />
ALL the parents clamored at this along with the two children who had remained on the <br />
island and were human again... the fact most of them had been rendered naked by their <br />
clothes being ruined (and their precious cellphones and credit cards being barely <br />
recovered) left some amused, others delight, the majority humiliated or ashamed. <br />
<br />
The woman who had stepped foreword said, &quot;Is my son there? His name is Dennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lion and wolf looked at each other, no one had a clue what glass or any of the children's <br />
names were. <br />
<br />
Abbey was with glass behind several out-croppings of rocks. <br />
<br />
'Why is she asleep? We don't sleep, not in the outside world... not ever...' <br />
<br />
But unconscious was precisely what Glass was. Or whatever her real name was. Abbey <br />
wondered if she'd be blindly loyal and loving to the pack and Abbey's father as the original <br />
transformation of Abbey's powers stated they would as Alice had explained. <br />
<br />
Sasha meanwhile knew they were trapped. There was no way in Hades any parent worth <br />
their DNA would leave this island without their child, and there was no safe way to bring <br />
their children back to them without mutating them into glass wolves in real time. And <br />
Glass... Sasha shuddered, knowing if it really was Abbey's powers and not an after effect of <br />
Kurse's power, then Glass would be like they had been originally, devotion and willing <br />
slaves to Jensen and the pack.  Glass' mother would barely mean anything to her. Sasha <br />
remembered how she had thought of her own mother as simply a new sources for new <br />
wolves... <br />
<br />
Sasha had never seen one of the glass wolves asleep before, but she was honestly scared <br />
what would happen when Glass woke up... and none of this would change what had to be <br />
done. Technically, Glass' form wasn't locked because she had never been given the special <br />
turn, and neither would the children's as they passed through the mirrorverse... but Sasha <br />
wouldn't wish that kind of psychological trauma on -anyone!- <br />
<br />
All she wanted to do now was SLEEP, along with Mary and Ulysses... the sun was so sunny, <br />
who cared what the island had looked like half an hour ago?... But Sasha resisted the urge, <br />
she had to, Kurse had left this mess in their laps and they had to clean it up now. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Finally getting the sleep she very much needed, falling asleep on a bench in the police <br />
station, Amy couldn't help but have one thought. The cubs had transformed Kaylee in a <br />
way the curse had never predicted, and the triplets and Kaylee had transformed Jensen in a <br />
way that curse could never have foreseen. It made her think of Glass and Kurse, and <br />
couldn't but wonder one thing: if it had been another place, another time, and there had <br />
been enough time, could have Glass transformed Kurse the way the cubs had transformed <br />
Kaylee? Amy knew the absolute truth was... she'd never if know. Like the final scene from <br />
citizen Kane, Amy knew she'd never know Glass could have cured Kurse and made her into <br />
a benign force... But that was a path now doomed to be never explored. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Kat was not the least bit surprised at see nothing on the news of many -many- people <br />
suddenly being mutated... <br />
<br />
Kat... was not all that surprised when her mother didn't react to her being even more cat <br />
than a hour ago... or her mother, father, little brothers, and the mail man who happened <br />
to be close by themselves were now cat people with garishly bright unnatural colored four <br />
with cliche tribal tattoos, the mail man wearing a version of his uniform that couldn't be <br />
standard issue as like Kat it was showing off a lot more of him than even those not <br />
conservative would consider too much to show. The rest of her family was similar dressed, <br />
her mother (her bust having shrunk down to where it was now smaller than Kat's) would <br />
have had a heart attack if they had been dressed like this an hour ago. And to make things <br />
more weird her little brothers were now twins and apparently had traces of -dragon- in <br />
their heritage (she took it as being from her well meaning if somewhat spoiling step-<br />
father). <br />
<br />
What DID surprise Kat was some mail that hadn't been there before, mail from some <br />
modeling agencies... All directed to her. All offering her a job as soon as she finished high <br />
school...  Offering from everything from shampoo to other conditioners to exercise <br />
equipment, there was even one from an artist (her mother would have torn that one up <br />
and set it on fire before Kat would have ever had a chance to read it an hour ago). <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The wolves who hadn't been mutated were the ones who had been all seriously injured, <br />
with the exception of Lawrence who had made no attempt to leave with the rest of the <br />
evacuation, the gem wolves, along with the others mutated during the battle, Betty, <br />
Maxine, and Robyn among them (her twin selves had been named, were named, Roxy and <br />
Brylee). <br />
<br />
While the lions had left, along with their unaltered pack mates, with the exception of Alice <br />
and Abbey, Sasha, Ulysess, and Mary, and of course Darla and Julie. Fran being at the <br />
manor to maintain order. <br />
<br />
The gem wolves plus the four non-gem members, all stood, sat, on lay where the crags <br />
had been, where they had all danced, now it was just a empty sandy field. <br />
<br />
Caroline remembered the dance, from two perspectives at once, as did nearly everyone <br />
else there except Amethyst who had been the dance's conductor. <br />
<br />
And Amethyst just lay on the sand, her bosom that easily surpassed that of even the <br />
triplets pushing up her mass. Her naked body somehow feeling even more naked and <br />
exposed with her special eyes gone as well as the marking that had unified the gem <br />
wolves together in their own special way. <br />
<br />
Weather it had been a branding by the three witches or not, none of them really cared.<br />
<br />
And Amethyst felt another pang of misery... A part of her inside just felt... dead. She <br />
admitted looking back at the person she had been was a perverted, he didn't deserve to <br />
have his life stolen of course, but still a pervert. And she had -liked- being unbreakably <br />
perky, she had LIKED being able to carry her own universe around her, she had liked being <br />
able to keep her soul upbeat no matter what!! She had liked liking cute and pretty things... <br />
they hadn't been manly, but at this point she didn't give a blank. Amethyst remembered <br />
the saying on how ignorance was bliss... and right now she was anything -but- blissful... <br />
she had LIKED that version of herself... <br />
<br />
&quot;She said that she'd make victory so terrible that we'd be pinning for defeat afterwards and <br />
here we are now.&quot;  Amethyst said. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Sitting NOT that very far away at all, lagging behind the rest of the pack on the pretense <br />
of looking after Mary (Brian and Felicity being surprisingly trusting on the subject), were <br />
the midnight lioness and Fox. <br />
<br />
Fox hugged herself, rocking back and forth, &quot;Elise, Pride-sister, you can feel it too huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can... it feels like I'm four boats tied together in rocky seas.... clashing together and <br />
pulling away but never whole and never free...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fox wondered, &quot;Can you hear the other parts too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's more like the men who is men is the sound of four voices echoing off a ceiling. they <br />
call each other by name. Moja. Mbili. Tatuli. Nneili.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like my name is Fox, but our names are Tano, Sita, Saba, Nane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, swahili words for one through eight, or close to it... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we're descent biologically from African lions so it makes some sense...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't get it... shouldn't we have just gone back to the way we were before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it has something to do with Amy's promise. Like it had something over fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; The midnight lioness asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said there would be no deaths... and the chaos.. when Kurse jump started the twins <br />
back to consciousness... they broke off from the infinite chaos... they became <br />
individuals... that made them alive... so they ceased to exist that would mean they would <br />
be dead right? I think that's how fate glued us back together but...&quot; Fox lead on. <br />
<br />
Elise picked up, &quot;But if the two of us really were glued back together it would mean the <br />
eight of us would be dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Fox nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;I, we, feel like I'm in a body a forth of the room it should have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who'd have thought statues and plushies had souls...&quot; Fox looked at the sky. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ask any child or artist. They get them when the artist makes them with everything they <br />
are, and whatever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fox thought about it, &quot;I think I saw that movie on DVD too at a store once..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we've gone from being male police in twenty four hours to lion people with four <br />
souls trapped inside one body each.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both Fox and Elise were tired, but part of them was scared of going to sleep, fearing it <br />
would mean the four parts of themselves 'dying.' <br />
<br />
&quot;If it didn't have to be from that beotch again... &quot; Fox began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Inaheartbeat!&quot; Elise said, her muzzle lips quivering. <br />
<br />
Fox said, &quot;Like all four of us are in a locked room, unable to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Many science fiction writers had theorized that god had shattered itself into all souls in <br />
existence at the moment of realized... Fox wondered if this was such a hypothetical god <br />
felt, you being you, but at the same time, there were parts of you that were also you, and <br />
were a 'themself' that all their own as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think that beotch knew we'd end up feeling this way?&quot; The four souls of Moja / Mbili / <br />
Tatuli / Nneili collectively called Elise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? That sadistic beotch? OF COURSE she knew! If she got beaten and all her <br />
damage was undone, of course she wanted to make sure that taking out the knife would <br />
be worse than leaving it in... she had too big an ego to go down gracefully...&quot; Fox, the <br />
collective name for the four souls Tano, Sita, Saba, and replied. Nane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her 'parting gift?' Eh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The punishment was not the first transformation but the second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fox stated, &quot;I read a lot of fiction... story of a girl whose changed into a fey for being <br />
disrespectful of fairies in modern times. Oberon eventually agrees to change her back, <br />
only THEN does she realize this was his plan all along, and turning her back human had <br />
been the real punishment.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy the beotch is deader than dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fox said with some humor, &quot;Heck yeah, wanna throw a party?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Amethyst and the wolves who had been transformed into twins looked upon the island... it <br />
was so... plain. Like blank paper. <br />
<br />
Everyone was thinking the same thing and through no trick of magic. <br />
<br />
Caroline flashed back to the dance, to an outside observer it was pure and utter madness. <br />
Maybe it had been. But Caroline remembered, the pattern never repeated, the same path <br />
never taken twice, wasn't that in of itself a pattern? After all, perfect chaos meant there <br />
could be no pattern -at all-. But Caroline remembered, always being in two parts during <br />
the dance that had no beginning or ending, which simply was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sis... can't we can't some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt heard the voice of herself, the sound of herself as a little girl. Sounding innocent, <br />
sad, like she had watched her home burn down in front of her eyes. <br />
<br />
Amethyst finally stood up and uprooted a tree with her brute strength, and began to trace, <br />
not planning ahead or taking precise details, only doing what came naturally and letting it <br />
flow. She then threw the tree clear of the clearing and stood in the center, not stepping on <br />
any of the tracing lines. <br />
<br />
The gem wolves stepped into a circle around her, Betty, Lawrence, Robyn and Maine joined <br />
in too along with any others there. Then at an unspoken signal, they began to dance. <br />
Amethyst stayed in the center directing the movements ever so slight so they didn't bang <br />
into each other, Caroline carefully placed her paw on each 'tile' never stepping on the trace <br />
lines, or stepping in the same pattern. <br />
<br />
Infinite possibilities. Infinite paths to explore. All that could be taken, all that possible.  <br />
And in her/her base gut, Caroline/Cobalt knew she/she should be in two place at the <br />
same time, not occupying the same space twice at once. <br />
<br />
So much she could do, she saw them in her mind's eye as she danced, she could build a <br />
hotel on the island with Opal... she could become a model and then the first of the pack to <br />
become an actress... she could become a dancer and eventually teach her talents on to <br />
others... she saw herself as an elderly gray gray wolf surrounded by olympic gold medals, <br />
then at middle aged holding a chain walking with a limp looking at oscars thinking if only <br />
not that for that one accident, she saw her son/daughter, named Cobalt/Coraline and --<br />
<br />
Caroline fell to her knees, the other wolves present soon after began to do much the same. <br />
Caroline realized she was sobbing, and she wasn't alone. <br />
<br />
'Was this... was this what she, they -really- wanted to bring to the world?' Caroline and <br />
Cobalt both thought. <br />
<br />
They saw a trio of young girls doing magic tricks to earn passage on a crowded ship, each <br />
of their parents having been taken by plagues their magic couldn't stop, to the 'New World' <br />
not having even won it's freedom from Great Britain yet... but their great-grandmother <br />
saying it would become 'the land of the free.' <br />
<br />
What they found was a nation almost as bound by laws and rules as the one they had <br />
risked their lives to travel from. They had grown older expanded on their craft, expanded <br />
their power, even learning a trick or two from the locals who were being crowded out by <br />
the new comers who didn't quite realize the people already here were people as well.<br />
<br />
Caroline and Cobalt saw a messiah complex bloom from selfless intention turning to blind <br />
ambition, they saw the 'us' and 'they' mentally form, 'they' being anyone still bound by <br />
rules (they loathed even the harsh rules magic had to follow). <br />
<br />
The twins saw their by now deluded goal of 'liberating' Glendale, tapping into the infinite <br />
chaos without a filter to direct or properly control it. <br />
<br />
Then the damage had started. Driving children insane believing they were 'liberating them' <br />
and encouraging the dissolving of every law on the books. <br />
<br />
No one expects the Inquisition, in particular in America. the Inquisition, born as an excuse <br />
by royalty to seize property (much as the attack on the Knight Templars had been <br />
centuries before), and historically known for it's ruthlessness... It also had the distinct <br />
honor of bringing 'innocent until proven guilty' into practical use. And officially considered <br />
witchcraft to be an absurdity ... <br />
<br />
Unofficially there were innocent people who needed protecting from those who were not <br />
so innocent. Five 'witch hunters' (though they never ever referred to themselves as such). <br />
<br />
The death of the witches, the curse, people realizing how powerful calling someone a <br />
witch was, spite turning towards land owners and the like, five voices of reason who knew <br />
what a witch actually did... drowned out. <br />
<br />
Cobalt and Caroline gasp. <br />
<br />
&quot;... before revenge... before the chaos drove them insane... before they started seeing <br />
people with magic as mindless machines... before they saw themselves as better than <br />
everyone else... this was what they wanted... a world were all possibilities could be <br />
explored...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline wanted to step away from each other then and there and continue the <br />
dance in their duet as they should... but they couldn't, they only had one body now... <br />
<br />
&quot;Monster, witch, curse, thing of evil, it said it would make us want defeat... &quot; Cobalt and <br />
Caroline whispered. Kurse had fulfilled her promise. Not by making the cost too high. <br />
<br />
'What is this? We were like that for what? A few hours? But... how long have been a pack <br />
member? A week? A few days?...  We had a self enough to appreciate it for how long? A <br />
few minutes? I knew Opal for how long before I fell in love with them? ... What difference <br />
does time make at all? If love is for a moment or a century... ' <br />
<br />
Kurse had no comprehension of love in of itself... sadly, this had proven untrue of her wolf <br />
twins...</p>
