<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Ethan went to school his the box in his bag.<br />
<br />
Last night Ethan hatched a plan. He would wait until lunch and then go to Marks office. When Mark answered the door, Ethan would asked to looked through the box of lost trainers for his and once he was inside, Ethan would quickly knock out Mark. <br />
<br />
Ethan sat through the first three lessons of the day and finally ouch came around. As he walked to Marks office, his heart began to pound faster and faster. He finally reached a door that read &quot;Mr M.Richards head of P.E.&quot;. Ethan stood there for a thew minutes trying to build up the courage to knock on the door. Eventually Ethan managed to knock on the door and sure enough, in a few seconds, the door opened and greeted Ethan with Marks handsome, bearded face. &quot;I think I might have left my trainers he last week, can I have look?&quot; Asked Ethan trying to seem as chilled out as possible. &quot;Sure, come in, the lost property box is just over there&quot; answered Mark as walked back to his desk. Ethan went to the box first and waited to make sure that Mark wasn&#39;t looking and then Ethan crouched and slowly walked behind him, not making a sound. All Ethan could hear was the pounding of his heart as adrenaline rushed through his body. Once he was right behind the chair, Ethan sprung up and clenched both of his hands together into one and hit Mark on the back of the head as hard as he could. Marks face hit the keyboard with a thud. Ethan was breathing very heavily as he ran to make sure that the door was locked and blinds were down.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t waste anytime because Mark may be knocked out now but he could wake up at any minute. Ethan pulled of Marks trainers and ankle socks to reveal his big hairy feet which made Ethan grow hard as he had slight foot fetish. Next he pulled of marks black short to show that he was wearing grey boxers underneath with a very large bulge infront. Ethan then proceeded to take of marks green t-shirt, realign his muscular, hairy chest. Ethan couldn&#39;t help but rub the hair, it was so attractive. Now Mark was sitting in the chair in just his grey boxers. Ethan gave a bit of an unapproprite licking of his lips as he took of the boxers and revealed marks huge penis massive testicals. Not only did marks penis have incredible length but it had incredible girth to match.<br />
<br />
Ethan went and started to rub marks penis until it became hard in his hand. It was like all Ethan&#39;s dreams were coming true all at once. Next Ethan took of his clothes aswel and the got the box out of the bag. He opened the box and took the super numbing cream and rubbed it over his testicals. Ethan was gonna do the same to Marks but he guessed that Mark wouldn&#39;t feel anything anyway because he was Unconscious. Next Ethan got one syringe and injected it into his testicals and sucked out as much semen as possible which wasn&#39;t as much as he thought it would be. Marks testicals were about three times the size so Ethan got almost three times more semen out of him.<br />
<br />
Ethan the proceeded to mix each sample of semen with some of the activation potion. Then he injected his semen into Marks testicals and they looked rather empty. Then he injected Marks semen into his testicals and they were so full they felt as if they were gonna burst.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Ethan began to get taller as his legs grew longer and muscular and soon became coated  with hair. Then his testicals began early to expand as they still felt full but not as if they were gonna burst anymore. At the same time, Ethan&#39;s penis grew longer and thicker. The changes spread up his torso to his stomach that that that before was quite rounded but was now flattening itself out and growing a trail of hair that led to the bush around his penis. Then his chest began to grow out two sexy pecs which were soon covered in thick brown hair. Suddenly Ethan&#39;s shoulder got bigger and his arms grew bigger and muscular as they too grew hair that spread down the knuckles of his enlarging hands. Next his face began early to change its bone structure as it became more adult like. His eyes went from green to blue as his eyebrows got thicker and his hair colour went from light brown to dark brown. Ethan then felt really tingly as thick beard grew on his face.<br />
<br />
As all that happened. Ethan didn&#39;t even notice that the opposite had happened to Mark who now looked like him.<br />
<br />
*Okay readers, I may continue the story but be aware that there will probably be no more change but there may be a bit more naughty elements so stay tuned*</p>
