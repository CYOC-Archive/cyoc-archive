<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gross. What wicked options were these?<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t want to choose any. So she decided on that. A couple of blinks with her eyes, and the text seemed to fade. See? That wasn&#39;t so bad.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, as she was preparing a sandwich for herself, her vision was once again assaulted by similar text. Her face betrayed surprise, as she read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No choice made, picking one at random.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen got incredibly dizzy, as she found her vision shift. Seen from a different perspective, her eyes started rolling vertically in her sockets, as they were turning like the images on a jackpot machine or a wheel of fortune. She got startled, as her mind couldn&#39;t cope with this mental attack. The images in front of her slowed down, first, her right eye got back into position, showing an image in the shape of a beast, some kind of ape going wild. A couple of seconds later, her left eye also stayed put, showing the same thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trait picked, number 1. Bestial tendencies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer immediately regretted not having made a choice herself. What did that mean? Just, think about the slightest bit of arousal and your mind goes crazy already? Increased libido? She was worried about how the day would progress.<br />
<br />
She was just about to exit her house, as she found his parents arriving by car, onto the driveway. She thought they&#39;d exit the car to meet her, but from a distance, Jen could see her parents had completely different plans.<br />
<br />
As if it was nothing, her mother jumped onto her father&#39;s lap, stripping entirely naked. Her father protested first, but his gaze changed into that of a madman a few seconds later, only to go with the flow.<br />
<br />
Jennifer watched the spectacle in horror at first, but the sight of it... It got her horny too.<br />
<br />
Gosh, they were just going at it? And this was normal. Jennifer&#39;s eyes were stuck to this sight. She subconsciously brought two of her fingers to underneath her skirt and started touching herself. Juice was already flowing down her pussy, and it lubricated her crotch as she ran her fingers over it. Inside of her she was wet, and they slipped in easily.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s eyes shot away from the sight, averting her eyes from them. Gross, my own parents. Shit, I need to get away from here.<br />
<br />
She ran into the kitchen, where she&#39;d been preparing a sandwich. Her mind couldn&#39;t get itself to rationalize, she was thrusting her fingers in and out of her pussy, but was in need of a bigger replacement. And what would a sandwich be without cucumber? She eagerly licked her lips, unable to get herself to think, and following her instincts like any other animal. The long, cylindrical vegetable fit right in. Loud moans escaped her mouth, as she thrust it in and out of her. The muscles of her pussy wrapped themselves around it, and clenched tight, as Jen&#39;s pace increased. Her breathing sped up, as well as her heart-rate, juices flowed out of her cunt, down her legs and the now wet vegetable she was holding. In the background, she heard some noise, but she didn&#39;t care enough to react to it.<br />
<br />
She heard some shouting, but she almost reached her climax. She found someone holding a firm grasp on her, as her moans turned to screams. The cucumber stretched her pussy to its limits, but it felt so good! Jennifer was in bliss. Her pussy clenched around the cucumber one last time, as she felt someone else pull the vegetable out of her. It did the trick for her, as every muscle in her body tensed, and loud moans and cries of joy and pleasure escaped her mouth. From underneath her skirt, juices jetted down onto the floor, in three large and long-lasting spurts.<br />
<br />
Her mind and body finally calmed down, as Jen entered her state of afterglow. She came to notice her surroundings again, and found both her parents near her.<br />
<br />
Her father was holding Jen at her shoulders, a firm grasp with both his hands. Her mother stood behind her, holding a wet cucumber in her hands. It smelled like sex in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
The realization dawned on Jen, and she blushed in shame and horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, dad, I can explain!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you out of your mind?!&quot; Her mother exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Oh no, now she&#39;d done it. Tears welled up in Jen&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetheart, take your dildo the next time you get urges. A cucumber is for eating, not for masturbating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eh?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother clacked her tongue, as she threw the green rod into the garbage bin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then why do they call it a cuCUMber?&quot; Mother said to father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously woman,&quot; he spoke, &quot;if we weren&#39;t in a state of afterglow right now, that joke would get you penetrated once more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughter, Jen couldn&#39;t follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah well,&quot; father spoke, &quot;at least we aren&#39;t too late for your home school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Home school?<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we had our sexy time too, just then.&quot; Father answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say the lessons will be delayed, but I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have to make you wait?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, I don&#39;t get to go to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s parents laughed. &quot;No of course not, silly!&quot; Mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know you love hearing it every now and then.&quot; Father began.  &quot;You&#39;ve indeed turned out to be one of the most gorgeous girls of your age. We don&#39;t want to risk having you pregnant so soon though, with all these horny guys only charging at you. So we&#39;re home schooling you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother cleared her throat. &quot;Has your sister woken up yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s gone to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Yeah right!&quot; Father called out. The same thing goes for your sister Jennifer. He stood up, and headed towards the stairs. &quot;Emma!&quot; He exclaimed, as he walked to the second floor.</p>
