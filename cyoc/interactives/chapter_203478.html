<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even as Ken stood with his nose only inches from her soaking wet black folds; his big Mule dong began to raise stiff and find the mark a wanted occasion. Quick was his passion for her at that moment when Ken walked around the plank board wall and allowed his cock to rise straining skyward or bust. Ken stood then as taller, his hoofs, feet, hocks and legs having grown, and adjusting his height.<br />
<br />
Ken had stood watching the mare with lusty interest; he wanting their first equine mating ritual to commence soon, as the blunt tip of his aroused cock did part the vulva lips of one shivering mare. Both the mare and her Mule mate were ogling the other, each straining their new and strange vision; as Ken began the thrusting to stimulate her. The colors of his mostly black cock went unnoticed by either; as she wanted him to sensually stir her to feeling alive for a fun reason. Wholly not noticed by Ken was at its sheath and base half of his cock was black and the mottled tan human flesh coloring began just above the medial ring. His cock was colorful, being somewhat human but enhanced sensually, especially the flared blunt end where the black hue had taunted his mare.<br />
<br />
It was then, that a past thought came to remind Ken of his parents insisting his penis be as circumcised; mostly for religious reasons, but the Reformation serum caused a virtual stretching of his human penis with a constant domed crown. The knowledge of his cock being made blunt ended, was a sight he had long hence wanted to see become as his. The stout new length and bulk weight of his shaft made Ken wonder as to how such a flat flared cock could enter the sexy lips of she a mare. <br />
<br />
The young female had become a mare for longer than a week before she saw and met then with a changing Ken. She was prepared to feel a blunt end of one stiff equine cock push at, and bulge through her slick, quivering sex. <br />
<br />
Ken felt a love for that mare, as if sure by her scent that she too were born firstly as human before then becoming a mare. He felt a dire sense of concern about the blunt end and his draft animal size shaft causing the mare pain when he pressing it harshly, it invaded into a female. Indeed, there was the need for a mare to expel, coat her vulva with silken juices.<br />
<br />
The pressing and poked jab of Ken inserting inside the mare jerked her head up from where she had it hung low to consign her being submissive to mating.<br />
<br />
Many other previously unconsidered physical facts were part of the forefront of both their lusty considerations. The sudden eruption of body hot fluid spewing out the cock when it was embedded deep; made Ken jerk his head up to mark a sense of attention; he braying loudly.<br />
<br />
The morning mating session had others watching, the Scientist was there, and a young trainee by the name of Joe was working, going about the needs and desires of bodily needs to horses and donkeys. These animals were in his care before Ken had arrived, but with the mare and her mating a Mule, such things few changelings then ever even considered or as yet felt the urge to breed. <br />
Ken though thought very seriously of their actions, as to his manner of stance, and body attitudes had new meanings. A rich scent of mare urine mixed with the sour sweaty stench of Joe filled the air inside their stall. Ken shook his bigger head as odd scents entered his nostrils and quickly became thoughts in his changing brain. Turning to look at what felt very odd concern for, Ken saw then Joe standing close by, he watching A large cock of a male Mule stretch forth to meet it&#39;s first grand entrance and showing.<br />
<br />
Then it was Wendy&#39;s turn to look past Ken as was Joe so enthused by what he was close enough to caress, his bladder released a flow. Blinking his eyes Kevin stood rigid above and busily thrusting, while young Joe pissed his jeans below the mating pair. Oddly, Joe did not seem to mind his stream spewed from out his enhanced penis, as his morning coffee held a dose of Reformation serum.<br />
<br />
Joe stood still and watching up close, he sniffing the puddle of urine collecting about his sandals&#39;.  He questioned of why he wanted to fill his nose and little mind with the scents of that most passionate moment. Joe leaned closer, as stretching, placing his punk nose strained to reach him the Mule and her the mare&#39; vulva scent; as he too was aroused-erect, his penis gradually becoming an equine cock, as it wriggled free from his underwear, to bounce off a hairy thigh. <br />
Ken noticed and was distracted from his happy mating duties, as he cocked his head to begin watching what he knew was soon to be a male donkey about to masturbate. It was easy for Ken to see and appreciate of how much passion Joe had built up from watching the breeding session. A quick look up at Wendy, Ken saw how she showed her disdain of a human being so close, as with her height above Joe, while Ken slowed his thrusts, she let go her bladder to drench Joe&#39;s ultimate desire. It came raining down as he knelt watching, he feeling useless of hope, wishing he could do such a mounting; Kevin realized then of Joe would soon find and learn of his place at some farm.<br />
<br />
When Joe would become a donkey and capable still to mate a female or some pony mare as willing or rank with desire, Joe had no chance to feel their passion. Yet to sniff the scent of Wendy and Ken there in that barn, and he as Joe the stable boy could only masturbate; he spewing the hot seed on the dry ground would mark as such a letdown.<br />
<br />
Ken finishing with his mare mate, he snorted loudly which at the moment broke Wendy&#39;s thoughts of passion and made Joe turn to give a damp feeling look upward. The dull look which Joe had showed his disdain from being soaked by mare urine, as his lusty mental desire was for feeling of sexual passion. <br />
As Ken began to retract his cock from the depths of his mare, a fair amount of her vaginal juices mixed well with spent semen to then seep out past both cock and vulva lips to dribble of long strings into the agape open mouth of Joe. They knew from informed by the scientist as to the infectious nature their sexual bodily fluids had on humans.<br />
As Joe did relish the varied flavors he swallowed, Ken knew that Joe would soon see, realize, and begin to appreciate his bodily transition from of what he was as born to becoming a donkey animal. The semen was enough of an infecting substance, but of mare juices too, Ken wondered what gender Joe would enjoy when he became a donkey.<br />
<br />
Joe could see by the stance of the male Mule when humping, as just how much he, Joe wanted to be humping a female. The noted expression that Joe showed of eyes closed, a mouth partially open and his head hung back that the semen Ken had ejaculated out was dripping from the mare&#39;s cunt, coating then the gray hairs on his changing chin.<br />
<br />
As Ken withdrew his cock from the mare&#39;s cunt, it fell down as went into the still open, as wanting of more mouth that was Joe. A few dense globs of Mule semen slid out and into Joe&#39;s mouth, just as a Mule bladder urged to finish the cleansing of the cock by a sudden gush; as Ken held his tail high and spewed young Joe a urinary chaser. <br />
<br />
Ken then stepped away from Wendy, as three squirts of male Mule urine seemed enough volume to about drown Joe to drinking in the semen and other leavings. Minutes passed and after some time of wandering in circles, Ken stopped to give a questioning look at Joe, he still kneeling by the mare. <br />
<br />
Ever so suddenly did Joe open his eyes, and raised his head high. The mixed essences of mare stink and equine male instincts had a direct relation upon his changing ideas of his social patterns. Rank thoughts became the rationalization of Joe and his wants for a changed lifestyle. Suddenly the fact of becoming infected with change was quite apparent from his recent actions. Thinking for a moment as might a man, and again Joe took note how his body was different, fast disconcerting of his reasoning mind. He was not thinking thoughts but instead learning patterns of instinct actions and reactions. These were the ways to life for an animal, and Joe was for fact becoming very much an animalistic beast with a weakening mind.<br />
<br />
A creaking sound and the three looked toward the Dutch door to their home. As it opened, Ken caught sight of the Scientist-Doctor and with him was one of his previous animal control helpers. Lynn was a tough guy and had helped many a time with subjects or volunteers who were not cooperative as they changed. His being there to manage what was fast happening to Joe, he gaining a donkey disguise.<br />
<br />
Lynn stepped first to Ken the almost grown Mule, and pressed over his head a bridle and the steel bit to control the beast he was and wanted. Standing docile, Ken let the man do his work knowing that to fight would be both futile and painful. Wendy whinnied a good bye as Ken was led out the stall and out of sight. The brick aisle echoed the hoofs clip-clop sounds of Ken leaving Wendy and young Joe to their futures; each engrossed by a lusty feeling of euphoria. <br />
As favored scents had dulled his thinking, the sensations and sounds did their part to tear down the last of Ken&#39;s more human thought patterns. He walked or when feeling the tug on the bit he stood then calm and willing. Ken watched as Lynn picked up leg after leg, and he nailed as attached iron horse shoes to each hoof. A shake of his head and twitching of an ear was due to the tight hold Lynn held, as the tattooed number was imprinted on the inside upper lip of a new male Mule. <br />
<br />
&quot;You in there, as know by being so marked, you are a Mule now and permanently. This, your number there makes you a recorded piece of property to the Sunrise Farm. I don&#39;t understand the why and way your changes so occurred. The speed to which this new form took hold was one that I must check into. If I could increase the speed of change due to further experiments, I could triple the profit margin!<br />
<br />
Lynn here was informed of who you were and is looking forward to being a big helper to your new life here at the farm, since you have by breeding shown of having accepted a lower status.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken was thinking with every passing instance that those around him felt his being an animal was becoming his truer self. Looking around him, Ken felt lowly as his place like never before. Even when being hollered at when pushing paper in an office he felt still a man when the clock chimed five. As then the use of a clock had lost its meaning in his world of animal life. The time of five O-clock would never come and he was on duty as a male Mule by day and night till the last second of life.<br />
<br />
Weighty irons shoes nailed to his hoofs were an aid to Ken finding himself treated as a common farm animal when turned out to graze in the large pasture, and he to meet the horses kept there with him. Yet though, as he stood on a higher level, being still a virile male, the geldings and mares were subservient to him the larger of all equine beasts.</p>
