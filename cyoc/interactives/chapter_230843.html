<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I observe the kids walking in my direction with a tight knot in my stomach, fearing the moment they start talking to me in their strange language and I don&#39;t know how to respond.<br />
<br />
I swallow saliva. For a moment there I pondered the idea of running to the opposite direction. Or to even try jumping into the river and swim to the other shore. But I immediately discard it. I still know nothing about the African tribe this body belongs to, I don&#39;t know about their culture, their... personality. How do they treat those who do not fit into their standards? If they suddenly go and decide to turn me into an outcast I&#39;ll be straight up fucked. I have no hopes that I&#39;ll be able to adapt and survive by myself in this arid savannah. <br />
<br />
If the worst comes to fruition I would try to follow this river&#39;s course, knowing that at some point it has to lead to the sea shore, where I should be able to find some degree of civilization. However, I haven&#39;t the slightest idea of where I actually am, and Africa is not precisely &quot;small&quot;, so this river might be just a few miles long or might go on and on for thousands upon thousands of kilometers. I might starve along the way or get eaten by a lion, who knows.<br />
<br />
Nuh-uh, I really don&#39;t wanna risk it, and I know very well that running away from the tribespeople will put a target over my head, so I have no option other than to meddle with them, as quietly as I can.<br />
<br />
So I glance at the approaching kids with a forced smile and calmly wet my hands in the water, feigning indifference.<br />
<br />
There might be 16 or 17 of them, all laughing and talking to each other. Most of them seem younger than &#39;me&#39;, but there are a very few who are clearly taller and more mature. The group gives off a very high level of chaotic energy which is to be expected from a gathering of unsupervised infants. However, there seems to be a pattern here, like you can distinguish some degree of hierarchy simply by watching the younger kids running and frolicking around the older ones like a pack of wolf pups asking the adults for approval all while playing amongst themselves.<br />
<br />
The moment the younglings arrive into the river, a good chunk of them immediately go in and start splashing the water with abandon. Most of them seem to ignore me, but there are others who start pointing in my direction, moving their hands in what it seems to be a greeting. I return their smiles and greet them back while I actively struggle to understand their gibberish. <br />
Of course, I completely fail to make any sense of it, except for a single word they keep repeating while greeting me.<br />
<br />
&#39;Adil&#39;. They say that many times, which makes me wonder if it means &#39;Hello&#39; in their language.<br />
<br />
I suddenly find myself completely surrounded by loud kids playing in the muddy water without a clue of how to behave myself in order to not appear suspicious. So I decide to drop my ass into the water, smile still on. And I even make sure to return the splashes some of the kids playfully throw at me, my mind fully focused on appearing relaxed and harmless.<br />
<br />
They are all butt-naked, I notice. Both boys and girls playing together without minding their nudity, tiny peckers and underdeveloped titties mixing indiscriminately in a chaotic mess of wet ebony-skinned figures and physical appearances that look astonishingly similar to one another, save for a few distinguishable differences in their features.<br />
<br />
I sigh deeply, hoping that they will keep disregarding my presence for a while longer until I can get up and sneak away.<br />
However, as soon as I think that... I hear a quiet splash at my right, followed by a pleasant feminine voice that is clearly talking to me.<br />
<br />
I glance at the origin of that voice, getting very surprised to find an almost fully matured girl crouching forward, hands on knees and her pretty face beaming at me. Her features seem softer than most, her thin nose giving her a distinguished feeling that the other kids lack.<br />
However, my eyes immediately go down to that pair of hanging breasts and youthful hips, so smooth and round they seem to reflect the sunlight.<br />
<br />
I gulp down and turn my face away, but the girl keeps talking to me like I&#39;m her friend.<br />
Well, for all I know, I probably &#39;am&#39;. Good lord, this is such a mess. How do I even respond to her without setting off the alarms?<br />
<br />
But as if destiny just now decided to give me a hand, a deeper, rougher voice starts yelling from the back.<br />
That voice comes from who it seems to be the eldest member of the group: A boy half a head taller than me who looks like he&#39;s around 15 years old. He has a peculiar pair of protruding round ears that reminds me of that of a mouse, but the characteristic that really puts him apart from the rest, more so than his height, is the fully developed bush proudly displayed over his male genitalia, whose size is also nothing to scoff at.<br />
<br />
The whole pack of kids immediately stop their water games and turn away to follow Mouseface (I&#39;m gonna call him that), returning to their previous shenanigans of yelling and running around, which seem to be their default state when making headway.<br />
<br />
I silently pray that they will leave me alone. But the pretty girl, who is also following them, stops for a moment and starts making gestures for me to come.<br />
I cuss quietly and stand up, finding myself without an easy way out. Then I go back to the shore where the girl is at, my naked feet stepping over the mud. The moment we are side by side, I notice surprised that she is also slightly taller than me. However, she isn&#39;t looking at my face anymore. She is looking somewhere bellow.<br />
<br />
I unconsciously follow her sight... all down to my crotch, where my long naked dick is hanging down in a manner that reminds me of a giant sleeping anaconda who can&#39;t be bothered to hide her formidable body because there is no one crazy enough to challenge her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; I scream, suddenly feeling very &#39;exposed&#39;. Then immediately put my hands over my crotch, knees turned inwards in an attempt to cover my private parts.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s funny. I would&#39;ve had the exact same reaction were I still in my old body, but for very different reasons.<br />
<br />
Of course, covering this body&#39;s massive dong with only my hands is next to impossible, a predicament that the girl seems to find extremely funny because she starts laughing at me while merrily pointing at my crotch.<br />
I furrow my eyebrows at her, unaware of what to make of this situation. But before I know, she steps forward and shoves me with both hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuaaaaagh!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden attack takes me completely by surprise and, as a result, I lose by balance, stumbling backwards and falling over my ass back into the water where it just came from. I stare back at the girl looking like a complete idiot while she keeps laughing her ass off, uttering words that I don&#39;t need to understand to know that she is mocking me.<br />
<br />
Jibey (I decided to call her that) then turns away and goes back to the main group while glancing back at me in a playful way as if telling me to stop lazing around and come. It&#39;s hard to tell because of her dark-brown skin, but it almost looks like she&#39;s blushing.<br />
<br />
For the second time in a minute, I cuss quietly. For the second time, I sepparate my ass from the muddy water. And also for the second time, I get back to the shore, feet sinking in the mud and water dripping from my swaying dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is fucking nuts...&quot; I say quietly, still feeling so deattached from this raspy childish voice that, instead of my own words, it feels like it&#39;s this body&#39;s original owner trying to warn me.<br />
<br />
However, I can do nothing but shrug my shoulders and follow after them, my attention now divided between Jibby&#39;s fully naked ass and my own wet dong constantly hitting my thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so damn bothersome...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, after 10 minutes of walking near the shore...</p>
