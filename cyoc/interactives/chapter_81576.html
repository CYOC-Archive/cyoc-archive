<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another 10 minutes went by and the traffic wasn't clearing. Danny had reached 50 years old now, his beard a <br />
mixture of grey and white hairs that had grown longer than Mark's own impressive facial hair, the tip now <br />
touching the bulk of his ever expanding belly. He looked ready to break down into tears of frustration and <br />
anger. Mark couldn't take it any more and grabbed his phone to call home. He might get in serious trouble, but <br />
he couldn't leave Danny in this condition. Just as he was about to dial the number, an familiar shiver went <br />
through his body. He looked at Danny and he was completely different. He was still a hairy, fat man, but his <br />
body language was no longer tense and fragile. He was a lot more relaxed and gave off an air of calmness <br />
despite the situation they were in. Mark was confused yet relieved. Maybe someone had gotten to the Chronivac <br />
after all.<br />
<br />
Back home, the Chronivac automatically started up, the sounds unnoticed by the three men downstairs. As soon <br />
as it booted up, it changed to Danny's profile and a message appeared. &quot;Safeguard mode. Subject's stress <br />
levels due to transformation reaching peak levels. Adjusting subject's &quot;awareness levels&quot; to lowest setting: <br />
Unaware of transformation. Adjustment complete&quot;. A pulse of energy spread out, only vaguely felt by Simon who <br />
assumed it was a cold shiver, and the machine switched itself off. Downstairs, Simon thought about the work he <br />
had to do, mainly taxes and finances. The stuff he didn't have to do back when he was 13. He could probably <br />
put it off as it's not due for a few weeks and this simulation was only meant to last another few days, but he <br />
hated to leave it. He was even thinking of extending the simulation for another week or so as they all seemed <br />
to be enjoying their new lives, but he'd have to let everyone in on the decision. He didn't feel comfortable <br />
making such drastic changes without everyone else knowing. He'd get a start on it later.<br />
<br />
Mark was waiting for whoever used the Chronivac to then turn everyone back to their original ages, yet his <br />
muscular, hairy body stayed the same as it was. In fact, he could see that his nephew-turned-uncle was still <br />
getting older, as he rolled over to 51. He glanced at the man and said &quot;so how are you feeling? Are you still <br />
having those weird memories about being younger?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mark thought he saw a look of confusion under the old man's hair covered face and said &quot;Weird memories? I <br />
haven't had any memories like those recently, no. I'm feeling quite fine, maybe a bit annoyed at myself for <br />
taking the highway again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mark tested the waters further. &quot;So you don't remember the panic you had this morning during our jog?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Danny shook his head and said &quot;Maybe you're the one with the weird memories. I haven't been jogging since I <br />
was your age. Not since I broke both my legs in that skiing incident. I'd love to get back into shape but once <br />
the fat comes, it doesn't seem to stop in our family. I hope you keep it away as long as you can, don't let <br />
your grandpa get you down&quot;. He adjusted his seat slightly as his stomach grew out a bit further.<br />
<br />
Mark was about to dispute him when the appropriate memories came to mind. He even remembered that Danny would <br />
sometimes drive him to and from the gym. He'd occasionally come in with him to attempt to get back into <br />
exercise, but he always gave up after about a week. Today was one of those days. They hung about in the <br />
traffic for a further 45 minutes before the traffic started moving. Mark watched as his uncle aged to 60 years <br />
old. He was looking a lot like Santa now. His beard was completely white and grew out in a messy fashion, <br />
sticking out in various directions. He'd occasionally pat it down to a respectable look but it would just get <br />
messy again. His horseshoe fringe of hair was also white and was starting to lengthen slightly. If his beard <br />
were shorter, you'd see the thick hair sticking out of his shirt was a mixture of black and white hair. He had <br />
to sit in an uncomfortable position to reach the steering wheel without his belly pressing against the horn, <br />
and he'd grumble to himself about his back pains and how he needed to lose weight. Although he was now Simon's <br />
twin, if only for the next 5 minutes, they looked nothing alike, much like Jay and Mark. His eyes lit up <br />
behind his glasses as the traffic started to move. He grinned at his nephew and they were back home within 10 <br />
minutes. Mark helped the man get out of the car and into the house, he needed a cane to get around due to his <br />
leg injuries and excess weight, yet luckily for him it didn't seem to affect his driving. After saying hello <br />
to his brother and grandfather, Mark ran up the stairs and into Simon's bedroom, ready to stop this once and <br />
for all. He opened the door and froze when he saw the man at the computer, his shaved scalp shining under the <br />
light and a bunch of papers spread out around him. Simon turned to see who entered and gave him a look of <br />
suspicion. &quot;Hey Mark. What's the matter?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mark tried to compose himself and said &quot;Oh, I came up to let you know me and uncle Dan are back now. Say, what <br />
are you doing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Simon scratched his white beard, and rubbed his forehead with his fingers. He looked stressed out. &quot;Just some <br />
finance stuff for the shop. I thought it wouldn't take that long but it looks like I'm going to be here a <br />
while. If you want to use the computer, I'd suggest you ask your brother to borrow his&quot;. <br />
<br />
Mark sighed and left the room. Coming downstairs, he saw Danny taking a nap in his recliner. He was 62 years <br />
old, and looked every bit his age, maybe even older. He'd calculated that the man was aging just under 1 year <br />
every 5 minutes. He knew Simon could get frustrated easily when put under pressure. He didn't want to risk <br />
angering him in case he did something rash like break the Chronivac. He just had to hope Simon finished before <br />
Danny ended up even older than Bryan.</p>
