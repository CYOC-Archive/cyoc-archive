<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The interior of the shop was very modern. Everything in the back was glass and stainless steel, meticulously maintained. The others were busy, milling about and trying to manhandle some of the crates without dropping them. There was something off about them, but Charlie couldn’t quite put a claw on what.<br />
<br />
“Hey Charlie, did you get the code?’ Hagerd asked, his voice oddly nasally.<br />
<br />
Charlie looked over at the orca and did a double-take. <br />
<br />
His muzzle was longer, almost comically so, and so heavy it drooped at the tip. Hagerd&#39;s nostrils hadn&#39;t expanded at all. The orca cleared his throat rather wetly. His nose began to twitch violently, stretching further down his face. Hagerd opened his mouth, eyes wide, sucked in a heavy breath. And then he sneezed. It sounded like a fart.<br />
<br />
The blast seemed to pull his elongated muzzle further down his face, touching the top of his chest. Hagerd reached up, looking embarrassed, and felt his nose. The ram’s eyes flickered in surprise, then horror, then confusion. He used his fingers to lift his nose, his breath hard, like it was heavy. His nose swayed as he held it aloft and spoke.<br />
<br />
“Thorry. Mtht be the dutht in the air.” Hagerd said. <br />
<br />
Charlie couldn’t help but notice Hagerd’s mouth seemed to have pulled up toward his elephantine nose, giving it a puckered look. His upper lip had lost its distinction and was right beneath the still-twitching nose. Hagerd sneezed again and his drooping muzzle formed a rounded tip, the nostril-holes seeming to close.<br />
<br />
“Uh...yeah, sure. Dust.” Charlie said, feeling confused and frightened.<br />
<br />
The ram let the brown-furred appendage drop. It obscured his mouth. Whatever he said next was muffled. Charlie thought the whole thing rather strange and moved over to the safe. It was against the wall, next to some crates. Prince Gregory was nearby, standing on tippy-pads to gather jars of cologne from the shelves and placing them in a straw-padded crate.<br />
<br />
“Hello Charles,” Gregory said as the wolf crouched down to inspect the safe. <br />
<br />
“Hey,” Charles said, trying to concentrate. What had the number been?<br />
<br />
“I think I bit my tongue,” The mink said, and Charlie watched the mink swish his tongue around inside of his mouth, “Can you check it out?”<br />
<br />
Charlie sighed impatiently and set down his tools. “Alright, open up.”<br />
<br />
The mink did, opening his mouth wide and sticking out his tongue.<br />
<br />
Charlie stared in shock. What had once been a light pink flat tongue was now deep red, cylindrical and round with a pointed tip. It even curved a bit, flopping out of the mink’s muzzle. Now that he was looking, the Prince’s bottom jaw seemed oddly loose as well.<br />
<br />
“Looks...swollen,” Charlie said, staring at the mink’s tongue with concern. “We’ll visit a healers after this.”<br />
<br />
Gregory nodded, reaching up a paw and stroking his tongue. He shivered, eyes going cross, as though it felt rather nice. The tongue seemed to swell a bit more under the mink’s touch.<br />
<br />
“Thorry,” Gregory lisped, slurping up some drool as he played with his tongue, “It’th tho thenthitive. Tathtes weird too.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll bet.” Charlie said, blinking at it. <br />
<br />
The Prince returned to his task, his tongue still poking from his lips. Charlie took a calming breath and went back to dealing with the safe. His mind raced as he tried to remember the code. 07-04-73. Ha! He remembered! The wolf reached out and dialed in the proper configuration.<br />
<br />
As he did, a tingle shot through his claws and up to his head. Charlie shook and shuddered, fur standing on end. The tingle faded and his fur settled back into place. Weird. He opened the safe and paused, flexing fingers that had suddenly gone a bit stiff.<br />
<br />
Charlie took a moment to rub his face, which began to tingle pleasantly. He wriggled his muzzle, feeling it droop a bit. It felt strangely sensitive to his touch, perking when he stroked it. His mind whirred and he didn’t notice his dark fur grow longer, glossier, a white stripe running down his stomach.<br />
<br />
He placed the contents of the safe into a crate, his hands growing increasingly useless. Finally, with a crack, they popped backwards, bones re-configuring. Charlie stared stupidly at the paws his hands hand been replaced with. He wiped his nose, which was drooling something onto his belly.<br />
<br />
“Gregory,” He croaked, “can you *Pppbbrt*?”<br />
<br />
A foul smelling burp erupted from Charlie’s mouth. He swished his tongue about, face crinkling in distaste. It smelled like a skunk, though his sense of smell was growing fainter. His tongue throbbed and he gasped, nose perking again as a pleasurable sensation shot to his brain. <br />
<br />
“Ohh..*urpppbt*!” Charlie moaned, another foul smelling burping leaking from his mouth.<br />
<br />
His stomach was churning somewhat fierce, but Charlie’s mind was fuzzy. Something heavy was growing from his forward, something oddly droopy like his nose. Everything felt all mixed up. Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Charlie felt his shoulders swell up around him, wobbling as they grew. Beneath him, his crotch was tenting and splitting his pants apart. His feet were quickly becoming dexterous hands. With a thump, Charlie fell backwards before his former legs lifted him onto his former hands…now nothing more than cute little footpaws.<br />
<br />
He dangled between two furry legs that had been his arms. Far above him, he could see a head forming out of his cock. As the decidedly skunkish muzzle formed from the cockhead, Charlie finally realized what was happening. He was inverting!<br />
<br />
Prince Gregory walked over to Charlie on his hind legs. Charlie blinked, staring at the crotch of some kind of ferret. Gregory’s face was completely disfigured, A tail and a pucker where his forehead and nose should be. The reddened head of his...tongue wobbled erect from his sheathe-like mouth, two thick balls jostling where his lower jaw should be. <br />
<br />
Gregory’s tongue jiggled and bounced, glistening as a slit opened on the tip. Charlie’s mouth throbbed at the sight of the tongue. For some reason, he was feeling oddly empty. An inverted paw descended from above Gregory and it touched the tip of his tongue. The tongue flared and twitched violently, thick gobs of an off-white fluid splattering warmly on Charlie’s face.<br />
<br />
Charlie watched in horror as the last of Gregory’s head was absorbed into the crotch of the new, twinkish ferret. The cock head at the top of the body opened its eyes and sighed, caressing it’s length happily. Crack and crunches punctuated the air as the cockhead became a furry ferret’s boyish face.<br />
<br />
With a low slurping sound, Charlie felt his own head being sucked up between the globular asscheeks his shoulders had transformed into. The anatomy of his face shifted, his nose-cock and balls swapping with his mouth-anus. Nothing made sense, everything was upside down and wrong.<br />
<br />
He could see the others milling around, no longer taking the goods from the shelves, but playing with their genitals. Hagerd was now a twinky otter. Gregory had become a ferret, Charlie was sure he was becoming a skunk, and in the far corner was a rather plump chicken where the kobold had once been.<br />
<br />
“Sorry for the confusion, boys.” Geoffrey’s new voice came from the doorway.<br />
<br />
With bleary eyes that desperately wanted to close, Charlie stared as the skunk walked in, grinning. He set down an empty jar onto the counter. Charlie’s heart sank. He hadn’t! The stupid bear had chugged the entire jar. And now, Nicolas was fully in charge.<br />
<br />
“We won’t be packing up my shop. In fact, we’ll be staying here. Permanently.” Nicolas smiled.<br />
<br />
Charlie tried to protest, but only managed to blew a raspberry through his puckered mouth. His tongue had settled on the floor of his new anus-tube and throbbed pleasantly. The skunk turned to Charlie and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes.” The skunk conjured a mirror. “I think you look better this way, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Charlie stared. <br />
<br />
Where his face had been was a pink puckered anus. It was impossible of course. Curiously, he clenched a few times, making his pink rim wink and relax in the reflection. That-that was impossible! But he couldn’t deny how different he felt. He was completely suspended in place, subject to the pressure shifting around the outside of his body, now just a single ring of muscle and flesh. Just another part of a very cute skunk boi’s body.<br />
<br />
Nicolas licked his finger and brushed it across Charlie’s body. It rubbed over ever wrinkle and crevice, curling itself into a hook and stroking the flesh tenderly. Charlie’s pucker winked and spasmed involuntarily at the pleasant touch. He could feel his ring plump and throb with delight, the pink flushing into a light red under that gentle caress.<br />
<br />
He was an asshole.<br />
<br />
It was undeniable now.<br />
<br />
And it felt oddly right.<br />
<br />
Charlie lost himself in the sensations as the finger pressed through his tight ring and into the warm heat of his rectum. He squished and yielded like a natural anus, unable to really resist beyond clenching. The little anus was trapped, unable to move as the skunk’s finger sank into his hole up to the knuckle.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and suckled at the finger as it probed him. It bumped his tongue, sending more shivers and tingles through him. The finger bumped it again and again, and Charlie relaxed, letting more and more fingers inside of him. His inner walls massaged those fingers as warmth began to build deep inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t that feel good?” Nicolas asked, continuing to massage Charlie’s prostate.<br />
<br />
“Yes daddy,” A voice above Charlie said.<br />
<br />
Worry passed fleetingly through what little remained of Charlie’s mind. He felt so good, so stretched and full. A small fart escaped Charlie’s loosened lips. Nicolas waved a paw in front of his face and giggled, continuing to work his fingers in and out of Charlie’s wrinkled hole. Then the fingers pulled out.<br />
<br />
He could feel the mephit’s hot breath washing over his rim before a firm, wet tongue brushed over his  form. The sensation of being lapped was multiplied a hundredfold because all his sense and nerves were clustered in just one area. Charlie had no choice but to focus on it, the twinky skunk’s asshole was his whole world now.<br />
<br />
Nicolas’ cold snout pressed wetly against his pucker. His hot, wet tongue assaulted Charlie’s entire body. There was no mercy as the mephit snorted and ground his tongue deep inside of him, cleaning out every nook and cranny of his insides. Drool slathered him, Charlie’s world a mess of squelching and pleasure, making him quiver in delight. <br />
<br />
The skunk above him moaned and Charlie flexed and tensed involuntarily. He felt the legs squirm and kick, paws flexing as they wound around Nicolas’ midsection, pulling him deeper. Again, Charlie felt himself clenching on the slimy invader against he will.<br />
<br />
Wait, he wasn’t even in charge?<br />
<br />
The tongue curled, rubbing his prostate and sending explosions of pleasure through his mind.<br />
<br />
Oh!<br />
<br />
Nicolas continued to probe his body, tongue pressing and shifting his flesh. Charlie felt himself relax, opening up and stretching pleasantly around that tongue. The texture of it plowing through his ring was too much, his mind blanking with delight. But all he could do was twitch and clench, sometimes not even voluntarily. He felt the twink press his rump back into Nicolas’ maw, clearly oblivious to Charlie’s presence.<br />
<br />
With a final curl that made Charlie scream in silent pleasure, the tongue withdrew.<br />
<br />
Cold air assaulted him, the wet saliva slathered on his wrinkled form quickly cooling. Then a burning hot tip of what had to be a cock throbbed warmly between the twink’s cheeks. Charlie could feel it probe him, his muscles involuntarily opening, though it merely circled his rim. The broad tip covered his pucker as it lined itself up.<br />
<br />
Charlie tried to brace himself, but there was nothing to brace against as it ruthlessly plunged forward in a single, powerful motion, spreading him wide open as his flesh yielded. His entire body felt like it had caved in and then squelched apart, stretching him oh-so-wonderfully, lighting every nerve on fire. The cock sank in to the senseless abyss far below his entrance.<br />
<br />
Above him, the twink groaned.<br />
<br />
The cock bottomed out, Nicolas’ sack slapping the twink’s ass wetly. Then he pulled out, before thrusting back in again.  Again and again, the skunk dom drove his cock into Charlie’s opening. More moans came from both parties as Charlie was stretched over and over again.<br />
<br />
For Charlie, the cock was his everything now. His whole body burned and ached so nicely from it. Charlie found himself gripping and squeezing that fat cock as it pumped in and out of his former mouth. The stimulation was overwhelming. Minutes of pure bliss went by, his body rocked and jostled by the big skunk dick.<br />
<br />
Then, with a thrust, Charlie felt the cock plunge deep inside of him. Nicolas grunted and his cock pulses and flexed wildly. Charlie gripped it, massaged the load deeper inside him as hot thick cum shot from the tip. He could feel each shot of cum trickle far back inside of him.<br />
<br />
His twink came too, and this time his mind was truly blown. As the skunk climaxed, his body spasmed. Each pulse of the twink’s orgasm had him contracting rhythmically. He clenched and squeezed and couldn’t think of anything else but the pleasure and the fullness.<br />
<br />
Then Nicolas pulled out with a soft squelch, hot cum trailing off the tip of his dick to where it oozed from the center of Charlie’s wrinkled form. His body naturally closed, but the twink clenched him shut even tighter, clearly intent on leaving the load inside of him. Still, Charlie drooled cum, barely able to keep a coherent thought in his mind after the full-bodied fucking.<br />
<br />
If that had been it, Charlie would have been satisfied. <br />
<br />
But then he felt fingers enter him, new ones, and he was stretched open and fucked. His mind grew blurry from all the stimulation. He could no longer keep track of what was happening. When the lutrine cock had finished, he’d barely recovered, only for a different cock to take his place. He was rimmed, fingered, spread, stretched over cocks and dildos and anal beads. <br />
<br />
It all blended together in a long line of an endless, pleasurable session.<br />
<br />
There was very little of Charlie that wanted to go back to being a wolf after it. But finally, the orgy (had to have been) was over. He could feel the twinky skunk’s legs shifting and stretching around him. The tail that had been hitched up to allow his partners better access was lowered. Cool air against his pucker vanished, replaced with a pleasant and oddly familiar warmth and he was covered.<br />
<br />
The skunk stood and walked towards something. Pressure increased and he was jostled some more. He felt the mephit roll into bed, the pressure released, and the weight lifting. The blankets covered him and he was in the dark. Trapped in a crevice between two perky cheeks. Just a normal-if a bit stretched and leaky-asshole.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-===-==-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Hours went by for the former wolf throbbing under the skunk’s tail. <br />
<br />
Nicolas was spooning their body, his cock pulsing just at Charlie’s entrance. His mind was tired and his new body even more so. He was a virgin and that quick round of stretching had only delayed the onset of some serious soreness. The pucker quivered as Nicolas prodded him gently in his sleep. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t so bad, Charlie thought. Being stretched and full was great and he got to experience the orgasms his body had too. Why he was still conscious was something of a mystery to him, but it was likely that Nicolas wanted to dominate two people at once.<br />
<br />
The sun began to rise and Charlie’s thoughts stuttered. Wait, how many hours had passed without him noticing? What had he been doing? All thoughts ceased as the cock plunged into his still-loose pucker and the skunk fucked Charlie’s body again. The twinky skunk stirred but didn’t wake up as he was fucked.<br />
<br />
Then Nicolas grunted and came before pulling out, semen oozing from Charlie’s mouth.<br />
<br />
The skunk left and made breakfast. It was mid-morning by the time the twink began to stir and get out of bed. Wobbling to his feet, the skunk stretched, clenching his cheeks as he did. As the twink moved, Charlie could feel every step and motion. The pressure squeezed down while he was smothered by that luscious rump and fluffy tail.<br />
<br />
There were brief sensations of cool air against his pucker between steps, especially when the twink crouched down to pick up some undergarments. Then the outside world was quickly cut off as the underwear slid over the wobbly tush and the fluffy tail was pulled through a specially-made hole. He was hidden away, but he could still see some light through the fabric. That was quickly corrected as heavier trousers were pulled firmly into place and buttoned over the tail.<br />
<br />
More semen oozed form Charlie’s mouth as the skunk wobbled into the kitchen, though thanks to modesty, no one would ever know he was carrying a creamy load.<br />
<br />
He heard the sound of water running and the skunk gulping it thirstily, one paw gently rubbing his tender butthole. <br />
<br />
The rest of the morning was as boring as it was confusing.  Charlie’s new vantage point was rather limited – he could hear his new host talking to Geoffrey, though from the conversation it was obvious that Geoffrey had been completely displaced by Nicholas the skunk. <br />
<br />
But other than eavesdropping on his host’s conversations, the only other information Charlie could glean was the feeling of asscheeks rubbing against each other as his host walked, or pressure from above as his host sat down.<br />
<br />
Charlie had almost grown bored of his new existence when light suddenly flooded his vision.  As his skunk host dropped his pants, Charlie was forced to stare out from between two black furred buttcheeks, his vision centered on the toilet that was rushing up to meet him as his host sat down.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Charlie realized.  He had been turned into an asshole.  And assholes weren’t just used for fucking, they had another purpose, and his host was about to use him for precisely that.<br />
He wanted to scream as his mouth began to water, a horrid taste and foul air rushing out of his pucker.  His body began to flex and relax automatically, and all the former wolf could do was wait in disgust as the skunk did his morning duty. A solid mass rushed up his throat and-<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“Pause,” Finn’s deep, booming voice echoed through the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The red dragon materialized in front of the toilet just before something began to press out of Charlie’s orifice. He stood in front of the skunk, who appeared to be just as frozen as the rest of the world. Charlie guessed he was the only one aware of the dragon’s presence.<br />
<br />
“Well, you guys sure have fucked up.” Finn said, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
At last! Finn was coming to undo the timeline! He was saved!<br />
<br />
The dragon snapped his fingers and the skunk stood up. Pleasant ripples of energy radiated throughout the skunk’s body as he grew taller, fur receding, growing into dark wolf fur. The muzzle stretched longer as muscles filled out the skunk&#39;s body. Soon, a handsome anthro wolf stood where the skunk boi had been moments ago.<br />
<br />
As the new wolf stretched, Charlie could do nothing but sit between its furry buttcheeks. As the wolf adjusted his stance and fondled himself, Charlie tried to call out to the dragon but only a puff of foul air escaped his lips, causing the wolf to bashfully look askance at the dragon. His fluffy tail tucked itself over Charlie’s face.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Finn.”<br />
<br />
“No, it’s fine.” Finn chuckled, waving a claw in front of his nose. “At least you aren’t a skunk anymore.”<br />
<br />
No! Charlie protested. He turned me into an asshole, not just a skunk, weren’t you watching?! But no matter how much he wanted to yell, no matter how much he wanted to call out to Finn, his new body wouldn’t respond.  He couldn’t even manage a fart.<br />
<br />
Time began to move backwards. Soon, he found himself covered up by undergarments and leathers, nestled comfortably between a dark-furred wolf’s buttcheeks. It was pleasant and warm.<br />
<br />
Then he felt a jolt of lightning race through his mind, and a picture of a character sheet appeared in the otherwise black confines of the wolf’s pants.  Charlie felt his rectum sink.  In the top left corner of the character sheet was the image of a black wolf, bent over and tailed raised, clawed hands spreading his cheeks wide, proudly displaying his small pink anus to anyone who would see.  And as soon as Charlie saw that picture, he knew that it was a picture of him, of his new, quite possibly permanent, body.  It was a picture of Charlie the asshole.<br />
<br />
The rest of the character sheet was exactly what Charlie would expect given his new form, with a rather plain description of “The tight, well used asshole of an anthro wolf assassin.”<br />
<br />
That was it.  Charlie didn’t want to accept it, but he knew that short sentence was going to describe the rest of his life.  Then, as quickly as the character sheet appeared, it vanished into nothingness, leaving Charlie the asshole trapped in the dark confines of his own pants.  Unable to move or call for help.  Trapped until his doppelganger host had decided to drop his pants.  The asshole mentally shuddered, because he knew there were only two reasons that would happen, and he wasn’t looking forward to either of them.<br />
<br />
=-=-==--=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Charlie the wolf assassin waited outside the perfume shop for Geoffrey to give them an all-clear.<br />
<br />
His tail-hole suddenly twitched and spasmed, making the wolf jump a bit. Then the muscles seemed to relax. Charlie adjusted himself, hiking up his pants and shifting his tail, wondering what that was all about.<br />
<br />
The skunk suddenly came out of the shop carrying a crate of potions.<br />
<br />
“Here, take these.” Geoffrey huffed. “Heavy! Don’t drop it.”<br />
<br />
“What are these?” Hagerd asked, easily lifting the box out of the skunk’s paws.<br />
<br />
“Potions. Hold on.” The skunk went to the back. The sound of clinking glasses came from the back of the shop as the skunk came back out, piling up crates of perfumes. “These are magical too.”<br />
<br />
“Why can’t we go in?” Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
“Like I said, this place is trapped.” Geoffrey sighed. “You know, for a minute there, I almost let you guys come in and get caught.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa.” Charlie said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’d just be a happy little tail-hole for Nicolas to fuck.” Geoffrey paused, “Anyways, I...decided I couldn’t handle him. So.”<br />
<br />
“Well...thank you for not turning me into an asshole.” Charlie said, reaching back and running a finger over the fabric where his pucker was. It throbbed at his touch. Weird. “Anyways, are you okay with being the skunk for tonight’s session?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” The skunk’s eyes glinted, “As long as you’re okay with being my little puppy boi.”<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled, tail wagging. “Claim my ass, skunk daddy!”<br />
<br />
The skunk grinned and they got back to unloading the item</p>
