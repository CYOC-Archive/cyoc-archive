<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fred Simpson was a 17 year old teenage student at the Wilson Honor High School, he was one of the honor students and a member of the student council. Yet despite all of his achievements at school, he wasn&#39;t like some one the guys who didn&#39;t had the appearance much older, taller or even having a muscular body. He was easily pick on by Jason Butcher, team captain of the football player team, due to his rather young appearance like he was from the first grade from middle school, and also for obvious reason Jason just like to bring down the weak lower to despair just for fun. Yet even all the shit he get from Jason, he still was able to have a good, normal life and he would be happy for it to be remain like that, but that all end just last year. <br />
<br />
It was around the previous year that the event that would be know as &quot;Great Change&quot; began, it spread a virus, affect only the tenth percent of humanity population and turned them into &quot;Changeling&quot;. On the first month since the event happen, chaos and mayhem began starting in either small countries or even bigger once, like in China, England, Russia and U.N.A; the governments around the world began gathering and capturing the dangerous once that were either doing crimes or hurting people with their powers. Soon, scientist and researchers began studding the reason of the &quot;Great Change&quot; and if there was a cure, while the governments began making Changeling to registers in the their new system to keep a eye on them, exchange for their freedom and to be treated as like any normal people. <br />
<br />
While this was a major impact for people who have the ability to change form, most people had soon quickly adapted to their situation and used their powers for something useful for mankind, like bring out new kind of entrainments such as movie, shows and even models (ugly women or even dudes becoming sexy female models). Then are some Changeling that were hand-pick and selected by the governments to be part of a new special elite Changeling with the sole purpose of either gathering information, infiltrate or even assassination. Despite how most Changeling seen this power as a gift, not all would agree to their point of view, even me. Some would be pick on by simply being different, being call a freak, forcing them to change for people own entrainment or even being ostracized by society. What more, there are some who would even used their powers for greater harm, such as the Type Three, which could grow limbs or change in size to fight off a group of unarmed people, absorb mass of liquid, or even living being as food (cannot absorb humans or even bigger beings). The governments were able to create towers  known as &quot;Anti-Form Wave&quot; or &quot;AFW Towers&quot; to find and locate any Changeling that did try to hide or refuse to register.<br />
<br />
However, the governments has hidden a secret that they dare not even show to public eye; among this Changeling, there is in fact another group of Changeling known as &quot;Type Four&quot; and they are only the tenth-percent&#39;s of them in the Changeling population. Unlike the three Type&#39;s, they cannot change or transform at all, which make it impossibly hard for the governments or anyone to find these Type Four&#39;s among the normal humans. However, they only have the abilities of absorption like the Type Three, but what is different is that they can absorb living human, or more precise the other three types. By absorbing one of these type, they can gain the abilities of those they absorb, but by doing, even absorbing one normal person, can result an unpredictable change within the person mind, causing them to be unstable and dangerous. Not only will they gain all three Type&#39;s abilities, they can also grow limbs that aren&#39;t human origin, such as horns, claws, tail, even things that aren&#39;t even organic (metal blades, body armor, slime, etc.).  What more, by absorbing more humans or other Type&#39;s, the Type Four more in power and became far more dangerous, to a point at one time ( secretly hidden from the public eyes) a single Type Four had destroy an entire small country by turning into a monster like from a cliché movie (Godzilla).<br />
<br />
The world government have tried and capture this dangerous Type Four, but had been forces to kill them when the situation became unmanageable or far to risking to capture the target. As such, they try as hard as they can to find any suspicious or hidden Type Four that may either being hiding somewhere unknown, even be pretending to another Type or a regular person. As such in this story, there was in fact a Type Four hiding with a high school and it is none other than Fred himself. But as if by god mercy, Fred was able to not only hide the fact he was a Type Four from both the government, students and even his parents, but also was able to lie that he was just a regular human teen and fit in with the crowd. Fred had seen how people would react to a Changeling, such as one of the student girl who was able to change her hair color, a football player trying grow more muscle, or even a sexy, female substitute teacher was in fact a fat, bald dude. Because of some these incidents, some students began hunting down and bothering any Changeling that were already register, especially Jason.<br />
<br />
But that hasn&#39;t been the biggest issue for Fred; for nearly year Fred was able to relax and enjoy his days, but lately he began to feel an unusually and odd urge in his body, like an strong craving for food. He thought it was just hunger, but in truth it wasn&#39;t like any hunger he ever felt; he kept eating food and yet his body still craves for something and always makes him feel in agony. It gotten worse each time the months had pass by, and then one day he heard a &quot;voice&quot; calling to him in his dream. It started out as a whisper, but then it began to grow louder and somehow terrifying, he could even hear the voice during the day whenever he was around a large crowd the people. It kept saying the same word over and over again... &quot;I-Need-To-Grow!&quot; Fred could feel his body and mind reaching it limits, he need to do something with his unnatural craving, but how?</p>
