<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After cumming 3 times, Park sent little Patrick home with a belly full of jizz.  On his way to the bathroom, Park stopped in front of his 8 foot tall full length mirror to admire his new body.  He loved being so tall, hung and muscular, and wanted to go out to see how he compared to other men in this new reality.  After showering and he put on jeans and a tee shirt that were snug enough to leave little to the imagination and headed to his favorite nightclub. <br />
<br />
Walking up to the club, Park noticed how small the non-Asian men looked as they stepped aside to let him go to the front of the line.  The Bouncer,  a huge Korean man, pulled back the rope as he nodded to Park and let him enter.  Inside the club,  the reality of how comparatively small non-Asian men were became more apparent.  Park noted that most of the white, black and Hispanic men were between 5&#39;4&quot; and 5&#39;8&quot; and none were taller than 6 feet. There were a couple of south Asian men there that were over 6 feet tall, but East and Southeast Asian men were huge in comparison to all others.  The East and Southeast Asian men were all dressed in tight clothing that showed of their huge muscles and packages, and none were under 6&#39;6.&quot;  The small non-Asian men were mostly shirtless, and it was clear that in this reality their ideal body was thin and taut exaggerating further the size difference between them and the big Asian men.   Park watched as the small men flirted with and danced for the superior big Asian studs.<br />
<br />
Even among the Asian men, Park felt big. At 7&#39;2&quot; and 340 lbs he was taller and bigger than the men he passed.  As he made his way around the club, Park felt the stares, and sometimes hands, of the smaller Asian men on his body.  Then, near the dance floor, he saw where he belonged.  The Korean men seemed to have all congregated and Park recognized several guys from the gym who had been big before his changes, but now were simply massive.  The Korean guys were all over 7 feet tall and had huge hulking muscles, but one man stood out. Park&#39;s edits to the book had made Mark Lee an absolute titan.  Mark now stood 7&#39;8&#39;&#39; tall. The tight tank top he wore showed his enormous muscles and Park estimated that Mark had to weigh over 400 lbs. <br />
<br />
Park watched as Mark moved around the club. Standing two feet taller and weighing nearly 4 times more than the small non-Asians, Mark was truly breathtaking and Park wanted him. After some flirting and a couple of drinks, Mark and Park ended up at Park&#39;s house.  Mark bent down to kiss Park as he shoved his big hand down the back of Park&#39;s jeans to grope his tight ass. Park quickly became aroused feeling Mark&#39;s huge body pushed up next to his and buried his face in Mark&#39;s deep armpit before taking off of Mark&#39;s tank top to reveal his incredible body.  Park almost squealed with delight as Mark&#39;s 19 inch dick sprung free.  As Mark laid back on the bed, Park rode his huge dick while leaking precum on Mark&#39;s 8 pack from his own 17.5 inch dick.  Through many positions and over the course of a couple of hours, both huge men came several times before falling asleep in each other&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Park and Mark were showering together.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You are just so huge,&quot; Park said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe how small I feel next to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark grinned, &quot;You like it, don&#39;t you little man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Park replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am getting bigger too, I am over 420 pounds now.&quot; Mark continued.  &quot;I just wish I could be taller, but I&#39;m probably done growing at 24.  My younger brother is 2 inches taller than me and I think John is still growing. That asshole is 450 lbs and has a bigger dick.  He walks around our apartment naked and makes me feel small everyday. He likes to remind me he is bigger than me in every way every chance he gets. Like purposefully trying to put on my size 26 sneakers and complaining about how tight they are. He even bullies my boyfriends and says &#39;it is too bad I am not gay, I could show you what a real man feels like.&#39;  It is embarrassing to be so much smaller than your little brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How big would you like to be?&quot; Park asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over 8 feet would be awesome, like 8&#39;2&quot; or 8&quot;3 and over 500 lbs with huge ass feet and bigger dick than my brother.&quot; Mark answered as his dick started to inflate. &quot;That would put me in the elite range, even for Korean men.&quot;  <br />
<br />
After another round of incredible sex, Mark left Park&#39;s place.  Park sat alone with his thoughts and took out the book.  He opened it and wrote, &quot;Mark Lee will start a growth spurt now.  Over the next 5 months, he will grow to 8&#39;6&quot; and gain one hundred and 30 pounds. His feet, hands, penis and testicles will grow proportionally larger as he grows.&quot;  Then thinking about being able to keep up with Mark and about John&#39;s bullying, Park added &quot;I will also have a growth spurt, and will continue to grow until I am 1 inch taller and 20 pounds heavier than John Lee.  I will also have bigger feet and a bigger dick than John.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Park closed the book.  Thinking about Mark&#39;s and his own growth about to start, he got so hard that he had to call little Patrick to come over to help.</p>
