<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Per request, from a fellow writer here:  (thank you ALionetti)  from your story <br/>
/interactives/chapter_158973.html</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(George meanwhile looked down at his body, and all that came of this, and thought about what to do next. He looked at himself and then over at the preening, flexing AJ and...)<br />
<br />
<br />
... began to get aroused as he watched AJ&#39;s aging process, touching and feeling his own younger reshaping body as AJ continued flexing what had now become a 50-something body as George&#39;s own body regressed further backward into it&#39;s prior 25-year-old shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, this feels good,&quot; George whispered, rubbing the abdominal bumps and ridges formed on his athletic muscled stomach.  His cock swelled even harder as his age reduced to 20-years-old.  &quot;Do you wanna keep goin&#39;, AJ?  I sure wouldn&#39;t object to losing a couple more of these years if you&#39;re willing.&quot;<br />
<br />
AJ&#39;s new graying salt-and-pepper head quickly nodded in blissful agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must warn you, George,&quot; Madame Illusia stated, smiling at the muscular, handsome dark-haired young man George had become.  &quot;If you continue with much more of this regression, you&#39;re likely to regress to AJ&#39;s youthful age if you don&#39;t stop soon.  I strongly recommend you say &#39;Stop,&#39; before that happens, George.  Otherwise, you and AJ may change places even more completely than I can fix.  In essence, George, you could end up AJ&#39;s age, gaining most, if not all of AJ&#39;s memories and habits rather than your own.  And of course, that&#39;ll mean AJ will gain your own memories as well, George.  And once your minds readjust with each other&#39;s knowledge and intelligence, you&#39;ll both be switched into each other, potentially even adopting one another&#39;s physical form.  Then neither of you can ever switch it back once you&#39;ve completely traded lives.  You&#39;ll become AJ and he becomes you, George.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want that,&quot; AJ shouted, sliding his hand from his now fully erected 50-year-old manhood.  &quot;I wanna keep all my memories, and this new body!  I wouldn&#39;t want to turn into you.  I-I like this new me.  Tell her!  Tell her you want it to stop, George!  You don&#39;t want to become me.  Not if you knew that I--&quot;<br />
<br />
George chuckled, holding up his hand in interruption.  &quot;No, it&#39;s ... it&#39;s fine, Madame Illusia.  He seems like a normal teenager to me.  And to be honest with you both, I wouldn&#39;t mind having the kid&#39;s same body and memories if that&#39;s where this all leads.  Believe me, kid, you&#39;d enjoy the stock piles of money I&#39;ve accumulated from a long life of savings and hard work.  I wanna be the one who gets to play, and to be ... well ... a kid again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s done,&quot; Madame Illusia said, snickering.  Illusia knew exactly what was about to happen to these two.  And with another magnificent hand gesture, Madame Illusia made their irreversible physical switch.  &quot;George, you will now become 13-year-old AJ Olafsson.  And AJ, you will now be 60-year-old George Everett.  The change is now sealed eternal with the Oaths of The Illusia.&quot;<br />
<br />
AJ looked down at his now rapidly aging body, crying out, &quot;But I didn&#39;t want to be him forever!  He&#39;s too--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too late!&quot; George interrupted, giggling happily as his physique quickly regressed a full year younger into it&#39;s pre-20-year-old muscular form.  George&#39;s cock grew painfully stiff as he felt more aroused ... and horny.  &quot;It, oh no it&#39;s ... oh shit!  I didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t know you had foreskin and a pierced boner, dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
AJ chuckled despite what Madame Illusia had said, that he&#39;d be permanently changed into 60-year-old George Everett.  His mind had focused on the number of zero&#39;s that George&#39;s net worth totaled, reviewing the plans George had for the 300-million he had accumulated from his lifetime of savings and hard work.<br />
<br />
But AJ&#39;s own thoughts was still a part of the memory within his own head now, and AJ knew he wasn&#39;t going to just simply donate his monies away like George had planned.<br />
<br />
No, AJ planned to enjoy every friggin&#39; penny of George&#39;s money himself, maybe building a shitload of skateparks across the country, no ... across the entire globe, making millions more for himself, without working at all!<br />
<br />
He could buy up land, and then design exactly how a skate park should be, like he&#39;d always wanted.  Then supervise the building of each one as they went in and it was completed.  He&#39;d just fly around the world, inspecting each one.  And despite his rapidly approaching age to George&#39;s 60-year-old self, he felt healthy and fit enough that he might even still have it in this new &#39;old man&#39; body to have a skate or two himself.  This new body surely felt pretty damn good, AJ giggled, enjoying the much larger stiffened erection he now had despite it&#39;s lack of having foreskin.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d always wondered what it would be like to not have to contend with that over-sensitive sheath of flesh since his foreskin had always given him a state of continuous arousal and dreadfully long-lasting boners.<br />
<br />
The recent Prince Albert piercing certainly didn&#39;t help get him to go limp any quicker.  In fact, it made him get seemingly endless erections, especially when hot-looking guys were skating with or anywhere around him.<br />
<br />
And that look on George&#39;s rounding, younger face certainly said he&#39;d suddenly realized AJ&#39;s homosexuality!<br />
<br />
George couldn&#39;t help but feel dreadfully aroused.  His hard cock was now sheathed with a foreskin tube that felt so friggin&#39; sensitive and pleasurable it seemed to give him an even harder stiffy.  He should&#39;ve been surprised from the arousal he felt looking over at AJ, or at the older form of AJ&#39;s body, but that &#39;attraction&#39; he now felt was from AJ&#39;s own sexuality and homosexuality, he now knew.<br />
<br />
George&#39;d gained the same enjoyment from all the thoughts AJ had about sexy hot males.  And as AJ&#39;s same pleasures filled his own new teen brain with AJ&#39;s own personality, George actually liked the new promiscuity and complete eagerness AJ&#39;s teenage libido was creating within his head.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t mind the teen&#39;s experimental homosexual thoughts and promiscuous lifestyle.  It was more alarming, at first, to feel his scalp tingling and growing itchy as every hair on his head lightened and became more like AJ&#39;s light blonde coloring.  But as the same shaggy textures of it replaced his own prior style, George suddenly liked the dirtier, bushier effects it was creating through its mop, despite the overdue wash it now suffered.  AJ didn&#39;t like cleaning or bathing frequently, so George now didn&#39;t either.  The stronger new smells and effects he was now noticing weren&#39;t so bad either, George thought, although the dirtier, short fingernails from AJ&#39;s nail-biting was something he might wanna work on in the near future, given their gnawed grubby appearance.<br />
<br />
George actually chuckled from the sights of his new teenage appendages.  Their light blonde airy dusting of hairs on the flesh of his bared legs and slick arms gave his new body a healthy, attractive young look.  Despite that clearly long overdue cleaning each limb suffered, George simply thought of the acts of any hygiene was far less important now, and he actually liked those peculiar new fragrances and scents AJ&#39;s dirty body produced.  His body was far more fit and agile-feeling now, too, and the now rapidly approaching orgasm level of arousal he felt from the entire sight of this new young, virile skater boy body was sending George&#39;s young libido soaring into eager, willing excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;It look&#39;s like you two are now quite pleased with the other&#39;s life ... and lifestyles,&quot; Madame Illusia smiled, waving her hand in a grand gesture again.  &quot;It&#39;s nearly complete, George.  Just a few minutes more, and all the changes you&#39;ve both received will become your own permanent changes.  You&#39;ll both feel one last little new tweak within your new privates, and, well, that&#39;s all she wrote, boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
George shivered.  He reached down, freed his young uncut pierced fleshtube, and began anxiously stroking, unable to prevent his sudden willing eagerness to jerk himself off.  Within seconds, George moaned in ejaculation.<br />
<br />
AJ shuddered, groaning as the thicker cock in his hand swelled, and then ejaculated.<br />
<br />
The audience cheered as both males climaxed, shouting out their thrill as both jacked-off in front of them, and then watching the two exchange their briefs and clothes and get dressed in each other&#39;s prior clothing.<br />
<br />
It was clearly some trick of lighting, or body-doubles being used they&#39;d all imagined, amazed and entertained by Madame Illusia&#39;s transforming circus acts.  She couldn&#39;t really do something that ... wild, that impossibe, they shouted, cheering crazily.<br />
<br />
But one of the audience members knew this wasn&#39;t an act.  It was REAL!  And seated in the front row, radioing in to his task force waiting just outside the tent--prepared to storm inside to capture this Madame Illusia and her cohort son, Stephan, was ...</p>
