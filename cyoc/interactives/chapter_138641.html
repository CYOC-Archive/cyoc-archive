<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A red ethereal figure looked over two worlds, two timelines, accompanied by a white figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;These two timelines... I&#39;m not sure what could cause such different reactions to such drastic bursts of reality alteration, yet alone why they&#39;d split off into separate universes in the middle of the night,&quot; the white one said.<br />
<br />
The red one shook his head. &quot;You forget the personal differences, one version of the owner seems more confident, and figured out a solution mostly on his own... While the other merely stumbled across it, and yet its perhaps a less drastic solution.&quot;<br />
<br />
The white one shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m not as well versed in such issues; so forgive me if I find the difference in effects of the lingering RDF more intriguing. The latter is creating an area that replicates the gun&#39;s effects, but the former... Its perception filter appear to be deteriorating, people are certainly still rooted in the memories of the new reality, but they&#39;ve begun to question it; not to mention that the magically inclined seem to be absorbing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The red one nodded. &quot;... I suppose I&#39;ve usually been the one left to consider the personal, and to just watch... Would you care to watch, and learn about these things?&quot;<br />
<br />
The white one sighed. &quot;If it is your will.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
A young Dove girl stood staring up at a building she now remembered that just yesterday she had tried to jump from. She felt a tinge of melancholy, but more than anything she felt grateful. Her last moments were a wish that she could still live, to find a place in the world, and she had found a place.<br />
<br />
A wolf who had last night been a cop guarding the school before it was changed was accompanying her, mostly as a chaperone. It fit within both her duties as a maid, and as a police officer. She looked down at the young dove. &quot;You seem quiet now... What are you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dove waved it off. &quot;Just glad to have a new life... I guess I just came back because master Curt asked us to think about our old lives, and since he only asked use to think about it... I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t want to go back. The one thing I want to keep from that life is the desire to live I found at the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf ruffled her hair feathers. &quot;I can&#39;t blame you... It&#39;s probably better that way,&quot; she said, &quot;it makes more sense to leave that choice for us I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dove looked up at the wolf. &quot;What about the school and the other blanks though?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf sighed. &quot;They&#39;re a bit single minded, so I think they&#39;d probably stand stock still for their entire time off if they weren&#39;t given direction... And if he only told them to try, its probably fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dove giggled. &quot;I suppose, I can just imagine them standing there like they simply cannot process the idea of doing anything other than cleaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then noticed a sudden taste in her mouth, it tingled, and it tasted sweet. She brought out a handkerchief and pated around the inside of her mouth. As she pulled it away, it came a way somewhat glittery looking with flecks of light moving through it.<br />
<br />
A sudden feeling came over her as her feather hair felt like it was standing on end, feeling like a part of her was radiating above her. Only for the sudden burst to subside.<br />
<br />
The wolf&#39;s eyes were wide, as she looked at the dove. &quot;... You just... You sprouted a halo!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dove made an excited noise. &quot;That&#39;s amazing! I must be a real angel!&quot; She then tried her best to contain herself. &quot;... But... It happening so suddenly... If others are having these moments...&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll let Jan know to keep an eye out, we don&#39;t want to alarm Curt in the middle of his massage, but if it becomes serious, we should have someone responsible ready.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Alexis the kitsune found herself sat in front of a TV with Naomi the nekomata. She hoped to find something interesting, or at least a thread of interest from her past to latch onto. But she couldn&#39;t really bring herself to care about much of it, nothing really came to mind, given she was effectively told to get away from maid-like thoughts for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;I give up,&quot; she said, &quot;the only thing from my past I can even say I liked was stories about tricksters... and I&#39;m not about to cause trouble for everyone unless Curt explicitly tells us to. He only told us to try, and I can&#39;t do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi giggled. &quot;You seemed to be quite the trickster when you convince everyone that following their libido would be the best idea,&quot; she said, &quot;its not like being a trickster is all about causing trouble, you can help people too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis sighed. &quot;Okay... Maybe... But those opportunities like that aren&#39;t going to show up too often, I can&#39;t use that as my reason to be outside of my maidhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, going by the sprit of what he wanted rather than his word... You&#39;re already becoming your own person compared to some of the others, so really I&#39;d say you&#39;ve fulfilled what he wanted,&quot; Naomi said, &quot;but keep in mind the rest of what he asked... &#39;diverse skills, diverse personalities&#39;... I&#39;d say your magic seems to fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would I even start though,&quot; Alexis said, &quot;I don&#39;t even know where to start...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Start by opening your eyes,&quot; Naomi said.<br />
<br />
With a hint of confusion Alexis heard the sound of finger clicking and a sudden clatter made her snap to attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master Curt, I live to serve you, body and soul,&quot; she said, almost on reflex, sounding like she did a say ago in her monotone voice. She suddenly tensed when she remembered she was supposed to get away from that, and then her ears drooped. She turned to the source of the clicking and saw Jan looking at her with a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing?&quot; Jan said, &quot;you two were just staring at the TV for far too long, and I was afraid you&#39;d stopped breathing, or had stopped thinking... If not for the fact everything not nailed down around you two was floating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis&#39; eyes widened. &quot;I thought I was talking to Naomi the whole time,&quot; she said. She looked around and saw a number of books thrown from the shelves of the guest quarters, and a number of plates and cutlery on the table had suddenly become crooked.<br />
<br />
Every fibre of her body tensed at seeing the mess. &quot;I&#39;m sorry pleaseletmecleanthisupI&#39;materriblemaidwhohasforsakenherduties!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jan held a hand up. &quot;If I let you do that now, what&#39;s to say you&#39;re not going to go into another trance again and just cause more work for yourself? You might get trapped in an endless cycle! If you want to help, try and figure out how to control those powers of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis made a little whimper. &quot;I... Okay... I&#39;m sorry you have to see me starting to relapse like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jan shrugged. &quot;You seem to be doing better than some of the others who seem to just be going through the motions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi suddenly got up and wiped some glowing blood off from where she was biting her lip. &quot;We should... Probably find somewhere quiet in the woods... Half of this might be my fault, since we were both in that telepathic trance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two bowed, and ushered themselves out, leaving Jan to clean up the mess. She sighed as she looked at the mess they&#39;d caused.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was right... Might want to keep an eye on any mythics right now... They might be in trouble,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />

<br />
A white cat girl that was once a boy sat on the edge of the Evenson pool naked, watching a similarly black cat trying to remember how to swim and resisting her instinctual panic. A shark boy had joined the black cat and was helping her by sharing his own knowledge of how to swim. She was torn between jealousy that a boy was spending time with the girl that she had agreed to hang out with, and trying not to get swept up in crushing on how cute the shark boy looked.<br />
<br />
After a while the black cat had managed to get back much of her old muscle memory that had been erased, and found herself flopping down next to her date.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to have interest in him Whitney,&quot; she said, &quot;why don&#39;t you introduce yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney blushed. &quot;I don&#39;t know Noira... I think I want to, but some part of me is fighting it. I&#39;m not even sure which part... I think I&#39;m just not ready to be with a guy yet, the way I want to be with a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two sat there, their touch making them happy for a moment, before Whitney finally spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we really regaining our old selves? Or are we just dolls pretending to be our old selves while being something else?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you do if master Curt told us we didn&#39;t have to follow that last order anymore, but didn&#39;t give any other order?&quot; Noira said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably return to acting as I did before he gave us the order,&quot; Whitney said, &quot;though... I guess I&#39;d still want to find a way to impress you, and try and fulfil this desire for... Its probably rude to say it openly like this, but that might just be my maid instincts talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noira held her tight. &quot;At least that&#39;s one thing you can say is yours... And its nice to know you care.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
The fox girl who&#39;d previously been a well off student who had been shot second by the two rampaging kids found herself staring at a phone. She remembered being popular and important at school, a good student. But she didn&#39;t really feel a pull to it anymore, not now that she was one of master Curt&#39;s maids. She remembered the distain she had for master Curt, him and his whole army of maids; and yet she couldn&#39;t bring herself to hate him.<br />
<br />
… She had nothing left tying her to her old life, even her circle of popularity wasn&#39;t really something she had cared about as anything but a tool before, and now it meant even less.<br />
<br />
She felt a tap on her shoulder, and her head turned in a swift motion that almost startled the green lion that had tried to get her attention. &quot;How may I serve?&quot; she said in reflex.<br />
<br />
Becky the lion was a little taken aback. &quot;Please relax, you&#39;re meant to be taking time off.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl put her phone away and turned her body to face Becky. &quot;Apologies, I am unable to find an appropriate recreational activity to attempt to regain a sense of personal identity as master wishes. It is unfortunate, but the social circles that once occupied my time are no longer appropriate to what I have become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who you have become,&quot; Becky corrected, &quot;you&#39;re still a person, even if you don&#39;t sound like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not understand the difference,&quot; the fox girl said, &quot;I am a maid, and a maid is both what I am and who I am. Even if I attempt to put such things aside, it is still a part of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky rubbed her temples. &quot;Let&#39;s get back on track, you said your old social circles don&#39;t fit the new you? If so, why don&#39;t you hang out with some of the maids who are more laid back? Try to relate to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox girl tilted her head. &quot;Are you implying I should hang out with you instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky sighed. &quot;I guess? Unless you can think of any other maids to hang out with, though I still have some work to do before I can clock out for the night, unlike the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a long pause as the fox girl&#39;s thoughts seemed to tick along inside her head. &quot;It is an acceptable arrangement. However, I would also need a suggestion on what to do for the rest of the afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky shrugged. &quot;You&#39;re part of a high class family right? Have you thought about studying economics or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; She paused, something in her stirring, &quot;... If I was a more grateful child, with a mind to help my family, I would have thought of that sooner. Thank you.&quot; She bowed and turned away.<br />
<br />
Becky mumbled under her breath. &quot;... And they said the ones who&#39;s emotions are being driven by their sex drive were a handful.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
The armadillo reporter talked in the office with her boss at the TV station as opposed to master Curt. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be as bubbly as I normally am, but my other boss... He... Gave me something to think about, such as if I should stay in a position that&#39;s enjoyable for myself and everyone around me, or try and move up in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boss just grunted. &quot;We all have bad days, and times we question what we&#39;re doing. It&#39;s not a problem, and if anything a few of our ratings liked that bit of melancholy, they say it made you look thoughtful,&quot; he said, &quot;if you&#39;re looking for a way up though, we need another reporter to cover the start of the mayor&#39;s re-election campaign in about a month&#39;s time if you&#39;re still interested. For now, focus on your current job, and maybe you&#39;ll have an answer by the time we have you out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reporter smiled. &quot;Thank you sir, I&#39;ll give it my best.&quot;<br />

<br />
Four Kitsunes who had once been homeless or drug dealers sat in a bar drinking. Their uniforms getting them plenty of attention from the men, but in this area most of them knew not to get rowdy with them.<br />
<br />
One of the former homeless, the one with the white tips, spoke first. &quot;So, I assume for master&#39;s sake you two won&#39;t go back to your old ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
The former drug dealers both waved it off. &quot;We wouldn&#39;t even think about it, we have no reason to.&quot; They said in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the first spoke. She returned to sipping her drink when the four of them suddenly got a twinge in their head. &quot;You all felt that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Something started dripping from their nostrils, and with reflex they each slapped a handkerchief to the end of their muzzles, holding it there until they felt it stop. When they pulled it away, they noticed it wasn&#39;t quite blood, more like some shimmering liquid with various colours flowing through it.<br />
<br />
The four suddenly got a text message, and they pulled it out in a synchronized movement; and saw that a special mailing list for mythic maids had been created, and the first message was to keep an eye out for sudden surges of magical energy from them, or unusual substances coming from them, and that the area might be flooded with magical energy since an event last night. The message was signed by Pam, as Skyla and Curt were unavailable.<br />
<br />
The four looked at each other unsure, and continued drinking. It seemed that the one thing from their old lives the four of them found for pleasure was simply drinking. If nothing else, it would help them think of something better to do with their spare time.<br />
<br />

The cat girl who was walking dogs yesterday, as well as a leopard girl who had been jogging around the same time were taking their time off to join some of the others at the gym. Two of those that had been women already that had been working out there yesterday had found themselves now joining  the lioness squad, though the brown bear was instead assigned to Cassidy as some extra body guard muscle along with the former men that were here last.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; the lioness said, &quot;if you two keep this up, we&#39;d probably have to recommend you two to join the squad,&quot; she said to the cat and leopard.<br />
<br />
The cat giggled, &quot;I&#39;m not that good, besides, all I&#39;ve got going for me is agility, I&#39;m not exactly full of muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Leopard turned to her. &quot;Don&#39;t sell yourself short, a fast tackle is going to be just as good as a bigger body. Besides, have you seen how fast or how long you&#39;ve been running that treadmill for?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cat girl looked down, glancing at the dial in front of her and realizing she&#39;d been running at forty miles per hour for over an hour; and slapped the button as the realization caught up to her.<br />
<br />
The lion and leopard laughed, with the cat girl blushing as she sat herself down on the stopped treadmill and panted.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
A boy crept into the girl&#39;s side of the baths at a spa, looking around for valuables, and maybe take a peak at some girls while they bathed. Unfortunately for him, there were no girls in the spa at that time, but right in front of the baths he saw a collection plate filled with gold coins being held up by a tanuki.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t hesitate to run up to it, and grab all the coins and shove them into his bag. He didn&#39;t give a second thought as he turned around to leave before anyone spotted him.<br />
<br />
However, a sudden explosion occurred behind him, and a figure in materialized in the mist, with busty breasts and wide sultry hips. &quot;Oh, goodness me, I suppose I just can&#39;t contain my anger at what you&#39;ve done... Or maybe its the ambient magic flowing everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mist suddenly cleared, and the boy saw that the lady wore a bright red Shinto maiden dress that only came down to her thigh, and her fluffy breasts poured out of the top. A bushy red and black tail poked out the back in a pose that would have been provocative for anyone standing behind her, while her face had a dark stripe of fur across her eyes.<br />
<br />
With a quick lunge she grabbed the boy and sat him down where the statue once sat; and the boy&#39;s body began to stiffen as the woman seemed to throttle him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m sure someone else will come along and do the same to you, and then we can be together as sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
As his struggles died down, he found himself feeling giddy as a plate formed above his head, his arm upstretched in a greeting pose, as his body took on the form of a golden beckoning cat. The tanuki placed a couple of the coins that had been stolen from her in the tray, and kept the rest of what she&#39;d been given for herself. Seeming quite pleased with herself, she pondered what to do with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;... I wonder if I can serve master Curt, make some spare change, and annoy the girl who made me a statue... All at the same time,&quot; the tanuki girl said to herself, &quot;of course, I could become a stripper. It would certainly be fun, being the object of my own affection, and getting paid to do it.&quot; She giggled to herself.<br />
<br />
Left behind, the grinning cat sat, mind going giddy as it realized that it would get to be close to all the girls they every wanted, while getting given gold for it in return. And so the cycle continued.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Curt stretched himself out as he got out of the massage parlour; when suddenly a message beeped on his ray gun. A quick glance at the bar showed the maid counter had ticked up a couple to 249 since he was in there. He opened the message, and read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Mr. Curt Evenson; Master of the Furry Transformation Ray Gun of universe 13435-D,<br />
<br />
An issue has occurred with regards to the overflow of RDF energy in your local area. Unlike the universe yours has split off from, the effects seem to be localized to those sensitive to magic. Primarily this affects mythics and other magic users, including the few D-class deities in your employ known colloquially as &quot;demi-gods&quot;, such as the one created when you attempted to create a C-class deity. The effects seem to overcharge their magical abilities, which can have negative or positive effects, including but not limited to supernatural bodily discharge, and uncontrolled supernatural abilities. As these effects may apply to you as well, this is of imminent importance.<br />
<br />
A secondary effect seems to apply to those affected by supernatural abilities, in that they absorb additional RDF energy to become one of your maids, with exceptions as established with the safety protocols of the ray gun. So far only one has been affected, but that could change. As such, and in compensation for the inconvenience, and the following advice, we will add them to your tally.<br />
<br />
Due to the effects being slow to dissipate or discharge, we do not have an accurate estimate for how long the effects will last. However, we do advise against extreme usage of the ray gun within the affected area at this time, as it may prolong or agitate the lingering energy. Such usages include: rapid usage of the ray gun, usage of splash or wide beam effects, or complicated bodily reconfiguration.<br />
<br />
In addition, the effects that prevent suspicion appear to be weakening globally while the effects persist. We are unable to confirm a cause as of this time, but it may be related to the persona death phenomenon. We will endeavour to verify or dismiss this theory in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, the creators of your Transformation Ray Gun.<br />
<br />
P.S. Due to a mathematical error, the one known as &#39;Silvey&#39; was not initially added to the total. We have fixed this error.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt looked over at the others who had come with him to the massage parlour, and saw Pearl was carrying a few labelled jars of unusual glowing substances, each label had one of their names.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;ve gotten myself into something,&quot; he said as he slipped his shirt back on. He sighed, and tried to think of what to do next.</p>
