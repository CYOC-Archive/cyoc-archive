<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob sighed heavily, leaned back in the patio chair and stared up at the sky. Wishing he could go back to being the boy he used to be, he found himself wanting forget everything that had happened, yet found this difficult due to all the little reminders. He could feel the bra encircling his torso, the way the soft fabric covered the front and underside of his B cup size breasts, as well as the way the garment felt both restrictive, yet comfortable. Every time he moved, he felt the soft, feminine clothes he was wearing brush against his skin, whilst underneath the leggings, the underwear he had on and the fresh panty liner he&#39;d put in a bit ago pressed pleasantly into his vulva, offering a constant reminder that his genitals were now between his legs and the only thing he had out front was a swatch of public hair that was kind of soft.<br />
<br />
Ginger strands of hair sometimes fell into his line of sight and he brushed them back angrily every time they did. The hair tickling the soft skin of his face and ears every time he did this, Jacob fiddled with one of the button holes, it had no buttons, on the flannel shirt he was wearing as his mind began to drift. Unable to forget for the moment that, for the time being, he was stuck in Emily&#39;s body, he found himself thinking of everything that had happened since he had left the house for school and all that had transpired then.<br />
---<br />
<br />
After they had left for school, he and Emily had deviated toward Jacob&#39;s house, hurriedly discussing amongst themselves what to say to Mr and Mrs Smith. Whispering to each other, &quot;If mom ask, we are going over to Jacob&#39;s to get something,&quot; every so often they mounted the front steps of the Smith residence and before Jacob realised what she was doing, he watched as his sister began punching the doorbell.<br />
<br />
When it became clear that no one would answer, Jacob began experiencing a panic attack whilst Emily nervously nibbled on her lip. After a moment, she began hammering on the front door whilst Jacob felt a sinking, foreboding sensation coming over him. After a moment, Emily cursed and snapped, &quot;The little turd. Kaitlyn must have known that we would be over here to confront her, so she snuck out early,&quot; as she alternated between pushing the doorbell and beating on the door.<br />
<br />
Jacob found it odd that neither Mr or Mrs Smith answered, nor Ashley and about to point this out, he never got a chance as his sister whipped around to face him. Stating, &quot;You&#39;ll have to confront her at school. Do it between classes. Hell, do it in the couple classes you and I attend at the same time. Anything to get her to see that you cannot be me, I cannot be her and she cannot be you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Completely overwhelmed by this, Jacob had no chance to reply as she turned, she stormed back down the walk and started heading in the direction of the junior high.<br />
<br />
Alone on the porch, Jacob wanted to call out to Emily, to tell her not to go, to say they should sneak off somewhere and to either search for Kaitlyn together or wait out the day we each other. Hugging himself, shifting the pack he had on, he gazed down at himself and sighed heavily. Terrified what spending a day as Emily might entail, fearful that he might lose more of himself, Jacob trudged back the way he&#39;d come, took one look at Emily and Kaitlyn&#39;s house, thought about fleeing up to his room to hide and instead began to short walk to school. Thinking as he did, he wondered what class Emily had first, as they only had three of the same classes together and two of them were on rotating days.<br />
<br />
When he arrived at school, he shrugged off his pack and under the pretense of looking for something, he dropped it on one of the tables outside the high school and began going through it. Finding Emily&#39;s itinerary, Jacob scanned it and learned that she had history first period and Math final period. Seeing that she had PE before lunch, he groaned and put the schedule back in the trapper keeper. Slipping the binder back into his pack, he searched for other information  that would be helpful, found a couple take-home assignments that were due, which he noted Emily had completed some time before her date, her locker location and the combination, as well as a couple flyers for some after school events he figured she must be interested in. Noting that none of them were scheduled for the current day, he breathed a sigh of relief, repacked everything back into the school bag and headed inside.<br />
<br />
Quickly, he located Emily&#39;s locker, dumped what he didn&#39;t need, took what he felt was important and headed for history. There, he was confronted by Madison Davis, who made a spectacle of herself making motions for him. Nodding, he made his way over to Emily&#39;s friend and took a seat. And before he could say anything, Madison gushed, &quot;Oh my gawd. Is it true. All the boys are talking about it. So, it might be true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, Jacob found himself disliking Madison even more. But, knowing that she was Emily&#39;s best friend, he idly took out the appropriate notebook and opened it. As he did this, he painted a look on his face he hoped conveyed he didn&#39;t understand and asked, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Madison flushed. &quot;No need to play coy. Michael is saying you practically invited him to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly remembering the kiss from last night and how much it had made him feel, Jacob shifted uneasily about. Trying to figure out what to say, he listened as Madison exclaimed, &quot;Oh, my, gawd. You did,&quot; pause, then say in a faltering voice, &quot;You didn&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
His patience with the girl slipping, Jacob gritted his teeth, took a deep breath and what he hoped was a steady tone, explained, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about,&quot; as he fidgeted with Emily&#39;s pencils, picked one up, then began tracing various shapes on the lined paper, glancing over at Madison every so often.<br />
<br />
Madison, a troubled look on her face, muttered, &quot;Maybe, you know, never mind,&quot; then, as if she was finally making up her mind what to say, she gushed, &quot;Michael Jones is gloating to all his friends you allowed him to a cop a feel. That it was your idea. That you begged him, like a dog in heat. And that, as soon as the two of you go out on your next date, you promised to allow him to get to third base.&quot;<br />
<br />
His world suddenly starting to spin, then plummet, Jacob whispered, &quot;That dirty,&quot; but didn&#39;t get to finish as the bell rang and the history teacher told the class to settle down.<br />
<br />
After class, glad it was Emily&#39;s free period, Jacob grabbed his notebooks, pencils and what-not. Without giving Madison a chance to say anything, he stormed out of class. Knowing where Michael usually hung out, having seen the jock around a number of times, Jacob made his way to each area. When he finally found the boy, who was surrounded by his friends, he didn&#39;t even stop to think as he dropped everything he was holding and screamed, &quot;You arrogant piss-head. What&#39;s the big idea telling people you and I are planning to make out? That I allowed, begged, you to feel me up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, calm down, baby doll,&quot; Michael said with an easy smile as one of his friends laughed and said, &quot;No wonder he couldn&#39;t score. She&#39;s on her rag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring the jerk, Jacob crossed his arms defensively and snarled, &quot;Don&#39;t call me that. I asked you last night not to call me those stupid pet names. My name is Emily,&quot; and as a feeling of something shifting inside his mind, though he wasn&#39;t sure what it was, Jacob huffed, &quot;And don&#39;t tell me to calm down. You know perfectly well none of the bullshit you&#39;re spouting happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
The easy smile never leaving him, Michael said, &quot;Come on, baby doll. Just calm down and we can talk about. You know you practically begged me to place my hands on your tits. In fact, you pulled me on to you, with promises of what would come with later dates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob, feeling overly emotional and like he was about to start crying, glared at Michael. After a moment, not caring what Emily had to say about it, his mind flashing to the couple times he&#39;d seen Michael naked in the boy&#39;s locker room, he snapped, &quot;You two-timing, arrogant, piss-headed, jock. The only reason you have to go around telling people that you can score so easy is because you need to make up for the fact the you have the dick of a little boy. In fact, if it were any smaller and it would be considered a clit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael, a stunned look on his face, mumbled something like, &quot;Baby doll,&quot; then started to say something else.<br />
<br />
But, not interested, Jacob sniffed, &quot;Don&#39;t bother calling me, teeny-weeny Jones,&quot; and scooping up the stuff he dropped, he turned, pushed his way through the slight crowd that had gathered and stalked off. Feeling, among other things, flushed, Jacob found himself satisfied by the looks on the faces of Michael&#39;s friends. Not really paying attention to were he was going, he soon found himself in the girl&#39;s bathroom, where everything that that had happened promptly overwhelmed him. Gazing into the mirror, he began to softly cry.</p>
