<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max was a young man who worked in a circus. He had a little pet monkey that he would make dance to a wind-up music box. As he wound that music box the monkey would dance. People would throw change.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for that monkey, Max was a jerk and didn&#39;t treat his pet well. He never fed the monkey very much and would often beat the poor thing. People sometimes witnessed this mistreatment but they would never  complain because Max was a big tough man.<br />
<br />
One day a small boy approached Max and asked him to please be nicer to the sad looking monkey. Max told the boy to get lost which made the boy cry. As the boy walked away he  closed his eyes and made a wish.<br />
<br />
After a group of people finished watching the act, Max took a break for lunch. He ate his sandwich while the hungry monkey looked on. Then the monkey wondered to the music box and picked it up. He turned the handle and music played. Max immediately stood up when he heard the music. He was surprised and looked down at his legs. He didn&#39;t know why he just stood up. The monkey stopped playing and looked at Max. Max sat back down and then the monkey started to play the music box again. Max suddenly stood up again.<br />
<br />
The monkey looked up and kept on playing. Max started to dance. He started to rub his head and do a little jig. Max realized that he was doing the dance that the monkey did when he played the music. The monkey stopped and Max stopped.<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot;, he said. He moved quickly to pull the music box out of the monkey&#39;s hand but the monkey retreated quickly and started playing again. Immediately Max started dancing again. He started jumping and twirling. The monkey squeaked with delight as he saw Max helplessly dancing against his own will. Somehow that music box was making Max dance and the monkey was controlling it.<br />
<br />
People started gathering around. The little boy who Max made cry was in the crowd. He was smiling as he realized that his wish was coming true. The rest of the people must of thought it was some kind of act. <br />
<br />
Max tried to fight it. With all his will he tried to stop dancing. His big muscles bulged and he grimaced with consternation but he couldn&#39;t stop. he leaped and twirled and squatted then jumped up again. He rubbed his tummy then his head. He felt stupid  doing this in front of the crowd but they seemed to be enjoying it. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes the monkey stopped. Max fell to the ground exhausted. Then Max carefully approached his monkey. The monkey backed away slowly with the music box. Max suddenly lunged at the little monkey and smacked him hard. The monkey and the music box flew a few meters away.  <br />
<br />
Then both the monkey and Max ran for that music box. Max was tired from all his dancing and the music box had fallen between the feet of the audience. Get me that music box he screamed to the crowd. The small monkey easily ran through their legs and grabbed the music box.<br />
<br />
Now the monkey started winding that box fast. The monkey was angry and frantic. Max suddenly found himself resuming the dance. But the music now was somehow different. At one point he stopped dancing and faced the audience. The music was continuing and max rubbed his chest through his T-shirt feeling the hairs there the way a monkey would. Then to everyone&#39;s surprise, including Max, he pulled off his shirt. The monkey hooted with delight and Max started dancing again but as he wiggled his hips he kicked off his shoes and started to unzip his pants.<br />
<br />
His trousers came down revealing his muscular hairy legs. The crowd laughed as max showed them his funny poke-a-dot boxers. He continued his dance, now clad only in his underwear. The little boy smiled as he saw Max&#39;s embarrassed expression.  When Max put that underwear on today he was not expecting anyone else to see it. The crowd clapped and laughed. <br />
<br />
Max was sweating buckets and turning quite red. His boxers now were clinging to him and one could see his thick meaty dick moving around easily. Max saw people he knew in the growing crowd. People thought it was a great act and many appreciated such a good looking man so scantily dressed. <br />
<br />
Max was terrified that the monkey might make him take off his boxers.  He could never imagine being naked out in the middle of the busy circus. In front of men, women and children! What would his friends think of him. He saw one of the lady acrobats who he always wanted to have sex with join the crowd. She smiled at him. He was hoping that one day she would see his dick but not like this! <br />
<br />
He planned to kill that monkey as soon as he could. He looked at the monkey who was playing that music with a wicked monkey grin. The little boy understood what was going on and was happy that the monkey was getting even with Max. The monkey stopped for a second and Max charged at him, knocking people out of the way. <br />
<br />
But the monkey was quick and seemed to have expected this. He grabbed the box and quickly started playing. Poor horrified Max stopped in his tracks. To his utter embarrassment, he reached for his boxers. He took one last long look at the crowd of smiling onlookers and bent over and pulled his boxers down. His bent over hairy ass was now facing the group, He stood up stark naked with his hands over his groin in the middle of the crowd.<br />
<br />
The audience gasped and clapped and cheered. The acrobat girl covered her mouth to suppress a giggle. Parents covered their kids&#39; eyes. The little boy who caused all this laughed at poor Max&#39;s embarrassment. He wasn&#39;t use to seeing a grown man naked and it was very interesting to see this man&#39;s big muscles and body hair. Also it was great to see a bully get what he deserved.<br />
<br />
The monkey played on and Max was took his hands off his groin and rubbed his head with one hand and his furry tummy with the other. His big dick swung freely as he danced.  As he spun around he saw everyone&#39;s faces and most were staring right at his big flopping dick!<br />
<br />
Max had never been so humiliated in his life. His friends and strangers were all seeing every part of him. All the time being controlled by that stupid little monkey! When he squatted down before leaping his ass opened obscenely and his balls almost touched the ground. At some points he hopped on one leg with the other raised showing everyone the area under his balls. He was so sweaty and he was sure everyone there could smell his body odour.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I wiped my ass well today&quot;, he thought when he again caught the gaze of that girl he liked.  &quot;Was this ever going to end?&quot; He thought with despair.<br />
He was going to have to start asking for help.</p>
