<br />
Isaac turned to face Ilvir as he broke the tense silence, the black haired paladin doing his best to not show disdain at the words escaping his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wise choice. Let&#39;s move.&quot; The draconic paladin commanded, dagger held tight. With a hesitant nod and silent prayer, Ilver trudged to the dragon&#39;s side. A small smirk grew across Isaac&#39;s draconic maw, the dragonman relishing in the subservience he had instilled within the old paladin. Perhaps, making the man submissive and teaching him his place would prevent any further mishaps.<br />
<br />
Flexing his claws and arms, with an exasperated growl the dragonman motioned for the human to follow him, claws clicking against the stone cold floor as the pair began their trek into the darkness of the cave.<br />
<br />
Golden eyes scanning the jagged stoney caves, the dragonman&#39;s chromatic scales began to shiver as odd vibrations shook the floor, the paladin halting abruptly as the unnatural sound of grinding rocks echoed. Sensing impending danger, his reptilian eyes grew dilated as he took a stance; the rose dagger held tight in one hand as the claws of his other hand flexed madly.<br />
<br />
Their senses agreeing, Ilvir grunted as he extended his hands, palms glowing with a mystical energy that lit up the darkened labyrinth. <br />
<br />
Placing his weight on the balls of his feet, Isaac slid forward apprehensively, golden eyes darting around as the human&#39;s light illuminated the cavern. His jaw opened as it has not been a stone cavern like the ones above, but granite. <br />
<br />
Ilvir grunted, wincing and clenching his teeth his head flooded with momentary pain. The weakened energy caused his spell to flicker, yet it remained alight as the man steadied himself.<br />
<br />
Passing by a mound of granite rocks, Isaac&#39;s head snapped to the pile as it moved, before he gasped with a roar as bursts of pebbles and rocks shot up around him and Ilvir, violet runes forming humanoid shapes as granite rocks attached to the various masses of energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granite elementals!&quot; Isaac rasped with a roar, golden eyes shining as he pulled Ilvir towards his body, the human paladin yelping as the hands of an elemental grasped at the air where he had stood.<br />
<br />
Casting a force bolt spell with a growl, a small dart of light shot from his scaled palms towards the granite being, which promptly shattered into pieces as the magic made impact. Ilvir grunted as he recovered from the forceful grip of Isaac, recovering quickly as a bright light formed outside his palms. Spinning on his heels, the raven haired man grit his teeth as he fired bolts of light at the rising form of another golem, the elemental&#39;s arms blown clean off.<br />
<br />
The granite elemental&#39;s jaw hung open as it helplessly stumbled, it&#39;s misery ended as the white scaled dragon plunged his claws into its chest, the core crushed between his fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have to get moving before we&#39;re overwhelmed.&quot; Isaac called as he turned to Ilvir, the human nodding firmly in response. Dagger twirling in his claws, the dragon&#39;s golden eyes scanned the entirety of the granite cave, widening as various purple crystals revealed themselves among the stalagmites, bathing the paladin pair in their dark radiance.<br />
<br />
Their steps echoed throughout the dimly lit caverns as they trudged on with caution, Ilvir&#39;s hands continuing to glimmer with holy light, staying close to the dragon for protection. As they walked down paths of endless caverns, the crystals of violet began to stab outwards from the granite ground and walls, yet no other elementals formed from them. The dragonman&#39;s silver scales began to grow colder with each crystal they passed, their divine luster growing dull and dim.<br />
<br />
Passing through another cavern, the pair stopped to marvel at the place they had found themselves in. A large circular chamber, a mass of giant, jagged glowing prisms adorning the dome-like ceiling. The ornate architecture was quite a departure from the unnatural, and cavernous paths they had traversed. Far on the other side lay a large pair of stone double doors, runic inscription carved into them.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, the two paladin&#39;s found their gaze fixated on the odd structure at the center of the large circular chamber, the statue of a horned, demonic beast. It stood tall and proud, an axe heaved across muscular shoulders while one hand lay clasped across it&#39;s armored chest, a prism of purple piercing through the back of its hand and revealing itself to the pair. It&#39;s fangs were parted in a psychotic grin, revealing fanged teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;A place of worship?&quot; Ilvir questioned, maroon eyes continuing to examine the walls of the chamber, old eroded depictions stretching across the dome-like walls. His eyes grew clouded as they drifted back to the demon statue, eyes falling to its crotch and equipment it bared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound like a farfetched conclusion...&quot; Isaac murmured, golden gaze following his human companion as he tiredly walked towards the statue. He groaned in annoyance, bringing a claw up to his face as he realized Ilvir had been glancing at the demons loins in a dream-like luster. Sighing his disappointment, the dragon&#39;s claws clicked against the stone floor as he trekked to the human&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
He was nearly thrown off his feet as the entire chamber rumbled, reptilian gaze shooting skyward as the crystal above began to pulsate, steadily losing mass as violet energy formed above the demon statue. With a final pulse, the crystal all but vanished as it became a singular mass of energy, a large hole taking its place in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back!&quot; Isaac roared, his claws grasping for Ilvir as the human stared aimlessly at the purple mass. The dragon&#39;s road became a gasp as his claws smashed against a large barrier, runes of purple growing and blocking him off from the entranced man, who now remained trapped with the swirling mass and demonic statue.<br />
<br />
The draconic paladin&#39;s jaw clenched shut in dread as the violet mass of energy trickled into the demonic statue, what he presumed to be the skin of the statue becoming pure energy and formless, while the black armor adorning it shimmered with a dark luster alongside the monstrous axe. The stone pedestal it stood on crumbled to dust as limbs barely resembling feet met the stone ground, the human below at eye level with its armored chest.<br />
<br />
Stumbling forwards, the demonic elemental&#39;s claws coiled around Ilvir, the black haired man&#39;s eyes widening as he was spun around, snapped free from his trance as he felt something large prod at his hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What in--?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Given no time to charge up a holy spell, or even scream, the paladin&#39;s eyes clenched tightly in pain as the demon&#39;s dick slid into him, moaning pathetically as he began to sink into it&#39;s elemental &#39;skin&#39; as the black armor parted. It&#39;s vaguely humanoid legs gained more definition as solid matter merged with it, claws bursting from Ilvir&#39;s toes as he sank to his waist into the demon, his stomach beginning to bulge as a tentacle of solid light pierced into him without mercy.<br />
<br />
Futilely banging his fists against the magical barrier, Isaac&#39;s breaths grew heavy with the progenitor&#39;s primal rage, golden eyes beginning to shine as the black armor sealed across Ilvir&#39;s bare chest, the human&#39;s cries growing choked as a large maw clamped over his face, the eyes of the elemental demon alighting with a crimson glow as it continued to siphon energy from the human that it had encapsulated. It&#39;s arms burbled with muscle as energy coiled around Ilvir&#39;s own, claws sprouting as his hands were coated.<br />
<br />
The axe in its grip twirled in triumph, shaking the ground as it stabbed the tip of the weapon into the ground. The demon suddenly stumbled however, a muscled arm shooting to its face as it&#39;s mouth suddenly flung open, Ilvir&#39;s own mouth visible from within. Screams for help were silenced as a phallus-like gag formed and plunged into the man&#39;s throat, the elemental&#39;s mouth closing promptly with a satisfied, lust-filled grin. It flexed in admiration of it&#39;s defined muscles, admiring the statue and human it had utilized to create a body for itself.<br />
<br />
With an incomprehensible grunt, the demon&#39;s grin darkened into a distasteful smirk as it locked eyes with the dragon before it, the chromatic scales utterly repulsive. The axe in it&#39;s claws spun, before it lay pointed at the singular claw embedded in the scion&#39;s plated chest, no doubt sensing the old power of the progenitor within.<br />
<br />
Isaac staggered back, a primal growl reverberating from his chest as the barrier dissipated with a burst of energy. <br />
<br />
The demon lunged with an ear-splitting cry, arm pulled back. Stabbing his claws into the stone floor, the dragonman&#39;s muscled arms rose to grab hold of the elemental&#39;s arms as it swung the black axe, pearly white fangs clenched tight; the axe&#39;s blade laying inches away from his neck. Golden eyes widened as Ilvir&#39;s muffled moans caused the demon to momentarily lose strength, the silver dragon taking advantage and throwing it back towards the center of the chamber with an irritated roar.<br />
<br />
The two beasts panted, the demonic elemental struggling to retain it&#39;s dominion over the human within it while the dragon recovered from the overexertion of strength.<br />
<br />
Eyes narrowing to slits, Isaac hissed as he aimed the rose daggers serrated blade towards the demon, the elemental scowling as it mirrored his action by positioning it&#39;s axe, teeth clenched tight to muffle Ilvir&#39;s continuous moans as elemental energy continued to plunge into him.<br />
<br />
Silence graced the chamber, only broken as granite constructs rained from above. The various rocks tumbling around gained humanoid shapes as violet wisps of energies merged with them, granite elementals rising to aid their makeshift leader.<br />
<br />
Despite the seriousness of the situation, Isaac found a grin growing across his draconic maw, tongue sliding across his fangs in a depraved hunger as his prey had revealed themselves to him.</p>
