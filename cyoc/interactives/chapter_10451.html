<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Sally lounge about the swimming pool, wanting to get a tan you lay out on a lounger as Sally sits beneath an umbrella.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want a good tanned look one need only go where James did and ask, you'll have one hell of a permanent tan!&quot; chided Sally. &quot;You do realize there better than a 50/50 chance he won't ever come back!&quot; says Sally as you peek one eye open.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not worried!&quot; you reply with a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worried hell, you don't give a damn for the guy, in fact I suspect you hope he ends up as one of the Doc's test cases, right?&quot; chides Sally again.<br />
<br />
All this while James Farr had reached his goal and was allowed inside Mrs. Latier's home for an interview. He was feeling rather bold as his questions were met with very rational responses. It was after an hour of talk Mrs. Latier offered James a personally conducted tour of the farm buildings and barns.<br />
<br />
James quickly agreed and shouldering his briefcase and camera the two walked out into her private gardens.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Latier explained how some of her trees and plants had feelings and just by standing near to them and talking softly one might actually hear the plant groan a little.  So as James stood near a large spreading Oak tree he knocked with his knuckle on the trees outer bark. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mister tree are we having a nice day?&quot; asked James with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the entire tree from roots to upper limbs did make a rustling shiver. James jumped back as even the ground beneath his feet seemed to move as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You thought I was joking, didn't you young man!&quot; said Mrs. Latier. &quot;Ill show you our most special breeder stock, they would like to see you too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly they walked and talked as Mrs. Latier explained the use of her personal system of effective breeding with horse, cattle, chickens, sheep, goats, and when the order arouse even wild animals as lions, bears, or once an elephant.<br />
<br />
James was fast making notes and took some pictures of the horse paddock and exercise ring made to walk horses in a large circle. Then they got to a large red and white trimmed barn. Mrs. Latier asked he not take any photos inside less he scare the animals.<br />
<br />
Once inside the din of animal noise slowed and calmed till one could hear a pin drop into the straw covered floor. James looked up into the high ceiling taking note of the large hayloft and tons of equipment made to cut, reap, and bring into the barn that which the animals would need for eats.<br />
<br />
Then his eyes panned down the long row of large box stalls. As they walked and talked Mrs. Latier told of each animals ultimate use and how they would be introduced into the common breeding stock of her's or another farm.<br />
<br />
The two of them were almost to the far end of the barn's box stalls, when from the far end came a call for Mrs. Latier to accept a telephone call.<br />
<br />
She told James to stay put and not try to feed the animals less he get bit. A simple nod to agree saw Mrs. Latier scurry off leaving James alone. So peering over the top rail of first one and then another box stall he made notes as to the animals in each.<br />
<br />
James began to wander farther down the isleway till he came near to what looked like oldtime jail celss with black steel bars. The light at this point was very dim and James wishing to see what might be inside grabbed his keychain flashlite.<br />
<br />
The narrow beam of light spotted one dark figure sitting and hunched into a ball sitting in a far corner. James feeling only consideration for the animal spoke in soft words to coax it out of the corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut that fucking light off!&quot; came a sudden and strange response from inside the cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's in there?&quot; asked James.<br />
<br />
The dark figure got to its feet and with a sauntered walk came closer and closer to the steel bars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God in Heaven!&quot; said James being astonished at what he saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd better back away from the cell area lees Mrs. Latier come back and you have a cell of your own!&quot; said the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, your, your......!&quot; said James as his mind said noway and his eyes said it's damn true.<br />
<br />
The face of a human being was sunken into the large skull and thick neck of one large a furry Black Bear. The man's eyes blinked and with James getting used to the dim light by then notice the golden yellow coloring just like a bear might have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you ask I'll tell you that all the animals you've seen in this barn were at one time or another humans. Now though with her special ways and that horrid doctor's serums we will all become animals in body and to a fair degree in mind as well. Yup, drunks, runaways, tresspassers, and those like you who find out too much all end up as fodder for her blandishments. I for one was having financial troubles and was being saught by the law. So being like this doesn't really make me feel all that bad! Well I'd either be in some wrechid prison or having to start all over again after wife and kids all left me to my fate. So when I happened to find refuge one night inside her barn, she offered me a long term employment and a total change of identity. As you can see not even the Police or my wife would ever recognize me now, or when I'm in some zoo, right?&quot; explained the Black Bear of a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;All those, and what is in the other cells?&quot; asked James as  he peered around the corner into yet another dark cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh her, she's a little too willing and has played some awful tricks on two of the farmhands working for the Lady. Michelle is well on her way to become a true female Satyr. Her ultimate form was ordered by some English Lord wishing for some wild sexual hideaway. Anyhow just her look or rather your look into her eyes can make you enter her cell and there after some sexual play I've seen those two farmhands stagger out with shaggy goat hair on their heads and a tail sprouting off their butt. Oh the two of them are back up the isle and have been changed by Doc to complete goats.&quot; explained as he warned James to be careful.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of the other cells, I count tweleve in all!&quot; asked James.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't say for all of them but I watched as a few were walked or dragged down the isleway and tossed into their cell. Just passed Michelle's cell is a guy who was going to made into a type of wild African boar. When he's totally changed they plan to ship off to a game preserve for some big hunt, nice huh!  The one across from me here is Austin, hey Ausie come show yourself off to this cvandid young man.&quot; said the Bear man.<br />
<br />
James turned around to see large yellow eyes come very close to the steel bars. The dim light was still enough for his bright white and very pointed teeth to show quite well.<br />
<br />
&quot;He can't talk anymore but I think as any of us he's got the most interesting form I've seen. He's a giant thunder lizard is what Mrs. Latier has denoted about him. Careful as his mind has almost totally gone over to lizard mentality, he likes meat!&quot; siad the Bearman.<br />
<br />
Then from the far end of the barn came Mrs. latier talking with some farmhand. James wavied to the bear and ran up the isleway to be looking over the one stall's rail at two large male goats trying their best to mount the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interested in something?&quot; asked Mrs. Latier to James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I thought that animals would only try to mate with females, these two are rather mixed up if not gay!&quot; said James.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Latier looked into the box stall as both goats dropped to all fours ans stood motionless looking up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those two, they had a difficult time last week with one female goatess, she about sent them into sexual maddness!&quot; explained Mrs. Latier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa!&quot; went one goat with a short thought to her words.<br />
<br />
A stern look from her to the big buck goat bade her give him a small threat. &quot;You and your buddy will leave soon with Michelle and I bet find your life one of continuous humping and proof of male dominance, if your lucky!&quot; she said almost cursing the two to a life of bestial sex.<br />
<br />
James, his head full of information walked out of the barn with Mrs. Latier. She pointed him toward the main chemical lab and began to explain her special system.<br />
<br />
Listening, James made some notes but didn't want the Lady to think anything suspect about what he might have seen in the big barn. Yet the sight of her Lab was to say the least very interesting. It was when she was talking about how the hide pigment of animals was so important to protect them from the elements James asked a favor.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Latier smiled and agreed in short note. She asked a Tech for a small jar of dark ointment and handed it to James as a free sample.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please take this and give it to your girlfriend, I know the results to be something she will find interesting. The oinment will give her a permanent tan of smmoth colorization she will find as a strange passion and enjoy. Oh but be careful she does not put any on you as the chemical base is gender set and might cause you some side effects.&quot; said Mrs. Latier as the tour ended there and james was escorted back to his blazer for the ride to meet Sally and you.</p>
