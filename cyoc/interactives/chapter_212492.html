<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan watched as the two brothers of Chris returned to the living room area where Lola had settled herself awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I should be going?&quot; suggested Lola the moment that Chris had sat next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about my brother messing things up, ever since preschool... but I&#39;d really like to spend some time with you tonight, even if it&#39;s just actual Netflix without the chill,&quot; said Chris rather endearingly--apparently he had been more sincere when younger Ethan took note of. And that put a thought into his head--how much of what Jerry and Chris were as adults was just the result of poor choices or crappy hands dealt to them that they got stuck with?<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you two were rather adorable as preschoolers--and regular playground terrors, constantly fighting and pulling each other&#39;s hair out,&quot; said Lola.<br />
<br />
&quot;We only went to preschool together for a little bit, but yeah... that pretty much sums it up. What do you want to watch?&quot; asked Chris as he turned on the TV and selected the Netflix app.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t your parents tell you that you had to look out for your baby brother?&quot; asked Lola.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so curious about what happened twenty years ago?&quot; asked Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just trying to understand you and your brother&#39;s relationship--and how it was at the start can really tell you a lot about why things are the way they are, and how to improve things... and besides, I&#39;m a Pediatric Psychologist,&quot; said Lola.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha... why don&#39;t you pick the movie and I&#39;ll go make something to eat or drink... any preference?&quot; asked Chris<br />
<br />
&quot;A vodka soda if you have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure I have the lime for that, but I definitely have the soda and vodka,&quot; said Chris as he rose from the couch.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Lola was right, and getting back to the beginning was a way to improve both Chris and Jerry. Only instead of just making one of them younger, Ethan decided to slowly eat away at all of their ages and take them all back to preschool ages. Ethan decided that the youngest Alyssa and Jerry should get should be 2, but decided that rather than keep the three year age gap and have Chris and Lola be Kindergartners, that they should instead become 3 year olds. The only problem then being that they would need parents to look after and take care of them. Well, the Chronivac had found Chris and turned him from a distant cousin into Jerry&#39;s new father when needed, perhaps the Chronivac would work its magic again to find a similarly distant relatives and alter reality enough to make them the parents to the four soon to be preschoolers.<br />
<br />
Ethan hit in the new target ages for all four of them just as Alyssa and Jerry, who had finished getting dressed came out from their respective hiding spots and joined Lola in the living room. The two unabashedly sitting next to each other in the love seat perpendicular to the couch and unafraid to be as openly affectionate with one another as any college-aged couple looking to weird out their third or fourth wheels so they could be left with the apartment or room to do as they liked. So naturally the hand holding, snuggling, and whispering back and forth to one another turned into small affectionate kisses that were soon going to escalate. Chris meanwhile was finishing making the vodka soda--and had even found he had a lime to put in it and was bringing it back. As he re-entered the living room both of the clothes that he and Lola were wearing shifted from evening clothes to something a little more reflective of comfortable college attire of sweat pants, t-shirts and flip flops as they dropped a few years until they were college seniors and sweethearts sharing an apartment with Chris&#39; younger brother and his girlfriend. Alyssa and Jerry hadn&#39;t lost as much age as Chris and Lola had, only slipping back from being college seniors to juniors, and the new reality where the younger couple were only a year younger than the elder settled in for all four of them. Nothing much changed about their bodies beyond perhaps the four of them being a tad slimmer than they had been a few moments ago, though you really couldn&#39;t tell beneath how poorly they were all dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, boo,&quot; said Lola as she curled up to the now settling in Chris who was being careful to not spill her drink on her before handing it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for you,&quot; said Chris with a smirk and then a full kiss, which only prompted a pillow to be thrown in their direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Save it for your room!&quot; protested Jerry with a laugh that he was soon joined in on by Alyssa as the two of them shrank through their college years to become skinnier as they returned to fresh faced freshman who hadn&#39;t put on the freshman fifteen, yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost spilled my drink!&quot; protested Lola as she rather eagerly downed her vodka soda as she settled in as a sophmore along with Chris before putting down her now empty glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s time for you two kids to let us adults have fun,&quot; suggested the now freshman Chris to the athletically lanky high school senior Jerry who&#39;d lost a lot of his muscles he&#39;d earned as a collegiate, and the day&#39;s old scruff sank into barely visible scruff that just needed to be shaved off until it grew into something substantial. Alyssa&#39;s body began to slim, her breasts becoming perkier while losing their fullness and her face rounded, her nose turning slightly up as her red hair became even brighter. Both of them now dressed in pajama pants and t-shirts of differing colors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s the adults? Just because you&#39;re seniors this year, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re that d--different from us!&quot; protested Jerry as his voice cracked, something that he&#39;d thought he&#39;d been past unless he was getting anxious or upset.<br />
<br />
Chris and Lola now had truly begun to lose their adult bodies as their bodies slimmed down to teenage proportions. Lola&#39;s long brown hair going from just hanging loose to being pulled back into a ponytail. Her sweatpants transforming into a pair of cute pajama pants and matching top, and flip flops transforming into a pair of slippers. Chris&#39; dirty blonde hair grew out slightly from the short fade he&#39;d been keeping it in and it became a shade lighter and closer to the truly blond shade his little brother had, likely from his time spent out in the sun on the track for high school both for Track and Field and Cross Country, his body shifting into the lean athletic build of a runner. His sweatpants shifting into a pair of track pants and an oversized t-shirt, while his flip flops shifted just into socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, who&#39;s the one who can drive here?&quot; asked the now sixteen year old Chris, waving around his car keys that he liked to carry around just because he could now. If he didn&#39;t have to shave, at least he could show how much of a man he was becoming by having his car keys with him everywhere and at all time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you just have a-- learner&#39;s permit,&quot; said the continuously voice cracking Jerry as he retreated further into puberty and started to shrink a bit, his body looking like it less matched the proportions of his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, at least my voice&#39;s s-settled!&quot; said Chris, who blushed at his own voice crack and shrank a bit himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... what movie do we want to watch?&quot; asked Alyssa, trying to pull Jerry back from getting into an argument with Chris--though knowing it was likely futile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno... something good!&quot; said Jerry as he sat down and shrank back to the very beginning of puberty when his voice was still high. By now the dynamics of the night had shifted from two couples to that of two brothers and their crushes taking advantage of their Mom being out of town.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can sit by me, Chris,&quot; offered Lola eagerly. Her transformation through puberty now left her at the beginning, in braces, shorter, and with a much smaller chest that only required a training bra. At thirteen Chris wasn&#39;t much different as his dirty blond hair was now so grown out as to look positively shaggy and they both were just starting to become teenagers and their lanky out of proportions bodies only emphasized this compared to the smaller preteens over on the loveseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... o-okay,&quot; said Chris nervously as his voice cracked back to pre-pubesence and he left puberty behind completely and he sat down next to Lola his classmate who he&#39;d had a crush on and his mom said he could have over for a sleepover--as a friend--if they invited one of Jerry&#39;s girl friends from school. Unlike Jerry, who seemed to draw all the attention of the girls in his grade and know how to talk with them and giggle over him, Chris just felt completely awkward--especially with his braces. But with Lola also having braces, he didn&#39;t feel quite as self-conscious about them as he did around other girls.<br />
<br />
Another shrink spurt brought all of the children&#39;s feet off the floor as they started to dangle as they continued to get younger and shrink. As they were looking through Netflix they began looking for different kids&#39; shows to watch, ignoring the teen fare they had started out perusing at first. Braces vanished and their pajamas all transforming into matching sets of tops and bottoms that most parents would dress their younger children in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna watch the Miraculous Ladybug!&quot; insisted Alyssa, who as she was shrinking back to early elementary school was beginning to become more demanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Paw Patrol!&quot; protested Jerry, who was beginning to reacquire baby fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Paw Patrol!&quot; agreed Chris, who wasn&#39;t that far behind Jerry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, you really should let your guests watch what they want to watch,&quot; called a voice from the kitchen, and all four children turned their heads to see Chris and Jerry&#39;s mother come in with a tray that had cookies and milk. Lola&#39;s glass from earlier having transformed into a glass of milk that she&#39;d drank earlier instead of the vodka soda.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked at the woman who he now saw from all the changed photos around the apartment was clearly Chris and Jerry&#39;s new mother. He pulled up information on her. Apparently she&#39;d been an even more distant relative than Chris had been from Jerry. A successful business woman who&#39;d decided to have children once getting settled in her career and on her own thanks to a sperm sample from a sperm bank, according to what Ethan was reading. Her name was Charlene, and she was a rather pretty mature 30 something looking MILF as far as Ethan was concerned... heck his dick was getting rather hard watching her bend over to place the tray of cookies and milk down on the coffee table before the four newly minted preschoolers who eagerly dug in to the cookies with their chubby little crayon grippers for fingers. As they settled onto the floor, the couch and loveseat now being too high to climb back up with their hands full, the four toddlers settled in at ages two and three, and laid down on the carpet, looking up at the TV in awe and wonder as Charlene turned on some Rugrats for them to watch. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d soon be asleep anyways as it was way past their bedtime, but considering she was looking after Alyssa and Lola for their mothers, her boys had been overly excited to do things and stay up later to play, and she&#39;d let them have fun for tonight, but tomorrow night she&#39;d be strict about getting them back on their schedule... for their own good of course.</p>
