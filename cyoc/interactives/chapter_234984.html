Oh, and don&#39;t worry.  You can expect a happy ending.<br />

<br />
Travis lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, awake 30 minutes before his Monday alarm would go off.  He lay motionless, not a finger on any of his four, six-fingered arms or a toe on his four-toed feet budged.  He was just breathing in, and out.<br />
He first looked down at his ebony brown schlong - the ridiculous, 24-inch thing had escaped through the opening in his boxers, and was standing to complete attention, and throbbing not with need but due to the usual morning wood.  The usual tip of a penis&#39; foreskin was not present on Travis&#39; monster, replaced instead by a fully-functioning, rather plush pair of soft red, female lips - that were at this moment forced open and &quot;drooling&quot; precum thanks to &quot;nocturnal penile tumescence.&quot;  <br />
And that was not the only major female quality Travis had gained from the Fusion Wave - he had strange 1-inch diameter chest nipples - though not breasts themselves, they were probably twice as sensitive as them.  Actual regular female ones had fused with his testicles, and made them both squishy and coconut-sized.  Walking was now a challenging process even with special Mutas Fashium undergarments - so that he wasn&#39;t always squeezing his balls when he walked and causing erections, a cowboy-like walking stance had to be adopted. Though Travis had lost all sense of embarrassment on the subject long ago, the fact that his new anatomy forced his genitalia to always hang free (for comfort and practicality reasons - it couldn&#39;t fit under anything), having a 2-foot boner in public was still uncomfortable for himself and anyone around.<br />
At the very least, the individual hanging &quot;breasticles&quot; were extremely pleasurable (no longer painful when squeezed) - and allowed orgasms to yield a highly nutritious mix of normal seed and milk (not to mention flooding his body with an equal amount of estrogen and testosterone).  <br />
The young man didn&#39;t really mind these feminine touches anymore - the changes to his body&#39;s morphology by the Fusion Wave had, over time, made him practically androgynous. Also, there were plenty of sensual perks: his dick was now more than long enough, kissing (especially French Kissing) those lower lips brought spine-arching bliss.  Keeping his hair short and cropped and maintaining his slim frame at the gym, his face could pass for that of a very feminine guy, though if his hair were long, he wouldn&#39;t even need a touch of makeup to be mistaken as a rather attractive woman - his face, especially his lips, looked like they could easily belong on a tomboy twin sister of his old, normal self.  But being mistaken for a woman wasn&#39;t something he really minded either - he liked shoulder-length haircuts too much, his widened hips gave him a pleasant hourglass body shape, it was sometimes fun just fooling around as the opposite gender, and . . . there were bigger problems in his life.<br />
<br />
Travis sighed, but not for himself, as he looked to his left, and sadly, longingly stared as his wife.  She was the one thing he really did mind - He still loved her greatly.<br />
However, he was unsure if she was even capable of doing so at this point.<br />
<br />
At the moment when the Fusion Wave hit, Travis was kissing his wife, May, on the cheek as she plucked zucchinis from their house&#39;s backyard garden.  When the hot air and quick wall of red energy came painlessly and left as fast as it had arrived, the young man&#39;s attempts at consoling his wife were interrupted by the pain of his new arms growing in, and a spine-arching sense of sexual bliss that permeated his whole body as his penis more than quadrupled in size - causing him to climax at this most inopportune time.<br />
Waking up covered half in dirt, Travis&#39; first thought in his groggy head was not of the tentacle wrapped around his leg, his softer skin, or his extra arms - but of his wife.<br />
<br />
The shock of seeing her in such a form then was as strong as it was every morning.  Potted in rich soil he made sure to water daily, was what had become of May - a &quot;succplant,&quot; with a look and feel seemingly pulled straight from the pages of Rule 34.  Basking in the golden rays of sunshine that radiated her morning sweat and drool with a majestic golden aura, Travis could not deny his wife&#39;s new form&#39;s beauty, but again was forced to reconcile with the fact that she hardly had the intelligence to recognize or converse with him, or even recognize him - she didn&#39;t have any eyes or ears yet.  The charming love of his life had been reduced to an immobile, blind, and deaf half-plant that, solely guided by instinct and a persistently high libido, pursued the sole task of seeking out something to suck on - most preferably a penis.<br />
<br />
What she always in a state of ignorant bliss?  Of silent, dark suffering?  Or was she even capable of feeling emotions anymore?<br />
<br />
2 painful months had gone by before Travis and his wife were finally able to see a WTEA mutant specialist physician - dutiful watering and fertilization, and plentiful exposure the sunlight had kept May&#39;s leaves vibrant and healthy - but her head had gradually become paler.  No amount of food May ate lifted the sickly pallor.<br />
<br />
It so turned out that there was a good chance that May could regain all that she had lost.  As observed with the thousands of Succplant transformees that had forms most similar to May&#39;s around the world, when given sunlight, water and nutrients, they would slowly grow, not just in size, but gaining bodily attributes.  This happened in stages, though the attributes were not gained in fixed orders.  Though this process could stop at a certain stage, there were many transformees who, with the right care, grew back eyes and ears, the ability to speak, human memory and consciousness, and even arms.  Less commonly, some even grew full humanoid bodies.<br />
This of course applied to all transformees who had lost the aforementioned bodily parts and senses upon transformation - not all succplants ended up looking like May did.  And of the transformees who looked like May, only around 75% had successfully gained back 3 attributes or more.<br />
<br />
The doctor reassured Travis after the initial analysis that he was doing everything right - all his wife needed was specific nutrients her transformed body needed to grow - and that came in the form of, specifically, semen - administered orally.<br />
<br />
With testing, it was determined that the contents of Travis&#39; &quot;breasticles&quot; were far more than suiting for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Shocked and appalled, Travis would have started screaming if the physician and the staff at the WTEA clinic were not as patient and kind as they had been.<br />
<br />
Formerly a pharmacist, the WTEA physician had given off a feeling of tranquil patience and understanding, their tired eyes and faces as comforting as their voices.<br />
<br />
An older woman with an attractive build, the physician had trouble standing on two limbs - her feet had been replaced with equally-sized hands.  Thankfully, her arms had lengthened and grown to match the size of her legs - and her original hands had grown to meet her new lower hands&#39; sizes as well. On all fours, the physician&#39;s two heads had gone to work inspecting every inch of Travis&#39; and May&#39;s body, and then entering necessary information into the WTEA database. One head was attached to her now extremely long, opposable neck - the other was attached to an equally long, opposable tail. (Concealed by a lab coat, Travis couldn&#39;t possibly have known that the physician&#39;s three breasts had functioning vaginas instead of nipples, but enough of that now.)<br />
<br />
Travis brushed the hair out of his face and gingerly walked over to his wife.  He closed his eyes and turned his head, not willing to look at either May or his penis.  No matter how necessary it was for her survival and eventual, possible, recuperation, getting a blowjob from his helpless love was nothing to be proud of.  It felt wrong.  More than wrong.  A wrong that couldn&#39;t be described or put in words.<br />
<br />
His heart dripped with shame after every &quot;feeding.&quot;  Despite the pleasure and &quot;necessity&quot; of the event, there was nothing that could convince Travis that what he was doing was not predatory debauchery.  It felt like he was taking advantage of his wife&#39;s state.  What would she think when her mind grew back in place?  What would she say when she could speak again?<br />
<br />
If . . . if she could think again.  If she could speak again.<br />
How would he find out if he didn&#39;t keep trying?<br />
<br />
It was quite the dilemma.  One that had sent Travis spiraling for the past 3 months.<br />
<br />
3 times a day, they had said.  <br />
Once in the morning.  Once at noon (during his lunch break).  Once in the evening.<br />
<br />
Wiping his eyes and sniffling, Travis drew closer, the lips of his penis coming closer to May&#39;s.<br />
The succplant&#39;s instincts kicked in as it sensed the sexual hormones of an aroused male, and the odor of the nutritious meal of the semen-breastmilk mix it had been fed for months now.  Expectantly, instinctually, May&#39;s leaves twitched, her neck/stem craning, as her head lurched closer to Travis&#39; member.  Clear saliva gently flowed from her lips as she, &quot;excited,&quot; instinctually began to purse her lips, opening and closing them, and then beginning to perform sucking motions.  Intermittently, May stopped to gasp and breathe sensually, moaning even, as her head gradually began to glisten with sweat, her cheeks flushed.</p>
