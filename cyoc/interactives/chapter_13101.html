<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mack rode down in the elevator to his mailbox in the main foyer of the residence, hoping for the usual money order from mom and dad... the groceries were getting a bit low lately.  As the elevator lurched he felt his belly sag down a bit, and knew why the groceries were fading so fast.  He had gained a freshman 15 last year (well... 25.) and had gained another 35 only part way through his sophomore year.  60 pounds in less than 2 years of college, pushing him up to 210 pudgy pounds.  That had to be some kind of record.  The doors opened and he walked to the box.  He pulled out his mail and turned back, but was stopped by Martin, the college mail clerk, as he passed the desk.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Hey, Mack.  We have a package for you today.&quot;  He said as he reached behind the desk and pulled out a large box.  &quot;Just sign for it right here.&quot;  he said, passing Mack a paper.  Mack signed it and thanked Martin, and rode back up to his room.  Inside he opened the box, pulling out a number of electronic components.  It was the Chronivac he was supposed to test for Transdem enterprises.  After a bit of work it was hooked up to his computer.  His Chronivac was finally ready.  &quot;Okay... let's see what this baby can do.&quot;  He said as he went to ready the portable emitter to accept his stats.  As he did, his room-mate arrived behind him.  Jarod...  he was a bit of a nerdy jock.  He was a swimmer who liked video games.  He also enjoyed teasing the rapidly fattening guy named Mack.  He slapped Mack's gut and chuckled, just as the emitter took in the stats.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Went out for lunch, did you Mack?  That McDonald's sure does a number on you, huh?  What are you up to now?  300? Maybe 350?&quot;  He asked through his cheshire grin.  &quot;Shut it Jarod.  You know I'm not that big.&quot; Mack said, feeling a little over-sensitive.  Jarod chuckled again &quot;Oh, you aren't 350 yet?  I give it a week, maybe less.  Anyway, I'm going out.  Don't lock the chain tonight.&quot;  Jarod said as he picked up his jacket and went out the door.  &quot;Great, he's gone.&quot;  Thought Mack.  &quot;Now, maybe I can change myself for the better.&quot;  he looked at the screen and was startled at the stats. 6'1&quot;, 175 pounds, bodytype: lean muscle... these were Jarod's stats... Maybe Mack could have some fun at this.  He began to change some stats.  The new Jarod would be 5'8&quot;, his bodytype would be that of a couch potato.  In fact, he was going to be 375 pounds, most of it fat.  Mack found the preference bar and slid it to G, then looked at the age options.  Should he make Jarod a middle aged man?  Nah...<br />
<br />
  There in front of him sat an interesting choice.  He could change the age of one specific body part rather than the whole body.  He clicked the scroll down list and picked out the one he wanted.  Genitals...  it displayed the size and age of Jarod's equipment. 7 inches, erection 10, aged 19 years and 236 days.  He put 0 in the years category, and 1 day in the days segment.  Question marks popped up in the other two sections, since they couldn't predict the change yet.  He could also change the ammount of time it would take to get from the current condition to the end result.  He thought about Jarods comment of &quot;I give it a week, maybe less.&quot;  with a grin, he set it to 4 days.  Then, he sat back and relaxed.  At roughly midnight, Jarod walked back in.  Mack activated the emitter and heard a slight zap.  Jarod swatted at the invisible fly on his neck and walked into his bedroom.  Mack pressed save and got up.<br />
<br />
  Mack settled into his own room and fell asleep in anticipation of tomorrow's awakening.  It was in no time that his alarm blared at him.  The red lights flashed at him 10:00.  He walked out of his room into the kitchen, waiting for Jarod to do his saturday ritual.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
  Jarod rolled over in bed and smacked his alarm clock.  It's buzzing wasn't helping him much.  He swung his feet over the bed and got up.  His boxer's felt tight this morning.  He pulled a pair of pants from the dresser and pulled them on... they were tight on his thighs.  He looked down to button them and got a shock.  His abs were gone!  Replaced with a soft curve that pushed at his boxers.  His defined pecs were soft too!  He was pudgy!  He ran from his room, bouncing as he passed Mack and into the bathroom.  It buzzed as it hit 195 pounds.  Mack was busy at the computer, looking at today's stats.  He had gained 20 pounds overnight and his dick had gotten 2 years younger, going down less than a half an inch.  He was pleased with the results.  Jarod wasn't.  He was panicking, thinking he had an allergic reaction to something and was puffing up from it... he wasn't sick though, so he must be in the clear.  He calmed himself down and went to get a shirt.  To his dismay, you could see the curve through them, so he chose his baggiest shirt and walked out.<br />
<br />
  Jarod worked on saturdays, down at the video shop on campus.  It gave him a chance to work around the games, gave him a view of the soccer field across the way, and allowed him to see his friends through the day.  He sat at the front desk, unaware he was swelling as he worked.  Hours passed, his shift from 11 to 7 was an odd adventure.  He felt bloated all day, his shirt was tightening around his swelling stomach and his boobs.  His pants were sinched tight, the button groaning.  The thighs of his jeans were pulled smooth across his hamhocks.  Eventually, 7 o'clock came.  He hadn't noticed the new 16 pounds on him.  His friends came and picked him up so they could go out to the movies.  As he approached the car, he could see them all whispering at him.  He climbed in and said &quot;Before you say anything, I know I look bigger today.  I had an allergic reaction to something last night, and it's trying to work it's way out of my system.  I'll be fine tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
  They sat down at the movies, watching the newest epic since &quot;the passion&quot; after a lengthy 3 and a half hours of battle scenes and naked Brad Pitt's (which were kind of piquing Jarod's interests...) the movie ended.  As the guys all stood, Jarod's pants lost their battle.  The seat ripped as he stood, and the button flew from them.  The guys all had a laugh, but Jarod didn't.  He finally took notice of his now 20 pound bigger body.  No wonder the guys were snickering before!  He was a fucking blimp!  He got them to take him home quickly.<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
  Inside his room, he ran to the scale.  He stood on it, watching it whir past his bulging belly.  220... another 25 pounds since the morning.  He turned to walk out, panicking slightly, when a tall, heavily muscled man blocked his view.  He was naked, a 12 inch cock dangling between his legs.  He was about to ask the guy who he was, but he could tell from the features of his face, it was Mack!  Seeing him like this was making Jarod horny... why?!  &quot;Mack!  What happened to you?&quot; he said, looking him over.  &quot;The same thing that's happening to you.&quot;  He said with a laugh &quot;Well, for the same reason at least.  I'm testing a machine that can change anyone I want in any way.&quot;.  Jarod gulped &quot;So... you made me fat?&quot;  Mack nodded &quot;Yeah, but that's not all.  Check out your whole body. You've gotten an inch shorter, and your dick as gotten about 5 years younger now.&quot;  Jarod opened his busted pants and looked in the mirror... sure enough, there it was.  The hair on his groin had receeded slightly, and his dick was 6 inches long.  &quot;Change me back!&quot;  Jarod cried to him.  &quot;...no.&quot; Said the now bodybuilder sized Mack.  &quot;Wait four days, maybe then I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
  Days slowly passed.  On Sunday, Jarod walked around in a pair of far too tight jogging pants. Swelling slowly from 225 to 275, his chest sagged and his muscles completely dissappeared beneath his fat.  His dick shrank roughly 4 more years, down to when he was 10.  His groin was hairless, his balls were tiny, and he was only 4 inches.  He tried to masturbate, but allthough he had an erection, he had no ejaculate.  Even so, the action of masturbation made him tired. He shrank another inch in height. By the end of the day, his jogging pants had tightened considerably. He reluctantly went to sleep in the nude, since he had no clothes.  Monday came, he didn't go to class. Now his weight was climbing towards 325.  His jogging pants stopped fitting by mid morning, his belly was sagging down over his crotch, and his hips got caught in the kitchen doorframe.  He found himself looking at a lot of gay porn that day as well, even though he now had a dick like a 5 year olds at 2 and a half inches.  When he hit 310, he heard the toilet creaking beneath him, as well as the floor when he walked.  He wouldn't sit on any furniture for fear of it shattering beneath him.<br />
  He fell asleep atop his swelling belly, which was surprisingly comfortable.  He woke up to a new 340 pound body.  He spent most of the day eating... a lot.  His new body was always hungry.  He should be at swim practice right now...  just out of curiosity, he tried putting on his speedo.  What a laughable sight he thought he must be, but he found squeezing into the tiny trunks really erotic.  He climbed onto the scale, whirring around to 350. &quot;Double my old weight...&quot; he thought.  Walking tired him out now, so he went and laid down on his bed, causing it to moan.  He woke up a few hours later to his final body. 5'8&quot;, 375 pounds, a newborn baby cock of 3/4ths of an inch, his tesitcles had pulled back into his body, breathing was an effort.  His door creaked open.<br />
<br />
  The now nearly 300 pound muscle Mack entered.  His huge package and quads were defined by his lycra shorts.  He had just come back from the gym.  &quot;All done, are we?&quot; he asked.  Jarod moaned a yes, begging to be changed back.  Mack thought a moment &quot;How well can you move?&quot;  He asked.  &quot;Not very well, but I can still get up and about.&quot; Jarod said.  Mack smiled deviously &quot;Wait here then.&quot;  He came back after a few moments of typing and pointed a small machine at Jarod.  It zapped, and Jarod felt relief, he was going to be normal again.  As he went to sit up, his stomach lurched forward.  He was swelling up again!  &quot;Well, we can't have you moving about now, can we?&quot;  Mack said .  &quot;So I've doubled your weight again.  And I think I'll do that once a day until the end of the week.  Sunday is a long way off, isn't it?&quot;<br />
Jarod whimpered softly as he felt himself approaching 500 pounds, it was getting harder and harder to move.  Mack slipped out of his lycra shorts and started to sport a growing erection.  It soon pointed out at 17 inches.  &quot;Good thing this is so big, or else, I might not be able to fuck that fat ass of yours.&quot;</p>
