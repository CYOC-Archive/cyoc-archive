<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was absolutely furious, he was lingering on pure white rage and knew he had to get out of there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merowww! Hiss!&quot; He screeched, and leapt out of Emily&#39;s grasp. <br />
<br />
She yelped in surprise, but in doing so she accidentally loosened her grip on the camera. As Paul landed on the ground, he realized what he had done and could only look in horror as the camera dropped to the ground. Olivia, Rick, and Emily barely had enough time to scream some variation of &quot;No!&quot; Before it landed on its side.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Paul blinked rapidly, and opened his eyes. He felt himself open his mouth as the sounds of men hooting and hollering entered his ear drums. As he looked down, he watched his chest, now soft and bouncing move sensually while his thinner arms had held a thick metal pole. He realized, as he saw dollar bills throw onto the stage and the click of the hot pink high heels, he was <I>stripping</I>, and with a hot body to be exact. He could see dark red tresses, clearly dyed and felt the jingling of earrings as he could feel himself... Or rather, <I>herself</I> working in muscle memory, sensually moving about and twisting.<br />
<br />
His body was one that was not that he remembered was natural, or perhaps, she was what she was meant to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon kitty! Show us a good time!&quot; Shouted a man in the audience, throwing a flurry of bills onto the stage as... Kitty, yes that was right, Kitty winked and easily traipsed herself onto the pole to the crowd&#39;s cheer.<br />
<br />
It felt right, it felt complete, the pink leather boa she had on her neck was taken in one dainty yet well manicured hand and whipped about to and fro. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take it off!&quot; Shouted another man, who was hollering and nearly drooling as Kitty smiled and blew a kiss, suspending herself in the air and showing her generously shaped rear end for all to see. She recognized that her outfit was rather easily seen, she was wearing a rose gold lingerie, mainly created out of rhinestones that held up her large breasts rather well, but, as it went downwards to her crotch, so too did the covering. Her ass, a trampstamp that read &quot;Daddy&#39;s Girl&quot; was proudly displayed where the tassles of the rhinestones ended on her rear.<br />
<br />
Just as she was working the stage and felt her cheeks blush in adrenaline, a proud voice echoed through the stage as three new spotlights appeared, each laying upon a metal pole for each.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t alone, she thought, somewhat disappointed the attention was not solely on her anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;And welcome to the stage... Rebeccah Rouge, Opulence, and your favorite and mine... the lovely... Es-te-fania!&quot; The MC shouted, to the roar of the men and (surprisingly, some) women in the audience.<br />
<br />
Kitty craned her perfect pout as she watched the three women roll up to the stage in a similar fashion as she did.<br />
<br />
Rebeccah had a flare of orange like hair, she recalled in the break room that she may have had some Irish ancestry, and her skin was as fair as could be. Yet, the pixie cut had given her a refreshing, youthful look in comparison to Opulence, who had age yet form. Whereas Rebeccah had a barely legal body with an equally young face (and made the red body con dress seem out of place), Opulence was true to her name, darkly tanned yet beautiful, she carried herself as though she was the best in the field. She had worn a Police officer costume, swinging the black baton in her hand as she whistled, a fake traffic cop, pointing to the pole as the men guffawed.<br />
<br />
Kitty scoffed, preferring to hoist herself up and make motions with her thighs while the girls began to move and sway, twirling about the poles. Opulence was more or less the only runner up in terms of looks, she knew she attracted the big spenders. Her black hair had been braided into thick coils with intricate gold and jewels across them. Her lips were dusky, despite the rouge lipstick, and her pink thong had given way to show her meticulously done navel piercing. She was also easily able to slap her ass and bounced them to the hollering of the best customers... <I>Kitty&#39;s</I>customers.<br />
<br />
Estefania, however, blew kisses as she slowly began to undress from her long gray coat. Kitty huffed, the sexy Latina, who had wore a simple, yet, alluring black fish nets that went up to a tight bunny suit. Her breasts, however, were too large to fit the cloth and hung to the crowd&#39;s eager howling. She gently put her gloved fingers and draped them across her thighs as she bent sensually for all to see, before slipping out her boobs before, to no shock of anyone, she pulled out a magician&#39;s wand.<br />
<br />
To the awe of everyone, she pulled out her gray fedora hat, revealing a pair of white bunny ears and lightly tapped her chest. Like magic, the lingering cloth beneath the bunny clothes had popped, granting a bounce that caused a shower of bills as she pretended to gasp and covered her mouth... Before laughing and backflipping onto the stage and pulled herself up into the air on the pole as the club pounded music into Kitty&#39;s eardrums.<br />
<br />
She sighed, feeling somewhat out of the loop as Estefania enjoyed the attention that was snatched from her grasp, it wasn&#39;t <I>her</I> fault that she wanted the screams of the crowd to make her feel good... But as she gawked at her looks at felt insecure of her own self... Suddenly Paula didn&#39;t feel like Kitty anymore. Thankfully, though, the club&#39;s regulars turned their attention back to her soon enough, and she was much more content to stuff a couple of bills down her chest.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Dalia sighed as she cleaned the tables, the job wasn&#39;t that bad, but between the men&#39;s volume, the smell of the alcohol and her inner introvert begging to leave... It was hard not to feel sorry for herself. She originally wanted to take the time to save some cash and maybe even learn from the girls, but her glasses fogged and her self esteem issues had rotted the desire and ambition to try.<br />
<br />
She took an empty glass off a table and placed the plastic tub of dirty dishes down. In one fell swoop she easily took a wet rag and began to wipe circles in an attempt to clean the tables as she looked into her distant reflection.<br />
<br />
Brunette hair that was tied into a simple yet unrefined braid. A cute, sleek even, face with somewhat chubby cheeks. Even her neckline wasn&#39;t too shabby, but her body was average, she could feel her arms had a little thickness to them, alongside her lower legs and ass... Maybe...<br />
<br />
Another roar of the crowd echoed as the announcer called, this time for the special woman Estefania. In her surprise, Dalia dropped the glass and prayed no one heard the crack as the music blared. Seeing everyone more preoccupied with Estefania&#39;s routine gave her some ample time to breathe and let go of her anxieties, before mentally noting to go to the broom closet and get what she needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang it, girl, pull yourself together!&quot; She mumbled, throwing the rag into the tub and lifting it, before a remaining black object caught her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello...?&quot; Dalia greeted the object, peering at it in a different angle as she inspected it, only to realize the true identity of the item in question: A camera, and not just any one, a very distinct camera that seemed to be a relic of a time well forgotten. It seemed too out of place for somewhere like this, and even she knew it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a camera doing here...?&quot; She wondered, placing the tub back down and rubbing her hands on her apron to clean off any smeared stains before touching the item. She peeled off her gloves and touched the camera gingerly, hearing the distant clicks and whirs as the Camera flicked its shutter on and off.<br />
<br />
She had half the mind to take the thing to lost and found, but, felt the odd desire to take a picture. Maybe it could be the start of something new, maybe something that could change her night for the better. No one would have minded if she just made sure the camera was working, after all, especially if a customer needed it back... Or, maybe, if no one wanted it... She could always pawn it for some quick cash.<br />
<br />
Dalia&#39;s lips curled into a smile, yes! This was her chance, to make things better for herself, perhaps the time now was to throw caution into the wind, to really enjoy things and get out of her comfort zone!<br />
<br />
She nodded her head, she&#39;d do this, one quick snap, and then the old Dalia would be gone, she&#39;d get contacts, take lessons, finish her degree...! She&#39;d be somebody!<br />
<br />
She raised the camera up into the air and pointed it at herself as the crowd jeered for more, sticking her tongue out just as all four dancers were on stage.<br />
<br />
Dalia could hear a bouncer yell out to her, that there was no flash photography allowed on the sign, but she didn&#39;t care as they came to her, she&#39;d easily explain and smooth things over. Maybe even talk to the girls and have a nice night!<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Kitty realized, just as the show was going on, that beyond the sea of admiring faces was a woman she briefly remembered sadly cleaning up holding some odd black object. Her smile faded, as Paula began to reach into her mind and realize things were simply not right, when suddenly, she gasped.<br />
<br />
Rather, <I>he gasped</I>. The camera was back out, and this time not in his position or... Wait.<br />
<br />
Paul turned and saw his family alongside... his daughter&#39;s... Boyfriend? All of them were dancing and gyrating on stage, at least, they had to be... They seemed too familiar to be anything but.<br />
<br />
Yet now, just as he looked back, the girl had foolishly raised the camera and was going to catch them all once again!<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Dalia pushed the camera&#39;s button, just as she heard one of the girls scream a loud &quot;NO!&quot; before light filled the room and capturing them in its familiar glow.</p>
