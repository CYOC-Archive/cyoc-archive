<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The April edition of Animalia Magazine not only talked about news in Animalia, but also included a schedule for Summer Events in Animalia and its colonies. This was good because many people were disappointed that there wasn&#39;t going to be an IAC until next year due to &quot;budget concerns&quot;.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The cover &quot;couple&quot; was Shyra and Jessica in the new female uniform for UFC-A. There were many complaints on the uniform not being &quot;sexy enough&quot;, but Brett Horne, UFC-A&#39;s organizer, made it clear that the uniform was designed to balance &quot;flirtation&quot; with safety and injury prevention.<br />
<br />
Their primary article talked about Jessica learning about &quot;flirtation&quot; from Shyra while Shyra having to deal with watchful parents and boyfriend who were making sure that Jessica wouldn&#39;t end up &quot;corrupted&quot;. The article also included the history of &quot;parental paranoia&quot; and how it evolved since the 1900s. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The other primary article talked about the history of hand-to-hand combat, and combative sports. Hand-to-hand combat was believed to trace back to both ancient Egypt and Sumeria, was officially dated back to the Minoan Civilization, and is most well known from the ancient Olympic games. The combative sports were at their most infamous during the Roman Empire, and the Gladiator Games. <br />
<br />
Not only was the history of the Gladiator Games included, but Brett was also introducing comments on whether certain parts of the Gladiator Games would be part of UFC-A (such as three lightweights going up against one Superheavyweight to make it &quot;interesting&quot; not being part of UFC-A due to too much of a risk of permanent injury).<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The summer schedule included several events spread across Animalia and its colonies. One event that got a lot of &quot;pre-registering&quot; was the Amateur Bare-as-you-Dare competition, mainly because it was also translated as an Amateur Strip Contest, and it would be taking place at all the colonies. <br />
<br />
There were other events that were &quot;colony specific&quot;. The Pee Wee Archaeology League, for example, which was designed to teach young children about archaeology was mainly going to take place in both the Egypt colony, and Vilcabamba. This was because children would learn about many of the things that would appear in museums.<br />
<br />
A Mieni Atoll-specific event was the Seaside Summer Solstice Celebration Event. It not only included a surfing contest (due to Mieni Atoll having been an undiscovered surf spot until it was given to Animalia), but also a beachside barbecue and luau, and a zoology camp/adventure for young teens.<br />
<br />
But the two event that everyone was looking forward to was the UFC-A Maiden Tournament and the Animalia Bodybuilding Club (A-BC) Bodybuilding Competition. For the A-BC, there would be Winners from the IAC to do the opening &quot;warm-up&quot; while those who were actually competing were those who were &quot;newcomers&quot; to the competition or were &quot;runners-up&quot; from the IAC. There were also representatives for either health supplements or sport drinks looking for Animalians to endorse their products or sponsor, mainly because they were developing new products that were safe for Animalians and wanted attention drawn to them.<br />
<br />
Another event was the Animalia Summer Track and Field Event, and the Mister and Miss Farmhand Summer Caretaking Competition. There were various reasons for these, some more obvious than others.<br />
<br />
The Mister and Miss Farmhand Competition was the most looked forward to because of all the &quot;active competition&quot; events. While growing and caring for crops was the primary reason for it, there were still those who wanted actual competition. While there would be events like sheep herding and similar events, the &quot;messier&quot; ones, such as the much demanded mudwrestling event, would not have children under the age of 14 present at all. Instead, such &quot;minors&quot; would get a special field trip to the Brown Farm to learn about what farming really entailed. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The biggest article was about the evolution of birds on Earth. Part of it was also to announce the success of the uplifting/reverse evolution of a chicken into a compsognathus Animalian. &quot;Compy&quot;, as he was now known, was now enjoying a healthy Animalian Lifestyle, had a new future to look forward to, and was the official mascot of Project Newrad. It got that name because it was both a fusion of the original name Niwrad; the idea behind the project was both NEW and RADical; and the rearranged letters of the first name of the Zoologist who was still cataloguing the species of Mieni Atoll and the father of the Ice Age Migration theory: Andrew Darwin, who was also a direct descendant of Charles Darwin.<br />
<br />
Compy&#39;s DNA was now in storage for those who wanted to be a compsognathus Animalian, but the scientist who documented it reported the process as &quot;not to be watched by the faint of heart, or stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also an interview with Doctor Stein, mainly because there were rumors going around that Doctor Stein was either an extraterrestrial or futuristic android. This rumor arose because he was seemingly able to control his emotions over converted (and especially youthened) Animalians pleasuring themselves during their conversions. Fortunately he was able to explain it easily:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dealing with watching converted Animalians pleasure themselves during their process is like dealing with the smell of dead bodies in a morgue or a crime lab. You get used to it.&quot; the interview revealed.</p>
