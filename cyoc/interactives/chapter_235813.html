Past that, anything goes, and since we&#39;re dealing with organic nanomachines with shoddy programming bonded with the common cold, a famous bacteria, there&#39;s bound to be mutations, and someone in R&D could use it in other experiments, so...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sylvia walked back from R&D, rubbing her shoulder, her sensible flats making little sound as she walked across the marble hall to the elevator. She tried to follow the jargon the two scientists in the office at the time were saying, but they were speaking so fast, talking about such complex science like &quot;organic nanobots,&quot; genetic restructuring, and something-something &quot;Hawking-Phase Variance&quot; that her mind began to tune out. Sylvia even tried to tell them she had a cold, but the junior lab tech, a woman, a woman named Steve Weljzok, seemed to not care, and the senior lab tech, an old guy seemingly two sheets to the wind and twice as crazy, a Dr. Anthony Weir, actually seemed EXCITED Sylvia had a cold. Sylvia remembered him rambling, something about how the genetic sequencers and organic machines will play with the rhinovirus, but it was terminology someone who went to college to be an accountant wasn&#39;t well versed in. They then injected her with something pink and said she was required to check in with them via video chat to confer any effects to them and allow them to monitor changes in real time.<br />
<br />
Instead, Sylvia was more concerned with making it back to her work station in time. The memo had only afforded her 30 minutes to go down to R&D and get back to work before they dock her pay, the tightwads. Sylvia got on the empty elevator, surprisingly starting to feel the achiness and congestion of the cold starting to abate. &quot;Huh, maybe whatever they did might have been a cure for the cold.&quot; Sylvia smiles, ignoring the fact her pants legs were just a bit shorter and in the back of her shoes the soles were growing a slight heel. Sylvia looks at the metallic doors, which cast a blurry reflection of herself, and tries her best to adjust her neck length hair, not able to see the faint strings of golden and platinum blonde hiding among her brunette locks.<br />
<br />
The elevator opens and lets her off on her floor, where the soft carpeting and quiet din of work, along with a radio playing classic rock in the cubicle approved by HR helped to mask the faint extra heft of Sylvia&#39;s steps thanks to the slight heel that had grown in her shoes. Sylvia, wanting to get to work on those quarterly reports ASAP, did not make time for small talk, even though she did want to stop and chat with Amy, Jameela, and Yuki, the three coworkers she got along with the most.<br />
<br />
Getting back into her cubicle, Sylvia booted up her terminal and got to work, plinking away the numbers into the books, filing expenses. What she didn&#39;t know was that R&D had been given access to her terminal&#39;s webcam and microphone to allow continuous monitoring of Sylvia, and the checkups were to just better analyze the effects of the test on the subject&#39;s psychological state. In their office, Dr. Weir watched, noting the hints of blonde ever so slowly overtaking her brunette, all the while her hair was growing longer. &quot;Hmmmm...&quot; was all he said.<br />
&quot;Um, sir?&quot; Steve said. &quot;Was the fertility formula supposed to affect the subject&#39;s hair color and length?&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s always side effects when you do SCIENCE!!&quot;<br />
Sylvia had no idea she had the misfortune of having been tested on by both the most eccentric lab tech in all of the Pershing Holding Company, LLC in Dr. Weir, who had the habit of creating the most batshit insane creations that somehow ultimately made the multitrillion dollar conglomerate massive profits, like perfume spraying rabbit robots, corn that attacks on command, and fire breathing chickens with heat vision, which turned out to have 300% more meat, were somehow pre-seasoned, and were immune to disease; and the most incompetent lab tech in all of the Pershing Holding Company, LLC in Steve, who had accidentally turned themselves into a woman, cloned a lobster that had the minds of all the worst autocrats in history for a brain and nearly let it take over the world, and made Electro-Cow a cow with lightning superpowers that is currently on the loose and Europe&#39;s number one white collar criminal, causing so much tax fraud. Because of this happenstance, she had no idea what was in store for her as Dr. Weir and Steve continued to watch.<br />
<br />
As Sylvia continued to work, she suddenly started to notice she was making the occasional mathematical error here and there. Normally she was great at math, not needing to rely on calculators or the spreadsheet&#39;s math functions when she was filling things out on the computer, but Sylvia did like to use the math function to double-check her work, and found sums and differences changing on her here and there. &quot;I&#39;d say it was the cold, but I&#39;m feeling much better since they jabbed me with whatever that was.&quot; suddenly, Sylvia lets out a light sneeze, but this felt more like a hay fever sneeze than a mucus-y &quot;you got a cold&quot; sneeze. As she sneezed, her nose shrank a little, there was an explosion of blonde in her hair, and her hair blossomed down to her waist. At the same time, her small B-cup bust jumped up two cup sizes under her blouse to D&#39;s, which seemed to stretch to accommodate them, but her bra seemed to be deteriorating. Her skin pallor, which had been a bit pale from the combination of her being not only often working in an office but a bit of a avid JRPG gamer on her off-time leading her to not get out much, and from having recently been sick, seemed to be getting a little color, a slight tan. Finally, after the sneeze, Sylvia&#39;s black dress pants had gotten even shorter, and her now essentially capris, as they barely reached past her knees.<br />
<br />
Sylvia felt like she needed to take a moment to get something to drink, so she decided to hit up the water cooler real quick. Along the way she passed by Yuki&#39;s cubicle, where she was also working away, but doing so just a bit slower than her usual lightning fast speed. &quot;Oh, hi Syl!! How&#39;s the quarterly going?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just fine,&quot; Sylvia quickly said. &quot;I&#39;m just grabbing some water real quick before getting right back at it.&quot;<br />
Yuki had come into the office today in a white blouse, red tie, red pants, and similar shoes to what Sylvia wore today, but Sylvia&#39;s eyebrow rose when she could spot that Yuki&#39;s pants legs were a bit short, like they shrunk a little in the wash, showing off Yuki&#39;s calves, and could see Yuki&#39;s belly button poking a tiny gap, as if her blouse also had shrunk in the wash, and did Yuki seem just a tad bustier, the typically A-cup Yuki looking like a B-cup nearing C. Sylvia wondered if this was the formula she got jabbed with playing tricks with her mind, because there had been reports of some subjects experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations and cognitive impairment before, because why would there be blonde highlights in Yuki&#39;s hair?<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... just gonna get that water and get back to work.&quot; Sylvia darts off, making her way for the water cooler, naturally moving in shoes that now had almost 2&quot; heels that didn&#39;t when the day began. Yuki meanwhile wondered why Sylvia came to work in capri pants.<br />
<br />
As she fast walked, her pants, which were now right at knee length, began to unravel along the inside seams, reacting to the sweat her body was emitting, sweat that was carrying the organic nanomachines that were apart of the pink genetic cocktail she had been jabbed with. With each step, the strands of fabric reached out for each other, and in moments, her knee length black pants was now a black knee length pencil skirt, and still getting shorter ever so slowly. Sylvia finally made it to the water cooler, glad not to run into another coworker, happy that everyone tends to stay busy in the mornings anyhow, keeping their socializing to lunch and afterwards. She gets her water from the cooler and begins chugging it, finding the cold water refreshing and relaxing, before fast walking back to her cubicle, her heels now over 2&quot; tall and heading for 3. As she walked past, Yuki did a double take, seeing Sylvia in the skirt, remembering she was in pants just moments ago, but in the back of her head, she though, &quot;Cute skirt...&quot; as without her paying attention, her own pants legs were starting to merge like Sylvia&#39;s, but also creasing all around the legs, leaving Yuki in a red pleated skirt that was knee length and getting shorter as well.<br />
<br />
Back in her cubicle Sylvia got back to work, hammering away at the report, her now E-cup bosom resting comfortably in her blouse without a bra, oddly not causing Sylvia any back pain, as if her back muscles were strengthening, evolving under her skin, basically negating the pull of gravity of her growing bosom on her chest and spine. As they migrated past F&#39;s and up to G&#39;s as she typed over the next half-hour, they were still perfectly natural, but almost seemed to defy gravity, giving the illusion they had a little something artificial in them. The upper buttons of her blouse began to unfasten, as if an unseen force was wanting to show off more and more cleavage. By this point, about half of Sylvia&#39;s hair was blonde while the rest of her brunette locks were slowly being invaded by the blonde invaders, and her hair had grown past her waist and was nearing her hips. It was when her tits, hitting H-cups, began to hit the Space Bar, that Sylvia, who was feeling just a tad spacey as she had been working, finally noticed her giant chest.<br />
&quot;Damn, those idiots in R&D gave me something that gave me massive boobies!!&quot; Sylvia felt a moment of concern she just called her breasts &quot;boobies,&quot; but was too outraged to dwell on that, remembering that they told her to check in with them if she noticed any &quot;complications.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvia fired up a video chat with Dr. Weir&#39;s office so she could talk to them, irate, but still thinking clear enough to know not to raise her voice to avoid making a scene.<br />
&quot;Hey, doc!! What&#39;s &#39;THESE&#39; about?&quot; Sylvia gritted through her teeth. Dr. Weir was already perfectly aware of this, as he had been watching everything through her webcam, and even got cleared to extend his surveillance to security cameras and other webcams on the floor and the break room.<br />
&quot;A perfectly anticipated side effect.&quot; he smirked. &quot;It WAS supposed to be a fertility and rejuvenation serum after all.&quot;<br />
Sylvia&#39;s ire shifted to confusion. &quot;Wait, THAT was what you jabbed me with?&quot;<br />
&quot;You WERE listening, right? Right?&quot; Dr. Weir commented.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Totally listening.&quot; Sylvia couldn&#39;t believe they were turning this back on her, but she couldn&#39;t admit she only half paying attention after Dr. Weir&#39;s second long winded rant on xenogenetics.<br />
&quot;So, you have nothing to worry about!!&quot; Dr. Weir says, ending the video chat. Dr. Weir then turns to Steve. &quot;We have a lot to worry about.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;What EXACTLY did you program the nanomachines with?&quot;<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Steve trails off. She remembered she just hooked up the organic nanobot servers to the internet, and told the AI to look for things that were &quot;youthful&quot; and &quot;sexy.&quot;<br />
Dr. Weir begins to cackle, looking at other monitors, seeing other women, and even men, on Sylvia&#39;s floor showing signs of blonde in their hair, regardless of their race, age, or ethnicity; older employees over the age of 30 starting to show signs of looking younger, some men starting to show signs of growing small breasts, facial hair in men falling out and vanishing as their facial features began to feminize, and a correlation of pants getting shorter and an increase in the number of skirts among the employees, but most surprisingly was how either some employees seemed to be working slower, or had just given up working and began surfing the web. &quot;Steve!! Close the vents and lock the doors to our office, because everyone else in this building is totally fucked!!&quot; Dr. Weir shouted in an oddly exuberant over-the-top manner. Steve pressed a convenient red button, sealing off Dr. Weir&#39;s lab from the rest of the building, closing the vents and dropping metal shutters blocking the doors and windows, and turning on an independent air system to the rest of the building.<br />
<br />
Sylvia decided not to worry about the giant boobs hanging on her chest, which had in the last few minutes graduated to I-cups. She couldn&#39;t reliably see past them to see that her blouse was partially exposing her midriff now, a midriff that was shedding her slight fat, her abs starting to gain definition as her waist was starting to push past supermodel thin and into cartoonishly thin, as her hips were doing the same in reverse, ever so slowly getting more and more outrageously wider. Her black pencil skirt had graduated to miniskirt by this point, and her thighs were thickening with muscle and a slight undercurrent of fat. She slid back to make room for her tits, and went to go back to work, before noticing for the first time her longer fingernails, which were starting to take on a gold color as if painted with gold nail polish, with a clear coat of glitter on top. &quot;Wait, the formula... did my nails?&quot; Sylvia then saw the time, 11:04 AM, and realized she had to hurry up. The quarterlies were due for presentation by 4 PM.<br />
<br />
However, the more Sylvia worked, the less her heart, and mind were into it. It felt like plugging numbers in and checking expenses was starting to bore her, and for some reason, was also starting to feel more difficult for some reason. Maybe she needed a break? Sylvia decided to be a little naughty and do a little web surfing during company hours. At first she went to some gaming sites, but after a few minutes, didn&#39;t feel like reading anymore for some reason. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I like these games, but reading about them, um, totally isn&#39;t doing it for me.&quot; Sylvia didn&#39;t pick up on the slight change in her voice&#39;s inflection, having raised about a half-octave, with a slight nasal undercurrent, with hints of a southern California &quot;Valley Girl&quot; accent and lexicon squirming into the back end of her sentence. After a few more minutes of looking around the net for something fun, and finding a position around her now K-cup breasts, edging towards L-cups, that didn&#39;t cause them to accidentally hit her keyboard or other things in her cubicle, she stumbled across a fashion website where they were selling short skirts, shoes with outrageous heels, tube tops, halter tops with cleavage keyholes, kneehigh socks and fishnets, and belts, and this locked Sylvia&#39;s attention right away.<br />
&quot;OMG, that top is so fetch!!&quot; she quietly squeals. Sylvia begins to happily put these scandalous clothing items into her online shopping cart, with each click, a few more brain cells seeming to shut down, a few more strands of hair turning blonde, lips filling up as they become the same glittery gold as her nails, years melting off the originally 32 year old accountant until she began to look like she was more like she was 20 again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly though, her shopping reverie was distracted by Yuki, who seemed a little panicked. Sylvia looked over at her coworker, surprised when she saw not the 40 year old woman who was a mother of two with a raven black chin length bob cut that came into work today in red pants & necktie and white blouse, but now someone that looked like a 16 year old gyaru schoolgirl rocking a red pleated miniskirt barely going to mid-thigh showing off physically fit tanned legs devoid of the light cellulose Yuki had begun to get, a white gold-studded belt with a heart-shaped belt buckle, her entire midriff on display, complete flat and ripped with no signs she ever carried two kids or was starting to become middle aged, very loose white socks going up to he mid-calf, hot pink sneakers that had 5&quot; heels in the back, various bangles, bracelets, and necklaces around her neck, and her white blouse mostly unbuttoned and cradling her K-cup tits. Yuki&#39;s hair, which was about half blonde and half black, was now down to her ass and tied up into twintails, held by two red scrunchies. Her lips were rather full and hot pink and slightly sparkly, like someone lined them with glitter, as were Yuki&#39;s nails which were about 2&quot; long. The final thing Sylvia noticed was how tanned Yuki looked, looking almost black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Syl, something is, like, totally happening to us!!&quot; Sylvia noticed Yuki no longer had her light Japanese accent she had from her parents and sounded like one of those ditzy airheaded Valley Girls she had seen in movies before. &quot;I, like, don&#39;t think anyone else has noticed yet. Come quick to the bathroom, so I, like, can talk about it.&quot;<br />
Sylvia looks at her own chest, then thought about Yuki&#39;s looks. &quot;You, um, might have a point.&quot; Sylvia gets up, just in time for Yuki to take her hand and lead her to the women&#39;s bathroom on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, the subject&#39;s going to the one place we can&#39;t monitor her!!&quot; Dr. Weir gripes, watching the monitors across the accounting floor. In the time since he had his lab hermetically sealed from the rest of the office, locking himself in with Steve, he had undermined the Pershing Holding Company security and begun to monitor the floors above and below, and not noticing any signs of changes in others. &quot;Interesting. I had assumed the rhinovirus would have allowed for easier transmission, but maybe not. I guess the nanomachines don&#39;t survive well outside of a host...&quot;<br />
Steve looking at a monitor hooked up remotely to lab sample of Sylvia&#39;s blood and saliva they infused with the same formula, and a compilation of gene sequences on another monitor, said, &quot;It&#39;s more like the virus has been mutating in response to the serum in the last hour, beginning to lose it&#39;s airborne transmission vector in favor of transmitting through other means, apparently wanting to favor fluids instead, if I&#39;m understanding these genomic readout right.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fascinating!!&quot; Dr. Weir cheered. &quot;That&#39;s... wait, how did they do that?!&quot;<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Steve again trailed off, realizing that she shouldn&#39;t of infused the AI&#39;s proliferation algorithms with scripts from zombie movies.<br />
&quot;My god, you are such an incompetent assistant!! Perfect!!&quot; Dr. Weir exclaimed boastfully, sounding almost proud of Steve&#39;s total incompetence.<br />
Steve meanwhile, realized, maybe she shouldn&#39;t be following in her mom&#39;s footsteps trying to be a xenobiologist, and should just taken her dad&#39;s advice and worked managing his series of fried chicken franchises across the eastern US. &quot;Uh, Im&#39;ma gonna put in my two weeks notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back in the women&#39;s bathroom of the 12th floor of the Pershing Holding Company, LLC, where the accounting department resided, Yuki led Sylvia inside.<br />
&quot;So, um, like, what&#39;s this about?&quot; Sylvia&#39;s voice getting ever so slightly more ditzy.<br />
&quot;Um, like, what&#39;s going on, and like, why isn&#39;t more of us, like, totally freaking out?!&quot; Yuki said.<br />
Sylvia saw both of their reflections in the bathroom mirrors, seeing herself for the first time, and while there was a part of her that understood things were spiraling out of control, and she should go back to R&D to do something about, an equally loud part of her brain was telling her she was &quot;like, totes hawt,&quot; and for some reason, that part was winning the argument in her head. As Sylvia stared at herself in the mirror, admiring how cute and sexy she looked, Yuki couldn&#39;t help but feel something brush her thigh. She shifted around to look past her now L-cup tits, which were housed in a wholly unbuttoned blouse that somehow in the interceding minutes tied itself under her massive mammaries almost by magic, but in reality had been done by the organic nanomachines now also coursing through Yuki as well, restructuring the blouse, and saw something that first shocked her, but then began to befuddle her. Beginning to poke out from under Sylvia&#39;s miniskirt... or at this point was more like a microskirt, barely reaching the bottom of her ass cheeks, lifting the front of the hem was a slowly growing penis, the erect rod rubbing against Yuki&#39;s right thigh as it grew. Yuki wanted to scream, but instead, the sight was triggering a different response, a response that made Yuki weak in her legs and sink onto her knees beside of Sylvia.<br />
&quot;Um, what are you-&quot; Sylvia asked, before being cut off by Yuki, whose brown eyes had turned a brilliant blue.<br />
&quot;I, like, totally gotta taste your yummy rod, Syl!!&quot; Yuki then abruptly wrapped her lips around Sylvia&#39;s growing cock, feeling the meatstick getting longer in her mouth with each pump. Yuki also lifted the front of Syl&#39;s tiny skirt to see that just under her cock Syl&#39;s pussy was still there directly underneath. She took her fingers, clad in her 2&quot; long hot pink nails, and began to tease and play with Syl&#39;s clit and labia as her left hand began fingering her. Yuki knew this was odd, but more and more, her mind was more interested in tasting something white and sticky in her mouth. Neither of them paid attention to the fact this fellatio seemed to be rapidly speeding up their changes, both of them growing a few inches taller, breasts getting bigger still, before finally settling at N-cups for Sylvia and P-cups for Yuki, their waists shrinking even further into cartoonishly small circumferences while somehow not impacting their ability to function, with Syl&#39;s waist measuring 16&quot; and Yuki&#39;s 14&quot; around, and their hips 3.5 times wider, meaning Syl had 56&quot; hips and Yuki 48&quot; hips, the last of their hair turning either golden or platinum blonde as Sylvia&#39;s hair finished growing to thigh length and Yuki twintails almost reached her ankles and gaining hot pink tips, Sylvia achieving a dark tan as her eyes also became a bright blue, and Yuki started to grow her own cock out from under her red pleated microskirt, her cock reaching a well-endowed 13&quot; in length and resting just above her vagina, while the hog Yuki was sucking topped off at 15&quot;. Yuki easily handled this however, as it seemed her gag reflex was completely gone, and she somehow knew how to breathe despite something so thick jabbed in her mouth and upper throat.<br />
<br />
Finally though, Yuki got what she sought, Syl&#39;s cock twitching and erupting down her throat, and Yuki eagerly swallowed it all, just as Sylvia&#39;s pussy spasmed around Yuki&#39;s fingers, letting out a torrent of juices onto her hands and the bathroom floor. It was right about this time the door burst open and the other two coworkers Sylvia usually spoke to arrived, Amy and Jameela. Amy, the usually shy and timid one with pale skin, freckles, and curly red hair, a 26 year old woman with strong Irish genes, who originally came to work dressed in an ankle length floral skirt, vest, and blouse; and Jameela, the fiery 55 year old head of accounting, the African-American woman with greying streaking in her originally dark hair she kept in short dreads that came to work in a maroon pantsuit and lavender blouse, were also showing signs of being affected, but no where near how far Sylvia and Yuki were when they first came into the backroom. Sure, about a quarter of their respective hairs were blonde now and longer (Amy&#39;s to her hips and Jameela&#39;s to her waist), were a bit bustier (Amy now up to an E from her original B, and Jameela only up to D from her starting C), and Amy&#39;s skirt shorter, only knee length, Jameela&#39;s pants also just below the knee, they seemed mostly unchanged so far. It may of had to do with their cubicles being on the opposite end of the floor from Syl when she sneezed earlier back when the mutated nanomachine enhanced rhinovirus was still capable of transmitting through the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy, I knew something was happening, but I didn&#39;t know what. The guys are looking like women, and women are looking slutty. I&#39;m sure R&D is at...&quot; Jameela goes silent and stops, along with Amy, when they see the fully transformed Sylvia and Yuki in the bathroom, Yuki still with most of the 15&quot; of Syl&#39;s meatstick in her mouth. Amy immediately covers her eyes with her hands in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luuu, mmmm mmm aaa huuuu mmm...&quot; Yuki waves giddily and happily at Amy & Jameela and tries to speak, forgetting she still has Sylvia&#39;s cock buried in her mouth.<br />
&quot;Um,  like, I think Yuki is saying, &#39;Hi, girls!!&#39;&quot;<br />
Hearing this blonde ditz say the one guzzling her dick was Yuki, Jameela made an assumption. &quot;Are you saying you two are Sylvia and Yuki?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like, totes!!&quot; Sylvia giggles, her voice now an unmistakable Valley Girl accent with a kind, innocent undertone to it.<br />
Jameela, determining her last leap of logic paid off, decided to ask another question she doubted she&#39;d get an answer to, but wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she did. &quot;Um, do either of you know how... all of, THIS, happened to you, and why it might be starting to happen to us?&quot;<br />
Sylvia stood there, dick still in Yuki&#39;s mouth, blanked out, like she was struggling to think, taking several seconds, before her face lit up again. &quot;Oh, like, I was, like, totes sicky, and like, the R&D peoples said I had to come in and test something, and like, they jabbed me with something pink and fun!! Said it was, like, a fertility drug thingy, I think!!&quot;<br />
&quot;R&D, of course.&quot; Jameela scowled.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a beeping sound came from Yuki&#39;s cleavage. She finally pulled Sylvia&#39;s cock out of her mouth, then reaching down into her P-cup cleavage and pulling out a hot pink phone with a phone case that had cat ears on it, a phone you&#39;d expect a sexed-up Japanese schoolgirl to have, not someone who was a 40 year old accountant and mom of two just a couple of hours ago, the phone apparently also having been altered by the organic bots coursing through Yuki&#39;s veins and secreting from her sweat glands. She pulls up the notification making the alert, having trouble reading it.<br />
&quot;Um, uh... Hey, Syl, can you, like read this? I&#39;m like, too dumb to read now, apparently!!&quot; Yuki giggled, appearing to be... almost PROUD of being stupid.<br />
&quot;Nope!! Me neither!!&quot; she beams.<br />
Yuki then skips over to Jameela and shows her the phone. &quot;Yuki, it&#39;s a reminder today is a half day at school for your kids, Toshi and Haruka, and you need to leave work to pick them up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Yuki said. She then remembered her kids, Toshi, her 15 year old son, and Haruka, her 9 year old daughter, having said something to her about this being a half day.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure you should be getting your kids in your condition, Yuki. Do you want me to call your husband Yusuke, or...&quot; Jameela said.<br />
&quot;Nah!!&quot; Yuki smiled. &quot;I&#39;m, like, totes fine!! I totally promised to get them, and like, do mom stuff today with them!!&quot;<br />
Jameela thought she should stop her, but not only did she also have a whole accounting department experiencing the earlier symptoms of what Sylvia and Yuki have gone through, including Amy and herself, but somewhere in the back of her head, something told her it was okay, to let her go, unaware this was the nanomachine enhanced virus at work on her as well, overwriting her common sense, a common sense that, if working properly, would have told her to keep Yuki quarantined there at work and contact R&D right away.<br />
&quot;Alright then. Um, drive safe then?&quot; Jameela said to the gyaru schoolgirl bimbo Yuki had become.<br />
&quot;Like, okie dokie Jami!!&quot; Yuki says as she skips along, touching the bathroom door handle, leaving a residue of Sylvia&#39;s pussy juices on it, and doing the same on the elevator buttons on the left elevator.<br />
<br />
That left Sylvia there, looking at Amy and Jameela. About 92% of all her thoughts, if you could call them that in her empty airheaded skull, was mired in a fuzzy pink cotton candy fog of stupid, cute, and sexy, where essentially anything that wasn&#39;t sex or fashion or love had been kicked out, and the very concept of hatred forever lost to her, no longer able to act with malice, with about 7% given to things that interested her prior to being turned dumb and blonde, like videogames and anime, and she still had all her memories prior to becoming a big-titty bimbo, from her childhood, her family, going to school, college, and working here at Pershing Holding Company, LLC, and in there she still had awareness she was Sylvia (though she liked being called just Syl now), but there was that 1% in there, that 1% controlled by the modified rhinovirus, a 1% that was telling her how fun it would be to make others, regardless of their race, sex, age, or ethnicity just as sexy and dumb as her, and just how to do it - to share her bodily fluids; saliva, blood, sweat, semen, vaginal juices, even tears - with others.<br />
<br />
It was then that...</p>
