<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark waited a minute before he approached Theo on the couch. He had leaned back, swaying a bit with his body, and was quietly humming the melody that played in the game the others were playing with his eyes closed.<br />
Mark set Theo´s shoes down onto his lap, surprising Theo out of his relaxing break. Looking down, he raised an eyebrow at Mark. “Why did you~ bring me my shoes~? Is it time~ to leave already~?”<br />
“No, no need to worry about the time, Theo. But for what could I have brought them to you?” Mark asked him smiling.<br />
Theo looked a bit confused, but also relieved at that. “If it´s not~ to go home~, maybe you want~ me to get~ something for you~. And I need~ to pu…”<br />
Mark stomped, seeing the opening he needed for his edit with Theo. “No, nothing like that. But yeah, I want you to put them on, after you pull off your socks and then throw them at Justin. And when the shoes are on your bare feet, you will pull the socks, that are now inside the shoes, onto your hands. And don´t worry about any of this being uncomfortable, you won´t notice the shoes or socks afterwards, even if the smell of the socks will never leave and you hate that.”<br />
Theo sat there, nodding at Mark, accepting his task instantly. He slipped off his socks and throw them, with them landing right on top of Chris´s discarded socks behind Justin´s feet, who again squealed in delight. Meanwhile, Theo was already pushing his feet into his white and red shoes, closing the Velcro on top of them. With little difficult he pulled up Chris dirty, green socks onto his hands, binding his fingers together even more. He scrunched his face at the smell of the socks, but said nothing, as he relaxed again, already ignoring them being on his hands.<br />
As Mark looked at Theo, like he did with the others before, the shoes and socks slowly changed. The shoes shrunk onto Theo´s feet, before deforming, taking his feet along the changes. While the neighboring toes merged in pairs, forming two out of the for smaller ones on each foot, the now three-toed-feet pushed them away from each other, spreading the outer ones apart. Next two spacing them apart, the deforming shoes on Theo´s feet turned a dark yellow, near orange color and thickened around his toes. Another, fourth toe formed at the back of the shoes, emerging from Theo´s heels, and each one ended in a little pointy talon. The yellow coating that had been shoes also climbed up his legs and ended just under his knees. Finally, it hardened into what maybe resembled hard, unmovable rubber, with only tiny joints in each toe to grab something in them.<br />
At the same time Theo´s hands inside the socks also changed. The socks shrunk formfitting over his fingers, pressing them together even tighter. The sock then stretched his fingers longer and thinner, as they more and more resembled naked wings. As if on cue, out from the sock-cloth grew small points, each turning out to be the base of the growing feathers, covering Theo´s hands and forearms up to his elbows in light grey feathers with green tips.<br />
All of the sudden, Theo jumped up with a yelp, and it was clearly visible that something was pushing his ass bigger in his shorts. Mark grinned, as he watched Theo fidget around a bit, before asking: “What happened, Theo? Something pricking your ass?”<br />
Theo looked over at him, blushing a bit. “There is something~ ins…”<br />
Mark stomped and said: “Why are you even wearing them? Tore the shorts away, they must be pressing your feathers the wrong way in there.”<br />
Within seconds, the shorts slipped down towards his taloned feet, where they were ripped into shreds. Theo´s wings weren´t made to rip anything apart, after all. Mark saw a couple of long, green feathers had emerged from were Theo´s underwear had been, right above his ass. Like the others, his underwear had shrunk formfitting while hiding his cock and balls away, and a small hole beneath his tail-feathers was all that he needed to release his shit and piss.<br />
As Theo sat back down, relieved his tail-feathers were free again, Mark asked him again: “Well, Theo, why did you wear the shorts?”<br />
Theo was still embarrassed as he answered: “I wanted to try~ them out~. Wear something~ beside m…”<br />
Mark stomped at him, before saying: “But you never wear anything below your waist, right? No pants or shorts fit over your tail-feathers, and why hide them anyway? It´s hard enough for you to put on a shirt with your wings, that´s why it´s the only clothes you ever wear, right? No shoes or socks would fit your talons, and no underwear would survive being pulled over them, as well, right?” Then Mark grinned at him.<br />
Theo nodded in confirmation of Mark´s comment. “Yeah, no socks~ or shoes~ would fit over~ my mighty talons~, and no pants~ or underwear~ would conform~ with my beautiful~ tail-feathers~” Theo nearly sung in tune, and then hummed satisfied.<br />
Mark laughed mentally, seeing how Theo saw his talons as mighty or his tail-feathers as beautiful was funny. That wasn´t part of Theo´s normal personality, being a bit shy and no fighter type.<br />
<br />
Just then, another round in the game was over, and Dean slowly gave his controller over to Theo, as it was his turn to take a break. He was the last one since Mark came in, and would now get his changes as well.<br />
Just as Dean leaned back from giving the controller over, Mark turned to him to start, grinning. He held Dean´s shoes out to him, dangling them before his eyes. Dean´s eyes narrowed in between confused and annoyed by that. “What do you want?” he asked icily and slowly.<br />
Mark raised an eyebrow at the cold tone, but asked away: “Dean, you know why I gave them to you now, right?” It was clear he wouldn´t, how could he know what Mark wanted?<br />
Dean, as expected, shook his head. “Why would I? You are confusing, do you want me to p…”<br />
Mark stomped, as he had to replace here, even if Dean would have guessed right. “You need to put the shoes onto your feet, and the socks inside you put onto your hands. They won´t be on for long, as you forget you wear them as you have finished putting them on.”<br />
Dean nodded slowly, taking his black shoes out of Mark´s hands by hooking his claw-like fingers in the back. Ever so slowly, he pulled out the dirty black socks with another claw, dropped the shoes down on the ground and slipped his feet in. Afterwards, he pulled the socks onto his hands, made harder by his never moving fingers to pull them up. As soon as the second sock snapped in place, Dean leaned back, not noticing them anymore.<br />
At the same time, they slowly started to change. The socks shrunk formfitting over his fingers, but leaving no trace of there being more than the three Dean used since Mark started. The socks on his fingers then hardened into dark-grey, rock-hard claws, unbendable for Dean. He wouldn´t use his fingers like that for the time being. On the hands itself, the cloth turned into a green, scale-like surface, covering up Dean´s wrists and a bit of his forearms.<br />
The black shoes had also shrunk onto his feet and toes, showing of similar claws as the hands did. Dean´s toes quickly became just the same colored, rock-hard claws, while his feet slightly deformed under the guidance of his shoes, raising his heels up a bit. The shoes themselves became similar, dark-green scales as had the socks. Even with the clear difference between scales and skin, nobody would know how to remove them beside Mark.<br />
Dean wiggled a bit on the couch, more tipping towards his side, as a thick, also dark-green scale-covered tail emerged from his underwear right above his ass. The underwear pressed inwards, leaving no trace of the trapped cock and balls underneath, but without pain for Dean. The same, small hole formed in the back, right beneath the tail, as had with the others before. It would be Dean´s way to relieve himself from now on.<br />
Mark was satisfied with Dean´s new look, so he had to finally ask: “Hey Dean, are you wearing anything normally?”<br />
Dean slowly reacted with: “Just outside, inside I only wea…”<br />
With a mean grin, Mark stomped, before explaining: “No, you like the cold more, so you never wear anything besides a shirt outside, and inside not even that, right? Right now, you are naked, and you never wore any kind of shoes, socks, pants or even underwear, right? Not that they would fit with your claws or your tail, right?”<br />
Dean accepted that without a thought. “Yeah, no clothes for me, only a shirt outside. I´m naked right now. Any problems with that?” Dean added in a cold tone again.<br />
Mark was surprised Dean still was so cold towards him, but that would come later. “No, of course not. You all are not wearing much, or anything at all, so why would I have problems with you for that?”<br />
Dean ignored the question and turned back towards the game, waiting for his next turn. Soon, he was distracted, and Mark left them alone, grinning wide. A few more small changes, and his pets would be ready.<br />
<br />
At his computer, Mark saved the newly made changes into the Reset-triggers, so their clothes would alter to fit the role every time they would need to. Only then, their own socks would slip onto their hands, instead of his brother´s.<br />
Another change he made to them was their living arrangements. From now on, Rick, Justin, Theo and Dean would live here, all together in Chris´s room. He made sure it would fit, even if he added another friend or two by expanding it, and similar to Luke´s rooms, without any difference from the outside. He added just one more bed opposite to what was the one of Chris, as they wouldn´t fit on it with four people, seeing that Chris would sleep on the ground anyway. And as he was at it, his own room also got a bit bigger, even if he had enough room before. He would find something for the new space, he was sure.</p>
