<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked to the Chronivac’s inanimate vehicle option and wondered what he would turn into.  There are a lot of choices to make and would be a difficult thing to consider.  But after a bit of a wait, he finally knew what he would decide and it is a real good one.  See, Jeff always wanted to be in the military when he reaches the age of eighteen, giving that he could use that experience to get into a higher university and following the steps of his father and brother.  Though he really wanted to fight for his country, the only reason why he wanted to be in the military, it’s to drive one of the most powerful vehicles out there, a tank.<br />
<br />
From what he saw in the movies and video games, tanks are a superb weapon of choice in both offensive and defensive.  The offensive is the huge cannons that fire rounds after rounds along with its build to plow through walls.  The defensive is the heavy plating that would take a beating, but still runs.  It’s is the ultimate ride when it comes to attacking your enemies.  Oh, he would dream of having to ride one for fun.  But of course, it would be a pipe dream, as it would take him years to get the license and training to do so.  But then, an idea just popped up.  Why wait to ride a tank when he could become one.<br />
<br />
It might sound weird at first, but he really wanted to know what it’s like to become a tank.  The feel of the treads on the rough terrain…  The force of blasts hitting him in every direction, but still keep on moving…  The excitement of the cannon firing a shell…  Being a part of a battle without worry of getting killed…  It would be very entertaining.  And with this Chronivac on the computer, he can become that very tank he wanted to be.  So without a second thought, he went on the computer and typed down the information it needed for the change.<br />
<br />
He worked on the details that he wanted.  From his name, the type of vehicle he wanted to become, the mental changes, the world alterations, the duration of the change, when to return to normal, pretty much everything.  Once he’s done with the info, he skimmed it to see if there is anything he needed to change.  On this page, it reads…<br />
<br />
Name: Jeff Kendrick<br />
Vehicle Type: M1A2 SEP Combat Tank<br />
Mental Changes: Yes<br />
Reality Change: Yes<br />
Awareness: Yes<br />
Duration of the Change: 10 Minutes<br />
Returning to Normal In: 1 Year<br />
<br />
Reading through the choices he was glad with what he made.  He chooses an M1A2 SEP tank because it is not only a powerful tank, but also an American tank.  After all, he is an American to begin with.  He not only set the mental changes as well, but the awareness feature on as well.  Even if he doesn’t remember his past life, he can still be aware of what happened to him and feel everything around him once he becomes a tank.  Another thing he did was the reality change cause when the changes are done, the Chronivac turn the world around him into something for a tank.  After all, the last thing he wanted is a huge tank in the house, destroying the floor and heading down to the living area.  That would be impossible to question.  And for the duration and returning to normal, he wanted ten minutes for the change so he can experience every detail of the transformation.  Meanwhile, he can remain a tank for a total of one year before returning to normal.  That way he could experience 12 full months of being a tank and the many adventures he would have.<br />
<br />
Feeling pleased with his work, Jeff decided to begin the change to a tank and click ‘transform’ on the bottom.  When he did, a pop up appeared that says…<br />
<br />
‘Warning: You are about transformed.  By agreeing to be changed, Chronivac Technology isn’t responsible for damage and/or death of the target.  If you die or get destroyed, the change will be null and void and you will not return to your normal self.  Do you wish to continue?’<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to this and could tell that there’s a price if he changed.  But he brushed it off and said, “Please…  Like a tank would get destroyed so easily.”  So he selected yes on the pop up and another message appeared that says…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac 4.0.  We hope you will enjoy your new transformed self.’<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled as he waited to see the change that’s going to happen.  As he was waiting, she screen fizzled and turned off, shutting down completely.  Jeff blinked and wondered what happened.  “Huh…” he started to say, “Why did my computer turn off like that?  Don’t tell me it crashed when the program was starting.  I was so hyped for this!”  He tapped the screen to see if his screen was broken, but as he did, something bizarre happened.<br />
<br />
The screen of the computer started to dissolve as it was showing the inside of the screen as chips and circuits vanished bit by bit.  It’s almost like he was witnessing the inside of the computer disappearing.  Soon enough, the screen was hollow as that too evaporated into the either.  He could than see the part of the desk dissolving where the computer screen stood as he could see the inside of the table visible.  It than spread wide as everything it touched looked like something out of Madonna’s ‘4 Minutes’ music video.  Jeff got up and backed away as the dissolving spot spread faster and wider, as the walls faded away to see the wooden skeletal structure of the room.  Backing away, he was in a panic and said, “Now hold on…  This isn’t what I want the Chronivac to do.  Get away from me!  I don’t want to die!”<br />
<br />
He placed his back on the front of the bed as he saw the floor vanishing, revealing the wooded boards, pipes, and circuitry of the house.  He turned his head away and closed his eyes, knowing that this was the end of him.  But when the bizarre wave of vanishing hit his feet, he didn’t feel anything and opened his eyes, realizing he was still alive.  Looking down, he saw something quite strange.<br />
<br />
For one, only his shoes and socks were unraveling away, revealing his bare feet.  That soon spread to his clothes as they opened up in the front and faded away in the back, having him completely naked.  Another strange thing is that even if the floor disappeared below his feet, he was still standing on something invisible, like he was floating in midair.  He keeps looking on as he said in fascination, “Huh…  That’s new…”<br />
<br />
He soon looked around as he saw his room evaporating.  He looked back to see his bed dissolving, showing the inside of the mattress.  He then looks up to see his ceiling going away and showing more of the skeletal wood.  Soon enough, the invisible sphere took away his room while he stood there on the invisible floor.  That spear soon spread throughout the house as he saw the other rooms around him, the downstairs area below him, and the attic above him, all of which is disappearing when the spear touched it.<br />
<br />
He kept on watching the spear spreading further and further around him as the house kept evaporating.  He could even see his own mom vacuuming the floor in her room, as the sphere was getting closer to her.  Jeff was in a panic as he screamed out loud, “Mom!  Get out of there!  There’s an invisible sphere that is spreading all over the house that’s causing things to disappear!  It’s going to get to you!”  But his mother wasn’t listening as she was still cleaning the room without noticing anything in front of her vanishing in the sphere’s path.  He starred in horror as he saw his the invisible sphere get close to his mom.<br />
<br />
When it to his mom, he noticed something very disturbing.  By the time the invisible sphere touched her, not only her clothes vanished, on contact, but the skin as well, showing muscles and organs midway through.  He could even see her actual heart beating and lungs breathing as they were slowly evaporating through the sphere.  Yet she was still cleaning her room as half the vacuum was gone.  Jeff starred in disbelief as he said to himself, “Whoa…  Trippy…”  Soon enough, his mother was gone due to the sphere as it spread all over his home.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, his entire house was gone, but he was still standing in mid air up to where he stands.  He soon watches as the world around him get effected by the ever growing sphere, looking at the inside of other houses, the vehicles, the trees, and even people going about their daily business.  He looked down as he saw the very ground got affected and is seeing the inside of the Earth itself.  The sphere grew wider and wider as the world around him kept vanishing more and more.  Soon enough, he could see the core itself as the sky darkened.  Earth was soon no more as the sphere reached the rest of the solar system as other planets followed suit and the stars disappeared in the sphere’s path.  He could even see the inside of the sun as well before that too evaporated to nothing.  Once it was over, the solar system was gone, and than the galaxies, and the whole entire universe.  Pretty soon, Jeff was standing in a vast space of complete emptiness in an invisible floor on him.  There was no air either as the sphere took everything in this world.  Yet Jeff was still breathing something and it is keeping him alive.<br />
<br />
Looking around the dark emptiness, a naked Jeff was amazed and said, “Man…  When they say that the Chronivac could alter reality, didn’t think it would take away the world I was in.  I wonder if the actual changes were going to happen?  As entertaining as seeing your own world vanishing around you is, I want to see if this program can turn me into a tank.”  Already five minutes in and Jeff could feel his body tingling from head to toe.  Shivering over it, he said to himself, “Well, I do believe I got my answer.”<br />
<br />
Looking down to himself, he noticed that his body was growing and the muscles on his arms and legs were pulsing.  Checking every part of his body, he could see his muscles growing as he started to age past sixteen.  He could feel his height increase as he grew past over five foot and climbing.  His muscle continued to ache as they started to bulge.  He flexed his arm and saw that the bicep was thickening and pulsing.  “Wow…” he said with a deepen voice, “I’m turning into a muscle stud.  I thought the Chronivac was meant to turn me into a tank.  Was there an error in the program?”  Looking down himself, he saw that he was past twenty and still aging at an alarming rate.<br />
<br />
He now hit the six-foot mark and has a body of a muscle builder.  His pecks were flat, yet solid while he saw indents growing on his mid section, starting to look like six-pack abs.  His arms and legs were increased with muscle as veins appeared on them.  His face was also starting a change with his body.  His jaw line was squaring up while his nose was wide flat.  His hair, which was cut a week ago, grew out and became completely shaggy.  Jeff kept on looking on and could tell that it was slowing down.<br />
<br />
In a matter of five minutes, his world vanished and he aged into a full-grown muscle bound man of thirty.  Looking down to himself, he could tell that he was a real life stud with over six foot in length and toughening muscles.  His chest was hard as a stone and would be used for women to rub on it.  His abs have upgraded in an eight pack and looked so much like a washboard.  His arms and legs were bulging with muscles and would look like he would be in a best man competition.  His face was incredibly mature with a square jaw; widen nose, and a handsome face.  His hair, on the other hand, was incredibly shaggy and it looked like he hadn’t cut it in years.  Jeff observed himself and said in a deep and monotone voice, “Damn, I look fucking stacked.  I never though that the Chronivac could do something like that.  Still, why did it age my body when it should’ve turned me into a tank?”<br />
<br />
As he was thinking of it, he felt something stirring in his nether region.  Looking down, he could see his penis starting to erect itself with a bush tuft of hair around it.  It grew to a solid eight incher and looked ready to unleash its load.  He watched in fascination and said, “Whoa…  My dick looks big and hard…  Completely forgot about that.  I wonder if I can masturbate with his big thing.”  So out of curiosity, he placed his hand on his cock and stroke it back and forth.  Giving that it was already big; he could unleash his load early.  But for some strange reason, he wouldn’t let it out.  So he strokes it harder and harder to get it out of his system.  He begins to pant hard as he closed his eyes in total bliss.  But as he closed his eyes, he didn’t know that more changes were taking place.<br />
<br />
 While stroking it, his dick started to increase more in height.  And eight incher turned into a twelve incher and then past the footmark, growing bigger and wider.  The same goes with his balls as they dropped in size and expanded between his legs.  It’s like his privates were getting bigger each passing second as he couldn’t get the grip anymore.  But it didn’t stop him there as he used both hands to rub his increasing penis hard.  But as his dick was growing, his entire body is doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
His height kept on growing as it past seven feet, then eight, slowly increasing in size.  At the same time, his muscles get bulkier and jagged as he was feeling a little squared.  At the same time, his arms and legs were going the opposite direction and was thinning and weakening.  So much so that his arms fell limp and he couldn’t raise them much longer.  The hair on his head start to fall off in clumps until he was completely bald headed.  The same goes with is privates as they unhooked and fall to the invisible floor, leaving his completely hairless.  Soon enough, other parks of the body start to disappear as well as the nipples on his expanding chest shrank to nothingness, his belly button filling in, and his ass crack zipping itself up.  As all of this was going on, his dick kept growing and was up to his head and kept on growing and widening while at the same time his ball sack grew bigger and wide.  Yet, he wasn’t aware of any of it.  His eyes was closed the whole time as he was in pure orgasmic ecstasy, trying to reach his peak but couldn’t.<br />
<br />
As his body was growing and getting wider, then his back started to bend and crack as Jeff was folding from the pressure.  It was like he was turning into the exorcist.  By the time he bended completely, he was lying on the ground with his face upside down and his huge dick on top of him.  Once he got down, his hands and feet begins to change.  First, his nails on his fingers and toes fell off and landed on the non-existent floor.  Then his toes and fingers drew closer together until they merge completely until pointy stubs.  His incredibly thin arms and legs begin to flatten as they started to grow long until the points drew close together and merged.  Indents started to appear and spread, looking like treads to maneuver through tough terrain.  Indents where his spine is grew and started to get round, looking like wheels.  They soon split up and extended to around the treads with motor gears and poles between it.  Soon enough, her legs and arms looks like treads to maneuver through tough terrain and around it were tank wheels to help ride through desserts and snow.<br />
<br />
With his body completely bent, Jeff’s muscle got more bulky and was starting to look jagged and nearly squared, making him nearly unrecognizable.  This skin color went a little dark as it looked like some used for camouflage and making it impossible to pinpoint Jeff.  He could feel his body hollow out as some organs shifted into the inside of the tank, from the seats, to the controls, engine, and onboard computer.  His human head was next to go as a piece of it started to disappear.  His ears shrinking and the holes vanishing, leaving him deaf.  His lips deflated and went flat while his mouth zipped up from left and right.  His nose migrated upwards to the top of the base of the vehicle and flattened with the holes extending and multiplying, creating a radiator.  Finally, his eyes glazed over and turned crystal white and incredibly small.  They soon spread wide and moved to the top of the front.  The head started to melt into the squared body and was completely absorbed into it.  The same goes with his brain as it merged with the rest of the body as well and all of his memories faded out of existence.  Yet somehow, he was still aware of the changes that have happened to him.  Like his arms and legs, the rest of the body and the head turned into the main base of an actual tank.  <br />
<br />
All that was left as his growing erected dick and testicles as they were the last to change.  His penis grew incredibly long and thinned into a small cylinder as the mushroom tip compressed and the hole was a little wider.  It tilted upwards and it looked like a thin cannon.  The balls were bigger and conjoined to sharpen into a rotating base as many things appeared on it such as machine gun turrets, a spotlight, and multiple antennas.  During the whole change he was still masturbating, trying to reach pure orgasm.  By the time the changes finished, he reached his peak as his former penis exploded.  But instead of cum, it was a shell that came out and flew to the end of the dark nothing before exploding from a distance.<br />
<br />
For ten minutes straight, Jeff went from being a sixteen-year-old teenage boy to a fully armored, fully equipped, military tank.  Though all his memories as a human were wiped out, he was still aware of what he is.  He just couldn’t wait until reality alters, so he could fight.  To go out and fight enemy tanks.  To fire his cannon and blow stuff up.  To ride on rocky terrain to see the sights he wants to see.  It’s going to be the most awesomeness year he’s going to have.  As the changes were finished, the black emptiness around him suddenly turned white and completely blinded him.  He knew that reality is starting to change and is transporting him to somewhere.  But where is the question?  As the light faded, he realized he’s…</p>
