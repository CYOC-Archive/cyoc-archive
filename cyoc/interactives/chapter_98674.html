<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As night grew later, members of the Anderson family and those who&#39;s lives they had touched or interacted with on a regular basis settled into slumber to relax after Monday&#39;s activities.<br />
<br />
WILLIAM ANDERSON +++<br />
<br />
A lone rabbit ran at a panicked pace through the underbrush of the forest area behind the Anderson home. It dodged an dove to the left and right trying to dodge its pursuer, but found it to be in vain as a red orange werefox, with its black ears, paw-like hands, forearms, feet, its white underbelly and the white tip at the end of its brush like tail pounced on it from above. The rabbit gave a squealing death cry as the werefox brought its jaws around the back of the rabbit&#39;s neck and bit down hard, shaking the rabbit vigorously and then throwing it into the air. When the rabbit came down, it was most decidedly dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, dad... I got it!&quot; the werefox declared with a smile as he trotted over and picked up the dead rabbit by its ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I saw,&quot; said William Anderson as he emerged from a secluded spot in his own werefox form, &quot;I think that&#39;ll be enough rabbits to feed the whole family.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young werefox, who looked like he was only about fourteen smiled with pride. He clearly loved praise from his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d best get back to the house with that,&quot; William commented, &quot;Your older brother will want to cut and dress that rabbit before we cook it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... can&#39;t I eat it here?&quot; the young werefox asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re weres, junior, not savages,&quot; William answered.<br />
<br />
The young werefox lowered his hears in submission and slowly began to follow William back toward the Anderson home. They arrived to quite a gathering as they got there. Nate and Alex, who in William&#39;s mind looked almost identical to Nate, were close to the grill and were skinning and cleaning several other rabbits that had already been caught. Both of them wore men&#39;s gold wedding rings on their ring fingers. Both of them also looked like they were in their twenties, but were a bit older than that. Eric was lounging on a deck chair with Julie with him. The two of them looked like they were still fourteen and both of them were in the middle of a rather passionate kiss. Martha and a fourteen year old werecat were also present and fully transformed while bringing out glasses of lemonade.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here are our brave hunters,&quot; Martha said with a smile and nuzzled her muzzle to William&#39;s, &quot;catch another one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Junior made the catch,&quot; William announced while Junior held up the rabbit, which Nate took from him and put it in the sort of assembly line that he and Alex were using to prepare the other rabbits. &quot;I think that&#39;ll be enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;and the Twists will be by shortly to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded while Junior approached the teenage werecat in Martha&#39;s shadow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sis,&quot; Junior said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, little bro,&quot; the teen werecat answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you call me &quot;little?&quot; You are only three minutes older than me!&quot; Junior answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still counts,&quot; the teen werecat teased and ruffled Junior&#39;s triangular ears.<br />
<br />
Martha and William chuckled at the antics of their youngest and looked up to see the Twists approaching from their backyard. The meeting made William smile to Martha as his family was all together and was truly part of Moon Lake.<br />
<br />

<br />
ERIC ANDERSON AND JULIE STOVALL+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels rather dirty,&quot; Eric commented as he and Julie walked out the back door of the Stovall home, &quot;what if we get caught?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then they&#39;ll have quite a show to enjoy,&quot; Julie purred to him.<br />
<br />
Eric turned to face her. Both of them were about sixteen from what he could see. His shoulders were a bit broader and his voice a bit deeper, and based on the bulge in the swim trunks he was wearing his penis was a bit bigger. Julie stood beside him in a sky blue bikini with white spots on it, which covered her presently CC cup chest, larger than Eric knew her size was at fourteen when they&#39;d started dating but wasn&#39;t yet as big as her mother&#39;s DD/E cups, though Eric felt that Julie&#39;s were better than her mother&#39;s. Julie&#39;s hips were also wider now and her body easily held his interest at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean we did agree didn&#39;t we?&quot; Julie asked to him, placing her arms around Eric&#39;s waist and pulling him to her, and relishing the feel of his erection through the material of his bathing suit and her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Eric nodded, &quot;I want to swim with you forever... but your parents... your promise to your mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and Dad went to California to see grandma, and possibly to consider moving her here to Moon Lake where they can look after her,&quot; Julie answered with a smile and a twinkle in her blue eyes, &quot;and you are the right man for me... I&#39;ve loved you since I first saw you, Eric... I&#39;ve longed for you... please... love me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; Eric answered as he kissed her and the two of them settled onto the cushion of one of the long deck chairs along the side of the Stovall&#39;s pool. This kiss was passionate and there was a great deal of drive between them. As Julie settled on top of him, Eric felt her hands settle on the top of his swim trunks and he could feel them being pulled down. As Julie did that, Eric reached up and undid the knot that tied her bikini top on and letting her bosom stand free. Her pink nipples were already firm and aroused and Eric carefully began to suck on one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh... Eric... that... feels good,&quot; Julie said to him with a smile as she undid the knots that held her bikini bottoms on as well. Both articles of clothing were tossed onto the lawn and Julie looked down to Eric&#39;s erection. She playfully wiggled it with one hand, making Eric take a deep breath as she did so. &quot;And this, my love, is about to get much bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie positioned herself above Eric&#39;s erection with a confident and loving smile, and while holding his penis up, she lowered herself onto him. She gave a full moan as Eric&#39;s member began to ease its way into her vagina, pausing only briefly before Eric gave a firm thrust and officially took his girlfriend and lover&#39;s virginity. The two of them settled into a fairly steady rhythm as Eric thrust into Julie and played with her breasts with his hands while Julie thrust her own hips forward and propped herself up to let Eric play with her breasts. Both of them moaned the other&#39;s name and looked into the other&#39;s eyes, and both of them could see true love in them... in Julie&#39;s bright blue eyes that twinkled like the sun reflected off of a calm sea. In Eric&#39;s the deep brown that at times gave a sort of puppy-dog look that Julie had always thought was rather cute. Both of them could see the deep love between them and felt a joy that they would be together forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh... YEEEESSSSS!&quot; Julie cried out after another orgasm rocked her body and as she felt Eric begin to erupt inside her. She then collapsed on top of Eric to cuddle for a moment, &quot;Oh... Eric that was wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; Eric agreed, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Julie replied, &quot;and thank you for becoming my merman...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt his body grow warm and as his pubic hair actually fell out and as the two of them climbed onto their feet. He knew what was coming. His body was beginning to transform and he would soon need Julie to complete the new him. Julie lead him slowly and easily over to the pool before helping him sit down on the waters edge. He trembled a little as his legs touched the water, but the coldness of the Stovall pool&#39;s water didn&#39;t seem to bother him. He literally felt that warm. Julie then stepped into the water, splashing him slightly as she dropped into the water. As she returned to the surface, her hands were webbed and Eric thought he could see aquamarine scales at her hips, though Julie didn&#39;t have a true tail, yet, so she was only in one of the earlier stages of mer-transformation. She put her hands on Eric&#39;s knees, where Eric could see bright crimson scales beginning to form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in, Eric,&quot; Julie urged him, &quot;the water is fine... and your loving pod-mate wants you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric let himself slide off the edge of the pool and into the water. He sank down briefly but soon returned to the surface where he embraced Julie and noticed webbing beginning to form between his own fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happening,&quot; Eric announced to Julie with a smile and felt his penis begin grow erect again. His body also began to rapidly change and transform. His legs were pulled together and his skin actually began to fuse together as it met. As it did so, a sort of flap of skin began to form around the base of his penis and pulling his testicles inside him. It formed a sort of &quot;vent&quot; that mirrored how whales and dolphins held their reproductive equipment within them. As his legs continued to fuse together to form his merman tail,  bright red scales formed all along his lower half and glistened in the light from the electric lights from the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie smiled as the two of them sank beneath the surface of the water, Eric finding he could easily breathe under the water and a clear lens had formed over his eyes, letting him see Julie in her full mer beauty with no trouble or irritation. Her aquamarine tail seemed to glisten in the light as well as Eric&#39;s feet flattened and lengthened out into fairly impressive tail flukes and as his much larger merman penis stood ready. &quot;I love you, Eric Anderson...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you, Julie Stovall,&quot; Eric answered as Julie opened her own vent to allow Eric&#39;s new penis full access to her vagina and the two began to mate again in their full mer forms, &quot;you complete me...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In their respective homes, Julie and Eric both shook awake for a moment, saw that their bedside clocks read 1:35 AM, smiled and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
NATE ANDERSON++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The crowd chanted &quot;Let&#39;s go Wolves&quot; in great excitement as the Minnesota Timberwolves were in heated battle with the Golden State Warriors. And while the Timberwolves held a fairly decent lead for an NBA game, the attention wasn&#39;t so much on the game but on the Timberwolves&#39; mascot. Nate jumped and cheered in his full werewolf form, with a specially made Timberwolves home uniform fitting over him. His tail fit through a hole in the back and it fit loosely enough that it didn&#39;t irritate his fur. Periodically he faked threatening poses toward the Warriors bench and after every Timberwolves basket he let out a triumphant howl that raised more cheers. It was if the fans put more responsibility for the team&#39;s play on the mascot than any of the players.<br />
<br />
As the game ended, a little girl holding a lollipop approached Nate with no fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, little one,&quot; Nate said to her, trying not to be threatening and demonstrate that the acts during the game were all an act.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; she answered, &quot;when I grow up, I want to be a werewolf, just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
MARTHA ANDERSON++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh,&quot; Martha gave a grunt as she sat down on a couch in the Twists home to sit beside Frances and Samantha, &quot;It would appear that some things regarding pregnancy don&#39;t change, regardless of whether or not one is a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her womb was presently in a very gravid state as she was carrying twins, which the doctors had confirmed were both girls. And as she looked over to her sister werecats, their own wombs appeared to be in an equally gravid state. Martha had loved her time in Moon Lake, and after ten years, she and William decided to try again for a daughter only to find that lightning had struck twice with it being twin girls, though the doctors didn&#39;t know if they were fraternal or identical. Around the same time that she and William had decided to try for a daughter again, apparently, Samantha and Frances had both visited the hospital and were impregnated through artificial insemination with the thanks of a sperm donor from one of the male &quot;werecats&quot; in their small pride. Samantha was carrying a daughter while Frances carried a son.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does feel magical though...&quot; Samantha said softly, &quot;to feel them move and kick... and... ohhhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha fell off into a contented purr as her kitten moved within her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how have things gone?&quot; Frances asked Martha as she reached over to rub Martha&#39;s womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... William seems determined to baby-proof everything,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;and while I love his want to keep his children safe... I hate those child-proof things... I can&#39;t seem to get into any of them when I need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh...&quot; Frances gave a laugh, &quot;the childproof lock... that no adult can operate, but any child can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, &quot;but he does have everything ready... if we go into labor, he can get all of us to the hospital in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this is Frances and my FIRST pregnancy,&quot; Samantha told her, &quot;it&#39;ll probably take us twenty hours or so to push our kitten out. It&#39;s your third pregnancy and you&#39;re carrying twins! It&#39;ll go faster for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t hurt any less,&quot; Martha answered as she began to go into the Lamaze lessons she remembered from when she&#39;d carried Nate and Eric, &quot;just remember to breathe and relax between the contractions when they come.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them then hugged to the best degree that their swollen middles would allow.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
But not all dreams were good...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
JENNY HARPER+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry!&quot; Jenny cried out as she stumbled around through a darkened hallway. Even with her enhanced vision, she could barely see. &quot;Harry, where are you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She received no answer and continued to stumble along, hoping desperately that Harry would appear and all would be well. But he never seemed to appear, which made Jenny even more nervous. Eventually she saw the glow of two red eyes at the end of the hallway and she eagerly rushed toward them, letting her inner vixen come out, wrapping her in cream colored fur, with short but still pointed muzzle and huge ears that were typical of the Fennec Fox. She was sure that the red eyes were Harry as the dim lighting in the hallway reflected off of his eyes in his werefox form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry!&quot; Jenny called to the owner of the eyes, &quot;Harry where have you been? I&#39;ve been looking all over for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer was not a man&#39;s voice and actually made Jenny stop with some degree of fear. The answer was female as a nude Red Fox based werevixen came into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s mine now,&quot; Yvette came into view rubbing her furred breasts, &quot;werefoxes prefer their vixens to actually HAVE breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Jenny began, as she was sure she actually had breasts as a werefox. She raised her paws to defend herself to find that her breasts were gone. She was built like a stick again. She only looked down in horror to find that her new breasts were gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;See...&quot; Yvette teased, &quot;Foxes love breasts and you don&#39;t have any!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Harry is mine!&quot; Jenny snarled and leaped at Yvette, only to have the rogue werevixen seem to vanish.<br />
<br />
Jenny landed hard on the floor and struggled to get up. Yvette only appeared behind her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe how hard he pounded me,&quot; Yvette said again, &quot;oh it was lovely and he declared his love for me and my voluptuous form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo,&quot; Jenny cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;Harry is mine... we had so much fun! I think I&#39;m pregnant!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOOOO!&quot; Jenny screamed.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen! Jen wake up!&quot; Jenny heard Karen&#39;s voice and felt Karen&#39;s hands on her shoulder&#39;s, &quot;Wake up Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny did awaken as Karen did shake her awake. She looked down to see that her greatly enhanced bosom was there inside an over-sized tee shirt that Jenny had always used as a nightgown. Of course, on the new her, the shirt wasn&#39;t so over-sized anymore, but that didn&#39;t mean she wouldn&#39;t wear it. She could also see that she was in her human form. She looked over to see concern on Karen&#39;s face as her roommate looked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were having a nightmare,&quot; Karen told her, &quot;You were screaming &quot;no&quot; over and over. Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was awful!&quot; Jenny cried and gripped Karen to her, she did nothing to hurt Karen, but her grip was firm, &quot;Harry wasn&#39;t there... I was in a hallway! And then Yvette was there! She took my breasts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can understand being upset about that,&quot; Karen joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she also took Harry!&quot; Jenny cried, &quot;where is he? Where&#39;s Harry? Where is my mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He had to go home,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;Remember the dorm&#39;s rules wouldn&#39;t let him stay here. Don&#39;t worry about him. He&#39;s fine, you&#39;re fine, and that rogue is going to the pokey. You know that. No one will EVER take Harry from you. He wouldn&#39;t let it happen... He loves you too much, and I wouldn&#39;t let them do it either. No one hurts my best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny only cried and held Karen to her. Karen patted her roommate&#39;s back, knowing that there was still some mental trauma that Jenny would be struggling through. Jenny seemed to calm down a bit, but it was clear that it was only because she knew Karen was a friend. Karen only hugged Jenny back and assured her that everything would be fine.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
BEN TWIST++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHHH!&quot; Ben cried out as he landed hard on the ground beneath the tree that he had met Kenya under after departing Sarah&#39;s company. Laughter only greeted him as he groaned and tried to climb back to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You realize you have CLAWS for a reason? Right?&quot; came Kenya&#39;s laugh as she leaped down from the tree and smirked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... to tear open deer,&quot; Ben gave a grumble as he looked to her.<br />
<br />
Despite being older, Kenya was easily smaller than Sarah in her were form, though that made sense tigers were larger than leopards. She was however, still well muscled, far more so than his moms and her fur wasn&#39;t as long. And while her fur did look solid black, at times he though he could see a leopard&#39;s rosette spots in the background. He had taken the time to actually ask Eric about that. The younger Anderson had explained that &quot;black panthers&quot; weren&#39;t their own species, but a genetic rarity when leopards or jaguars carried recessive genes that resulted in an all black cub. The spots were still there, and if one looked carefully were still visible, though at an obvious glance few would notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine are good for that too,&quot; Kenya laughed again, &quot;but that&#39;s not ALL they&#39;re good for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but I&#39;m not sure the branches that hold you would hold me,&quot; Ben answered, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really climbed trees since I was a kid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Kenya urged, &quot;it&#39;s fun. Even tigers and lions can climb trees when they put their minds to it. Surely as a werewolf can do it too!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Kenya leaped back into the tree and left Ben wondering what he did to get into this. Looking up and seeing that Kenya in her werepanther/wereleopard form wasn&#39;t wearing any clothes reminded him, and he made a new attempt.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
FRANCES TWIST++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s beautiful, sis,&quot;  Samson Carter said to Frances as she lay relaxed in Moon Lake&#39;s maternity ward, &quot;how did you and Samantha do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same way we always do it,&quot; Frances chuckled as she looked down at the infant baby daughter presently latched onto Frances&#39; left breast, &quot;Not sure how she got me pregnant... but I can&#39;t argue...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Frances actually shook herself awake at that. She looked around the bed to see Martha and Samantha cuddled up to her on either side, and a part of her liked being in the middle between her wife and their friend/lover/pride member. All three of them were still in were form and sleeping peacefully... well except for Frances at the moment. She had her wonders on how she and Samantha would take to being on their own after Ben grew up and moved out, and a small part of her wasn&#39;t above having the pitter-patter of little feet go through the Twist household again, but she also knew that she and Samantha were both female. So, unless Samantha was hiding a penis on her person that Frances hadn&#39;t found in all their years of marriage, it&#39;d be impossible for Samantha to actually FATHER a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... dreams don&#39;t necessarily mean what WILL come true,&quot; Frances thought to herself and patted both Samantha and Martha&#39;s heads softly, &quot;It&#39;s just a figment of the subconscious mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled to herself and lay back down.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
SAMANTHA TWIST++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now!&quot; a male voice cried out, &quot;we do this every twenty years, there&#39;s no need to squabble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha looked over to see a man with Eric Anderson&#39;s face, but he looked like he was in his forties. He carried the mixed scent of fish and men&#39;s cologne as a blond woman with blue eyes joined him. There were a few gray streaks starting to appear in her hair as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;But daaaaaaaad,&quot; a young male voice whined, &quot;Trisha took my fish-sticks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha looked over to see what looked like a ten year old version of Eric, but with blond hair and blue eyes pointing to a young girl who smelled of wolf but had dark mocha colored skin who was finishing off a set of fried fish-sticks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every twenty years for the Anderson/Twist family photo,&quot; the older version of Eric mused to Samantha as she realized this had to be in the future as a car FLEW overhead. Samantha soon realized that the blond woman was Julie, now Julie Anderson.<br />
<br />
Samantha looked over to a window and saw her reflection. She looked far older than she thought she was supposed to be. With that she realized how far in the future it had to be, as she looked like a human in her 80s, which meant that as a were, she had to be close to or older than 200. Ben and a woman meanwhile came around the corner of the house and got a grip on the young werewolf, Trisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you steal from Tyler?&quot; Ben scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler wasn&#39;t eating it!&quot; Trisha argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was holding it!&quot; Tyler argued back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you two get along?&quot; the female werewolf with Ben asked, &quot;You&#39;re practically cousins... given how close your families are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can&#39;t get along... at least for the picture,&quot; the older Julie spoke, &quot;we won&#39;t be going to the lake this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOOOOOOM!&quot; Tyler gasped, &quot;You promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised we&#39;d go IF you were good,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Trisha... you&#39;ll have an earlier bed time this week if you can&#39;t behave,&quot; Ben added.<br />
<br />
Trisha whimpered for a moment as Frances, Martha, and William came out from the door behind Samantha. Samantha was half startled to see William leaning heavily on a cane. Nate and Alex were close behind, ready to catch William if he fell. Though he did catch Samantha&#39;s surprised look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look as though you&#39;ve never seen me before,&quot; William laughed to her before giving a few coughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, dear,&quot; Martha said to him, &quot;Remember what the doctor said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does he know?&quot; William answered back, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;Just lost in old memories I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances came to stand on Samantha&#39;s side while Eric and Julie and Ben and his wife collected their children and knelled in front of them. Martha came to the other side of Samantha while William stood next to her. Nate and Alex knelled in front of their parents/in-laws. In front of them a professional photographer stood with some device that looked like a smartphone.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame the other kids and grand-kids couldn&#39;t come,&quot; Frances said to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marion and her wife are in Washington for the National Were conference for all of the weres in North America,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and Jimmy and his wife had urgent Skulk business to attend to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully no rogues,&quot; Samantha found herself saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; William chuckled, &quot;though... we&#39;ve all grown too old to really worry... no rogue will care about us and we can&#39;t fight... but we have what no rogue will ever have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends and family?&quot; Martha smiled to her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it,&quot; William answered, &quot;you know... even after two hundred years... moving to Moon Lake was the best decision we had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Martha smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was born here, so I can&#39;t really say,&quot; Samantha spoke earning a chorus of laughs. She found herself smiling as well.</p>
