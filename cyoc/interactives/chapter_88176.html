<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick woke in the morning feeling better but felt something missing. His dreams was filled with clowns, one of the goods ones was him and his friends decided to become clowns together and entertained people, goofed off and had a great time pulling pranks and gags. Mark was there and actually liked Patrick they held hands as they ran around town and she pulled him in to thank him for such a great time and ended it with a kiss. Patrick lay there in bed remembering the dream and great it would be if it were true but his mother’s knock on the door telling him to get up brought him back to reality. None of his friends liked clowns and Mary wouldn&#39;t give him the time of day and would never even consider touching him. Patrick got out of bed and picked him the clown nose feeling it warm his hand, if only the effects lasted longer than they would still like clowns. An idea sprung up in his head, of course when they wore it they liked clowns and nothing was stopping them from wearing this again. Patrick could get one of them to wear it and they could clown around for at least a afternoon, just be silly, if he was lucky maybe they would like clowns afterwards too. He got excited at the idea and got dressed and pocketed the clown nose. On the bus he evaluated who would be first but the opportunity presented itself.<br />
&quot;Hey Patrick, want to come over this afternoon and play some video games, I got a new one?&quot; Jake asked over the bus seats. Patrick looked at Jake and considered him, he was on the fringes of the group like Patrick not really the &#39;in&#39; crowd.<br />
&quot;Yea, cool&quot; he responded excitement building as he mental review his plan.<br />
The day dragged by and Patrick swore the clock stopped working on multiple occasions but finally the bell rang. On the bus he grabbed a seat next to Jake and they talked about nothing until they were at his stop. They dropped their stuff and went in to Jake&#39;s room where he fired up his game console and they started to play a shoot game against each other were the point was to put as many holes in your opponent as possible. After beating Jake three times in a row, finishing him off with a head shot, Jake threw up his hands in defeat as he watched his characters brains slide down the screen.<br />
&quot;Awww, poor loser. Here this will cheer you up.&quot; Patrick pulled the nose out of his pocket and jammed in on his nose before he had a chance to object. Jake rocked back at the sudden movement his eyes crossing momentarily before he started to laugh.<br />
&quot;Ha, where did you get this?&quot;<br />
&quot;I stole it from the clowns at the party.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ha, nice one&quot; He grab his controller and twirled impossibly balanced on one finger before grabbing it to have another go at not losing his brains again. Patrick watched him for a second and saw his skin start to turn paler faster than he expected. The game descended from a serious killing session to just the two of them goofing off cumulating in Jake trying to walk his character over a telephone wire only to fall to his death.<br />
&quot;Hehe, nice one.&quot; laughed Patrick as he tossed his controller at Jake who caught it and start to juggle the two controllers. Patrick laughed and Jake smiled his lips turning red as he tossed the controllers at Patrick who then tried to juggle them too but failed with them dropping to the ground. Both boys descended into a fit of laughter, Jake pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket to wipe his eyes and it turned out to be a chain of them which just set of the boys again. Jake&#39;s blond hair was starting to turn orangeish and his skin was approaching white. Patrick watched him excited and jealous at the changes happening to him and felt a stirring in his stomach. Jake stuffed the handkerchief back in to his pocket and paused to look at his hand, Patrick felt his stomach drop.<br />
&quot;Wow, cool look&quot; Jake held up his white hand for Patrick to see before jumping up and looking in the mirror.<br />
&quot;Awesome&quot; he exclaimed as he admired his evolving look. &quot;I think that nose is turning me into a clown!&quot; Patrick felt relief flood through him. Jake started to laugh and collapsed backward only to bounce up on to the bed. Patrick joined him and the bounced around, Jack&#39;s eyebrows disappeared and curly ones appear higher up and his hair turns into a curly orange afro. Jake did a summersault and landed on the wall before walking up to the ceiling. Patrick watched him from the bed as he hung from the ceiling defining all laws of physics and laughed. Jake dropped down with a double summersault and a half twist before bowing to Patrick applause. During the fall his clothes had changed to a very loud pair of pants covered in splats of color and bright yellow shirt with white cuffs and collar and a purple bow tie. He jumped up and with a fart and a shower of confetti a unicycle appeared under him and he took off into the hall rotating between riding on the walls, floor and ceiling zig zagging between all the family portraits. He hooped off and the cycle disappeared and he bounced on to the sofa, Patrick jumped on to the sofa with him and heard a loud fart echo in the small room. Laughing he Jake pulls a whoopee cushion out from under him and Patrick shivers at his touch, the two of them stare at each other before with a start they hear the garage door go off. Patrick quickly grabs Jake and pulls off the clown nose then dragging him to his room.<br />
&quot;You will change back to normal soon.&quot; Patrick said hoping that he was right.<br />
&quot;NO, clowns are cool. I want to stay this way.&quot; Patrick stood there stunned as Jake made this pronouncement.<br />
&quot;Jake you can&#39;t, your mom....&quot;<br />
&quot;Call me Jac&quot; And as Patrick watched in amazement the red spot on Jac&#39;s nose grew quickly before exploding into a full clown nose.<br />
Jac&#39;s eyes glazing over momentarily before he walked up close to Patrick and hugged him. &quot;Thank you&quot; He leaned in and kissed him on the lips, the new clown nose brushing his cheek. Patrick had never been kissed like this before, he had dreamed about Mary doing it, but Patrick felt the soft red plump lips touch his, a tingle spread over his lips and down his spine. Patrick stood there in shock suddenly lost in the moment that seemed to last forever as his blood pumped through him stirring the feeling in his body. Patrick found himself embracing Jac kissing him back before their lips open in a momentary kiss and it was broken. Patrick opened his eyes that he did not realize he closed and saw Jac bounding out of the window before jumping down a unicycle appearing below him and taking off down the alley. Patrick stood there still feeling the lips on his before he snapped out of it when he heard a door open and dashed into the hall. He saw Jac&#39;s mom walk into the kitchen, Patrick desperately trying to think of what to say before turning around and quietly moving back down the hall. He passed pictures of the family that now just contained three people, two adults and a daughter, nowhere in them was evidence of Jac. Swinging back into Jac&#39;s bedroom Patrick found a home office setup with two desks. Even more confused Patrick just decides to ditch it and follows his friend out the window and jumps the fence. Panting from his run from Jac&#39;s house he enters his own and finds his mom home too.<br />
&quot;Hi, where have you been?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, Jac&#39;s I&#39;m mean Jack&#39;s house.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh who&#39;s that a new boy?&quot; Patrick look at his mom, she had known Jack for years but apparently not any more.<br />
&quot;Yea&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I am glad you are making new friends but you know the rules you have to leave me a note to where you are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry mom&quot; Patrick makes his way to his room, closes the door and collapses on the bed. He pulls the clown nose out of his pocket and stares at it still feeling the tingle on his lips.<br />
&#39;He kissed me.&#39; Patrick wonders at this thought and how he ought to feel about it. It was great and he liked it but it was never something he had imagined or thought about before. His body stirred at his thoughts. He brushed his fingertips over his lips thinking of Jac, he was a cute kid. He was.... now he was a clown and didn&#39;t want to change back. Patrick&#39;s head collapsed into his hands, what had he done? Did the clown nose make him not want to change back? Why did nobody remember him? What would happen to him if he kept wearing the nose? Inside he was very jealous of Jac being a clown and he did look cuter and sillier. But he didn’t want to be a clown forever.  He looked down at the nose in his hand feeling its warmth.  <br />
<br />
He felt the overwhelming urge to put it on........</p>
