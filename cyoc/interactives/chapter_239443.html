<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The installation complete, Mrs McHenry doubled clicked on the icon as from somewhere else in the house she heard a door open and close. Guessing it was probably Rowan, back because she&#39;d forgotten something, Mrs McHenry was tempted to call out, but was distracted by what she saw. Reading the information, she thought it odd her daughter would have such a thing, but then wondered if maybe the girl had it because of, well, for lack of a better description, the penis she&#39;d been born with.<br />
<br />
With another sigh, Mrs McHenry reflected on her daughter, and how unhappy she sometimes was because of it. When she&#39;d had been born, the doctors at first assumed the child was a boy because of the penis, and had informed Mrs McHenry she had a boy. But this didn&#39;t turn out to be accurate, as it was shortly discovered the child had a vulva, as well as the fully functioning reproductive organs of a girl. And to further this, as they grew, the child had developed like a girl would, showing interest in things a girl would, behaving like a girl, even answering to the girl&#39;s name Mrs McHenry and her husband decided to call her.<br />
<br />
Of course, neither of the McHenrys had an issue, and loved Rowena just the way she was. They accepted she was a girl who&#39;d been unfortunately born with a penis, and knew, someday, their daughter would have corrective surgery to make herself look female when it came to her privates. Thinking about this, reading, then clicking, Mrs McHenry wondered if this was the reason Rowena had the such a disk, and if the software was intended for those planned to have surgery. Hearing footsteps come up behind her, Mrs McHenry listened as Mark came up behind her, and tempted to shut down the programme, she turned to look up at him as he inquired, &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; before leaning down to give her a kiss.<br />
<br />
June, after she&#39;d returned the sign of affection, explained, &quot;It&#39;s something I found in Rowen&#39;s room,&quot; and sighing, she furthered with how it might have come to the point where they needed to sit down and talk with their daughter and figure out what she wanted, which Mrs McHenry was certain she knew what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we give her first a chance to explain,&quot; Mark offered, and seeing the logic in what her husband offered, June nodded.<br />
<br />
Her attention shifted back to the Chronivac, she stared at the screen a moment before saying, &quot;Why don&#39;t we also figure out more of this software, so we are better prepared when we talk to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr McHenry, after he nodded in agreement, went to find another chair. Alone for the moment, June cycled through the limited options available before, curious to know more, clicked the scan option. Taken aback, the last thing she&#39;d expected was for the computer programme to do what it did, and seeing the detailed readout it present, she read with open mouth an in-depth profile of herself. Wanting to know more, she waited until Mr McHenry returned, and getting up, she instructed him to sit where she&#39;d been, then, after saving and closing her profile, had him click on the button to scan him.<br />
<br />
The profile of Mark McHenry now displayed, the two adults stared open mouthed at it, each wondering truly what it was their daughter had in her possession. Manipulating the software a bit, Mr McHenry managed to keep his read-out up as he clicked and brought next to the profile of June McHenry. Each looking at it, it was Mark who eventually asked, &quot;Do we do anything else with it,&quot; and with a shrug, June reached past her husband and clicked an option for species, scrolled the options, and set hers as Irish Elk. Watching as the screen blinked and her profile shifted to reflect the animal she&#39;d chosen, both were even more confused as Mark, following his wife&#39;s lead, changed his species also to an Irish Deer, then, after some thought, clicked the option and set his sex and gender as female.<br />
<br />
Again, the programme blinked and the profile shifted to represent the new information. June changing her sex and gender to male, she they each read the new read-out for the profiles, and after a bit, June clicked on another option, which dropped her age to two and half. Going slowly through the information, the McHenrys scrolled and clicked as they attempted to better understand the piece of software Rowen had, and when they reached the end, Mark McHenry stared at his profile, which now displayed a female Irish Elk of about two years, with no set date of death, and tried to work out what it was meant when he was asked if he wanted to make the changes permanent, set a timer, and whether he&#39;d be aware or if others would be aware. Thinking the only way it could be permanent was if it were possible for someone to genetically alter him so he was what he was seeing, he ignored the option of their being a timer or the changes being permanent, which they were set to the default of them being permanent with no option to change back, and after a bit of thought, and discovering he didn&#39;t understand it either why it would be asked if anyone would be aware of the change, as he figured everyone would, he left it alone, missing it was also set at a default of only him being aware.<br />
<br />
Next to him, Mrs Henry also read over her profile, now displaying her to be the same species as her husband, but male and two and half years of age, as well as there being no set death. Toggling through the change option, not understanding why the discomfort could be set as high or low, she moved it back and forth and scanned her profile. Not seeing anything changing, she stopped after a bit, fiddled with Mark&#39;s, and still not seeing anything changed, left them alone. Looking at the permanent, timer, and awareness option, she asked Mr McHenry, &quot;What do you suppose those are for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering the same thing,&quot; Mark replied before voicing his thoughts on it, and thinking it was time to have a talk with their daughter, June decided to leave them alone.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, Mrs McHenry pushed away from the computer, stating aloud, &quot;I think, now that we have a better understanding of this Chronivac, we need to have a talk with Rowena about it and what she intends to do,&quot; and making a dismissive gesture, she said, &quot;Shut it down and I&#39;ll go call the Louis&#39; and see if Rowen is there yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark, already in the process of closing the programme, nodded in absent manner as he clicked the option to execute, save, then the X in the top right corner. The Chronivac closing, Mr McHenry stood and was about to follow after his wife when he suddenly doubled over. Grunting in discomfort, he snorted, and suddenly found himself over come with the worst hard-on he&#39;d had in years. Having hadn&#39;t felt like he did since he was a teenager, if not a little older, Mark had enough time to wonder, &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; before he dropped to all fours.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, as she was about to reach for the phone, June McHenry stopped when she suddenly felt her nipples grow hard, her skin flushed, a buzzing, tingling sensation rippled through her groin and abdomen, and her inner thighs suddenly became very sensitive to touch. Giggling, then uttering a snort, she pulled lightly on the front of her shirt in an effort to fan herself as her body temperature spiked. This not helping, she uttered a low grunt, and forgetting what she was about to do, she instead headed for the patio doors. Fumbling a moment to get them to open, her mind for some reason not able to comprehend the locking mechanism, nor that the doors slid, June was relieved when she at last was able to step out onto the back patio. Uttering another snort, as the cool air didn&#39;t seem to alleviate her symptoms in any way, and instead made them worse, she sat down in one of the deck chairs, spread her legs and reached down and started to massage the front of her pants.<br />
<br />
From where he stood, unaware his body had started to thicken and how he&#39;d lost the ability to articulate any form of human speech, Mark grunted and snorted as he shifted in place. Worried about how he felt, as well as how it seemed his clothes were growing tighter, he was distracted when he smelled the most wonderous scent he thought he&#39;d ever smelt. Alternating between moving on two legs and going about on all four, he somehow managed to force himself to leave the office, the fit through the door sort of tight, through the house and out onto the back patio. There, unable to keep himself from doing so, he stopped and with difficulty, shoved a hand down the front of his pants. Trying to stroke his erect member, he was frustrated by how he couldn&#39;t do anything to ease himself. Oblivious to how his cock was shrinking, that his sack had already pulled tight betwixt his legs, forcing his balls, now ovaries, up into what was quickly becoming a vaginal passage and cervix, Mark struggled a moment to get his pants off.<br />
<br />
No longer understanding any longer how the one button and zipper worked, he was relieved and disconcerted when the seams on his pants, underwear, shirt and shoes burst. Wearing now nothing but a torn pair of socks, Mr McHenry bellowed his relief at no longer having the constricting stuff on and grasping his shaft, tried to work it, but was again upset when it shrank in his hand and he was left chasing between his legs what was soon the female exterior genitalia. Lying on the patio chair, which had at some point collapsed under her new weight, June had worked herself out of her clothes and was about to fully start to jill off when she was distracted by a loud noise. Rolling over, seeing Mark had come outside at some point, she was torn between several feelings at seeing him naked and how he somehow was no longer a he. Sniffing, snorting, liking the smell coming off Mr McHenry, June rolled off the broken piece of furniture, and as her chest flattened, her urethra and clit merged and started to push outward, she bellowed, snorted, and grunted.<br />
<br />
Head snapped up at the sound, Mark could help himself, now herself, as she responded with the call of an Irish Deer seeking a mate. Seeing June coming toward her, a part of her still human thought, &quot;This is all wrong. Why are we acting like this? What the fuck is happening to us?!” circled her mind, then was lost upon seeing the forming cervine penis Mrs McHenry now had. Uttering a series of bellows, snorts and grunts, Mark stood, dropped to all fours, and as her body realigned to a quadruped state, she turned to displayed her repositioned female genitals as a tail started to develop.<br />
<br />
She, now he, could smell the other deer, as well as see they were receptive to what he could offer, wanted to give. Stepping closer, June missed it how he was now walking on all fours as his body also cracked and shifted to better accommodate the four-legged animal he was becoming. Mind spiralling down faster than Mark&#39;s, June grunted and as his ovaries became testes and pushed outward, the cervix, vaginal passage and vulva reshaping into a sack to hold them, June the male Irish Elk grunted as with some effort, he forced himself atop Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; a part of Mark&#39;s former self asserted as she felt the heavy weight of June atop him, then the tip of June&#39;s penis rubbed against the vulva she now had, and thinking, &quot;I don&#39;t want this. This is wrong,&quot; she tried to pull away, but was disappointed when her body resisted and her mind fought against her, and she instead positioned herself better before again she felt her human self slipping away as she tried to tell June they needed to fight this, and instead was only able to articulate how badly she wanted what Mrs McHenry could offer.<br />
<br />
Transformation speeding up as June prodded and rubbed against Mark, stimulating them both as fur started to sprout across their bodies. Bellows and snorts of need, lust, and want escaping each of them, their hands and feet morphed into hooves, and as June lost the last bit of his human self, he plunged into Mark&#39;s slick feminine folds as their faces morphed. Beneath the now fully male Irish Elk, Mark managed to hold on a little longer to her male human self before she was lost completely to the animal she&#39;d become, with what finally pushed her over the edge was the feeling of the hard, erect cervine penis thrust into her, satisfying a need she no longer had any thought or words to describe. Antlers, heavy, thick, strong enough to defend with, the last to form, the two rutted until, satisfied, they soon separated. Sniffing at each other, grunting, the two-year-old and two-and-half year-old Irish Deer, who knew nothing of who they&#39;d once been, nor how they were now two immortal animals, soon trotted off, were they&#39;d soon be spotted and after a few days be caught and re-located to a forest.<br />
<br />
House now empty, reality began its slow shift to accommodate the changes made by the Chronivac. As it did, Rowen and Dennis managed to load Tristan into a wheelbarrow they&#39;d located in the garage and covering the transformed boy with a tarp, took turns wheeling their way back to Rowena&#39;s place, with a few stops to rest and make sure Dennis’ spell still held.</p>
