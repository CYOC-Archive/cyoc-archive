<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wondered... he could add or change any body part to the model of himself? Well, animal body parts would look kind of fake. Humorous, I guess - but fake. He wanted to share the results online with his friends. What about a third arm? That would be the kind of weird thing he could laugh at and share with his friends. He had been looking for a funny comic book idea - how about the guy with three arms? Or how about a third leg?<br />
<br />
A third leg...<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed to himself. Now THERE&#39;S a comic book idea. The &#39;Third Leg&#39; proverb. A dick so long that it&#39;s essentially a leg... so how about the man with two dicks - two sets of male organs - trying to make his way through life without being deemed a freak. Could he get the girl, or would he scare them away?<br />
<br />
That seemed funny enough. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t share it online, but he could pass it around with his friends for a quick laugh.<br />
<br />
In the sense that he was just wanting to add another feature to the model, the settings didn&#39;t make much sense. Finding out how to add or change a penis wasn&#39;t hard at all, and it opened up a few more customizable options: He could change the length and width, and he also added an extra set of balls to the equation. &#39;Targets Name&#39; was locked onto his name, but he figured he could just rename it to his comic book character&#39;s name later, whatever that was going to be. &#39;Morphing Duration&#39; didn&#39;t make much sense either, since the character wasn&#39;t going to just randomly gain and lose the second pair. Or, was it how long the morph would take to render? Confused and befuddled, he decided to move the slider to the lowest mark of time it would go - five seconds - and if he misunderstood that setting, he could just increase the time later too.<br />
<br />
Now, the Pleasurable, Alter Reality and Aware options didn&#39;t make any sense at all. Was there going to be some kind of animation once the model appeared on screen, once the morphing began? Maybe. It was difficult since the directions said that the screen doesn&#39;t display any type of imagery until the transformation has processed. He looked and searched but couldn&#39;t find any directions about this part either. He just went with his theory that there was some sort of animation involved, and set &#39;Pleasurable&#39; to Yes, &#39;Alter Reality&#39; to Yes, and &#39;Aware&#39; to Yes. This way the character would be normal in their world.<br />
<br />
He guessed that was all the settings that he needed to check, so quite casually he clicked the Next button on the screen. The screen asked him to reaffirm his set options, and with nothing else to gawk at - he really just wanted to see the funny image - he clicked Submit.<br />
<br />
**Process Initiated...<br />
<br />
And almost instantly, a full-on push at his pants. A frightening feeling came from his nether regions... he nearly fell out of his chair, stunned. Oh, it felt so strong, and so good! But so wrong!!!! He reached down to his trousers and felt something fleshy pushing against his hand. Oh no, this shit&#39;s real!?! Did he... just...<br />
<br />
**Process Complete.<br />
<br />
It had been the five best seconds of pleasure he had ever felt in his life, but now that it was already over... he realized inevitably, that this &#39;Chronivac&#39; had given him a second pair!<br />
<br />
His eyes got wide. The sudden shock was quickly replaced by morbid curiosity as he unzipped his jeans and released his boxers of the massive extra weight, and out they flopped...<br />
<br />
Twins!!<br />
<br />
Two dicks, and two sets of balls. Left and right. Almost identical, and definitely bigger than... before he had another one... Oh god, this was so weird. He was like a mad scientist, examining a new specimen under a microscope. He had set them to be seven inches soft. Of course, he reached out to grab. One in each hand, the sensation and the predicament was setting him off. He reached for his balls - the extra pair was really messing with his mind. He was feeling everything. It wasn&#39;t some other guy&#39;s. They were both his! The instantaneous need to jerk off flooded his mind. He was only sixteen, but was feeling like a porn star - the horniness was stronger than he could ever remember it before. Sure, his track history wasn&#39;t very long, but he knew what it was like. Now he REALLY knew what it was like. What would it be like to take a piss with two dicks?<br />
<br />
Wait a second... this wasn&#39;t right! He couldn&#39;t truly get by like this! This was supposed to be a joke! What if he couldn&#39;t fix this??<br />
<br />
But the temptation to just... try something with them. Just once. You know, like, this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance! Couldn&#39;t he adjust the time period of the transformation now? It was obvious what &#39;Morph Duration&#39; meant... now that this was a real program. Oh holy god lord! Shit! What was this machine?!?!! Surely a very lucid acid trip??<br />
<br />
The screen was flashing a &quot;Process Complete&quot; window, which displayed a pretty graphically accurate representation of his body with an extra dick and balls. For the first split second it was amusing to look at, until he caught himself to realize the machine had made his joke a reality - on him! God, the crypticness of this program! He needed to cancel this transformation. He pressed OK to close the window, and another window displayed:<br />
<br />
&quot;Save progress? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
He was getting really frustrated. And really horny. He needed to fix this fast!</p>
