<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin gave John his dinner then grabbed hers. She turned her face away from the couch and then jumped onto it leaving her fins to flap. She placed her plate onto her scaly lap and picked up a fork. John and Erin both picked up a piece of food on the fork and ate it. When John swallowed the food, he said to Erin &quot;So, how did you end up like this?&quot; Erin swallowed her mouthful but tears ran down her eyes. &quot;I didn't mean for you to cry Erin&quot;. &quot;No it's okay&quot; said Erin. She wiped her tear &quot;Well, it all started like this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About half a year ago, I was living a normal life like everyone else. I loved my life because I had a successful job, I had friends and even a boyfriend. I went out quite a lot like clubbing, festivals and pubs even though I don't like drinking. One day I went to the pub with my boyfriend Chris where we just talked whilst he drank and I ate. It was a pretty good day. All of a sudden though this woman walked in completely naked. Of course the men stared at her with their huge eyes. Chris though does the same. I thought though that Chris would turn back and talk to me more. Instead, he actually goes up to her and starts chatting her up. I felt sick and I ran to the bathroom cubicles crying&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris sounds like a heartless guy, I would never do that to any girl&quot; John said when yet swallowing another piece of dinner. Erin smiled but tears were still running down her face. &quot;Then what happened?&quot; John questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was obviously crying my eyes out within the ladies cubicles, Chris did not even try and talk to me. He was probably with the woman without even noticing I was there. About half an hour later, I dried my tears and stepped out of the cubicles. The bathroom mirrors hung there and I saw my true self, lines, wrinkles and all. I hated myself. Before I was about to leave I said that I wanted people to look at me like that woman. Before I had chance to leave, this woman suddenly came out of nowhere&quot;. &quot;I can arrange that&quot; she answered. &quot;Just sign this contract and you will have all eyes on you from sunrise to sunset&quot;. &quot;I thought for a minute and it was stupid of me but I signed it&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The woman suddenly laughed and I stepped back&quot;.  &quot;Yes all eyes will be on you but not as a human but a fish. From the first signs of sunrise to when the sun finally fades you will live your days as a MERMAID. The only way out is to get your boyfriend to accept you for who you are and to kiss you. You have a time limit of 5 years or this situation will be permanent. Oh look at the time, the sun is still out. I'll see you in five years&quot;. &quot;With a flash, she left&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knowing what would happen to me, I quickly crawled into one of the nearest cubicles awaiting my fate. I closed the door and locked it. A massive pain spread across my whole body. Within seconds my legs had started stretching and stretching. My legs were stretching towards outside the cubicle and my tights ripped into pieces. I had to tuck my 2 foot long tail within the cubicle before anyone walked in. My legs were now turning green and becoming bumpy then scaly. Then it became all slimy and sticky and smelt like a fish. My feet were doing the same but I quickly sat on the toilet before my feet reached outside the cubicle. My shoes were becoming tighter and tighter and then both of them ripped in seconds. My feet looked awful and they started webbing and fanning out to look like a huge 3 foot wide green slimy scaly fin. Next my chest felt a bit tight. My breasts were growing. My whole chest kept expanding until my bra eventually snapped and my blouse ripped off. I had grown to DD size breasts. And, as you can see, no seashell bra came with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are wondering how I got home, didn't you&quot; Erin said. John nodded and he looked so focused into what Erin was saying. &quot;Well because I was in the cubicle I was safe for a while. I was crying my eyes out the whole time I was in there because that was the worst day of my life. Some ladies came in and I kept my mouth shut. Luckily there is always another cubicle. Some ladies came i though and I couldn't help but cry and they wanted to help but I shouted at them before they looked over the top. In case they did try and look, I went right to the corner of the cubicle hiding my new tail as much as I could. A few hours went by and suddenly I saw it was almost pitch black except for the lights in the room. My legs and feet though underneath me were shrinking back. Within minutes, I saw my body change from a ugly, topless mermaid to a naked woman. I stepped out from the cubicle but the pub was still open. I grabbed what was left of my clothes and tried to cover myself up as much as possible. I didn't care what the other people thought but I bolted out from the pub and into my car as quick as possible&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was easy driving home because it beat driving home as a mermaid. I missed my legs but I knew my life was going to change forever. As soon as I got home, I parked in the garage, locked all the doors, ran to bed and cried. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning, I thought that it was a dream, but when I pulled the covers back, I saw the tail flapping in front of me. So that's my life now. I have to work at home now and I can only go out with my friends at night and I have to watch out for sunrise. I have not heard from Chris again&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish this curse would lift, I have had enough of waiting for the next night to come. I cannot go on holiday anymore, I cannot see my family unless the sun is down. Unless I get Chris to choose me for who I am, I'm going to be stuck like this forever&quot;. Erin threw her dinner across the room, curled herself and cried her eyes out. John thought of what to do next.</p>
