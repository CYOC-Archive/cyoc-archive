<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, Stacey, I'll make sure the dweeb gets an absent today, but I <br />
don't see the principal making you Valedictorian over it,&quot; Ryan said <br />
with a sigh.  His girlfriend was so demanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let me worry about that.  Vinnie Cost is the only thing you need <br />
to be thinking about,&quot; Stacey said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, hon,&quot; Ryan said leaning in to kiss her as his bulge <br />
grew larger in his jeans.  He added, &quot;Guess I'd better head over to <br />
the locker room. Don't want to miss Vinnie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan disappeared down the hallway.  He concentrated on sports stats, <br />
but Vinnie's face and butt kept appearing before his eyes.  Why did it <br />
have to be Vinnie.  Sure he'd pounded on Vinnie's ass since they were <br />
in Middle School, but it wasn't because he didn't like Vinnie. It was <br />
because he liked Vinnie too much and in the wrong way. Ryan started to <br />
get angry.  He wasn't exactly angry at Vinnie.  He was angry at the <br />
way Vinnie made him feel.  In fact, he kind of felt sorry for Vinnie.  <br />
He thought Vin would make a good Valedictory speech.  It would be <br />
better than Stacey's for sure.<br />
<br />
Stacey- he shook his head - how had he gotten himself so entangled <br />
with the bitch?  Well, at least no one thought he was gay.  He was the <br />
star athlete, she was a cheerleader and a brain. They were the perfect <br />
teen couple. Ryan paused in front of a display cabinet in the hallway.  <br />
It showed photos of last year's prom. He bit his lip.  It had been a <br />
bit of controversy.  There wasn't even a photo of the two guys who had <br />
gone as a couple in the display, but Ryan remembered it from the <br />
paper. He pictured himself being crowned king at this year's prom and <br />
Vinnie Cost as Ryan Standish's queen.  He shook his head.  It had to <br />
be Stacey. He wanted that scholarship to state, he couldn't see them <br />
giving it to a homo.  Then there was his father to think of - and the <br />
beating he'd get.<br />
<br />
He recalled his father cracking his broad leather belt and saying <br />
about the gay prom boys, &quot;Hell, if was that boy's father, I'd <br />
straighten him out for good. Some folks just don't know the proper way <br />
to raise their kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan was sweating and red by the time he reached the locker room. He <br />
headed to his locker, and quickly stripped.  His buddies Horst and <br />
Carter were there. They were best buds, but he had never told them his <br />
dirty dark secret.  He briefly told them what Stacey demanded.  He <br />
hated to be viewed as pussy whipped, but it was better than dick <br />
whipped.  Wasn't it?<br />
<br />
He frowned and headed naked over to Vinnie's locker.  Vinnie was just <br />
about to step into his jockstrap when Ryan's powerful hand closed <br />
around the pouch and pulled it out of Vinnie's hands.  The back of his <br />
hand slapped against Vinnie's cock head. Ryan licked his lips he felt <br />
an unwanted stirring in his loins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Vinnie said as he reached for it. Ryan held it dangling over <br />
his head. They were both seniors, but compared to Ryan he looks like a <br />
freshman, or maybe Ryan look more like he's 24 instead of 18.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want it?&quot; Ryan taunted raising and lowering Vinnie's jock strap <br />
just in and out of reach. Vinnie glance at the clock on the locker <br />
room wall, 3 minutes. He couldn't afford another tardy, let alone an <br />
absence. PE is Vinnie's worst subject. It brings down his entire GPA, <br />
they keep saying that the school district will make it pass/fail, but <br />
they've said that since Vinnie and Ryan started middle school. <br />
<br />
Ryan was frustrated and angry. He didn't want to be Stacey's flunky.  <br />
He didn't like playing the bully.  He sure as hell didn't want anyone <br />
noticing that his cock was getting hard as he stood on the bench with <br />
his cock waving under Vinnie's nose. He dangled the jockstrap to draw <br />
Vinnie's attention away from Ryan's cock.<br />
<br />
Vinnie said, &quot;Well, if you have such a fetish for my old jockstrap, <br />
Ryan, I'll be happy to give it to you after class. Then it'll be even <br />
riper than it is now, after a week of my wearing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look of anger and disgust on Ryan's face was classic, his nose <br />
crinkled up, and his mouth look like he'd eaten a lemon. In holding <br />
the strap just out of my reach, he'd been holding it right in front of <br />
his own nose. It produced a reaction that I should have expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want it, perv, then go get it!&quot; The star of the football team <br />
hurled Vinnie's jockstrap up toward the ceiling. Ryan aimed for the <br />
light fixture, but overshot his target.  He thought for a moment it <br />
would fall back to the ground. It hooked on a fire sprinkler about 10 <br />
feet off the ground.<br />
<br />
The bastard Ryan smiled smugly, glanced at the clock. Two minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't want to be late. Heh, heh,&quot; Ryan said hopping down off <br />
the bench.<br />
<br />
Vinnie grabbed his wrist, &quot;You're going to replace my jock, you dumb <br />
jock!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you call me?&quot; Ryan growled.  He was furious as he was horny.  <br />
Vinnie's touch and scent.  He felt his cock rising. Ryan gripped <br />
Vinnie's hand on his wrist with his other hand. Vinnie knew he was in <br />
deep shit, but held tight for dear life. He couldn't pound Vinnie, if <br />
he couldn't use his fist. At least, that was what Vinnie hoped he <br />
thought that since he'd grabbed my hand with his free hand instead of <br />
punching. &quot;And how the hell d'ya expect me to &quot;replace your jock&quot;, <br />
little boy?&quot; He glanced toward my jock hanging precariously from the <br />
sprinkler.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU WILL REPLACE MY JOCK, YOU DUMB JOCK!&quot; Vinnie turned bright red, <br />
he could feel the heat radiating from his body. Ryan could feel it <br />
too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure not climbing up there! And I'm not giving you my jock, perv. <br />
The stores don't open until 9. I guess you're not going to be <br />
valedictorian after all,&quot; there was a twang of regret in Ryan's voice, <br />
though no one noticed it except him.<br />
<br />
Then Ryan had an idea.  A way to explore his odd desires without <br />
letting anyone know. His eyes locked on Vinnie's crotch.  His granny <br />
lived in the mountains and until he was eleven, he lived with her.  <br />
She taught him the old ways. The ways to shift. He'd done it alone in <br />
his room at night. Never in front of anyone. It took a lot out of him, <br />
and he wouldn't change back for hours. Still he regretted what he'd <br />
done. Vinnie deserved to be Valedictorian.  Ryan deserved to be <br />
punished.  He wanted to find out what it was like to cradle Vinnie's <br />
sweet ass, and his manhood.  As Ryan, he could never do that, but as a <br />
&quot;dumb jock.&quot;  He licked his lips.<br />
<br />
Ryan looked strangely pale. His breath changed, his face was inches <br />
from Vinnie's, and he was breathing right on my nose. Vinnie focused <br />
on Ryan's mouth, he didn't notice the erect penis dripping precum an <br />
inch from his chest. Ryan's breath had been minty fresh from his <br />
morning mouth wash, now it started to smell like, like...like clean <br />
laundry. Weird. His wrist crumpled in my hand. The weight of his body <br />
that had been pressing against Vinnie vanished. Ryan was gone. Vinnie <br />
was holding a jockstrap. He stared at it. The way the pouch crumpled <br />
it looked like a bas relief of Ryan's startled face.  Ryan would have <br />
been relieved to learn that Vinnie mistook his expression of lust to <br />
be a look of surprise.<br />
<br />
The clock said Vinnie had barely a minute. Vinnie stepped into the <br />
jock, hastily pulled on shorts, socks and shoes, and ran toward the <br />
gym with his tee shirt in hand.<br />
<br />
Ryan relaxed exhausted from his transformation, and heady from the <br />
scent of Vinnie's manhood filling his pouch.  It was wrong, but it was <br />
so good.  He was hoping the coach would give Vinnie extra laps, he'd <br />
enjoy lapping up Vinnie's musky sweat. He felt guilty that he'd enjoy <br />
it, but he was resigned too.  The shift would last at least until the <br />
end of the day, and since he couldn't do anything about it.  Ryan <br />
decided to enjoy it.  He'd forget about Stacy, his pa, his homophobia, <br />
and his friends.  He was Vinnie's jockstrap for now, and he'd be the <br />
best damn jockstrap he could be. <br />
<br />
Unintentionally, Ryan's pouch started to tighten around Vinnie's <br />
manhood.  The tightness produced a reaction, and Ryan felt his pouch <br />
being forced outward as Vinnie's manhood swelled with blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just made it, Cost!&quot; shouted the coach, &quot;Horst, Carter, you two are <br />
tardy. Where's your buddy Standish? I saw him the hallway earlier.&quot;</p>
