<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen found Leon and Regina Talbot more than welcoming as she and Peter arrived at his home. Leon shook her hand and Regina gave her a warm and friendly hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s great to see you!&quot; Regina commented, &quot;You should have called, we would have saved you some dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ate at the college, but thank you,&quot; Karen said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you here for the night?&quot; Leon asked, &quot;should we give you and Peter some space?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen knew that was a possible reference to what she knew would come eventually when she and Peter took their love to the next level and she became his lioness, but neither of them had planned to do that tonight. In fact, the nervousness over this second agent from Alabama and the threat he represented would have cancelled that even if she and Peter had planned to take that step.<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually need to set up the guest room,&quot; Peter said to his father, &quot;as there have been some... complications.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Complications?&quot; Leon wondered as he looked to Regina. His wife shrugged and the two of them looked to Karen and Peter with some puzzlement obvious in their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dieter Wilhelm... the guy who&#39;s had the hots for Jenny and may cause trouble at the wedding has sent a second agent here to Moon Lake,&quot; Karen began slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Second...?&quot; Regina gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first one arrived here on the night that I&#39;d first met you and Leon,&quot; Karen explained, &quot;and went straight to our dorm, likely to kidnap Jenny on sight... And with the suspicion that he&#39;d be ordered to kill Harry, there is no knowing what that guy would have done if Jenny or I were there and resisted...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus with a second agent sent... the college isn&#39;t taking chances,&quot; Peter added, &quot;They have Jenny and Harry in their safe room and asked Karen to stay outside her dorm... just in case that guy does try what the first agent did. Karen asked if she could stay until all this blows over and Wilhelm and his agents either leave or reveal themselves in such away that they can be arrested or stopped for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter tried to keep his voice calm and restrained, but both Leon and Regina could hear tones that would indicate a great deal of anger and protectiveness that Peter was restraining. Werelions tended to follow many of the same behaviors that mundane lions did, which included having a culture of very open marriages to the males taking on the role as the pride&#39;s defenders and the females being the pride&#39;s hunters. Almost any attack on a pride member would surely lead to a response from the pride&#39;s males, and in this case, with it obvious that Peter and Karen were moving toward that day when they would at least become mates, if not engaged to be married, that Peter saw the stress that Karen was under because of the potential threat this agent posed as a threat to the pride and a key part of it for Peter. Leon was proud of his son for keeping his cool and for doing the responsible thing to keep Karen safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you and the college have made a wise choice,&quot; Leon said to his son, &quot;we&#39;ve seen how you&#39;ve been with Karen... It has been good to see and makes us happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we&#39;ll get the guest room ready and let the girls have their own heart to heart,&quot; Leon said to Peter, before the two men walked away from the entryway into the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll put on some tea and we can talk,&quot; Regina said to Karen as she lead her son&#39;s girlfriend to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Shortly after Karen found herself sitting in the Talbot living room with Regina. Regina sat by Karen and looked fairly calm toward the younger woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be safe here,&quot; Regina commented, &quot;neither Peter nor Leon would let anything happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Karen said as she nodded, &quot;I&#39;ve felt that... and you all have been so friendly, that I really do wish to be part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina sipped her tea, &quot;Well that is good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Karen agreed, &quot;it is... but it still has some concerns and worries...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t about werelion&#39;s open marriages?&quot; Regina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no it&#39;s not that,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;I&#39;m not necessarily eager for it... but so long as I&#39;m the one Peter sees as the most important, I can accept it. The thing I&#39;m more concerned about is what it&#39;s like to become a lioness...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Regina answered, &quot;well... regardless of whether one is born a were or becomes a were... it can be a very empowering experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Karen wondered, &quot;the first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can,&quot; Regina said slowly, &quot;though mostly because the body is going through physical changes that they aren&#39;t used to. That goes for both normals becoming weres and weres reaching the age in which they have their first transformation. It&#39;s one of the reasons sex ends up being something that helps... the pleasure and closeness...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the first transformation hurts?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more discomfort than it is outright pain,&quot; Regina replied, &quot;so... you shouldn&#39;t have that much to worry about while you and Peter are together. He will help you get through your first transformation and you will become a strong and beautiful lioness. After your first transformation, there is no pain at all. In fact... transforming becomes borderline arousing all on its own... to feel your muscle swell with power... your bosom heave with your inner lioness... your tail extend... once you&#39;ve had your first transformation, that process feels good and feels more like you&#39;re unleashing the REAL you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The real me?&quot; Karen asked, her voice sounding a little more eager than she wanted it to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Regina smiled and patted Karen&#39;s shoulder carefully, &quot;as a were... you&#39;ll feel your transformed state is closer to your real form... who and what you TRULY are. That your human form is merely a cover. At least that&#39;s the way I&#39;ve felt about it since my first transformation... but you won&#39;t lose anything in your personality that is truly yours. You gain certain things with regard to instincts, but they don&#39;t replace or dominate you... It&#39;s that allows the transformation to feel whole and powerful, because who you are doesn&#39;t disappear with the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Karen managed a smile and took a sip of her tea. She really wasn&#39;t much of a tea drinker, but she had to admit that the brand that Regina had brewed tasted rather good.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you and Peter getting close to taking that plunge?&quot; Regina asked, &quot;as your question is one that Peter asked a lot when his first transformation approached... and one that others that have wished to join werelion society have asked, though in more formal settings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we are,&quot; Karen smiled, &quot;Your son... he&#39;s been such a gentleman and so kind to me. I&#39;m really not seeing myself with anyone but him... on a permanent basis, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Regina smiled, &quot;though... I suppose the present issue with this Wilhelm character doesn&#39;t have you in the mood...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Karen nodded, &quot;thank you again... both you and Leon for letting me stay until things quiet down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re practically family, dear,&quot; Regina gave a warm smile, &quot;We&#39;ll always be there for you. Leon feels the same. You can have pride in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I think I will,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;but first we&#39;ll have to get through the wedding.&quot;</p>
