<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Aaaaa, this is great” lying here in the sun feeling it on all my body, I was just wearing nothing but a speedo what I have been wearing for 5 days now, just lazing around the house, and normally only having to put on a shirt or tank top on when my friends come around in the afternoon, what ends up with us playing in this big house’s pool, or in now my room playing the latest video games or just messing around. <br />
 <br />
thinking back this has been an amazing 4 weeks, this kid who I am now has it made, looking down at my small smooth body and smiling seeing I now have a much more noticeable olive tan, only wearing a red speedo what showed of a reasonably big lump on the front of them what I feel proud off oddly, and I stretched all my body, while lying there and sat up knowing I am going to have to think of more ways to get in to the lab, <br />
 <br />
I did not know what they were thinking, putting me in to this kids body expecting the dad of him now me to allow his son to go anywhere near the lab, and know everything that his dad is up to at any moment, or expect him to tell me everything he is doing with me being 11 year old boy now, I rarely see him in the day except 2h in the evenings and as a farther he a pretty good one, the kid inside me feels love for him and makes me happy and enjoy myself when he plays with me and jokes around with me, but every time I try and get him to let me come with him to his lab, he just tells me to be a good boy and stay with mom, and have fun away from the basement so I do. <br />
 <br />
I did try to follow him once he got pretty angry when one of his Garuds spotted me, and walked me out in front of him, so I need another idea to get in and find the serum, but that was like 2 days being here, I kind of just fulling in line now not being able to think of any other ways, and loving living like this, not having a care in the world, and find myself throwing myself into being this kid, feeling the need for people to do things for me, from making meals to deciding when I go to bed, what has not really been a problem, with me becoming a mummies boy like Ted said I would end up being, with every night me being in the sitting room, cubbly up next to the kids now my new mom and normally fall asleep with my head on her lap, and normally wake up with are butler Jefry, carrying me upstairs to my room, or putting me to bed, I do feel a attachment to her what I never felt to my own mother, and do not know what I am going to do once I have finished this mission I feel o want to stay like this and be with here, but there is no point in thinking about it now because I am happy right now, and there is no point in thinking about stuff what will bring me down. <br />
 <br />
And I have not had any wet dreams since I been here, something or I should say someone really did help with that, are maid “Mia” and she is a bombshell, well she is to this body anyway, big ass, perfect tits and amazing lips, well the first morning being here I woke up with a hard on, and this boy body, child/tween curiosity got best of me and I wanted to see myself necked with my dick pocking up, and that is what I did, I striped off my pjs and stood in front of the big mirror in now my room, and well it was the new young me with a ok sized dick stiff and pocking out. <br />
 <br />
I was playing with it not being able to just let it go, again being a tween it’s hard it just leave it, anyway feeling the hormones going throw my young body, being so young still being able to feel orgasms all around my body, but while I was doing this Mia the maid let herself in and looked at me naked playing with myself, she just smiled and said “your dad gave me intrusion when this day came, and don’t worry young master” and without saying another word she needled down and put my hard dick in to her mouth and began to give me the best blow job, I have ever had, I&#39;m pretty shore it was because of my age and this body being new to anything with sex involved. <br />
 <br />
But it is great she comes every morning to give me a BJ and it is just a perfect why to start the day at 8 am, I have gotten really used to it, and she also lets me play with her tits and experiment with her body, while she gives me a hand job once I am left in my room in the evening, she knows a secret passage what leads to my room what she using to get around and not be seen to sneak in to my room at night, she says that my dad commanded her to do it to me and it was part of her interview to do so, so I don’t feel bad for it, and she seems to enjoy it, so yer my hormones are very controlled and happy now because of her. <br />
 <br />
And I love being able to just lie here and relax doing nothing, an till around 12 and that is when Andrea, Mattia and Tommaso (my now childhood friends) will be around and then it is full on, pushing each other, play fighting, pulling each other swim suits/speedos down to embarrass each other, constant silly jokes and challenging each other to show off, it’s all surprisingly amazingly fun and this happens everyday and so far it has not got old or boring yet, and well Mattia (my closes friend) looks at me in a certain way what excites me inside, he is one year older than me and I find him hot, with his muscular body and long blonde hair what reminds me of mine now, but I don’t know why he does, because I also find Mia attractive and when she lets me touch her it’s great, but with Mattia it’s different I am too scared to say anything about it to anyone or act on the feelings I feel not wanting to get rejected, and well it is new, so  this must be bi, and in my old adult body I was a straight man and I slept with too many woman and never felt any attachment to any of them, I was kind of a dick now thinking about it, but I have never felt attachment to someone like this, I have been pushing it to the back of my mind, not acting on it, and been treating him like the friend he has always been to me, well to the new me “Luca”. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
anyway me lying in this worm sun I knew it was not what I supposed to be doing and that the person I think who is my dad now is going to hurt a lot of people, so I will have to stop him, and hopefully he will come peacefully, once I took what I needed, feeling like he is my real farther and not wanting anything bad to happing to him, I am trying to fight these feelings, what are trying to tell me that he is my dad and a nice person and can’t be a bady, trying to think like the spy I use to be, but this kids feelings and body is hard to constantly fight it, and it is just easier to lie down here and relax feeling like the rich 11 year old boy I am now. <br />
 <br />
While I was relaxing thinking of all of this, I heard a shout “YO LUCA, WE’ER HERE!!” I knew straight away it was Mattia and my over two friends are here and the fun is going start, so I quickly stood up and put on a button shirt loosely (not doing the buttons up, leaving my belly and chest on show, and leaving my lags bear only having a speedo on) and run towards my friends ready to have a fun afternoon. and thinking “i will work on a way to get in to dad&#39;s lab later, right now all I want to do is have fun with my best friends, will see if maybe they can help me, or have any ideas?</p>
