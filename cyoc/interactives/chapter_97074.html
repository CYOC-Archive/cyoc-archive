<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing there, in the middle of everything that was going on, where everything was going wrong and not one bit of it made a lick of sense, Nate wondered what he was going to do. He wanted to be a werewolf, not a werefox, but now that choice was stripped from him. His father, also a werefox, had been pulled out of that witch Yvette’s spell by his desire to protect his only son… a son which he cared about in ways Nate had only dreamed of. He knew it was wrong, but he couldn’t help thinking about his father and him having sex together. Sure, now they could, but the cost was the rest of his family. His mother and sister were both gone, seemingly out of the picture and that’s not what Nate wanted. His hope was that the trouble his family had gone through would be wiped clean, allowing them to start over in a new life and most importantly… to remain together as a strong family unit. However, as fate would have it, things don’t really ever get wiped completely clean and they never change.<br />
<br />
As the last bit of the transformation into the werefox consumed him, Nate felt a massive jolt from nowhere. He wondered, immediately, if his body was going through some sort of full body muscle spasm from the change. He even wondered if the lithe form that he had as the fox would get bulkier to fit his wanton desires, but the spasm came again and this time it was enough to spring him into the air. A third jolt actually caused him physical pain, yet suddenly he was in a different place altogether. Looking around, checking out his surroundings, Nate found himself in the front passenger seat, his father driving and all of their stuff loaded in the car behind his seat and in the trunk.<br />
<br />
“Wha-what’s going on?” Nate asked in confusion, unaware of what was really happening and still trying to make sense of it all.<br />
<br />
“Oh hey there Nate, glad to see you are awake and with me again!” His father William said with a big smile on his clean shaven face.<br />
<br />
“Awake?” Nate asked again, confused since what was apparently a dream had been so real.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… awake… you… do know what that means? On the ride to Moon Lake you fell asleep. Can’t say that I blame you either considering I was being lulled to sleep myself. Thankfully that last stop  you and I made where I got myself an energy drink really helped to keep me awake and alert. So… since we are almost there… are you ready to start our new lives here just the two of us?” William asked, still smiling from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
“J-just the two of us?” Nate questioned under his breath, but as he was waking up, so too did the fog of sleep leave him.<br />
<br />
It was becoming clearer to him now. the dream was his mind trying to bring his estranged family back together. His mother Martha got custody of his brother Eric and William got Nate. Nate didn’t like the fact that his mother and father split, tearing their family right in half, but such was the way of the world. It had been five years since Nate or William had contact with either Martha, Eric or even both. Nate couldn’t help wondering how they were doing… they were his kin after all, but he assumed that his father may have had questions about his daughter, but not Martha. There was still a nasty taste in his mouth, even after all this time and he was happy to have everything just the way that it was. The thing was, Nate couldn’t get over how real his own brain made the dream, but he should have known it was because it didn’t make any sense. He knew that there was no hope of his family getting back together especially because of the move they were actually in at that moment. Maybe the dream was even his mind trying to hold onto something that was, but actually isn’t. He thought to himself as Nate’s mind reeled and began to run around in circles.<br />
<br />
Now… now they were near their new town, their new home and most importantly their new life. Nate couldn’t help but to wonder if the town was going to be the way that it was in the dream. Would the town be a town of weres? Would there be a werewolf to turn him? Would there be a pack of werewolves to create a new, unbreakable family? Nate wondered silently as he was getting anxious, excited and sexually aroused. The bit in his dream, looking at a were-porn magazine full of male anthros, was definitely something his mind made physical because of his love of looking at all the art on the Internet. It didn’t matter to him if it was pornographic or not… to him art was art. Though, he also couldn’t deny that furry pornography turned him on far more than human and Nate couldn’t deny that he found himself stroking his average sized cut cock. Nate even wondered if William would turn out to be gay and have incestuous feelings for him as he had for his father. He also couldn’t help it because William was a fine specimen of a man. William was well muscled, moderately hairy, gorgeous green eyes, a chiseled square jaw, perfect white teeth, an infectiously warm smile and all of the inner qualities of the perfect guy. William had a great personality, sense of humor, well-rounded, well-mannered, masculine while not afraid to admit he had a feminine side like all men had… whether they’d admit to it or not… it was there.<br />
<br />
“So champ, are you excited to start our new lives?” William asked, breaking the silence from Nate’s internal thinking.<br />
<br />
“Oh… yeah… I am really excited! Though…” he said with a pause, “one can’t ever truly start over or wipe the slate clean… can they?” Nate asked his dad genuinely.<br />
<br />
William frowned, knowing that his son had a point to his words. “No son… you cannot. All we can ever do is reinvent ourselves and move on from the events of the past.” William answered in honesty. <br />
<br />
While he was still driving, William couldn’t help reminiscing about the moment his life when he finally took a stand to live as he should. With what Martha put him through, when she was just as guilty of doing, that she didn’t like and said was ‘wrong’ and ‘unnatural’... was more than infuriating… it was despicable! It was infuriating to him still because she was being a hypocrite. It was one night that William was supposed to work late and ended up getting out earlier than expected, that he came home to find Martha in bed with another person. When William demanded to know who was under the sheets because she didn’t want him to see, he ripped the sheets right off the bed and saw that she was having relations with another woman! She made him go through gay to straight gay conversion therapy where they practically brainwashed a person into behaving how those giving the therapy thought men and women should. She forced him into being a person that he wasn’t and then she turned around and did that! That ended their marriage right then and there. William had been living an unhappy life and lie for so long that the moment her own lie was exposed, he wasn’t going to live it any longer. Nate and William had been on their own ever since. Thankfully, William always had a decent job with great pay to be able to afford to live comfortably. It wasn’t anything super fancy or opulent… it was all middle of the road stuff. Though, at the same time, if Nate really wanted something William would just buy it for him as a gift.<br />
<br />
Hearing his father’s words, Nate frowned, but then a thought popped into his younger mind. “While we can’t start over, we can start fresh somewhere new where there was no old negativity to corrupt it.”<br />
<br />
William looked over to his son, smiling that warm smile of his and said, “That’s the spirit buddy!” The comment Nate made rose William’s spirits up just loving how positively thinking Nate was.<br />
<br />
“So dad… how much longer till we get to Moon Lake?” Nate asked, changing the subject to keep his dad’s mind off of the depressing bullshit that seemed to be pulling him down.<br />
<br />
“Oh… not long now. I’d say maybe five minutes or so?” His father said unsure.<br />
<br />
As soon as William said that, he noticed a large crowd of people blocking the road and he began to slow down so he didn’t have to slam on his breaks or plow through the citizens of Moon Lake. Among them were many faces that Nate knew, somehow before hand, through his dream. There was Samantha, the town chancellor; Ben, her son and a werewolf; Frances, Samantha’s lover… but among them was one face that was definitely unexpected and quite honestly shocking. Thinking he was seeing things, Nate rubbed his eyes and leaned forward while squinting to try and bring more focus to his vision. Once Nate’s hands were clear of his eyes, Nate tapped his dad on the shoulder while the car slowed all the way to a complete stop.<br />
<br />
“What is it Nate?” William asked with his son just pointing to the person he thought he saw standing there, but for him to be would be impossible. <br />
<br />
“Dad…” Nate was finally able to say after the complete shock of it all… “Is… is that Eric standing there with the sharply dressed woman’s deft hands resting against his shoulders.”<br />
<br />
William squinted training his eyes on the person Nate described and said:</p>
