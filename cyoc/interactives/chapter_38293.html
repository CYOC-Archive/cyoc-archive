<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you lay there looking at the ceiling of the alcove, the truth hits you, 'This is a task,' a <br />
duty you had to perform for the greater good of your race, any emotions or pleasure that <br />
come along because of that are just icing on the cake. Yellow Fox really seemed like a nice <br />
guy, and you're happy that he was able to fill you in more, but you now realize it'll be <br />
unlikely to pursue a relationship with him, after all, he belonged to any Magni female who <br />
decided he was good stock. You wonder if you should have gone with Red Lion after all <br />
but toss that thought aside. She wouldn't help a jerk like that pass on his traits to the next <br />
generation. <br />
<br />
Getting up, having a mental image of checking a mark off a clip board, you leave the <br />
alcove and walk back into the mating area, your are surprised at the feeling of satisfaction <br />
and happiness for Yellow Fox you feel when you see another female has already chosen <br />
him, you realize it's the pink skunk who used to be the gorgeous blond from before. You <br />
shake your head slightly, 'Who she was before doesn't matter, that's in the past and let it <br />
stay in the past.' <br />
<br />
You honestly feel relieved by Yellow Fox's news that you old body doesn't exist anymore. <br />
You feel yourself over, every curve, every shape, you've never felt so free. You look at the <br />
organized chaos that is the rainbow sherbet of various suitors gathering prospective <br />
female, each one wanting to be chosen. <br />
<br />
You wonder about trying the green wolverine, but decide to come back for him if he's <br />
available. You spot the blue hedgehog from before and decide to help him along. He isn't <br />
trying to win another female yet, and you hope you haven't damaged his confidence by <br />
accident. Swaying up to him you tap him on the shoulder, he looked surprised to see you, <br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; He sounds like he's wondering if you've come to rub it in, instead you just say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Want to help make some Magno?&quot; You ask in a perky tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a Magno?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The embryo state of the Magni.&quot; You explain. <br />
<br />
“Oh.” She says, then “Oh! Yes, yes I would!”<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you might,&quot; You purr. 'Am I supposed to go to the egg chamber after I've <br />
marked off six males?' You wonder, 'Then again, if Steve returns to cause trouble, it might <br />
not even matter. You shudder, 'I won't have my magno be wasted. The voice said we'll have <br />
to establish a nest somewhere else, so I'm guess I'll likely lay my birthing sac there.' <br />
<br />
That was when a very odd thought occurred to you, 'I wonder... what female produced my <br />
birthing sac? And what male did she couple with to produce my Magno? Did they used to <br />
be human? Or was I put into one of the birthing sacs left over from Sixty five million years <br />
ago?' You wonder if it technically even matters who your new parents are. But still the <br />
curiosity won't leave you, part of being cat you guess. 'If I think about it again, maybe I'll <br />
try and find out.' You decide as you led the blue hedgehog along. <br />
<br />
It surprises yet amuses you how clueless he is about how to begin unlike Yellow Fox, you <br />
wonder if he was a geek in his former life, but another thought does occur to you. &quot;You <br />
used to be female right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how did you guess?&quot; He stutters. <br />
<br />
&quot;My last partner showed a bit more know how than you, no, please, don't take that <br />
personally. The gender of the Magni is decided by the gender of the magno that birthed it, <br />
it's as random as any birth, has happened to a lot of people here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you... did you used to be...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Male? Yep! But that doesn't matter anymore. Just like you being female before doesn't <br />
matter, the you that exists now is the one that matters, and I want you, inside me.&quot; You <br />
take hold of his hips and press them against you, and look into his eyes, &quot;And I know... <br />
that you want to be inside me too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Blue Hedgehog stutters for a bit more, then finally relaxes, and you pull down onto you. <br />
Any doubts or fears he might have had already gone out the window. You ultimately come <br />
out on top, his quills aren't as sharp as knives as you were first worried they'd be. Having <br />
more experience at his end of things than he does, you lead him through it, knowing how <br />
to turn him on. <br />
<br />
Finally several minutes later Blue Hedgehog leaves your alcove, but not before saying, <br />
&quot;Thank you. So what now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you.&quot; You say checking off another mark on the mental clip board. &quot;And you <br />
should go back to the procreation chamber for another female to pick you, don't worry, be <br />
nice and I'm sure you'll do fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Blue Hedgehog nodded and hurried along. <br />
<br />
Poking your head out of your alcove, you see Yellow Fox leaving Pink Skunk's alcove. You <br />
wonder how many females he's been with. Then again he did say he was only a few hours <br />
old. Still, you can't help the idea that you could be just one of two dozen or even more so, <br />
like sultan's a harem. Ugh. Still, you knew he was just doing what he had to do like you. <br />
But that still didn't mean you couldn't try. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey pretty thing!&quot; You said to Pink Skunk, who turns her head and look at you too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Do I know you? Have I seen you before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw! And yep! I saw you put into an egg just before I was. I gotta say as a human you <br />
were good looking, as a Magni you're something else!&quot; You both giggle at the <br />
idiosyncrasy. &quot;So which one on you on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just had my second, you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto! You picked anyone yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, still resting you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have someone in mind, in fact, come with me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Leaving your alcove a bit early and you know it as your feel wobble for a bit, you help up <br />
Pink Skunk too and lead her along. Neither you or Pink Skunk -look- pregnant, 'Hmm... I <br />
wonder, I wonder what our development period for our eggs are after we've had our sixth <br />
male... no way to know unless I find someone in the know. I wonder how long I was in my <br />
birthing sac for. It could have been years or minutes and I wouldn't have been able to tell <br />
the difference. It's not like any of us are wearing digital watches.... or anything for that <br />
matter! Tee-hee!' <br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, I have an idea for making this more interesting.&quot; You say as sly as any cat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The naked, pink, rubber skunk woman asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll both have three more to go after this, how about we share partners? It'll make things <br />
interesting, and if one of them is a total loser, one of us will be able to know ahead of <br />
time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; She nods, &quot;Sounds like fun!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And ta-da!&quot; You found your quarry and quickly tapped him on the shoulder and stepped <br />
back and gave Pink Skunk a slight push. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh excuse me.&quot; Said Blue Hedgehog. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Says Pink Skunk, &quot;Pink Cat implies you're not all that bad, want to help me find out <br />
for myself?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blue Hedgehog only nods but with more confidence than last time and Pink Skunk lead <br />
him back to alcove. <br />
<br />
You scan the room and find who you want. He seems to be looking for another 'selection' <br />
to start, which was very often. You ignore the other males who are trying to show off to <br />
you but make note of them. <br />
<br />
You touch his bare hip getting his attention and he looks surprised to see you. &quot;Yes <br />
Madam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You serviced Pink Skunk, I wish for you to service me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you her friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but I hope to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Without hesitation or a second thought the green wolverine bowed his head, &quot;As you <br />
command Madam.&quot; He said obediently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good doggie, now come along.&quot; Like all the male Magni you've seen, his equipment is <br />
perfectly protected and hidden when not in use, making him almost appear genderless. <br />
<br />
Finding Blue Hedgehog and Pink Skunk are already enjoying each other, you help the <br />
green wolverine into your own alcove and you begin.</p>
