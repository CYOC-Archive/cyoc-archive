<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The... Naga?&quot; She scratched the back of her head. &quot;That&#39;s like... those are snake people, right? Normal person up top, tail instead of legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth nodded. &quot;They dwell in an arid region of the island, to the south of where your boat crashed. If she was taken by them...&quot; The blonde&#39;s shoulders dropped slightly. &quot;They would not permit her to stay long, if she did not commit to become like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
A loud snort left the redhead&#39;s mouth. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t think she&#39;d need much convincing.&quot; Melody was a bit of a reptile freak - she absolutely adored anything scaly. While other kids kept dogs and cats for pets, Melody had been maintaining snakes, lizards, iguanas, anything that was vaguely reptilian. More than once she&#39;d shared idle fantasies about what it would be like to slither through the grass like a snake. &quot;If there&#39;s a bunch of snake people on this island, Melody&#39;s probably found them, and probably begged them to make her into one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well, that is comforting, at least.&quot; She smiled slightly. &quot;If you&#39;d like to go and check, we can head to the tribe&#39;s border, and perform the necessecary ritual immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... we better get a move on.&quot; She let out a resolute sigh. There was such an exciting festival outside, filled with so many beautiful girls that she&#39;d love to explore all her newfound sapphic desires with. But... Melody was more important than her own little selfish pleasures. At the very least, she had to make sure that silly snake freak was okay - though if she&#39;d been turned into one of these naga people, she was probably over the moon. At least her shipwreck might have helped one friend find some happiness, she supposed.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of wanting stares as she headed into the woods with Elizabeth, her eyes lingering on various feminine assets among the increasingly distant crowd of partying guards and attendants. It was a bit mind-boggling to realize that twenty-four hours ago, she&#39;d never even considered anything romantic or sexual with another woman. For a moment she wondered, had the magic done something to alter her mind, her preferences, what she desired? Or had there always been some spark, something that she kept suppressed, until the magnificence of her changed body brought it to the forefront?<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my Lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you came here, were you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Attracted to women?&quot; Her soft giggles filled the otherwise quiet forest as they walked. &quot;No, I&#39;d never felt such things before. I assume you did not, either?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head. &quot;So, what... the magic here, it... makes you gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... yes, I would say it does make most of the inhabitants quite happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah. Right. Old timey definitions. &quot;Er. No. Uh... where I come from... when I come from, I guess... gay, it&#39;s slag for being homosexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Why, that sounds lovely.&quot; She turned briefly to grin at Cassandra. &quot;It sounds like such things have become accepted, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;Depends on where you go. But uh... anyway... the island, the magic on it. It... makes you feel that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they spoke, they had come to a small creek winding through the forest, and Elizabeth paused to reach down and collect some water from it. &quot;Oh, not at all. The magic can&#39;t alter a mind in such a way. Bodies, they are but playthings to be shaped at the whim of mystical forces - but a mind is a far more hardened thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure? &#39;Cause uh... I was straight as an arrow before I came here, and now...&quot; She didn&#39;t need to complete the sentence. The way she was staring at Elizabeth&#39;s chest as she turned back to the amazon was quite enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;And had you ever seen such beauty in the human form, as you&#39;ve now witnessed among myself, and the other women of the temple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... god no, you&#39;re all way, way above any woman I ever saw.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you have your answer.&quot; She reached up and caressed one of Cassandra&#39;s cheeks, instantly causing it to blush. &quot;The world trains us to make assumptions about what we desire, to conform to labels. Sometimes, you must be overwhelmed with the beauty of something to realize how silly such things are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh... I don&#39;t follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. The Protector should be a leader, not a follower.&quot;<br />
<br />
She made a fake laugh as Elizabeth pulled away, leaving the amazon to stew on her words as they continued walking. The trees were beginning to thin out, extensive bushes and underbrush being replaced by dried grasslands, and eventually, spilling out to a sweeping golden plain. She could feel the relative lack of moisture in the air, and the rise in heat - odd for an island, she had to admit, but this was a magical place. She supposed it didn&#39;t have to obey natural laws.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is as far as I am permitted,&quot; the blonde announced, &quot;And as far as you may go in your current state. Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;So uh, when I&#39;m done here, I just... slither back to the temple, and you&#39;ll change me back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth gave her a small nod, already busy with humming to herself and moving her hands in all sorts of strange, oddly specific pattern. &quot;Of course. Now please, my Lady, if you&#39;ll hold still...&quot;<br />
<br />
As she began to chant in some language that Cassandra had no hope of recognizing, sparks began to appear from her fingers, eventually bursting into bands of light that began to dance between her hands. Standing still as she could manage, the redhead watched as the dazzling lightshow began to form into patterns, shapes, odd geometric sigils that floated in her direction. She winced, half-expecting that this was going to hurt, but there was no such pain when the first glowing symbols touched her legs.<br />
<br />
Just... an odd sort of warmth. A quickly familiar sensation, albeit far less intense than what she&#39;d experienced during her first transformation, began to spread from every point that the sigils touched. Her breaths quickened ever so slightly as she felt her legs heat up, and subsequently, a great heat in what lay between her legs. Elizabeth seemed to flash a smile as she noted the effects on Cassandra, but kept performing her ritual dutifully, the chanting not once stopping or pausing.<br />
<br />
Alarm spread through her as she realized her legs were... shrinking? She was confused, weren&#39;t they supposed to become a tail... oh god. She moaned loudly as she felt a pressure at the end of her spine, her tailbone lengthening out at a rapid pace. Tail bone - it made sense in a way. She finally looked back from the blonde to find that the pressure had already pulled a tail as long as her arm from just above her behind, and it was only getting longer and thicker by the moment.<br />
<br />
In seconds it was as large around as her hips at its base, seeming to taper slightly from there as its length simply exploded. Still covered in the same flesh as her skin, she could already feel its powerful muscles rippling, contracting and expanding as she was rapidly forced to acclimate to the weight. She fell backwards, but found it remarkably easy to stand herself up on the now-coiling tail - a handy thing, as her legs were now receding into almost nothing, merging seamlessly into the flesh of her new, singular limb. All that remained was her shapely behind, still posessing a pair of pleasant cheeks, and a mercifully-preserved womahood that was growing warmer with every inch the tail gained.<br />
<br />
The length seemed to finally top out at what must have been twenty feet, an absolutely massive mess of muscle and skin that thinned to a fine point. The lack of pressure was only momentary, as she felt an explosion of renewed heat across the entire limb. From a thousand points on her tail, scales dug their way out of her flesh, golden and glinting in the midday sun. They were soft to the touch, delightfully so, their beauty enhanced by the silver patches that created a network of diamond patterns all over the tail. <br />
<br />
She had thought this to be the final change, but there was one more thing in store. The burning shot up suddenly to her face, and in her jaw, she could feel her canines rocketing out, lengthing into fangs. Her tongue burned, aching as it was stretched out, emerging from her mouth as a long, forked thing, hissing into the air. Her eyes opened wide with fire as she watched the world shift in her vision, the natural colors momentarily replaced with the glows of infrared vision. She squinted, finding she could easily switch between normal and infrared at will - and looked down at a creek to find a pair of slitted golden eyes staring back at her.<br />
<br />
From the waist up, she was still human, facial alterations aside. But below that, with the transition hidden by her leather skirt, was the form of a massive snake. The sensations that came from her powerful, long tail... they were nearly overwhelming. So much flesh, so much of herself that she could move and feel. She coiled herself up, twisting on her tail to look at Elizabeth. She didn&#39;t need infrared vision to detect the heat of arousal on the succubus.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ritual is complete, my Lady.&quot; She paused, taking in a deep breath. &quot;This form... you take to it nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessssss... I think I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
She raised an eyebrow. &quot;I know for a fact, my Lady, that you don&#39;t have to hiss like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. Had to do it.&quot; She winked. &quot;So... out into the plains, I guess. Any idea where I should start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Naga village is to the west - you should be able to find it quite easily. You could also check some of the caves, closer to the shoreline - and I&#39;m sure if you simply wandered, one of their patrols would find you eventually.&quot; She clasped her hands together, and Cassandra couldn&#39;t help but notice she was pushing her chest out. &quot;Is there anything else before you depart, my Lady?&quot;</p>
