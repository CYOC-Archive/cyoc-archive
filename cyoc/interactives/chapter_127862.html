<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the good time the girls were having it was beginning to get late. At 21 curfew wasn&#39;t an issue but at 16 it could cause major problems. Deciding to play it safe the girls made their way back to the car and drove home. Although Kellie was initially worried about driving after drinking Claudia assured her it would be ok, it had been an hour since they had taken thwir shots.<br />
<br />
As the girls pulled into Katie&#39;s driveway Claudia sent a text message to her parents saying she was dropping everyone off and would be home soon. &quot;Well that was a fun night,&quot; Mika said with a grin. The others nodded in agreement as Katie and Kellie exited the car. &quot;Absolutely we got to do this again soon,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;Definitely, &quot; Claudia said. &quot;Just one last thing,&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie blushed slightly realizing the girls were still 21. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she blushed. Looking at the ring Katie wished for the girls to become 16 again. Quickly the girls retreated into their teens, their breasts losing their fullness and become perky. The gurls watchrd in slight dismay as their curves receded and their faves became less mature. Claudia and Mika frowned as they shrank slightly, returning to their original heights. &quot;Ugh this is going to be a long five years,&quot; Claudia sighed before chuckling. Saying their goodbyes Claudia and Mika were about to pullout when three cars pulled in behind them. Curious the four girls stared as Lisa, Kumiko and Shiro exited their cars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kumi,&quot; Lisa called. &quot;Can you get your nephew in the house with these two.&quot; The girls watched as Lisa opened the backdoor, letting Ashley and Jennifer out. Kumiko nodded as she glared at Shiro. Shiro seemed angry but helped escort a drunk Ashley and embarassed Jennifer into the house. Lisa turned to the girls sighing. &quot;Hi,&quot; she said, somewhat flustered. &quot;I&#39;ve had a hell of a night. Please tell me you four didn&#39;t fo anything stupid.&quot; The girls shoom their heads no saying they just went to dinner and saw a movie. Satisfied with that answer Lisa watched Jennifer helped her drunk friend into the house. With Kumiko and the others out of earshot she turned again. &quot;So no b.s. with that ring right?&quot; She asked. &quot;Anything you four did you made normal right because I REALLY dont want to deal with anymore teenage drama than I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika looked somewhat flabbergasted by this while the others shook their heads no. &quot;No mom,&quot; Katie said. &quot;We didn&#39;t mess around much and everything as back to normal.&quot; Lisa loomed at the girls with a critical eye. Satisfied she sighed. &quot;Thank god,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Listen this may take a few so I dont think I&#39;ll be able to move the cars. Claudia I&#39;ll tell yout folks your here so they won&#39;t be mad. Oh and Mika, judging by your reaction I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t know I knew about the ring, well I do. Kumiko doesn&#39;t though so if we could PLEASE keep quiet about it I&#39;d appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding silently the girls followed Lisa into the house. As they entered they saw everyone else in the living room. Kumiko was currently yelling at Shiro. Not only about picking up underage girls bit about what he said to Mika and her friends. Shiro looked angry but remained silent, hanging his head slightly.  Ashley and Jennifer were sitting on the couch. Ashley looked like she was going to be sick, a trashcan between her legs while Jennifer blushed furiously. Jennifer looked somewhat embarassed as she now tried to comfort her friend. Looming up at the front door the gJennifer turned a deeper shade of red while Shiro&#39;s eyes flared in rage and horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen you two,&quot; Lisa sighed looking at Ashley and Jennifer. &quot;Just........stay here, while I try to figure out what to do with you.&quot; The girls nodded sheepishly in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for you,&quot; Kumiko growled. &quot;You better apologize to your sister or I&#39;m telling your parents about your dating habits. You kniw damn well they won&#39;t be thrilled.&quot; Shiro opened his mouth before closing it and nodding. Sighing Kumiko now joined Lisa in the kitchen, leaving Katie and her friends alone with Shiro, Ashley and Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;So all that bullshit about white girls and I you try to date TWO underage ones,&quot; Mika growled. Shiro fumed turning an ugly shade of red. &quot;Look,&quot; he growled. &quot;I didn&#39;t know they were underage okay. I&#39;ve run into them at the club the last couple of weekends. I thought they were going to the community college so....&quot; He trailed off as he looked at Katie. &quot;Is this the witches home,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
Katie nodded. &quot;Yeah it&#39;s mine,&quot; she murmured. &quot;And don&#39;t call me a witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine sorceress or is their something else you go by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Mika yelled. &quot;Nows not the time and shes sorry okay. It was an accident and it only happened because of all that crap you said about Claudia and Kellie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro nodded stiffly still warily looking at Katie. &quot;Fine,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Just don&#39;t turm me into a toad or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you two,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;What the hell?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley looked up, about to answer before throwing up into the trashcan. Jennifer sighed rubbing her friends back. &quot;I know were idiots,&quot; she moaned. &quot;We&#39;ve been sneaking in the last couple of weeks. We met Shiro and he was cute and willing to buy us drinks. Don&#39;t be mad at him though, we never told him we were 16.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro groaned as Ashley threw up again. Katie gazed at her &quot;frenemies&quot; trying to make sense of the situation. &quot;So you and Ash aren&#39;t a couple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT NO!!!&quot; Ashley exclaimed. &quot;We&#39;re besties but were not into eachother like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know Shiro is a homoohobe and hates white people?&quot; Mika growled.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared dumbfoumded at Shiro as he rubbed his temple.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t hate white people,&quot; he groaned. &quot;I was....I was, just angry okay....sorry, ugh damn it I&#39;m an idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shiro,&quot; Jennifer fumed. &quot;Why did you even hit on us if you felt like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro shot daggers at Jennifer before answering. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you mention you were 16.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them now stared in silence as Ashley began puking again. Katie sighed as she rubbed her eyes. &quot;Okay listen,&quot; she said. &quot;I think all of us of had issues with one another recently. I say we have a do over, start fresh with a clean slate. Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro and Jennifer nodded as Ashley deunkenly held a thumbs up, her head still buried in the trashcan. Sighing Katie rubbed her eyes. &quot;Okay,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Heres the deal. Shiro goes home and if Lisa allows it Ashley and Jennifer crash here to stay out of trouble.  Tomorrow we start fresh so no more crap and Shiro please try to talk some sense into your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro looked the girls over before nodding. &quot;I can live with that,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;I&#39;m just going to ask Kumiko if I can go, shes real pissed about me buying them drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Shiro,&quot; Katie said meekly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about what happened.  I really am.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls nodded as Shiro went to talk with Kumiko leaving them alone with Ashley and Jennifer. Katie hoped she could now convince Lisa to let the girls stay over.</p>
