<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Smile!&quot;<br />
<br />
*Smile*<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
&quot;And turn to the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wind almost made her skirt flutter upwards like Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
&quot;Now turn to the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The curves of her buttocks looked best in this profile.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
&quot;Straight ahead one more time.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pouted in mild annoyance.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. Great pix, Carly. Thumbs up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody please kill me&quot; thought Carl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today, buster&quot; thought Wendy, staring right back at her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so used right now&quot; he shot right back at his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get used to it. Soon ten million people are going to be ogling and scrutinizing us every single day of the <br />
week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl and Wendy's telepathic conversations had taken some getting used to, but they had gotten the hang of it <br />
through practice and were now bickering inside their own heads the same as they always did before out loud. <br />
Wendy was off to the side of the young but skilled photographer, and standing behind her were several network <br />
people making sure that the two twin siblings weren't communicating with one another through hand gestures or <br />
any other kind of code speak. If they only knew.<br />
<br />
Both Carly and Wendy were dressed identically, wearing matching deep purple tops and black wraparound skirts, <br />
and some Jimmy Choos on their feet. Their faces were made up to perfection, accentuating their natural beauty. <br />
The photo shoot had gone well so far. It was 11:30 A.M, and two-thirds of the photos were already taken. <br />
Earlier in the day, Wendy had taken her own photos, where she was asked to pose somewhat more seductively than <br />
Carl was, which led Wendy to speculate that her &quot;character&quot; would be the more naughty twin on the broadcast <br />
while Carly was the more &quot;innocent&quot; one. When she told Carl that, he said that it sounded like they were <br />
starring in a porno.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, we are&quot; she said. &quot;In the anime community, it's called fan service.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl rolled his eyes again just as another flash of the camera went off, signaling the end of the session.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Carly. Just stand right there. Wendy,now it's time to rejoin your sister for the group photos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy and Carl spent the next forty-five minutes posing together, sometimes standing parallel to one another, <br />
sometimes back to back, their completely symmetrical butts touching each other through the skirt fabric. <br />
<br />
Just feeling his own wife's body made Carl aroused, but instead of feeling it in his non-existent penis, he <br />
was now feeling it everywhere throughout his very female body. It was a somewhat bizarre experience, but at <br />
least it wasn't as embarrassing as that topless swimming contest in Vegas that he had suffered through a month <br />
ago.<br />
<br />
Several takes were done of these pictures, and when that was done with, they were informed that the video <br />
portion would begin soon. They would have to record a few cheesy one liners that would air at the beginning of <br />
the first episode as well as some TV spots.<br />
<br />
While they waited for the staff to get ready, Carl and Wendy were now allowed to talk to each other except for <br />
anything game related, which was verboten. <br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you so much during the isolation&quot; said Carl. &quot;You wouldn't believe the things I had to do to get <br />
these guy's attention. Pfft. Never in a million years did I think I'd be doing any of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, hun. But we should probably stop talking until the suits vamoose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; agreed Carl. &quot;It's just that I haven't used my vocal cords in so long. They needed some exercise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for doing this, Carl.&quot; She had whispered the last part, leading one of the suits, a large man <br />
with a crew cut, to intervene on behalf of the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Save it for the show, ladies. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite his hulking appearance, he had a soft and gentle voice, and Carl and Wendy reciprocated his request. <br />
Then they waited.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Listed on the application for both twins were Wendy's parents, June and Julius, who had been flown out to Los <br />
Angeles to do a thirty-second bit where Carly and Wendy officially get their &quot;key&quot;s to enter the Big Brother <br />
house. The introductions of all the contestants and their families was one of Wendy's favorite parts of the <br />
show on TV, corny as it was, and she was honestly psyched to be doing it now for real. Once her folks got off <br />
the plane and were driven to meet her and Carl, Wendy wished for her parents to remember her being in her <br />
early twenties instead of her late thirties like she been but a month before, and that she had a twin sister <br />
named Carly. After a quick change of clothing for the girls, all four were moved to a small house in South <br />
Pasadena(the same location where the first Halloween movie was filmed), and given not quite a script, but a <br />
set of cues. Carly and Wendy were both asked to be super-enthusiastic about going on Big Brother and for their <br />
parents to be supportive. The doorbell would ring, and two envelopes stuffed with an oversized plastic key <br />
with their names on it would be given to them by a member of the production. Wendy's wish had made her parents <br />
supportive of her and Carl's endeavor anyway, so it was all quite redundant, but all four people put on a good <br />
show for the cameras and were done with it faster than they had realized. Carl had never quite gotten along <br />
with Wendy's parents, being seriously annoyed with his nagging mother-in-law(insert cliched joke here), and <br />
somewhat intimidated by her demanding father, but their new memories of Carly made them affectionate and <br />
loving towards their temporary new daughter. Play-acting was kind of fun, Carl had to admit, and he was at <br />
least a little used to Carly's female proportions now, so it wasn't as traumatizing as it would have been when <br />
Wendy first turned him into her sister.<br />
<br />
Jon showed up on set after the key segment, and asked Wendy and Carly how things were going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; shouted Wendy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, great&quot; answered Carly, not amused.<br />
<br />
Jon looked over at Carly and smiled.<br />
<br />
He introduced himself to June and Julius, and the five of them had a late lunch together. Carl had to remember <br />
to eat lighter to as not ruin his figure, but Wendy told him to go ahead and chow down since she could just <br />
wish all the unwanted weight away. The parents were skeptical of this man and his intentions towards their <br />
daughters, but he managed to ooze his way out of the awkwardness, the slick guy that he was. Wendy asked if <br />
all the contestants had been treated this well, and Jon said &quot;Nope. Only you two. You two caught my eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made both Carl and Wendy somewhat suspicious as well as curious, but they brushed it off once the <br />
waitress came back with their orders.<br />
<br />
Once lunch was through, June and Julius were given a fond farewell by Wendy and Carl(y) and given two checks <br />
by Jon to compensate for their inconvenient flight to L.A. Carl and Wendy were then driven to the famous <br />
Hollywood sign in order to record their sound bytes. Being listed as aspiring actresses, being in front of the <br />
Hollywood sign seemed only appropriate to the production staff. Carl and Wendy were told to spout silly lines <br />
like &quot;I'm Carly, but you can call me trouble&quot; and &quot;I'm Wendy, and if I piss you off, frankly I don't give a <br />
damn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Telepathically, Wendy teased Carl a little bit more by actually calling him &quot;Trouble&quot;, and Carl reminded her <br />
to cut out this psychic shit out once they got inside the BB house. Wendy agreed, and suddenly the <br />
supernatural transmission between them voluntarily was cut off.<br />
<br />
Now that they were all done for the day, Carl and Wendy were driven back to the hotel, ushered into their <br />
rooms like cattle, and asked politely but firmly to wait a few more days until the show began.<br />
<br />
Carl decided to order a steak and a movie, and relaxed for the rest of the evening.</p>
