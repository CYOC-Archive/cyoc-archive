<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fukushu scowled as he gazed out the window of the security office. Aboliths assault had not gone unnoticed. Needless to say, those in positions of authority were not happy. &quot;Did you really think sending Abolith after a group of kids was a smart move,&quot; Ayami exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Fukushu turned, furrowing his brow at the angel of maternity. &quot;She was gathering information,&quot; he stated. &quot;And her instincts proved correct. Were you aware of the presence of dark majokko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but that&#39;s not the point,&quot; Ayami countered, her tone fierce. &quot;You sent an assassin to spy on a group of teenage girls! One of whom happens to be friends with the freaking Werewolf Princess!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And from what we heard she&#39;s not the majokko and was sticking up for Winery and the others,&quot; Ayami bellowed. &quot;You do realize King Lycaeon will be here any moment!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I KNOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ayami huffed, the blue skinned angel furious at Fukushu. The kitsunes distrustful nature had created a diplomatic incident between humans, lycans, and kitsunes. Abolith threatening Felicity about the whereabouts of the Dark majokko crossed a line as far as the human Board of Education was concerned. This incensed Fukushu to no end. Humans more concerned about a girl being yelled at than the appearance of dark majokko that may be connected to the One Humanity. Worse was the problems that now existed between the kitsune and lycans.<br />
<br />
Lycans, and King Lycaeon in particular, were already weary of the elf assassin. Only a few short years ago, she had led an army of Voids into the lycan domain. Many lycans perished that day, a fact King Lycaeon made very clear after hearing of today&#39;s incident. The fight between Winery and Abolith had devolved into a he said, she said affair. Winery insisted that Abolith had threatened to kill her friend, while Abolith stated that Winery had ambushed and assaulted her. Needless to say, Fukushu&#39;s sister Kiko and his father Tatsu were now in talks with diplomats of the Lycan kingdom. <br />
<br />
&quot;I take it your siblings weren&#39;t exactly thrilled to hear your beloved assaulted the werewolf princess,&quot; Ayami grumbled. &quot;Aside from my parents, none in the kitsune kingdom were aware I was on speaking terms with them,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;Needless to say it was a surprise. One that caught them off guard, I am not looking forward to those conversations. Nor my parents criticism of Aboliths actions. And Abolith never attacked the princess. That rumor needs to be squashed IMMEDIATELY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ayami frowned, folding her arms across her chest as she glared at Fukushu. This entire situation was proving to be a nightmare. Akira was trusted and respected throughout the supernatural community. The angels husband had proven himself to be a compassionate and competent guardian. If it had been Akira who encountered the dark majokko, he could have rallied them to his side, convinced them of the threat they posed. The same could not be said of Fukushu.<br />
<br />
Fukushu had spent centuries establishing a reputation for himself as a merciless warrior. The stories of his prowess and ferocity in battle had given rise to a mythology that painted the nine tail as a supernatural boogeyman. Couple that with his alliance with an entity that nearly destroyed not one but two timelines meant he had few allies. It didn&#39;t matter if he was attempting to turn over a new leaf, for the entire supernatural world he was either hated or feared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Fukushu,&quot; a voice now blared out over the loud speaker on his desk. &quot;Can you please report to the lobby? King Lycaeon is here to see you.&quot; Fukushu exhaled, his shoulders slumping in exhaustion for a moment. This meeting was going to be difficult. Composing himself, the nine tailed kitsune now strode from his office, his tails swishing behind him majestically.<br />
<br />
Marching towards the lobby, Fukushu now beheld the massive King of the Lycans. Standing at 9 feet tall and weighing close to 1000 lbs, Lycaeon was an impressive specimen. The massive werewolf was covered in well groomed  brown fur, his muscles seeming to strain under his skin from their bulk. With a crown positioned on top of his head, the werewolf now focused his brilliant, yellow eyes on the approaching kitsune. &quot;Fukushu,&quot; he growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;King Lycaeon,&quot; Fukushu replied. Fukushu now found himself tilting his head upwards, the werewolf towering over the kitsune, despite Fukushu being well over 6 feet tall. &quot;We need to talk,&quot; Lycaeon said, his voice a deep and threatening growl. &quot;Why was my daughter attacked by that elf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid you are mistaken King Lycaeon,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;Princess Winery was unharmed in this incident. Abolith, however, was after confronting a human girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you calling my daughter a liar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;Only that you have been misinformed. Winery and her friend were unharmed. Abolith was in pursuit of a dark majokko.&quot; Lycaeon frowned, lowering his head so that his massive head was eye level with Fukushu. &quot;My understanding of the situation is your elven whore threatened a human girl,&quot; Lycaeon continued. &quot;She would have murdered her too if not for my daughters actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith was not going to harm the girl,&quot; Fukushu growled, his hand now resting on the hilt of his katana. &quot;And if you refer to my beloved as a whore again I will split you in two.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lycaeon chuckled menacingly, his fangs beared at the angry kitsune. &quot;It seems I&#39;ve struck a nerve,&quot; he grinned. &quot;However you seem to forget general. I am more inclined to believe my daughter than two traitors who nearly destroyed our world.&quot; Fukushu said nothing, his eyes narrowing as he stared at the massive werewolf. He couldn&#39;t blame Lycaeon for not trusting him, his actions as well as Aboliths, had devastated the Lycan kingdom. <br />
<br />
&quot;The only reason I have not torn both you and your beloved to pieces is because of your father and Akira,&quot; Lycaeon continued. &quot;They say you have changed for the better. That you actually trusted a human wizard. What was the boys name, Darren?&quot; Fukushu nodded, curious as to what else Lycaeon was aware of. &quot;To think that the Angel of Vengeance would actually trust a human boy is something I thought impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you are willing to listen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Lycaeon mused rubbing his chin. &quot;A fight between us would accomplish nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you know I would best you werewolf,&quot; Fukushu grinned. Lycaeon scowled, emitting a low growl at the kitsune. &quot;Dont get cocky fox,&quot; he snarled. The two now stood motionless, glaring at one another for a moment. &quot;I trust both Akira and Tatsu,&quot; Lycaeon continued. &quot;They both say that I should give you the benefit of the doubt in this situation. However, my daughters friend is not to be trifled with. The girl states she was defending Winery&#39;s good name, and I believe her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will personally offer her an apology,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;However, the matter of the Dark majokko.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is concerning,&quot; Lycaeon stated. &quot;My people and my allies will assist in the investigation of this dark majokko. I doubt their appearance is coincidence. They may have aligned themselves with the One Humanity.&quot; Fukushu nodded in agreement. Lycaeon now stood at his full height, glaring down at the kitsune with fierce eyes before he spoke. &quot;Be warned though kitsune. If you or your beloved threaten my daughter or her friends again then you will have to deal with me. I do not fear the Death Fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, the pair going their separate ways. Despite not being a diplomat, the kitsune felt things went rather well. With the help of the kycan community, perhaps Fukushu could find these dark majokko while the diplomats did their job.</p>
