<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle and Riley arrived at practice right on time. They ran to the locker room and through their workout bags in their respective lockers. Riley was surprised that he now had all the pertinent knowledge to function in his new reality; he knew all the other players, he knew his locker number, he knew all the plays and all the rules of the game. It surprised him because the old, non-jock part of his brain knew that he had never played football before in his life, let alone stepped foot into a locker room before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright let&#39;s go dude!&quot;, Kyle said, patting Riley on the back. Riley looked at Kyle, in his professional college football jersey, and thought how he looked in nearly every way like a football player. Riley felt a rush of pride (and embarrassment from his nerdy side) when he realized he probably looked the same way in his uniform and massive, hulking body. They high fived each other and rushed out onto the field. <br />
<br />
Practice was tough that day; coach worked them pretty hard and it was really hot and sunny out. Within minutes, the under garments of both the boys uniforms were absolutely soaked. Riley grimaced, as he could feel his hairy crotch was becoming totally soaked. He looked over and saw that Kyle was getting really sweaty too. That thought made Riley&#39;s huge member, barely contained in his pants soft as it was, start to get plump and harden up. &quot;God, the new me is such a fag&quot;, Riley thought to himself. A pang of sadness came when he remembered that less than a week ago, he was crazy about girls. Now, thinking about girls did nothing for him in the slightest.<br />
<br />
The first drill, after the laps in the beginning, were tackle drills with the tackle dummies. When Riley was up, he took a running start and slammed his massive body into it. The force he created was immense! &quot;Whoa, I am a fucking tank now!&quot;, Riley thought to himself. &quot;I bet people would be afraid of me on the field!&quot;.<br />
<br />
After some running drills and some passing and catching drills, they began to play a loosely organized practice match. Riley found himself excelling, using his heft and strength to take down the other players with ease. Everytime his massive body smashed into another player, he felt a rush of excitement and pride. He saw that Kyle was also doing really well on the field.<br />
<br />
Playing this well made Riley feel pretty turned on. He felt so masculine and manly! He was now one of those big, muscle bound, hairy football players! The part of him that was his old self was frightened and was rapidly losing the fight; giving into his new life was becoming too easy!<br />
<br />
After the practice, Kyle met up with him in the locker room. They had lockers right next to each other. Kyle took off his helmet and set it on the bench. Riley saw that Kyle&#39;s hair was matted down and the brown stubble on his face looked even thicker! Riley took his helmet off too, and a quick swipe of his face told him his stubble was thicker, too. &quot;Good practice, Riley&quot;, Kyle said in his masculine baritone voice. &quot;Yeah, Kyle, it was pretty fun&quot;, Riley said.<br />
<br />
Kyle opened his locker and began to strip out of his sweaty gear. Kyle nonchalantly stripped totally naked, his sweat soaked jockstrap splatting to the ground. Riley&#39;s eyes bulged and he couldn&#39;t help but ogle him. Kyle&#39;s massively broad and powerful chest was covered in a thick rug of hair, even more than this morning it looked like. The hair was totally matted down with sweat. Riley could even see a scattering of thick brown hairs sprouting out of his shoulders and his upper arms, which were likewise huge and muscular. Following the matted rug of hair on his chest, down his stomach, Riley saw Kyle&#39;s massive member. It had definitely grown since the last time he had seen it. It grew out of the massively bushy thatch of pubic hair, hanging soft at about 9 or 10 inches. It was ridiculously thick, and the whole length was criss crossed with thick veins. Riley felt his own massive cock getting hard in his football pants. It was then that Riley noticed that Kyle had some pretty bad B.O. from the workout; it hung around him almost like a tangible cloud of stink. His nerdy self was disgusted by the stink, but his new part was oddly attracted to it now.<br />
<br />
Kyle grinned when he saw Riley staring at his cock; &quot;Haha, Riley, way to be subtle about checking me out. You know we have to wait until were back to our dorms!&quot;. Riley blushed a deep red, but the new part of his mind told him this was fairly normal. Kyle threw on some old boxers and gym shorts, and an old sweat stained wifebeater, not even bothering to shower. Riley gulped as he saw the huge thatch of hair sticking up out of the top of Kyle&#39;s wifebeater. Kyle then stretched, almost taunting Riley. He saw Kyle&#39;s hairy pits on full display, and man were they hairy. Riley&#39;s half hard man meat began leaking precum even more profusely into his sweaty jockstrap.<br />
<br />
With Kyle waiting on him, Riley quickly shucked his gear and stripped nude. He gasped when he saw that he had growna bit more muscular since the morning. His chest had sprouted some more hair, too. When he shucked his jockstrap, his cock and balls flopped out. He grunted, as they felt much heavier and bigger than before. Riley walked over to the mirror, moaning as his cock and balls painfully swung back and forth, banging his hairy thighs. Riley saw that he also had grown a handful of thick hairs on his shoulders and upper back, like Kyle. He was less than thrilled about this, but if he was going to be a furball, might as well go all the way. Riley also noticed the hair on his forearms were thicker or longer, making them look incredibly manly. He also noticed more veins snaking up and down his huge arms. Noticing he smelled a bit bad too, Riley lifted up his thick arms. Riley took an experimental sniff of his now very bushy pit jungle; Whooo! It stunk pretty bad! Riley took one last look at his body. He was shocked that less than a week ago, he was a hairless, tiny, short, and weak person. Now he was this hairy behemoth with a tool that looked like it should be on a horse more than a human being. It was wild!<br />
<br />
Riley walked, or more accurately, waddled back to his locker, due to his cock and balls being totally unsupported. He opened his locker and fished some old basketball shorts and a white wifebeater as well and put them on. Riley saw that huge tufts of his chest hair poked out of the top, and quite a bit of his pit hair was sticking out, even with his arms at full rest.<br />
<br />
Kyle walked over to Riley once he was dressed. &quot;Alright Riles, you ready? Im horny as fuck, and it&#39;s still a bit of a walk to our dorm before we can start fooling around&quot;. &quot;Uggh, yeah, sure dude&quot;, Riley responded. They both walked out of the locker room and towards their dorm. Half way to the dorms, Riley caught Kyle checking him out. &quot;God, Riley, you know how much I like it when you chest hair sticks out of your tanks and shirts like that&quot;, Kyle said. Kyle reached out and playfully tugged on a chunk of Riley&#39;s long, thick hairs. Riley felt his hormones race again, his cock leaking more precum into his pants again. &quot;Uhh, yeah, thanks dude&quot;, Riley said, before uncharacteristically adding a &quot;Yours too, dude. It&#39;s so sexy&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, did Just call another dude&#39;s chest hair &#39;sexy&#39;? What is wrong with me&quot;, Riley said. <br />
<br />
On the walk, Riley&#39;s mind raced; he was so desperately horny, and needed to get off so badly. Plus, he really wanted Kyle, even though his mind was trying to reject his new homosexual attractions. However, this new reality told him that they were boyfriends and they were very much sexually active. But, Riley knew that if he gave in to his desires, there might be no way to reverse the changes and return to his old self. The nerdy part of his brain was terrified of the possibility, and knew that the new self would totally take over if Riley let himself go. The other jockish part of his mind was thinking more with his dick than anything else; he really needed to get off, and Damn, was Kyle so hot to him now.<br />
<br />
Riley was still conflicted in his mind when they arrived at the dorm. Kyle stuck the key in the lock and opened the door. Riley took a deep breath and stepped inside, unsure of what exactly was going to take place. Kyle followed his roommate in and shut the door behind them.</p>
