<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>As soon as I got this idea in my head, I couldn’t help but write it. I’m new to writing basically anything horror related, so if you can please tell me what I can do to improve and make your heart pump, at least a little!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    Even though Issac wasn’t physically there, within that place was a presence. Something malicious. Pushing a heavy weight on both Ilvir’s and Issac’s mind. This strange library of crimson light and shadows was wrong. It didn’t take a paladin to know that this place was unholy. It’s negative energy seemed to pour into every inch space within it. <br />
<br />
    Issac could feel Ilvir’s trepidation but he remained steadfast even when the quietest step he took on the wooden flooring still caused a long creak that lasted for a second too long, each shadow always too long. <br />
<br />
     Ilvir did his best to push through it, always moving with decision and never showing sign of fear, but Issac could tell that his defenses would eventually be ground down. Although Issac couldn’t communicate with Ilvir, he still silently whispered a paladin prayer of good fortune in his mind as Ilvir walked through those halls.<br />
<br />
      The library seemed endless with its tomes and scrolls, and although neither of then could read their contents they could guess at what they were. Books detailing the dark arts, corruption magic, necromancy, and even more defiled knowledge. Once the source of the corruption had been dealt with, Issac would return here and purge this place of its corruption. However, first Ilvir needed to find a way out of there. <br />
<br />
    Within Ilvir’s mind, Issac couldn’t use any of his magic, so besides Ilvir’s own physical senses he couldn’t tell where his spawn was going, but he trusted Ilvir to know what to do.<br />
<br />
    Thus Ilvir sneaked, exploring that dark place alone for an hour. Ilvir didn’t find anything of immediate interest, but Issac did notice one thing and from Ilvir’s body language and emotions, he realized it too. It was getting darker. The library was already draped in a dim red light that came from ornate stained glass windows high above him, but he could tell that the shadows were growing longer, and the light weaker.  <br />
<br />
  Perhaps whatever this place is has it’s own day night cycle? But wouldn’t that mean that it was potentially a pocket plane? A small world hidden in the space between realities? It wouldn’t change much either way.<br />
<br />
       Upon reaching the two hour mark, Ilvir finally found himself at a place of note. Nestled between two book shelves, almost hidden was a stairway going down. It was the only thing either of them had seen like it within this place.<br />
<br />
      Ilvir’s apprehension grew upon seeing it, but he took a moment to breath, calming himself as much as he could. Issac could feel Ilvir’s temptation to return back to Issac’s physical body, after all, he had explored a good portion of this and besides the stressful atmosphere and lack of light, there didn’t seem to be any immediate dangers. Issac was prone to agree with him. He had explored enough, and although Issac couldn’t speak to Ilvir, he almost begged him in his mind to come back. This was not a place to be inside of alone. <br />
<br />
  Yet for some reason that eluded Issac, Ilvir began walking down, firmly grasping the railing as he stepped on ancient wooden stairs. He descended down, into the darkness, where even the light, whatever minuscule red fragments were remaining, had left him.<br />
<br />
    They were both completely blind in the darkness. Only touch and sound to guide them.<br />
<br />
         Suddenly, Ilvir, perhaps because of his lack of visual aid, mistimed his step down the stair and found himself tripping down the stairway, his heavy granite body causing a loud crashing noise that scraped both Ilvir’s and Issac’s body.<br />
<br />
  Eventually after what felt like an eternity of rushing wind, and granite and wooden crashing against each other, Ilvir was at the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
      His painful victory was short lived however, once the howling came. It was an unearthly cry. Issac couldn’t tell if it came from a single wailing child or a roaring chorus of monstrosities, but he could tell one thing about it. There was blood lust in it’s cry. <br />
<br />
    Somewhere within the darkness to the right of Ilvir, a heavy shape was moving towards Ilvir in the complete darkness. How far away was it? How big was the room Ilvir was in? Issac couldn’t tell and he knew Ilvir didn’t want to find out as he quickly got up, and half ran and half crawled back up the stairs. The beast was moving faster than he was, and half way up the stairs he could hear the creature’s claws scrape the wood beneath it as it began lunging up after him.<br />
<br />
   They could see it up ahead. The barely visible light up ahead. They didn’t know if it would stop whatever was chasing Ilvir, but it was better than to be stumbling in the dark. <br />
<br />
 *RUN ILVIR! RUN!* Issac shouted in his mind, knowing his voice couldn’t reach Ilvir, whose mind was wracked with desperation and fear. He had been there alone for too long. He was starting to crack. <br />
<br />
  Finally Ilvir had made it up the stairway and into the crimson light, and reciting a quick incantation conjured a orb of radiant light into his palm, spinning around and stretching his arm to blast whatever was chasing him.<br />
<br />
  The second the orb was conjured, it almost instantly extinguished, the shadows around it almost piercing into it, devouring it the second it sprung into existence.<br />
<br />
    *Dam it Ilvir, use something other than light magic!* Issac screamed in his mind.<br />
<br />
   The shape was not far behind Ilvir, and in the seconds that seemed to stretch for a eternity, the image of the creature bounding up the stairs caused Issac to recoil within himself as he saw the terrible image of the beast.<br />
<br />
    It was an abomination. It took no discernible shape, only a vile mass of inky black tendrils and boiling shadows. Maws within maws, limbs stuck to limbs. Heads constantly forming and then bursting from within only to unveil another grisly head. Yet somehow it moved faster than any predator could. Bounding up and crashing down towards Ilvir within seconds. <br />
<br />
     *ILVIR FIGHT BACK. PLEASE FIGHT BACK!*<br />
<br />
 It was hopeless. The terrible beast descended upon Ilvir and immediately, both Issac and Ilvir’s minds were wracked with pain, as the inky form of the creature and the pain it inflicted took the focus of all of their thoughts.<br />
<br />
 Ilvir screamed a cry for help Issac had never heard him utter before.<br />
<br />
        Suddenly, within Ilvir’s mind, Issac became aware of something. There was another presence. Another entity sharing the space within Ilvir’s head. Before Issac could react, he was pushed out, the connection between Master and Spawn cut as Issac was sent reeling back into his own body. His molten heart thumping fiercely between his chest, eyes leaking a purple fluid and his mind almost broken from the trauma he just went through.<br />
<br />
   What. What had just happened. What the hell had just happened. Issac could barely think, he could only relive those last few moments of when he was inside Ilvir’s mind. That evil presence, the same one that had been pushing down on their minds the entire time they were there, the one manipulating them, filling them with dread and fear, easily breaking through the cracks of what should’ve been the impenetrable minds of two divine paladins.  How long had it been inside Ilvir’s mind with him? Was it there the moment Ilvir had walked in? Was it still within Issac’s mind right now? He didn’t want to think about that. The pain. The horror. The... pleasure...?<br />
<br />
    Issac felt a brief respite from his near insanity as he realized the state of his arousal. Both his cocks had pushed past his metal loincloth, both of them leaking and throbbing fiercely. His beach ball sized balls seemed to be aching at the overflow of cum they had within.  <br />
<br />
 “Argh!” Issac groaned, unable to help but fondle himself, barely having enough restraint to start masturbating then and there.<br />
<br />
  Why the fuck was he aroused? There was no way he was getting off on what had just happened. The fear, the torment he felt was all very real, he could still feel his mind racing, his heart thumping, his will broken, yet as seconds past, he couldn’t help but get harder and harder at the experience. What was wrong with him? This wasn’t right. No one could suddenly go through such a drastic change. Was it the entity? Had it caused this change? Or was this some sort of fucked up coping mechanism his mind had created to not fall into insanity? <br />
<br />
     Issac was lost in a muddled wreckage of fear and confusion. He wasn’t sure what to do or even if he wanted to do anything. He was tired now and wanted to rest. <br />
<br />
 *But... Ilvir is in danger...* Issac thought numbly.<br />
<br />
 *He’s already dead.* A dark part of his mind spoke up. <br />
<br />
    Issac wanted to fight that voice, but he was far too tired... unable to resist, he let sleep take him... at least for now.<br />
<br />
  As his massive granite form fell asleep, his cocks still leaking fiercely, Issac had no way to notice what was happening. Slowly, the usually bright vivid ruby that rested embedded into his Choker of Purity, shifted in color. Going from a vibrant <br />
red, to a dark inky black...</p>
