<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Devin walked along the stone path, trying not to <br />
trip while he was staring at the amazing campus <br />
for Stonewood University. He pulled his eyes <br />
away from the seniors playing frisbee with a ball of <br />
fire to look at his map. <br />
<br />
He was in the Corneal McCrown Hall in suite 150, <br />
room 153. Devin had looked at the dorm online to <br />
see what he could expect. Unfortunately, there <br />
weren't any pictures; but it had said that each <br />
student got their own room attached to a living <br />
room, a walk-in closet, and a bathroom with a <br />
shower, two sinks, and a seperate toilet. There <br />
were four rooms to a suite, so he would have <br />
three other roommates.<br />
<br />
It was a good thing he had chosen that particular <br />
time to look at his map, because he had just <br />
passed Corneal McCrown Hall. Turning around, <br />
he started to head back to the hall. He ran his <br />
hand through his short, dirty blonde hair and <br />
noticed a group of juniors snickering at him, but <br />
decided it was best to ignore them. He made it <br />
back to the hall and went inside. <br />
<br />
Standing just inside the door in a little lobby area, <br />
was another freshman. He was struggling with his <br />
multiple bags, and Devin decided to see if he <br />
needed assistance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Need some help there?&quot; he asked and went <br />
closer. <br />
<br />
The other boy was kind of scrawny. He was thin <br />
and lanky, but average height. His hair was longer <br />
and light brown. He wasn't dorky, but he certainly <br />
wasn't a jock either. <br />
<br />
Devin, on the other hand, had played football <br />
since elementary school, and had been the <br />
captain and quarterback of his varsity team. He <br />
looked like any other jock, but he didn't act like <br />
them. He cared about others and loved to help. <br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great,&quot; the other boy replied while <br />
setting his bags down to shake Devin's hand, &quot;I'm <br />
Tim. Didn't think to find my room before I brought <br />
my stuff. Obviously you were smarter than me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Devin, and not quite,&quot; he replied and pulled his <br />
drawstring bag off of his back. &quot;I brought all my <br />
stuff too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tim asked, &quot;That's all you brought?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my dad went to Stonewood, and he showed <br />
me a spell that let's a container hold 1000 times its <br />
space. So I fit all that,&quot; he pointed at the many <br />
bags, &quot;Into this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, wish one of my parents had gone here,&quot; he <br />
complained, &quot;I'm the first in my family to have <br />
magic, so I'm pretty much lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Devin told him, &quot;My dad insisted on <br />
living a normal life, so I'm as new to this as you. <br />
He only did this because he didn't want to have to <br />
shove everything in our tiny car. So what suite are <br />
you in?&quot; he asked, picking up some bags. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...150,&quot; Tim answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, I guess we're roomies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Well then let's see what it's like,&quot; he said <br />
and grabbed the remaining bags. <br />
<br />
The suite was at the end of the hall. The door was <br />
already open, so the two went in. The doors were <br />
numbered 151, 152, 153, and 154. The living room <br />
had a couch, two chairs, two lamps and end <br />
tables, a TV stand, and a small but tall table with <br />
four chairs around it.<br />
<br />
Devin took the bags to the first room where Tim <br />
was at, then went to 153. It was a fair-sized room <br />
right across from the bathroom with an inset <br />
dresser and coat rack, a single bed, and a <br />
computer stand next to a large window that looked <br />
out on the yard where the seniors were still <br />
playing with the fire ball. He set his bag on the <br />
bed, and went to see if Tim needed any more <br />
help. <br />
<br />
As he walked out the door, he heard the door from <br />
the far end of the hall, next to the closet, open and <br />
close. He turned to see another freshman with jet-<br />
black hair walk towards him. The boy was tall and <br />
slim with a certain air about him, like he was very <br />
smart and well-aware of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; he greeted, &quot;I suppose you are <br />
my roommate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, my name's Devin,&quot; he said, extending his <br />
hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am called Sigma,&quot; he replied and shook hands, <br />
&quot;Well met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Devin let him pass and go into the bathroom. He <br />
wasn't sure what to think of Sigma, but he was <br />
definitely different. <br />
<br />
Walking back to Tim's room, he heard him <br />
struggling with something else. He knocked, was <br />
allowed to come in, and found Tim fighting with a <br />
lock on his luggage. Then, the key broke. Half <br />
came out, the other half stayed in. There was no <br />
way to get the key out without a pair of pliers or <br />
something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just great!&quot; Tim yelled. &quot;You know Devin, I <br />
wouldn't blame you if you wanted to change <br />
dorms. I have such bad luck, we'll probably all be <br />
dead before the year's out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, it can't be that bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I need to vent somehow,&quot; he said with a <br />
slight grin. &quot;How am I going to get this lock out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me,&quot; came a voice from the open door. <br />
<br />
It was Sigma. He walked over and kneeled by the <br />
luggage. He put his hand to the lock...and claws <br />
came out of his thumb and index finger. He used <br />
the claws as pliers to pull the broken key from the <br />
hole, then used one to open the lock. <br />
<br />
&quot;There you are,&quot; he said, retracting his claws, <br />
&quot;That should be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do that?&quot; Tim asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am a dragon of the Sendrii Clan. We are skilled <br />
shapeshifters. All I did was turn my fingernails <br />
back into their original form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a dragon?&quot; Devin asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said as if it were obvious, &quot;I thought it <br />
was more apparent. Clearly most humans do not <br />
know the identifying features of a dragon. You see, <br />
dragons only have hair on the top of their head, no <br />
matter what form they are in. You didn't notice that <br />
I lacked eyebrows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until you mentioned it,&quot; Devin replied, &quot;But <br />
your hair does cover that area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I should shorten my hair, then,&quot; he said <br />
and it became immediately cropped to a smaller <br />
length.<br />
<br />
Now that it could be seen, his lack of eyebrows <br />
was more apparent. But it still wasn't too <br />
noticeable. <br />
<br />
Before Devin could reply, the suite's door opened <br />
again. All three turned to see their final roommate. <br />
He was lithe and muscular, with a clear runner's <br />
build. He wore athletic shorts and a muscle shirt <br />
that clung to his defined pecs and abs. He had <br />
very short dark brown hair and a ruggedly <br />
handsome face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he said when he saw the group, &quot;I didn't <br />
know we were having a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not,&quot; Sigma said and walked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's his problem?&quot; the new guy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, Sigma's just...himself,&quot; Devin tried to <br />
explain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, not the social type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that. I'm Devin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim,&quot; he added, standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir,&quot; the new boy introduced himself. &quot;But just <br />
call me Fang. So I guess you guys are my <br />
roommates?&quot;<br />
<br />
Affirming this, the two boys stepped into the living <br />
room so they could meet their last roommate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then, I guess we should get to know each <br />
other. Hey Siggy! Quit sulking and join the party!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not be addressed like that!&quot; he said, coming <br />
out of his room nonetheless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dragon?&quot; Fang asked to which Sigma nodded, <br />
&quot;Figures. Alright, let's play 'Know Your <br />
Roommates'! The game where you find out who <br />
the hell you're spending the next year with! Our <br />
first contestant: Devin! Why don't you tell the <br />
viewers at home a little about yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Devin could help chuckling at the ecstatic way <br />
Fang acted. At least, he thought, I won't be bored <br />
this year. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; he said, playing along, &quot;I'm Devin <br />
Walker. I'm here for a degree in transformation. <br />
My interests are magic and football, and I hate <br />
rainy days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Tim Stevenson. I'm majoring in conjuration. I <br />
like reading and art, and I dislike arrogant people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Fenrir Tracker, but everyone calls me Fang. <br />
I'm majoring in lycanthropy, I love track and cross <br />
country, and I hate kill-joys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a werewolf?!&quot; Tim seemed scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down,&quot; Fang assured him, &quot;I have control <br />
over it. I'm a a werewolf by lineage, not by <br />
infection. I'm what you might call a real werewolf. I <br />
can change whenever I want and have full control <br />
over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Siggy, your turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cease calling me that name!&quot; Sigma yelled, &quot;I'm <br />
the son of Caltho, leader of the Sendrii Clan, and I <br />
will not be ridiculed by some...mutt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, fly boy just introduce yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on you two,&quot; Devin tried to diffuse the <br />
tension, &quot;Let's be friends now, I don't want to hear <br />
you two arguing all year. Sigma, will you introduce <br />
yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, calming down. &quot;I am Sigma of <br />
the Sendrii Clan. I am studying draconology and <br />
interspecific relations. I enjoy scholarly <br />
conversation and I despise rabble-rousers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great, Devin thought, I'm going to have to listen to <br />
these two argue all year. <br />
<br />
After a few hours of unpacking and determining <br />
spaces, the four roommates were ready to explore <br />
the campus.</p>
