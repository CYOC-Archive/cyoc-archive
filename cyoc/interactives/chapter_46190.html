<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, wake up already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy stirred, hearing a younger, female voice.  &quot;Wah..uh...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, you're real slow on the uptake aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy opened her eyes.  She was in a dimly-lit room, laying in a bed.  The covers were warm.  Looking around, she didn't see anyone.<br />
<br />
The internal voice made what sounded like a sigh.  &quot;Looking in the wrong place, girl.  I'm inside you...us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy sat up, displacing the blanket.  She was naked underneath.  Her body looked different.  Her arms were more slender, her hands a little more delicate.  Her breasts were noticeably smaller as well, and her tummy was flat as a board.  Longer bangs than she was used to fell in front of her eyes, and she could tell her hair was darker in color.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what's....&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't freak out, please!  Just breathe!  Good air in, bad air out.  Come on, breathe with me...that's it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy managed to calm herself.  &quot;You...you're Mallory, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, the sighing.  &quot;Yep.  They didn't bother to tell me anything about you tho'.  Just what their big plan was.  Take a perfectly healthy person, and a burned-out junkie, put 'em in a blender, and see what comes out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy could feel the self-loathing in Mallory's voice.  This girl...she hated herself, and thought everyone hated her.  Despite her own horror at what had been done to them, she hugged herself tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't talk like that.  This isn't your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...so what.  You had a life, now I'm some kind of parasite shoved inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy shook her head.  &quot;You're not a parasite.  You're a part of me, now.  Hating you would be like hating my own arm...and just as dumb.  If we're going to survive, we're going to need each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....I guess.  But what can I do?  I'm just a voice in your head, you're in charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy frowned.  &quot;I don't believe that.  I think you're just afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I saw those scars you had.  Too afraid to live.  Just a scared little girl.  Pathetic, hopeless.  You're right, you're nothing but useless baggage.  Because of you, I'm smaller and weaker, thanks a lot for nothing, you little whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy's head (well, technically, their head) moved violently to the side in response to the slap across their cheek.  It stung, but it had the desired effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck, ow, that hurt, you bitch....wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the pain, Amy couldn't help but giggle. <br />
<br />
&quot;You...you...BITCH!  You sounded so nice, I walked right into that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled.  &quot;I love you too, Mal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...my sister used to call me that, before she ran away.&quot;  Mallory's voice (or whatever it was) seemed to soften, and Amy was reminded that rough life or not, Mallory wasn't even 18 yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well unless it bothers you, I'm going to call you that too.  I mean, we're way closer than sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah...yeah.  I'd like that, Amy...if you called me Mal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done.  So see, you can be in charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if it had a life of it's own, Amy's left arm raised and touched their cheek.  &quot;I don't know how I did it tho', I just...did.  I can't seem to control anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it time, Mal.  I bet you were left handed, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...ooh, and you're not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.  So see, right there, that's an advantage we got.  My roommate used to tease I couldn't even masturbate with my left hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mallory's internal monologue disolved into mental giggling.  &quot;Oh Jeez, that is bad.  Well that's one thing you'll never have to worry about, I'm very good with my hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if to demonstrate, their left hand slid beneath the covers, and began to rub their crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;A...ah!&quot;  Amy was too suprised to react at first.  &quot;Th..that feels nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm, and that's just the beginning.&quot;  Two fingers pressed themselves into their shared slit, and began probing inside.  Electricity seemed to arc up her spine as Amy made a soft moan of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...no.  Don't do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, it's going to be ok.  You need this.  We both need this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B..but...Mal...we're both girls!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?  It's my body too, what, are you saying I can't touch myself?&quot;  Mallory ended that thought with a wicked little laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just...last time...&quot;  Amy flushed, the shame coming back to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever happened, this isn't going to be like that.  God, you're pretty screwed up too.  Glad I'm not the only one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mallory picked up speed, thrusting fingers into their pussy.  Amy groaned with sudden need.  She lay back and relaxed her legs, no longer wanting to fight the other girl.<br />
<br />
Before long, she felt ready to burst, but release wouldn't come.  She could feel Mallory's frustration as well as her own.  Amy grabbed her breast, which was much smaller than the C cup she was used to, and squeezed it roughly, pinching the nipple between two fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yeah...thas it, make it hurt Amy....&quot;<br />
<br />
Her nails dug into the soft flesh of their breast, even as Mallory violently assaulted their shared womanhood.  Release came suddendly, causing their body to shudder, and temporarily paralyzing Amy.  A wordless sound of triumph escaped her lips as their back arched.  Euphoria overwhelmed her, and she relaxed totally, gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;....wow.  Double orgasm.&quot;  Even Mal seemed subdued.<br />
<br />
&quot;uh huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok?  I know I pushed you but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled.  &quot;Payback for what I did before.  And it was...wonderful.  Nothing like before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was at a party, and got really drunk.  When I went to the bathroom, some other girls went in and they...I couldn't stop them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, gang raped by girls.  Guess that kind of turned you off of the whole lesbian thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It turned me off the whole sex thing, to be honest.  Um...are you a lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's probably not being fair to the male population, but most of the guys I've had sex with were...twisted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The woman said they tried to keep you young...so they were pedophiles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really like that term, Amy.  Not everyone who's physically attracted to kids is the same.  People don't always understand their own feelings, you know?  While I admit, most of the guys...and some of the girls...I was with were scum, there were a few that were different.  They wanted me, but they didn't really understand why.  Sometimes we just ended up talking, or laying together, nothing sexual happening at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mallory paused.  &quot;Sorry for the rant, but I don't like it when people just file someone into a category.  Some very nice people find themselves lusting after younger girls, and they suffer for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Mal, I guess I sound like a bigot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, nothing like that.  You just never gave it much thought.  And who could blame you?  We're all taught that's bad, just like being gay is bad somehow.  But I mean, think about it.  Our ancestors thought nothing of sniffing after a girl once she started to bleed; we didn't live long enough.  If you were old enough to have kids...well you get the idea.  But we also got this hard-wired need to protect or nurture kids.  We see someone smaller, younger, and we want to help them.  Well, good people at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what you're saying is, once we stopped forcing kids to grow up so fast, some people get stuck in this weird middle ground, where their bodies say 'oh yeah, i'd so hit that'...and our brains say 'no, they're too young, we need to help them!'.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal was silent for several moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...Mal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it's just...I don't know if it's just that no one ever cared to listen before, or what, but I'm not used to people understanding what I'm talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well one, I kind of have to listen.  I don't know how I'd tune you out if I wanted to...which is not saying I do!  And two, well, as far as we know, we share the same brain, the same body...it's only natural that I can grok you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy laughed.  &quot;It's a term from a science fiction novel that us geeks latched onto.  It's an alien term for totally understanding something, to the point where the concept becomes a part of you, and you can add to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like those aliens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy reached up and ran her fingers gently through their hair.  &quot;And I liked what you did for us.  Thank you, Mal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mallory's hand clasped Amy's.  &quot;Anytime.&quot;<br />
<br />
They found out after some inspection that they'd made quite a mess of the sheets, which were quite damp.  There was a little blood (Mallory had been quite rough) as well, and their pussy felt raw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that's a lot of girl-juice.  You must be a gusher.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy blushed.  &quot;Me?!  You're the tramp, not me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but even though I've seen it, I've never ejaculated like that before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, it's not a bad thing, it's not like you pissed all over the place.  What do they teach you in sex ed, anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smirked.  &quot;That female ejaculation is a myth, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah.  So how are we getting out of here, anyways?&quot;</p>
