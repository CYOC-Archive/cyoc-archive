<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caleb knew what he was signing on for when he went ahead with the cajoling of his sister Cynthia and the nonchalance of his mother Alice. His sister was always kind of a weirdo - teasing him in rather inappropriate ways then playing dumb when he complained about it to his mom. Caleb was a rather thin, nerdy looking guy, more athletic than you might assume from a look mostly owing to a fitness routine he maintained when he wasn&#39;t browsing the internet. He had black hair, light blue eyes, and a somewhat pale countenance.<br />
<br />
And right now, Caleb knew he was heading out for something his sister had brought his mom into a few times before. The reputed &quot;Sensua Pool Facility&quot;. Reportedly, it only allowed women in the pool - to downright unusual and somewhat invasive extents. Reportedly, the pool required men visiting to be transformed into women first before they could join the festivities in the pool.<br />
<br />
Now, Caleb was not about to just give up his piece between his legs for two or three hours, however long these two stayed here. He was more attached to his identity than that. But he was also getting tired of his sister&#39;s insistence. And his mom wouldn&#39;t believe it unless she saw it for herself. Such resulted in Caleb coming up with a plan all his own.<br />
<br />
As of now, they were heading over to the pool. Caleb dressed in a tank top and shorts and carrying a small backpack full of goods for his plans, whereas the other two were already dressed in swimsuits. It just made it all the clearer to him - he was gonna need to undergo some changes at least. He gulped, hoping at least that it wouldn&#39;t hurt too much. Though he would be engaging in a bit of mischief.<br />
<br />
His sister had, in true Cynthia fashion, gloated about how it worked.<br />
<br />
There was a body spray that had to be applied across the body for the transformation - each place being transformed in turn. Caleb had his own plan, but he hoped it worked. He&#39;d hate to have his effort rendered moot. As they drove up to the Sensua Pools facility and parked, Caleb took in the appearance of the place. It was remarkably large, and had a front desk and relaxation area, along with a workout area to the side. He didn&#39;t know if anyone was gonna be required to change to use that.<br />
<br />
As they got out and approached it, getting a closer look, Caleb raised an eyebrow. He could almost recognize a few people.<br />
<br />
Entering the place, he kept his head down, only listening in when he heard his mom paying for the full experience for her, her daughter, and her son. He was more or less tossed a bottle of body spray once the payment was done, and Caleb then looked up and looked around. It seemed the pool was remarkably loosely staffed, nobody really minding what went on. Some of the people in the jacuzzi off to the side were getting pretty frisky - and nobody cared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come out when you get fully changed,&quot; Alice said, shrugging her shoulders and walking into the womens&#39; locker room to freshen up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll make a cute girl,&quot; Cynthia said with a grin, &quot;Trust me. Heh, not like you make a very compelling boy!&quot; And with that she followed her mom into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Caleb gulped, and started to head toward the &quot;men&#39;s&quot; locker room. His plan was due to begin soon. As he walked he saw some people heading out, and he swore as he walked by he recognized the woman leading the group. She stopped, looked at Caleb and chuckled, &quot;Wow, isn&#39;t it just the most amazing thing! Little Caleb&#39;s getting in touch with his feminine side!&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman had long cut blond hair, a surprisingly built, athletic build, and the tone and accent all matched up with someone Caleb knew well from his senior year of high school. He bit his lip lightly, &quot;Kyle Caldwell!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Kyley right now.&quot; Kyle responded, flaunting his---her---whatever bust, &quot;I decided I had to try this place out. This is my second time here. Check this out! My muscles stay when I&#39;m a chick! Wild huh? Why don&#39;t we get more acquainted when we meet up out there, eh?&quot; And with that Kyle kept moving alongside her friends.<br />
<br />
How was it that Kyle Caldwell was still as much of a macho jerk and a bully when he was transformed like this? Well, maybe it was true that ultimately the change didn&#39;t really hit the mind all that much. Alleviating at least one of Caleb&#39;s worries. He proceeded into the locker room, and toward one of the &quot;changing stalls&quot;. He knew now was the time. The stalls had no mechanisms, and no weird sensors or anything. They were ultimately just repurposed bathroom stalls. There were even non-marked bathroom stalls off to the side from the so marked &quot;changing stalls&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which meant the plan was go.<br />
<br />
Caleb started using the spray on himself, wincing as he felt the transformative effects start. His limbs kept their strength and lean quality, but otherwise metamorphosed into a new feminine shape as he sprayed. He felt his chest get tight when he sprayed there, and he detected himself getting a little taller but also somehow a little older. It seemed there was a wild card element here. He felt his hair getting longer, and his hips getting wider.<br />
<br />
Caleb kept spraying...but conspicuously avoided spraying his crotch. As the transformation went on and the rest of his body feminized, becoming more and more girl and less and less boy, his manhood remained as it was. A mid size piece between his legs, nicely thick but only about 6 inches long. It still pleased his occasional lover he found in the nerdy conventions he went to.<br />
<br />
Before long, Caleb stood there an athletic, capable young woman - but retaining the piece between his legs that identified him as male. He fit on a strap - usually for athletic events and such, but bought with this sort of thing in mind. It&#39;d keep his manhood from getting too noticeable. Even if it swelled into full erection, as Caleb expected it to what with his C verging on D cup breasts feeling sooo fucking sensitive.<br />
<br />
He then put on his new womens&#39; swimsuit over his athletic strap and exited the changing stall. Nobody else any the wiser that one crucial piece of Caleb remained unchanged. He honestly looked pretty good in the swimsuit, though he was still looking forward to this being over. Admittedly, his plan for this was simple. See how this place was, keeping his unit as it was, and see if he could find a hook up or anything of the sort. Admittedly a pretty sex-centric plan, and one he hoped didn&#39;t get him busted or banned.<br />
<br />
But one he honestly saw as getting back at his sister&#39;s unending harassment. Caleb proceeded outside through the locker room&#39;s rear door, into the pool area. It seemed to be divided between a few different large pools. His sister and mom were off playing around in the second pool, and...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Caleb---er, Christy I guess.&quot; Kyle / Kyley walked over, swaggering. She seemed to be just as haughty as ever. &quot;Looks like you got a pretty hot transformation. Niiice!&quot; Caleb rolled his eyes - Kyle was of course being himself even now. But Caleb looked down at himself for a moment, remembering his trick. Nobody called him on it. There was exactly one life guard in charge around here - and that person was perpetually watching the second pool - which seemed to focus more on competitive swimming.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Caleb thought despite himself that Kyle made a pretty cute girl. The muscles even contributed! Caleb felt himself stirring a bit. Yep, still worked. What to do now?</p>
