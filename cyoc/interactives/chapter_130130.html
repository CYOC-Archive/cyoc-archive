<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days later and the trio had settled into a routine of sorts. Doug loved his new pipes and kept them going all day. Tyler had learnt how to clean and maintain them so there was always a fresh bowl ready. He still had a long way to go to catch up with his hirsute masters, but Tyler was definitely getting hairier and had no desire to shave, even if the program had allowed it. The others complimented his thick and rapid beard growth and the pelt developing all over his body, joking about the scrawny goatee he had only a few days ago - they suggested that he might be gaining weight, but Tyler dismissed it as a trick of the light… but he had to admit he did feel more brutish. He’d noticed a fair bit of hair clogging the shower, but not enough to panic, although he could swear that his hairline used to be further forward. Tyler enjoyed Scott and Doug’s company and they indulged in smoke play often and intensely. Tyler’s stash of cigars was going down pretty rapidly - he was smoking several each day, savouring the smoke but not yet inhaling, and he had pipe training from Doug. He loved to smoke both and tried some of Scott’s plentiful supply of dip too, sometimes keeping it in while smoking, although he didn’t gut the spit yet.<br />
<br />
Scott chained his huge cigars and delighted in the huge amounts of smoke that each stick produced. He inhaled deeply all the time and noticed that less smoke was exhaled than he might expect, but didn’t think much of it. But he started having strange, twitchy feelings and was often short-tempered. He would often get the shakes as he was finishing a cigar and getting the next one prepared, and they were often violent enough for him to struggle to get his new cigar lit. But when he did get one going the shakes disappeared. The others noticed too and often kept their distance when his mood was thunderous. <br />
<br />
Tyler was worried about Scott’s moods and behaviour and pressured Doug to confront him.<br />
<br />
“Scott, are you feeling OK?” Doug asked sheepishly. “You seem to be getting agitated a lot these days and we’re a bit concerned.”<br />
<br />
“What? Hell, I’m fine, never better” snapped Scott around his cigar.<br />
<br />
“Well I’ve noticed that you’re getting the shakes when you’re lighting up and your moods are getting really unpredictable.”<br />
<br />
“OK, well I’m sorry if you pussies think that” was his defensive reaction… then he paused to reflect. “Actually, sorry - maybe you’re right, I love my cigars but I’m just not getting the same hit from them the last couple of days, it sounds crazy but it’s like I need even more. And these shakes are freaking me out. I’m already chaining cigars and dipping all day, so I’m not really sure where this is going or how to deal with it”.<br />
<br />
“Well Tyler is a natural with cigars now, he can prepare and light them for you.”<br />
“Yeah that sounds good. I think I’m gonna try out that gas mask now to see how it works. It looks hot.”<br />
<br />
Tyler fetched the mask, prepared, lit and attached a fresh cigar to the end of the nozzle. Scott fitted the mask with relative speed (Steve had chosen a very practical model) and the visor soon filled up with smoke as his face disappeared from view. Scott was in heaven as he drew in copious amounts of delicious smoke. He gave them the thumbs up. Very little smoke escaped the mask. Doug and Tyler looked on in wonder, both getting hard. <br />
<br />
When the cigar was spent Scott emerged beaming, as Tyler handed him a freshly lit cigar. “That was awesome. You guys should try it!” he cried. “Er, thanks but maybe later” joked Tyler, relieved that Scott’s mood had already changed for the better. <br />
<br />
Scott starting using the mask a couple of times a day and his mood-swings abated, although he never got quite the same rush as he did from that first time. Then his attention turned to the smoke sleep equipment. Scott decided he should try it that night, but as his lit cigar never left his mouth there was no practical way for him to fill the smoke box himself. Tyler volunteered to fill the smoke box by exhaling his cigar smoke into it throughout the day, and even Doug joined in with a cigar or two in the evening to bolster the fog for that first time. When it was time for some sleep the gear was set up. The box was thick with the smoke from all of day’s cigar smoking and Scott was dizzy with excitement – immediately after his last cigar of the night he loaded up with his fresh night-time dip and attached the mask - the airway to the box was opened and Scott started breathing in the delicious smoke. He gave another thumbs up and within minutes was fast asleep, drugged by the fragrant air. Doug and Tyler looked on with delight as the smoke circulated. Scott didn’t wake for his usual night smokes and slept much longer than usual. <br />
<br />
In the morning Scott&#39;s mood was ecstatic, and he was cracking jokes for the first time in days as he hauled down his first cigar of the day. “That was incredible guys, I had some awesome smoky dreams about both of you too“  he smiled. “I think I’ll be using this every night from now on. But I want the smoke even thicker so Tyler you’d better work on topping that fog up each day! I don’t know what else is coming in the new program but I’m loving this”. Doug and Tyler were loving it too, their smoke play and sex was getting more adventurous and all three were excited to see what else might be in store.</p>
