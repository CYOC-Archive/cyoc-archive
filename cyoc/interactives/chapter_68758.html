<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark arrived back at his house with his transformed friend, Tim. All the way back home, Mark had been examining the remote he had just stolen, trying to figure out how to make it work. By the time they reached his door he felt confident enough to say, “I think I might be able to help you out a bit.”<br />
<br />
“‘A bit’?” she asked, sounding a bit confused. “What does ‘a bit’ mean?”<br />
<br />
Mark unlocked the door and called out to his parents when he walked inside. No one responded. “Looks like we’re still alone.”<br />
<br />
“Mark, you didn’t answer me,” said Tim as she joined him inside the house. “What did you figure out?”<br />
<br />
Mark replied, “Well, I found a menu that lets me alter someone’s masculinity and femininity. I suppose that could turn you back into a guy at least if I set it to increase your masculinity.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” said Tim, feeling a bit disappointed. “I suppose that’s better than nothing.” She wanted to be her normal self again, not just more masculine. She squirmed a bit as she realized that she felt horny again. “It’d be nice to not have these… urges anymore, at least.”<br />
<br />
“Give me a second to prepare the settings,” said Mark. As he pressed buttons on the device, he paced around the front hall of his house. Tim just watched him work, expectantly. Eventually, Mark stopped in front of a mirror that hung on the wall opposite the door. “I think I have it now,” he said. “I wonder if this is the start button.” His thumb slid over the activation button and accidentally pressed it lightly. “Oops!” he said when he realized what he’d done. The remote had been aimed straight at the mirror, which reflected the beam right back at Mark.<br />
<br />
“What?” said Tim, worried. “What ‘Oops’?”<br />
<br />
Mark shivered a bit as he felt a tingle pass through him. “I think I just accidentally shot myself with the remote,” he admitted, sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Tim gasped. “Look at you,” she said. “You’re growing.”<br />
<br />
Tim was right; Mark watched his reflection in the mirror as his body grew larger. His clothes became tighter as his muscles thickened and his body sprouted upwards. The sensation of his growing power and strength was intoxicating. He felt like a superhero as he flexed his swelling biceps. “Whoa,” he moaned in a noticeably deeper voice. “I’m so freaking huge.” He grunted. “Oh, this feels so damn awesome.”<br />
<br />
They watched as the growing continued. Mark’s thick thighs tore apart his shorts, leaving him wearing nothing but a skin-tight T-shirt and an undersized pair of tighty whities which covered an enormous bulge. Mark grabbed his underwear with his growing hands and ripped the constricting fabric off of him in one quick tug, revealing a massive, growing cock and balls hanging out of a forest of thick pubes. Next he tore off his shirt, Hulk Hogan style, revealing his massive pecks, tight abs and a thick carpet of chest hair over it all. The growing slowed to a halt then.<br />
<br />
In stunned silence, the two of them took stock of Mark’s new ultra-masculine body. The formerly 4’10” tall 13 year old had grown into a 6’1” tall, muscle-bound behemoth. Puberty seemed to have struck him suddenly, with a vengeance, leaving him a testosterone-filled teen monster. His huge body was covered in hair, with thick patches on his crotch, underarms, and chest. His face looked more mature, already showing a clear 5 o’clock shadow. Underneath it all was the musculature of a professional athlete. He could have been a pro wrestler or football player. Though, what really drew the attention of both of them was his newly enlarged cock. His massive member hung like a summer sausage from his bushy crotch.<br />
<br />
Mark put down the remote on a nearby shelf and picked up his new cock. Even in his enlarged hand, his cock seemed unbelievably big and heavy.<br />
<br />
“This is awesome,” he said in a gruff, deep voice, as he gently felt up his thick member. “I feel like I could take on the whole world with a body like this.”<br />
<br />
Tim watched, entranced, as her friend felt up his giant cock. She stared at it hungrily. She had felt horny before. Now, she felt an uncontrollable urge to grab Mark and ride his cock forever.<br />
<br />
Mark looked up at her as she approached. She tore her clothes off, piece by piece, revealing the glory of her naked form. Mark felt his warm member stiffen in his hand, growing even larger and thicker, as he gazed at her massive breasts and dripping pussy. Uncontrollable lust flooded his mind in a surge of hormones. He wanted to fuck and fuck and fuck her until the world ended and his cock ran dry.<br />
<br />
Their eyes locked, and they were lost.<br />
<br />
They met, mouths pressed together, hands groped at each other, furniture tipped over, sweating, grunting, moaning, thrusting, penetrating, warm, wet, wonderful, mindless pleasure.<br />
<br />
Like animals, they went at each other, forgetting everything else in the world except for their insatiable lust and the pure physical pleasure they found in each others’ bodies.<br />
<br />

<br />
Across town, Carrie had arrived at Todd’s apartment, her first stop on her hunt for the remote. She unlocked the apartment door with his key and stepped inside. After placing her bag and Todd down on his own kitchen table, the little hamster that he’d become just sniffed around at the electrical equipment that sat there. Carrie flipped on the lights to get a better view of his place. “Whoa,” she said. His apartment was a mess of half finished electrical wiring, computers, tools, and scattered sheets of scrap paper with diagrams and mathematical formulae written on them.<br />
<br />
“God,” she said as she waded into the mess. “Have you ever cleaned this place?” She lifted up an old pizza box, and then put it back down, not daring to look inside. “I can see why you felt like you needed to invent a device to get you off.” She knocked over a pile of empty Red Bull cans with her big bare foot. “No woman would set foot in this place the way it is.” She paused. “Well, unless she really needed something from you.”<br />
<br />
She searched around his place for what felt like an hour, looking for any information that might lead her back to the remote. Then, she found it.<br />
<br />
“Well, well, well,” she said holding up a set of keys and an ID tag. She read the tag aloud, “Banes Experimental Reactor: Security Clearance. Todd Banes.” She looked over at the hamster. “Mr. Banes is it? You have your own reactor it appears. I guess you really are a genius.” She walked over to the hamster to look at it more closely. “Is the reactor what makes the remote work?” Hamsters don’t have the most emotive faces, but Carrie was sure that Todd had looked nervous for a second. “I’ll take that as a ‘yes,’” she said.<br />
<br />
She gathered her things, putting his keys and ID tag in her bag. Then, she picked up Todd and smiled. “Let’s go visit your reactor, Mr. Banes.”</p>
