<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mood swings, random sweats and chills, bouts of exhaustion, ravenousness at all hours, bursts of hyperactivity, and more was the joy of the first day. The changes during the night were extraordinary compared to normal. After the first day, Jeff noticed his body was changing. He could feel he was putting on weight though he remained lean and he could see his hair was growing faster because he needed to shave, his fat deposits were gone and his abs were now visible. His muscles felt tight and many of his shirts were too short for him. Jeff knew his growth spurt was fueled by his dad&#39;s mass and he smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff began eating everything he could, his appetite was edged on by his new organ and he was constantly hungry, however, his stomach wasn&#39;t used to the volume of food he was craving and despite his stomach being full he still wanted more. His new organ used all the nutrients to build his new form now that it was fully developed. Jeff&#39;s voice dropped overnight Tuesday which was a surprise to him when he answered a question first period. He gained more muscle than he thought possible. And hair began to grow all over his body. He soon looked and sounded like a 25-year-old man. Although his 1-week transformation drew some awkward attention at school he hid most of it under hoodies and used the credit card his dad left to buy new pants. Jeff was satisfied with his new body. He was in shape even though he didn&#39;t exercise and his body chemistry had settled back down to leave him feeling normal again. He was in his prime.<br />
<br />
After the week had passed, he felt the urge to empty his bowels. He ran to the bathroom but once he situated himself, nothing came. After giving it another minute he felt something come out and after another minute it detached from him. he wiped and discarded the toilet paper taking the cursory glance before flushing. The poo was white, over a foot long, much thicker than it should be, and moving. Jeff&#39;s immediate horror was replaced with recognition as arms began to form and the creature reached up to pull itself from the toilet bowl.<br />
<br />
Thoroughly disgusted, Jeff used the plunger and the toilet brush to grab the creature, dropping it into the shower and turning on the water. Jeff left the room revolted but decided to grab some clothes for his father. He had already seen his dad as a worm and didn&#39;t want to end this experience by also seeing his father&#39;s worm.<br />
<br />
Jeff made sure to grab a belt not knowing how much he consumed from his father&#39;s form. By the time Jeff returned the bathroom smelled of soap and motion was heard in the shower. <br />
<br />
Jeff distracted himself with his phone until the shower turned off and he heard his father scream in surprise. Getting up he went to the door. &quot;Dad, you okay?&quot; Jeff forgot about his deeper voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? Is that you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, who else would it be? How&#39;d you enjoy being in my body, Do you remember any of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, but listen, something went wrong with the return process, could you see if there was an error on the machine?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff snickered, &quot;Sure dad.&quot; Jeff checked on the machine and returned. &quot;There was just a little box saying &#39;request complete&#39;. I clicked it and there were no other messages. Get dressed and come out so I don&#39;t have to yell through the door.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a groan from within and the door swung open.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad now stood 5 feet tall and looked almost emaciated. His face looked boney, his hair looked thinner, and he was swimming in the clothes Jeff left for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you!&quot; his mouth fell agape as he stared at the relative behemoth his son had become. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I had the world&#39;s largest growth spurt over the last week. Everyone noticed my changes and it made things really awkward! It was impossible to hide my body hair and size while changing for gym class, and the voice change became obvious when I was called to answer questions.&quot; Jeff scratched his stubble for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jeff, I&#39;m so sorry... this isn&#39;t what I wanted at all!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m through the worst of it, but why did you set yourself up to shrink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want any of this for either of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure we can get you back to normal, nobody&#39;s seen you yet except for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff guided his father back to his room and asked for his height and weight and in a snap, Mike was back to his original height. The pants still seemed suspiciously loose and his build was off, but Jeff wasn&#39;t going to point it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was sure I read and did everything correctly, did you see what package I activated? Why didn&#39;t you end it early?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While the package was active I was able to see the details. I really freaked out when I ate you... but you said, &#39;just let it happen&#39; and I was surprised you wanted to become an organ, but when I started changing, I figured this is what you wanted from me. If you didn&#39;t want to become an organ, what did you want to become inside my body?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike turned bright red and fell silent. Jeff continued poking around in the Chronivac and feigned interest in one of the other packages to give him an out... Mike left the room without a word.</p>
