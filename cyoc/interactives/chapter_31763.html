<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Megan looked at the items she found, she heard the crunching noise of leaves and grass, sounding louder than it actually was from the silence of the woods. Megan knew that she had to be more silent than she ever had, holding her breath, hoping her brother would not find her.</br>
<br>Suddenly, she heard a noise come within inches of the hollowed tree she hid in. She realized that it was her brother sniffing her out! Megan did not move an inch or breathe, knowing he would hear her with his more sensitive hearing. The sniffing grew closer and louder, sending chills of fear through her body. Then there was a deep, sinister and evil chuckle, she knew something was up.</br>
<br>Stewie lunged his wolf hands into the tree, grabbing her before she had the chance to even open the book of spells. His lips curled in an evil and wolven smile, smelling her deeply.</br>
<br>"Hmmm... that smell is wonderful! Do you know how I knew you were in that tree dear pathetic sister?"</br>
<br>Megan shook her head no, scared more now than she had been.</br>
<br>Stewie chuckled, knowing that she was young and stupid. "I found you from your scent! I know what you smell like, what you really smell like Megan, not to mention I can smell your fear! It is definitely a distinct smell."</br>
<br>"Wha... what are you going to do with me Stewie?!" Megan stammered.</br>
<br>"Oh... I thought you could have figured that out on you own. I am going to dispose of you, before you pose a threat to me! You see, when the pillar gave me the ability to become this god-like form, it also gave me all knowledge about what is in the woods. I knew there was a spell book with a spell to kill me and all of my kind! The only thing is, there is a spell on the next set of pages that will give me the power to turn who I choose, when I choose and to give me total control of myself! I don't want to be limited to being transformed only by the light of the full moon. I want it when I want it! Thanks to you, you showed me where it was, as that was the only thing that was unknown!"</br>
<br>Worry, dread and more fear swept over her face with Stewie reveling in the aroma. Megan didn't know what to do, she was in the hands of her brother now and she could only hang there, waiting for whatever he chooses to do.</br>
<br>Stewie grabbed her with his left paw and held her under her jaw joints, keeping her from moving and speaking. An evil smile came over his muzzled face, his right paw unsheathed his sharp claws, and took one swipe across her throat, cutting through every major artery. Holding her still, her blood flowed freely, soaking his fur in her blood. As the blood drained from her body, he could feel her life-force drain out as well, and when the blood stopped flowing she hung there like a limp noodle. Casting her to the grass, her body laid there cold, lifeless and hollow. Stewie smelled the blood in his fur, invigorated by it, he howled in victory. Nothing stood in his way of obtaining the book, destroying the page that would cause his kind harm. Reaching down into the hollowed tree, Stewie picked up the crystal ball and the spell book. His left paw still covered in blood, the ball slipped in it and covered a portion with the red life-force. Taking the book in his free and clean paw, Stewie headed back to the rings, knowing that was the key and the probable source of his power. Stepping into the clearing, bathed in the clean light of the full moon, the crystal ball began glowing, but turning in color. Stewie stopped, placing all his attention on the crystal ball, intrigued by what was happening with it. The blood was absorbed by the crystal ball, swirling inside it, being pulled into the center and filling the ball with blood red light. Not really knowing what was going to happen, Stewie hurried to the central ring of stone, feeling as though it offered him protection.</br>
<br>When he reached the central stone, Stewie set the book on the stone and placed the ball on the ground. He flipped through the pages of the book, thinking that there would be an answer and he quickly found one, when coming upon the page about the crystal ball itself. The crystal ball was a witch's embuement of power, containing all of it until he or she was ready to take the power within them. Reading on, Stewie found that there was a warning, never to combine the power of the Wolven Rings with the Crystal Ball energy, fore if the ball was tainted by blood, the one who took in the power would know no end to their power. If one who was a werewolf, tainted the ball and consumed it's power, he and his ilk would not be able to be injured, suffer pain, sickness or even death itself. If a werewolf consumed the power, he and his bloodline would also have total control of themselves, able to change when they felt like it, no longer cursed by the moon or their emotions, having to be fuly enraged to change without the light of the moon. Continuing further, Stew found a warning, printed boldly with exclamation points at each end. The warning stated that the ball's contained power should never be loosed into the Wolven Rings, tainted or not, fore if it was, the barrier between his world and the world of magic would be torn apart, with all manner of creature and beast to run free, using magic with no care for the consequence it would have on the Earth itself.</br>
<br>Stewie was definitely intrigued, wondering what he should choose. Did he want to be immortal, being able to control when he could change and pass that on to those who Stewie made like him, or did he want to destroy the barrier separating magic from the world, freeing more of his kind that was trapped there along with any other beast ever created by magic, both dark and light.</br>
<br>Stewie held the ball in both his paws now, ready to make his decision, deciding to...</br></p>
