<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate waited all night hoping to transform into a werewolf again, except nothing happened. Disappointed, he <br />
finally went to bed. He had so badly wanted to turn again. The cookie had to have been a one time only type of <br />
thing. He would have to talk to Kathryn in the morning.<br />
<br />
The following morning, he saw Kathryn out in her yard working and walked over to her house. She looked up and <br />
smiled when she saw him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nate? How's it going?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's going good,&quot; he replied. &quot;So, about that cookie you gave me...that was a one time only thing, wasn't <br />
it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, it was.&quot; Kathryn looked around. &quot;Come inside with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathryn lead Nate into the house through the back door. She gestured to the breakfast table. Nate took a seat <br />
and she sat across from him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you wanted to transform again, then?&quot; asked Kathryn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I did,&quot; Nate could barely contain his excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;How come?&quot; Kathryn seemed genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I enjoyed it the first time, obviously.&quot; Nate was looking down at the table, almost embarrassed to talk <br />
about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's always been something I fantasized about, ever since I was a little kid. And it's not a self <br />
esteem or self image issue, I mean I have a healthy self image. Especially now, thanks for the recent <br />
additions by the way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathryn smiled and nodded her head. She gestured for him to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just would watch movies where the main character would turn into an animal or a mythical creature and I'd <br />
wonder, why can't that happen to me? That'd be so cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to experience something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting. What sort of movies?&quot; asked Kathryn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the earliest would probably be The Shaggy Dog or The Shaggy D.A, with the guy who turns into a dog and <br />
back randomly after he reads a spell on an old ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, I remember that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so that was the first and I could just imagine that, the white fur growing in as I slowly shape shifted <br />
into a big dog,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was Teen Wolf, man, I must've watched that bathroom transformation scene a couple hundred times. And <br />
then there was American Werewolf in London and The Howling, both amazing werewolf transformations...&quot; said <br />
Nate.<br />
<br />
Kathryn nodded again. She then leaned forward. &quot;Nate, I like you. I think you're a sweet kid. But I don't <br />
believe in giving away spells for free. I tell you what, you do some odd jobs for me around the house and each <br />
week, I'll make one of your transformation fantasies come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now each Saturday, you come over here and help me out with stuff and in reward, you'll get one of the <br />
transformations you described to me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a deal.&quot; Nate held out his hand and she shook it. <br />
<br />
She got up and walked across the kitchen. She opened the door to the basement. She walked downstairs and Nate <br />
followed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have boxes of ingredients down here for my potions. I need you to unpack them and organize them in <br />
alphabetical order on the shelves. Can you do that?&quot; asked Kathryn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; replied Nate, smiling. <br />
<br />
For the rest of the day, Nate unpacked crate after crate of different exotic ingredients and arranged them on <br />
the shelves in alphabetical order. He took a great deal of pride in his work as he arranged them on the <br />
shelves. The whole time, he kept wondering what transformation it would be. <br />
<br />
About halfway through the day, he heard a knock on the door upstairs. He heard Kathryn answer the door and <br />
greet her visitor warmly. He went back to work for a little bit and then decided he needed a drink of water. <br />
He went upstairs and heard the two of them talking in the kitchen. <br />
<br />
&quot;...I can't believe you made that kind of offer.&quot; said Kathryn's friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the harm? I needed the work done and it'll give him a few harmless thrills.&quot; replied Kathryn.<br />
<br />
Nate opened the door to the basement and walked into the kitchen. He smiled nervously at the two witches <br />
seated at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you came up for some water. I'll get you a glass,&quot; said Kathryn. She got up and started fixing him some <br />
ice water. &quot;This is my friend Marta.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, come here and sit down and talk to me.&quot; Nate sat down on the chair next to her. &quot;Kathryn was telling me <br />
about you. She says you like being turned into things. Is that true?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. I mean, she turned me into a werewolf a couple nights ago and I really liked that. It was only <br />
for one night though.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What if I turned you into something right now? How would you feel about that?&quot; asked Marta.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marta...&quot; Kathryn walked back over to the table and handed Nate his ice water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm still doing the work Kathryn wanted me to do. Why? What did you have in mind?&quot; Nate took a sip of <br />
the ice water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, all sorts of things. How about a big cat?&quot; Marta smiled coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, Nate's tastes tend to skew towards the canine more than the feline,&quot; replied Kathryn, sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really?&quot; Marta turned to Nate and stared intently at him. Nate started to fan himself and started panting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it hot in here?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marta, stop it! I have a deal with him, so stop interfering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I just haven't met anyone who wanted to be transformed before. I had to try it out. Usually it's <br />
no, please don't...I couldn't help myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay,&quot; replied Kathryn. &quot;Just take your spell off him so he can go back to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spell?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she was turning you into a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked down at his hands and saw the golden fur growing on them. He cried out in surprise. Marta gave a <br />
flick of her wrist and the transformations quickly disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Back to normal. If Kathryn runs out of work for you, come see me Nate. We'll have all sorts of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Nate, walking back to the basement steps.<br />
<br />
As Day became evening, Kathryn walked downstairs and saw the impressive work Nate had done organizing her work <br />
room. She smiled, seeing the clean, organized room as Nate put on the finishing touches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Nate, this is perfect, absolutely perfect. I love it.&quot; Kathryn walked over to him at the work table. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you liked it.&quot; Nate could feel his pulse pick up as his excitement started to build. She's going to <br />
transform me into something now. What would it be? He couldn't help but wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, for your transformation, what shall we do?&quot; pondered Kathryn to herself. He had done a wonderful <br />
job and she wanted to reward him accordingly.</p>
