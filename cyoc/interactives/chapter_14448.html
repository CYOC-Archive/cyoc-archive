<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two months after Felix Fairfax had changed from a willowy 5'11&quot; 125 pound milquetoast to a 6'1&quot; 170 pound athletic guy, he was going to see a movie with his friend Tony and Tony's friends Jeff, Jack and Eric and girlfriend Claire.<br />
<br />
First they had to drop off Tony's little brother Mark at the ballet studio.  There was going to be a representative from a famous ballet academy at the performance that night and Mark was excited at the prospect.  He'd been up late the night before painting some stage background pieces for the school's instructor.  Everyone grabbed a piece of background out of the trunk and carried them in to help Mark.<br />
<br />
They were all gathered around him, wishing him luck, in the tiny boys' &quot;locker room&quot;, not much more than a glorified walk in closet with a single showerhead, really.<br />
<br />
At the edge of the circle of Tony felt a mild electric shock but thought it was from putting his hand on the lockers against one wall.  He wasn't even aware that anything was happening, he was chuckling at something Jack had said when he looked down and saw that he was naked.  His clothes had disappeared like wisps of smoke in a breeze.  Jack noticed and laughed &quot;Jesus, Tony, want to get in on the dancing yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
The others all stepped aside and stared at Tony, mostly chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn't do this.  I don't know what's going on&quot; he said nervously.  And quickly, the smiles disappeared from the faces of his friends as, one after another, they felt an electric pulse pass through their bodies and their bodies start to dramatically change.<br />
<br />
Tony looked on in horror as, in just a few seconds, Claire's clothes disappeared, she shrank and her arms joined in front of her as if she was trying to form a hoop.  Her legs joined together and became narrower and narrower.  She continued to shrink and no longer had hair.  Her entire head and torso took on a tringular shape and her entire body became spandex.  Tony looked on in shock.  His girlfriend had become the supporter that a male ballet dancer wears, a dance belt.<br />
<br />
But that was only one of five changes taking place before Tony's eyes.  His brother became almost hollow and turned pale white.  Mark's whole body turned into spandex and he dropped to the floor, transformed into a pair of white ballet tights.<br />
<br />
To one side, Felix sputtered &quot;Wha-wha-wha&quot; before his body almost seemed to melt to the floor.  Then, Felix became turned to rubber and assumed the shape of a narrow belt, such as a ballet dancer rolls the top of his tights around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack?!&quot; Tony gasped as he watched his best friend reshape.  First Jack's clothes disappeared and Jack's skin took on a quilted pattern.  His face was an expression of complete shock, but then he didn't even seem to have a face, or head, or legs.  He seemed to be just a torso and then he hollowed out.  Finally, Jack took on a gold and white color and velvety texture.  Jack was the top that a ballet prince might be wearing.<br />
<br />
Finally, Tony looked over to one side and saw two thin white leather ballet slippers where Jeff and Eric had been standing.  He was naked and his friends had been turned into all the things a ballet dancer would wear.  Tony was furious.  The last thing he wanted to do was give in to what had been done to them by putting them on, but as he looked around the room, he realized there wasn't a stitch of clothing to wear other than his ballet wear friends.  And in the back of his mind was an odd urge.  He wanted to dance in that night's ballet.  He hadn't felt like that since the time when Emma Chase had turned him and Jack gay and made them both avid ballet dancers.<br />
<br />
He searched his mind for any hint that he'd had his sexual preference messed with.  But thinking of Claire, of kissing her and making love to her, his reactions were the same.  He sighed and picked up his girlfriend, now just a dance belt.  <br />
&quot;Sorry Claire but I have to do this&quot; he said to the little spandex garment.  And to his surprise, once he touched her, once he held her, the dance belt, in his hands, he could hear her, in his mind, speaking back to him<br />
~~It's okay.  It won't be the first time I was that clost to your equipment.  Just-just get me back to normal~~<br />
&quot;I-I will&quot; Tony promised and then pulled Claire the dance belt up between his legs so that the tight stretchy waistband was just above his hip bones, the connecting srap behind him tight between his buns and the pouch in front stretched tight, to its limits lifting his penis and balls and compacting them into a hemisphere in front of him.<br />
~~Oh god.  This is setting feminism back 10 years, being your ballet jock like this!~~<br />
Tony chuckled.  He picked up the white tights on the floor next to him.  Immediately, he could hear Mark's voice in his head.<br />
~~If you're going to dance my parts, you'll have to know how to do it~~ said Mark and as Tony pulled the tights up, he listened to Mark explaining all that he would have to do.<br />
<br />
Next, he pulled Felix, the thin belt up to his midsection.<br />
~~Tony!  What's happening?  How the hell did I become a-a belt?  Is this because of that chronivac machine?~~<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I don't know who did this but there's not much we can do right now&quot; replied Tony to his friend Felix and then he carefully rolled the top edge of his brother Mark, the pair of tights, over Felix the belt and rolled the belt over and over down from his sternum to his waist. In the process, he pulled the white tights up so that they had the expected painted on look with the seam in the back all the way up between his muscular buns.<br />
<br />
Next, he pulled on the snug prince's top that had been his best friend Jack.  It was just long enough to cover the roll of the tights that enclosed Felix, the belt, but not long enough to cover any part of Tony's magnificent, buns or impressive hemispherical package.<br />
~~Don't get the wrong idea.  I hate this and I'm not swishy for you, but this hugging you part isn't so terrible~~ chuckled Jack.<br />
Tony looked at himself in the mirror.  He looked good.  He looked exactly like a ballet dancer should.<br />
<br />
Finally, he slipped on Jeff and Eric, his two buddies now turned into white leather ballet slippers.  Tony expected to talk to them as well, but, for whatever reason, couldn't hear their voices in his head.  But from the moment that he pulled them on, Tony felt absolutely compelled to leap in the air.<br />
&quot;What the hell-?&quot;<br />
Tony leaped and spun and jumped out of the room.  He felt like his incredible body was out of his control.  He grabbed a nearby ballerina and lifted her over his head and carried her across the stage behind the curtain.  &quot;Oh Tony!&quot; She laughed and slapped his shoulder to get him to let her go.  The moment he did, he felt absolutely compelled to spring into one arabesque position after another, one leg then the other pointed out behind him.<br />
<br />
Tony tried with all his will to stop but found he couldn't as he immediately launched into a series of spins in place.  The school's instructor approached him.<br />
&quot;Oh, Tony.  I can't thank you enough for filling in for your brother Mark.  You look so . . wonderful in your tights.  The audience will love you&quot;<br />
&quot;Th-thanks&quot; said Tony still spinning in place.<br />
&quot;Now, let's go over your part&quot; said the instructor.<br />
Tony grabbed a ballerina going by and practiced holding her and lifting her.  It was the only way he could stay in one place and looking at the instructor.  With the help of Mark, now his tights, Tony recited for the instructor all that he was going to do.  She gave him a firm pat on his white tighted buns and then went off to deal with some of the girls.<br />
<br />
Tony put down the ballerina he'd practiced partering.  She was very cute.  And as soon as that thought crossed his mind, he felt his dance belt rub painfully underneath him as he took off on a series of leaps.<br />
~~Hey!  Don't go looking at other girls at a time like this when I've got you by the balls!~~ <br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; said Tony out loud.  &quot;It was nothing.  I just noticed that she's pretty&quot;<br />
~~Okay.  I suppose I'm a little more inclined to be jealous, what with being your ballet jockstrap and all!~~<br />
Tony smiled, but for just a moment.  It worried him that he couldn't stop dancing.  Ever since he had put on Jeff an Eric, his ballet slippers, he couldn't  stop leaping, spinning, carrying a ballerina.  He was compelled to constantly be doing some sort of ballet dancing every moment.<br />
<br />
The only time he felt any sort of control of his body was when the ballet actually started.  Tony danced Mark's part in excerpts from Giselle and Swan Lake and a modern work.  While the music was playing and Tony was dancing his part, he could stand still as required by the choreography.  But in the brief intermission's between dances, Tony spun and leaped backstage against his will.  <br />
<br />
The predicament reminded him of a movie, the The Red Shoes.  He could only vaguely recall having seen it.  A ballerina was given special red shoes and felt compelled to dance.<br />
<br />
At last, the performance ended and Tony lunged forward toward the audience with his arms extended over his head.  The audience stood and cheered.  Most eyes were on the only boy in the performance, a 6'1&quot; 171 pound dancer with the face of a model.  Tony joined hands with the rest of the dancers in a line and bowed to them.  <br />
<br />
But the moment he let go, he couldn't stand still.  Several of the girls tried to hug him but the closest Tony could come to staying still was to do a series of plies, bending at the knees next to the bar backstage while girls patted his shoulder!&quot; &quot;Great partnering, Tony or giggled and tapped his white spandex covered ass.<br />
<br />
At last, the representative of the prestigious ballet academy came backstage, but Tony never spoke to him.  He wasn't trying to become a ballet dancer, like Mark.  He wanted his friends back and he wanted control of his own body back.  He tried desperately to remove his slippers, sensing that they were the key to this.  But he couldn't.  He couldn't touch his ballet slippers to remove them.  All he could do was dance.  <br />
<br />
Finally, wanting nothing more than to get the hell out of there and with no other clothes, anyway, Tony pushed his way out the back entrance of the building.  He was out in public, on the street in ballet tights and top.  He tried to run past a nearby playground toward home but found he couldn't just run.  Every several strides he felt compelled to leap with one leg forward and the other behind him in a classic ballet maneuver.  He saw members of the audience driving by and most of them looking at him thinking, mistakenly, that he was overcome with joy at dancing.<br />
<br />
At last he arrived home.  He danced through the doorway with a spin and ignored his mother shouting after him.  He made his way upstairs to his room and used his bookcase to continuously execute a series of plies. <br />
<br />
He'd have to think this over.  He'd seen one face among those driving by that wasn't admiring what they thought was the beautiful boy in tights enjoying dancing so much he couldn't stop.  One face seemed to know what was happening.  Once face was laughing at him in his predicament.  Emma Chase.</p>
