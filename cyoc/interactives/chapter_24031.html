<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gregg strutted down the road to his apartment, attracting the attention of a good amount women and men along the way.  People were always admiring his big muscular physique.  Gregg loved it, he loved having so many options, it wasn't like he was exclusive with his boss by any means.<br />
<br />
When he got back into his apartment, he tidied up a little, not wanting Amy (his boss) to think he was a complete slob.  He took a step back and admired all the things his relationship with her had earned him.  The HDTV hanging on his wall was great, the expensive furniture, new computer, decor...  If Amy was spending time anywhere, she wanted her surroundings to be top notch, first class.  Gregg had gotten lucky, very lucky in fact.  He had great luck all his life but there was something on the horizon that was going to change all that soon.  Those smoothies he drank weren't settling very well in his stomach.  Something was definitely going on down there.  Gregg patted and rubbed his defined abs and turned on the shower.<br />
<br />
He stripped off his dirty workout clothes and stepped into the steamy shower, washing away all of the dried sweat.  He felt a bit of a tingle, it felt good to get clean again.  Just as he was toweling off his magnificent body, his cell phone started ringing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; he grumbled as he held the towel over his ample sized cock and snatched up the phone from near the open window where he left it.  &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Amy, apparently she was ready to be picked up.  Gregg threw on some clothes, a tight black t-shirt, designer jeans and a pair of flip flops, did some grooming and grabbed the keys to his Cherokee.  He was always a fan of looking pretty casual, keeping a slightly unkempt look that actually took a lot of time and effort to achieve.  He was always trimming his facial hair to a stubble length and keeping his hair slightly matted looking, but meticulously so.  Smiling at his attractive reflection, he ran down to the street level and hopped in his suv.<br />
<br />
When he met Amy in front of her condo building, he even went as far as to get out and open the door to let his sugar mama into the car.  She squeezed his bicep lustfully as he did so and wrinkled her nose a bit, &quot;Gregg, honey, missed a few days at the gym?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gregg looked confused, if anything he should have been more pumped than usual having basically just some from the gym after a grueling workout.  &quot;No ma'am, I just had the workout of my life!&quot; he replied playfully.<br />
<br />
As he shut the door behind her and got into the drivers seat she made a comment that he must not be eating right.  &quot;Oh, no bother, you'll get your protein at dinner.  Believe me, you'll need it tonight!&quot; she said with a purr.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the restaurant and Gregg, as always, was a little underdressed.  The stud followed the maitre de and his lover to the table as they sat down for dinner and a slightly x-rated conversation.<br />
<br />
All was going well except Gregg was feeling a little fidgety and his clothes didn't feel right on him, but Amy's lustful stares and talk about what tonight would be like got him theough the uncomfortableness.<br />
<br />
Amy's stares became less lustfull and more bedazzled as dinner went on though, not that Gregg was able to tell the difference.  Finally she decided to say something about it.  &quot;Gregg, babay, you look wierd, like you...I don't know, like you're getting smaller or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gregg laughed at first, then looked down to examine himself.  What he saw almost made him throw up.  His body was no longer pressing up tighly against his clothes.  His huge chest wasn't poking out against his shirt and his biceps, that before were straining against his short sleeves were now seperated from them by a decent gap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...uh Amy...I'm going to the little boy's room, I'll be right back..&quot; his voice cracked at the end and he cursed himself for choosing that term for the bathroom.  He hopped out of his chair and stumbled toward the bathroom, losing one of his flip flops along the way.  Everything around him was looking bigger than before.  Barging in and rushing over to the sink and mirror, he stared at a 15 year old version of himself.  &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Gregg winced at the higher pitch of his voice as he watched his reflection morph into a 12 year old version of Gregg.<br />
<br />
His eyes watered up as he went into a state of shock...</p>
