<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Coach, do you think you could help me get my deadlift form right?&quot; Kendall proceeded over to the bars on the three squat racks, starting to move to take one of them down and ready it for the exercise in question. Kendall had never exactly been big on exercise, and usually enjoyed more academic pursuits, but now... now it was pretty clear. His mind was more available to him, it seemed, when he&#39;d introduced himself more to fitness. Maybe whatever was going on here, it just required him to be more of a kinesthetic type than anything else. Along with the...other way of dealing with issues with his eloquence.<br />
<br />
Coach Mason looked in the mirror briefly and wondered if he was seeing things. His hair thicker, his muscles looking tighter and stronger than usual, even his skin looking more supple and appealing. Was something...happening to him?  No, no, he just needed to get a haircut after he was done at the school today. Coach Mason went ahead and started racking some weight on the bar once it was on the floor. &quot;Let&#39;s get you started at 135 lbs. That&#39;s one plate on each side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall started moving up to it, not entirely clear on the form, and he gulped as he felt Coach Mason approach and start helping his form with a few hands on movements. Somehow, as the coach outlined each part of the exercise it seemed more and more familiar to him. Each step seeming more natural to him. Kendall shivered a bit as he watched his reflection in the mirrors on the side of the weight room. He looked thick and strong - like earlier - but something seemed slightly more toned right now. As if he was starting to tone up again. Man he hoped so.<br />
<br />
He preferred when he had abs as opposed to how he was now! <br />
<br />
Once he had the form down, Kendall started lifting it up from the floor and all the way to just below his groin, keeping it tight to his legs. He was pretty surprised by the tight sensation in his ass, and a blush started to form on his face. Kendall went ahead and started powering out reps with increasingly apt form each time he did it - the first was a rudimentary recreation of the form Coach Mason outlined to him, and the second was better done - and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
By the time Kendall dropped the weight at 10 reps, he was feeling decidedly warmed up. And ready to handle some more weight.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Allison approached Dylan Spence and looked over at Ross, noting as she approached that Dylan seemed really enthused she was going to talk to him, &quot;Hey, Dylan, do you remember anything about how Ross made it so far so fast? I mean, a year ago he started training with the football team, and now he looks...well, like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, well, I...er...I just remember hearing all about how he got in touch with a really good trainer at the gym he went to. Guy helped him really put on muscle fast.&quot; Dylan then looked down for a moment, and asked Allison, &quot;Uhh, Allison? I think I got pretty fit lately. Do I look a little less like a dumpling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan, you never looked like a dumpling.&quot; Allison took a conciliatory tone with him, remembering how before this other students could be really damn mean to him, &quot;I think you&#39;re handsome, Dylan. Whatever you&#39;re doing fitness wise, it&#39;s definitely doing work.&quot; She did realize that whatever was going on was probably registering as more of a blessing to Dylan considering how bad he had it before. Hopefully he&#39;d notice before anything went too far though.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m handsome...?&quot; He lit up with glee and blushed again, looking away, shivering a bit. &quot;Thank you, Allison. I-I uh, I really think you&#39;re beautiful and I just uh, hope I can find a pretty girl who&#39;d be uh, into me...I mean if she&#39;s okay with it and all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Poor, shy little Dylan. She honestly found him kind of adorable sometimes.<br />
<br />
She was brought out of her conversation by the sight of Kendall putting on another two plates on his deadlift. She was rather surprised by how fast he was moving up in weight on that. 225 was not exactly easy weight. And she swore as she looked back at him that something seemed distinctly different. Maybe his actions somehow influenced his changes. So working out this hard was toning him back up. She just hoped he&#39;d be the same Kendall after all this that he was before it.<br />
<br />
Kendall speaking of whom was feeling the tight, burning sensation in his legs, back, and ass as he started lifting the 225 lbs weight. He had never known lifting like this to feel so...so GOOD! He&#39;d have to try it again some time. Maybe when he was free of any schoolwork. He grunted and groaned as the weight raised and he thrust with his hips, inadvertently accentuating a powerful bulge developing in his shorts.<br />
<br />
The nerdy lifter didn&#39;t even realize it until then that the sensations of the lift were directly making him feel distinct pleasure. It was like a rush of he guessed testosterone through his body. Every time he lifted and dropped the weight, he felt like he was getting more turned on. Fuck, he hoped he wouldn&#39;t cum or anything. That&#39;d be fucking embarrassing.<br />
<br />
Ross seemed to be watching pretty intently, and noticed Kendall&#39;s bulge becoming obvious. He grinned a little, anticipating something.<br />
<br />
Kendall dropped the weight one final time and let out a tremendous breath, flexing his quads as he finished his lift. He looked back toward Coach Mason, asking, &quot;C-Can I go for another...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just hit your first really big deadlift sets. Give it a rest for a little while, and err, calm down.&quot; Coach Mason looked down at Kendall&#39;s crotch, both worried and admittedly impressed. Despite himself, Mason found himself thinking that whatever lover this guy took, they would certainly not be going home disappointed.<br />
<br />
Kendall took a seat at one of the empty bench presses as the other students started moving around and doing their own lifts. He saw Allison move over and sit next to him, the more muscular nerd smiling, &quot;Well, that was certainly elucidating. I&#39;m sorry if I worried you with how much I got into that. I can assure you my commitment to academic excellence remains in the fore...fore...&quot; he caught his breath, &quot;in the most important spot in my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind you working on your body. Besides, it&#39;s a very, very sexy body.&quot; She traced a finger on his bicep, Kendall drawing in a breath. &quot;Just...don&#39;t be going full jock on me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can count on me for that. Besides, no one ever said a nerd couldn&#39;t be ripped.&quot; Allison started doing her own exercises, all while watching the other students going about theirs. She decided to directly talk to Ross once class was over - for now she took in the way class was developing. And the way the students were changing. Vince seemed to have his attention on flirting with another jock, who seemed to not know if this was joking flirtation or real flirtation.<br />
<br />
Dylan was trying to do some bench press, and Allison could tell he was putting in a better effort than he usually had in here. And at least for now it seemed the change was focused elsewhere. Dylan was as he was before he entered class here. Muscular in a more stocky way, and the enthusiastic dork that honestly started seeming kind of weirdly attractive. Dylan even went ahead once he hit a personal record in bench and did a little victory dance in front of the bench press area before taking a seat to do some light flies as a cool down.<br />
<br />
Allison hoped she could see Wes pretty soon - considering the two of them were partners in this. She just hoped Kendall didn&#39;t get the wrong idea - after all, as far as she knew, Wes was gay. There was no way that they could really be a thing, right?<br />
<br />
By the time class was over and it was time for lunch, everyone filed out into their respective locker rooms to clean up and wash off the sweat of the day.<br />
<br />
Kendall found himself going into the showers for the first time that day, seeing as he worked up more of a sweat than usual, and noted as he did that the class seemed a bit more touchy-feely than before as well. And just as well, it seemed nobody really paid the fact Kendall was visibly at least a little aroused any mind. Like it was somehow...normal. <br />
<br />
Ross was fooling around with Vince, that much didn&#39;t seem that unusual. Vince was either queer baiting or bisexual, though he had a girlfriend, and Ross was gay. But Tom seemed more built today and more eagerly showing it off. Yeah, it looked like a lot of the guys were kind of fooling around, even the straight ones. Kendall narrowly avoided getting a slap to the ass, and despite himself chuckled at the guy who tried.<br />
<br />
One of the other nerds named Gregory was rocking a six pack Kendall was pretty sure he didn&#39;t have a week ago. As Kendall showered off his sweat he noted his manhood, still half-hard from his experience that day, was bobbing a little in interest at the contact with the warm water. There was also the fact he was getting to be more toned again. He started to wonder a bit about his body. Maybe...maybe Allison had a point about these things. Maybe he needed to talk to her about these changes happening to him. They seemed to happen pretty---<br />
<br />
He walked out of the shower and saw his well built body and the towel held just above his groin. &quot;Well, I figure I can enjoy it a bit more.&quot; Kendall strode past some of the other guys, not noticing he was drawing Ross Jansen&#39;s attention as he walked. Fuck but his ass felt tighter today. Just looking at it in the mirror told Kendall it was definitely more muscular, and stood out more.<br />
<br />
As he started getting dressed, he heard someone say over his shoulder, &quot;Looking like the nerd around here&#39;s getting a pretty nice ass. Not to mention the rest of your body. Maybe I&#39;d like to get to know you a bit better. Show you some attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned once he was done and looked at Ross Jansen, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve been feeling better lately. Not to mention doing better. Thank you for the notice, though I am not interested in the sort of attention you may wish to lavish on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall finished getting dressed and grinned at his reflection. He was really fitting these clothes nicely now, and he looked forward to the next time he was due to enjoy a romp with Allison. Surely she would appreciate the thrust capacity his ass and legs afforded him now.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now.&quot; Ross whispered, and then walked off. Fuck if Kendall wasn&#39;t making excellent progress. Though it did seem for now that he was not at the point where his sexuality would change. Though Ross was also registering how oddly older Kendall looked now. It was distinctly weird. Usually, Ross figured the changes would make the guys into fellow jocks or something. But now, it was pretty clear that wasn&#39;t the case. Something...else...was happening to Kendall Denning.<br />
<br />
And as much as Ross felt like it should&#39;ve been concerning, it was pretty damn hot.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Well, with Ross heading out into his crowd and distinctly not looking like he was in the mood for questioning, Allison decided to rendezvous with Wes instead. She found him seated by Bryan at their lunch table, Bryan regaling Wes with some stories already. When Wes saw Allison walking over, he gestured for her to come over. Bryan seemed a little weirded out by this, but shrugged. Taking her seat and putting her lunch pack down, Allison looked around and said, &quot;So...have you made any progress on what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes looked over at Bryan for a moment, as if asking if this was okay. Bryan went ahead and sighed, speaking up for himself, &quot;Alright, if you&#39;re wondering who caused at least some of this, it&#39;d be me. But I had nothin&#39; to do with the people other than Wes and I changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you used some...method...to change you and Wes? What kind?&quot; Allison questioned.<br />
<br />
Wes spoke up, &quot;Now, it may seem kind of...odd, chica, but it&#39;s what we did. We uhh, we found a wishing machine over at the fair. We made a wish on it, and somehow, it actually worked. Our bodies started changing like you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison at one point would&#39;ve regarded all this as crazy talk. As something these guys were making up. But she saw her own boyfriend put on a load of muscle, saw Dylan Spence get a regular glow up, on top of everything else. So she just nodded, &quot;Not the craziest idea I had about this. A real wishing machine. Okay then...&quot; She contemplated a bit, thinking this through, &quot;So logically speaking, it would be easy to assume someone else&#39;s wish resulted in all these rampant changes. Someone who had reason and motivation to start changing people like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And whoever&#39;s responsible for this could well not even realize what their wish would do to themselves or anyone else.&quot; Wes added, &quot;Maybe we can try and find whoever did this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, honestly, I have no stake in undoing anything that happened to me.&quot; Bryan admitted, &quot;I&#39;m perfectly fine with how I&#39;ve changed so far. I&#39;m better off by far. But I&#39;ll help if I can. I mean, Wes is my boyfriend, and Allison...well, any friend of my boyfriend is a friend of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I tried to use the wishing machine to undo the wishes ongoing?&quot; Allison pondered. She honestly didn&#39;t like the idea of fooling around even more with something she didn&#39;t understand. But it was the only lead she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know how that&#39;d interact with everything,&quot; Wes replied, &quot;Too many ways for things to go really wrong, really fast. Let&#39;s not involve ourselves more with it.&quot; Wes sounded decided in that.<br />
<br />
Allison nodded, hoping whatever was happening to Kendall stopped soon - and that it wouldn&#39;t drive a wedge between them.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Later on in the school day at the teacher&#39;s lounge, Alex was eagerly anticipating the night&#39;s workout along with whatever else happened with Chad. But as he started grading some school work, Alex found himself staring a bit at Coach Mason as he walked into the teacher&#39;s lounge. Alex never knew the Coach to have such a vibrant appearance, and usually Alex found him more than a little bit inapproachable. But today he seemed so much more energetic. Still as broad and powerfully built as always...fuck.<br />
<br />
Alex looked at that powerfully built back, imagining the two of them pumping iron together at the gym. Muscles flexing as the bar came down, lats growing stronger and the back muscles all standing out. Then he could go ahead into the locker room with the Coach after their workout...and they&#39;d flex, and flex, and then they&#39;d jerk each other off like weight lifting friends often di---<br />
<br />
Alex gulped, wondering if it might just be the fitness and strength that guys like Chad and Mason had that made him have these kinds of vivid fantasies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Alex,&quot; Mason started, &quot;Get your head outta dreamland, I have a pretty interesting idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m all ears, Coach Mason.&quot; Alex responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was hoping to get some of the teachers together for a workout maybe this Friday. Would you be up to join us then? I mean, you&#39;ve obviously been getting really fit lately.&quot; Mason looked Alex over, though not in the way Alex found himself looking over others. It was pretty obvious to him whatever was going on was also affecting Coach Mason. Though it was really doing his body well. The idea itself was a pretty interesting one. Alex had never really been involved in anything like that.<br />
<br />
The older professor answered, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve not exactly got a record of socializing with other teachers often...so why not start now? I&#39;m good to go then. This Friday sounds amazing. Who in all&#39;s coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suarez, me, you, Mr. Dalton, I&#39;ll see if I can bring along any of the ladies.&quot; That smirk told Alex exactly what Mason hoped would happen after their workout. And honestly, with some of the teachers here being as they were, Alex could not exactly blame him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like quite a party,&quot; Alex said, &quot;Well, I have a workout tonight. I&#39;ll try not to blow out my muscles before we have our little get together on Friday.&quot;</p>
