<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is the alternate chapter of when Mike travels in time, only this time the world around him is being rewound except for him as his body was the only thing that was regressing.  He will move normally as he can witness his own change.  The age rank and the choice is between 2002 to 1973.  You are welcome to add if Mike goes back to a baby of six months, a newborwn, in the womb, or all the way back to before conception.  It is your choice.<br/>
<br/>
LuisJM</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was ready…  He was going to go back in time to a certain part of the past he chose so he can get a better life.  Choose his own goals, pick his own girls, and change his own future.  It is something he really wants.  He checked the door to see if his son shows up.  So far, nothing yet.  He could still be watching the game and waiting for him to come down.  Boy wouldn’t he be surprised of what he’s planning to do.  Looking at the yes and no option, he took one last look at around at the life he had.<br />
<br />
So far, at fifty years of age, he had an ok life.  Join the military in his mid twenties, got married in is thirties to a nice wife, have three children, a decent job.  It is quite a unique experience.  But it’s not much of an experience for him.  He wanted more out of life.  Change it completely.  He doesn’t want to live a boring life.  He wanted something exciting.  And traveling back in time to change his life is the only way out of this miserable life he has.  Will it affect the future?  Maybe…  But it will be all worth it.<br />
<br />
So taking a deep breath, he started to say.  “All right…  Here we go…”<br />
<br />
So he started to push yes on the button and a message appeared that says…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac! Enjoy your change!’<br />
<br />
As the message started, he wondered if the changes would start.  He looked to the alarm clock on the desk and noticed looked to see if there was progress.  But as he was looking at it, he could’ve sworn that the second hand was ticking a little slower then normal.  But as he was thinking about it, he heard the door knob turning and the door starting to open.  He turned to see the door opening up and realized something.<br />
<br />
“Shit!  Jeff is coming!  What am I going to do?”  By the time the door was fully opening, he could see Jeff coming in, but he soon heard his voice sounding slower and lower then before.<br />
<br />
“Hey dad!  What’s taking soooo looooonnnnng.  IIIIIIII Thooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhht weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee weeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeee gooooooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiii…”<br />
<br />
His movements slowed down until he completely stopped while his voice slowed to a complete stopped.  Pretty soon, Jeff became nothing more than a mere statue and was frozen in place.  Mike starred at the statue of his son and was confused.  Getting up from the chair, he investigated to see what went wrong.  He waved his hand in front of Jeff’s face and didn’t see any movement or reaction to him.  “Huh…  It’s like he stopped in his tracks…” he muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
He soon turned to the clock on the desk and noticed that the second hand is frozen completely with the second hand not moving.  He soon noticed that everything was completely stone silence as he looked out to the window to see what’s going on with the world outside.  It was then that he noticed that even the world stopped with cars parked on the streets, people stopped moving midway through their walk, and birds levitating in the air.  It was almost like the world was on pause and yet he was still moving.  To him it was completely surreal.<br />
<br />
But as he thought of that, something completely amazing happened.  The world started to move again, but only this time the world was slowly going backwards.  Even Jeff was going in reverse too as his words went backwards and moved back, closing the door and disappearing in the room.  Mike looked to both ends and soon found out that the world is going backwards.  He hurried to the clock on the desk and noticed that the second hand was going back as well, slow at first, but soon accelerated, increasing speeds until the minute and hour hands were picking up the pace.  He could see the image of Jeff in his room again, but didn’t pay any mind, instead, he was at his desk and installed the Chronivac in reverse, before getting the program and leaving the room.  His movements were much faster than before as he left in lightning fast speeds, soon enough, afternoon turned into morning, then morning turned to night as the room darkened.  He saw something whizzed by and turned to see his son already in bed, moving around in quick time backwards.  Just as instantly, he could see that days are passing by the second as night and day flashed on and on as flashes of Jeff came in and out of the room.  And yet, Mike was still moving normally and wasn’t affected by this.  But his clothes were affected as he turned to the full small mirror and saw himself with his clothes flashing, from suits, to casual wear, and his pajamas.  Seeing this, he realized that the Chronivac is really taking him back through time in a really fast succession as he turned to the calendar to see the Xs on the calendar that Jeff has a habit of un-xing themselves.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” he said in excitement, “The Chronivac is really working!  I’m really going back in time!”<br />
<br />
He immediately notice that the year changed from 2022 to 2021, meaning that he would soon to from 50 to 49 pretty soon.  He really needs to look at himself, but a small mirror won’t be enough to watch.  So he decided to leave Jeff’s room and headed to his master bedroom, where the full length mirror is located.  He needs to see himself change in every angle.  Leaving the bedroom, he approached the hallway and walked down it, seeing shadows pass by in rapid speed, course they were in reverse, so he can’t tell if it was his children, or his wife.  But he brushed it aside and keeps moving forward.  He also felt some energy returning to his body as his strides were more up beat than normal.  He figures that his body was getting younger as he was going back in time.  If he would’ve noticed, the years were going back by the minute, going from 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017.  By the time he reached his bed room, he opened the door and saw his king size bed, vanity area for his wife, a walk in closet, and an entertainment area.  Everything is changing and moving around in reverse as the day and night sky flashing on and off like a light bulb.  He could even see his wife in bed during the night hours and couldn’t tell if she was changing giving how fast the reverse time is getting.  But he saw the full length mirror in front of him and walked to it.<br />
<br />
It was a really old mirror, preferably an antique, passed down to his family for generations.  In fact, his house used to have been his parents home and great parents home, all the way up to his ancestors in the 1600s.  So even if he were going back in time, he would stay in the same family home no matter what year he chose.  Walking up to the mirror, he got a good look at himself to see what has changed.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, he was a big time stud with chiseled muscles, abs, a handsome face, and a full head of black hair on his head.  But after work and family, he was just a twinkle of his former self.  He has a bald head that goes back and a gray ring around what’s left of his hair.  He had a beer gut that sticks out, but didn’t register him as fat.  Muscles were flab and showed little tone, and his face was withered and tired just like any middle age man entering his 50s with sprinkles of gray on his well trimmed beard he had since his early teens.  But the moment he starred at himself in the mirror, he could see the changes slowly starting to be evident on his regressing body.  His body was slowly starting to firm up and he could see his gut slowly deflating in his mid section.  He noticed his hairline slowly regaining hair on the top, starting in the back and inching forward bit by bit.  He noticed a bit of his gray slowly vanishing with more black dominating the follicles.  And his face looked less tired and the winkles looked less deep.  Mike watched on and was marveled at the slow metamorphosis back in time.  “Wow…” he said to himself, “I never thought I lost so much of my young self for this long.”  He continues to stare at himself while the world around him kept going back, one year at half a minute.<br />
<br />
As he was watching, the world around him kept going back further and further away.  Already, the year was 2016 and soon went back to 2015.  Then 2015 soon turned to 2014.  Then 2014 became 2013.  All around him, his bedroom was altering as each year passes, certain items, like makeup, clothes, other items, disappeared completely as older items started to appear, even certain technologies like smart phones, tablets, and his entertainment system just kept downgrading to older models.  There were also pictures on the nightstand that kept changing as photos of his family kept on changing or disappearing into older versions of a younger family.  And that is the biggest change already.   See, Mike and his wife, Jane, has three children.  The oldest was George who was 18-years-old and was starting college.  Jeff was sixteen and in high school. And his youngest daughter, Katie was ten and was starting junior high.  Now, that’s to their father, they are going back in time and steadily getting younger as the days tick by.  So already, George is nine, Jeff is seven, and Katie is one.  And soon as the years go down two more years, Katie will cease to exist and the family will have two kids instead of three.  But it doesn’t matter to him as he’s willing to sacrifice his own children and wife to live a better life.<br />
<br />
Starring at the mirror, he could see flashes of clothes and casual wear he hadn’t worn in years.  But that’s not all he’s noticing.  Underneath his shifting clothes, he could feel his body increasing with muscles as his lack of working out was slowly returning, bringing him back to his prime.  He could see his gut decreasing and is starting to feel the muscles beneath it.  His own face was youthening up and looked less rough with his wrinkles and crowfeet were slowly disappearing in his skin.  The hair on top of his head was growing back in, filling up his bald spot as his shoreline was decreasing.  Not only that, but the grayness on his hair was darkening around his head and on his beard.  Rubbing his bristled chin, he marveled at the sight of himself looking ten years younger.<br />
<br />
“Man…  Look at me!” he said with his voice sounding less rougher then before, “I forgot how much I let myself go.  When time goes back to normal, the one thing I need to change is keeping my body in constant shape.  Don’t want to become this fat, balding man with no muscle and sex appeal.”<br />
<br />
As he said that, he already passed ten years of his life, around the time his youngest daughter was already unconcieved, leaving him with two of his boys left, who Jeff is already five and David is seven.  As that happened, something was stirring in his groin.  For when Amy cease to exist, he caught a flash of him being naked.  Now normally, he kept seeing himself flashed naked during the travel back in time.  However, this one seems to be far different.  For when he was fully dressed, he could feel his penis feeling warmly active, and was starting to gain a stiffy.  Looking down at his junk, he knew what it meant.<br />
<br />
“Huh…  Looks like Amy’s gone.  That means that once my sons join her, than my little guy will be back to its former glory.  I just can’t wait for that.”<br />
<br />
And it’s true.  Before getting married and having kids, Mike’s sex drive was at an all time high, with his dick and balls doubled in normal length.  But as he got older, his sex life got weaker with his member shrinking from years of masturbation and sex before meeting his wife.  And when Amy was born, he could no longer produce as his dick was limp and his balls shriveled up.  Now that he’s going back in time, he knew that his little friend is returning to its glorious state.  The thought of his penis getting back in shape makes him smirk as couldn’t wait to get it back to the swing of things.<br />
<br />
As he looked back at the mirror, he could see the years continued to tick away, going from 2011 to 2010 to 2009 to 2008.  All around him, items, pictures, and technology keeps getting more outdated as days tick back with some of the new furnishings disappearing with older models taking their place.  Yet he didn’t care for that, as he was too focused on how young his body and sex organ is.<br />
<br />
His body was pumping up and was hardening around him.  His once man boobs was shrinking and flattening into its chiseled look.  His round stomach kept on getting smaller as he could see his abs slowly showing on the surface.  Flexing, he could see the biceps bulging and his veins pumping.  His face was getting as chiseled as the rest of his body.  His jaw line became more hardened and square with his beard getting neatly trimmed as his faint line was continuing to fade.  The hair continued to grow as his bald spot was almost closed and the shore line descended downward while there were specks of gray on his hair ring and his beard.  He even noticed that his clothes were altering from less suits to more casual polos.  Even catching glimpses of strap tank tops when he still have muscles in his day.  From his guess, he was getting demoted more and more as he went back in time, meaning more leisure time for him when the time traveling and rewinding stops.<br />
<br />
Looking at himself, he smiled and said, “Look at that.  Miss that look in a long time.  And when I loose my job in reverse, I will see more of my muscular side more often.”<br />
<br />
As he was observing himself, he could feel a stirring in his privates yet again.  He knows deep down that he rewound himself five more years of his life.  That means only one thing.  Jeff, the very son that showed him the Chronivac in the first place, has been un-conceived.  It also means that David’s the only son left and is mostly a two-year-old toddler.  Once Jeff was gone, he could feel his dick getting erect and expanding more, dropping his balls further and the shaft growing a few inches.  Catching a glimpse of him naked again, he could see the difference between sacrificing Katie and sacrificing Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…  Didn’t remember my rod to be that big.” he said to himself in fascination, “Then again, it was a long time since I seen it like this.  Heh, heh…  Two down one to go.  And it won’t be long.”<br />
<br />
The days continued to reverse itself as the years went down from 2006, 2005, and 2004.  His body was nearing its peak in adulthood and his body expanding and gaining more girth and muscles.  Even at times, his clothes kept switching from suits, to polos, to strap tops.  There were even glimpses that he was either shirtless of was just in his underwear, just to admire himself in the mirror.  And admiring is what he liked as he could finally see his physic reaching his prime.  His chest, flat and hard with his nipples popping out.  His stomach is now flat and hard with his abs upgrading to an eight pack.  His arms and legs were bulging with muscles and veins and flexed them to see how good they look.  While not at body builder standard, he was looking real good for someone at thirty-two.  He could even see his body hair in a manscaping design with a wide patch on his chest, treasure trail down his abs, and a sprinkle on his arms and legs.  Even his face was showing that he was about to look handsome than the opposite end.  The faint lines were barely seen around his eyes and mouth.  And little creases on his forehead.  The hair on his head was just about full with an incredibly small bald spot and very little shoreline and there’s a speck of gray dotted here and there on his head and beard.<br />
<br />
By the time he saw himself naked in the flash, he knew that it means his little Johnny stirred and was immediately erect.  That leads to one thing, his first kid, David, is forever gone from this rewinding existence.  That’s when his balls grew and drop to the size of grapefruits and his shaft was over a foot.  When it went limp, he would see it was a mere six incher that flops around if not masturbating.  Looking on, he smirked and said, “Welp…  That’s it…  Three of my kids are gone and my big boy is back in business.  Now there’s only one thing left to do.  Let’s see what happens next.”<br />
<br />
Looking to his index finger, he looked at the ring he has on his finger.  This is the engagement ring he and his wife had on their marriage.  And now, it’s all going to be undone, because all Mike wanted is to have a new lease on life.  Going from 2004 to 2003, he could see his engagement ring flashed into a proposal ring.  Than from 2003 to 2002, it again flashed into a friendship ring, before vanishing away completely.  It was obvious that he met his wife as a blind date and it clicked on.  The following year after he proposed to her.  And then the next year after that one, they were married.  It was a quick relationship that blossomed into something more and now that rose budded back and shrank into the dirt.  Looking at the bare finger, he knew that he was back into being single.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the mirror, he could see that he went back twenty years of his life and back to being the pinnacle of being thirty years of age.  Gone was the flabby, weak, middle age man going through a mid-life crisis with a balding head.  Instead, in his place is a strong muscular single man with a chiseled chest, eight-pack abs, athletic arms and legs, and a huge package with a face of a Fabio character with a square jaw with no faint lines or crowfeet and a full head of short hair with now gray steaks on his hair and neatly trimmed beard.  Looking at himself, he flex and did some poses in the mirror as the clothing on him kept on changing from polos, shirts, and tank tops as the days and nights flashed each and every second.  Even when he wasn’t looking, his home was going further in the past as the pictures of his family were replaced with his own grandparents, mom, dad, and himself and the furnishings kept changing with older pieces and technology was two decades older.  Even the rooms that his own children had altered as well as Katie’s room became an old study room, Jeff’s room was once his old room, and David’s room was just a guest bedroom.  Now he has the place all to himself and even if he still has the house, he knew that he was living with his family as he could see blurs of his mom and dad coming in and out of once his bedroom, becoming theirs.<br />
<br />
Flexing at himself, he smiled and said, “Well…  That’s it.  I did it.  I’m back to before my whole life went downhill in twenty years.  No more kids, no more wife, no more ordinary job, and no more future going no where.  With all that out of the way, I can do what I want, date what I want, work where I want, and have fun while I’m at it.  Now all that’s left is to wait until this world stops rewinding to the year I selected.  Once that is done, the real fun will begin.”<br />
<br />
So he waited for this time travel to end as the world around him rewinds a day a second.  What year will it stop at?  Only he knows.</p>
