<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Slight edits made to chapter. 10/19/2018</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff trailed behind his father, hooves clopping on the floor tiling of the store, as they contemplated several units and shelves for “a proper razor blade,” his father kept repeating. A minute of reviewing prices and quality later, the razor was in hand, and they made their way to the deodorants.<br />
<br />
He continued to blush deeply from embarrassment. He wasn’t blushing because his large bovine privates were hanging out in plain sight, or because he had just pleasured himself in the weirdest way possible, or even because he had just paid money to fuck fake cow pussy.<br />
<br />
He was blushing because he had enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
He had liked the feeling of it.<br />
<br />
And his body wanted more.<br />
<br />
“ ...Can ya believe the Cubs aren’t pulling through right now? ‘Sfar as I’m concerned, might as well kick the bucket and get that yard work done instead. Yer ma is gonna pull my tail all the way to Cincinnati if I don’t start on getting those leaves cleaned up…” <br />
<br />
Jeff’s Dad rambled on about sports and “doing all the heavy lifting” while he had been playing computer games. His alternative memory told him that his favorite computer game was an exploration game where you captured colonies of men and led them through corridors to find groups of cattle to… ahem… keep the colony alive. <br />
<br />
As they went through the checkout line, his father turned to him and put a large hand on Jeff’s shoulder. He could literally sense the heavier weight of it, imbued with the strength of an ox.<br />
<br />
“Stud, you done sired once. Now ya gotta keep up with it. At least once a week. Understand me?”<br />
<br />
Jeff absent-mindedly nodded.<br />
<br />
“Ya, sir. Nothin’ like a father-son bonding trip to donate toward the bigger cause, eh?” He grabbed his credit card from the clerk and tipped his cap to her as he turned out of the store. “I bet you been lookin’ forward to this day for a while. Now, they let us know if any of it takes in a couple months!”<br />
<br />
Jeff just swallowed hard.<br />
<br />
“So be on th’ lookout for some mail, kay?” His father ruffled his hair and clomped out of the store. <br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t even want to know what any of that meant. But as he followed his father out the door, his loins stirred slightly, and he felt relaxed and happy.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The drive home was silent, save for his father humming along to country music tunes. Jeff sat bare-bottom, fiddling with the tufts of hair at the end of his tail, which wrapped around his side in the passenger seat. <br />
<br />
Having a tail was certainly fascinating. Like, he knew that only an hour or so earlier, he was without this part of his body. However, at the present moment, he was struggling to conceptualize what its absence would be like.<br />
<br />
Hooves were part of that conceptuality, as well. He glanced over to his father’s legs, which were controlling the brakes and accelerator pads of the truck. The pads looked a bit different; they must have been adjusted for the hoof’s smaller area of contact. At the store, he hadn’t reacted much to the unfamiliar men stomping around on their hooves, either. Sure, some of them were much bigger or rowdier, but it seemed like it was just typical dude stuff. <br />
<br />
But above all, he couldn’t stop thinking about the pleasurable experience at the siring clinic. It was like nothing he had experienced before, and his still-slightly-dirty bull cock kept reminding him of that experience. This wasn’t reality, but despite this, he didn’t want to give up this feeling of pleasure and desire. The more he thought about it, the more it frustrated him because he knew it wasn’t right.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment Jeff thought critically about the Chronivac. He recalled what he had done to create a world of half-bull humans. As it were, the transformation was specific to his lower body, and was male-specific (bull, rather than cow or cattle). He had set the parameter to 90%, but only God knows where exactly the remaining 10% was. Most important of all, the Reality Alteration option had applied his change to all other males, and life had adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
So he began to wonder… what would happen if he hadn’t chosen specifically a male animal, or if he had chosen a different species. What would that world be like? Or what if he had done something else, like just his head, or just his arms? Having bull&#39;s legs plus a bull’s head would be just like the minotaur from his video games.<br />
<br />
Or… what if he had changed just his genitals?<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. He needed to stop thinking about this. As his mind wandered and pondered, the truck pulled up the driveway and into the garage. Jeff climbed down from the truck seat to the floor, but nearly slipped and fell.<br />
<br />
His father laughed. “Aren’t ya ever gonna learn? Ya don’t have girl feet! Now go on, find yer mother and tell ‘er what ya did today. I’ll be out back rakin’ those leaves.”<br />
<br />
Jeff walked into the house and through the kitchen, stopping briefly in the family room, where his mother was sitting and watching some television programs. A quick glance showed a man with black-and-white spotted bull legs running through one of those obstacle-course game shows. He was about to tell her about his car ride, but better judgment took over and he moved on.<br />
<br />
He stomped into his room, closed the door, and waltzed to the computer desk, jiggling the mouse to wake it up from screensaver mode. This DNA Splicer change had been submitted and saved, so all he needed to do is cancel it and he would return to being human. In turn, everyone else would return to being fully human, the world would revert to normal, and he could look into using this tool on just himself.<br />
<br />
Or... <br />
<br />
Or he could just edit the current transformation and save the changes. He wasn’t quite sure what this would do, but it would seemingly just update his change to whatever the new request is.<br />
<br />
Should he do that instead?<br />
<br />
A bull’s lower body was purely power and sex, but a cow&#39;s lower body provided milk. A bull’s head and horns are used as social structures, and sometimes as weaponry. Different percentages of change could lead to less extreme realities, he deduced - but after experimenting with 90%, everything else would seem underwhelming.<br />
<br />
He also thought about different species that would be interesting to try. A snake didn’t have legs at all, so how would a world work without legs? And, for what it was worth, what about a world where everyone had the lower half-body of a fish, like mermaids. Would that world turn everything into an underwater environment?<br />
<br />
Maybe. Or it could kill him.<br />
<br />
Jeff wiped his forehead, just as he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. The clash between animal and human was still extremely fascinating to him, and he couldn’t help but smile. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t quit this, even after the weird experience he just had. Could he keep some of these changes? Maybe he could finagle the change to keep just the tail... and the genitals, of course. That seemed reasonable.<br />
<br />
But, then again…</p>
<hr/><h3>
He kicked the floor with his hoof in frustration. What should he do?</h3>
