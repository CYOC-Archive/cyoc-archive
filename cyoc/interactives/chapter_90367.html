<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Jennifer experimented with her body, she knew that the curse Kyle gave her, had much much more that what Kyle simply just said. She is now basically indestructible, and she could melt, and create body parts! As she even hypothesized that she could replicate parts of her body, and even shape her body into any form possible! Jennifer doesn&#39;t know where to start from, but since she still had a large amount of her flesh on the floor, she might as well start using it. She hovered her hand over the liquid, and a blob of flesh slid up her leg and onto her hand. She imagined the blob to become a hand, and as she clutched her new hand, she felt it herself. She added more of her flesh onto the new hand, and she had an arm. She repeated the process and had two arms, waiting to be used. She attached them to the bottom of her armpits with a slurping sound. It stuck there and she flexed it, responding to her commands. At first it was hard to control 4 arms at once, but she got used to it quickly, and soon she had four perfectly functioning arms. She went downstairs, and went to the kitchen to grab a drink, her arms reacting instinctively, her upper left arm opening the fridge, her bottom right arm grabbing the juice, her upper arm shutting it afterwards, and her bottom left arm already opening the juice bottle, drinking it. Whilst she was drinking, she thought of a few ideas that might work due to her explorations of her powers. She got the same knife she used to cut her hand off previously and chopped her arm off. She was left with 3 arms and a still working arm on the table. She focused on her stump, trying to regrow flesh on her body. She figured that if she were able to generate more flesh that possible, she should be able to regrow body parts. She focused, and felt a tingling sensation on the stump, then a slurping sound of flesh thrashing wildly, as strands of flesh sprouted from the stump like roots growing from a plant. The strands coiled together to form a large tentacle that was smooth in its texture and very dexterous. She tried to stretch the tentacle further as if it were made out of rubber, and sure enough, it stretched. Jennifer stretched the tentacle for a while until it formed a pile of tentacle-human flesh. It was coiled like a snake, and she could feel every fiber of it. She whipped it across the room, able to reach towards the tree outside of her house. She was impressed. She now could regrow parts and was elastic. Jennifer thought, she is basically made out of putty. She isn&#39;t human anymore, she is putty, she is clay. She didn&#39;t have any limitations as to her body formation, she could become anything she wants! She might as well be made out putty or clay. Maybe she is made out of clay or putty! Jennifer giggled at the thought, she could be a superhero or a villain! With her powers, no one could stop her! She recalled watching comics at a bookshop, and there was a villain named Clayface, she was basically him! They both had the same powers, being able to change form, able to withstand damage and even able to turn into a liquid-like state! But Jennifer thought she also had the basis of her powers, being able to detach her body parts at will, and still be able to control them. Wonder if Clayface could have done that? She then realized that there was still one power that Clayface had that she wasn&#39;t sure if she had. Shapeshifting! <br />
<br />
Jennifer pondered over the idea of being able to shape shift. Sure she could change shape, but she may be only limited to being the same fleshy color. She looked at herself in the mirror, and saw that her body was beautiful, speckless, with three arms and a tentacle. She saw this and shaped the end of her tentacle into a hand. Yet she felt that she wanted more. She looked at herself, more specifically at her breasts. She clutched her breasts, squeezing them, breast flesh leaking from the cracks between her fingers. She enhanced this idea and squeezed harder, then she let her breasts soften, allowing the flesh to squish through, pouring over her hands. She let go and flung the flesh onto the table, shaping all of it into a ball. Then she realized that she is able to shape shift! Previously, she tried to grow an eye, eyes require pigments, therefore she must be able to change color! She squealed at the revelation, since she is now a full blown shapeshifter! She is the real life Clayface! Although Clayface is a male, Jennifer shrug off the idea, since her powers are now simply awesome! She turned the mass she had on the table into a ball, then changed its color into black. Jennifer concentrated, and saw a dark spot appear, then it swirled, and just like smoke, dispersed over the mass. She held the black-coloured flesh that was a ball, and rolled it over the table. She separated it into two masses, and changed it back into a breast, and to her original skin tone. It did, and Jennifer put it back onto her chest. She then went back to the table and saw her extra arm. Then she reminded herself she still had the large liquid mass of flesh in her room. She willed it to flow down to the living room, and as she waited, the flesh flowed like a waterfall down the stairs, and into the living room. It was only one inch thick. She was not satisfied with the amount and created more of her liquid flesh. She concentrated her mind...</p>
