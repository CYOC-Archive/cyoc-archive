<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhere in Tim's mind, the reality of the situation would have made him resist the temptation but the crowd cheered him on and cock, while hardly an impressive instrument, was eager and driven.<br />
<br />
He shuffled right up to James who looked away.  His tail moved on its own to make entry easier for poor Tim and it was all James could do to shut his eyes.  Taking a firm handhold, Tim aim his meager member and tried to trust but with his virgin card still intake, he missed horribly.<br />
<br />
The good Madame, ever the helpful one, cast a minor spell under her breath that allowed the two pieces of equipment to match up perfectly.<br />
<br />
Both James and Tim gasped in a moment of pleasure but what feeling followed went in opposite directions.  Tim was overcome by the lust of his first sexual conquest and began to thrust with a fervor that the roaring group of men at the edge of the stage only cheered on.  James on the other hand, while he would admit, if pressed, to some pleasure, felt used and belittled.  His only way to protest was to try and remain quiet but every few thrusts Tim hit him just right and a gasp of ecstasy escaped only to be quickly bottled up.<br />
<br />
It was almost a minute into the show before people in the audience began to notice something odd.  Noting this, Madame leaned to the crowd and spoke low so as to not distract Tim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did say,&quot; she began with a devious grin, &quot;that coming up her brought with it some certain risks.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the eyes of the watching men, which had been on one part or another of James this whole time, turned to Tim as changes spread to him.<br />
<br />
The first was a pointing of the ears followed by a slight protrusion of the nose and jaw.  The men whispered and pointed as Tim's transformation cropped up all over his body. Fur sprouting and spreading along his forearms and legs.  His nails on both his feet and hands went black while a tail, a black wire at first the took on a plume of fur to match James', and a broadening of his shoulders.<br />
<br />
There was another change that, sadly for him, only James noticed.  As mentioned, the thrusts of Tim only sometimes caused him a whimper of pleasure as the kid was so small it was only luck that got him anywhere.  Well, the changes grew his meager cock both in length and girth so those muffled yelps gave way to moans and cries.  James was loathe to realize that, and for how long he wasn't quite sure, he enjoyed being taken like this and hoped this endeavor would lead to him being impregnated.  When he finally shook that scary thought out of his head, he looked back.<br />
<br />
Where there had been a meek lad was a male raccoon in much the same vein as James.  Tim's face filled in around his newly formed mask, his tail puffed out as the moment was drawing closer, and his nails dug into the stage for better support.<br />
<br />
James felt himself being almost pushed over the barrel as the strength of Tim had also grown and just when he felt he would fall forward, James felt Tim's hand tighten around his waist for one last thrust.  Tim gave a cry as he finished in James who also called out but with only horror as he actually felt the seed in him planted.<br />
<br />
When Tim finally stumbled back, it was only then he realized what had happened to him.  He was not as taken aback as James had been, for obvious reasons, but was stunned to silence as he stood there naked in front of the crowd in a new, furry body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give him a hand folks!  He did a great job,&quot; announced the Madame.  She took Tim's hand and raised it up as if he were a conquering hero.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, James had stumbled down to the floor and wasn't sure if his inability to escape was due to magic or just total exhaustion.  Tim's seed was oozing out of him and his legs felt useless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that these two have consummated their relationship, I think we should leave them be.  I'm sure if our lovely lass isn't with child yet, she soon will be, so let's give them a warm send off!&quot;  Madame led the crowd in a cheer as the stage hands came and led a still bewildered Tim off and picked James up and led them off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's gonna happen to them?&quot;  Asked a man in the front to which many repeated with vigor.<br />
<br />
Madame smiled and knelt to address them, &quot;Well two things.  First, James is certainly pregnant.  I have the inside scoop.&quot; And then she winked which caused jeers to rise up.  &quot;Second, they'll soon find themselves a little less human and a bit, well to be fair, a lot more raccoon.&quot;  She said the last bit with a cruel grin but did not let it linger long.<br />
<br />
She backed up and held her arms up and the crowd again gave cheers and cries.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, who is next?&quot;</p>
