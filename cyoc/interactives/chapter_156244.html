<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Afterwards, Jeff wanted to do what he always has done after a jack off session:<br />
<br />
Go take a piss, a shower, then play a video game on his computer. The piss came readily enough, but neither the shower nor the video game will ever come. He&#39;s stuck on four legs with no hands or fingers. Just hooves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaww,&quot; he tried sighing. He was sore. His ass was sore. His &quot;hands&quot; felt trapped and utterly cramped up. He couldn&#39;t stand up on two legs. He&#39;s stuck in his new quadruped posture. He tried speaking, but was unable to do so. He could only stand around with his four legged posture. That&#39;s hell ever be able to do. <br />
<br />
He looked back at the side of his long, gray, barrel-shaped body that&#39;s attached to his long neck. He would catch glimpses of his new tail automatically flicking in and out of view. &quot;This stupid new body will never allow me to do anything,&quot; he sadly thought and sighed with a &quot;HHHHAAAWWWW&quot;. <br />
<br />
He started feeling hungry, and the grass smelled enticing to his new donkey sense of smell. His mouth started watering. &quot;Oh no. I actually WANT to eat grass,&quot; he thought. He couldn&#39;t resist. The thought of eating pizza instead lingering around I his mind, he lowered his head to the ground like a donkey and picked up where he had previously left off when he took possession of his new body before his gay donkey sex session. <br />
<br />
He began mowing the grass, as his mind went blank while doing so. He was at it for many hours. His head lowered to the ground, and just grazing for hour upon hour in order to feed his new 700lb frame. <br />
<br />
By the end of the day, he had noticed it wasn&#39;t as bright out as it was. He lifted his head up, and for the first time in over 7 hours, took a conscious view of his surroundings. It WAS getting dark, and Jeff the Donkey was nearly blind in his new donkey vision with lack of most colors and in low-light conditions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot; he tried saying. &quot;Here Hhhaaww hhhee Hhhaaww hhhee hhhaaww,&quot; he said instead. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf?&quot; He thought. He craned his long neck backward and blinked a couple of time with his large, heavy eyelids. He could make out the left side of his barrel-shaped donkey body from his left eye. &quot;Oh I&#39;m still a donkey!?&quot; He thought. &quot;What time is it? How long have I been out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The taste of grass was strong in his mouth, and he was terribly thirsty. He wanted nothing more than to go into his kitchen and grab a nice cold soda. But donkeys neither have kitchens, not drink soda. Nor can they grip a can of soda even if they did drink the delicious sugary substance. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a fucking donkey!&quot; He thought. He purposely brayed, &quot;hee hhaaww hhheeee hhaawww,&quot; just to confirm it in his huge oversized ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god. This is real. I really am a fucking donkey! A stupid useless fucking donkey!&quot; &quot;Hee Hhhaaww,&quot; he purposely released another bray in order to make himself feel even more foolish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did I have to choose to become a god damn donkey!? What the hell am I supposed to do now!? Why would I even desire to be one of these obnoxious, dirty things?&quot;<br />
<br />
He released yet another bray, the humiliating sound of which made him start to get hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey,&quot; hhheee hhhaaww &quot;donkey,&quot; hhhheee hhhaaww&quot; <br />
<br />
He wanted to say the word &quot;donkey&quot; out loud, and with each bray, he would get harder. <br />
<br />
Normally, he would grab himself by now, but he lacked hands and arms to do so. He started becoming more and more desparate, and in this moment, he was glad he was stuck as a humiliating dirty farm animal, unable to grasp anything and unable to speak. <br />
<br />
He wanted to be able to speak and grab his dick, but was also pleased he couldn&#39;t do either. This was HOT! His huge donkey penis became a really long, stiff, black pole and would bob up and down. He would thrust his hips forward and bray.... &quot;Hhhhaaaaaaawwwwwww.....hhhhhheeeeeeeeee hhhhhhhaaaaawwwww.....hhhhheeeee hhhaaaawwww....&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a donkey! I&#39;m a fucking God damn donkey!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind went haywire, as he thought about the entire construction of his body. A body he took possession of from a real natural donkey. This wasn&#39;t his body! This was the body of a dimwitted beast that knew nothing about personal hygiene before he swapped with it!  Now he&#39;s stuck with a germ-filled, smelly body not of his making! <br />
<br />
Then his donkey cock exploded! He was so hot and horny with these thoughts and feelings of contradictions, that he didn&#39;t need the benefit of another hot and horny body, nor of his hand, nor of anything firmer than the air beneath his belly and around his cock. The force and power.of his humiliating, debilitating new life was enough to make him cum. The most powerful experience that rocked his entire being. <br />
<br />
He then enjoyed a blissful afterglow for a while, and became very tired. He yawned with a deep, long &quot;hhhaaawww,&quot; and thought about wanting a shower. He knew he wouldn&#39;t ever be able to get one, and soon, sleep overtook him anyway.</p>
