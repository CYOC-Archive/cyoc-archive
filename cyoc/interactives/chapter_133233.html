<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fred was shoved off the rear of yet another girl who glared at him.<br />
<br />
“Back off creep!” She shouted before walking away. Fred kept watching her and sure enough she began grinding agsinst some attractive guy across the club.<br />
<br />
“Swing and a miss,” Pryce laughed as he placed an arm around Fred’s shoulder, “Fred you do realize that guys like us aren’t attractive enough for girls like that. Why not try with some drunk chick, I saw one passed out near the bathrooms not too long ago. I’m going to get another drink, try again man.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Fred sighed while lowering his arms. He knew what the problem was, he wasn’t attractive enough. He had glasses on, had received braces rather late in his teen years, wore ratty clothing because he couldn’t afford much else, and despite what his mom had told him he still had horrendous acne no matter how little junk food he ate. At least Pryce was confident in his ugly appearance and didn’t seem to realize that girls wouldn’t give them the time of day.<br />
<br />
“Man if I were a girl I would totally give ugly dudes like me a chance,” Fred announced before he felt a pair of eyes watching him. He gazed up at the DJ booth to see the DJ staring at him. She smiled in a knowing way and reached downwards pulling a record up and putting it down on the table. The music changed and Fred felt the beat enter his heart. His heartbeat began to match the music as it pounded sending shivers and vibrations through his body. His body hair stood at attention before it began to pull into his skin and vanish. All that material seemed to go to his head as his hair quickly shot outwards into a shag of unkempt hair. Fred felt his eyes droop a little as his eyelashes expanded, his nose shrunk, and his lips puckered up. The braces remained and so did the glasses but as his jawline reshifted the braces decided to match it. He blinked his green eyes over and over until they became a sleep deprived blue that would likely clear up once university was done and leave him with gorgeous and feminine blue eyes. The acne almost seemed to get worse as not even the newly applied makeup could hide it. His shoulders caved in while tiny A-Cup breasts popped up on his chest filling with mameries and growing a bra around them. His shirt shrunk into a female version of the same top and showed absolutely no signs of wealth. Fingernails were chewy and unpainted, paper cuts and lead stains appeared from hard work in classes, and the waist caved inward in a feminine manner that would probably look nice if he had bette clothing. Next his dick began to trot and pull inwards making Fred a girl. She then had her rump expand modestly and hips expand in a similar manner, the baggy second hand clothing didn’t help. Finally her worn shoes a size too big shrunk with her legs and feet but remained that extra size too large. Her mind began to change as she lost her identity as Fred and became Frieda. All her clothes were hand me downs from her even older sister rather than her brother so the style was always ten years out of touch now and she held her drink in her hand awkwardly as people danced around her. A hand fell on her shoulder and she found herself staring at the girl who had told her to back off earlier.<br />
<br />
“Come on Frieda, you’re beautiful! You can pick up a guy here. He doesn’t have to know about your comic books, video games, and anime collection. Plus guys like that stuff, I bet a hot guy can look past the acne if he’s a big enough geek!” She laughed.<br />
<br />
“No I’m too ugly Penelope,” Frieda replied with a sigh, “I think I might go...”<br />
<br />
“Aw come on girl, I’ve been ground on by sixteen guys already, you can get at least one,” Penelope protested but Frieda ignored her and walked to the garbage can to discard her red solo cup. She reached for it when she bashed her cup against another and glanced up to see an acne riddled boy she’d never seen before.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry,” the guy replied drawing his hand back, “I didn’t mean to...”<br />
<br />
“My fault, I’m sorry,” Frieda apologized while grabbing her dropped cup, “I was about to leave...”<br />
<br />
“Me too, I was hoping to meet girls but without a wingman... I dunno. I’m just going to head home and play some Firefight,” the boy shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Oh man I love Firefight,” Frieda laughed.<br />
<br />
“But the problem is I never had-“ the boy started.<br />
<br />
“Someone to play with! I get that feeling. Penelope’s cool but she isn’t a geek.” Frieda laughed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I never had any close friends growing up,” the boy replied with a quick laugh.<br />
<br />
“My mom practically forces me out of the house hoping I meet someone,” Frieda laughed.<br />
<br />
“Oh I’m Pryce by the way,” Pryce announces holding his hand out.<br />
<br />
“Frieda.” Frieda replied while taking it.<br />
<br />
“Cute name for a cute girl,” Pryce replied with a grin. Frieda just giggled and blushed heavily feeling all warm and tingly at the compliment.<br />
<br />
Pryce looked at the dance floor and back at Frieda again.<br />
<br />
“So you said you never played doubles on Firefight?” Pryce asked while Frieda shook her head no, “I know this sounds weird but wanna come over to my place and play it?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Frieda replied not knowing that she and Pryce has so much in common they could actually be best friends, “That sounds nice.”<br />
<br />
Frieda and Pryce left while talking about Firefight and Zossie watched them from the DJ station with a broad smile. She shut her eyes and let some music flow through her ears happy she had improved their lives. When Frieda got pregnant and her acne cleared up she would look gorgeous and success would lead the newly formed couple to become gorgeous. They just wouldn’t feel bad about finding a loved one until their time to bloom came. Pryce and Fred would have been miserable until they began to look attractive but now they’d be together in a couple and happy. Price would start balding and then shave it all off revealing a handsome appearance hiding beneath and Frieda would blossom into a beautiful young woman. They’d be well along in love before that happened and appreciate each other for more than a surface level appearance. Zossie almost wished she could watch the changes happen but instead she just pulled up another record sleeve and prepared for people to get their groove on.</p>
