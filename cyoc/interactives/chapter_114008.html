<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well at least the pancakes,” Frieda chuckling; “are not as crunchy as they were the last time.”<br />
“You’re not going to let it go are you,” Benton sighing.<br />
“Nope,” Frieda smiling as she pours more maple syrup on her stack of pancakes; “tormenting you is fun.”<br />
“Well at least I managed to figure out how to use the stove,” Benton giving Amanda a dirty look; “unlike your mother.”<br />
“Hey,” Amanda growling; “keep me out of this.”<br />
<br />
The three were-panthers arguing was nothing new to Spencer and Eric. Watching Frieda baiting her parents into a pointless argument every Sunday morning was just as entertaining as watching the sun set for them eagerly awaiting the moment they could joyfully shuck their clothes and assume their fursonas while running around outside.<br />
<br />
“Maybe if you spent more time paying attention to Ethel as she uses the stove,” Benton waving his fork; “instead of social media on your phone, you’d pick up on how to do more than boil water.”<br />
“If it wasn’t for me,” Amanda responding; “you’d still be scratching your head on how to use the coffee maker.”<br />
“Wrong,” Frieda speaking up; “that was me showing dad how to use it. Not you mom.”<br />
“Frieda is right,” Benton chuckling; “our daughter did show me how to use the machine. Plus,” Benton grinning; “how to use the toaster.”<br />
“Then perhaps,” Amanda rolling her eyes; “you should cook dinner instead of Ethel.”<br />
“And afterwards,” Frieda chuckling through bites of pancake; “mom can do the dishes.”<br />
“Actually,” Benton speaking, laughing while Amanda just glares; “I was planning on getting your mother to do that while we have some fun.”<br />
<br />
“Like hell,” Amanda chocking on some sausage as both father and daughter bolt from the kitchen. The were-panthress looks at both Eric and Spencer; glaring at the young were-panther and the werewolf/panther/feline hybrid. Both notice Amanda’s gaze and snicker as they too bolt from the kitchen.<br />
“This is not over,” Amanda looking at the mess everyone left for her to clean up; “not by a long shot.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
It was an easy affair for the ten foot were-panther to catch up to his were-panthress daughter. Over running her as they both raced upstairs; catching Frieda by her tail as he stops his daughter from getting into her room.<br />
“Let me go,” Frieda squealing.<br />
“In time Frieda,” Benton smiles; “today is our day to have some fun. How about we go to see a movie together?”<br />
“But I was going to be with Spencer and Eric today,” Frieda looking glum.<br />
“You practically had all of summer break with them,” Benton’s smile disappearing; “a day with your father will not be the end of world little cub.”<br />
“But I don’t want to be away from Eric and Spencer,” Frieda getting nervous; “when Spencer had to go with her family to visit her mom’s family during the fourth of July weekend, Eric and I were a nervous wreck without her.”<br />
“Yet if I recall,” Benton looking at his daughter; “when Spencer did return, you three were rutting so loud that I was worried our next door neighbors would call the police to complain about the noise. And that would have been something,” Benton smirking; “since they are five miles from us. Believe it or not,” Benton stroking his daughters furry head and scratching her ears with his paws; “your mother and I were like that when we were just married. She would miss me terribly when I had to leave on business,” Benton watching her daughter purr; not realizing that her ears were an androgynous zone she, Spencer and Eric went for when beginning foreplay. “When I came back,” Benton continuing; “your mother and I had our intense expressions of love. What I’m trying to say Frieda,” Benton letting his daughter go; “absence makes the heart grow fonder. You’ll have quiet the fun when you three reunite later this evening.”<br />
<br />
Eric and Spencer arrive just as Benton walks away; looking at the three he says one last thing before heading into the master bedroom.<br />
“Get yourselves cleaned up and dressed; Frieda and I have a father daughter day.”<br />
Father Daughter day,” Eric looking at Frieda; “you’re not joining Spencer and I as we head over to her house?”<br />
“Not right now,” Frieda sighing; “dad wants to spend the day with me. Take me to a movie and all that.”<br />
“That doesn’t seem so bad,” Spencer following the two as they head to her room to share a shower; “at least he is making an effort. Hell,” Spencer looking at the grey furred were-panthress as she gives her pet snake a mouse to feed on; “after last night, I’m surprised your father isn’t smothering you.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at the Talbot house, both the kitchen and Living room was crowded with members of the Talbot family; Nate the only werewolf in attendance and doing his best to stick next to Jean. Both he and she in their fursonas while everyone else weren’t; not that it matter. Every Talbot was a were-lion and those that Leon instructed to guard his house and the shop heard Nate and Jean’s wild rut the night before and were trying to gauge if he was going to be a good person to their king’s daughter. Seeing Regina growl as a few tried to test Nate by trying to challenge him; most soon took the hint that the matter regarding Jean’s paw in marriage has long since been settled. The rest upon seeing the engagement ring Leon gave to Regina on Jeans furry finger, quickly knew that the two were more than just lovers; it was clear they were mates and what they heard last night was a husband and his wife coupling in an intimate and wild fashion.<br />
<br />
Being well versed in were-weddings and what they implied; several of Jean’s uncles and cousins took it upon themselves to congratulate her on landing a mate. Eugene the one family member other than Jean to buck the family tradition in becoming a grease monkey and work on cars was the first to let out a mighty roar. The rest soon joining in as Jean just listened while being embraced by her werewolf lover.<br />
“Okay,” Regina shouting; “now that is out of your system and you have all had your fill with my bacon and eggs, help me clean up. I’m sure Nate and Jean would like some more private time as husband and wife.”<br />
“How soon will you two be living in your own place,” one of Jean’s uncles asking.<br />
“What does Nate do,” another speaks up.<br />
“Enough,” Regina half growling; “leave the young lovers be. I’m sure you’ll get your answers at the next pride gathering.”<br />
“Peter should be well by then,” Eugene sipping some coffee; “King Uncle will probably want their marriage official by then.”<br />
“Dad knows better,” Jean looking at her cousin; “Nate is still in high school and I’m not even one year into getting my law degree.”<br />
“Plus a wedding requires the groom’s family present,” Regina looking at Eugene; “an issue Leon will need to address once Nate graduates high school.”<br />
“I feel like I’m about to be eaten alive,” Nate gulping.<br />
“Well you did step into a lion’s den,” Jean chuckling; “but don’t worry. The only one eating you will be me.”<br />
<br />
All the Talbots present and within ear shot heard that and couldn’t help but laugh as Jean takes Nate upstairs to her room. Pushing him onto the bed; her tail twitching as she joins him. Placing a paw on his furry thigh, purring as she slowly moves closer to his furry scrotum.<br />
“Now now,” Nate stopping Jean before they get going with something they both enjoy doing; “as much as I like your style of foreplay, I do need to get ready for work.”<br />
“Just as long as you hold to your promise in snuggling next to me all day tomorrow,” Jean purring.<br />
“You still owe me an explanation in why this Labor Day Picnic is such a big deal here.”<br />
“It’s simple,” Jean getting up; “it’s the only time of the year we weres can be in our fursona during the day without breaking all the were laws. But only at the designated picnic grounds by the lake.”</p>
