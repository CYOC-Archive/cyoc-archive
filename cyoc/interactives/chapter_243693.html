<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Skeesy was on the outskirts of the city before he noticed anything astray. At first he didn&#39;t understand the significance of it. Something tickled the back of his neck. Thinking it a fly or other insect he flicked at the irritation. He was surprised to find it was hair that had tickled him. That didn&#39;t make sense as he had only recently had a haircut. Perhaps the slut who did it (one of his girls claimed to have formerly been an apprentice hairdresser) had somehow missed a lock? Skeesy was annoyed but not alarmed. The lights changed and he accelerated off. <br />
<br />
Skeesy wasn&#39;t very tall, only an inch taller than Jordan, so he didn&#39;t at first notice his bodies dimensions changing. He was still able to reach the pedals and the mirrors were still in a good enough position for him to use them. He didn&#39;t notice as his sleeves became looser as his arm muscles diminished and the seat-belt became just slightly tighter as his chest began to develop. <br />
<br />
He was 20 minutes into his change before he realised something was wrong. The hands grasping the steering wheel in front of him were not his. They were finer and dare he say feminine. Alarmed he pulled over to the side of the road and looked at his reflection in the rear-view mirror. He gasped. His reflection was not his. His voice was not his own. The gasp was high pitched. He was somehow changing. He felt his chest. It appeared he was developing breasts. This couldn&#39;t be real. He couldn&#39;t be turning into a woman. He must be hallucinating.<br />
..........<br />
The original Jordan kissed the boy. She had two motives for doing so. Firstly she realised that she and Sam needed help. She knew she was good looking and the promise of sex with her would get guys to do anything.  Sam was unlikely to kiss one of the guys so she decided it had to be her. Secondly she also needed to hide her face. Her own body had just run out onto the street stark naked, yelling &quot;Stop! Stop that car! Thief!&quot; by kissing the guy she hid her face. She didn&#39;t want to be recognised. She just hoped Sam had also seen the danger.<br />
<br />
There was soon quite a commotion. The guys had seen the naked woman and were drawn towards her like bees to honey. Even the guy Jordan had kissed was temporarily distracted. Jordan grasped Sam&#39;s hand and led her back behind the tree trunk. &quot;We can&#39;t let her see us. She will know we had something to do with Skeesy being here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s she yelling about?&quot; asked Sam<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say she caught Skeesy in the house and chased him out&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s calling him a thief. Do you think he found the medallion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully. But why did he leave us here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was been chased. She has probably called the police. If she hasn&#39;t one of the neighbours would have. I&#39;d imagine he would want to be as far away from here as possible&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just hide here and wait for those guys to come back. They might find out what is going on&quot;<br />
<br />
From their hiding spot they watched. Someone had provided the imposter with a blanket. Jordan&#39;s body was at least covered. A crowd had gathered around her. Of Sam&#39;s imposter there was no sign. They had seen him walking away from the house earlier, fortunately not past where the twins were hiding but towards the shopping centre at the other end of the street. He had not returned.<br />
<br />
Eventually the police came, sirens blazing. That seemed to be an incentive for the three guys who had been hassling them to return. The guy Jordan had kissed spoke first &quot;Glad to see you are still here. You liked that kiss did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan smiled back &quot;It showed potential. Maybe you are not such a little boy after all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m all man lady&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What was that commotion all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That woman found an intruder in her house. He stole some jewellery from her. She was hysterical, muttering about some medallion. It must be some sort of family heirloom. She seemed devastated&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan looked at Sam and raised her eyebrows. &quot;So earlier you offered to help us. Does that still stand?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe another kiss will convince me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; asked one of the other guys. &quot;Do I get a kiss as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be up to Sam. Convince her&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam blushed but after a pause said &quot;Only if you promise to get us to Barracuda Beach&quot; She knew they were desperate<br />
<br />
&quot;Barracuda beach? That&#39;s hours away. When do you need to get there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight. We have a room at the Milton resort&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan explained further &quot;It&#39;s where we were headed. That guy was going to give us a lift, at least part way. We didn&#39;t know he was a thief. He told us to wait for him. That&#39;s why we were sitting here&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan&#39;s boyfriend was the first to respond.He approached Jordan and once more gave her a long passionate kiss, however when it was finally over he admitted. &quot;I&#39;d love to take you to Barracuda beach but I don&#39;t own a car. These two do though&quot;<br />
<br />
The second guy who had also wanted a kiss said &quot;I&#39;m working tonight. Can&#39;t do it&quot; he sounded disappointed<br />
<br />
The third guy who had been much quieter than the other two said &quot;I have a car and could get you both there, but I would need to be convinced also&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan looked at Sam expectantly.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly Sam approached the guy. He could not have been more than twenty. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear you need convincing&quot; She stood there in front of the guy expectantly. To be honest with herself the idea of kissing the guy was not as repulsive as it should have been. It seemed that along with the body she had inherited female sexual preferences and the guy was actually quite good looking.<br />
<br />
The guy didn&#39;t wait for a further invitation. He wrapped his arms around Sam and put his mouth to hers</p>
