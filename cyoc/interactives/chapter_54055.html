<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>With Jeff’s clawed hand firmly grasped, his mother began leading him to the living 
room where his dad and older brother sat watching a football game. Jeff didn’t understand 
why his mother was so intent on showing him off, but he assumed she wanted to scare 
them since she was known to be a prankster of sorts. Following his mother, since he 
thought he had little choice, Jeff still wondered what she was up to. Jeff felt that little good 
could come from putting a werewolf before his other family members. Jeff thought that his 
dad and brother could have scared her good and this was payback, which would be pretty 
funny since Jeff really was a werewolf, for now at least.</Br>
<Br>At the bottom of the stairs, his mother stopped and Jeff did the same. Where they 
were was the perfect place to stage surprise events, since both of them were obscured by 
the dividing wall from the living room to the main hall. Looking back to Jeff, who stood 
there with a raised brow, she chuckled silently. She then made motions with her hands as 
instructions for Jeff to follow. First, she motioned for him to silently go down the stairs, 
then growl loudly. Then, when his father and brother went to make a move, Jeff would rush 
in and scare the crap out of them and then she would come in while pointing and laughing 
at their expressions. It figured that she was up to no good, but at least he wasn’t at the 
butt of the joke as well. Jeff knew his father and brother to be macho men, so it would be 
interesting to see their reaction. The only thing was, Jeff knew that there were two .308 
rifles in the living room since they were avid hunters and he just hoped that he would not 
get shot because of his mother.</Br>
<Br>Jeff’s mom watched the two in the living room intently, ensuring that they would not 
know what was coming and when she was satisfied, she motioned for Jeff to get going. 
Slowly, on the balls of his wolfish feet, Jeff moved silently as if he were stalking some sort 
of menacing prey. Still oblivious to what was going on, the two watched the game and Jeff 
decided to up the ante a bit. Jeff growled loudly while he hid around the corner of the 
opening and motioned for his mother to go in the room as well. As she walked in, catching 
on to what he was up to, Jeff growled again, louder and longer than just before. Playing into 
it all, Jeff’s mom knew she was up to bat once more.</Br>
<Br>“Hey, did you guys hear that? Sounds like some dangerous animal outside.”</Br>
<Br>“Helen, what in the world are you talking about? I didn’t hear a damned thing and you 
are taking me away from one of the biggest games in a long time!”</Br>
<Br>“Pete, I could have sworn I heard something” Which she said louder, which Jeff knew 
he should make some loud noise.</Br>
<Br>With a bit of gusto, Jeff howled at the top of his lungs which made everyone jump, 
including his mother.</Br>
<Br>“What in the Sam hell was that?”</Br>
<Br>“See, I told you Pete! There is something outside of the house!”</Br>
<Br>“Helen, that don’t sound like it was outside… sounds like it was inside the house 
somewhere.”</Br>
<Br>“Well, how do you think an animal that sounded like that could have gotten inside the 
house.”</Br>
<Br>“Helen, I don’t know. What I do know is that if that animal tries to attack us, it has 
another thing coming.”</Br>
<Br>Helen paused for a second, knowing that Jeff was right around the corner and was 
sure that he heard what his father said. She wasn’t sure if this was such a great and funny 
idea anymore. Pete was now on his high alert and Ben was just a notch below his father’s 
intensity, so things could go wrong quickly. Knowing the Jeff would be able to understand 
her coded message, Helen made a nondescript comment.</Br>
<Br>“Well… go ahead and do what you think is best, if it is needed… of course.”</Br>
<Br>Back with Jeff, hearing the entire conversation, Jeff pondered what his next move was 
going to be. Would he go out there, scare them and laugh? Would he go out there, scare 
them and get shot? Would he go out there, watch his family go for their guns and keep 
them both from shooting him the best way he could? The possibilities were endless, since 
the situation could change at a moments notice and all he could do was wait and see what 
the reaction would be. He knew that no matter what, he would be fine since werewolves 
were immortal and he would heal pretty quickly from any injuries that he would be inflicted 
with. With that in mind, Jeff growled as loudly as he could, jumped into view which startled 
Pete and Ben, then rushed towards them as if he was going to attack. Catching them 
completely off guard, Jeff stopped in his tracks as looks of complete horror was upon their 
two faces.</Br>
<Br>Looking toward his mother, she just pointed and busted out in laughter.</Br>
<Br>“Wha… what the hell Helen?! How is this funny?”</Br>
<Br>“Oh man, you two should see the look on your faces right now!”</Br>
<Br>“Mom, seriously, there is a blood thirsty werewolf just waiting for us to make a move 
to eviscerate us and you think it is funny?!”</Br>
<Br>“It is when the werewolf is your brother and this was payback for the shit you two 
pulled on me a couple days ago, which almost gave me a heart attack.”</Br>
<Br>“You… you mean that is Jeff!?”</Br>
<Br>“Yes honey, that is your son Jeff. I turned him into a werewolf using the chronovac to 
scare the shit out of you both. From the looks of things, we did a good job at it too!”</Br>
<Br>“Alright, if that really is Jeff, let me see his face!”</Br>
<Br>“I… I don’t know if he can change back into his old self without using the chronovac. I 
completely changed his appearance and I think it is permanent until I use the chronovac to 
change him back.”</Br>
<Br>“Well Helen… if that creature does not prove himself to be our son Jeff in the next 
couple of minutes, Ben and I will do our best to pump him full of lead and take him 
out.”</Br>
<Br>“Hey Pete, remember he is a werewolf nonetheless, so if you have silver bullets, you 
would do well. I don’t think you have any of those laying around in the near vicinity, so my 
guess is that you wont be able to harm him like you want.”</Br>
<Br>“Damn it woman, the creature didn’t need to know that we didn’t have anything to kill 
it with. Still, I would really like to see proof that it is Jeff because I find it a little strange 
that this creature hasn’t done anything more than what it has.”</Br>
<Br>Helen looked at Jeff and smiled. “Alright honey, if you can, change back into your 
normal self.”</Br>
<Br>Jeff looked at his mother with a slight bit of concern, not knowing if he could even do 
that, but it would be cool if he could on his own. Thinking about being human, Jeff focused 
as best he could and slowly felt a tingle course throughout his entire body. The 
transformation that he underwent only minutes ago felt like they were going in reverse, 
and as he was under the feeling, his family watched in amazement as the werewolf turned 
back into Jeff, the boy they all knew. When Jeff was human again, or so they all thought, he 
stood there in the clothes that became tattered from his original transformation. 
Astounded, they all stood there in silence for a few seconds. Both Pete and Ben were 
stunned by his transformation before them, since neither of them thought that it was even 
possible to have something like that happen. Jeff was just amazed that the experience that 
he had was that of an actual werewolf, changing back and forth between forms was 
amazing. Now that he was human again, he felt a bit sad since he was not a werewolf any 
longer.</Br>
<Br>“Jeff, how did you do that?”</Br>
<Br>“Just like mom said, she turned me into a werewolf using the chronovac.”</Br>
<Br>“Can that turn the subject into anything a person wants?”</Br>
<Br>“Yeah, I suppose so. Why, do you want to try something out dad?”</Br>
<Br>“I think it would be interesting to become that which we hunt, to understand their 
movements and their instincts so that Ben and I can become some of the best hunters 
around.”</Br>
<Br>“Dad… I really don’t think that is a good idea. I mean, if you turn into a buck, then 
run around in the woods with other deer, you could be shot and killed. You could be 
blinded by a car, be hit and killed. The only safe form to take, in all honesty, is the same 
one I did so that if you were injured, it wouldn’t matter because it would heal up right 
away or much quicker. Things that would kill one of us, only damages a werewolf for a 
short period of time.”</Br>
<Br>Pete sighed, knowing that his son was right. It would be a bad idea, since they have 
heard about several guys getting killed by hunters who weren’t paying attention, let alone 
being turned into an animal and having an even higher chance of being killed with 
absolutely no repercussions to the person who did the shooting in the first place.</Br>
<Br>“Alright Jeff, you are right. Why don’t you go back upstairs and enjoy that chronovac 
some more?”</Br>
<Br>Jeff smiled from pointed ear to pointed ear, having wanted to check out the chronovac 
since his mom used it to make him what he wanted to be for so long. Jeff was very curious 
about what the program could really do! Jeff ran out of the living room, up the stairs and 
into his bedroom. Immediately in the doorway Jeff could see his computer screen and there 
was a blinking message on it. When he approached his computer, Jeff’s eyes went wide and 
his heart soared.</Br>
<Br>The message read: <Strong>Warning – Permanent Species Alteration. The subject is 
permanently the species requested due to the combination of human and animal 
hybridization. No further alterations can be made to the subjects species 
type.</Strong></Br>
<Br>Once Jeff clicked the “Ok” button, he knew he got what he wanted. Jeff truly wanted to 
be a werewolf, well… now he really was one.</Br>
<Br>After the message went away, Jeff noticed a few new options.<Br>
<Br><Strong>WEREWOLF PHEREMONE LEVEL: 1</Strong> (increasing this number will 
cause all men to want to be a werewolf)</Br>
<Br><Strong>WEREWOLF ATTRACTION LEVEL: 1</Strong> (increasing this number will 
cause all men to want to have sexual intimacy with other werewolves)</Br>
<Br><Strong>WEREWOLF DESIRES: Gay</Strong> (this is not adjustable. While in werewolf 
form, the subject will only have physical intimacy with male werewolves. In human form, 
they will be as the previous setting states.)</Br>
<Br>Jeff knew that this could get very interesting and possibly a bit dangerous.</Br></p>
