<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the hell guys? You wiped pre on me? Nasty!&quot;, Alex yelled while cupping his balls, Getting the other jocks sticky musky pre all over his fingers (and there was a lot of it). As Alex tried to wipe the sticky goop off his balls, Cameron made a noise next to Alex. It was a deep throaty moan. The beer was doing something to Cameron!<br />
<br />
Cameron could feel the beer affecting his mind. His thinking slowed and his muscles and body began to hurt. He started to grow a bit taller, slowly but surely. His muscles slowly starting to bulge outwards. As this was happening, however, a layer of fat was spreading over Cameron&#39;s body. It grossed him out. He didn&#39;t want to be fat!<br />
<br />
Alex felt a sharp pain in his balls. Like he had been kicked! He doubled over and grabbed his groin. Much to his dismay, there was a lot more to grab down there! He peaked into his jeans and saw large egg sized balls, almost totally hidden in a jungle of brown pubic hairs. His dick, likewise, was growing ever so slowly, snaking its way though his new pubic bush and down one of his pant legs.<br />
<br />
Cameron&#39;s whole body ached. He grunted as he felt his Adams apple push through his throat. His grunting deepened dramatically, leaving him permanently with a masculine baritone. His muscles were getting stronger and bulged out more, as his stomach got bigger and he added more weight and height to his body. He was approaching 6 feet tall and 230 pounds.<br />
<br />
Alex, however, still had his old boyish frame, albeit with rather large protruding armpit bushes. He was desperately fumbling with his belt. His balls and cock were straining the fabric of his jeans obscenely. He grunted as he forced the jeans down to his knees. His whitey tighteys were tented obscenely. He must have been 8 inches now, with much bigger balls than before. His manhood was now surrounded by a huge bush of hair, comparable to Simon&#39;s now! He sighed in relief as his new appendage flopped out. It was then that Alex noticed something else. His chest now had brown hairs squirming out of the center and around his nipples. He remembered the extra pre the jocks wiped on his chest! He scratched furiously. &quot;Chest hair? Fuck you guys! This is too much!&quot;, Alex yelled in his very boyish voice.<br />
<br />
Simon glared at Alex; &quot;you guys never learn, do you?&quot;. Simon reached into his jockstrap, soaked with pre and got some on his hands. He roughly yanked one of Alex&#39;s arms back, exposing his large brown bush. Simon wiped the pre all over the bush, making sure to rub it in well. Simon did the same with the other pit. Alex moaned in his high voice as his pits started to itch, sprouting even more hair. He soon had as much as simon and the smell was just awful! Why had he opened his mouth, he thought, looking at the sloppy bush that stuck out even with his twiggy arms at his sides. It looked out of place on his body, as did his new bulging appendage.<br />
<br />
Cameron&#39;s growth seemed to be slowing down. He was about 6 foot 4 and 250 pounds, with a significant amount of that wight being muscle. Simon smiled, knowing he would make a perfect linebacker, after a bit more work; after all Cameron was practically hairless! Cameron&#39;s clothes had long burst apart, Cameron. Had a sizeable bulge in his boxers, but nothing compared to Alex.<br />
<br />
Cameron had a deep voice and a large muscular linebacker body, but not much else. Alex had hairy stinky pits and very impressive genitals, but that was it. Neither had any facial hair whatsoever. Simon, Mark, and Devon dispersed to their lockers to find more items to use. It was clear they had some more work to do.<br />
<br />
With Alex and Cameron alone, Alex asked &quot;Are you okay? Damn man, you are huge! Let&#39;s get out of here before they do anything else to us!&quot;. Cameron looked at Alex but all he could think about were those thick brown bushes that had sprouted out of his friend&#39;s armpit. He wanted to escape and he knew it was really gross, but all he could think about was sticking his face and sniffing his friends body odor. He began to get hard. He was disgusted. He hated that Simon&#39;s magic was so strong, but he couldn&#39;t help it. He began to advance towards Alex, never taking his eyes off his armpits. &quot;Cam, what are you doing?!&quot;, Alex stammered.</p>
