<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ian ran past Derek, he could feel is penis pressing hard against his pants. Once in his room, he locked the door and nearly ripped his pants off trying to get some relief. As he unbutton and unzipped his pants, letting them drop to the floor, his penis push over the top of his briefs, sliding them down. He couldn’t believe the boner he had and had to take a look…<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Ian says in a low voice as he looks at his cock. He knew from seeing his father and brother naked that he too would have good length to him, but not like this. He was usually about five inches when he was hard. At least he was the last time he was with his so-called boyfriend that left him just before they moved. Now he looked to be closer to eight inches. And his girth was growing too. He was used to being long and thin. Now his penis was longer and thick.<br />
<br />
Then something broke him out of his trance. He heard squeaking floors coming from the direction of his parents’ new room. “Well, looks like I maybe having another sibling soon enough.” He whispers as he also starts hearing his brother starting to beat it again as well. <br />
Ian went to sit down on his new bed once he notice something else. As he sat, he pressed his balls into his legs.  “Shit, they grew too!” he says. He takes his hand and starts tracing his still harden cock. “Oh” he moans as he touches himself. He was never that sensitive. If anything, he was used to himself not getting hard just so it wouldn’t show while he was swimming. <br />
<br />
But none of that mattered now, as he grabs his penis with his hand and starts rubbing up and down. His mind was empty except for the feeling he was receiving from himself. It was like the time when his ex-boyfriend first gave him a hand job, but so much better. Pre starts to leak on his hand as he continues to stroke himself. Using his other hand, he takes off the rest of his clothes, stopping his own hand job just long enough to take his shirt off. <br />
<br />
As he resumes working on himself, he slides to the floor with his enlarged member pointing right at his door. He hears his parents and his brother all moan in climax just before he does too. Streams of his seed shoots over the back of his door and on the floor. <br />
Catching his breath, Ian stands up and walks to his bathroom to grab a towel to clean up. He sees himself in the mirror. His muscles did appear larger. “I got to be careful, or I will bloat up like the others. I need to keep my swim times.” <br />
<br />
As Ian cleans himself off and his room, his penis finally calms down. His penis is now hanging lose between his legs, longer then what he was before when he was hard. His balls were notably large when he walked. Ian just shook it off, his mind still a little bit fuzzy from dinner and all the food he ate. He soon turned off his light and laid down on his bed still nude, covering up and drifting off to bed. <br />
In the morning, Ian awoke to the worse morning wood he ever had. Looking down his sheets, he could see the outline of his penis piercing though the sheets. He gets up and tosses the sheets off of him to see his cock throbbing hard. His vines pulsated in the low light of the morning. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I got too…” Ian gets out of bed and runs to the bathroom and turns on the shower. As the water turns on, he is just barely to point his rod to the shower before he erupts all over the shower walls. Breathing heavily, he leans over, placing his hands just above his knees to hold himself up. His heavy breaths covered by the sound of the shower. “That was too close. What is happening to me?” Ian couldn’t believe that he came twice so soon after each other. Let alone being this hard with just morning wood. He never used to get morning wood. <br />
Ian, after catching his breath, hops in the shower before getting back out and dressed for the morning. He decided that he wanted to explore, even against his parents’ wishes and decided to put on a sleeveless shirt, shorts and good walking shoes. Putting on his shorts was a pain, with his new penis slowly trying to peek out of his short leg and his balls being pressed up tight. <br />
<br />
Walking downstairs, he runs into Derek as he is running out of his room. Derek gives Ian a little nudge as he runs by. “Hey squirt, me and dad have to go meet up with Jose. His truck dies just outside of town. The house is just yours and mom’s until we get back.” <br />
Ian shakes his head before walking into the kitchen. His mom was in their humming away to some random song before she sees her youngest son. “Hey dear.” She says. “Your brother and dad had to run out real quick.” <br />
<br />
“I heard. Derek said Jose’s truck died.” Ian replies. <br />
<br />
“Yes. But I have breakfast for you.” Natasha tells him, placing a bowl of oats and raisins down. “Eat up. What are you going to do today while we wait for your brother and father to get back?” <br />
<br />
Ian sits down to this most unusual breakfast for him. “I still wanted to look around.” <br />
<br />
“Do be going into town until me and your father have a chance to check it out.” Natasha warns her son. <br />
<br />
“We have what? Seven hundred acers now, I think I will be fine just checking it out.” Ian replies. His mother nods before returning to clean up the bowls left from his brother and father. After he finished his breakfast, Ian walks out the door in into a warm ray of sunshine. <br />
<br />
Walking out for a while, Ian comes across an old barn just outside the view of the house. He sees that the barn door was open and decided to check it out. As he came closer, he hears noises from inside the barn, like an animal was kicking around or something. Walking closer, Ian jumps as he see…</p>
