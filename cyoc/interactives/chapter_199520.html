<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dani and Vivi were hard at work in  the backroom trying to turn buttons into thimbles. Vivi&#39;s were actually quite good for a beginner, resembling thimbles made from the same plastic as the buttons. Dani&#39;s buttons, however, stubbornly refused to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Dani, &quot;yours are actually doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had a bit of a head start,&quot; said Vivi. She held Dani&#39;s hand. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll catch up in no time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani tried once again. She sprinkled some powdered newt&#39;s eye over the button and whispered a spell in Sumerian, being extra careful to pronounce the ancient words perfectly. The result was slightly better: the button turned into metal like a thimble should be, but it retained its button shape.<br />
<br />
Morgana stepped back in. &quot;Sorry I had to leave. A client wanted to be turned into a werevixen. Why, Daniela! I do believe you&#39;re improving! Turning plastic into metal is far from the easiest thing in the world. You&#39;re a natural witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani&#39;s eyes brightened. &quot;Thanks, Morgana!&quot; A wistful look then came over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Morgana asked, her voice concerned.<br />
<br />
Dani shrugged. &quot;You wanna know something, Morgana? When we first met, I was kinda hoping you&#39;d make me your familiar and turn me into a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vivi&#39;s eyes went big as saucers. &quot;But why, Dani?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;ve wanted to be a cat since I was little,&quot; said Dani. &quot;I thought it was an impossible kid dream. Then I heard about all this witch stuff and thought I had a real chance. Being a witch is cool and all, but...&quot; She trailed off yearningly.<br />
<br />
Morgana smiled. &quot;You needn&#39;t fret about that. All fully qualified witches can turn themselves into cats, dogs, frogs, mice, birds, and even wolves. I once knew a Norwegian witch who could turn into a whale, of all things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you teach me?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
Morgana laughed. &quot;Can I? I have to if I want you to be a proper witch! I just need to find the ingredients for the salve...&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgana began sifting through the shelves, crates, tables, and just plain junk piles of the backroom. It was somehow more cluttered than the public shop! The witch began grabbing ingredient after ingredient before heading over to a work table to throw them together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot; Morgana muttered as she mixed everything together as Dani and Vivi watched intently. &quot;Wild celery juice... wolfsbane... cinquefoil... wheat flour... belladonna... black henbane... mandrake... hemlock... jimson weed... and, of course, a dollop of cat fat.&quot; Morgana mixed the ingredients together in a silver bowl with a spoon made from hawthorn wood. &quot;You salve is ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani scratched the back of her caramel-colored neck nervously and whispered to Vivi. &quot;She does know that most of those ingredients are muy, muy poisonous, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vivi giggled. &quot;To mortals, sure. Remember, we&#39;re witches. The biological rules are different for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Vivi whispered. &quot;Magicals are work different from mortals one way or another. Did you know werebeasts don&#39;t get sick? Not from human diseases, anyway. They&#39;ve also got a mild healing factor, but vampires get a more extreme one. As for us witches, we&#39;re basically immune to poison, and we live for five to seven hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding?&quot; said Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Vivi. &quot;Mom was born in 1707. Her own mom escaped from Salem as a teenager. We probably won&#39;t get our first wrinkles until around 2290.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Muy sweet arrangement,&quot; whispered Dani.<br />
<br />
Morgana sighed. &quot;Are you two done chatting?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two apprentices nodded awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Morgana nodded sternly. &quot;Good. Now, to apply the salve, I&#39;ll have to ask you to get undressed, Daniela. You will then apply the salve to your armpits and your vulva.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To my... what?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t make the rules,&quot; said Morgana. &quot;That&#39;s just how it works. Anyway, you rub it into... certain hairy places... until it&#39;s fully absorbed and then speak the magic spell: &#39;Let my teeth become fangs, let my hands become paws, let my nails become claws, let my ears grow pointed, let my body be furry, let me turn into a cat!&#39; And then you simply mentally will the changes to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani nodded and stripped nude. She took a scoop of the salve and began rubbing the cream into her left armpit. It felt jellylike and cool to the touch and smelled like an odd combination of lard and herbs. Dani had quit shaving when she&#39;d become a Wiccan, so there was quite a bit of hair under her arms. She felt the cream saturate her armpit hair and mat it. Once the salve was fully absorbed, Dani applied the strange ointment to her right armpit. That done, she took another scoop and held it to her pussy.<br />
<br />
Dani began by smearing the cream into her dark pubes. It was almost like rubbing the weirdest shampoo ever into them. Feeling the fatty salve greasing her bush was getting Dani unexpectedly horny. The feeling was so damn sensual! She slid the magical gloop lower down, towards her moistening pussy lips. Dani rubbed at her genitals, trying to get as much of the ointment in as possible. Wow, the unction felt good on her meaty lips! It was like a special lube! As Dani rubbed, the Mexican girl&#39;s fingers brushed over her her exposed clit. She shuddered as her arousal spiked. She began pounding more and more intensely at her pussy, her lust reaching a fever pitch. She was suddenly hit by a potent orgasm. Her vagina began to clench and her pussy sprayed feminine juices across the floor. Wracked with ecstasy, Dani collapsed onto her caramel-colored butt.<br />
<br />
As the pleasure haze faded, Dani was overcome by embarrassment. &quot;Oh, Dios mío! I&#39;m so fucking sorry, Morgana! I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgana smiled. &quot;Forget about it. It happens to all of us sometimes, especially on the first time. It IS a very erotic experience. Now you should probably finish your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said Dani as she stood back up. &quot;Let my teeth become fangs, let my hands become paws, let my nails become claws, let my ears grow pointed, let my body be furry, let me turn into a cat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani focused with all her might on herself as a beautiful cat. For a moment, she seemed to feel something happening. Her teeth were sharpening! Dani held up a hand and gleefully watched her fingernails sharpening into cat claws. Then she felt her ears and nose begin to morph! And then... the spell unexpectedly stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?!&quot; gasped Dani. &quot;Why&#39;d it stop?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this WAS only your first attempt,&quot; said Morgana. &quot;You honestly did better than I did when I fist tried the transformation salve. I just got some little claws, and that was that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vivi placed a comforting hand on Dani&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ll get better at it, honey. I know you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you will,&quot; said Morgana. &quot;Now, about turning back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said anything about turning back?&quot; Dani grinned. &quot;As long as I can&#39;t be a full cat, I wanna look like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaaaay...&quot; said a very confused Morgana. &quot;I&#39;ll have to see if I can put a geis on your parents to make them accept that. I should warn you, though, some people are born resistant or immune to geises. Kimberly Vordenburg Hamilton and Suzanne York Bentley, to name two highly frustrating examples.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That still wouldn&#39;t let her walk around in public,&quot; said Vivi. &quot;I a glamer could be our best bet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means an illusion,&quot; said Morgana. &quot;We&#39;d cast a spell that lets you keep you feline features, but only magicals would be able to see them. To the mundane folk, you&#39;d just look like a normal human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great,&quot; Dani smiled as she admired her new claws. &quot;Maybe later I can go back and add things to this form like fur or a tail. This such a freaking dream come true!&quot;</p>
