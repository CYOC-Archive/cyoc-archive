<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan for some reason was feeling really good. He felt happy and had a sense of pride for some reason. It seemed that others could notice it too, as he had recieved a few more passing glances than he was use to as he walked down the sidewalk, and almost all of them were from men too, which he felt was a bit odd, but didn&#39;t care enough about it to let it ruin his good mood. About halfway to the gamestore, a cute looking girl with white blonde hair suddenly called out to him. She was very pretty, and likely around his age too. Her hair was tied into a short, shoulder length, curly ponytail, which he definitely felt fit her looks perfectly. When he saw her face, he was immediately drawn to her redish eye color, and couldnt help but stare for a few extra seconds at them. <br />
<br />
Guessing what it was about, the girl clarified for him. &quot;Hey there. I&#39;m sure you are wondering, so, yes, I am actually albino. But I wanted to ask you just where did you find those boots? They look awesome on you. Actually, want to get some lunch with me, I have a few more questions for you if you do not mind. Oh and my name is Shane, and before you ask, my parents thought I was going to be a boy, so when I came out, they just decided to use the name anyways.&quot; The girl was now waiting excitedly for Ryan&#39;s response. &quot;Uh, sure, why not. I&#39;m Ryan by the way.&quot; What could he say, she was his type. This seemed to somehow make the girl even more happy, if that was sonehow even possible. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way! You are like, the only other girl I have ever met with what normally is considered more of a male first name!&quot; Exclaimed Shane as she began pulling his hand to get him to follow her. &quot;Come with me Ryan. I know just the place.&quot; Ryan was now slightly confused. What did Shane mean by &quot;another girl&quot;? Come to think of it, didn&#39;t she also ask him about where he bought his boots from? While doing his best to not stumble as Shane was pulling him along with her, he glanced downwards. Sure enough, he had the same body as always. While he was by no means super muscular or extremely masculine, and always kept a cleanly shaven face, he didn&#39;t think he could easily be mistaken for a girl either. The bigger concern was when he noticed that his legs were still shiny and black. And now that he thought of it, there had been a clicking sound whenever he took a step since he left the dressing room of the shoe store, but he had just ignored it. Oh no, he was still wearing the boots, and furthermore, he had returned his actual shoes to the store! <br />
<br />
Panic swept over Ryan as he realized why he was receiving so many glances. He likely looked like such an idiot wearing these. This also meant that this girl likely was just messing with him too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Shane, hold on for a second. I actually remembered that I have to do something at a store before its too late, so I can&#39;t go to lunch with you. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He apologized, hoping she would just let him leave without causing much of a scene. But contrary to his expectations, she didn&#39;t seem bothered all that much and simply nodded. &quot;No problem, do you mind me comming with you though, I really would like to get to know you more!&quot; <br />
<br />
Huh? This girl... she wanted to go with him? Was she really not making fun of him? After giving it another moment of thought, Ryan replied. &quot;Uh, sure I guess. Plus it is where I bought these boots too, so we can kill 2 birds with 1 stone.&quot; Again, Shane smiled brilliantly, and actually this time just held your hand and didn&#39;t pull you, but instead began her next set of questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, I have to ask, just how long is your hair? It must have taken ages to get like that.&quot; She began.<br />
<br />
Ryan thought about it for a second, wondering if he should lie and pretend like he was answering for the female him that she saw, or answer her honestly. He decided to answer her honestly, as he didn&#39;t know what she saw him look like. &quot;Hmm, well if I had to guess, maybe 3 or 4-.&quot; Before he could finish, Shane spoke out in shock, interupting him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, 4 feet! That&#39;s crazy. I kind of wish I could have hair that long. But my job works better with medium to short hair best, so I really can&#39;t grow it out long like you. Damn it, I am like, so damn jealous. Please, you have to let me style it for you sometime. Ok, next question, well, more like statement really. And please feel free to stop me if it bothers you or you don&#39;t want to continue in the topic, ok. Anyways, I am kind of glad to see that there exists another girl who shares my pains. As a fellow E cup myself, I know exactly how hard they can be on the back and shoulders. However, I am amazed at how well you can maintain your posture. You make it look like they don&#39;t even weight an ounce. So you have to tell me. What&#39;s your secret? Do you just ignore the soreness, or do you like, have a special workout or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Ryan had no idea how to answer her question. So he casually said that he wasn&#39;t comfortable yet talking to her about it, which she understood and apologized for asking. Now it was Ryan who had a question for her. &quot;Say, why did you call out to me in the first place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane blushed a bit at the question and answered it honestly. &quot;I just suddenly wanted to talk with and get to know you better. You looked like such an amazing person, with how you carry yourself with such confidence especially. I felt that you and I would easily become friends if we spent some time together.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, is that right? Well, thanks&quot; replied Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually there is another reason too.&quot; Stated Shane. &quot;I wanted to ask you out, as like, on a date and such. I find you to be very attractive and didn&#39;t want to miss my chance. So, there is also that too&quot; she admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, this girl really seems serious about it too. But she seems to believe that I am some woman with a crazy hot body or something. I guess I better clarify it with her before she gets the wrong idea&quot; thought Ryan to himself. It was the first time he had ever been depressed not to have been born a girl in his life. <br />
<br />
Ryan pulled Shane off to the side in order to have a bit more privacy. &quot;Look, I really appreciate that you find me attractive and believe me, I would love to date you if I could, but I am not sure if I can. I don&#39;t know what you see in me, but as far as I know, I... here one sec.&quot; Ryan pulled out his wallet in order to show her his license photo, as it would be a much better show of proof. &quot;See here. This is my.... what the fuck?&quot; When Ryan pulled out his license, everything at first glance looked the same, but when he focused on it, it clearly was a completely different person in the image than himself. Plus the sex even stated him as being female. The only thing that was the same was their names. The image showed a gorgeous woman with long, dark brown hair, emerald colored eyes and fair skin. She indeed had fairly large breasts, which truly were about the same size as Shane&#39;s. &quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot; Asked Ryan to no one in particular. While at the same time, he was immersed in total confusion, and began to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, are you ok Ryan?&quot; asked Shane, now concerned as to what is going on. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? And you don&#39;t look so good either. Alright, come on, my place is close by, so you can lay down there for a bit until you manage to calm down&quot; decided Shane as she helped Ryan move along with her. As they passed by a store, Ryan caught out of the corner of his eye a brief look at their reflection in the glass. What he saw was not Shane and himself, but Shane walking along with the same woman from his ID. Now that he could see a full length image of her, he realized she was dressed nearly identical as himself too, save for the fact that all of it was now the female equivalent, such as with the shorts on himself, being tight short shorts on her. Or how his normal black t-shirt became a V-neck crop top. The hoodie stayed the same, just was now in a woman&#39;s size. Finally, there they were. The shiny, black, thigh high, open toed, high heeled boots. Unlike on him, they looked perfect on her longer legs. &quot;This can&#39;t be real, right?&quot; questioned Ryan to himself as he continued to stare at their reflection while Shane guided him to her apartment.</p>
