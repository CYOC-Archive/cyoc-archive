<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This was based on something I wrote on a different site. Technically the story was started by someone else, but this is based on the branch of wrote of it. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John got out of his bed. He was 18 and was going to a community college till he figure out what he wanted to do for a major. That said today he had no classes which let him sleep in to lunch time where he&#39;d make his lunch. However going down to the kitchen his mother and 16 year old sister Kim were in the living room by the piano. John was plugging his ears as he was walking past his home schooled sister. Ever since she was 5 his mother decided to home school her and start her with the old family piano. Ever since she was 5 the girl was terrible at it, but their mother kept making her play. Practice makes perfect but John supposed if you had negative talent you could only get less bad. Even plugging out a decent amount of noise he could tell about 30% of the notes she was playing were bad notes, and at that point the notes she was making sounded flat. Then she thank godly ended and said &quot;Well... I got about 70% of them right right? That&#39;s a passing grade right?&quot; Their mother was sipping something out of a wine glass and it was empty.<br />
The older woman said &quot;We&#39;ll do some more... Just let me refill my glass.&quot; John walked with his mom to the kitchen and he let his mother refill her glass with chardonnay. The middle-aged woman had once managed to earn a music competition which was shown off on top of the Piano, and at some point it became obvious to John that his mother had tried to live through his sister. His sister however wasn&#39;t any good, and while John had tried the piano once and wasn&#39;t half bad he was his father&#39;s golden boy and wasn&#39;t actually interested in playing much. Dad wasn&#39;t around very much, but when he was around and had the energy they&#39;d go out to a game or play catch or something. <br />
John started boiling some water and thought to himself &quot;Wish Kim was great at the piano. Then she probably wouldn&#39;t beat herself up so much, and maybe mom wouldn&#39;t drink as much.&quot; <br />
By the time his water was boiling and John was putting in his ramen packet the piano started up again... and it was pretty good. She was playing the right notes, there seemed to be life in the music, and it was fucking Ode to Joy. It&#39;d be a few minutes till the ramen was ready so he went to the piano, and noticed a few things. The sheet music read &quot;Nocturn op. 9&quot;, his mother was still drinking and examining her daughter more vigorously, there were a lot more trophies on top of the piano, and Kim was looking surprised. John got his ramen mid-way during the performance, but it was pretty amazing and hard to pull himself away from. John at his ramen as Nocturn ended and then finished it up fast. Then as he did his dishes he heard his mother and sister raise their voices, and then someone stomped their way upstairs. John finished with his dishes walked back into the living room and saw his sister.<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; John asked.<br />
Kim said &quot;I just got godlike at piano, and all those trophies, and mom...&quot;<br />
John said &quot;Not gonna lie sis. A bit before you got godlike I kinda wished you were great at the piano... Maybe that did something?&quot;<br />
Kim looked at her hand and said &quot;Well... thanks I guess? If your wish did anything maybe it could do something again?&quot; John took out his phone which was cracked and several generations out of date, and made a simple wish and voila it was the latest gen without a single imperfection. <br />
&quot;What are you looking at your phone for?&quot; Kim asked seemingly not noticing the upgrade right in front of her face. John strained himself a little bit until Kim seemed to realize what happened and said &quot;Wow... Ooo could you do mine next?&quot; <br />
John thought for a moment and said &quot;Know what, I&#39;m going to go experiment with this power a little. Go ahead and write down a list of things you want and I&#39;ll do what I can Kim.&quot; <br />
Kim nodded meanwhile John thought about what exactly he would want to try to do.</p>
