<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were just swinging for Harold. Parents were off-world at Epsilon Pheta for the weekend, wherever that is. Clad in his dark leather trenchcoat, the rebellious raven haired youth from one of the finer living quarters in the Union City sprawl was looking to raise some serious Hell feeling the literal planet all to himself. He first had the decency to finish up his remedial courses for the day and off he was to the metro on his way home to get hyped and ready. Storming out the gare and through the street where spoiled onlookers feel him as an eyesore, he makes his way into his high class high rise and goes up to his family's floor. He enters into a wolf's maw of darkness which he's used to after routinely getting home from classes and parents still busy, so he prompts the lights on vocally: &quot;Lights...&quot; - and there was light. To his surprise however, it was a lone spotlight shining above him. This obviously disorients him, he's then totally confused getting greeted smack dab right in front of him what looks like a frame. It looked pearlescent, decorative and fancy with clowns crafted in position as they were happily holding the frame, complacent pierrots making the introduction to the image, and the face of a sensual female jester etched on top overlooking straight at him. The spotlight then disappeared and Harold was alone with this frame glowing in the dark. Just when he was about to knock it over in a fit of frustration a light fazed, the picture of his clown finally appeared, and out of nowhere a xylophone kiddie motif could be heard. Harold stood muttering in annoyance looking at that clown just smiling at him in his yellow ruffle collar and black pointy hat with yellow puffballs lined up sitting in his bleachy chrome dome. His entire face was buried in the makeup with a big red smile framed by his jaw, long arches rounding his eyes up to his forehead, and a bubbly red nose for the finish. Harold then has a good mind to just the dismiss the entire pathetic display and just walk out of the apartment, regardless of how bizarre the entire thing seemed, until he's grabbed by the arms forcibly. <br />
&quot;And just where do you think you're going, Mr. Bozo??&quot; - he finds himself in a shock being grabbed by a Pierrot on one arm and a clown on the other.<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; - anyone would normally ask, as did Harold completely freaked out and seemingly being dragged inside the frame. The clowns then drop him and jump into an act of gasping frenzy.<br />
&quot;Language, you little clown!&quot; - the Pierrot, apparently female, pouted and pointed at him with authority.<br />
&quot;Little clown?! Wh-what are you talking about!?&quot; - he struggles asking back on his feet. He then feels a certain rumble beneath but he stands still, perfectly still to his paralyzed horror on a circus platform.<br />
&quot;I'm talking about you watching that mouth young man or else your father here and I are gonna have to jam some soap down your throat!&quot; - the Pierrot then claims breaking the act, revealing it's his mother wearing that baggy white and blue clown jumpsuit with a thick blue neck collar. His father on the other hand was actually a blueface clown with a receding orange afro hairline in a tighter yellow suit with blue polka dots.<br />
&quot;Hello, son! I'm a clown!&quot; - he gleefully finally talks.<br />
&quot;What the Hell is going on here?!&quot; <br />
&quot;Well Harry baby in reality I have something of a business trip at Epsilon Pheta and they're really gonna need me there for a while.&quot; - his mom calmly begins to explain. &quot;Now that planet is heavily fundamentalist so I have to adjust a little bit to their culture, so for the next couple of weeks we're all 3 going to be clowns off-world.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?! No! You guys go! I'll stay!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not happening clownboy...&quot; - his mom says approaching him paralyzed. &quot;Cheese would you give us a moment?&quot; - she turns at his dad for a quick second. &quot;Tent.&quot; - she prompts, and a small yellow circus tent materializes itself above them with some equipment. &quot;Now baby you know that I know better than to leave you all alone while your daddy and I are out of the planet! We also have family there! I promised your auntie Prudence and we're also gearing up for a big family reunion...&quot; - she says opening dressers and reaching out for a black jumpsuit with yellow polka dots and thick ruffle collar, Harold's skin shivers realizing he had earlier looked at what he's about to be turned into. &quot;What do you think? You're going to look just adorable, you're going to be my cute little clown! And look!...&quot; - she pulls out the big floppy yellow shows. &quot;Tailor made just for you!&quot;<br />
&quot;M-mom, please no! Don't do this! You know you don't have to do this! You know you don't have to waste any money on me having to drag me along on this trip!&quot; - Harold begs as his mom rummages and settles the equipment ready.<br />
&quot;Nonsense you little clown! You know that this exactly is what I'd love! Now relax, I'm gonna strip you off those meanie clothes...&quot; - she hops into the platform and effortlessly strips him down nude. &quot;Let me show you something cool, I got a haircut!&quot; - she steps in front of him and takes off her blue cap to reveal her head smoothly bald. &quot;What do you think? That crazy little punk with the mohawk you brought once got nothing on me! And you too are doing the smoothie, chrome dome!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha-no! No! Don't do it!&quot; - he whimpers but his clown mother already had the electric razor on him.<br />
&quot;Relax, that platform there has you totally good and numb...&quot; - she reassures him, completely concentrated in her work of cutting off every last spot of black down. &quot;There! All done! Now let me bleach up, real easy, we don't even have to shave this...&quot; - she reaches out for what looks like lipstick and coats her already red lips to a new strange glittery red shine. &quot;This technology's just amazing!&quot; - she says and blows a kiss at him. Then up into the air puckering and blowing kisses smiling once again into the clown character and blinks rapidly at Harold before pecking him with a kiss on the top of his fresh hair trim causing his skin to shine and bleach as if a spell had been cast on him. He was completely pale and smooth, with the exception of his crotch area, which his mother saw fit to cover up with a big gag diaper. &quot;Don't worry, me and your dad are wearing one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
As his body slowly regained movement, Harold had obliged to finish up dressing himself as a clown. After his makeup and nose were in place, his mother handed him a pair of fine white stage gloves for his hands. They snuggle in place and she leads him to a mirror where they both stood transformed. He felt defeated but she wouldn't stop giggling innocently. &quot;Oh ho ho, what fun we're all going to have!&quot;</p>
