<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours later; Benton’s butler opened the door to Lance and Lila have arrived. Being the proper English butler he was; George asked to take their coats, despite the fact that neither was wearing one. Escorting them inside with his usual stiffness; Lance couldn’t help but roll his eyes as Jeffery, Benton’s past butler was a far sight more pleasant and genial than the were-tiger currently in Benton’s employ.<br />
<br />
It was when Lance saw his older brother that the were-panther sighed; finally able to be free of George and his icy demeanor only made colder compared to Amanda’s towards his wife Lila.<br />
“You look like shit,” Lance staring at his brother; “what did you do, sleep with your fur standing up on end?”<br />
“Something like that,” Benton looking ragged; despite the nap he had after seeing his therapist. “But if you need to know,” Benton sighing; “I’ve been running on lack of sleep, stressed out with work and other issues.”<br />
“I know,” Lance looking at his brother in all his furry glory; “despite loathing the position you put me in, being the were-panther rep of the council does have its advantages.”<br />
“Just remember,” Benton chuckling; “you only got six more years before Frieda takes over. Married life is treating you well,” Benton looking at his younger brother; “married just under nine months and you are already expecting your first cub?”<br />
“Yeah,” Lance staring at his wife as she distracts Ethel while sneaking a bit to eat; “I was surprised a few months ago when she walked to me in all her were-tigress glory, her tail swishing and holding onto a small white object saying to me ‘get used to being called daddy soon, because in nine months you’ll be one’. God I was shocked,” Lance smiling wistfully; “now with her baby bump just starting to show…”<br />
“I know the feeling,” Benton smiling; “when Amanda was pregnant with Frieda, I couldn’t stop bouncing up off the walls excited with the prospect of being a father. Get use to the three am feedings and changing dirty diapers,&quot; Benton looking sad; “Cherish those moments Lance, don’t squander those early years with your child like I did with Frieda.”<br />
<br />
Moments later Frieda comes running into the kitchen hugging her uncle as he smiles seeing her. Getting a strong whiff of sex off of her; Lance knew Eric and Spencer were here and that they were having a little fun.<br />
“Well,” Lance seeing his were-panthress niece and giving her a loving hug; “how are you today Frieda? Not that I need to know,” Lance chuckling.<br />
“Uncle,” Frieda smiling; “you don’t need to try and dance around the subject like mom and dad.”<br />
“We don’t dance around the subject,” Benton answering; “your mother and I just feel discussing about rutting is not polite conversation.”<br />
“Prudes,” Frieda sticking out her tongue; “any sodas in the fridge? We are getting thirsty,” Frieda grinning; “what with our fun upstairs.”<br />
“Go,” Benton shuddering at the thought of his daughter’s sexual innuendo; “and don’t be long, I want you three cleaned up and showered before dinner.”<br />
<br />
“Not that it will make a difference,” Lance watching Frieda run and leap back upstairs; “Frieda will still have the smell of Eric and Spencer lingering on her after a shower.”<br />
“It never goes away,” Benton sighs; “even Amanda finds it distracting when hugging Frieda.”<br />
“I wonder,” Lance being thoughtful; “you don’t suppose… naw it would drive you crazy and you have enough stress that you don’t want this on the back of your mind.”<br />
“What,” Benton looking at his brother; “tell me!”<br />
“That Frieda, Eric and Spencer,” Lance hearing the wild rutting going on upstairs; “had a were-wedding and don’t even realize it.”<br />
<br />
Benton gasps as he puts the pieces together; the lingering smells, the way Frieda reacts around her friends, and way she refers Eric and Spencer as mates. Quickly escorting Lance to his study; Closing and locking the door; Benton turns to his brother.<br />
“You need to keep this between us,” Benton looking serious; “if Amanda caught wind.”<br />
“She’d have a fit and fly off the handle,” Lance nodding; “but the signs, Benton they can’t be ignored.”<br />
“Which is why I’ll talk to my daughter and the other two about this,” Benton looking at his brother; “then I’ll worry about letting Amanda know.”<br />
“Well,” Lance taking a thumb drive out of his pocket; “while we are here, I wonder if I can pick your brain about something? And show you what I dug up.”<br />
<br />
Benton looks at his brother in an odd way before accepting the thumb drive and placing it in his work computer.<br />
“I’m sure by now you have heard of Samantha Twist’s press conference;&quot; Lance watching his brother looking at past articles regarding his and Amanda’s society events.<br />
“What press conference,” Benton looking confused; “and what am I looking at?”<br />
“Samantha has announced her plan to run for mayor,” Lance speaking; “and I know who her opponent is and when they intend to announce their candidacy.”<br />
“Who,” Benton staring at the picture of Jack Ashford.<br />
“Kenya Adaeze-Crawford,” Lance stressing the last name.<br />
<br />
Upon hearing the name Crawford, Benton’s head snaps up growling as he stares at his brother.<br />
“And what does that have to do with the photos you have on this thumb drive,” Benton looking angry.<br />
“Kendra Smythe,” Lance calmly answering; “is an alias of Kenya Adaeze. Jack Ashford,” Lance letting his were-panther out just in case Benton explodes in rage; “is an alias that Jack Crawford has been using for the past few years.”<br />
“THAT EXPLAINS THINGS,” Benton roaring; “the construction delays, all the excuses the contractors have been giving me,” Benton seething; “they all came from and email with the name Jack Ashford on it! How dare that scheming worm,” Benton pounding his desk; “manipulate me and delay the completion of the new elementary school! What else do you know Lance!”<br />
“Arnold Steward Stevenson,” Lance look at his brother frothing at the mouth; “is Kenya’s campaign manager. Look Benton,” Lance sighing; “I can’t technically be actively involved in this, what with managing a newspaper that has to remain impartial. And I’m well aware that you have… issues,” Lance stressing; “with Frances and Samantha’s relationship, but standing behind Samantha’s bid for mayor, it just might put the proverbial monkey wrench in Jack Crawford’s plans.”<br />
<br />
Benton was growling, Snarling as he tried his best not to attack his brother. Benton knew he was only giving him some news; news he did not like hearing, but it did help put into context some of the strain he has been under lately. Seeing the pictures of Jack and Kenya at several of his social functions using aliases, thumbing their noses at him. While it was true; Benton loathed that Frances and Samantha were a lesbian couple with a large standing in Moon Lake’s society. Trying to crush them for their sexual preference in the past; it was through his talks with his therapist doctor Frances Twist and his daughter’s bisexual tendencies that have softened his stance towards such non traditional relationships of late.<br />
<br />
“I take it you already talked to Samantha Twist,” Benton doing his best to remain calm.<br />
“Yes,” but before Lance could finish his phone rings; seeing its his reporter Ella Alyn, Lance answers the call and puts her on speaker.<br />
“Ella,” Lance speaking; “I have you on speaker so my brother can hear what you have to say. I take it you have some more information regarding the email I sent you?”<br />
“Oh do I ever,” Ella speaking; “I struck reporting gold as it were.”<br />
“Well share it,” Lance speaking; “give us something to work with.”<br />
“I contacted a few of my friends in some of the Seattle papers,” Ella speaking; “they have photos of Kendra Smythe in the arms of other gentlemen. All weres like Jack Ashford but not in their fursonas; but you know how a were can tell if a person is a normal or not just with a photo. I did a little digging into the name,” Ella speaking; “Kendra Smythe was an escort agent that worked for a number of high priced agencies that specialized in were-clients. Jack Crawford’s wife,” Ella pausing; “was a hooker in a ways.”<br />
“Thanks Ella,” Lance answering; “I want an expose on the gazette’s front page come Tuesday. So we don’t get sued for libel and what not, be sure to double check all your facts and sources. Oh and Ella,” lance looking at Benton and smiling; “I want to see you at Kenya and Jack’s press conference during the labor day picnic asking those hard questions, make them sweat bullets.”<br />
“Will do boss,” Ella answering; “I’ll keep you posted.”<br />
<br />
Lance ending the phone conversation; stares at Benton, watching his anger disappear and a menacingly evil grin spread across his maw.<br />
“I take it,” Lance looking at his brother; “you’re going to help Samantha’s campaign?”<br />
“If it will burry Jack Crawford,” Benton smiling; “I’ll fund Samantha’s campaign personally. Jack married a hooker,” Benton is starting to laugh; “that’s the best news I’ve heard all week!&quot;<br />
“It gets better,” Lance looking at his phone; “Samantha texted me that Nate Anderson, Eric’s older brother once dated Kenya. He broke it off with her, when he caught Kenya holding onto an engagement ring after visiting Jack as a client.”<br />
“Oh that’s gold brother,” Benton still laughing; “if I wasn’t on these dam bipolar meds, I’d be celebrating with a single malt scotch.”</p>
