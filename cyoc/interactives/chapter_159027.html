<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually, Trent regathered his senses and opened his eyes to see that he was now sitting at the round table where Kirsty was before. Trent took a deep breath only to notice that his chest has gotten heftier. <br />
<br />
Looking down at his new body, he gasped as he saw small breasts distending a low-cut blouse. The color of the blouse is a light blue, seemingly a mix between Kirsty&#39;s dark blue blouse and his own white shirt. The breasts do look a little smaller than Kirsty&#39;s, perhaps to compensate for Trent&#39;s lack of boobs. Hanging from his neck was the red tie from his usual outfit, which flowed down into the cleavage of his new chest.  Outside, he was now wearing a black stripped blazer with two buttons around his torso. While the blazer barely changed (Trent guessed it was because both him and Kirsty were wearing black clothing, but his business suit was stripped.), his torso got even slimmer, which was amazing given Trent&#39;s already slender figure. Leaning forward to look past the boobs, he saw that he has a larger ass to compensate, completing the hourglass figure that Kirsty once possessed. The ass and slender legs were now wrapped in dark sheer pantyhose, the color matching that of his previous dress pants. He was also now wearing a tight black stripped skirt of mid thigh length to complement his new suit. At his feet (which has gotten more petite due to Kirsty) were dark brown kitten heels, a mix between Kirsty&#39;s four inch stilettos and Trent&#39;s brown dress shoes. Trent moved his new sleek hands up and down his new body, enjoying the new sensations from this amalgamation. While Trent wasn&#39;t particularly interested in women, being one is a different experience altogether, and surprisingly, his new form adopted more of Kirsty&#39;s feminine attributes.<br />
<br />
Standing up from his chair, Trent could feel his new toned legs. Kirsty tends to work out quite often, and the fruits of labor were now visible in the form of sleek muscle features underneath the pantyhose. It helps to balance Trent on those kitten heels, which Trent no problems walking in. Overall, Trent felt more fit and lively, possibly due to Kirsty&#39;s healthier habits, which Trent was thankful for. Of course, the first feature he wanted to explore were those protrusions on his chest. He slowly moved his hands over them and gave a soft squeeze. Noticing how sensitive they were, Trent gave a small yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yelp. So this is how breasts feel like,&quot; Trent noted. It was also his first time hearing his new voice, which was a mix between Kirsty&#39;s high pitched tone and his own low register. The result was a mellow feminine voice that sounds... seductive, even for Trent. Perhaps this will fit Mr. Derby&#39;s tastes more. <br />
<br />
Trent decided to stop by the restroom first to check out the rest of his features in front of the mirror. Walking over to the door, Trent enjoyed the new physics in walking in a skirt attire. He noticed that he was walking in shorter strides than before to prevent the skirt from riding up too much, as the room air swirled around his mostly empty crotch. Unlike pants, the pantyhose certainly does not provide much warmth for the legs, leaving Trent with a cold feeling as he ambled across the room. But yet, a part of him felt that this was natural, much like walking in heels with presumably muscle memory. <br />
<br />
As Trent walked into the hallway, he breathed a sigh of relief that no one else was there. He wondered if his co-workers would recognize him. Would people refer to him as Trent or Kirsty, or another person altogether? What if he was a complete stranger to them?<br />
<br />
Deciding not to dwell on this, he quickly made his way across the hall to the restrooms. He briefly pondered entering the men&#39;s, but a part of him felt uncomfortable. But then he also felt uneasy entering the women&#39;s. After noticing someone opening a door further down the hallway, Trent quickly ducked into the women&#39;s restroom to avoid confrontation.<br />
<br />
Inside, he stepped in front of the sink and mirror. Noting his new facial features, his skin carried a more yellow cream colored tone between Kirsty&#39;s white and his tan skins. His hair was now a straight red blonde color just past shoulder length, shorter than Kirsty&#39;s original hair. His eyes were now hazel-colored, mixing between Kirsty&#39;s brown eyes and Trent&#39;s blue ones. Certainly a rare combination of color here. Overall, Trent noticed a mix of his and Kirsty&#39;s facial features, but they certainly lean more towards the feminine side. Trent thought, &quot;I guess when merging opposite genders, the result will randomly choose to favor one side. So I&#39;m technically female now?&quot; Looking down, he certainly didn&#39;t feel the bulge in his crotch when he squeezed his legs together, confirming that his dick is now gone. Despite that, he felt somewhat calm, as he realized that some of Kirsty&#39;s mannerisms mix with his own. Trent leaned toward the sink as he tried to subdue the mild headache from processing his thoughts. <br />
<br />
As the pain subsided, he pulled his left hand to notice the silver ring was still in his possession. This will at least allow him to reverse changes at any time, as Trent assured himself while pondering his next move.</p>
