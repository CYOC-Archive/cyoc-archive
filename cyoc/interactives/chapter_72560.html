<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat gently untangled Dan from the door, lifted his pot, and took him in the bathroom. There she put water in his pot, and brought him back to her room. The water soaked into Dan's roots, filling him with life and energy. But not energy that Dan would expect. Instead of wanting to move around and do things, all he seemed to want to do was sit there and find the sun. He extended his stalk towards the window as much as he could until Kat opened the window, and he felt sunlight stream in. He loved it, and he just basked in the glow of the feeling for what seemed like hours. He was a plant, there was no need for movement. Before he realized it Kat had been gone, and was doing other normal things, but Dan just sat there, content to soak in the sun's rays until the sun finally set. He sighed when it was dark, but there seemed the be not much else to do. He could barely move, and he didn't really feel like he wanted to even if he could. Se he just sat there. Kat came back into her room, and flipped the light as she went to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Kat watered Dan before she left to go into town. Dan was left at the house, alone, just to watch as the sun rose and fell from Kat's upstairs window. But somehow he felt content to stay that way. And it only seemed like an hour, and Kat was back, watering him again, and turning off the light to go to sleep. <br />
<br />
Dan's days went fairly quickly, his mind seeming to perceive time much differently. His mentality changed as well. He no longer felt bored. His thoughts drifted to what Kat had done, but he couldn't feel mad at her. In fact, he felt grateful to her for allowing him to live on her desk, and to have sunlight and water. He was only really aware of the world when someone came back into Kat's room. And then they would never talk to him. They treated him as the plant that he was. <br />
<br />
It was about a month later that Kat picked Dan's pot up. He had grown considerably, and if he was going to grow anymore, he needed to be planted in the ground. <br />
&quot;You ready to be planted outside?&quot; Kat asked. It took all of Dan's willpower to finally comprehend that she was talking to him, and then move at all in order to respond.<br />
&quot;Y-yes...&quot; was all he could muster, being the first words he'd spoken in a month. It felt foreign to him for him to be able to move, let alone talk. As she carried him, he tried to move more, and he succeeded in small movements, but it seemed so unnatural.  <br />
In the yard, Kat dug a hole in the ground, and finally began to take Dan out of his pot. His human mind knew what she was doing, but somehow his sluggish thoughts couldn't comprehend that this was good for him. He freaked out. <br />
&quot;N-no....stop...&quot; were the two words to come to mind. <br />
&quot;You'll be fine,&quot; Kat said. &quot;This'll be good for you.&quot; She gently placed his roots in the ground. For a moment, Dan felt like he was naked, his roots being exposed to the cold air. But she quickly put them in the ground, and burred them with nice, moist dirt. She watered him, and left him in the sun. This time he could watch as the sun went all the way up and all the way down as his vision was not blocked by anything. <br />
<br />
As the weeks went on, he felt himself grow. He no longer followed the sun, and only stared east, always waiting for the sun to come up. Days seemed to simply go by as he sat there. He never payed attention to his family. He hardly regarded them as family any more, the only one he knew being the nice girl who came and watered him every day. It had been almost six months, when spring time came, that the girl came and bushed his face with her hands. <br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; she said. &quot;You're moth and eyes are gone. That's strange.&quot; Dan had no idea what she was talking about. He had no eyes, he was a flower. His memory of a life before had faded, and he thought of himself as nothing else. He had lost all power of movement, if he wanted to that is. <br />
<br />
He stayed in the yard till a full year had passed. He had grown well over seven feet tall, but he could feel his time coming. He began to face the earth as his flower withered, and his seeds fell to the earth. His life was over, he felt.</p>
