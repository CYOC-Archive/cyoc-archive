<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joanna knew her mom used the same kind of password for everything.  It was her last name paired with a 4 digit number, usually her date of birth, the current year, or her &quot;favorite&quot; number.  That&#39;s only 3 possibilities, but perhaps her mother chose something else entirely.  It was an open secret that Joanna knew her mother&#39;s password tendencies.<br />
<br />
She briefly considered not trying to brute force the password, but what did she have to lose?  She was half-squatting on her hooved haunches, just low enough to let both her deflated udders rest on the floor.  She was much too large to use her computer chair.  She&#39;d even had to maneuver the keyboard away just so she could see it around her mountainous rack.  <br />
<br />
Her body was a mess, and she wasn&#39;t even sure what parts were naturally hers and which weren&#39;t.  If she got access, this entire nightmare could be over.  She clicked into the password field, and tried her mother&#39;s favorite number first.    Moments before pressing enter, Joanna internally questioned whether she typed it out correctly.  With her different body and altered keyboard location, she may have accidentally put in a wrong letter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s...&quot; She pressed the enter key, and was met with a red &#39;password failed.&#39;  Before she could so much as delete the password, a strange feeling pulsed within her gut, somewhere between her breasts and udder.  Placing her hands on the scant remaining space on her front, she recognized the familiar feeling of flesh pushing out.  &quot;Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna began to panic as she felt her latest edition fight for space between her breasts and udder.  She stood up, moving to her mirror to get a better look as she stripped off her shirt and bra.  It was a second row of tits, and they were already nearly as large as her original pair.  Thanks to her deflated udder, there was some space for the new rack to hang, but it was a snug fit to say the least.  This newest set still had human nipples, unlike the deformed teats that had been created through her use of the milk machine.<br />
<br />
The milk machine!  She&#39;d forgotten to milk her original breasts!  Would she need to milk this newest row?  She stood up, then froze.  There was no way she&#39;d hide a second pair of J-cup breasts from her mother.  It wouldn&#39;t take her mom long to figure out what happened, either.  There was bound to be some punishment when her mother found out.  No, the second row of breasts was already the punishment.  Maybe hiding it would result in further punishment, and she was running out of space for more punishment.  She resolved to just face her mother and explain things plainly.  <br />
<br />
As she got to the stairs, she realized how much more daunting it was to descend the stairs than it was to go up them.  Her hooves had precious little space on each step, and her feet were bent at enough of an angle to make standing even worse.  She was obviously more front-heavy than back-heavy, and she couldn&#39;t see where she was walking at all.  Instead of testing her luck, she went down the stairs backwards until she reached the ground-level.<br />
<br />
Her mother was watching the television.  &quot;Mom, I found out what you did with the chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria broke concentration with a confused look, which immediately turned to glee as she took in her daughter&#39;s newest transformation.  &quot;Hah!  I forgot about setting that condition on you.  Four breasts really fits with your udders, if I do say so myself.&quot;  She stood up, approaching her daughter and tweaking the deformed nipple on her original pair.  &quot;Huh, looks a bit weird with them different like this.  Did you learn your lesson about accessing the chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna nodded.  &quot;I shouldn&#39;t try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.  Just so you know, you&#39;ll keep growing pairs of breasts each time you try.  I&#39;m not removing the rule, because I think it&#39;ll be interesting to see where they&#39;ll put your next pairs of breasts.  You&#39;re out of space as it is!&quot;  She paused, grabbing her phone.  &quot;I think you deserve a little reward for your first step toward being a good daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna shivered as she saw her tortured upper pair of nipples bulge and pinken.  How could her mother think making her nipples bigger be helpful?  She shifted in place, then realized from the waggling teats that this change included her second row of breasts as well.  Flipping one of the dangling masses up, she realized her nipples had been replaced by what was most likely more udder teats.  Her mind raced with possible interpretations that her mother would like that&#39;d still be truthful.  &quot;Uh... Thank you for... making, my nipples into teats better suited for... milking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl!  Now you can use your breasts as even more practice for your udder.&quot;  With a few clicks, she looked back up to her daughter.  &quot;As one more benefit, I&#39;ve altered reality to your new, four-breasted self.  You&#39;ll find your bra now caters to your unique needs.  Now, get ready for school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna nodded, then left for the milk machine.  It took the machine a mere 10 minutes to handle her regular breasts, and she had to admit having teats was infinitely less painful than her first use of the machine.  With little left to do, she returned to her room to rest.<br />
<br />
It was awkward, to say the least.  Her legs now hung over the far side of her bed, and her sensitive lower udder made most positions terribly distracting.  Sleeping on a side was out of the question as it placed one of her heavy legs on top of the udder.  Sleeping on her stomach felt lumpy due to the difference in size between her udder and breasts.  Sleeping on her back caused unwanted pressure as her two udders fought for space.  She eventually settled on a half-seated resting position, using her legs to prop her larger udder up and away from the other.<br />
<br />
With nothing else to focus on, sleep eventually found her.</p>
