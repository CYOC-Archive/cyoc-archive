<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s Note/Preface: What you are about to read is a story, but it is also much more than that. It is a wish written down in the hopes that maybe somehow it might come true. This is a warning because it’s quite lengthy, and parts of it aren’t especially well written. It exists not for your enjoyment, but because writing it down makes it one step closer to reality for me. Others may find it enjoyable, but that’s not why it was written. <br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
	While going about his usual morning business, Kevin went to pick up the mail and discovered the medallion with a note taped to it which read, &quot;This medallion is magical. It can be used to make magical wagers and make your lives more interesting. Please use it responsibly.&quot; After reading the note, Kevin looked at the medallion. He turned the golden piece of jewelry over in his hand. It looked ancient, and was inscribed with all manner of runes and characters that he did not recognize. He didn&#39;t believe in this sort of thing. The very notion that something was magical seemed ridiculous to him. Even so, something about the medallion made him consider that maybe it was the real deal, or at least worth showing to his roommates. <br />
<br />
	Kevin lived with three of his friends, they all attended the same college, and would be seniors in the fall, except for Kevin himself who would be a junior. As each of his roommates woke up, he showed them what he had found. Scott, Andrew, and Reed were all skeptical, but still very eager to test the medallion&#39;s power, so they devised a simple bet that would determine whether or not it really worked. <br />
<br />
	&quot;So here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking,&quot; Kevin announced, &quot;we&#39;ll do a simple high card draw from a deck of cards. Winner will win Publisher&#39;s Clearing House, a million dollars a year for life. Sound good?&quot; The others agreed. Kevin grabbed a deck of cards, shuffled it a few times, and dealt out a card to each of them. Scott was dealt the Jack of Clubs, Reed the 7 of Hearts, Andrew the Queen of Diamonds, and Kevin the 3 of Spades. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Looks like it&#39;s my lucky day!&quot; Andrew said sarcastically, still not believing that anything would happen. The four were about to give up and chalk the whole thing up some weird prank when the doorbell rang. They all answered the door together where balloons and a giant check greeted their shocked faces. <br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
Once the commotion had died down, the four sat down in the living room to discuss what had happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, we have a magical medallion.&quot; Reed stated. <br />
<br />
&quot;It looks that way&quot; Kevin replied, &quot;I mean, you didn&#39;t even enter publisher&#39;s clearing house, did you?&quot; he asked, looking at Andrew. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, it definitely seems like the real deal. I don&#39;t have any other explanation.&quot; Andrew answered, still in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do with it?&quot; Scott asked, &quot;Do you think we should mess around with something this powerful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we&#39;re careful about our wording, I think we&#39;ll be fine. It seems to have worked out pretty well so far.&quot; said Andrew, pointing to his giant check. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Reed agreed, &quot;we&#39;ll have to be careful, but I definitely think we should make another bet.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;What do you guys want to bet on?&quot; Andrew asked, &quot;Something a little less random than high card draw might make it more interesting, but it should be something that none of us has a huge advantage at either, that way we all stand a chance at winning.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;How about Mario Kart 8?&quot; Scott suggested, &quot;That has some skill, but we all have a chance at winning. We could do a single race. Obviously we&#39;ll be racing against each other not the AI, so the winner will be whoever places the best out of the four of us, and the loser will be whoever places the worst out of the four of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That works for me.&quot; said Kevin, &quot;What&#39;s the bet going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well I&#39;ve already won a shit-load of money, so let&#39;s do something else for the winner, how about winner gets to have sex with any girl they want. One night of fantastic, awesome sex with the girl of your choice.&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m down for that!&quot; Reed said with a smile. The rest of the group agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait just a second though, maybe the loser should have a negative consequence, nothing huge or permanent, just enough so that there&#39;s more reason to actually try.&quot; Scott said. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you have in mind?&quot; Andrew asked.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well I was thinking that if the winner gets any girl they want, the loser should become a girl, just from now through the weekend. And for starters, Kevin, since you like DC comics so much, I think you should change into Wonder Woman if you lose.&quot; Scott said,  &quot;And since you were singing songs from Frozen when we got drunk, I think you should transform into Elsa if you lose.&quot; he said to Andrew.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Andrew replied, &quot;but since you like Zelda games so much, you&#39;re going to change into Princess Zelda if you lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Reed asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you lose, since I know you like your anime, you&#39;ll become Asuna from Sword Art Online.&quot; Kevin replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Reed consented, &quot;but just to clarify, these transformations will only affect our bodies, not our minds, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Andrew agreed, &quot;While we&#39;re at it, as an added precaution since we’ve only used this thing once, let&#39;s say that the terms of the bet can be amended even after it&#39;s over, but only if we all agree on the changes. That way we can fix it if something goes wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One more thing,&quot; Reed added, &quot;the loser is off limits to the winner. The winner can have any girl they want except the loser.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good call.&quot; Andrew concurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do we all agree to the terms of the bet?&quot; Scott asked. <br />
<br />
	The others all voiced their agreement and booted up the game. They selected their characters and a track and began to race. Scott and Kevin pulled out in front off the start, Andrew not far behind, while Reed had messed up the start and was trying to catch up. At the end of the first lap, Scott was in first, Kevin in third, Andrew in fourth, and Reed in ninth place. In the second lap, Reed got a blue shell and used it to knock Scott out of the lead allowing Kevin to move into first. Reed passed Andrew and then Scott using a Bullet Bill. After the second lap, Kevin was in the lead with Reed close behind him, while Scott was in fifth and Andrew in sixth. During the final lap, Andrew overtook Scott using a red shell, only to be passed by Scott again who used a star to knock him out of the way and caused him to go off the track. Just before the finish, Reed clipped Kevin with a green shell and snuck past for the win. Kevin finished second, Scott in fourth, and Andrew in seventh place. <br />
<br />
	Reed was so caught up in trying to decide who to choose for his &#39;prize&#39; that he barely noticed when Andrew announced that he felt like he was going to puke. Andrew hurried over to the bathroom, but by the time he got there the queasiness had gotten worse. Not even bothering to close both doors, he barely had a chance to look in the mirror and see that the changes had already begun. His eyes had become a brighter, more vivid shade of blue. His face had started to change, becoming more feminine, while the rest of his body followed suit, shrinking about two inches in height and slimming down to a very slender physique. He broke out into a cold sweat, it felt like he had the flu. His internal organs were starting to change into their female equivalent. At this point he couldn&#39;t hold it back anymore, and knelt down to the toilet and threw up. Holding the toilet for support, he noticed his hands had gotten smaller and looked very feminine, his nails looked manicured, and his skin was softer, smoother, and lighter in tone than it had been moments ago. While looking at his new hands, a lock of platinum blonde hair fell into view, much lighter than the dirty blonde it had been before. It grew longer and longer, until it stopped and then began tying itself into a braid. Still feeling nauseous, he felt his manhood start to recede while at the same time two breasts began to push out from his chest, tingling as they grew. They stopped at a very perky, full B-cup, almost C-cup that suited his new frame perfectly. Then as his manhood shrank away to nothing, it felt as though he had been kicked in the groin hard, as his, now her, genitals finished changing into their female counterparts and her hips popped into a feminine form. She now had a nice flat venus mound and vulva. The brief but intense pain had caused her to let out a very feminine sounding groan before she slipped unconscious. As she lay on the floor of the bathroom, her clothes transformed into Elsa&#39;s dress.<br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
	Scott, Kevin, and Reed heard the noise and decided to check and make sure their friend was okay. They discovered the freshly transformed girl lying on the floor unconscious with a thin layer of frost emanating out around her and tiny icicles hanging off the toilet and sink. They carefully carried her upstairs to her room and laid her down on her bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d get Elsa&#39;s powers too. Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea.&quot; Scott said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me either, but I guess that was included, we specified bodies only, but apparently that includes powers&quot;. Reed pointed out. &quot;but since he, or well I guess she, is still the same person, controlling them shouldn&#39;t be as big of an issue. She doesn&#39;t have any reason to be afraid of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point.&quot; Scott agreed, still slightly concerned.<br />
<br />
	At that, the girl on the bed started to wake up. &quot;How long.........How long was I out?&quot; Andrew asked, obviously surprised at the sound of her own voice, which sounded just like Idina Menzel&#39;s voice acting in Frozen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only a few minutes.&quot; Scott told her. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Much better now actually, that transformation was kinda rough.&quot; Andrew replied, the memory of her change still very vivid in her mind, &quot;This new body is also really, really weird, not bad, just really, really weird. It&#39;s definitely going to take some getting used to.&quot; She paused, &quot;I see my clothes must have changed after I passed out; wearing this dress feels so strange. And I can&#39;t tell you how weird it is just to talk and hear a voice that&#39;s different come out. Like, you know when you hear a recording of yourself talk and you think, &#39;Do I really sound like that?&#39;, it&#39;s kinda like that, but in real time.&quot; Andrew finished, taking a breath. It was a lot to process all at once.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s really strange.&quot; Reed acknowledged, &quot;just try and take it easy for a bit though, though.&quot; he said. The girl on the bed gave a slight nod of agreement. &quot;By the way, what do you want us to call you? It seems wrong to call you Andrew right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right, ummm.....&quot; she paused, thinking for a moment, &quot;I guess you can call me Anna. The first syllable is the same, so that might make it easier for me to pick up on it. There&#39;s no way in hell you&#39;re calling me Elsa, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about &#39;your royal highness&#39;?&quot; Reed joked. Scott looked at him like he&#39;d just poked a bear, afraid that a poorly timed joke might result in a blizzard.<br />
<br />
	However, Anna managed to laugh it off, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s weird enough adjusting to this new body, okay?&quot; she said with a chuckle, &quot;Give me a little while before you jump in with the teasing.&quot; she said, blushing slightly out of embarrassment but forcing a smile anyway. Scott seemed relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; Reed offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you seem you be taking this pretty well.&quot; Scott pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Anna agreed, &quot;I mean it&#39;s not really that bad, it&#39;s just incredibly weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyway uh, And...Anna,&quot; Scott said, correcting himself, &quot;there&#39;s probably something else you should know before you do anything else. After you changed, the bathroom looked like the inside of a freezer. We think you might have Elsa&#39;s powers as well as her body.&quot; <br />
<br />
	&quot;No way, Really?!&quot; Anna said excitedly, her bright blue eyes widening, &quot;that&#39;s awesome! Here, let&#39;s see...&quot; she pointed her hand at the window and ice began to crystalize over the glass. &quot;This is incredible! Having magical powers makes this way better.&quot; she said, clamoring to the edge of the bed, inhibited by the long dress she was wearing, &quot;but right now I&#39;m dying to see myself in a mirror.&quot; As she swung her legs off the bed she noticed she was wearing heels, which must have come with the dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;So much for taking it easy.&quot; Reed muttered, laughing to himself.<br />
<br />
	Anna stood up slowly, holding the bed frame for support, her new body combined with the high heels making even standing up somewhat challenging. She found enough balance to stand, but walking in heels was still quite tricky. She managed to traverse her room to the upstairs bathroom, however, and looking in the mirror she finally saw herself fully transformed. She really did look just like Elsa in the flesh. She was stunningly beautiful. Everything about her body was perfect. She&#39;d never seen anyone as beautiful as she had become.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wow, I look amazing!&quot; she said aloud to herself, partly just to hear her new voice. She could already tell this wasn&#39;t going to be the negative consequence it was conceived as. She was actually enjoying her new body, though she wouldn&#39;t let her friends know that.<br />
<br />
	As she was appreciating her own beauty, she began to notice some unfamiliar sensations of arousal. She really wanted to see what she looked like underneath that dress, but there would be time for that later. That thought reminded her of something however. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Reed, who did you end up picking for your win?&quot; Anna asked as she stumbled in her high heels back to the door frame separating her room from the bathroom. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Actually, I haven&#39;t picked yet. We wanted to make sure you were okay first.&quot; Reed answered, &quot;on that note though, what was the name of that girl you showed me on your dating app?&quot; Reed had had a crush on this girl from the moment he saw her picture on his friends phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Francesca?&quot; Anna replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the one. Is she fair game?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well she&#39;s probably not going to be interested in me while I&#39;m like this, so if she&#39;s the one you want, go for it.&quot; said Anna. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Cool, as long as you&#39;re okay with it, I choose Francesca.&quot; Reed said, and as soon as he finished saying the words, his phone rang. He answered the call in the other room, and when he returned, he explained that it started as a wrong number, but by the end of their extremely brief conversation she was &#39;dying to meet him&#39; and that she was on her way and would be there in an hour. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Well, I guess that worked then,&quot; Scott pointed out, as if there was still any doubt of the medallion&#39;s power, &quot;it looks like we might want to get out of the house for a while.&quot; he suggested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot; agreed Kevin. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, only one problem,&quot; Anna interjected, &quot;I can&#39;t really go out in public wearing this thing,&quot; she said, gesturing to her dress, &quot;I&#39;ll look ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that I can barely walk in these heels. You guys think you could do me a favor?&quot; Anna asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you need?&quot; Kevin responded. <br />
<br />
	&quot;This might be awkward, but do you think you guys could go buy me some clothes? I&#39;ll give you the money, just buy something normal for me to wear. I&#39;ll give you my measurements and if the cashiers give you any crap you can just make up something about your sister or girlfriend or whatever. Please?&quot; Anna asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I suppose we could do that.&quot; Reed said, &quot;I, uh, need a few things from the store before Francesca gets here anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great,&quot; Scott chimed in, &quot;more awkward purchases.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Scott, Kevin, and Reed went to the store armed with Anna&#39;s measurements and a list of articles of clothing to buy. <br />
<br />
	At the store, Reed picked up a box of condoms, while Scott and Kevin grabbed a tank top, shorts, flip flops, a package of basic bikini cut panties, and a bra, all in the correct sizes. They went for fairly basic styles, and even with their limited fashion sense, they were at least able to pick out things that matched. <br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
	While they were out, Anna was all alone in the house. She enjoyed having a moment to herself. She had ditched the high heels so she could actually walk around the house. With nobody around, she sat in her room and cupped her breasts through her dress, hefting their weight, feeling them jiggle. She wasn&#39;t wearing a bra, and as she ran her fingers over her nipples she felt them stiffen. This elicited another tingling spark of unfamiliar arousal. She desperately wanted to rip off her dress and find out what a female orgasm felt like, but her friends could be home any minute and getting caught in the act would result in more teasing than she cared to think about. Instead, she decided to cool off quite literally by testing out her powers. <br />
<br />
	She went out into the backyard where nobody would see, and started by trying to make an ice sculpture. She succeeded instantly in making a miniature Eiffel Tower, but unlike most ice sculptures, all the beams were actually individual, separate beams. The level of rich detail was surprising even to Anna. The sculpture was almost too easy, so she decided to go bigger. She swept her hand in front of her, and as she did the backyard transformed into a winter wonderland. Every blade of grass was covered in frost. Snow drifts piled up against the fence which was covered in ice. Icicles hung from the tree. All of this in the middle of summer. Anna was appreciating her handiwork when her friends arrived home. They marveled at the magic she had worked, which was slowly melting in the summer heat. She felt like she could have easily maintained it if she wanted to, but let it melt away so the neighbors wouldn&#39;t suspect anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope everything fits&quot; Scott said as he handed Anna the bag of clothes they had purchased. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Anna said, grateful, &quot;thanks for doing that by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; Scott replied. <br />
<br />
	Anna took the clothes up to her room and shut the door behind her. She dumped the clothes on her bed and with some difficulty managed to slip out of the dress. For the first time, she saw her new body completely naked. Seeing breasts from a new perspective was definitely different, but she still thought they looked perfect. Her figure was stunning. Her skin was flawless, without a freckle, mole, wrinkle, or blemish of any kind. It was silky smooth and soft. She looked further down and saw nothing but a small, neat patch of very lightly colored pubic hair. Bending over further she saw her vulva. It was strange to see one from this angle, but it still looked better than any other she had seen before. Her hand found its way to where she was looking, just gently and hesitantly gliding over the absence where her male genitals had once been. She thought about sticking a finger in just to see what it felt like, even the thought of which was enough to make her wet, but she wanted to experience it the right way, and a quickie right now wouldn&#39;t do it justice. <br />
<br />
	Anna laid the dress down on the bed and picked up the bra, struggling to put it on properly. They were hard enough to get off, let alone put on. The soft padding felt nice on her breasts. They didn&#39;t need much support, but the bra felt nice nonetheless, even if it was mildly constrictive. Next, she put on the panties, which felt very peculiar, resting flat against her new genitals. They didn&#39;t cover any of her legs like the boxers she was used to. She put on the shorts next, which were so short that she still didn&#39;t feel fully dressed. Although they would seem perfectly normal to anyone else, Anna was used to wearing men&#39;s shorts that went almost to the knee. These left much more of her smooth, feminine legs exposed which was a somewhat foreign feeling to her. The pockets of the shorts were a joke, she tried putting her phone and wallet in them, but they stuck out of even the back pockets, however with no other options she decided this was good enough. Finally, she put on the tank top, which unlike the t-shirts she normally wore left all of her arms exposed and was cut lower along the neckline. Both the shorts and tank top were much tighter fitting than most clothes she was used to, and although they felt weird, they did make her look nice. She felt out of place wearing these clothes, but at least anyone else would see her as a regular girl, not a cosplay enthusiast or renaissance fair escapee. <br />
<br />
Once she was dressed, Anna went downstairs. &quot;So what do you guys want to do?&quot; she asked Scott and Kevin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well for starters we thought we&#39;d grab some lunch.&quot; Scott replied. &quot;Then I guess we can just decide from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Anna had lost her breakfast to the transformation and was only now realizing she had regained her appetite. The three of them headed out to eat, while Reed eagerly awaited Francesca&#39;s arrival. <br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
	Reed waited around the house alone, straightening up a few things, generally excited and impatient. He thought it was considerate of his friends to leave him the house, although deep down he knew they were doing it to get away from the ‘action’ and not to be nice. <br />
<br />
	Finally, after what seemed like ages, he heard the doorbell ring and went to great his ‘prize’. What ensued next was like a scene out of a porn film, except with less dialogue. The moment they made eye contact they barely had a chance to say hello before furiously and passionately making out. Reed was either too caught up in the moment to feel any awkwardness about the intimacy he was sharing with what was essentially a total stranger, or simply didn’t care. He wasn’t sure which. One of the most gorgeous women he had ever seen was making out with him and that was all that mattered. <br />
<br />
	It didn’t take long for the two of them to move on from just making out to starting to tear at each other’s clothes. Reed led her to his bedroom while they continued to attack each other. Francesca forcefully pulled Reed’s shirt off before crossing her arms and sexily removing her own shirt. At this moment Reed paused for half a second to appreciate the beauty of the girl in front of him. She had a beautiful, subtle hourglass figure and and incredibly sexy eyes. She had shoulder length blonde hair which was already messy from their vigorous make out session. Her lips were slightly pouty and very seductive. Underneath the shirt she was no longer wearing she wore a lacy, bright red bra. She promptly removed her bra while Reed’s hands ran up and over her hips and up further to caress her boobs. She slipped out of her pants and exposed a matching red thong with just a hint of camel toe, and a visible damp patch where she had already soaked through them. She pushed him down onto his mattress, climbing on top of him. Reed wasn’t sure if it was the magic of the medallion or her personality but Francesca didn’t seem to be interested in foreplay. <br />
<br />
	The two of them made passionate love all afternoon, stopping only briefly to catch their breath. The sex was amazing and they seemed to be perfectly in sync despite never having met before. The sex was the best Reed had ever had, each time he felt completely spent, but recovered very quickly. Francesca seemed to be enjoying it almost as much, never seeming to tire even slightly. Every time they went at it, it was at least as good if not better than the previous round. The pair barely even stopped to eat dinner, they simply ordered a pizza and ate it in bed. They continued into the night, before finally falling asleep at midnight, exhausted and sore, but very content. When Reed woke the next morning she was already long gone. <br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
	Scott, Anna, and Kevin had a much more wholesome day compared to Reed and Francesca’s. They left the house in the late morning and piled into the hot car to go to lunch. Scott complained about the heat, and without hesitating, Anna said, “Hang on, I got it.” and used her powers to quickly cool the car down to a chilly but pleasant temperature, colder than the air conditioner could have managed. <br />
<br />
	They arrived at their destination and ordered their food. When they sat down at the table, Anna noticed her bare legs touching the chair, which was not something she was used to. This, combined with the absent feeling in her groin where her manhood had been caused her to restlessly cross and uncross her legs while they ate. Although she had been quite hungry, Anna found herself unable to eat the same quantities of food she normally would have, and she hadn’t been a heavy eater as a guy. She attributed this to her new smaller physique as well as the stress of her transformation. <br />
<br />
	The three of them decided to go bowling for the afternoon. It seemed like a fun way to pass the time, and it would keep them out of the house for a few hours. They arrived at the bowling alley and swapped their footwear for bowling shoes. Anna forgot her new shoe size when the cashier asked her, and asked for a size 9, which although she was given a women&#39;s size 9 was still too big. She swapped them out for a smaller pair, and as she returned to their lane, Scott produced the medallion. <br />
<br />
“Up for another bet?” he asked his two friends, neither of whom suspected he would bring the medallion. <br />
<br />
	“Not for me, I think my luck ran out after the first bet. Don’t let that stop you if you guys want to bet with each other though.” Anna said, reflecting on her win and subsequent loss. <br />
<br />
“How about you Kevin, up for it?” Scott asked eagerly. <br />
<br />
“I guess that depends on what the bet would be.” Kevin replied. <br />
<br />
	“Well how about winner gets a new car, any car they want, and the loser will become half their current age for 24 hours. Their clothes will also change with them” Scott proposed. <br />
<br />
	“That’s a weird losing consequence.” Kevin said. Before their previous bet, he still hadn’t been completely convinced of the medallion’s power, which was why he so willingly agreed to the possibility of becoming a girl, but now that his friend had been transformed, he had no doubts and was more reticent to agree to a transformation.  <br />
<br />
	“Oh yeah, half your age is crazy, that’s totally where I would draw the line too.” Anna said sarcastically “Come on, don’t be such a pussy. It’s only for one day, and you’ll sleep through half of it, that’s nothing compared to what I got.” Kevin couldn’t find any fault with her reasoning, so he agreed to the bet.<br />
<br />
	Anna bowled first since she wasn’t participating in this round of betting. Her ball went almost straight into the gutter, she was embarrassed to admit it, but the fourteen pound ball she had chosen was too heavy for her to use properly, it felt like she was trying to bowl with a sixteen pound ball. She swapped it out for a ten pound ball and managed to knock a few pins down. Despite the new equipment, the rest of her round wasn’t much better, her lack of coordination in her new body making bowling a tricky prospect. At least she didn’t have anything riding on this game.<br />
<br />
	Kevin seemed to have forgotten that Scott was actually a talented bowler, while he himself was fairly average. He actually managed to bowl a decent game, but in the end, it wasn’t enough, and Scott won. <br />
<br />
	Scott already knew what he wanted, and chose a Ferrari 458 Italia for his prize, as soon as he voiced his decision, car keys materialized in the air in front of him, falling into his open hand with a jingle. His new car was sitting in the parking lot. <br />
<br />
	Kevin’s transformation was nowhere near as rough as Anna’s had been. As his body regressed in age and he went through puberty in reverse, all he felt was a dull ache all over, much like growing pains, but in reverse. His clothes changed as he went down in years, until there was an 11 year old version of Kevin standing where a 22 year old had stood a moment ago. Besides Scott and Anna, nobody else seemed to take note of the change. <br />
<br />
	Scott went outside to go inspect his prize while Kevin took stock of his younger body. Since they still had a considerable amount of time to kill, they decided to bowl a few more games, this time without the betting. Anna improved as she became slightly more coordinated in her new body, but Kevin had the same problem she had been having, his younger, smaller body lacked the strength and coordination to bowl well. <br />
<br />
	Once they had their fill of bowling it was approaching dinner time, so they went to grab a bite to eat. Scott drove his new car, while Anna drove Kevin in Kevin’s car since he was far too young to drive now. At the restaurant, Kevin lamented the fact that he couldn’t order a beer along with his meal. Anna commiserated with him, since her ID didn’t look anything like her at the moment. Scott wasn’t old enough to drink, so he merely listened to his friends complain. Anna picked up the tab, since although her transformation had distracted her, she remembered that she had basically won the lottery that morning. <br />
 <br />
	Still intent on staying out of the house, they went to see a movie after dinner. Before they found their seats, Anna realized that she really needed to use the bathroom. She’d been putting it off since halfway through their last bowling game because she was still a little uncomfortable with her new body. She went towards the bathrooms, almost walking into the men’s room out of habit. She corrected herself and went into the women’s room. As she gazed at the long row of stalls, she felt out of place, even though she was in the appropriate room for her current body. Anna entered a stall with some slight trepidation and went about her business. It was a very bizarre feeling, relieving herself through her new internal plumbing. She finished and wiped herself clean. As she washed her hands, her reflection in the mirror reminded her how beautiful her new body was. She left the bathroom and proceeded to rejoin her friends as they entered the theater. <br />
<br />
	The movie was a good experience for Kevin and Anna, it took their minds off their respective transformations and gave them a chance to decompress and relax and simply enjoy the film. Once the movie was over, it was late enough that they finally decided to head home. Kevin wasn’t hating his change as much as he though he would, while Anna was actually really starting to like hers. <br />
<br />
	As the three of them arrived home, Scott parked his Ferrari in the garage. Reed and Francesca were finally beginning to wind down. Kevin was exhausted in his new younger body and went straight to bed. Scott and Anna both decided to retire to their respective rooms as well. Inside her room, Anna closed and locked her door. She walked into the adjoining bathroom and once again gazed at herself in the mirror. It still felt like she was looking at someone else, even though the figure in the mirror followed her every move. The reflection mimicked the mischievous smile that had appeared on her own face as she had an idea. <br />
<br />
	She returned to her bedroom and stripped off her shirt and removed her shorts. This time there was nothing to stop her from having a bit of fun. She unhooked her bra and tossed it on the bed, and proceeded to start gently fondling her breasts. It didn’t take long for her new body to be awash with new and unfamiliar sensations. One hand ventured down to her moistening new sex. She began to massage her clit through her panties. The amount of pleasure this elicited made her feel weak in the knees, so she sat on the edge of the bed and peeled away the panties that were in her way. As she continued to gently rub at her clit, she was surprised at how little stimulation it took to yield intense pleasure. Light touches were all that were necessary to evoke an involuntary moan of feminine ecstasy. She experimentally started circling her wet new opening with one finger before slowly sliding it inside. She laid back on the bed, slowly working her finger in and out of her tight vagina. Her pleasure continued to grow more and more intense, before she finally succumbed to wave after wave of powerful orgasm washing over her entire body, many times more pleasurable and considerably longer than even the best orgasm she ever had as a guy. Although she didn’t know it yet, even her least pleasurable orgasms in this new body would be better than the best she had as a guy. Anna fell asleep basking in the afterglow of her first female orgasm, still naked.<br />
<br />
—————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
	Anna woke up late the next morning, half expecting the previous day to have been an incredibly detailed dream, but as she sat up she was immediately aware that it was all entirely real. This did not upset her, however. Even if it had been a dream, it would have been a good one, and she wasn’t ready for it to end. One day in her new body was enough to make her want to keep it.<br />
<br />
	Once everyone was awake, Kevin still young at least for a few more hours and Reed exhausted and sore from the copious amounts of spirited sex he’d had the day before, Anna broke the news to her friends that she wanted to amend her bet to make it permanent. <br />
<br />
	“I know it might sound a little crazy, but I’ve thought about it and I want to keep this new body indefinitely.” she confessed. She was extremely embarrassed telling this to her friends, but she hoped they would be supportive. “This new body is flawless, and I don’t want to give up my powers” she explained, “I hope you don’t think I’m some kind of weirdo…”<br />
<br />
	Reed stopped her, “No way, not at all,” he said, “I completely understand; I would probably do the same thing in your shoes. You have a really unique opportunity to see life from a female perspective, and I certainly don’t blame you for wanting to take advantage of that, and when you consider your powers on top of that, I wouldn’t want to give it up either.”<br />
<br />
	Scott piped in, “I don’t think it’s weird either, after all, I came up with the part of the bet that made this happen so I can’t really say it’s that weird. And I can certainly see why you want to keep your new body, you look like a supermodel and you have magical powers, what’s not to like about that?”<br />
<br />
	“Thanks guys, that actually means a lot. But if I’m going to stay like this, some things are going to need to change. I want reality to be altered to make it as if I had always had this body. No major changes to my life, just the details that would need to change due to my new body. I’ve made a list of people including myself who won’t be affected by this change, so all of your memories of me won’t change. According to the terms of the bet, I need all of you to consent to me altering the terms, so what do you say?” she asked. <br />
<br />
	They all agreed, and the medallion emitted a bright flash of light. Nothing appeared to have changed at first, but when Anna went upstairs to see what had changed, several things were different. She checked the closet where she kept her button down shirts, which had become more feminine in style. Hanging beside the shirts she found there were two sundresses, a slightly more formal looking black dress, and somewhat surprisingly the dress she had been wearing after she changed. In her room, she found that the rest of her clothes had changed into female versions, and her selection of clothing had expanded to feature more feminine items. Basic things like t-shirts and shorts merely changed in size and cut, but there were many new items, including more feminine tops and even a few skirts. Her underwear had all changed pretty drastically, becoming a wide assortment of styles and patterns that were totally unrelated to what had been there previously, as well as bras that had come out of nowhere. Her existing shoes changed had only changed into women&#39;s sizes, but there were now new shoes, including flats and one pair of heels that looked like they went with the formal dress, as well as the heels that she had struggled with yesterday. She found her wallet and pulled out her ID, which had her new name, height, sex, and picture.<br />
<br />
	Anna was relieved to find that her video game collection had remained unchanged, and that her TV and consoles were all just as she had left them. She fired up the Xbox, which recognized her and signed her in, displaying, “Hello, Anna” as it did. She turned it off and continued looking around her room. <br />
<br />
	The sheets on her bed stayed the same color, but the pattern on her comforter had become floral instead of striped. She checked the bathroom, and found that most of her toiletries like shampoo had changed into girly equivalents. There were a few basic make-up supplies, but it didn’t look like she normally used much if any at all, which didn’t surprise her since she looked perfect without it. She also noticed a box of feminine hygiene products which reminded her that she would eventually have a need for them. Anna went back downstairs to tell her friends that it had worked. <br />
<br />
“I just checked on Facebook, your name and everything changed. You’re even in my phone under your new name.” Scott announced.<br />
<br />
	Anna pulled out her own phone and confirmed it. She noticed that all her pictures had changed as well, they were all basically the same, the same poses and subjects, the only difference was that they now showed her new self. Her Facebook info page revealed that she listed herself as single, as well as ‘interested in women’. She knew she still only liked girls, but just now realized that this meant she was technically a lesbian. She was a little surprised that she was open about this fact on Facebook, but also slightly relieved since it meant she wouldn’t have to deal with ‘coming out’ to anyone. After a small amount of digging it appeared as though this hadn’t affected her relationships with her family or anything, which put her mind at ease. Anna had no way of know this, but because of the way she had worded the amendment, she would keep Elsa’s body and powers indefinitely, meaning she wouldn’t age.<br />
<br />
“Well now that that’s taken care of, does anyone want to do a new bet?” Anna asked, eager to change the subject off of her and regain a sense of relative normality. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want to, but you guys can.” Kevin said, his voice cracking as he said it, which caused everyone else to chuckle. “shut up.” he said, obviously embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Oh lighten up, you’ve only got like a half hour left like that anyway.” Scott said.<br />
<br />
“Well I still don’t want to bet.” Kevin said bitterly. <br />
<br />
	“That’s fine, nobody’s forcing you.” Anna said with sympathy in her voice, “Anyway, I was thinking we could have a foot race, just a short sprint. The winner will find that all women will have an increased sexual attraction to them, regardless of those women&#39;s sexual orientation. The more attracted you are to them, the more attracted they will be to you. That’ll make romance a little easier for me, and I’m sure neither of you would mind a little help in that department. Oh, and to make things fair, if either of you win, I’ll be immune to the effect.”<br />
<br />
“So what happens if we lose?” Reed asked.<br />
<br />
“Nothing. This one will just have a prize. It seems like we’ve all had enough of the negative consequences for a while.” Anna said.<br />
<br />
“Hey, no fair!” Kevin said childishly, “I would’ve raced if I’d known there were no consequences!”<br />
<br />
“Too late, you already said no.” Scott goaded the young Kevin, “besides, you’re too young to be dating.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, what makes you think you can win a race anyway, yesterday you were practically tripping over yourself especially in those heels, today you want to run a race?” Reed said suspiciously. <br />
<br />
“I like my chances.” Anna said confidently. <br />
<br />
	On that rather blunt note, all four of them headed outside and walked to the nearby park, Kevin merely to spectate. They agreed on a start point and finish line, less than a hundred yards away. They lined up, and Kevin counted them down to a start. About halfway, Reed was in front, with Anna close behind, and Scott who was the least athletic of the group was slightly further behind her. As they drew closer to the finish line, Anna enacted her plan, using her powers to create a small patch of ice which caused Reed to slip and tumble unto the soft, forgiving grass, allowing Anna to dash past and win. Reed didn’t even have a scrape, but was still rather annoyed.<br />
<br />
“You cheated!” he said, slightly annoyed but still smiling and laughing at his friend’s trickery. <br />
<br />
“You didn’t say ‘no powers’” Anna said smugly as she helped her friend up. <br />
<br />
	As they were walking back, Kevin’s bet expired, and he began to grow back to his old self. This accelerated growth left him slightly sore and very hungry. The four decided to go get lunch. They briefly returned home because some of them wanted to change clothes and shower before they went out.<br />
<br />
	Anna went upstairs to the bathroom which adjoined her room, while Reed showered downstairs to remove the grass and dirt from his tumble. Anna hadn’t showered yet in her new body, even though she had already given it quite a bit of attention. She stripped off her clothes, taking a moment to admire herself in the mirror. Her beautiful body assured her that she had made a good decision staying this way. She realized she would need to take out the braid her hair had been in since her transformation. She unraveled her hair and stepped into the shower. The warm water felt cozy and comforting. The feeling of the water dripping over her body accentuated all the things that felt different about her new form, flowing over and between her breasts and down to the absence where her manhood used to be. Her wet hair clung to her neck and shoulders, something it had never been long enough to do before. She was caught up in her new body once again, but remembered that her friends would be waiting if she took too long. She shampooed and conditioned her hair, and washed the rest of her body fairly quickly. Since all the products had changed, she now smelled very feminine. She got out of the shower and toweled herself dry, but realized she would need to do something else to get her hair dry faster. Luckily, amongst the new accouterments in the bathroom was a hairdryer. She blow-dried her hair, and hastily looked up an instructional video to figure out how to properly braid her hair. She struggled doing this for the first time, but managed to make it resemble something close to what it had been when she first transformed. It wasn’t great, but it was better than she expected for a first effort and she at least looked presentable.<br />
<br />
	By the time Anna returned downstairs, her friends were in fact waiting for her. Kevin was starving and eager to leave, so they quickly left to go get food. Scott wanted to take his new car, but the others talked him out of it because it could only seat two. <br />
<br />
	Later that evening, Anna and Kevin decided to celebrate the fact that they were both once again able to get a drink by going out to the bar. Reed joined them, not needing any excuse to go out with his friends. Scott remained at home, since he was still too young to drink at the bar. Once they got their drinks, Reed shared some of the less explicit details of his night with Francesca. Anna began to notice that the alcohol had a greater effect on her lighter body, so she let her drink sit idle for a while as they continued to chat. When it got too warm for her taste she discretely used her powers to chill the glass and finished her drink. She went up to the bar to get another, where she noticed a very cute girl sitting a few empty seats away. The girl returned her glance. Anna moved closer and said hello, and offered to buy the girl a drink under the pretext of having won the lottery the previous day, which happened to be true. The girl seemed slightly taken aback at first, but then seemed genuinely interested by her advances.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is kinda strange for me,&quot; the girl said with infatuation in her voice, &quot;I mean I&#39;m straight...but I definitely find you attractive... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve had too much to drink or what, but what the hell, here&#39;s my number, I guess that doesn&#39;t hurt anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna returned to her friends who had witnessed the entire exchange and had been giving her a huge thumbs up the whole time. After they congratulated her, they continued to talk about the magical medallion and the amazing two days they had had. <br />
<br />
“It’s really been quite the whirlwind.” Kevin declared, the other nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
	“I’ve been thinking about that a little bit actually,” Anna said, “I mean I’ve already won a huge amount of money, Scott won a frickin’ Ferrari, what if people start putting two and two together? Both of our transformations don’t really attract attention, but all this stuff will.”<br />
<br />
Reed stared at his beer in consideration, understanding what Anna was getting at. Kevin gave a look of discontentment.<br />
<br />
	“So what are you saying, we should stop using it? Get rid of it or something?” Kevin asked, “Easy for you to say, you’ve been getting everything you want.” he said with just a hint of jealousy and anger in his voice.<br />
<br />
“No…” Anna replied, “I’m just saying that maybe we should put the bets on hold for a while, just to avoid suspicion.”<br />
<br />
	“She’s right,” Reed said, (Anna was still staggered by the use of feminine pronouns in reference to her), “If we keep going like this, someone is going to suspect something, and that’s asking for trouble. If we want to keep the medallion and benefit from it long term, we’re going to have to be careful. We’ve been fairly smart about it so far, let’s keep it that way.”<br />
<br />
	“Fine” Kevin agreed reluctantly. He knew they were right, but still wished he had won something himself. He knew he would have a chance eventually, but he would have to be patient.<br />
<br />
	When they returned, they told Scott what they talked about at the bar. He agreed with their reasoning. They all resolved to take a break from betting, so the next day they sealed the medallion in a safe. It remained there, dormant, where it would not be disturbed unless the four friends decided to use it once again. <br />
<br />
