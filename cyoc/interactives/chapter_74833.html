<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next couple hours saw Ty first increase all their heights; himself, Ash and Dustin grew to 6 foot even while Nate grew from 5'4' to 5'6''. Both Ash and Nate jogged home, wanting to put their muscles to use, while Ty and Dustin went inside their home. Everything about the home seemed brighter than before, and when the boys announced they were home, June came out from the living room and hugged them both. She's never hugged Ty before!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey June,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Tyler,&quot; she said, sounding exasperated, &quot;How many times must I tell you? Just call me mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry mom. I have a date tonight with a girl I met at the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you just met her a few hours ago? Your brother's right, you do work fast,&quot; June said with a chuckle, &quot;Well I guess it'll just be three of us for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys went up the stairs to their rooms, Ty feeling elated at how much more loving June was, to both of them according to Dustin. He said June had rarely hugged him either, unless it was to show off in some way. So they were both glad for the new life.<br />
<br />
After putting his towels and boardshorts in the laundry, Ty changed into a white t-shirt and blue plaid pyjama pants, his usual relaxing clothes, and spent the next couple hours on the computer; playing Counter-Strike and chatting on Facebook to Evelyn, who he'd promptly added. It was great to have Dustin as his friend now, and being part of a large circle of friends.<br />
<br />
When at last it was time for his date, Ty changed into a pair of blue plaid cargo shorts with a chain hanging between two pockets, and a dark grey t-shirt that was tight enough to show his muscles. He donned a dog-tag necklace around his neck, and his hightop sneakers of course. Then, after a quick fix of his hair, and using his powers to instantly wash and dry himself, he grabbed his wallet and cellphone and announced that he was off. &quot;Have fun dear!&quot; his mom called as he closed the door.<br />
<br />
He walked a bit to where the taxi would pick him up, and from there he teleported himself to Evelyn's house and rang the doorbell. When the door opened he saw a girl who was not Evelyn; she was about a year younger, but more developed; possessing a slim and noticeably curvy body, with decent sized-breasts and booty. It was clear though, from her brown hair and green eyes that she was Eve's sister.<br />
<br />
The moment she saw him, Ty noticed her expression shift to shocked. &quot;Are you Evelyn's date?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ty replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're real, AND you're hot,&quot; the girl said, &quot;I thought she'd made it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I'm real,&quot; Ty replied. &quot;I'm Tyler, nice to meet you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashlee,&quot; the girl replied, shaking his hand. &quot;My sister's a bit of a nerd, I didn't think she'd ever be asked out by someone like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a bit of a nerd myself,&quot; Ty responded, &quot;So is she ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Evelyn replied, appearing at the door in a grey t-shirt and baggy green cargo shorts, with sneakers. &quot;I'm ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wearing that on a date with a sexy beast like this?&quot; Ty heard Ashlee whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; Ty replied, &quot;Don't be so superficial, I like Eve because we have shared interests, her looks aren't a big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Ashlee replied with a shrug, &quot;Have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Eve joined him walking down the street. &quot;Did you mean that?&quot; Evelyn asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course! We like comics, and you know we could win any superhero cosplay contest I enter,&quot; Ty explained, flexing his bicep.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe guys like you like superheroes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually liked the superheroes first, it's why I wanted to get like this. Want to know my special secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's this special power I got for my birthday,&quot; Ty explained, &quot;The power of reality warping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Are you making fun of me?&quot; Evelyn asked, starting to sound like she might get upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not at all. Just pay attention to yourself,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
Evelyn looked down at her body for a moment, looking unimpressed, then her breasts, her A-cup breasts, began to expand in size, swelling up through B and C, straining her bra and pushing out her shirt. They stopped when they were double D-cup, and the changes didn't end there. The fat in Eve's body all melted away and was replaced with a slim, athletic body, causing her breasts to become more perky. Her hips flared out, giving her a curvy hourglass figure, while her booty grew larger and rounder, but firmer as well, looking heart-shaped, though currently covered by her clothes.<br />
<br />
Next her arms and legs, already toned by her newly athletic body, gained a slight touch up to make them more shapely, while her brown hair lost all its coarse frizziness and cascaded down her slim back like a brown waterfall, reaching her upper back. Her face became more shapely, though still distinctively hers, and she lost the need for glasses as her vision became perfect. She gained several inches in height, growing from 5'4'' to 5'8''.<br />
<br />
Finally her clothes changed; her shirt changed into a white tube-top that was conservative enough to be decent, but still showed her ample cleavage and left her flat, toned midriff bare, and her shorts changed to a denim short skirt that showed off her ass. Her shoes changed to a pair of sandals and she acquired a simple choker necklace.<br />
<br />
And then the changes were done, with the nerdy girl now looking more like a cheerleader than a nerd. &quot;There, a gift for our first date,&quot; Ty said, &quot;Instead of flowers or chocolates, you get a new body and new comics,&quot; he explained, making a mirror appear in front of Eve so she could look herself over.<br />
<br />
Her new face had full lips and eyelashes that needed no care, in fact she didn't need any make-up whatsoever, and she looked incredible; it was her dream body and she had to pinch herself several times to make sure it was real. Finally she turned to Ty and threw her arms around him. &quot;This is so incredible Ty!&quot; she cried, &quot;I can't believe you did this all. Is that how you and your friends got so huge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. This power let's us teleport too, so come on, let's go make all the people at Shive's Comics shit bricks,&quot; Ty said excitedly. &quot;Unless you want to eat first? Or go somewhere else.&quot;</p>
