<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah sat in the grassy pasture for some time as her thoughts mulled over the events of her past week. At last she got to her two feet and began to walk toward the barn.<br />
<br />
A shaky young lady looks over the fence at the cows and one young friendly bull. Climbing the fence she walked across the barnyard as she looked cautiously about. Still naked she had to find some clothes.<br />
<br />
Nothing was offered in or around the barn till she stood quiet for a minute and listened. The gentle breeze made a line strung full of yesterday's laundry flap a noise. Jogging around the house Sarah was delighted to see clothing which even if it did not fit well would allow her return to the city.<br />
<br />
As Sarah walked barefoot down the dusty country road her memory of that truck ride from the city to the country made her wonder. She had no idea which direction to walk toward home. A worse thought was how long the truck took from the city to where she was now. Her thoughts of riding in that truck were of learning her new body sensations and paid little real attention to road signs and where she was being taken.<br />
<br />
The light of day brought Sarah to a crossroad. US-31 and Blackman's Road had Sarah take the main highway North and on her way to home. A lonely piece of highway is no place for a barefoot pretty girl looking of Amish decent, and hitchhiking as well.<br />
<br />
A lucky chance that a van pulled up and Sarah ran to the drivers window. A soft and friendly voice came from a Christian businessman on his way to a Model Railroad Flea Market. Sarah jumped quickly into the passenger front seat and relished in the heat pouring over her bare feet from the vehicle's heater.<br />
<br />
Sarah could not tell the man her week long sabbatical while living as part of a herd. Therefore she began to spin a story of being taken for a one way ride by some guy. She told on not wanting his affections and for this she was dumped naked out into a pasture. She stole her clothes from a clothes line by an Amish home, then walked to the highway.<br />
<br />
The man listened and took pity on Sarah. After four hours driving along the lights of her town peaked the hill. As Sarah pointed the way<br />
the man drove her right to the front of her parents home. An exchange of phone numbers and Sarah waived a good bye to her new friend.<br />
<br />
Using the front door key hidden under a pile of latex dog crap her Father had purchased while on a trip to Chicago she was soon in her warm and safe home. <br />
<br />
Checking the house she found nobody home and wondering she headed for a hot shower and some clothes which did fit. Soon relaxed and clean of all scents of cow life she folded up the Amish clothes for ultimate return some day. Sarah knew she needed a story for her disappearance, the story told to the nice man would never work because her parents would have the guy strung up for doing such a thing. Who could she accuse of doing such a thing, she couldn't.<br />
<br />
A quick call to her Uncle at the Museum had him driving over to pick her up.<br />
<br />
Sarah in tears told her Uncle of the Medallion and it's strange powers. She told of being changed into a cow and Boris having her shipped out and sold to a farmer. As they drove along she poured out the story in some detail while her Uncle just listened.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true, you do believe me Uncle?&quot; asked Sarah still in tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sarah, I do believe you! I talked with Boris, he told me of the calf he let the painter's use as a model and then not knowing how it got in the museum he had it picked up. He didn't tell me the calf was sold to someone! I called Detective Ambrose Martin after the Medallion was found on the floor of your office. I asked him why he gave the medallion to the Museum and insisted it be in-cased for protection. I thought it was for protection from the elements, wrong! He wished it protected from use by people and told me of dozens he knew of had lost their humanity to the thing. Now I'm thrilled you are back home and was fortuned enough to have wished for only one week, less you spend the rest of your life as a dairy cow.&quot; explained Sarah's Uncle.<br />
<br />
Sarah felt relieved that her story was proved out and that her dear Uncle was not angry with her. The two of them began to make up a good story to tell both her parents and the authorities all now looking for Sarah.<br />
<br />
As Sarah walked with her Uncle into her office, there sitting solidly afloat in a cube of Plexiglas was the Medallion.<br />
<br />
Seeing the helpless thing Sarah burst into tears and fell to her knees. Looking up at her Uncle she blubbered out, &quot;I was happy! I was not alone we were a herd, I was a part of the herd and really felt like I belonged there. I was at ease with all around me and one my second day met a fella.&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;A man paid attention to a heifer cow?&quot; asked her Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, he was a Holstein yearling bull! We played games till I stood silent when he mounted me. Oh Uncle it was such a thrill to feel his long shaft enter my body! I then began to lust for his attentions!&quot; told Sarah as her Uncle's eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many times did this bull mount you?&quot; asked a shaky voiced Uncle.<br />
<br />
Sarah hearing his voice crack replied, &quot;Dozens maybe, I lost count and even then cared only for feeling it again and again, how many meant nothing to me then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if your pregnant with his calf, did you consider being a Mother to a calf or something half human?&quot; asked Uncle as Sarah clutching her stomach began to cry.</p>
