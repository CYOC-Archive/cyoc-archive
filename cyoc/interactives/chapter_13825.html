<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking back at those seated along the bar Ken wonders what happened to the lady? He stands for a moment contemplating the idea of walking through the door himself and learn if what he saw was real.<br />
<br />
Reaching for the door he was about to open it when the door was pushed open. The Security Guard coming back alone walked out of the darkness beyond or within giving Ken a nasty look. A look as if what was inside was not his business and he might best go back and enjoy the bar.<br />
<br />
A notion to consider as Ken stood there watching the door close slowly as the Guard walked away without even a look back to Ken. <br />
<br />
Quickly Ken's fingers grabbed the door before it closed. Opening it wide he stepped through it with a casual look back to the batr and those seated there. No not one of those seated there looked his way or maybe even gave a care if he should enter.<br />
<br />
Into the gloomy darkness Ken stepped the door closing behind him he looked down a hallway. Dark, musty smelling the hallway had while the door was open a breeze but once closed the air fell dank, damp, and again very humidly musty.<br />
<br />
Walking slowly down the hallway it tended to drop in elevation as if he was walking into a cellar. Maybe a wine cellar thought Ken but why would the Guard take that drunken lady into a place like that, it didn't reason?<br />
<br />
Ken stopped at the junction to a hallway which turned off to the right. It seemed a breeze was drafting from ahead of him and turning down the hallway to the right. He wondered which one to follow till he definately heard a crude scream come from straight ahead.<br />
<br />
Heading forward at a fast walk Ken's suspecions urged him to move faster and once finding what happened to the lady he'd either help her or get the heck out of here!<br />
<br />
The hallway was getting better lighted as he proceeded forward. The air movement too was more but smelled now musty but also like the wretchid odor of a slaughter house. The hallway here was lighted by florecent lights making Ken's eyes squint.<br />
<br />
A scream, one of such a horrid sound it sent a chill up Ken's spine. Another and then one long scream which seemed to echo the concrete walls of the hall. <br />
<br />
Voices now, two or three men talking as moans of someone else mixed in occasionally. Ken came to a corner again peering around it with obvious caution. A room, and three men standing around a table talking as they would look off to one side as if they were taking note of something just out of Ken's view.<br />
<br />
What to do, Ken could not walk forward less the men notice him pass their door. He couldn't just step inside and ask what he heard or what happened to the lady he seen up in the bar either. Turning to maybe walk away from the door and forget his impetuous galant feelings, Ken  stopped. As with a moaning sound from the room his passion to be of help returned and taking a deep breath he walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Greeting the men as if he was part of their company he looked to their  immediate left. His eyes went wide at the sight, maybe his glance made his body english give him away as one of the men slapped a hand on Ken's shoulder.<br />
<br />
Yet the sight there was something right out of the history books. Hanging by her wrists was the lady from the bar which the Guard had cuffed and taken away. She was now stripped naked and her feet with still cloven hooves just brushed the floor. She wiggled about her moaning sounds melting Ken's heart. <br />
<br />
Now it was quite plain to see what she was, was not what she came into the Casino as. Then she was a lovely woman, well dressed, but when Ken saw her first she was very drunk! Now it would seem she was paying some sort of price for her angered words back in the Casino. She'd won a booby prize true enough and it was hung even now about her hairy neck.<br />
<br />
Kicking her feet slowly she moaned as her head hung down almost touching her chest. Arms stretched upward were more like legs of some animal now. Her fingers like toes were gone and replaced by those cloven hooves. Yet she was strung up like a beast about to be skinned and slaughtered. Every part of her naked self was in some sort of intermediate state of change from human to that of some large breed of goat. <br />
<br />
Ken's stance and stare might have alerted the men or at least one of them that he was not part of the company and might just be some jerk wandering down from the bar. <br />
<br />
Asking Ken if he was upset by the changling, Ken turned and mustering his best dull look then smiled. It made the man take his hand away and the others to come forward as if ready for orders.<br />
<br />
A quick searching look around ken saw a clipboard setting on the table next to several seringes filled with different colored juices. <br />
<br />
Ken asked to see the clipboard and flipping from one page to another asked when the subject would be ready to move on?<br />
<br />
One of the men turned and looked at the poor woman her body having changed far enough that hardly she could have been recognized as ever being human. He walked up to her, turning her as she hung there making note of the increased thigh muscle growth and a note of her up curved tail.<br />
<br />
Indeed Ken's wonders were satisfied as whateven happened to cause this change of the lady to a animal form was well past the point of no return. He didn't have any way to stop what was happening, least of all able to order the men and have her change somehow back to being a total woman.     <br />
<br />
The clipboard told of others who'd come before her and there cell numbers noted as once they finalized a point of disposition was already ordered.<br />
<br />
Ken looked at the clipboard reading as he pondered his next move and what to say or ask. In front of him the pages each had the human names, dates of birth, gender, height, weight, and color of eyes. Then Ken realized that the basic information had come from the person's drivers licenses. It gave even the home address and if married or single. <br />
<br />
Pricilla Anne Compton was the woman now rapidly becoming a goat.<br />
<br />
Before her was Allen Van Andle who was also on his way to be a Texas Long Horn Bull.<br />
<br />
Sally Maye Johnson, Fred W. Barnes, Timothy Viceroy Manter, Kevin Kenneth Koons, and the list went on and on for a couple dozen pages. Each one of those persons taken from the world above and dragged down to this hell hole. Then they were by some means changed from the human they were to animals that Pleasure Island needed or would sell. <br />
<br />
Ken paged down the list till his eyes stopped at the sight. David, Jeff, Ben, their names noted together as if brothers. Their disposition to be transported to a Mule stud and kept there as young verile male donkeys. <br />
<br />
The one man asking if Ken saw a name of someone he knew? It stopped Ken's reading and turned him to ask of the three donkeys. Wondering if the three were preped enough to remember what they were, like if they might know what they had become?<br />
<br />
One man looked to the other as they started to laugh. Ken felt as if he'd asked a foolish question and maybe given away his real idenity.<br />
<br />
Told then that the young men made donkeys would for the first few days or maybe a week remember their real selves. Yet with the sensation of bestial sex and mating the instinctive drives would wipe clean their thought process leaving them as common sex minded male Jackasses!<br />
<br />
Ken shuddered at the thought of his new found friends ending their young lives as dumb beasts used only for the sexual wants of mares and the lusty profits of Pleasure Island.</p>
