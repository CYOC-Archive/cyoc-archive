<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After cheering for the success of his amazing new power, he finally started to feel the copious amounts of jizz dripped down from his chin. He had been so focused on the fact that it even worked to realize that he just coated his entire neck and jaw in cum. &quot;Well, this is both disgusting and amazing, however now I am uncomfortable&quot; he groaned as he began wiping off his cum. He did sneak a taste out of curiosity, and while it tasted better than he thought it would, it wasn&#39;t that great, but that really didn&#39;t matter as he doubted he would be eating a lot of his cum any time soon.<br />
<br />
However, maybe he should try to &quot;prevent&quot; that from even happening, but how? That was when he had an amazing idea. Seahorses. The males are the ones who get pregnant, which means it shouldn&#39;t be that messy right? So he made a more creative edit, based on that concept. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans reproduce in a similar way as seahorses in which the males are the ones who get pregnant. The females deposite their eggs into the male&#39;s body, through their penis. The male sticks his penis inside the female, creating a tight seal, locking the both of them together, until he has become pregnant. This process is called sexual fusion, or sefu. This can take anywhere from several minutes up to several days, although there is not a set maximum duration. The current record for longest sefu is just over 3 months and 11 days. <br />
<br />
Durring sefu, the male and female nervous systems link up through their sexual organs, allowing them to share their senses, including even their sight and hearing. When the female cums, she floods the male penis with thousands of eggs, which then get forced down the penis and into the testicles, where they will possibly become fertilized. However, pregnancy is not guarenteed every time a female orgasms into a penis. If the male does not get pregnant an hour after receiving the eggs, the eggs will be passed through his body and into his colon, where they will get discharged out through the anus. <br />
<br />
Pregnancy is determined exclusively by the male. If he chooses to become pregnant, he will, else the pair will remain in a state of permanent sefu until either death or pregnancy. The one exception is if either member becomes sterile, sefu immediately ends. <br />
<br />
If a pair stay in sefu for a long enough period, they will slowly start to function as if they were a single organism. Both bodys will start to move cooperatively without thinking, and their minds will bleed into one another until they link up as well, making any thought now a shared thought. Studies have shown that after becomming &quot;merged&quot;, couples show a reluctance towards seperating for extended periods of time, as it now feels like a part of their body is missing. Some even have claimed to experience sensations akin to phantom limb syndrome which amputees often deal with. Another side effect is a partial loss of individuality. Victims of this tend to struggle with thinking unless their other half is their to finish the sentance with them. Both will be in perfect sync and have great effeciency when they are physically near by each other. But will become completely useless when seperated for more than a few minutes, falling into an almost brain dead stupor. This side effect can possibly be permanent if left unaddressed, however it is incredibly rare for sefu to even last that long, as nowadays, medical science progressed enough where it has created various ways to forcably but safely and painlessly seperate couples engaged in either unwanted, or regretted sefu.&quot;<br />

He set down the pencil and looked at his cock, noticing how his urethra now was significantly wider, around the diameter of a quarter. His balls also felt wierdly empty, like they were just 2 empty shells, which wasn&#39;t all that inaccurate, as his cum was now made somewhere else and now just was stored as a fluid in his scrotum, sourounding his 2 egg-shaped &quot;wombs&quot;. Only once his &quot;wombs&quot; were flooded with eggs, would the shell temporarily become porous allowing his semen to fertilize the eggs. After which it would harden and begin to grow as the offspring slowly grew inside. Once the fertalized eggs were just about the size of a baseball, they would be ejected back out of his cock, and would hatch. Giving birth would be very pleasurable too, at least he hoped it would be, as he absentmindedly began rubbing his finger around the rim of his urethra, savoring the subtle pleasure it brought him. Looking back at the tv, he now say on a comercial, that a pregnant man had absolutely huge balls, each of which were easily over 4 feet across and were set down on the floor beneath him as they were bigger than his own legs were tall. He was even using them as a foot rest, and so was his co-host, who had put her own high heeled feet up onto his left one, her psuedopenis was slowly making its way out from under her rather short pencil skirt too, which aparently no one seemed to even care about. <br />
<br />
He cared though, as he felt something deep in his balls stir, as a longing to be filled with a girl&#39;s eggs was slowly being developed. But before any of that, he wanted to finish his planned changes first.</p>
