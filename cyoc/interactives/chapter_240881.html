<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhat reluctantly, Amy reached out and took the half-empty can from her friend. She hefted it in her hand, glancing once more at the cartoon clown on its surface. As a little girl, Amy was afraid of clowns; she got over it but now she thought they were pathetic. She lifted it to her lips and took a sip.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened at the taste before they rolled upward, her lids fluttering at its strength. Without even thinking about it, the can was back at her mouth and she was downing it with deep gulps. The carbonation slid down her throat, pooling in her stomach before bubbling outward. Amy threw her free arm out against the soda machine, steadying herself while the bubbly sensations traveled down to the ends of her fingers and toes.<br />
<br />
Lina smiled at her friend&#39;s obvious enjoyment of the soda. What felt like a simple grin to her was displayed wide lips stretching from ear to ear, a deep happy red coloration overtook them. She ran her tongue across them absentmindedly, echoes of the circusesque soda flavor playing across her tastebuds.<br />
<br />
Lina shivered slightly as a wave of vertigo passed briefly over her. Her vision blurred as her clothes felt tight in various places. Lina swayed, scrunching her toes in shoes that now felt a size too small. She hiccupped quite loudly and her body pressed out again, , her body growing thicker and firmer.<br />
<br />
Lina brought a hand tipped with red nails to her lips, her face whitening in embarrassment at the noise she had made. The whitening didn&#39;t seem to be stopping though, the color steadily drained from her face before traveling downward. Her skin took on a uniformly white hue, looking as if she hadn&#39;t been in direct sunlight for the better part of a decade. Blemishes disappeared as her skin became wholly smooth, save for her cheeks which became a rosy red and filled with three black dots, freckles in each. A small red circle then appeared on each end of her mouth.<br />
<br />
Pale fingers still pressed firmly against her mouth; Lina felt another hiccup wrack her body. Despite holding it in her stomach stretched out, more vigorously than before. Her stomach stretched out, showing a noticeable pot belly. The clownifying girl moaned slightly behind her fingers, half in pleasure and half in discomfort as her swelling frame pressed against her clothes.<br />
<br />
Her breasts enlarged from A-Cups to hefty Cs, resting over her expanding stomach and swelling against her now too-small t-shirt as her bra disappeared. Her ass bubbled outward, the seams of her shorts creaking as they struggled to contain her milky cheeks. She scrunched her toes again as she felt a rustling in her shoes. Her soles and arches stretched outward in size, and something was going on with her socks. Their fabric writhed about and between her toes as if it was alive, becoming softer. Despite herself she found she enjoyed the sensations very much.<br />
<br />
Amy had been lost in the flavors and sensations of the soda for a solid few minutes now. They receded for the moment, and her eyes shot open at the strange combination of sounds emanating from her friend. She looked over, and found her eyes popping even wider at the sight of her embiggened friend.<br />
<br />
From short and scrawny to voluptuous and plump, Amy hardly would have recognized her friend if not for her familiar (if paler) face, even with the wide red grin and rosy cheeks and black freckles. Even that was changing slightly now though, as Linas cheeker became rounder, showing her weight. As she looked on, Lina&#39;s eyebrows disappeared to be replaced by wide black arches on her forehead; her eyelashes darker and thicker while her eyelids became shaded with light blue. Amy noticed a red spot forming at the top of Lina&#39;s brown hair. Inky black tendrils writhed their way through her friend&#39;s locks, inching toward their tips.<br />
<br />
Lina hiccupped once more, and again she gained even more weight, becoming even fatter, and more voluptuous as more flesh was piled on.<br />
Amy found her eyes having to travel upward as she observed this latest round of changes, the taste of the Klownie Kola playing about her tongue forgotten as she stared with an open mouth at her friend.<br />
<br />
Lina&#39;s hair finished its transition into a deep, shiny fire-engine red color, yet even as Amy watched, it seemed to shrivel upwards. It shrank from its original, mid-back length while curling and thickening into a bushy afro just around her shoulders. Her bangs receded back even furth, up past her forehead until all that was left was a thick curly red horseshoe around a head that was otherwise completely bald.<br />
<br />
The rustling that Lina felt in her socks had continued, and she bit the corner of her red lip at the pleasurable sensation; half tickle, half foot-rub. The sensations began to travel upward, as her socks became even softer and rose above the edges of her shoes all the way up her knees. Their white coloration changed to pink, covered with as a pattern of white polka dots overtook the fabric.<br />
Her white converse high-tops were not spared, their color changed to yellow with red wing tips and heels. They next morphed into a pair of mayy-janes, displaying her new socks even more. Her laces shifted to a dark purple, the same color as her lips. The toes streched outward and expaned until they were nearly as wide and long as the end of a canoe paddle. Lina felt a tingling sensation in her feert, and she could tell they were stretching to fit her shoes.<br />
Lina let out a sigh of relief as her too tight shorts shifted, forming into a knee length skirt fluffed up with white petticoats,and revealing just enough of her shapely ass. Their color quickly darkened to blue with white polka-dots as well and trimmed with red lace. Her relief was broken with a quiet gasp as her plain panties shifted beneath them, the simple cotton shifting to yellow with red dots as they lengthened into baggy bloomers that reached her knees.<br />
The collar of her white t-shirt expanded into a mid-length lace collar. The arms un, and the color shifted to to match her new bloomers,the hem tucked itself into theat waist of her skirt. The shoulders s became poofy, while the sleeves stretched to Lina&#39;s wrists with white lace at the end.<br />
She gazed down at her white hands. Fingerless blue gloves with yellow palms formed, making her white fingers and ned nails stand out even more.<br />
She felt a pinch in each earlobe, and two gold hooped earrings appeared, giving Lina&#39;s new hairstyle a rather femine look despite her bald pate. They ought to have been painful, but instead felt more like the pleasurable pops of the Klownie Kola&#39;s carbonation still bouncing through her body. A brooch styled like a comedy mask appeared at her throat, and a tiny red derby sat on her white bald head at a jaunty angle. Lina gave another hiccup, and a final change happened, her nose became a perfect sphere, round, red, and nearly the size of a tennis ball, with nostrils underneath so she could breath comfortably.<br />
Lina breathed heavily as the changes slowed, and then finally stopped. She stood there, now gone was the mousey girl who entered the store, a plump, bubbly, silly whitefaced clown. Her nipples still buzzed underneath hershe now wore, her large breasts stood out over her protruding belly. Her feet almost ached pleasantly in her new clown shoes, her socks tight wrapped tightly around her larg soles. She scrunched her toes again, feeling sympathetic pleasure rippling beneath her bloomers.<br />
&quot;Hee-hee,&quot; she giggled then added in her new silly voice, &quot;I feel funny.&quot; She did not notice the irony of her words. Lina then took off her tinny little hat and rubbed her now smooth bald scalp; gingerly she touch her bulbous red clown nose.&quot;And that was only half a can?!&quot; She gave the organ in question a sqeeze. HONK!<br />
Amy still stood rooted to the spot, staring in shock and awe at her friend. Her whole concept of the world had just been shattered over the course of a few minutes.<br />
So distracted by her friend&#39;s changes had Amy been, that she hadn&#39;t noticed the resurgence of the soda&#39;s bubbling in her own stomach. It returned now, and Amy felt a tickling, expectant sensation in her throat. Before she could react, a loud hiccup erupted from her.</p>
