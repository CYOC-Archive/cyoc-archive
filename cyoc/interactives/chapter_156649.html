<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony couldn&#39;t believe the night he was having. He felt incredibly sexy and confident in his pony body and delighted in showing it off to whomever wanted to look. As it was, his molted pink and black cock was hard as a rock and drooling pre as it bobbed between his legs earning both shocked and appreciative looks from other movie goers as they exited the lobby. Once again he felt uneasy at the sight of the other pony boys tied up outside the theater, though he felt a distinct throb in his own cock as several of their members dropped and lengthened in response to seeing his. <br />
<br />
His best friend had the hots for him and wanted him more now than before he was a pony. He was eager to go further with Roger but knew he had to play it cool so he wouldn&#39;t get in trouble with Max, his dad, or the Pony Boy Commission. Roger carefully strapped his arms  down and hitched him up to the surrey for the run home. Every now and then their pace would slow if Tony became too focused on jiggling his ass for Roger and Roger was enjoying the show too much to give him a taste of the whip. <br />
<br />
Much too quickly for either of their tastes, they arrived back at Tony&#39;s house and Max met them in the yard. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how did it go? Did the pony give you any trouble?&quot; Max asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No trouble at all, we had a great time,&quot; Roger said, sneaking a wink to Tony as he stroked his mane down the side of his neck. <br />
<br />
Roger moved to take off the harness but Max stopped him, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s getting late. Why don&#39;t we give you a ride home.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment Roger hesitated. He could feel the warm damp spot in his boxers from the near continuous erection he had been sporting all night and he wanted some time to cool off before he got home. That and he wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted to let his family see his best friend like a pony. They had already made some derogatory comments about pony boys in general and since Tony received more changes quicker than expected thanks to the breader mix-up, he didn&#39;t want to know how they would react to that. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I wouldn&#39;t want to tire Tony out with that much running since we already went to the theater and back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, he can take it. He&#39;s going to have to get used to running this much anyway.&quot; Max said.<br />
<br />
Tony was edging closer to Roger and attempting to nuzzle up against him, &quot;Yeah, don&#39;t worry about me. I can take whatever you want to give me Roger,&quot; Tony added with a grin.<br />
<br />
Max lightly swatted Tony&#39;s ass, &quot;Don&#39;t get smart,&quot; he chided as he climbed into the surrey.<br />
<br />
Roger just shrugged and climbed back in.<br />
<br />
It was just a few blocks to Roger&#39;s house and while Max kept up a steady stream of questions about the movie which Roger was forced to answer in vague terms since he actually saw very little of the film and was still too entranced by the gentle swaying of Tony&#39;s tail. They rounded the corner onto his street and Roger&#39;s blood chilled. His older brother was in the front drive working on his car, appropriately enough, a mustang. <br />
<br />
Roger&#39;s oldest brother Adam was a total tool. Since he attended the local university he still lived at home despite being twenty-two and Roger dreamed of the day the bully would move out. A muscle bound jock with more brawn than brains, how he was managing to pass his college classes was a mystery to Roger but h suspected he had help from the wrestling program in order to keep him eligible to compete. Adam had more to say than most on almost every subject, and lately that included gays and pony boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t the neighborhood freak,&quot; Adam said with a laugh upon hearing the clomping of Tony&#39;s feet pulling up to the curb, &quot;and his friend the pony home with him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger sneered at him, &quot;Shut up Adam, don&#39;t you need to go play with your dumbbells?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I, you weren&#39;t home,&quot; Adam retorted while flexing a bit to show off his muscles under he sleeveless tank top, &quot;besides I think I can afford to take a break, don&#39;t you agree horsey?&quot; he said to Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt  you ever take a break, from being stupid that is,&quot; Tony laughed before Max flicked his whip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it pony, he may be rude but that is still a human you are talking to,&quot; Max corrected him.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like an ass,&quot; Tony mumbled under his breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;God look at this thing, it&#39;s even worse than I thought.&quot; Adam said ignoring both Max and Tony&#39;s comments as he moved in close to look the pony over. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s bad enough that they let fucking pervs out in public like this as punishment, but I can&#39;t believe some homos actually volunteer to become these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind your own damn business, Adam.&quot; Roger  grumbled as he climbed out of the surrey. <br />
<br />
Adam walked right up to Tony and ran his grease covered fingers through Tony&#39;s mane and down his back only pausing to give a not so subtle yank to Tony&#39;s tail. Tony startled a little at this but did his best to stay calm since his master was still holding his reigns in the surrey. Adam even reached under him and tugged on his ball weights painfully and gave his long shaft a squeeze. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhg, the fag even had his dick all horsed up. Gross!&quot; he spat in the grass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I didn&#39;t give you permission to touch my pony like that,&quot; Max protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine Max, I suspect he&#39;s just jealous,&quot; Tony almost growled before driving his knee into Adam&#39;s groin.<br />
<br />
Adam dropped to the sidewalk and spouted a steady stream of swears directed at that &quot;queer ass freak&quot; While Roger tried to stand between the two of them to prevent any further contact even though both his brother and now Tony were much more massively muscled than he was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you two had better go,&quot; he suggested, &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, ok.&quot; Max said<br />
<br />
Tony desperately wanted to stretch out and kiss Roger goodbye, but his master had already cracked the whip and he had no choice but to gallop off. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know I should punish you for that,&quot; Max chided him on the way home, &quot;but he really did have it coming.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tony just nodded and silently ran onward, his mind racing about Roger and his dumb older brother. <br />
<br />
In no time they arrived at home and Max unhitched Tony but made him put everything away. Max then spent a good amount of time cleaning and grooming Tony which he surprisingly enjoyed, especially the attention Max seemed to be paying to Tony&#39;s forever throbbing cock before their dad appeared on the back porch and called them in. <br />
<br />
Tony went up to his room and quickly got to work on his need for release, relishing in the sensation of having both his hands sliding up and down his rigid pole and imaging those hands to be Roger&#39;s and Max&#39;s before blasting a massive load that the ceiling before cascading back down over his face and chest. <br />
<br />
He cleaned up a little and then sat down in front of the Chronivac before turning his thoughts to Adam.</p>
