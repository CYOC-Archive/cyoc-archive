<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimmy J.R ripped open the present faster that it took to wrap; the paper hiding a fantasy style Lego set. A set showing a knight approaching a dragon defending it’s horde; Alison smiled knowing that her cub was pleased to see the set. She knew Jimmy looked forward to building the set with his father; she just wished his excitement was geared more towards the science experiment kit as well as the telescope he got.<br />
“The dragon will fight to keep it’s treasure safe,” Jimmy roared with glee as he put down the box; the cougar cub noticed his cat Dickens pawing the scattered wrapping paper. He was curious as to what got the cat to approach the chaos when the presents began to be opened up. Then it happened; faster than anyone could act, Dickens coiled then launch himself into the pile of torn wrapping paper. Burying himself in the mess and quickly running out afterwards. <br />
“Silly cat,” Jimmy S.R. chuckling as the commotion got him out of examining the crossword puzzle book; getting it from his twin brother Jake. Putting it down he opens up another present; his cervine ears twitch as he lifts up the power drill inside the box.<br />
“Shall I drill down to the issue,” Jimmy S.R holding up the new power tool to add to his growing collection for some springtime home improvement projects.<br />
<br />
“Open my next,” was all Alison said; she thought of many ways to tell her mate the news he was soon to receive. One thought was to wrap her pregnant belly with a large ribbon tied into a bow; having Jimmy undo it to show the sonogram he was about to see. Another was to drop it on him on some evening playtime that had to change thanks to her pregnant condition. Instead she thought giving it to him as a Christmas present would be the best method.<br />
“Oh my,” Jimmy putting the picture down; he looks up and stares at Alison. His lip quivering as happy tears come from his eyes. “Is this true?”<br />
“Don’t tell me you bought your brother’s gas lighting you into thinking I’m having twins,” Alison looking at her anthro stag-deer mate; having that same nonsense playfully being tossed her way by her friend Brittany. It was the first sonogram that conclusively showed only one developing fetus. The picture that Jimmy put down showed the gender; Alison was carrying his second son. However this sonogram showed the developing of hooves and the muzzle looking deer like instead of the feline snout that she and Jimmy J.R have.<br />
“Now you can stop lamenting how the Proudhood family is going feline,” Alison sticking out her tongue in a mocking way; this just made Jimmy S.R hugging Alison. Jimmy J.R seeing what is happening decides to join in, turning the embracing into a group hug.<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
News went out fast once Jimmy got the news that Alison’s second cub was a boy and a deer fury. Edward and Julian’s phones exploding as the anthro deer wanted to break the news. This broke the Heartpaws away from watching Adam as he examines the Lincoln Log set he got from his older sister Alison. The anthro cougar cub ripping open a second present as his parents are currently video chatting with Alison and Jimmy. The male fox and female cougar fury couple offering congratulations as they feel a tug on their tails. Both turning to see Adam looking at them as he is holding up the same Lego set as his older nephew Jimmy J.R got.<br />
“Looks like you are going to need help putting that together,” Edward turning his attention to his son; you want to do that later today or have fun outside?”<br />
“Can’t we do both,” Adam looking at his dad; his mother putting the phone away as she turns back to her son.<br />
“Save the Lego for tomorrow,” Julian placing a paw on her son’s furry head; “your father promised you an afternoon of racing down a hill in an inner tube.”<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
Brittany looked at the mess her twins made as the ripped open their presents; the remnants of wrapping paper as they busily examined their haul. Her son dusk, a charcoal grey furred anthro wolf cub was eager to play with the remote controlled drone he got. Brittany’s daughter dawn, an anthro doe-deer fury was already opening the box containing an oddly shaped lamp. Reading the box slowly, she spoke out the words lava lamp. Looking up at her mother, Brittany explained that the bulb at the base heats up the wax in the container. The heated and melted wax being less dense than the fluid it was in will float before cooling and sinking back to the bottom; only for the cycle to repeat itself. The warning on the box not to touch the glass when turned on could not be overstated enough. Another curious present was a detangling brush for Dusk’s thick shaggy fur and the knots that sometime accumulate; Dawn’s fur was short and coarse like her father’s and had a fine soft bristle brush to help keep it smooth and free of dirt. Both also received various school supplies, books, pencils, crayons and the sort; they also got candy.<br />
<br />
Jake opened up a present and got a mystery novel, along with a bottle of fifteen year old scotch. The anthro stag-deer fury smiled when he unwrapped an immersion blender; a kitchen appliance to help quickly make sauces, drinks and other items. “This will work great for a puree I have been wanting to make,” he remarks as he puts down the gift. He was about to open up his brother’s when his phone gets a text; pausing to see that the message was from his brother. Jake just sighs as he hands the device to Brittany and rolls his eyes. Seeing the text that it’s a boy and a deer fury followed by a grainy picture of the sonogram Alison gave him.<br />
“I know we teased Alison about her having twins, but she could have helped torment Jimmy with it at least for a bit.”<br />
“I tried,” Brittany handing the phone back to Jake; “but she wasn’t interested. She thought it was too cruel of a prank and would add unnecessary stress. Be sure to text your congratulations,” Alison checking her phone before putting it away.<br />
“I will,” Jake opening his present from Jimmy; the deer fury fury chuckles as it was a book of word search puzzles; “funny brother, as I got you a crossword puzzle book.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Lucas and Rachael Soulfang already look exhausted as their twin wolf cubs, Oliver and Paul were running up and down the house playing with the airplane toys they just unwrapped. While it was not the only tows the white furred wolf cubs got, it was one they could easily make silly noises as they ran around pretending to be pilots. While the couple each got gift certificates to their favorite spa; the wolf and lioness couple figured it would take more than a few relaxing massages to recover from the chaos their cubs are reveling in. Christmas was clearly a hit for the two as they savaged each present; ripping off the paper and lighting up as they tried to immediately play with the latest toy. Only to be side tracked as another present came their way.<br />
<br />
While they did like the gift certificates, Lucas and Rachael did get other gifts. Lucas received a few electronic gadgets; one of them was a door bell camera that he wanted to get. Another gadget was a digital thermostat; Lucas smiled as the device could be controlled by his phone thanks to an app. Rachael had gotten a new coffee machine as she killed the previous one. The new coffee machine could make more than just a simple cup of coffee; the prospect of making a cappuccino or and espresso was something the anthro lioness fury was twitching her tail in anticipation.<br />
<br />
“You think we went overboard with the presents,” Rachael sighing as she begins to gather the torn wrapping paper into a pile for disposal.<br />
“Look at our cubs,” Lucas motioning to the twins as they still run around enjoying some of their new toys; “you think they are going overboard with the fun they are having?”<br />
“No,” Rachael shaking her head; “but they can’t sustain that activity for long. All that energy spent…”<br />
“Means they will have a nap giving us a chance at a rare afternoon delight,” Lucas seductively growling as he gets up and embraces his mate from behind. Rachael feeling his lupine penis poking her as he hugs her; his fury hand paws traveling up and down her tawny fur, while he playfully nibbles on one of her ears.<br />
“Oh how original,” Rachael already feeling aroused at her mate’s advances; “but let’s at least try and wait until after Oliver and Paul conk out for a nap.”</p>
