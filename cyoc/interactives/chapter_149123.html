<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter is what happens if the story ends here and Jen never finds her bits. Not to worry, the other branch will continue it, but I have some ideas that require some time to pass.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, feel free to continue this chapter if you want, but I probably won&#39;t. This ended up more positive than I had intended starting out to be honest.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">30-year old Jennifer Smith woke up to the sound of her alarm with a smile on her face. Today was a big day for her, and she was excited but a bit nervous, hoping she was the right fit for her new job. She checked her phone and went through all the text messages of her friends wishing her good luck. After high school, Jen&#39;s attitude had mellowed out and many of her friends today would have been people she&#39;d picked on, had they gone to Glendale back when she was there. If you had asked them what they thought of Jen, they&#39;d tell you about how she was always serene even in chaotic situations, and how she always seemed like she was enjoying life, being a beacon of positivity during stressful negotiations or meetings. As her coworker Emile once said, &quot;Some of the people here seem like they have a stick up their ass, but Jen always has something nice to say. I&#39;d think she was high on something, if not for how sharp she is.&quot; They secretly suspected she was les though, or perhaps even aesexual, for multiple reasons, but mainly because she&#39;d always turned down attempts to ask her out despite always being flattered at the request.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t even counting all the former victims Jen had reached out to in the years since and apologized to. Brad had been flying around the country in the NFL, unfortunately, but most of her other former classmates had made amends. Some of the congratulatory messages she&#39;d received had been from the very people she&#39;d mistreated back then, bringing tears to her eyes at the depth of their forgiveness. <i>They&#39;re all hoping I succeed....wish me luck too, okay?</i> Jen clenched the penis sitting inert inside her, her thoughts drifting to her long-time companion. As she sat on the toilet and began her morning routine, she reflected on her long journey to this day.<br />
<br />
She had never located her wayward pussy, and when she moved from the Midwest to UCLA for college, she had given up hope, realizing that her genitals would be anonymous sex toys for the rest of her life in all likelihood. On the verge of a nervous breakdown during her first semester as she got double-penetrated in her dorm room, she realized that her powerlessness to control when she had sex freed her to enjoy it as much as she could when it happened, and it had proved the catalyst for her self-improvement as she came again and again that night. By the end of college, she had completely transformed from her bitchy, bullying self, and in her place was a kind, easy-going but hard-working journalism major (that secretly had sex numerous times a day in public). While she sat at the bar comforting her friend over her recent breakup, she almost felt lucky for her curse, feeling her unknown lover take her in the ass while she sipped her beer and listened. Still, the fact that she only had her mouth left kept her from ever entering relationships during college, and focusing almost entirely on her studies, she graduated summa cum laude.<br />
<br />
Kyle had even apologized to her a few years ago, having matured a bit himself. He had prostrated himself before her and reminded her that she had the curse, but pleaded that Jennifer not use it until he showed her something. On the way to his house, he explained how he had come to realize that what he had done to his victims went far beyond the pain he had received, and he saw the monster he was whenever he looked in his mirror.<br />
<br />
It was especially apparent when he looked down and saw Susan&#39;s tight asian pussy wrapped around his member, as her hurt eyes simultaneously looked at him from across the room. Turning to Jennifer as she took this all in with a disgusted look while sitting on Kyle&#39;s bed, he told her &quot;I know it&#39;s wrong, but when it&#39;s just sitting there...I just can&#39;t stop!&quot; Tears began to run down Kyle&#39;s face as he told Jen that despite the level of disgust he felt towards <i>himself,</i> the pleasure was too great for him to stop using Susan&#39;s holes every day as he went about his life, and the guilt was eating him alive. He had stopped putting her mouth and face in his drawer except when his guilt became too much, and at night he had started conversing with her. Speaking through her backwards mouth that first night, Susan had told Kyle (after bitching him out for stealing her life over a full half-hour) that while she didn&#39;t forgive him for turning her into his inanimate sex slave, she was honestly sorry for the bullying he had done beforehand. She felt her own remorse over how she might be whole today had she never used him as her favorite social pariah. Their relationship was rocky to say the least, and many a night she had cursed at him and called him weak through his cabinet, after he had put her away to assuage his conscience while he furiously jerked off in her vagina. But Susan had her sanity even after 5 years of being Kyle&#39;s living cocksleeves, and Kyle at least had long-since developed feelings for her. <br />
<br />
And so when he had heard that Jen, the current curse-holder, had finally returned after earning her degree, he knew he <b>had</b> to track her down to try and fix as much as he could. &quot;I understand if you want to curse me, god knows I deserve it. But I&#39;m begging you, PLEASE use the curse on Susan instead to turn her back. You might not remember her, but she was your best friend once. She doesn&#39;t deserve this.&quot; Dismissing Kyle and Susan, Jennifer thought for a long time in Kyle&#39;s room about the pivotal decision she was about to make. She had three choices; She could dare Susan or Kyle to transform her back, transform Susan back herself, or take her revenge on Kyle. Regardless of which she picked, there was no guarantee that she would get another turn as she didn&#39;t know Susan and certainly didn&#39;t trust Kyle. Walking into the living room where Kyle sat quietly and Susan was arranged on the table, Jennifer looked down on Kyle with a steely glare as he looked back in fear.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan, transform or dare?&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
Staying quiet for the requisite minute, Jennifer gave Susan her body back as she stretched her arms and legs for the first time in years. &quot;Thank you Jen, I know you don&#39;t remember me but I remember you. You&#39;ve grown up, and not just physically.&quot; But over the next few minutes, Jennifer&#39;s prior memories of Susan slowly returned. Unfortunately, the curse threw them a curve-ball; Because Susan had actually spent the last half-decade in Kyle&#39;s pants, her history was re-written to include her dropping out of college and she was curently a fast-food worker in Milwaukee. As Susan&#39;s new memories overlapped with the actual events, Susan expression became increasingly exasperated &quot;Being a wage slave isn&#39;t much better than being a sex slave. My family practically disowned me; I haven&#39;t talked to them in years in this timeline either. Is there anything the dare can do to help?&quot; Jen once again went to Kyle&#39;s room to consider a set of significant words. <i>What one dare could rewrite how far removed she is from her life?</i> Besides that, she felt a special kinship with Susan as they had both been affected (or were affected) by the curse, and Jen wanted a dare that gave them an easy excuse for them to remain close. Walking back into the living room, Jen told Susan &quot;I dare you...Susan Zhou, I dare you to be my adopted sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking into her living room after getting dressed (not bothering with underwear since there was nothing to hide), she came upon Susan sitting in their reclining chair,  stretching a pair of bikini bottoms over a very realistic-looking dildo over and over. &quot;Gooood morrrrning...&quot; she moaned as Jennifer looked at her with mock disdain. &quot;Susan Smith! Getting your rocks off without me?&quot; Her petite form was dominated by two large nubs. Not the result of the curse; Susan just naturally had a small chest (though Jen didn&#39;t often remind her of it) and large nipples. Slowly down for a moment, Susan looked at her feigning insult &quot;I was just being <i>considerate</i> Jen! I wanted you to get enough sleep for today, so I got out of bed without waking you. Besides, you get your rocks off without me <i>all</i> the time.&quot; Jennifer laughed at her retort, &quot;Yep, you&#39;ve got me there! But at least I keep it in my pants rather than on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The curse had not, and according to Kyle, <i>could not</i> entirely reverse. They would never again have completely normal bodies, and while Susan had her body back, her vagina would always relocate to the outside of whatever clothes she wore, and remain on that piece of clothing until she put on something else. The curse always made bodily changes seem normal to outsiders though, and Susan had gotten a job as a fashion model. Walking the runway with all manner of outfits, her lower lips were bared for all to see on the front of her dress or bottoms every time. Everyone else saw it as a mundane event, but it turned Susan on every time she walked out to the cameras flashing, her hole dripping onto the thousand-dollar outfits as she seductively fingered herself as she posed. Another one of her favorites was to masturbate as she walked down the street, passerby not paying it any more attention then if she were tapping her feet so long as she kept her face straight. Her mouth and anus were also affected, but like Jen&#39;s ass, only if she began thinking about her other orifices sexually. That had come in handy when she had lent Kyle her mouth on a handkerchief for a few days while she headed up to New York for a show, everyone there taking her smooth lower face and full cheeks with complete nonchalance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet Kyle is enjoying the ride?&quot; Jennifer said as she watched Susan continue to go at it with the disembodied cock. &quot;Maybe, he&#39;s giving it so I&#39;m not sure.&quot; Susan replied, her grin becoming even more maniacal as she picked up the pace. Following Jennifer&#39;s dare, Susan had subjected Kyle to some of the same changes they had gone through. &quot;You must have shot some of that cum into my brain, because while I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this after what you did, I guess I do forgive you. I forgive you Kyle Wiskowski, and honestly after being a passenger in your life and watching you for as long as I have, I feel something for you too...&quot; Kyle stood in shock, and a warm smile started to emerge on his face. But as he moved in to kiss Susan, his heart thumping in his chest, Susan viciously pushed him back onto his couch. &quot;-but you still need to be punished!&quot; Kyle worked as an IT professional in town, but his dick sans balls were kept with Susan 24/7, and for a few years afterwards Kyle&#39;s ass worked overtime at a variety of gay bars around the country wherever Susan happened to be for a fashion show. Like Jennifer&#39;s & Susan&#39;s parts, Kyle&#39;s were forever immune to any sort of infection and bathroom needs. It also never loosened, staying as tight as the day the curse took hold. <i>Unlike</i> Jennifer&#39;s parts, Susan always knew where Kyle&#39;s were as part of the transformation, not only solidifying her hold on her lover&#39;s parts but also allowing her to safely retrieve them after leaving them in a public venue. Now though, Susan kept both of his parts after deeming his repentance complete, and he came by pretty often. Even when he didn&#39;t, Kyle still came pretty often.<br />
<br />
<i>But if Kyle&#39;s riding Kyle, who&#39;s Susan riding?</i> Susan correctly guessed at Jen&#39;s perplexed expression as she said &quot;You&#39;re forgetting our newest roommate! Well, partial roommate for now.&quot; Her eyes rolled back once more in her head as she lifted her butt off the seat to reveal Martha&#39;s face. They had just managed to track her down last month, and she had been much less repentant than Kyle until Susan had popped the big question. Begging for mercy as she realized she was about to get paid back with interest, she had run out of time and received both. She would have fainted as she heard her transformation if not for the curse rooting her in place until Susan was done. &quot;-and for your dare, I dare you to make Jen&#39;s tongue as sensitive as her clit, and to feel bad about what you did!&quot; &quot;What...?&quot; Martha <i>and</i> Jen had both said, before Martha gave her her transformation and Jen felt a growing pleasure from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you could try her, she&#39;s <i>so</i> good at eating my ass.&quot; Susan said as she began to sit back down. &quot;Wait! I&#39;m sorry! I totally went overboard with my revenge, I&#39;ll tell you where-MMmphhh!&quot; Martha&#39;s tongue snaked up into Susan&#39;s backside automatically as she settled in with a sigh. Jennifer walked up to the chair and began playing with one of the breasts mounted on the armrests. &quot;Yes, you did. And that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to keep you this way for another 11 months.&quot; As Martha&#39;s eyes looked at Jen pleadingly from beyond the cleft of Susan&#39;s tight tush, Jennifer guessed as to what was bothering her. &quot;Oh yeah, you get used to the fucking, trust me. Give it a few months and getting it in both holes will feel as natural as sneezing. I mean, it was easier for me since I got used to one before the other, but <i>that&#39;s</i> why it&#39;s a punishment.&quot; For Martha&#39;s transformation, she was reduced to her face, breasts, vagina, and her whole ass, looking much like the bronze relief of Jennifer&#39;s. De-aged to be as much younger as she had been older than Jen & Susan, the 18-again former maid had had her face and breasts put onto their living room chair, where Susan spent nearly all her time when home, and her nether parts loaned to two very popular brothels in Brazil and the Czech Republic. <i>Her....pussy is in Rio and her ass is in Karlovy. Or was it the other way around?</i> thought Jen.<br />
<br />
Martha, unable to shake her head, made more sounds that vibrated up Susan&#39;s rectum. &quot;Oh yeah, keep doing that Martha. And the tongue roll, oooh!&quot; Susan cried out. Jennifer smiled icily at Martha as some of her old self began to emerge &quot;Oh, you mean <i>my</i> parts? That&#39;s adorable, don&#39;t you realize I could have gotten them back <i>years ago</i> by now? The fat ass sitting on you-&quot; (&quot;Hey!&quot; Susan said with a huff) &quot;-has the curse right now, she could use it to transport my vagina and asshole back to me just like she did my nipples.&quot; Jennifer had gotten her nipples back three years ago, as a certain bronze trophy had lost one of it&#39;s defining features. With Jennifer&#39;s newly-sensitive tongue, she had wanted something of her own to lick with it when she wasn&#39;t french-kissing Susan or lazily sucking Kyle during the weekend. &quot;But after all this time, why mess up what&#39;s going well? My life after high school has been everything I could have ever asked for: I have a life partner who loves me. The person who cursed me made amends, hell he sat down with us for Thanksgiving dinner last year. My career just hit a new milestone today. Not to mention, I never have to look for a hook-up or deal with the dating scene, you have no <i>idea</i> how much time I save on that alone. You might have been too severe in your vengeance, but it completely backfired.&quot; It was hard to tell for someone whose face was mostly occluded by a Chinese girl&#39;s buttocks, but Jen thought Martha looked positively astonished by her revelation, despite it being so obvious to her. &quot;We were all dumb barely-adults back then. But you? You were thirty, getting petty revenge by fucking up a high-schooler&#39;s life.&quot; Jen paused for a moment to calm down before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, if I find out who&#39;s had my pussy and ass this whole time, there&#39;s <i>no way</i> they&#39;ll ever live up to what I built them up as in my mind. My whole mentality today is based off of what happened in college. That was the height of your revenge, as I was seriously considering suicide at the thought of getting used like a toy every day for the rest of my life. But in the depths of despair, on the verge of breaking, I had a realization. The fact that I couldn&#39;t even control when I fucked taught me to stop trying to control everything and everyone in life, stop trying to control what I can&#39;t control, and, well...&quot; Jennifer blushed &quot;...just accept people as they come. Or cum, you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I accepted my condition, which you had forced on me, and because of that I started to have more fun with it. I began to re-frame myself as being the luckiest girl in the world, because I had two lovers giving me pleasure 24/7, that I could always have a quick orgasm even in line to the restroom or studying during finals week. It turned my whole life around. No, I&#39;m satisfied with my parts being how they are now. I get to have a great sex life no matter how busy I am with the rest of my life, and they get to bang my holes whenever they want....I don&#39;t think I ever <i>want</i> to meet the two people who have them, it would ruin the fantasy. Probably, anyway.&quot; Even if she wasn&#39;t currently performing analingus on Susan, Martha would have been speechless as she turned and walked towards the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of that Jen, how have your two &#39;lovers&#39; been treating you lately?&quot; Susan said with a Cheshire smile as Jen prepared breakfast. &quot;Well, I actually didn&#39;t have sex last night. It&#39;s almost like they gave me a break so I could prepare for today, nice of them actually. But my <i>ass,</i> oh my god it&#39;s like whoever&#39;s getting in there always has SO much energy! I&#39;m pretty sure someone&#39;s running trains on it, it usually only happens in the morning and evening, but it&#39;s at least 10 people each time.&quot; Jennifer looked down at herself. &quot;Still, I appreciate the rest but I&#39;m a little on-edge for tonight, and I could use some <i>tension relief.</i>&quot; Jennifer poked her lower torso and internally squeezed the lover in her front hole, trying to wake him up. &quot;I might ask you to zap my pussy back here just so I can put it in the men&#39;s room at work. Some of those guys look so stressed! Especially if <i>someone</i> doesn&#39;t start fucking me more in the morning!&quot; As she felt her sex tunnel begin to fill, she sank into her dining room chair. &quot;<i>Oooh yeahhhh</i>, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about...I&#39;m giving you a quota of eight times today...&quot; The 30-year old woman savored the first mouthful on her tongue at the same time as she savored the pounding of her still 18-year old pussy.<br />
<br />
From the living room, she heard Susan speak teasingly &quot;Come on Martha, you know you like it....&quot; Jen could almost see Susan&#39;s wink. &quot;I certainly do not! I&#39;m not like you sluts, just fucking in public! I will <i>never</i> enjoy what&#39;s being done to my-OMMMMH!&quot; &quot;My arms are tired, so suck a dick for a while, please.&quot; Martha blushed in shame, powerless but to begin creating suction around the 12-inch penis that had been dropped on the seat cushion and down her oscillating throat.<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned her attention back to her sausage, eggs, and sausage. <i>First comes denial...</i><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;ve got 4 options, Steve. Jamal or Lee could break through coverage when they slant, or you or Kendrick could run it, but you&#39;ve got to make a decision fast! The line is outnumbered so you don&#39;t have much time before the sack if you don&#39;t run it.&quot; As Brad explained the option offense once more to his players, he glanced at his watch. <i>Game&#39;s tomorrow, better give them more time tonight.</i> He called the practice done and watched his players trudge into the Glendale locker room.<br />
<br />
Brad had come back to Glendale after a short stint in the NFL, being a negative in the not-often-tracked stat of getting hitched while in the league. That had changed when he had come back as the head football coach, the youngest in school history. As he fell in love with a cute hostess at a local bar, he had begun to get rid of many of his childish things in preparation for commitment. Chief among those things, of course, was his &quot;consolation&quot; trophy. He had agonized over what to do with it; Even after what had happened between them, he couldn&#39;t bear to see Jen&#39;s face when he returned her anus to her, and on such a demeaning display. Yet, he couldn&#39;t just put it in his attic, as he could tell that Jen had come to love her daily ass-fuckings too, even as she would never guess as to the source. As he continued to thrust into her soft rectum yet again that night, the question of what to do with the trophy haunted him.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he had settled upon his current solution,though he cursed his cowardice for not being able to tell Jen the truth. Next year I&#39;ll tell her, he had kept saying to himself, even though he was already into the third year of the current setup. There was no denying it worked though, at least in combination with his fairly-clever mind for coaching; Glendale had gone from only a middling team after his departure to having only one loss in the past three years, and he had no doubt some of it was due to most unorthodox aspect of his team-building.<br />
<br />
In the back of a new locker room exclusive for varsity athletes, in a locker no one was ever assigned but all the players often used, sat a wooden block that had been sealed into the wall. None of the athletes would ever have any idea about the picture and plaque on the inner face, but they were all intimately familiar with the folds and flesh of the &quot;bronze lady&#39;s&quot; anus, as the players lined up to fuck her the night before every game (as well as after every game, before every practice, after every practice...). Brad had also told the coaches of Glendale&#39;s other sports. Almost all of them were old friends and upperclassmen from his time at Glendale, and literally all of them agreed to share in his method once the results became clear (some even used it regularly themselves to sharpen the mind). Hence, pretty much any time at least one teenage boy was in the locker room and horny, which was pretty much all the time year-around, the bronze lady&#39;s asshole was always available to &quot;train&quot; with. There was even a stand to watch porn on while you banged her, and it was shaped like tits.<br />
<br />
Nobody ever missed practice, and Brad never had to worry about what had happened to him senior year happening to his players. Every year he gave them the same spiel; that a former graduate, affected by the town curse, had decided to donate a piece of herself to her alma mater in the service of school spirit. It was a lie, of course, as hundreds of student athletes (and the student delinquents who occasionally broke in at night) took Jennifer anally each year with her remaining ignorant of her alumni duties all the while. But it made a weird kind of sense; Jennifer was kind of a slut, and Jennifer had been head cheerleader. So now Jennifer served class after class of Glendale athletes as their &quot;girlfriend&quot;, silently listening to their problems while they blew off steam by blowing their load into her.<br />
<br />
Still, his conscience slowly got the better of him, especially in his sober moments staring at the ceiling with his wife Tanya sleeping beside him. Deciding to finally release Jennifer&#39;s tight ring from it&#39;s bondage as school property, he had tried to get in contact with her. She hadn&#39;t returned any phonecalls (Brad had changed phone numbers many times since high school) or emails (Jennifer received thousands of emails from the public as part of her job), Brad had decided to change tact and contact someone who could let her know in person. Deciding to call her adopted sister, Brad braced himself for a long conversation.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh <i>really?</i> And your record is <i>what</i> now? Oh, okay we&#39;ll talk later. I&#39;ll let her know you called when the time is right, but she&#39;s got a lot on her plate right now. Yeah, I&#39;m sure Jen will be happy to hear from you, but talk to me again before you call her. Yeah, she&#39;s on tonight, bye.&quot; Susan hung up. <i>A lot on her plate, and a lot up her ass, haha. Surely Jen can do cheer for another year, right?</i><br />
<br />
Brad, meanwhile, thought to himself <i>Huh, guess this won&#39;t interfere with the season after all. She&#39;s on tonight, huh...</i> After a moment of internal deliberation, he ran to his team captain and told him to lock up after everyone, got in his truck, and headed home to see Jennifer be on TV in the big city. The irony that he was physically much closer to Jennifer on the field was lost on him.<br />
<br />

<br />
Steve paced back and forth. As his first night as assistant producer, the evening had been a logistical nightmare. Two people had called in sick, another one fell off a ladder, and now the script needed to be reprinted. They were scheduled to go on in a little more than five minutes and the atmosphere was already similar to how he imagined Chernobyl did a few minutes before meltdown. The head producer told him to &quot;check on the new girl&quot;. Knocking on the door, he peeked his head inside. &quot;You ready, Jen?&quot; She looked for a moment as if she had been....praying? Meditating? Her eyes had been closed as she tilted her head up slightly towards the ceiling. She turned with mild surprise; &quot;Wha-? Oh, yeah...Steve was your name, right? We at the five-minute mark already?&quot; Steve couldn&#39;t help but look down at the blond&#39;s slightly-open knees as he uncharacteristically stammered &quot;Uh, yeah...fu-, uh, five minutes to showtime&quot;.  &quot;You look a little tense Steve, you can rest in here for a minute or two, I&#39;m heading to the set already.&quot; Putting a hand on Steve&#39;s shoulder, Jen looked in his eyes and said &quot;Look at me, I&#39;m relaxed and I&#39;m going to be the one up there. It&#39;ll be fine Steve, you just have to take life as it comes.&quot; before gracefully passing him and exiting out of the makeup room. <i>I wonder if she&#39;s blond down there too...</i> thought Steve. Jen was always cool as a cucumber, not to mention kind....and sexy. The guys of the morning crew had once brought up the topic of how long it would take someone to get in her pants. &quot;Forever&quot; Jerome had said &quot;She don&#39;t act like it, but she looks like an ice queen, and ice queens don&#39;t give it up easily.&quot; Her record on being asked out had confirmed Jerome&#39;s suspicions.<br />
<br />
<i>She&#39;s right. Just have to take it as it comes. I </i>am<i> tense.</i> Steve thought. <i>Good thing I brought my lucky charm.</i> He had found it in college; After he had moved into his dorm for the first time, he had discovered it in a drawer that had been left by the last occupant just the day before. He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes as beheld what seemed to be an woman&#39;s living, breathing vagina (well, not breathing but living certainly). Having asked around about any unusual sex toy shops nearby and hitting a dead end, he had begun washing it out when he started to believe it really <i>was</i> an actual living, breathing woman&#39;s vagina, as he watched in clench at the sudden cold and make his finger disappear when he slipped it in. Clearly, an evil wizard had stolen this woman&#39;s vagina, or turned her into a vagina, and then lost it. This made him now the de facto owner of free pussy as all of his attempts to find out the woman&#39;s identity had been fruitless and the previous occupant had said the drawer had been there when <i>he&#39;d</i> moved in.<br />
<br />
In the beginning he had tried to only have sex with her occasionally, as he figured the woman probably wouldn&#39;t want a perfectly-chaste life. But he had quickly succumbed to temptation, fucking the wet hole day or night as well as wearing her nearly continuously. He excused himself by saying that, had the woman been turned <i>into</i> a vagina she&#39;d be desperate for whatever stimulation she could get, and there was only one kind she could receive. The pussy never complained, eagerly milking his cock and draining his balls whenever he got excited. His friends sometimes commented on how he never chased girls, but none knew that he was hooking up whenever he wanted as he grew erect in her cocksleeve at the thought. Four years and thousands of cumshots later, he&#39;d graduated at nearly the top of his class. Afterwards, he had arrived here and, over the course of four more years and a total of perhaps ten-thousand times with the magic pussy, worked his way up the ranks in the morning shift before switched to the evening as assistant producer.<br />
<br />
Moving it back and forth in his pants, he grew hard as he tried to rub one out quickly. He had almost hit the point of no return when he was startled by a loud knock and the head producer&#39;s voice. &quot;Steeeeeve! Get out here! We&#39;re about to start!&quot; Four or five strokes away from cumming, he pulled his pants up and ran to the set. The motion of his running slid him around inside of the pussy, only edging him along. He felt sorry for whoever the unfortunate victim of the wizard was, as his dick felt as wide as a baseball bat trapped within the wet cage that barely contained it. <i>Even after all this time, she&#39;s always so tight...</i> Grabbing the cue cards, he began counting down. &quot;10, 9...&quot; He squeezed his shaft in time with the counts. &quot;8, 7...&quot; He was so close to cumming now. &quot;6, 5...&quot; Steve was startled for a moment; She was squeezing too, he realized! &quot;4...&quot; he looked around quickly and saw Jen looking around with the same perplexed expression. &quot;3...&quot; They locked eyes, and in that moment they understood. &quot;2...&quot; Jen looked at him and gave him a wink as a blush started to spread on her cheeks. &quot;1...&quot; He came.<br />
<br />
As Jen felt Steve&#39;s warm spunk begin to flood her womb once more, and her rectum trained the 18th athlete of the night, as she cheered him on in the final stretch with her anal ring, Jen started her broadcast &quot;...and I&#39;m Jennifer Smith, your co-anchor for the evening, and you&#39;re watching KCTV news!&quot; <i>Just take it as it cums...</i> Jen thought behind her confident smile as they began the top stories.</p>
