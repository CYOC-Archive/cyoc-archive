<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want both&quot; replied Jen quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Jen, time is almost up you kno- You say what?&quot; Kyle, who wasn&#39;t listening replied.<br />
<br />
A little bit louder this time, &quot;I would appreciate it if I could trouble you to give me both options, please.&quot; Jen repeated, in an uncharacteristically polite manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... yeah. Ok. Well since you asked, you get both.&quot; Confirmed Kyle, a bit taken aback for a moment by the sudden 180° difference in her personality. For years, Jen always had been quite the annoying bitch at school. Lazy, skipped classes often, loud, stuck up, never did her work, and hung around all of the other girls like that. In fact she had quickly joined the cheerleading team, which just about all of the others made up. It was a squad of girls with some of the worst personalities. It didn&#39;t help that almost all of them were from wealthy families with connections to the school. It was how they got away with a lot of things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. And I only request that you leave my little sister out of this, if you could. I take it that this is something between you and me, so please don&#39;t hurt her.&quot; Proposed Jen.<br />
<br />
Kyle knew about Jen&#39;s sister. Actually, he was one of the few who did. Jen for some reason always distanced herself, and kept from associating with her at school. She was a year younger than them, and if being honest, he had a bit of a crush on her for years. <br />
<br />
She was like Jen in terms of appearances. Actually they were practically identical in that reguard. It was to the point where on the rare occasions that people saw them together,  they usually would mistakenly assumed they were actually twins. <br />
<br />
Personality wise though... she was a nightmare. If Jen was considered a bitch, her sister was a demon in saint&#39;s clothing. Outwardly appearing as a cheerful and kind hearted girl, but in reality, she was really a very manipulative and scarry person. She was incredibly, and rather abnormally intelligent for her age. And did her best to hide it. Kyle had found out by accident though. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am not messing with that demon, only you today. And yeah, this is payback for pantsing me in front of everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that is fine. Then if you could be so kind, please proceed with the curse, Kyle.&quot; Politely instructed Jen. <br />
<br />
[What the fuck is up with her today?] Thought Kyle to himself. &quot;Now then, lets start with your transformation. It will be a few parts, so as follows:<br />
<br />
1) You will have the sense of smell of a female dog. <br />
<br />
2) You will be able to smell an animal&#39;s arousal when they want to mate. It also makes you a bit horny too, increasing the more you smell and think about it.<br />
<br />
3) Your body secrets a pheromone similarly to how a female dog does when she goes into heat. This will only begin to happen tonight though, and will last for a week, repeating monthly. Durring this period you too will enter a state similarly to being in heat. Basically you are constantly really horny unless someone fucks you. It wont be to the point where you can&#39;t go about your day to day life, but will make you very susceptible to sexual advances, but only by those you are interested in. This pheromone will be attractive to males, some not entirely straight females, and your friends, causing them to consider fucking you. Though animals will be more likely to do so than people. And your direct family is immune to it.<br />
<br />
4) Your body can reproduce with any living animal safely, as long as they are at least big enough, say at least as large as a medium sized dog, but not too large, like elephants, rhinos, and whales. Your pregnancy duration will follow the male&#39;s species&#39; average rate too.<br />
<br />
5) You will begin to heavily lactate the moment you lose your virginity to an animal.<br />
<br />
6) No matter what it is, all of your offspring will be able to be safely breastfed by you. And will live entirely off of your breast milk for the rest of their lives, at least, unless you die before them. Then they will switch over to a normal diet after you pass. Your boobs will not be harmed while feeding, and you may gain more rows of them depending on how many mouths you need to feed. But no more than 3 aditional rows with 2 boobs per row (8 boobs total).<br />
<br />
7) Your diet will adaptivly update to include the general food source of anything you mate with. This simply adds alternative options for meals. For example, say you fuck your dog. You now can healthily live off of an entirely dog food diet if you wanted to. Not that you couldn&#39;t eat normal food too, it is just that you could also just eat dog food and meet the same nutritional requirements, even if everything needed isn&#39;t present in the dog food. In other words, dog food becomes a miracle food source to you once you have been fucked by a dog.<br />
<br />
7) You will be able to understand any creature you mate with. Specifically just the one you mated with though. And it isn&#39;t like you suddenly can speak their language or hear them talk in english, you just instinctivly know what they are trying to tell you.<br />
<br />
8) You will grow a german shepherd&#39;s dog tail, and your tongue will become dog like too. Plus all body hair below your neck will permanently disappear.<br />
<br />
Alright that is it for you transformation. I think it is pretty good for a payback. Don&#39;t you agree? Anyways now for the dare, which also has a few parts:<br />
<br />
1) You will become sexually attracted to certain members of every species included in part 3 of your dare. And your dog specifically will be included too.<br />
<br />
2) You will host a party tonight inviting some of your closest friends over to spend the night. Durring the party right before you all go to bed, your dog will enter your room. You will smell your dog and go into heat, while also beginning to pleasure your dog. You will suck him off, do a little bit of fore play, then eventually get fucked by him until you both are knotted together. <br />
<br />
2a) All of your friends will watch the full thing happen in front of them. They will react how they normally would, with the exception of that they will not attempt to stop you or get someone to stop you. <br />
<br />
3) You will thoroughly enjoy sex with whatever it is that is fucking you. But you will have a big preference for your dog. You will continue to let your dog fuck you whenever he wants from now on, and will always let him decode the where and when.<br />
<br />
4) Bestiality will be legal for you, and anyone who joins in with you, so you can&#39;t get in trouble for doing it. But it will not change how people react to you doing it, with the same exception from before, applying to everyone.<br />
<br />
5) You will gain some slight behavioural characteristics of a dog which unless you activly try to not do them, you will do without thinking. This is stuff like panting, walking on all fours, sniffing things and/or asses when greeting people, being naked, eating with just your mouth and tongue etc. Basically you will generally act like a dog unless you focus on not. But don&#39;t worry, literally focusing on anything will keep you acting like a human. It is just when you become bored, tired, or have nothing keeping your focus will you slip into your &#39;dog mode&#39;.<br />
<br />
6) You can&#39;t use the curse to get back at me in any way, nor undo your own curse.<br />
<br />
7) You will Transform or Dare one of your besr friends and give them the same curse, except with a different animal other than your dog. They will instead gain that animal&#39;s behavioural traits, tail, and tongue too.<br />
<br />
8) Gou will be completely obedient to me and will happily do whatever I command you to do, even though you don&#39;t understand why, you just feel like you have to do it.<br />
<br />
9) You will forget this conversation had ever happened.<br />
<br />
And that should be everything. Oh, also, and while I wont make this a dare, but please don&#39;t let your sister continue to grow up being quite as manipulative as she currently is, and can you see if she wants to go out with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Certainly. I-I can say with the upmost confidence that she wishes to date you very much. But I got to go now. I-I mean, thank you for calling me. I appreciate the opportunity to make it up to you for my various misdeeds against you. And I wish to truely apologize for what I have done to you. I hope you can forgive me.&quot; Said Jen, but this time with just a hint of nervousness cracking through her polite facade. Kyle had hung up so she too put down the phone only to look over at her sister who was sitting on her bed, still glaring at her.<br />
<br />
If there was a single thing Jen feared in the entire world, it was her sister, Kara. Not that Kara was physically abusive to her or that she was victim to Kara&#39;s actions some how. But Jen knew more than anyone else how protective Kara was of the things she likes. And today, Jen had found out that Kara really likes Kyle. And that Kara was pissed off at Jen for humiliating him. <br />
<br />
By coincidence, Kyle had called them. And Kara walked into her room right as she picked up the phone. She even handed her an index card telling her to read it out loud to Kyle, which she did. The moment Kyle began her curse, Jen panicked. <br />
<br />
Her sister had already written everything on the next 2 cards that she handed to her. Which meant that Kara orchestrated this entire thing as punishment for Jen. That was what terrified Jen. That ability of Kara&#39;s to pull this off flawlessly, and without directly doing any of the dirty work herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, as you are forgetting that phone call, please know that I am aware of everything he said since I wrote it for him&quot; Kara admitted, grabbing back the index cards. &quot;So try and remember not to cross me in the future, or I will have you turned into an actual bitch for good instead of just certain parts.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that Kara hopped off the bed and walked out. Jen, just stood there confused. From her perspective, Kara just walked into her room, apparently threatened her just now, though she had no idea what she meant by it, and left. Jen didn&#39;t even know why she was being threatened. This was why she tried avoiding her sister as much as possible. She was scary with how she acts. Like she was pertending to be a boss in the Mafia or the head of a Yakuza family or something, except for the fact that she wasn&#39;t joking around.<br />
<br />
A chill ran down Jen&#39;s spine. Wanting to just get past her sister, she turned her focus to her party that night. She was having a few friends sleep over, so she was excited for tonight. But maybe first she better wash her sheets, and her clothes, and maybe also the carpet, she could smell them just being in the room, and they were not smelling quite as good as she had thought. Maybe burning a candle would mask the smell too. One thing was certain though. Somewhere, there was an amazing smell like no other. But what was it?</p>
