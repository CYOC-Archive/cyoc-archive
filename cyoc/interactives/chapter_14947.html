<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Barber had been expecting a corporate gog in a wheel to enter his store but was surprised to find two young Native Americans entering.  He had transformed these into their current identities several weeks back when they were two black electrical workers in their early 40’s.  They had asked too many questions about the shop so, in an act of self preservation he switched them out with a couple of college kids who he turned into matured muscle bears.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back gentlemen, I’m sort of surprised to see you again.”<br />
<br />
“So you do know us…” one of the bys said in a soft raspy voice. “People were forgetting who we were.  Hard to think sometimes…..” <br />
<br />
“Hard to think?” the Barber said helping the two young men into the chairs.<br />
<br />
“Thoughts, memories of….. being different.”<br />
<br />
“Of being older?  Of being a different race?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” The both chimed in as if he had solved a mystery for them.  Their eyes, while brighter now, still have a sheen of confusion on them.  Their long black hair was pressed against their heads as if not washed in days and subjected to great amounts of sweat.  Neither one looked like they could grow a full beard but piece of facial hair had sprouted here and there, not shaved off.  <br />
<br />
“I see, I see.”  The Barber said placing the cloth around each of their throats. “Gentlemen I’m not having a very good day am I.  Here I have to apologize again.  You see…… there are times when the alterations I put people through are more than their systems can handle.  It’s usually in cases where, as in you cases, you were less than willing participants and….. maybe didn’t deserve all of the changes.”<br />
<br />
The two boys sat still confused and unaware of what the Barber was talking about.<br />
<br />
“Let’s start work on setting things right.  Now, honesty’s a plus here guys.  You’re allowed to remember just enough of the old personas.  Take a moment to absorb that info. Now, given what you’ve been allowed to remember and what you know of your new lives, what do you want to do?  Go back?  Or just be set on a different path?”<br />
<br />
There was a slight pause before both boy mumbled, “different path.”<br />
<br />
‘’Thank heavens.  First, because if you still want a different path, then you’re not totally 100% mad you’ve been taken from your old life.  And second, returning things to the way they were is a pisser.  Let’s set things straight.  Well, not straight….”<br />
<br />
The Barber started on the first man’s hair and immediately the changes started.  The boy aged a bit in years, to his early 20’s but looked a bit older.  Looked like he lived a bit more in this new skin.  His skin was also changing, becoming a bit darker brown, more Hispanic tone than the Native American honey tone he had before.  The man shrunk down a bit in the chair, down to about 5’4” with his build becoming a bit more sturdier than the lean smooth boy he had been for a few weeks, but not the out of shape 40 year old he originally was.  His face rounded out some as he took on the appearance of a Native South American.  Stocky but short, hands agile but with smaller fingers.  Legs were no longer long stealth like muscled tree trunks, but solid short legs with wide caves.  His arms also shank a bit but now bulged with muscles like his previous incarnation could never have.  His biceps blew up like bowling balls as light purple veins etched across the circumference.  The man’s face rounded a bit, the brows got heavier and a light sprinkling of facial hair appeared at the corners of his mouth and on his chin.<br />
<br />
            Even though the Barber was done with him, and moved onto the next man, the changes continued.  Across the massive arms highly detailed tattoos started drawing themselves in place.  Not the hip tribal kind carefully worked out by one artist, but the real, character and word driven tattoos of a man who had been many places and seen many things.  Some more faded than others.  From his wrists, up his arm and around to his back.  Dove tattoos appeared on each shoulder and Jesus smiled from his right pec.  Large gauge earring appeared in his left ear and silver chains hung around his next, several with traditional crosses dangling form them.  <br />
<br />
            The Barber’s work on the man’s friend also took the boy into early manhood of the mid 20’s.  His long hair was shorter now, a mass of tight curls.  His skin got darker than his friend, an olive brown free of blemish and body hair.  His nipples dark and a bit on the large side.  His face retained a slight innocence as did many young men from Portugal as he now was from.  His height stopped at about 5’3” but his build was not as stocky as his friends, but proportioned none the less.  His finger grew a bit longed and his dick thinned out a bit.  His chin pointed some but it was soon hidden under a light beard that crossed from ear to ear, but no mustache grew in.  Simple tattoos appear on each arm but then the silver started to come in.  Ears were pierced many times from top to bottom, rings and studs in ear eyebrow and a small rod in the nose.  His tongue was pieced, which he would find bit of a hindrance since his English was not what it could be and his accent heavy.  His arms though were the most effected by the addition of jewelry.  From the wrist almost to the elbow silver bracelets appeared.  Some thin, almost as thin as floss.  Other thick and heavy.  His scrotum was soon dotted with thick rings and two PA hung from the end of his dick.  The final touch was a small simple ring hanging from his left nipple that had a tiny ruby hanging from the end. The man would be setting off metal detectors in a 3 block radius.<br />
<br />
            “I think this turned out much better don’t you, Gentlemen.”<br />
<br />
            “Si, si,” the first man said running his hand through his hair “Just want we wanted.”<br />
<br />
            “Just what we needed.” The other said also getting out oh his chair and checking himself o tint he mirror across from him.  <br />
<br />
            “Great. I aim to please.  Thank you for coming in away from your jobs and letting me correct my mistakes.  It’s so convenient that you work right across the street from the shop.  Don’t forget your work shirts.” the Barber said pointing to a couple of denim work shirts that hung from the coat rack. One said Jesus and the other Francisco in script lettering in the front and Krumwoodie Motorcycle Works on the back.<br />
<br />
            “Shit man, we better head back of the Boss’ll be pissed.”  Jesus said as his pulled on his work shirt.  The sleeves were missing since most shirts in his usual size range were not able to accommodate his massive arms.  <br />
<br />
“I have an idea he might be a bit late himself today, but along shortly.”<br />
<br />
It was only a few minutes after the two men left the store and headed across the street to their new jobs when the original customer the Barber was waiting for appeared.  He was younger than the Barber expected given that he was suppose to be a great business man.  At least his lawyers had made him out to be one, but then, thanks to the Barber, the lawyers weren’t who they thought they should be anymore either.<br />
<br />
“Hey there.  I was supposed to meet some of my crew here.  We’re looking to buy this block and they said there was a problem with this store?”<br />
<br />
“No problem. I’m just not selling.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe it’s a perception thing that I can’t get you to see just how big of a problem this is going to get for you.  The first rule of business is to make your problems someone else’s to get rid of.  And you wouldn’t believe the problems I’ve had trying to clear this block out.  First my partner is suppose to scope the area out but disappears.  That was OK actually ‘cause I married his wife and got back his half of the company.  Then I hired the cops looking into his disappearance to start spreading stories of drug pushers and they ran off with my money.  And then there was that group of idiot thugs I sent out to shake you all down but the probably stumbled across some real crooks who took them out.  Last trick was I bribed some utility workers to start fooling around with everyone wiring, but I can’t see they did any work out there.  Maybe they went and get all ethical on me...” the business man said pacing back and forth before coming to a stop inches away from the Barber’s face. “So you can see my frustration at all these problems.  I’m in no mood to dick around anymore”<br />
<br />
“Well, problems for you maybe.” The Barber said standing his ground and beginning to play with the hair on the peak of the man’s forehead. “Did you know that in some cultures the word for “problem” and “opportunity” are the same?  I think these same cultures also have one word for lawyers, business developers and assholes.”<br />
<br />
“Cute, what your hands there, fella.”<br />
<br />
“No, you watch.” With that the Barber grabbed the tuff of hair had been playing his and yanked it down.  Almost like a statue being unveiled the clothes and skin of the man tore away, split down the sides almost like there had been an unseen seem holding it together.  Leaving in its place was a 6’5” bodybuilder, large, strong and pumped.  And very confused.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK?” he screamed in a voice many octaves lower than before.<br />
<br />
“Ah, very good.  Not so much a good start but where you’ll end up so to speak.  Got the basics but I think we’re going to need to fine tune this, don’t you?  Have a seat.” The Barber lead the confused giant of a man to the Barber chair and sat his down.  The cloth went around his neck and the Barber went to work.  <br />
<br />
The Barber went to work on the man’s hair, which started growing out a dirty blonde and turning a bit on the grey side.  He loss a bit of hair on the top of his head, but it stopped at a noticeable thinning but a male pattern baldness gap of hair.  That part though became the greyest, almost white.  A beard formed on his face which unlike the hair on his head wasn’t grey but almost white.  The hair on his head stopped in mid back and his beard stopped just about his collar bone.  This was not a well groomed beard but a real full growth of hair, even leaving his checks furry.  A slight yellowing around the mouth from the constant stream of cigars that would soon be smoked day and night.<br />
<br />
With the grey hair the man began to age some.  Stopping in his late 40’s the grey now took on a suggestion of having lead a rough life, premature aging to fit the several lives he already squeezed into the one.  Not like before where his life was sitting behind a desk and planning, this life was of one who went out and lived it.  He remained Caucasian but his skin took on a tanned tone, almost wind burnt in places.  A slight loosening of the skin too place as age caught up with the build.  None of the muscles loss their size, but the skin wasn’t quite a taunt across them.  His hands grew huge and calloused from work. As were his feet. His body hair exploded and at times ever masked the tats.  A thick coating of blonde/grey fur covered his chest and back. A slight gut formed over the belly and the ass sagged just enough to show he wasn’t perfect.  Tattoos spread across the arms and chest.  Some hinted to a Naval carrier, others mentioned various biker groups.  Then once the tats were set, then the scars came in.  Some faint, others so deep the disrupted the natural flow of both the muscles and the tats.  Earrings appeared in each ear and large hoops through the right nipple.  The scar on the left nipple hinted the hoop that had hung there had been ripped off at some point long ago.<br />
<br />
“It’s haircuts like that is why shops like this should never go out of business.” The man said taking a cigar out of his leather vest and lit it up.  His boot hit the floor and he raised himself out of the chair.  On the back of his vest was another ad for Krumwoodie’s Motorcycle but with the words “Owner” underneath it all.  What had been a 20 something yuppie business man was now a biker daddy n all his glory.  Years of moving form one place to another ended when he opened the bike shop across the road just a few days back.  Settling down wasn’t the plan, making roots was.  A red bandana came out of his back pocket and was wrapped around his head.  “Seems like though I was suppose to meet someone here today.”<br />
<br />
“Your employees.  They were I here earlier but you hadn’t arrived yet.  I gave them a quite trim but I’m afraid it made them late for work this morning.”<br />
<br />
“That’s alright.  You do good work, the shops nit open for business yet and now I have a reason to kick a couple of asses when I get over there.  You sir, have a good day.”<br />
<br />
The biker exited the store and walked across the four lane street to is new shop.  Instead of the front entrance or the huge overhead door they would need for all the motorcycles there were going to be working, he went around the side to enter.  Didn’t want to confuse anyone that the place was open yet.  <br />
<br />
Instead of finding his two employees getting the shop ready, he found one on his knees sucking the other off while he jerked himself to climax.<br />
<br />
“Real good fuck heads. Is that what I pay you for?”<br />
<br />
“Yea.  Along with fixin’ ‘cycles.” Francisco said with a huge grin on his lips.<br />
<br />
“There’s a ‘bonus/bone in the ass’ joke in here somewhere boys but let’s just get to fuckin’.” The Boss said tossing his cigar to the floor and putting it out with his boot.  His hands went to his belt and undid the large belt buckle but it wasn’t till he had push Francisco over the Harley’s seat did he drop his drawrs.  Francisco immediately offered his ass up to his new boss, turning around and bending over the motorcycle’s seat.  “Think we might have something to use as lube around here.”<br />
<br />
Jesus handed reached over and scooped out a small handful of industrial strength hand cleaner out of a small jar on one of the benches.  It was smelly stuff but could take grease out from under fingernails with little effort.  He handed it off to the boss but left the remaining goop in his hands for the moment.  After taking a second to coat his large growing dick with the stuff, the boss pulled one of Francisco’s ass cheeks aside and pushed into his hole.  He was a big man with a big dick and while Francisco was still a bit high from the sucking Jesus just gave him, I he still felt the penetration down deep.  The Boss’s pant slid to the floor as is pumping increased.<br />
<br />
Seeing his opportunity Jesus scooped up some more of the hand cleaner and started coating his fingers with it.  Walking up behind his boss he played with the big man’s ass a bit and slowly started inserting one finger into his hole.<br />
<br />
“You be careful what you’re doing back there son.”<br />
<br />
“You want me to stop.” Jesus said inserting yet another finger into the pumping ass.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t say stop, just said be careful.  You think your dick is big enough to reach my ass though son?”<br />
<br />
“I think we’re good right here.” Jesus said steadily pushing his hand into his boss’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap DON’T!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Way to late to protest, cause I already have.” Jesus said opening his fist inside his boss’s insides and closing it again. “Feels great don’t it.”  But the boss was in too great a shock to respond.  He could only shoot his load into Francisco and still not move.  “Got a little present from the Barber.” He said as he started pulling his arm out to the wrist and then pushing it back in.<br />
<br />
And with every pump the Boss became younger and younger.  The massive build melted away into that of a thin young teen.  Jesus could feel the shoulder muscles constrict as he used his free hand to steady himself by holding onto the guy’s shoulder.  The long hair shortened some while out went the grey and in came the blonde highlights.  It was still a bit on the greasy side.  The beard pulled into a few strands on the chin and lip, more from a lack of shaving for a few days that any real fashion statement.  The body hair all but fell out and the tattoos started fading away.  His beer gut left of course but wasn’t replaces with a normal 6 pack, but an almost concave stomach of someone who hadn’t been getting too many good meals.  Except for a few simple home made ink tats, the detailed ones would have to be earned.  His legs became leaner and smooth, like a runners or someone who was used to being on their feet all day.  His clothes remained the same, demin blue jeans and a tank top shirt, but they looked even rattier than before.  <br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” the former boss asked in a higher, slightly effeminate voice.  The voice of a young teen, not a weathered older male.<br />
<br />
“Mr Barber, he wanted me to tell you that the man you were is no more.  And the man you had turned into is still possible.  But he’s not going to let you gain all that right away, not after what you did.  What you saw is going to be the end result.  What you see now, is the starting line.  Enjoy the ride.”<br />
<br />
Jesus pulled his hand out of the boy’s ass so quickly there was almost a comical popping noise.  The young man fell to his knees, panting and even sobbing a little.  He was a lean young man, perfect skin, tight and tones but not muscular.  His ass was a bit on the booty side but that added to his attractiveness.  This was a teen that even in his few years of life, had seen better days.  <br />
<br />
“Never…… never did anything like that before.  But I did it.  You said if I did it you’d let me work around here for a few days.  Helping you clean the place up for the opening”<br />
<br />
“Yea, yea sure. Ask your folks if it’s OK and we’ll let you apprentice around here.”<br />
<br />
“My folks threw me out.  I’m sort of been living on, and working, the streets for the past month.”<br />
<br />
“Cripes. OK, we’ll work something out.  We’ll give you some work here for the time being and figure out something to do about living arrangements.  You’re in luck that Frankie and I know something about what it’s like for young boys out on their own with nothing but their ass to sell.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll get you back on you feet and on the right track kiddo.  Even spring for a haircut when you’re ready for one.”</p>
