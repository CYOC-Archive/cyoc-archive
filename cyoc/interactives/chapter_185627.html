<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack decided with how good this all felt, and how surprisingly into being this old he was, he would stay around on this beach. See if there was anything else going on around here. He had to imagine there were other people who had been changed in the same way he was - and honestly, meeting someone else with the same sort of change seemed hot in its own kind of way. Hunter of course was free to tag along and enjoy the sights and sounds. Jack was glad to have someone equally capable of appreciating the male and female sights here.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s...&quot; Jack gestured at a young surfer guy who suddenly looked a little closer to 30 after his trip into the waves, &quot;Looking pretty well developed. You figure he&#39;s gonna be up for some fun later with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Hunter contemplated, and his eyes went to a couple of young woman observing the surfer, enjoying the sight of him flexing his biceps shortly after coming to shore. Two of them were stunning redheads - not obviously changing yet - while the third of them was a brunette in a poorly fitted swimsuit that obviously had fit earlier, before the changes visited themselves on her, &quot;Quite some babes here today. Fuck, I feel ready to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like your taste, man,&quot; Jack responded with a smile.<br />
<br />
As they ventured closer, the surfer approached, now closer to 32 than 30 - his short cut blond hair growing longer and his muscles looking bulkier and stronger than before. He still looked every bit as handsome as he was, his mischievous looking twinkling blue eyes looking between Hunter, Jack and the women who had been checking him out. &quot;Wow, seems like I have all the admirers today.&quot; He barely seemed aware of the changes happening to him.<br />
<br />
Much like Jack had been at first. He was keen to keep it that way, see where things went with this guy. &quot;Well,&quot; Jack said as he looked at the surfer and then at the women, &quot;There&#39;s a plethora of beauties here at the beach, for just about anyone. What&#39;s your name, big guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The surfer grinned, subtly flexing his chest and showing off his build, &quot;Max. I heard this place has all kinds of age related transformation, which I have always been into. Looking to spend my days a variety of ages. See how much I can enjoy myself.&quot; Jack couldn&#39;t tell how old Max was originally, but going by his confidence and assured manner, he guessed probably around 20 or so just going by his own perception. <br />
<br />
Two of the knockout women approached, sizing up the three men available. The brawny and powerfully built Jack, the slim and hairy, well toned Hunter, and the strong, built Max. One of the redheads was definitely seizing everybody&#39;s attention, her hair framing her face in its wavy curls, her athletic yet lightly tanned body inviting their lust and adoration from its lack of clothes. &quot;Well, if you boys are interested, I&#39;d be up for some fun. My name&#39;s Amanda. I purchased something pretty special from the shop here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She made a kissing motion, and said, &quot;Specialty Intimate Age Up Gloss, a transformational gift to your partners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter crossed his arms in front of his chest, pondering what this was leading to, &quot;Go on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, according to my friends, who know first hand, I&#39;m quite gifted with pleasure given to women and men alike. So how about a game?&quot; Amanda said with a coy smirk, &quot;I&#39;ll give any fine gentleman a blow job here, with the catch that I have my Age Up Gloss on. So the longer you enjoy my talents, the older you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack wasn&#39;t exactly sure what getting any older would mean for him, after all, he was already like, fifty, right? He looked at Max, and then at Hunter, who were obviously keen on the idea. Both were obviously turned on - Hunter being nude registered it much more keenly and obviously, whereas Max&#39;s tight, tiny little speedo quickly joined a pile of clothes tossed off - showing a very nicely formed, large manhood. Honestly, Jack felt a complicated mix of lusts - for the amazing and sensual, tempting Amanda, for the well muscled, strong Max, and for another round with Hunter.<br />
<br />
The men turned to consult among themselves, to see who would be willing to go for it;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I&#39;m still in my twenties, so I can probably take whatever she can dish out,&quot; Max stated, clearly not knowing how far he had changed already. He was about 32 right now, and both Hunter and Jack wondered what effect this underestimation would have on anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling good to go with this. I&#39;m already pretty charged up.&quot; Hunter stated. Yeah that tracked, Jack decided. Hunter was visibly erect and definitely ready to go. He was just wondering how much of an effect would be visible on him going by this.<br />
<br />
Jack considered it himself. He was fifty already, but Amanda said she was amazing at oral, and Jack had always wanted a shapely, beautiful woman like her to give him a BJ. Yet the fact of her lip gloss remained. She would be making him older at some rate during their sexual episode. Well, Jack thought, he could find a way to regress a bit - after all, this was the age wing in general. Not the aging wing in particular. But even so, Jack was conflicted...</p>
