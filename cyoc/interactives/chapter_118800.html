<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dark figure pounced on top of two of the bandits, and holding them down with four of its six clawed legs. The last bandit moved to strike the basilisk with his axe, but the basilisk looked up and the bandit immediately stopped in place and fell to the ground dead. Louis realized that the basilisk used its death stare to kill the attacking bandit with the axe , and it did the same to another one of the bandits and then bit the head off of the third and devoured it whole.<br />
<br />
Louis attempted to crawl away, and he whimpered with fear as he watched the basilisk feast on the corpses of the bandits. Suddenly the basilisk turned its head hearing Louis&#39;s cowardly whimper, and Louis immediately covered his eyes trying to avoid looking into the creature&#39;s eyes. The basilisk walked over to Louis growling then paused as it was about to slash at him, and looked at his body. Louis paused and looked at the basilisk puzzled, but trying to keep away from looking into it&#39;s eyes. The basilisk then saw the blooded wound on Louis&#39;s leg and sniffed it, then licked it. Louis felt the beasts forked tongue on his leg, and this only worried him thinking that the creature was gaining a taste for him.<br />
<br />
The basilisk then proceeded to bite at Louis&#39;s wound and broke the skin around it, and he screamed in pain feeling the bite on his leg. Then the basilisk backed away worried and confused, and Louis saw a knight approaching, and smiled, but passed out from blood loss. <br />
<br />
Louis woke up later woke up, and he expected to be in some sort of bed being nursed, but instead was inside of a cage, and chained to the floor by his limbs and collared at the neck which was also chained to the floor. &quot;Huh? What&#39;s happening?!&quot; Louis yelled, but his voice and words only formed a loud and distressed roar. <br />
<br />
Louis then looked down and was shocked to find that his body was covered in thick black scales, with six large reptilian 3 digit digitigrade claws instead of hands, and a reptilian tail. Louis then saw a bowl with water inside of it and he peered at his reflection and saw a black scaled basilisk staring back at him, and he was the size of a horse. Louis then began freaking out, and noticed that his dick was in a reptilian sheath, and that he could move all six of his claws and tail individually with little effort. &quot;H...how could this h..h..happen? I&#39;m human, and a shepherd, not a beast! How am I going to tend to the animals like this?!&quot; Louis thought worried and hiding under his front claws in fear, of what might happen.<br />
<br />
Louis then heard voices talking one sounded mad, and the other was trying to reason with it, and saw two shadows arguing around the corner. &quot;That thing is a beast! Nothing more, nothing less! As a knight you should understand what we do to beasts like this right!?&quot; The voice of an angry man said<br />
<br />
&quot;That &quot;beast&quot; as you say it was a human boy, and as a knight the law states that if humanity remains then I will have to take custody of him, and take matters into my own hands! You know nothing about this situation, and how much it affects everyone if he dies!&quot; Another angry voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you realize how dangerous these things are? They can kill a man just by looking at them! I serve to protect the people, and as such I cannot allow a beast like this to roam free!&quot; The first voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;A beast like this? What kind of beast cowers at it&#39;s own reflection, and covers it&#39;s head as to hide in embarrassment and disbelief?! If he was truly a beast then he wouldn&#39;t feel those emotions, and by law I call for an inspection by legend!&quot; The second voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;You know as well as I do that the inspection is not necessary, and the &quot;beastblood&quot; legend is just a myth! You have no authority to deny this beasts death!&quot; The first voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I do, especially if he passes the inspection, and if you still deny him life and freedom if he passes then the penalty is death by the blade of a knight! I would be happy to volunteer my blade to that death at this point!&quot; The second voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;Under whose authority?&quot; The first voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;The authority of the grand wizard himself, and you know just as well as I do that his knowledge surpasses all. So if you don&#39;t mind, I would like to see the cell key if you will.&quot; The second voice said<br />
<br />
There was a pause and then the first voice spoke up,&quot;Humf, I hope that that beast devours your body while you are still alive to witness it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louis then heard footsteps, and saw a man wearing the same armor as the knight from earlier walk over to his cell door. &quot;Basilisk, I don&#39;t know who you are or why you have become like this, but what I do know is that you were human so please close your eyes as to not slay me by your sight.&quot; The knight said, and Louis closed his eyes, and heard the door to the cell open.<br />
<br />
Louis then felt the knight&#39;s hand on his side and flinched at first, but let the knight pet him along his side. &quot;There we are, now I am going to ask you a few questions, and I trust that you will answer them accordingly. First, do you remember being human?&quot; The knight asked and Louis nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have memories of having family by blood, wether you were married or not?&quot; The knight asked and Louis nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were in the woods and had a chance to hunt a group of an unarmed and innocent family of four with children, would you kill them?&quot; The knight asked and Louis vigorously shook his head &quot;no&quot; and he felt tears in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will now be standing behind you, open your eyes and scratch out your full name, and your occupation for me, and then close your eyes Immediately concluding.&quot; The knight ordered and Louis nodded and opened his eyes. Louis used his claws to carefully scratch out the information on the stone floor of the cell, and then back away from the words and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
Louis then heard the knight walk over and pause for a few moments. &quot;Good, now just stay calm, I am not going to harm you despite what you hear.&quot; The knight said and Louis heard a sword draw, and his breathing grew heavy and nervous. Louis then heard clanging metal sounds and felt his chained coming loose around his body, and finally his neck except it still had a chain which was being tugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, and follow my lead, and here&#39;s something to help keep your eyes shut.&quot; The knight said and tied a cloth around Louis&#39;s eyes like a blindfold. Louis could still tell that the knight had his sword drawn, and he followed the knight&#39;s lead as his collar was being pulled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you doing?! I thought I told you that this beast was to be put to death!&quot; You heard a voice that sounded like the one who was arguing with the knight earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thought that I told you that I would take custody if Louis passed the test, which he did.&quot; The knight said<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just give that thing a name of a human child?!&quot; The voice asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he told me by scratching a message within his cell, now step aside and leave us be.&quot; The knight said<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious, you realize that this is an outrage! The people will be in a panick!&quot; The voice said<br />
<br />
&quot;The people will be panicked by a knight leading a blind basilisk through the streets with his sword drawn just in case it attempts escape? If that is true then you are performing your duties as captain pathetically.&quot; The knight said<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not stand here and let you criticize me, and endanger the pe...!&quot; The voice began and Louis heard a sound of a sword being partially unsheathed, and one of a sword being swung and then there was two thuds and the sound of some sort of liquid splatter. Louis then picked up the scent of something strong, and it smelled like blood, human blood, and he whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pay no attention to that, wether by moral or instinct he only wanted your death, and that is something that I won&#39;t stand for at this moment. Now I am going to tell the villagers that you are tame, and you will act tame until we get to a carriage that&#39;s at the edge of the town.&quot; The knight ordered and Louis nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, have you killed anything before you became like this?&quot; The knight asked, and Louis shook his head viciously as if he was against ever doing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, can&#39;t say that pacifism is much of an option for you in the future, considering multiple characteristics that you have gained. I will personally make sure that you are safe, but just be careful at what you look at.&quot; The knight said and Louis nodded as the knight lead him and...</p>
