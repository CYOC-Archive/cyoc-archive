<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As some Animalians began preparing for the IAC and some of the coming summer, Horizon was still focusing through various other parts of everything else that was going on, and this heavily focused on dealing with the Covid 19 pandemic, which was still raging. Things were getting better as more people were getting immunized and by now all the Dinotopians had been vaccinated, but for regular Animalians, they&#39;d still been waiting. For the previous administration had delayed allowing Horizon access to provide research into a vaccine for it, and thus when they did get the opportunity to start working on it, they were well behind nearly everyone else. The blood tests that indicated that the vaccine for Dinotopians wouldn&#39;t react well to regular Animalians provided another setback, and only got a new start when Gooseberry had caught Covid while dealing with one of her odd jobs in the town near the Bowman farm.<br />
<br />
But from there, Horizon was able to make progress in getting a vaccine developed. It was slow going, largely as they had to request access to a local clinic&#39;s lab, or at least facilities that could be set up as a lab to then work with Gooseberry in setting up what would become the main Animalian Vaccine. It was small, but the clinic had been willing to spare the room, and for Melvin Qvite, Horizon&#39;s CEO, this had been a big benefit, given that the Animalians in the area had some connections to the Bowman Farm and while not all of them worked on the farm, at least not full time, they held it near and dear to them. Thus cooperation between the clinic, Horizon, and the local Animalians was becoming a source of hope for things moving forward, and Melvin had come to get a close update on the progress being made as they prepared to move into the next phase of the project and actually begin testing to see how it would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never expected you would be coming here in person,&quot; said the clinic nurse who was escorting Melvin.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some cases, I don&#39;t, as Horizon&#39;s business is big,&quot; Melvin answered as he glanced at the rather spartan décor of the hallways that he was following the nurse through on the way to the area that had been set aside for his staff. &quot;But all of this is important and with developments seeming to be on schedule, I would like to be able to do more than just send a token email or phone call for these things. Particularly as much of Animalia is largely on edge because only the Dinotopians have been able to be vaccinated so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
He followed along until they came to one door that was along a back wall. There was a normal sign that had been set aside for office space, but presently had a white paper with Horizon&#39;s logo printed on it and a sign that read &quot;Horizon Animalia Covid Vaccine, Lab 1&quot; written on it. It was here that the team that had worked in developing the Dinotopian Covid Vaccine with Molly was working to develop the main Animalian Covid Vaccine in Wisconsin so that Gooseberry could remain close to &quot;home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you make progress,&quot; the nurse commented, &quot;it might help with all the people resisting getting the vaccine... particularly with all the stuff going on with Johnson and Johnson...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin nodded and let the nurse then turn to leave as he looked back to the door. Some of that news story had unnerved him, and was a memory of the problems of a rushed development project with the original human vaccines that all were sold in a way to try and influence the last election. That had already made many Humans nervous about the vaccine, the last thing Melvin wanted was for there to be some sort of failure that couldn&#39;t be predicted or under reported. He had to make sure things were not only progressing but progressing correctly. Melvin knocked on the door and waited calmly and waited for an answer. It was answered by a lone man who nodded and stepped back, while gesturing to the room.<br />
<br />
He entered into a modest room that was smaller than many of the laboratories in the main Horizon offices, and packed three people along a long desk that ran along the far wall with a computer and various pieces of equipment that were there to help manufacture the vaccine to test. Underneath the table there were a series of small refrigerators that had biohazard warnings in them. That was likely where all the virus samples and the blood samples were. There were also sets of cabinets on the right wall that were marked to have hazard suits and other safety equipment in them, which helped increase the sort of cramped feeling that the room had, but it wasn&#39;t something that could be avoided. There were only two chairs and one was larger and occupied by Gooseberry, herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, Mr. Qvite,&quot; the lead scientist said to Melvin, &quot;I take it you&#39;re here for more than a progress report?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;as the reports made it seem like you&#39;ve made relatively good progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have, sir,&quot; the man that had opened the door spoke up, &quot;Gooseberry here has been cooperative, and from the blood work that we&#39;ve done and tested, we think we have a formula that would be ready for testing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin nodded, as those reports had come across his desk and in emails. From everything that had come through, it was seeming that the main Animalian Covid Vaccine was ready to move into the first sets of tests to see on how well it would work subsequent exposure. That was a plus, but with some of the reports coming out on some of the issues with the Human vaccines, there was also the importance of making sure that Gooseberry and any of the other volunteers that would be testing the vaccine were fully aware of this. Melvin wanted to make sure there were no problems and that Gooseberry was aware of the potential problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you think we are ready to move into the next phase?&quot; Melvin asked, &quot;actual testing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the lead scientist nodded, &quot;with the formula we&#39;ve developed with what Gooseberry, here, has provided us with enough to be ready for it and the blood tests have looked more than effective. We can start with Gooseberry here and then move the tests over to the others from the Bowman farm... with the exceptions of Blueberry and Meryl, given their present pregnancies. After that we can then move the tests to volunteers in Lyre/Animalia and the Coelacanth Animalians at Dinotopia Aquatica.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though these tests could be applied more locally and assuring that the situation would be safe for those that would be coming here to the clinic,&quot; the man that had opened the door added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that would be good,&quot; Melvin nodded, &quot;but there will be other issues that I would like to make sure that Ms. Gooseberry, here, is aware of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that would be, Mr. Qvite?&quot; Gooseberry asked from where she sat, looking between Melvin and the scientists that had been periodically needing blood samples to test and develop the vaccine Horizon was developing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legal ones... and ones that relate to what&#39;s gone on with the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine,&quot; Melvin spoke, &quot;I know you&#39;ve already had to deal with this disease once, and there could be the potential that if the vaccine test fails, you could contract it again, and have worse responses to it and the disease. There could also be other issues that could come as a result of this vaccine that we don&#39;t know about yet. And your health is important and I want to make sure that you&#39;re willing to participate in these tests and that that those on the Bowman farm... would they accept these risks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would... and they would,&quot; Gooseberry insisted, &quot;this pandemic has already touched us and made a lot of things here struggle in one way or another. And it&#39;s seemed like there are some that don&#39;t want to get vaccinated, which means they could get sick... either with the original or with these new ones going around... getting some immunity would be good. I&#39;d be more than willing, and so would the others on the farm. Particularly as there will be a wedding to go to come summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Melvin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Nate and Shuixing will be getting married after he graduates from the University of Wisconsin,&quot; Gooseberry answered, &quot;and that... like the schools letting out... won&#39;t be too far away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin recognized that. Animalia Ambassadoria had already made comments about getting ready for summer. A bit early, perhaps, given that WSA started its school year in late August and and didn&#39;t end until around a week before Memorial Day in May and that they were only in April at the moment, but students would likely be looking forward to the end of their respective school years and hoping to have gotten through this year without major interference. Major colleges like the University of Wisconsin were likely no different.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it would appear that the wedding is to be on Heiya Island,&quot; Gooseberry answered, &quot;with both the authorities there and with the Bowman&#39;s minister in two ceremonies to honor both American and Chinese traditions. But with everything going on here, they are wanting anyone and everyone coming in to have been vaccinated, or at least the first shot if it takes two shots. Thus, I&#39;m more than willing to participate in the test, as would the others and hopefully have it so that we&#39;ve been cleared. And by June, when the wedding is supposed to be... Meryl and Blueberry will have given birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Melvin said slowly, &quot;and that is quite noble... but I still must be sure you understand the risks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we do,&quot; Gooseberry answered.</p>
