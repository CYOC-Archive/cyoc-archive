<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan stepped over onto the shrink side of the carpet, trying to guage his height so he could return to normal.  As he dropped to 7 feet, he picked up his pants and began to slide them on.  As soon as it was possible for them to slide up his thighs so he could button them, he jumped off.  Ryan noticed that his pants were somewhat baggy compared to when he had arrived, and after putting his shirt on, he noticed the same.  No matter, he would just shrink down a few more inches, dropping to 5'8&quot; so that he could have an easier shot at growing up.<br />
<br />
He stepped onto the square, feeling the ground slowly approach him.  The room seemed to swell around him as he shrank to 6 feet, 5'11&quot;, 5'10&quot;, 5'9&quot;, 5'8&quot;.  He jumped off, probably around 5'6 and a half.  He looked around, trying to encompass everything.  This was a vantage point he hadn't seen in years.  He looked over to the growth carpet and stood on it, feeling his height return, his clothes stopped bunching and hanging, slowly tightening around his growing frame.  It felt good.  Soon, his shirt had tightened back to it's original state, and his pants rode nice on his hips.  &quot;I wonder...&quot; he thought &quot;what it would feel like to grow until these clothes rip right off?&quot;  It didn't take long for the now 6'3&quot; Ryan to decide.  He stayed on the square, feeling his whole body inflating, new mass coming from nowhere, making him taller and wider.  His shirt tightened across his chest, lifting up past his bellybutton.  His jeans tightened at the thigh and calf, slowly exposing his ankles as he grew to 7 feet tall.  The clothes showed no sign of ripping, instead they constricted against his body as he grew taller and taller.<br />
<br />
  Soon he had passed 9 feet, finding himself crouching in the room that was once so expansive.  The zipper of his jeans had broken open, and the button long since dissappeared across the room. His huge as was stretching the seat, but the thighs of the jeans had exploded, relieving the pressure from the butt.  The stretchy shirt had made it's way up his abs, now that he was 12 feet tall.  It was under his nipples.  He sat down as he grew to 14 feet, his expansive shoulders almost touched both walls.  His jeans had fallen off now, but the lycra-esque nature of the shirt was preventing it from ripping at all.  He felt his legs touching the other wall of the room, and noticed he was curled up considerably.  He was over 20ft now.  The shirt should have ripped.  He estimated himself at 24 feet.  He felt his back touching the ceiling, and the tip of his 3 and a half foot dick ride gently across the carpet.  The ceiling began to crack, and his shirt began to rip, now that it was only a necklace.  He felt the ceiling lift up as he crunched through it.  His dick fell across the scratchy carpet, now that he was 33 feet tall, his coiled body had pushed its way into the upper floor.  he felt his feet crushed through a wall, and his 5 foot dick starting to retract.... wait a second... retract?<br />
<br />
He used his massive hands to destroy the rest of the ceiling to reveal the room below.  His huge cock and balls were on the shrinking square, now down to 3 feet again.  They should have lifted away from it since they had shrunk, but the rest of his body growing pushed them back onto the square.  Now it was 2 feet!  The 42 foot teen began to freak as it shrank down to less than a foot, probably 6 inches long.  He found it hard to move, locked in position as he was.  He slid his body over to the shrink square and began his descent.  He slowly shrank down 40 feet, 30 feet, 20 feet, 10 feet.  The whole ordeal took around an hour to complete.  Finally he was back into his 6 '2&quot; frame.  He looked down at his cock, squinting. it was less than visible, microscopic even.  He tried hovering it over the growth square, but it was just too small.  He even tried taking a pushup position... no luck.  He couldn't get it to touch... what would he do now?</p>
