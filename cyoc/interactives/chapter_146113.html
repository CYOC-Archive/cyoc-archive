<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike looked to the Chronivac his son showed him and was amazed at the what it can do.  Transformations, age change, gender, modifications, this program has it all.  Makes him wonder what to do with it.  As he was thinking about it, he soon came up with something that would help both him and his son.<br />
<br />
See, back when he was young, Jeff always go to the zoo to see the animals.  But his most favorite animal would be snakes, mostly a Boa Constrictor.  Giving the size and strength of them, he was fascinated in how by move and how long they are.  There was a time when Jeff wished to have one like that of a pet.  The problem is that snakes like the Boa is super expensive and his family can’t afford one.  But if he uses the Chronivac, he can use it to turn someone into the Boa Constrictor and Jeff will have a pet.  And the person that would turn into a Boa is himself.  There’s a reason why.<br />
<br />
Mike has always been overworked and there was little time to spend with his family.  After all that hard work, he can finally get a week break and spend time with the family, and mostly Jeff.  Normally, he had plans for the week, but seeing the Chronivac, being a snake for a week would not only have his son have a pet he wanted, but can give himself a chance to relax for the week.  And if he knows one thing about snakes, they know how to relax.<br />
<br />
Turning to Jeff, he told him, “Say Jeff, I think I got an idea on what to do with the Chronivac.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard him and wondered what he got.  “Really?” he said, “That’s great!  What do you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
Mike soon approached him and asked, “Remember when you said you wanted a Boa Constrictor for pet?”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that question and remembered something like that.  “Yeah…  I remember…  But I was young when I wanted a snake, I never knew that that they would be dangerous and they are expensive to purchase and raise.  Why you ask?”<br />
<br />
“Well, considering that we now have this Chronivac of yours, I thought it would be a good if I would become your pet snake for a week.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard him and was surprised by what he said.  “Seriously?” he asked him, “You want to be a Boa Constrictor for a week?  That was suppose to be your vacation and was planning to spend the week with me and the family.”<br />
<br />
“I know…” he said to his son, “But seeing this program, why not spend it relaxing like a snake.  Besides, all that stress in working would make me want to laze about.  And snakes to lay about most of the time.  So I think it’s best that I get to be a snake for a week and when it is all over, I can return to normal and it’s as if nothing happened to me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and was a little concerned about it.  “I don’t know…  It does seem a little risky…”<br />
<br />
Mike sighed and decided to guilt trip him.  “Do you really want to abandon your dream of having a Boa Constrictor as a pet?  Do you want me to feel miserable for a week in my vacation?  I sure you would do what’s best for your father.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard him and gave it some thought.  At first, it might be cool to have a Boa Constrictor as a pet, like back when he was young.  But turning his own dad into one for a week, that seems a bit of a risk.  Still, his father wants him to be happy and if it means risking his vacation just to slither around and feed off of mice, then so be it.  With a sigh, he said, “All right dad.  I’ll do it.”<br />
<br />
Mike smiled and said back, “Thanks Jeff, I promise that I’ll be the best pet you will have, even if it’s for a week.”<br />
<br />
Jeff soon approached the computer and went on the Chronivac.  “I need to set some things up before we can make the change.  This is my computer after all.”<br />
<br />
Mike nodded and said, “Sure thing, son.  Just let me know what you’re planning.”<br />
<br />
He soon stepped aside to do something while Jeff selected the Animal Package and clicked on the Reptile sub selection.  Once he select Snake, there was an information list where Jeff can write down the information of the target and what the target will change into.  That’s when he decided to type in his father’s information and what he will change into.  By the time he was done, he started to review what he selected.<br />

<br />
Once Jeff read through the changes, he told his father what’s going to happen.  “Okay dad, here’s what I did so far.  I selected to turn you into a Boa Constrictor.  You will be twelve feet long, which is an average height for a snake pet with the age of fifteen as a young adult age.  I set you sex drive to 50% and made you an obedient house pet, so you can listen to what I have to say.  I set the mental change so you can think like a snake, but there’s a ratio of the mental change so I set it to 99.5%, just so the only human thing you have is just your first name.  I even set the awareness on both you and me, as the only way to help us remember what happened and alter reality so people won’t suspect you missing.  And I set the transformation time to ten minutes and the duration a week, like you said.  You think that’s all right with you?”<br />
<br />
He waited for a response from his father as he told him, “Sure, that’s good enough.  Can’t have my family and friends find out that I am missing and keeping just my first name as a pet snake seems very fitting.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and turned his chair around to see him.  “So, you’re ready for your journey in snakeho-“ he was about to ask, until he sees something unexpected and covered his eyes in shock.  “What the-!  Dad!  What the Hell!?  Why are you naked!?!?”<br />
<br />
Indeed, Jeff’s father was naked.  When Jeff was jutting down the information for the changes, Mike decided to strip down so he can change freely.  Removing his business suit, Jeff had a good enough look his father’s nude form.  He was once a military soldier with a chiseled body fit for going to war.  Now that he’s a family man, his body was showing somewhere and tear.  The muscles he once possessed was soft with his chest just a pair of man boobs and a medium muscle gut.  He also looked like a bear with salt and pepper hair on his chest, stomach, arms, legs, back, and a deep push on his privates.  There were also a couple of signs of aging which includes a tattoo knife with a rose through it on his left arm and a scar on his right side where he had his kidney removed due to an inflation.  Even his face was showing signs of aging as he had wrinkles on his eyes and mouth, a medium bulbous nose, and tired eyes.  And his once full head of hair was thinning in the front as an arch with a bald spot in the back of his dome.  So basically, he’s an average middle age family man in all his glory.<br />
<br />
With a smile, he answered his question.  “What?  Can’t I change naked.  Had to take my clothes off so nothing would in fact ruin the changes.  And besides, I need to see myself change naked.”<br />
<br />
“Still, the least you can do is keep your underwear on.” He said still covering his eyes, “So I don’t have to see your penis waving around freely.”<br />
<br />
Mike laughed it up and said, “And ruin my boxers?  I don’t think so.  If I am to see my change, I want to go all out.  Now start it up.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed and knew that his father want to experience it all.  “Fine…  But I’ll look at your face without looking at your junk.”  He soon went to the ‘Transform’ button and clicked on it.  There was also a warning that popped up that says…<br />
<br />
‘Warning!<br />
<br />
By choosing these options, you are permitted to change the target into a Boa Constrictor for a week. The Chronivac is not held responsible for the destruction of property and death of target. If the target dies, the changes will be permanent and the target will not return to normal.  Are you sure you wish to continue?’<br />
<br />
Seeing the Yes and No option, he looked on and was concerned about that part.  If his father dies while he’s a snake for a week, he won’t get him back.  Still, Mike really wants to be a snake for the week vacation and would want to have Jeff happy.  So he went on ahead and clicked on the ‘yes’ option and another pop up appeared with a timer below it.  It says…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac!  Enjoy your change!’<br />
<br />
The timer started to count down from 10:00 to 9:59 to 9:58 and so on.  Jeff soon turned to his father, without looking at his privates, and asked, “Well…?  Any changes so far?”<br />
<br />
Mike looked to himself and didn’t feel anything.  “Nothing so far…  But it’s just the start of the changes.  I sure it will kick in any-“  Before he could finish, he could feel a tingling throughout his body.  From head to toe, he could tell that the changes were starting.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was his body temperature.  It started to drop like a rock as he felt shivers up and down his spine.  It almost felt like he was out in the arctic cold, but was indoors.  “Brr…  Did to heater stopped or something?  I’m freezing here.” Mike said as he was rubbing his arms.  Jeff looked to this as well and figured out what it was.  “Must be your body temperature dropping.  All reptiles, including snakes, are cold blooded.  Cleary you have to be one as well”  Mike heard that and knew that he has a really good point.  “Guess it’s true.  Guess I’m no longer human if my blood runs cold.”<br />
<br />
He soon looked to arm to see the goose bumps popping up from the change of his body temperature.  But as he was starring at it, he soon noticed something else.  On his arm, bits of his hair got plucked out of his skin and slowly floated to the ground.  He looked to his other arm and saw the same thing happening there as well.  Curious, he spotted full-length mirror for him to see and approached it.  When he got a good look at it, he was amazed as all of his body hair started to shed like that of a dog, small at firs, then turning into clumps, and then a full on shedding.  His chest, back, and stomach were the most noticeable as it came down like a waterfall and left the front completely hairless.  His arms and legs were less noticeable, but shedded away like the front body, leaving nothing behind.  He lifted his arms up and looked to the pit hair, which was detaching one at a time until it was bare.  The same goes with his pubic hair around his penis it started to get less bushy, until there was no bush at all.  He got a closer look at his face and noticed his beard was molting, so much so that rubbing his face, his entire beard was completely shaved off without the shaver.  And the remaining hair on his head started to decrease as the bold spot got bigger and the shoreline god deeper.  By the time the top of his head was completely bald, it spread down his sides and back of his head until it reached the bottom.  Even his eyebrows and lashes got picked off as he blinked his eyes to see them all bare as well.  Soon enough, Mike was completely hairless as his body was smooth and bare.<br />
<br />
Looking down to himself, he saw a huge pile of hair that’s wrapped around his feet.  “Whoa…  Am I really that hairy?  I didn’t think that it was that much.” he said looking at all his hair and then the rest of his body.  Jeff chuckled and told him, “Well, this is what you get for not shaving.  You should remember that when you return to normal.”  Mike turned to her son and said, “No way.  That’s just as messy as now.  You know how long it will take?  I won’t waste it.”  “Perhaps, but maybe I can make an exception with the Chronivac.” his son said back.  Mike sighed and went back to looking at himself.<br />
<br />
As he starred at himself in the mirror, he noticed something else.  All around his body, he could see his muscles were firming up and his face was loosing some roughness and wrinkles.  Turning around, he could see his gut decreasing and flattening as he could see his six pack abs returning.  His man boobs started to harden and flatten, giving him a chiseled pecs.  His flabby arms started to tone up and bulge, giving him biceps of a military man.  And his face was now firm and handsome with no wrinkles or tiredness on his face.  Looking on, he soon noticed that he now looked like a 25-year-old man in the prime of his life.<br />
<br />
Starring on, he was amazed that he’s back in his buffed and young body.  Turning back, he asked his son in a younger and clearer voice, “Jeff, what happened?  I thought I was going to turn into a Snake, not getting young.  Don’t get me wrong, I like to see my old body back in my post college days, but that’s not what I wanted.”  Jeff crossed his arms and told him, “Well, a snake’s lifespan lasts up to 40 years.  That includes a Boa Constrictor.  And since you are over forty, I thought that I cut your age in half, so I can have a snake young enough to move around and not be dead.”  Mike heard his son’s reasons and knew that he got a really good point.  “I guess it makes sense.” He said, “Can’t be an older snake that would die off, so a younger one would do just nicely.”  He soon looked to the mirror to see what other changes will take place.<br />
<br />
Starring on, he soon noticed something on his left upper arm.  The knife rose tattoo started to fade away with the color dimming and the ink color thinning.  Soon enough, his tattoo was gone and left a blank skin behind.  He looked to the scar he had on the right side above his abs started to shrink away and thinned into there was no scar at all.  His navel was filling in and there was no indication of a belly button on him.  The same goes with his nipples as they shrink away until they pop out of existence.  Looking to his hands, he noticed that each of his nails started to pop off and fall to the floor with the mess of his body hair.  Same goes with his feet as he lifted on up to see his toenails falling off his toes as well.  The top it off, all of his blemishes and birthmarks faded away leaving his skin nice and smooth.  Looking to his body, it looked alien to him, but it was somewhat human.  That would soon change.<br />
<br />
Looking to his arms and hands, he could see scoots and scales slowly spreading across his skin, deepening in between.  Looking to the mirror, he noticed lines appearing on his stomach, chest and neck while more scales invade his face.  At that time, the skin on his arms, legs, back and head darkening as the skin on his stomach chest and neck lightening.  Even his back and top of his head was showing diamond pattern appeared and steadily growing, covering the spot completely.  Soon enough, the scales darkened into shades of brown and black, forming geometric patterns with just his arms and legs devoid of any patterns.  The scutes on his underside became light and pale, in contrast to the rest of his body.  In contrast, he almost looks like a human in snake skin with the only thing human is his penis.<br />
<br />
He starred in astonishment and didn’t think that the changes will progress to that.  “Wow…  That lookssss ssssso ssssureal.” He soon heard the sound of if voice and realize that he was rolling his S’s.  Curious, he opened his mouth to see what happened.  That’s when he saw his own tongue thinning and splitting into a fork.  There was also as slit forming as the nearly created tongue slipped in.  But that’s not the only thing that was changing.  When he opened his mouth, he could see all of his teeth detaching from his gums and falling to the floor.  So much so that the only teeth left were his canines at the top and bottom.  Those teeth soon grew and became pointed at the ends, forming into sharp fangs as ducts appeared at the base of the fangs formed a vemon extract to paralyze a snake’s prey.  It now looked like the inside of his mouth was that of a snake.  Mike looked on and decided to test out his voice.  “Tessssting, tessssting.  SSSSShe sssssellssss sssssea ssssshellssss by the sssssea sssshore.” He said and realized that he was saying, “Lookssss like I’m sssspeaking like a ssssnake.”  Jeff watched on too and knew that as well.  “Looks that way.  You now got the lisp of a snake.  It would be a matter of time before you loose your ability to speak.” He said to his dad.  Mike soon poses in front of the mirror, flexing his reptile muscles.  And while it was cool that he has muscles in snake skin, but it won’t last for long.<br />
<br />
As he was flexing, he felt an arousal in his nether regions as he looked down to see what it was.  That’s when he saw his dick started to tend up and was fully erected.  Mike felt a growing, basal urge to pleasure himself, as he grew more aroused.  Even if Jeff is looking, he can’t control it.  So without warning, he started to place his hand on his boner and started to rub it up and down.  Under his touch, he felt his dick begin to morph and shift.  The head lost its shape, the tip blunting while the rest of it became continuous with the shaft.  The shaft itself was somehow growing wider and a seperation was forming in the middle.  Suddenly, the shaft split into two in an immense rush of pleasure, forming two cocks.  So much so that he used his other hand to get the new dick and is now masturbating with two hands.  Jeff looked on and was horrified to see his dad stroking two dicks and didn’t care that he was with him.  Mike grunted as he came powerfully, ejecting a huge load of cum.  His balls had emptied out all their remaining human sperm, and began to change as well.  They pulled upwards and popped back inside his body, journeying to the proper positions in a snake.  His now empty scrotum shriveled back and flattened as the skin there turned smooth too.  While his dicks continued morphing into their new reptilian forms, a slit appeared in the smooth skin surrounding them, forming their new protective home.  Fully spent, his flaccid cocks retreated into the slit, leaving Mike with a smooth crotch that bore no evidence of his former manhood and testes.<br />
<br />
Jeff covered himself and was distraught by what he saw.  “Dad!” he said to his father, “That was gross!”<br />
<br />
Mike turned to his son and apologized for what happened.  “Ssssorry about that.  Guesssss the Chronivac forced me in ssssself massssturbation to turn my dick into that of a sssssnake’s.  Ssssshould’ve been warned about it.”<br />
<br />
Just then, he felt something in the base of his spine and turned to see what it is.  Looking into the mirror, he noticed a small bump at the bottom end of the spine, just above his buttocks.  That said bump started to grow out and extended longer, slowly but surely.  When it reaches half its mass, Mike soon realized that it is his actual tail that’s growing.  Rubbing it, he could feel the texture of the tail and felt nothing but pleasure.  But when he was touching it, the tail twitched and moved, as muscles started to develop.  He was in awe at the sight of it and couldn’t help but to feel excited over the changes.<br />
<br />
“I got a tail.” He said to himself, “I got a sssssnake tail!  This is sssssso awesssssome!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked and could tell that Mike is enjoying himself, trying to forget what he just witnessed.  “I’m glad you are you happy about you becoming a snake.” He said to him, “But remember, you’re going to be my pet snake for a week.  You’re not going to be like that forever.”<br />
<br />
“True…” Mike said as he turned to his son with a bit of a smirk, “But later on, that can be rearranged.”<br />
<br />
As he was saying that, his tail kept on growing, extending down his legs.  In fact, it grew so big that his butt cheeks merged with his tail and dragged his anus with it.  The anus itself grew smaller and sucked into the tail between the scaly lines.  The tail soon went down to the floor and lay there for a while.  Mike looked back at the tail and was in awe at the sight of it.  He kept rubbing the tail and was transfixed by it.  So much so that he didn’t realized his hands were getting tired.<br />
<br />
Curious, he looked to his hand and noticed that his fingers were getting shorter and stubbier while his arms grew smaller and thinner.  He looked to his other hand and noticed that it too was doing the same.  Not only that, but his feet was beginning to get tired as he looked down to his legs and noticed his feet are getting smaller while his legs were compressing.  Seeing this, he realized what’s going to happen next and turned to Jeff for help.<br />
<br />
“Looksssss like my armsssss and legsssss are going to disssssappear.” He said to him.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to his father to see his appendages were shrinking and weakening, as he’s having a hard time standing for too long.  Worried, he told him, “Maybe you should sit down.  Could make it easy for you.”<br />
<br />
Mike heard that and nodded, slowly sitting on the floor.  It was a trying chore, as his smaller legs can’t maneuver much, but he succeeded and was sitting down, looking right at the mirror.  Already, he could see all four appendages half of their original size.  Looking to his hands, all of his fingers were just tiny stubs and his hands were less noticeable.  The same goes with his feet as the toes had now dexterity and were just tiny bumps on his smaller feet.<br />
<br />
As he looked to his arms and legs, his body seems to be stretching.  Apparently, as he was loosing his arms and legs, he’s gaining height with his body as his back popped one vertebrae after another.  He also noticed that all of his muscles were deteriorating as his body started to thin away, almost into a cylinder like shape.  Soon enough, his arms and legs were sucking into his body while the body itself grew what was lost.  In a matter of moments, his appendages sucked right into his cylinder body as his height shot up so high, that he almost touches the ceiling.  Looking to himself, it was a huge Boa with a human head.<br />
<br />
It took him awhile to adjust to his height as he could control his long body with great flexibility.  Getting to see himself in the mirror, he was amazed of how weird his body is.  “Check me out!” he said anticipation, “Thisssss  isssss ssssso sssssureal.  It’ssssss almossssst like my body, but not.  How inssssane!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to it as well and could agree with him.  “I know.  To think that you look like a snake in body, but human in head.  But I’m sure it’s going to change soon.”<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, Mike felt his head tingling and realized that what his son said is coming true.  “Looks like you are going to get what you want.  I can feel my head changing.”<br />
<br />
Already, his head started to take shape as his nose pushed out into a snout, taking the mouth and eyes for a ride.  His ears grew small and vanished completely, leaving behind tiny little holes to hear.  His eyelids pulled back and vanished in the membrane as the snake eyes itself which are already at the sides of his head, pushed out to make him see much more clearly.  Soon enough, his head now that resembles a snake with no evidence of his normal human self.<br />
<br />
By the time that was over with, his mind started to simplify as all human knowledge was draining from his head.  He can feel everything emptying while reptilian instinct.  “Yesssss….  I can feel it….  Human memoriesssssssss, human knowledge, fading…  Ssssssssnake urgesssssss and insssssstinctssssssss, risssssing…  Everything getting ssssssso sssssssimple…  Sssssso free…  Sssssssooooooo….  Peasssssssssssful…  Sssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooo…  sssssssssssssssssssss….”  That was the last thing he said as he lost his ability to speak.  Soon enough, his human mind is no more as the snake took over.  The only thing he remembers about being human is just his name and that’s it.  Now all that’s left is a huge snake throughout the room that seems too big for him.  Jeff looked on and was surprised that this monstrous snake was once his own dad.<br />
<br />
Once the metamorphosis is done, the snake started to shrink down to its average size.  Well, average for a 12-feet Boa Constrictor.  Once it was done, his father is nothing more then a pet snake for Jeff to have.  Mike looked to himself as he coiled his body around to get a good look at himself in the mirror.  Jeff watched his former father looking at himself and was impressed that the Chronivac could do something like that.  But he was curious if he was still aware of the changes, let alone if he remembered a small part of him.  So approaching him, he bent down to his level and said his name, the only thing left where he was human.<br />
<br />
“Mike…?”<br />
<br />
Mike heard his name and turned to see Jeff starring right at him.  He hesitated for a moment, but kept going with asking, “Mike…?  Dad…?  Can you hear me?  Do you understand what I am saying to you?  If so, nod your head.”<br />
<br />
Mike looked on and heard him for a seconds, looking in a trance.  Almost instantly, the snake gave a light nod.  Jeff looked at that and was relieved that Mike still remembered a small glimpse of his life.  “Good.  I thought for certain that you were just a normal snake.”<br />
<br />
He soon lifted his hand up to offer him a lift.  Feeling content, Mike stretched his snake like body out and placed the chin on Jeff’s palm.  Soon enough, he made the journey as he traveled up his arm, wrapping about it, behind the neck, and wrapped around the other arm.  Jeff soon gets up and approached the mirror, holding his now pet snake in his possession.  Looking on, he smirked and said, “You know, Mike, I think you look really good for a pet snake.  I might even get use to this.”<br />
<br />
Mike heard him and looked to the mirror to see himself with Jeff.  Positioning his head to his former son, he smiled a little while flicking his tongue with excitement.<br />
<br />
As they were enjoying the moment, something strange was going on.  In front of the mirror, Mike’s clothes and hair were scattered around during the change.  But then, they all started to liquefy and melt into puddles before joining together into a huge one, like that of Terminator 2.  All that liquid started to move to the corner of the room as the room itself started to expand down one side and the furniture moved around to make room.  This meant that the alter reality option is starting to kick in.  Once all the liquid gathered together in one corner, it started to grow and solidifying, shaping into a rectangle cube.  Once it came into fruition, all of Mike’s clothes and hair became a side snake terrarium that’s on top of an additional dresser full of pet supplies, including a shoe box filled with mice.  The terrarium itself is set to a tropical environment for a Boa Constrictor, filled with exotic plants, sandy floor, dead bark, and a small cave for a Boa to sleep in.  Even has a sun lamp to keep the snake warm and a water bottle on the side to keep the snake thirsty.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to that and was surprised by what he saw.  Mike did too as Jeff looked to him and told him, “Look, Mike.  Looks like your clothes and hair became a terrarium for you to live in.  Guess reality set in for you’re environment.”  Mike looked to Jeff and nodded with glee while slithering his tongue.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon wondered about the final change and approached his nightstand next to his bed.  He soon pick up a family portrait of his family and observed it all.  It was then he noticed something off and looked to his now pet to see it.  “Mike!  Take a look at this!”<br />
<br />
Mike heard him and looked to the frame picture as well, wondering what he wants to see.  On the picture is the entire family, Mike included as they were gathered for Christmas.  But then, the photo started to ripple like water with rain until it was obscured completely.  By the time it returned to normal, they could see the entire family together, but not the father.  Instead, it was Mike the snake wrapped around Jeff’s body.  Seeing this, he knew it meant that the existence of Mike the dad is no more.  Now, it’s Mike the pet snake of Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at that and was impressed by it.  “Well, it looks like you’re no longer a dad, Mike.  You’re just my pet snake now.  How do you feel?” Jeff asked him.  Mike turned to Jeff and wanted to say something.  But now that he’s a complete snake physically and mentally, he can’t answer anything.  But he can still respond in some way as he got close to his master’s face and licked his nose.  Jeff felt that and knew that he liked it.  “I take it that you love this new life.”<br />
<br />
Just then, the two could hear a ding from Jeff’s computer.  Hearing that, the two turned to the computer and approached it to see what that was about.  That’s when they found a message on the Chronivac and it says…<br />
<br />
‘Transformation Complete’<br />
<br />
‘Duration of Change Commencing’<br />
<br />
‘Time Remaining: 1 Week | 7 Days | 00 Hours | 00 Minutes | 00 Seconds’<br />
<br />
They looked at the pop up as the timer counted down by the seconds.  Starring at it, Jeff knew what it meant and talked to his pet about it.  “Looks like your vacation as a snake has started, Mike.  You’re going to have so much fun as my pet.”<br />
<br />
Mike hissed with excitement and coiled around his master’s body, wanting to have some fun with him.  Jeff could see how happy his former father is and thought of what to do with him now that he’s his pet.<br />
<br />
“Now then, how are we going to celebrate your week as my pet, Mike?”</p>
