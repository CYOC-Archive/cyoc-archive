<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before it had a chance to escalate into a real conflict Ashley sighed and simply offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take her in the morning....?&quot; his mom looked at him and raised a brow<br />
<br />
&quot;First thing?&quot; she asked putting a hand on her hip. She didn&#39;t wanna hear anymore of this annoying ID business. Everyone was a bit snappy together because of the hassle and fatigue of moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I&#39;m going to go get mine now then... you kids don&#39;t make a mess when you&#39;re done eating.&quot; She said putting some things in her purse finding keys and heading out to their new garage. She found her and her son&#39;s car parked inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well least the moving company got them here in one piece.&quot; she commented moving and getting into her front seat and started to head over to the processing center.<br />
<br />
As she drove down the street she saw a pizza girl stopped on the side of the road. A pretty girl talking to two officers, but they didn&#39;t look like normal cops their car had a P&RS logo on it. She seemed to be arguing with them before they started to put her into the back seat. She wondered if it was okay, but didn&#39;t want to get involved since they were in uniform and it was a pretty public spot so it&#39;s probably legitimate. She probably got caught selling or smoking weed or something while delivering pizza she thought to herself as she finally pulled into the processing center. She passed her husband along the way, but didn&#39;t recognize his car or notice him.<br />
<br />
She walked into the same office her husband had earlier and talked to the same woman Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello. I need to get an ID&quot; the woman looked over<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you must be Nicole?&quot; she asked before Nikki nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I go by Nikki though.&quot; the woman didn&#39;t seem to care just letting out an<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh... so you and your kids are here for IDs? I spoke to your husband earlier.&quot; she said looking up and peaking over her desk to look into the waiting room seeing it empty.<br />
<br />
Nikki shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, they were eating dinner they are going to come in the morning.&quot; she told them and the woman looked a bit annoyed at this and started to type on her computer and even cringed as if thinking to herself a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; the Nikki asked trying to peak at the screen but unable to see it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile back home Ashley and Jordyn were eating pizza and then realizing they had nothing to drink. They found a box of glasses and then shrugged figuring the kitchen sink had a filter already on it, so its probably fine. Both of them had a glass of tap water with their food. Just then back at the processing center Elizabeth smirked as she pushed a few buttons and shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Nothing is wrong.&quot; now lets get you processed. She typed some things out and then adjusted her glasses looking kind of jealous a moment before she finally push enter and Nikki would feel a chill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just head through there to pick up your ID I already got your info from your husband.&quot; as she headed down into the short hall way to the white processing room where her husband changed earlier her kids back home both let out a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... I feel so tired...&quot; Ashley said moving to try and find his new room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same...&quot; Jordyn mumbled being it with it out of no where also moving to find her room. Both found rooms full of boxes with their beds and collapse down and passed out.<br />
<br />
A little while Later Glen pulled into his house to find a whole platoon of men moving in and out of it with boxes and various other things in their hands. They look like they just finished raiding the place.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what the hell is this?!&quot; he blurted out to them as he parked. They seemed to ignored him before one man with a clipboard came over<br />
<br />
&quot;No worry Mr. Chase we were just setting up your house and bedroom with the new stuff for your new life.&quot; He was about to start complaining when they beeped the truck horn startling him a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all done lets move out.&quot; one man called out and they all started to swam away getting into their vans and driving off while Glen stood there like a fool calling out<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.. HEY!....&quot; he pinched his nose and headed inside. He walked in in awh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah... this is... nice...&quot; it looked like one of those set homes you&#39;d see on one of those house flipping shows. He could see some of their personal things mixed into all the new stuff as he checked out each room. He called out for his kids getting no answer. He checked Jordyn&#39;s room and he asked if she was okay, but she simply mumbled she had just gone to sleep and what was with all the noise before he told her not to worry and go back to bed. It was much the same when he checked on Ashley.<br />
<br />
Back at the processing center his wife was now on her knees having gone through the same painful thing her husband did earlier. She was all sweaty as her body had just dropped a lot of weight. Before she could think she felt water start to fall and arms start to strip and scrub her, before the loud sounds of fans could be heard as she was dried off. Once she was try her hair and make up was applied very fast as a robotic limb held her face before a pair of cream colored lacey bra and panties were placed on her. A pair of light pink heels, some tight white pants, and a light blue blouse, a pear necklace, a gold braceleted, some diamond earing studs, and a small stylish beige leather clutch purse were raised up on a table. She was about to scream when a mirror appeared in front of her and she looked confused at this half naked woman in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;The processing has been complete. Please take a moment and get dressed before heading out. There will be an orientation later this week, and information has been preloaded into your new phone.&quot; the same dry voice said that had informed her husband earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?...&quot; she let out raising her brows and cocking her head back looking this gorgeous woman over in the mirror who she was surprised mirrored her moves at first but then it all started to make sense. She also still looked like herself but with a more flawless faced. She was so much prettier now. Her hair was longer and styled with some slight curls down to the middle of her shoulder blades still a nice coppery shade of red. Her skin was a bit darker then it had been before and the freckles on her face almost seemed more intentional with the way they tickled around and over the bridge of her nose. The most shocking thing about her change though was for sure her body type over all. She used to be so chubby with thick legs and an ass covered in cellulite but now.. now she looked tight. She turned checking out her pert big butt that almost seemed too perky for a woman her age. She rubbed her hands over her now toned but still slightly soft tummy. Her hand moving up and having her new bust. She always had a bit of a modest b cup but now these were at least full c cups, but they looked like they were natural and not out of place. Everything about her now looked like she had spent her whole life taking care of her body to keep it hot. No more stretch marks on her legs, no more cellulite on her butt, no more wrinkles on her face, not even the C-section scar she had on her stomach was there. She just looked so flawless and not a day over 30.<br />
<br />
She then moved to check out her crotch to see it was good as new as well but she would be started as the voice called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am please save exploring for when you are at home. You have 5 minutes to get dressed and head out before you will be assisted.&quot; She looked over to the table seeing what she had to wear and getting dressed. She had a bit of trouble getting into such snug pants but it was probably the first time in her life she didn&#39;t mind struggling into pants as she checked out her new classy milf look. She checked out the jeweler as she put it on and mumbled<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow this is really just... for me?... god am I dreaming?&quot; she gushed overwhelmed and over joyed. She gave herself a smug smile before heading out and grabbing her new purse. Her time was up and some goons came in and rushed her out reassuring her much the way they had for her husband earlier.<br />
<br />
When she stepped out she finally opened her purse seeing her new phone and ID. It was the same model as her husband&#39;s phone but with some pink leather and a gold trim. She noted her new ID on the phone and then fished out a set of keys that weren&#39;t hers. She beeped the alarm and gasped seeing that the car it was for was actually a brand new car. The same model as the one her husband had gotten but hers was white while his was black. She got in the car and god sorted. She looked over and saw that pizza girl was now being escorted into the processing center. She wondered if things were okay when she got a text. She opened it to see a selfie of her hunky new husband in nothing but his boxers with a much improved bulge. He was holding a sexy nightie on a hanger and the caption said<br />
<br />
&quot;Based on your closet I can&#39;t wait for you to get home.&quot; this made Nikki&#39;s heart race as she started her car and headed home as fast as she could.</p>
