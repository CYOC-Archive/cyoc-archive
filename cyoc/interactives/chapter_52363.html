<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen knocked twice before trying the door of Naomi's house.  It opened and she entered quickly locking the door behind her.  Jen had been delayed at her house after she had gotten home from school.  With the short time limit on her mind she had sped over to Naomi's house heedless of of everything else but to get hidden before she once again became a pig.<br />
<br />
Jen stumbled over the forgotten bags of dirty laundry in the hall.  This was not good, thought Jen.  It seemed that someone else was here.  Naomi had said that her parent would be gone for the weekend.  The house should be empty.  Jen glanced at a clock and decided to put the laundry out of her mind for the moment.  She had to find Naomi.<br />
<br />
The house was empty and quiet as Jen walked to the stairs.  Cautiously, Jen moved up the stairs.  Down the hall that led to Naomi's room she found a discarded towel.  Stopping she inspected the cloth but could find no information.  While she paused she could hear a pair of voices behind Naomi's door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jen called timidly.<br />
<br />
The voices stopped and the door was opened soon after.  Jen was pleased to find Naomi's face appear even if it was the rubber coated version of Naomi that she had last seen in the girl's bathroom at school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jen,&quot; Naomi said.  &quot;Um, there was a little complication.  Cathy came home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is she?&quot;  Jen asked looking around.  &quot;Has she seen you yet?  Get out of the way I want to hide in your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she saw me,&quot; Naomi said quietly.  &quot;She's in here.  I had to tell her about the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Jen exploded.  &quot;We agreed to keep it secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but she saw me transform back to this.  I had to tell her or she would have freaked out.&quot;  Naomi turned then and mumbled something into the room before stepping out into the hall closing the door behind her.  &quot;I had to do it.  Jen please don't be mad.  But when she saw me turn to rubber I couldn't hide from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was a little hurt but the whole situation was awkward.  Besides that, Jen also had to confess something to Naomi.  &quot;Can we go somewhere else to talk?  I don't want her to see me change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded and the two moved to the bathroom.  In the brighter lights of the bathroom Jen could see how Naomi had changed.  Naomi wore a pair of fuzzy pajama shorts and a plain t-shirt that was quite large.  Jen found herself staring at Naomi's bald head as it reflected the vanity lights of the mirror.  It was a unique effect that was oddly pleasant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I explained the curse to Cathy she wanted to try it out, too,&quot; Naomi said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still have the magic?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she gave it back to me right away.  Don't worry, I let her know what happened and she is willing to play by our rules.  Can you let her in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was hesitant.  Introducing a new person would complicate the game.  How were they going to work it tonight?  It was while she was thinking that Jen felt the effects of the curse taking over.  First her nose started to extend and turn up.  She could feel her ears pointing and starting they're move to the top of her head.  Her hands became stiff as her fingers merged and her nails turned black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi, that's fine.  I like Cathy but I don't know how we are going to do this.  I guess we will work it out but please turn me back to normal before she sees me.  I don't want her to walk in on me like this.&quot;  Jen finished with a piggy snort as her transformation completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about that.  She won't be able for a bit.  Do you want me to ask you now?&quot;  Naomi said.  Jen nodded emphatically.  Naomi asked her and Jen selected.  &quot;Right, then, Jen you will transform back to a normal girl like you were right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen sighed with relief as she turned back to normal.  &quot;Thanks, Naomi.  But now I have to tell you something.  I was almost late getting her because I called Dean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; Naomi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, see I was trying to think of what I wanted to do with the curse tonight but I couldn't think of anything.  So I called Dean and tried to ask him what he would like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, did you tell your boy-friend about the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not in so many words.  But he didn't really understand what I was talking about.  So I may have invited him over tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Naomi yelled.  &quot;Jen how could you do that?  He is going to be here while we play?  He is going to want to join in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I told him not to come over until after nine o'clock.  I told him that was when your parents were leaving and they would not want a boy around without super vision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That still doesn't make a difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I thought we would have been done by then and might want someone to, you know, judge us.  Just to make sure that we didn't do something stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi was quiet for a long moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you mad, Nami?&quot; Jen asked hoping that she had not just ruined the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, you did the right thing, Jen,&quot; Naomi said finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just come take a look at Cathy,&quot; Naomi said moving back to her room.</p>
