<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Micah slammed against the brick wall lining the outside of the school, his glasses scraping against the harsh concrete.<br />
<br />
Colloquially known as the “School Punching Bag”, he was a magnet for bullying. The ten-year-old was scrawny and small enough for bigger kids to toss around, the manga and comic books he’d love to read a constant source of ridicule from kids who thought they were too nerdy. Today he was the target of his much larger classmate, Riley.<br />
<br />
“Come on, fag, don’t make it worse for yourself!” Riley harangued the stunned Micah. A junior wrestling champ, Riley easily mashed his shoulder into his prey’s chest, gripping Micah’s wrist in both hands, churning it to deliver a blistering Indian Burn. “Just hand over the milk money grandma gave you today!”<br />
<br />
An encounter like this with Riley happened just about daily and went the same way each time. Struggle as he might, Micah was no match for a muscular wrestler two years older than him and a head taller than him. He’d have to go without lunch today like he did every day for three years.<br />
<br />
“It’s… in my pocket…!” Micah gasped, fighting for breath as Riley’s arm compressed his chest. The bully chuckled and fished his hand into Micah’s pants, fishing out a little coin purse. A Kommander Kangaroo coin purse.<br />
<br />
“Still watching that gay-ass baby cartoon?” Riley smirked, the smaller boy shamedly averting his gaze as the bully opened the pouch… just to see it was empty. Riley’s smug smirk twister deviously, letting the coin purse slip from his hands onto the ground as he grabbed Micah by his shirt and hefted him up a foot in the air, smashing him against the side of the school building. “Dude, I told you to bring money everyday. You know what happens when you skimp out on me.”<br />
<br />
Micah shuddered. He could have sworn he put money in today… but his grandparents he lived with were often really forgetful about giving him money so sometimes he forgot and had to pay Riley’s “premium”. If only his real parents were still in his life. The smaller boy lifted his hands to cover his face, only for his necklace, an old Chinese round coin attached to a silver chain that he’d stashed underneath his T-shirt to fall out. Riley paused, watching it for a few seconds as it swayed as if hypnotized by the strange thing.<br />
<br />
“Hey. What’s that?” Riley demanded shortly, eyes transfixed upon the coin hanging against Micah’s chest.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing. It’s… supposed to be a good luck charm.” Micah shuddered, back scraping against the harsh brick behind him.<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re in luck. Give it to me and we’re good for the day…” Riley offered, encouraging the deal by raising a fist, making as if he were just about to throw a punch right at Micah’s head. “… or this is going to get ten times worse for you!”<br />
<br />
Micah clutched the coin in his hand, feeling the old Hanzi symbols embossed in ancient copper against his palms. This coin was special, he just knew it. He’d bought it at a flea market from some old coin collector because it just seemed some mysterious. He’d despise Riley for taking it away from him, but with that fist training at his face, it would be better to give it away than have his skull caved in.<br />
<br />
Micah nodded, conceding defeat as he shakily lifted the necklace off his neck, dangling the chain in his hand as he offered it up to Riley, the coin swaying.<br />
<br />
Riley just stopped.<br />
<br />
The brash bully was absolutely stupefied as his eyes fixed on the gently swaying coin, following the pendulum-like arch from left to right, left to right. His beef with Micah seemed to lose all meaning as he gazed on the tarnished copper coin gently glistening in the early morning sun.<br />
<br />
“Ugh…” Micah broke the ten seconds of silence, still holding out the coin for Riley to take, but he just wasn’t. The bully was frozen there like a statue leaving Micah precariously suspended against the wall as he began to sway the coin in his hand, watching Riley’s eyes track it in its larger arches.<br />
<br />
Wait. Was he hypnotized?<br />
<br />
Micah had thought hypnosis was make believe, but now, how could it be? The little coin stopped a raging bully in his tracks, the stronger boy held helpless by the influence of that tiny round.<br />
<br />
“Are you… hypnotized?” Micah asked out loud. “Nod. Can you nod for me?”<br />
<br />
Riley’s head slowly crept up and down like he was some sort of zombie, eyes never losing sight of the copper coin pendulating back and forth. Realizing he had the upper hand; Micah was the one smirking now.<br />
<br />
“Heh. Alright, let’s try even more.” Micah’s tone grew louder, growing more confident before he belted out an order far more substantial. “You’re going to promise to be nice to me from now on! And you’re gonna pay me back for all the milk money you stole over the past three years!”<br />
<br />
Would it work? Micah certainly hoped so. If Riley paid him back, it would be enough to buy him a PS5 and a dozen games! He waited for some sort of confirmation from the boy still pressing him against the wall; a ‘yes’ or a nod or… something. He kept swaying the coin, praying that Riley wasn’t snapping out of it. If Riley knew he had hypnotized him, he’d knock his teeth out for sure!<br />
<br />
Time seemed to pause. Nothing happened. Riley didn’t budge and the only sound he made was some sort of rumbling coming from his chest. At first it was faint but it grew louder and louder until it started to sound like a pot of boiling water. Underneath his tank top, Micah saw the bully’s skin start to blush, his chest… growing?<br />
<br />
It happened so suddenly that Micah didn’t know what happened. Riley grew, his frozen arms dragging the smaller boy another foot higher up off the ground as his angular facial features rounded, the thirteen-year-old’s flexing biceps visibly diminishing underneath a layer of smooth, soft, hairless skin. The rigid musculature he’d seen time and time again on the young wrestler began to look almost girly.<br />
<br />
Micah’s eyes darted to and fro, watching his monster of a classmate grow taller, his skin turning so soft and lush it glowed it the sunlight just like the copper coin. A stirring in Riley’s chest demanded the younger boy’s attention, Micah gaping at the sight of that tank top pushing out, fabric growing moist with sweat as two conspicuous lumps inflated just beneath.<br />
<br />
Boyish instincts captivated Micah, a confused erection pressing out against his shorts as two smaller nubs began poking harshly at the wet fabric that was just barely holding them in. Soon that tank-top turned into a sport’s bra, Riley’s belly starting to show as his shirt hiked up, revealing defined abs layered underneath a silken covering of feminine skin. Riley shuddered, his breathing quivering heavier as his calm gasps took on a gentler tenor, vocal cords softening into feminine tones as each breath heaved his growing chest higher and higher. That shirt was absolutely stuffed with tits now, the fabric straining as it fought to contain the bully’s mammaries. Those oblong protrusions of soft, sweaty tits fitfully burgeoned with every breath Riley took, inflating like party balloons as they grew to near D-sized breasts!<br />
<br />
Then they stopped. Everything stopped yet again. It was the same pause as before, but this time Riley was so much different.<br />
<br />
He was a girl now. Her body was slender yet muscular, supple skin blanketing her form that now stood a foot taller. Her chin and facial features made him distinctly female, Micah hardly able to believe his bully that had tormented him all these years now looked like one of those V-Tuber girls he’d love to watch. She appeared older too, like she’d shot passed high-school completely, looking just like one of those 18-year-old girls he’d see at high school graduation ceremonies. And he thought she was pretty too.<br />
<br />
The coin kept swaying in Micah’s hand, Riley the tomboy standing obediently still, holding Micah up against the wall the whole time. Micah remained just as quiet as she did. He was confused from brain to boner, wondering if Riley still held that hatred she had for him behind those mesmerized eyes, and more importantly, whether she’d want to go on a date with a nerdy kid like him.<br />
<br />
Or maybe. He could make her do even more….<br />
<br />
As Micah thought, a light patch of tawny peach-fuzz began growing behind Riley&#39;s back, a tiny bump jutting out of her tail bone indicating she wasn&#39;t near done changing yet.</p>
