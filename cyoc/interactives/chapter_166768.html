<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided that I was going to turn back into that boy again. It felt like I needed to experience his body once more with actual clothes for it. Something about turning into someone else but wearing my own clothes was exciting in it&#39;s own way, like a convoluted game of dress-up, but I also desired to feel as close to BEING another person, and I figured one way to do that would be to wear clothes more befitting what someone like them would actually wear.<br />
<br />
I imagine 15 or 16 year old boys aren&#39;t wandering around wearing the suits of much older, fatter men, so I instead turned to what I had acquired for teen clothing. There were some options, but I settled on something I felt was pretty neutral. A striped t-shirt, and dark blue jeans, with some boxers fit for someone with a smaller ass than I actually possessed.<br />
<br />
After setting out the clothes, I went to transform. This time, I gave myself the opportunity to watch it happen in the mirror. Standing there, looking silly in the nude except for socks and shoes, I observed my body. The rolling hills of fat in stretched skin, cellulite and stretch marks around my &quot;trouble spots&quot; or where fat tends to peak out on me before the rest of my body. My short, professional hair which was graying rapidly as I entered my mid-50&#39;s. My dull, murky brown eyes staring with a hunger, excitement and joy for what was coming shortly.<br />
<br />
It seemed only a moment after I had rolled my eyes over my detestable body that I was then witnessing it warp and compress. Before my very eyes, I saw the first changes, and perhaps the most dramatic. My stomach pulled in, as if tightening up a bundle, the skin itself seemed to become a tauter, firmer material, all the while, appearing smoother. The damage too, was melting away into nothingness. Stretch marks faded, and cellulite vanished as if they never existed. I realized, for this kids body... it never did!<br />
<br />
The fat had to go first, I realized. Had I retained it for the next part, I probably would have collapsed. My bones began to shorten, and retract into the smaller frame of a boy who still had years to grow into his body fully. My actual weight at this height and on this frame... I&#39;d have been massive, and doughy. For now, though, I looked like a shorter, leaner version of myself, with skin looking fantastic. <br />
<br />
Details were next. My face changed, not in a wave from top to bottom, or vice versa. But all together in a gradual transition. My eyes shifted several shades, as my nose pulled back and pointed a bit up, my lips thinned out, and my ears grew smaller and more fey. Color returned to my hair, and it became that sunflower shade of blond. It was unruly like before, but in a stylish way that was clearly a statement of boyish youth. The changes, all happening at once made it hard to track one specific thing, when I watched my hair change, I lost sight of my nose settling into it&#39;s current form. And likewise, after a moment my face and head was all that of the teens. <br />
<br />
I was convinced everything was settled but then I noticed a stirring in my loins. My manhood was morphing. Smaller testicles, descended, but a not unimpressive member had replaced my own. And even that was not quite the end, the details still rippled down this body. I looked and saw my fingers compressing and shortening, my neatly cut nails even shimmering before becoming hastily clipped nails. I took the time to feel the skin of my hands, and realized they were much softer than my own, as well as the rest of the bodies skin. The energy and vigor of this form returned to me, and I realized something about the transformation... Being in my own body, I had grown accustomed to a certain level of exhaustion, wear, and stress.<br />
<br />
This body, on the other hand... it was a blank slate for emotional and physical duress. And, I wagered, even if I did become injured or damaged in this body, I could return later to this body as it is now. This was the strangest part about these magic socks. It didn&#39;t just turn me into the boy, who likely was a few years older if not more now. It turns me into him as he was when he last wore those shoes. Maybe he lost them? Or maybe he got a new pair. Whatever the case, this was a transformation into not only a body... but a body in a special moment.<br />
<br />
I grinned. This was going to be fun. I put on the clothes now, and even the shoes again. I tucked the socks into a hiding place. I was determined... these socks are too important to actually wear when I&#39;m in another body. To that end, I had some basic white socks ready to wear when I got dressed. This time, standing in front of the mirror, I saw &quot;myself&quot; again.<br />
<br />
I looked the part of a young teen boy, mischievous and virile. The clothes certainly helped to make me look like a youth would, but it did occur to me as I looked up and down at his body... is this what he would have actually worn? I see his face and his body, but not what his mind or personality was. There&#39;s no make-up or piercings, so I would not assume he was a goth or punk. But what if the essence of his being is lost, because I only have the perspective of his physical form. I had exercise clothing, maybe he was more of a jock? He did have the look of a soccer player. <br />
<br />
I decided to just go with what I was wearing today. I wanted to venture out into the world and just... be someone else. To anyone who would observe me... I was this teen boy.<br />
<br />
Which then dawned on me... what should I call myself? I couldn&#39;t go around and use my real name. &quot;Edwin Findler&quot; seemed too stuffy for a kid. And I wasn&#39;t going to just go by &quot;Eddy&quot; as I always hated that nickname. No... I had to be someone else. I think I&#39;ll be a...</p>
