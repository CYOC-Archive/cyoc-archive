<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and John eat the sandwiches that Rose brought out, her snacking off her brother’s plate. You learn that they do sneak food in the back, but as it’s a health violation, they have to hide it well. You also learn that, outside of the restaurant that the mayor owns herself, their family pizza place is the only other place currently open. That was why they started selling other foods besides pizza. The mayor was sounding more and more like an ass, and the fact that your father was now working for her was worrying you. As much as he was a jerk to you at times, he was still your father. <br />
<br />
John and Rose’s parents even came out to say hi. They were nice people, glad to hear that their son had another friend that shared his “interests” in art. They admitted that they didn’t understand it but were fine with it all the same. A stark contrast to your father. <br />
<br />
You promise to pay them the next time, but they said that it would be fine and to get yourself set up with your new art gear. Apparently, they knew of John’s plan with the tablet as well. At this point, you were starting to wonder who didn’t. On the drive back to your new house with Rose, she joked that that was what small-town living was like. Everyone knows everything. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the drive, you and Rose got to learn quite a bit about each other. First, she let you off the hook for the comment about taking a swing at her. She tells you that, and John knew, all the tables can be heard from the kitchen. So, her parents heard too. This made you panic until she adds that she didn’t see you as that type of guy. You also learn that she has a thing for writing. She always wanted to write a book. You two agree that, once you get used to making comic style pages, that your first comic would co-written by her. A way to get her name out too. <br />
<br />
The two of you pull up to the house, your father still not back from his meeting with the mayor. “I am not surprised.” Rose comments as she parks her truck on the side. “She is known for being a slave driver.” <br />
<br />
“Then my dad is probably loving it. He always says that if work was too easy, then you need to leave that job and find a real one.” You reply. <br />
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but…” You cut Rose off by raising your hand.<br />
<br />
“My dad is an ass?” You finish for her. <br />
<br />
The two of you have a laugh as you open the door and invite her in properly. Inside, she looks around in awe. “Wow, this place does seem smaller on the outside. John was right.” <br />
<br />
“That is not the weirdest part.” You comment as you show her upstairs. <br />
<br />
On the way to your room, she comments on the antro wolf and fox statues outside your door. “They are pretty, almost like maids.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah. I wonder how they survived the last owners, from what I hear about them.” The two of you walk into your room, Rose closing your door behind you. She takes a seat on your bed, which was strangely made now. You could have sworn you left it a mess. You walk over to your computer, take out your new tablet and plug it in to update and download all the apps you will need. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I met them once. They came into the restaurant just to tell us that our days were numbered. They planned to bring in outside franchises to take over. Did the same to the other family business. The police had a hard time not finding a person that didn’t have a grudge against them. Well, they are gone and now you are here. So, while your stuff downloads, what do you want to do?” Rose gives you a smile, and it wasn’t hard for her to see the growing boner in your pants. <br />
<br />
You had to admit, even though you just met her, Rose was fun to be around. She had great timing with jokes or comebacks. She seemed understanding. Her tan skin, plump chest and bright green eyes were all bonuses too. “Well, I did promise not to make a one-night stand.” <br />
“Then let’s make sure this doesn’t last one night.” She replies as she walks over to you. <br />
<br />
Rose gets down to her knees right in front of you, moving her hair out of her face. She slowly unzips your pants, purposely fiddling with your briefs while bringing out your cock. With the warm air of your room touch your exposed cock, you breath in deeply as she licks her lips. She then kisses your tip before licking along your rod, tasting everything she could along the way. You couldn’t tell if she was trying to make you cum right there, or if this was just her foreplay. Slowly, she then takes your tip into her mouth, slowly going up and down on your cock. You never had head before, but this made you into a believer of it. You cock felt so warm, wrapped in her cheeks. Her tongue massage the underneath of your member, sometimes coming out and poking at your balls that were still inside your pants. Then there was the looks she gave you, telling you that she loved how you tasted. You could smell out turned on she was…<br />
<br />
Both you and Rose then stop when you both heard a ripping and popping noise. She slowly brought her mouth off your cock, her canine teeth more predominate in her mouth. As she sits back, you see that her bra had popped off, the clips on the back being torn off. Looking down, you also can now see that your balls had ripped out of your pants, your cock an inch longer and lightly thicker.  <br />
<br />
“What the hell? I just bought this one.” Rose says, picking up her bra. Sitting back on her legs, she then sees your balls and cock new size. “You weren’t that big before, were you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think you were either.” You pointed to her shirt, her nipples now showing tightly against it. <br />
<br />
Rose’s eyes widened, as she realized that her areola had grown too. She raises her hands to them, feeling their new weight. “No, I wasn’t. What is happing?” <br />
<br />
Before you could answer, both of you got a whiff of the other’s scent. The two of your eyes glaze over as Rose returns to your cock. She resumes giving you head, that warm feeling returning to your cock. She goes as deep as she can, the pleasure becoming unthinkable to the both of you. <br />
<br />
As her mouth goes up and down on your cock, it slowly continued to change. Dark fur covered your balls as they grow slightly more. The skin around your cock pulls back, forming a sheath that gets covered in the same dark, almost brown fur. Your rod thickens some more as your tip becomes pointed. Then the sheath seemed to expand some, something in it growing. Rose lets out a moan that vibrates your changing cock, causing the now plump knot to slowly grow out of the sheath and into her mouth. You couldn’t hold back any longer, as you released your seed into her waiting mouth. <br />
<br />
She slurps it up, not letting any leave her lips. She stays there for about a minute, drinking like a straw. When you are empty for the moment, she leans back, two new rows of smaller breasts now visible under her shirt. There is also a visible wet spot between her legs, her cumming too. <br />
<br />
The two of you shake your heads as both of you come out of your haze. “What the fuck was that?” You say before looking over to Rose. “God, Rose. I am so sorry!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be, that was the plan to begin with.” She reassures you before moving her hands over her new breasts. “But what is with this?” Her eyes then widen. “Could it be the house?” <br />
<br />
“It could be. Lets get out of here.” You stand up, your cock sliding into its new sheath. The sheath hangs out of the opening of your pants, your balls dangling between your legs, rubbing against your jeans. Rose stands too, with your help, and the two of you make your way down the stairs. As you reach the bottom, you hear something coming from the living room. “If that is my dad, we got to tell him.” <br />
<br />
Rose reluctantly agreed, even in her new state. You two run into the living room, seeing your father standing between the two couches. “Oh, son. I see you found yourself a girl. Not bad. You are finally making progress.” <br />
<br />
You could see that his shirt and pants fit him worse then last night, the buttons of the business flannel barely holding on, and his pants zipper being pulled apart. “Dad, we need to get out of the house!” <br />
<br />
“Why son?” He replies with a big grin. His shirt starts to pull apart as he speaks, “This is the best house we had ever…”</p>
