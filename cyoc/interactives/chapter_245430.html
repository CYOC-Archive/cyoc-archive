<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer quickly picked up on her new family dynamics, she had three sisters, Brittany, Lexi, and Serene. Each one had a different coloring of feathers too, Brittany a cool blue and grey, Lexi either a light red or pink, it was hard to say, again with a grey contrast, and Serene had soft white feathers. While each had their own quirks it quickly became apparent that they all shared their love for teasing and playing jokes on each other. Brittany was older than Jennifer, probably nineteen or twenty if she had to guess, she was slightly taller too and much more filled out, her hips and breasts curving her dress out. Serene looked to be about the same age as Jennifer, given the similar monochromatic coloring it was probably save to assume they close when they were born, er, hatched? She seemed the most quite, for a harpy atleast. Lexi was the youngest easily, she was a few inches shorter than Jennifer and a untamed chaotic bundle of energy and feathers. Jennifer blushed, she was also the one who riffled into her dress earlier and caused her to have an egg. Jennifer pushed the memory out of her mind, in fear of causing another one to form.<br />
<br />
After breakfast the quad formed by the front door. Jennifer looking around as her sisters all got ready. Brittany reached out with her talon as she grabbed the doors handle, which was positioned near the bottom for ease like everything else. A gust of wind made Jennifer wings shoot out instinctually. Jennifer watched as her sisters all starting to leap out, their bodies catching the draft as they disappeared. Jennifer slowly stepped to the edge and froze. It was easily a 20ft drop, her neighborhood turned into a line of houses well elevated from the earth below, but still stylized like a normal suburban street, it was a weird mixture of designs for effectively a tree house.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was scared, but knew she&#39;d have to leave, she held her breath as she took a step off. And immediately started to fall. &quot;Shit!&quot; Jennifer yelped as she really has expected some sort of instincts to kick in, her wings were flapping wildly as she spun around, the ground rapidly approaching. Jennifer closed her eyes as the wind grew calmer, opening them again she saw herself gliding like she had in the house, her descent much more slower. Jennifer gasped as the adrenaline had worn off. Giving a few brisk flaps of her arms she found she could start to climb up again. &quot;Oh my god I&#39;m flying? I&#39;m actually flying!&quot; It was a scene from a dream, and in those few seconds she had almost completely forgotten the curse or her situation.<br />
<br />
Increasing her speed she tried to catch up with her sisters. After a minute she matched their speeds and joined the formation. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes Jennifer could see the neighborhood change, the forested area giving way to a more than typical town. Jennifer could see each type of creature below her, each with their own neighborhood styles, from beastman, to seafolk, the scenery was always changing.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Jennifer while she was caught in her wanderlust. Lexi flapped dexterously over and around Brittany, whispering in her ear. A sly grin stretching across both their faces as they drifted swiftly and quietly over Jennifer. <br />
<br />
In a swift motion the pair forced Jennifer down as she jumped, snapping from her daydreaming. &quot;What are you guys doing?&quot; She tried to yank free, the girls weight forcing her to glide to the ground. The pair were just laughing as all three landed with a thud. Jennifer pushed on her back as she tried to spin around and take off again. <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked around, they landed somewhere still in a grassy and wooded area, it didn&#39;t look apart of the town at all. Jennifers face snapped back as Brittany fell on top of her, her face meeting her sisters groin if it wasn&#39;t for the few inches of the dress in the way. &quot;Woah, Jen, you just really seem out of it today.&quot; Brittany whispered in a sultry voice. &quot;That&#39;s two for two today, and now mom&#39;s not here to save you.&quot; The two laughed in unison, Jennifer looking up to see Serene circling around the trio. Lexi&#39; voice was heard behind Brittany. &quot;Told you she wouldn&#39;t notice, she&#39;s too much of a birdbrain today or something.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer tried to kick in the air, her shoes slipping off without resistance as she let go of the bar inside. She couldn&#39;t see where she was at, and her body was still pinned by Brittany. &quot;Do you remember last week?&quot; Lexi replied as she hopped around Brittanys form, her face looking down at Jennifers. Jennifer tried to shake her head, her voice muffled between Brittanys thighs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do.&quot; Lexi retorted. &quot;You made me have an egg right infront of all my friends. It was like, so embarrassing.&quot; Lexi frowned. &quot;I told you I&#39;d get revenge, and now it looks like I have my turn.&quot; Jennifer tried to thrash more and she watched Serene circle in and land. &quot;You&#39;re little accident at breakfast makes me think you&#39;re still worked up, did you see a human recently or something?&quot; Lexi laughed. &quot;In any case let&#39;s see how long you can hold a trance!&quot; All three let out a laugh. Jennifer flapping her wings trying to get Serenes attention. Seeing her move Jennifer initially though she was coming to help. That changed however when she felt her dress flip up. Jennifers legs tried to kick but were held down by Lexi as she felt Serenes tongue begin to trace around her pussy. Much like her personality, Serenes tongue was soft and gentle, the mild warmth spreading out as she continued. Jennifer let out a moan, why did it feel so good?<br />
<br />
Serene picked up the pace, Jennifers hips flexing in response. She could hear the girls talking over her, Lexi remarking snarkly. &quot;Look I&#39;m telling yea if she had a egg from just touching her, an orgasm will put in her a egg trance for sure!&quot; Jennifers will to protest was waning with every lick and lather. After a few minutes Jennifer felt the weight leave her as her body shuddered in bliss. Serene standing up as she wiped her mouth with the edge of her wing. All three standing over her as Jennifer wallowed in her afterglow. Then the feeling returned, Jennifers head peered up as she looked down her body, her stomach starting to rise again as the warmth grew and started to solidify in her womb. Lexi was enjoying herself too much as she was cackling, falling over to her side in a balling laughter. Her sisters smiling too, a perfect harpy prank executed without flaw. Jennifer moaned as her stomach rose like a inflating balloon. Just like before, after a few minutes Jennifer&#39;s stomach was huge again and with a wince, a pressure surround her groin as she felt the egg start to pass. &quot;W-why?&quot; Jennifer croaked out, begging for sympathy. Brittany just smiled. &quot;Wow Jen, if you&#39;re packing these many eggs maybe Mom should just send you to the egg farm.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer shook her head as the egg slipped free. &quot;The egg farm?&quot; Her second sentence cut off as she felt her stomach start the process again. Brittany leaned down as she rubbed Jennifers bare stomach as it grew. &quot;Yup, the other monsters love eating harpy eggs, some humans too I hear. Some harpies love laying eggs so much they spend all day locked up making eggs.&quot; Jennifers stomach quivered at the soft feeling of her sisters feathers, her voice sounded like she was talking about a myth or some haunted house. Jennifer rocked her hips as the feeling grew in her stomach as she looked down, her stomach growing even larger than before, she looked nine months pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey look she&#39;s got twins.&quot; Lexi pointed out, nudging Serene. &quot;That&#39;s good luck.&quot; Jennifer breathed quickly as two eggs pushed themselves out back to back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at that, I mention the egg farm and you get two eggs, you must really want to go.&quot; Brittany whispered, her tongue letting out a roll across Jennifer&#39;s ear. Jennifers mind was already weak, that enough causing another egg to begin to form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, we gotta get to school you know, it would be a shame if we were late.&quot; Brittany said as her sisters cawed. &quot;But hey, if you&#39;re still here after school we&#39;ll make sure to bring some water or something to make you stop.....if we remember!&quot; The trio laughed again as they began to take off. Jennifer trying to move after them, but her stomach wouldn&#39;t let her as it surged again. &quot;N-no.&quot; Jennifer said breathlessly. &quot;I gotta stop, I gotta....&quot; Jennifer grunted as the egg crowned, the sensation already causing the next egg to form. Jennifer remembered her mother&#39;s words, it could go on for hours. Jennifer tried to think about other things, but passing a ham sized egg was something you just couldn&#39;t ignore. She would be stuck here for a little while longer.</p>
