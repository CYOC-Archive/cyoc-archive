<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Logan and Allison held hands, giggling despite themselves at what had transpired on the &quot;court&quot;. They both were saddened that this new stage in their relationship would prevent them from ever being truly competitive with one another again, but as Allison submissively rested her head on Logan&#39;s shoulder as they ascended the stairs into Logan&#39;s bedroom, she was glad that she got something so much better instead. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Logan locked her door and stood in front of Allison, sitting cutely on Logan&#39;s bed, as Logan began to undress, removing her top, her sneakers, her socks, and her pants. <br />
<br />
Allison saw Logan in all her butch glory, looking like a woman below the neck, a woman that either would have banged furiously before this great change, approach her and grab Allison by the shirt collars. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get off those clothes and let me ravish you!&quot; she domineered with a grin on her face.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Sabrina Carter grinned. Her new role as a jobs counselor looked like it would be indeed making bank. Not only was the world changing, but so were people. <br />
<br />
She was reading an article about how, since the Great Change, numerous new women who had once shied away from hobbies or professions seen as &quot;girly&quot; or effeminate were now no longer shamed into avoiding their interests. For instance, among all the numerous high profile news stories that were coming out about the turbulent political climate and the seeming end of climate change, one of the more minor stories was about how the NFL was undergoing a massive transformation of its own. Many major league stars like Russell Wilson and Cam Newton to name just two had quit the game to pursue being fashion models and pop stars, both of them already being richer than Croesus and unable to man the gridiron seeing as they were no longer beefy men but skinny as a rake buxom women. Other footballers were switching sides and joining the cheerleading team. Likewise, many born women cheerleaders, who had been football fans their entire lives but were unable to play, now wanted to wear the colors and throw pigskin themselves. One minor football player on the Seattle Seahawks was forced to take an early retirement. She was pregnant. No word on who the other mother was. <br />
<br />
These high profile stories didn&#39;t effect Sabrina&#39;s bottom line. She was treating average folk like herself who had either been displaced, or had been elderly but magically rejuvenated. Still, it gave her optimism. Hope springs eternal, and there&#39;s opportunity under every rock.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
As Robbie pondered her increasingly insatiable sexual hunger, Elizabeth woke up. She moaned lowly for five minutes, still in total ecstasy over the best fuck she had had in years. Robbie smiled, glad to have been of service, glad to have made her wife happy again, and approached her. Robbie began to stroke Elizabeth&#39;s blonde hair while she was in bed, her breasts pulsating up and down, up and down, up and...<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you like being a lesbian?&quot; asked Robbie.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth breathed out really hard. &quot;It rocks. It&#39;s really a different experience from fucking as man and wife, but I could easily get used to this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Robbie hopefully. &quot;Or are you just saying that because you&#39;re still high for all the orgasms?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth pondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I do really, really want things to go back to the way they were, but if we had sex like this regularly, I could see myself embracing my inner L word. How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie said &quot;I can tell you from experience. Fucking as a woman, especially one with my sex drive, EASILY, EASILY beats fucking as a guy. I mean, when I orgasmed, I orgasmed throughout my entire body. My entire self went electric. I didn&#39;t just feel pleasure in one part of my body, I felt it everywhere, and honestly, I don&#39;t think I could have felt it that way with anyone else but you, love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth cutely grinned, still laying down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, babe&quot; she said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s just one thing&quot; said Robbie. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t be the dominant one all the time. I used to not mind it. I used to always be the aggressor because I was the man and I figured that I was the one in charge. It just felt natural, you know? But now that I&#39;m a little girl, and we&#39;re both girls, I think we need a more equal partnership. Give and take. Sometimes I&#39;m the one in the lead, and sometimes you are. I know that you&#39;re struggling, but I can help you along, Liz. I can help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth said &quot;I guess I can do it if you help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking that we could introduce a little roleplaying in our sex life&quot; suggested Robbie with an innocent tone of voice, already visualizing herself what she wanted to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking that I could be dressed up like Little Red Riding Hood, and you could be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t say your grandmother&quot; joked Elizabeth, to which Robbie grinned again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You could be the Big Sexy Wolf that tries to devirginize me&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck with that&quot;. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth thought back, hazily remembering seeing an old Friar&#39;s Club celebrity roast with Dean Martin a long time ago. He said something along the lines of &quot;She did the Dance of the Virgins...from memory&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously. I want to play a sweet, little, innocent virgin girl, and I want you to be the evil she-wolf. Can you do that for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cell phone rang. Liz&#39;s phone. She picked it up. Robbie saw her roll her eyes. She then hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of all the inopportune times. Billie is ready to be picked up from the Stafford&#39;s. I&#39;m...I&#39;m in no mood. Robbie, could you pick her up for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Jenna Negrotti, the principle of the elementary school that Millie taught at and Juliana worked at, was enjoying a casual Saturday off in front of the boob tube. She was sitting crosslegged on her couch, eating a big bowl of risotto and catching up on Stranger Things, which had heard so many good things about but hadn&#39;t had the time to watch until just now. Like many young people of her generation, she tended to binge watch TV shows all in one gulp, and Jenna was actually pretty good at processing so much disparate information being thrown at her.  She was all alone, and the house was quiet. She knew that it was odd, especially for a woman that had already been thoroughly attractive even before the Great Change, but she liked it this way. Jenna was an introvert by nature, and didn&#39;t really need a girlfriend for now. The loud smacks of rice against her teeth permeated the room.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Greta stared into space.<br />
<br />
&quot;This ring. It&#39;s powered by gods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jean.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw gods, and I saw women. I saw sorceresses. This ring is powered by magic, we always knew that, but up until now, I never questioned where that magic came from, and now I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what should we do now?&quot; asked Jean, worried that her trip to Disneyland would be cut short.<br />
<br />
Greta sighed. &quot;I want to meet them, but I don&#39;t want all of this power stripped from me. What do you think I should do, Jean?&quot; she asked, turning to her lover for advice.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Shelly cried into her mother&#39;s clothes for what felt like hours, but was actually only a few minutes. She finally looked up, and saw a young woman with pin straight light brown hair and the face of someone like an angel. She couldn&#39;t believe it was her father. She looked so young. Maybe about the same age as Shelly when she had been kidnapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t altered your room one bit since it happened&quot; her father said. &quot;We just knew that this day would come when we&#39;d find you. We don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the Great Change that did it, but I&#39;ll stop thanking God or whatever angel led us to finding you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears were in her father&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Gary was equally stunning. Shelly couldn&#39;t believe it. They had dated in high school a decade ago, and the woman standing here right in front of her would have easily been the most sought after girl in that school. She was wearing a very fashionable multicolored dress that went up to her thighs. Her thighs were glistening even in this gloomy police waiting room. Her hair was done rasta style, and her face had a smile that could warm the coldest heart. She still had pictures of them before the kidnapping, and before the Great Change in her purse.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I have to tell you why my parents and I are estranged, OK?&quot; asked Millie, suddenly getting very emotional. She put her head down, staring at the ants on the sidewalk. Juliana consoled her new lover with a friendly back rub. <br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, you can tell me anything. If we&#39;re going to be wifeys, if we&#39;re going to be soulmates, there&#39;s nothing that we should keep from each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie smiled warmly even though Juliana couldn&#39;t see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make life make so much more sense, do you know that? OK, here it goes: My dad molested me a lot when I was younger, up until I was twelve, and my mother was a total enabler. She revealed nothing until I forced her to in public at a supermarket when we were grocery shopping together. My dad went to jail, got out early, got treatment, and he claims that he&#39;s reformed now, but I CAN&#39;T believe that. I can&#39;t, and even if it&#39;s true, I don&#39;t know how I could face him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie looked up at Juliana. &quot;I think that&#39;s why I was so scared about kids before. Because I was afraid that I&#39;d end up like my father.&quot;</p>
