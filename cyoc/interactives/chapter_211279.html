<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had never been to a high school party before, but a whole bunch of people made sure that the person they thought was Emily knew about the party on Friday night.  Apparently parties were kicking up a notch as senior year was coming to a close, and everyone who was anyone was going to be there.<br />
<br />
After two weeks as his mom and a week or so as Emily, Jeff had a good idea by now of how to put on makeup.  So he dolled himself up and, frankly, looked great.  Emily&#39;s underwear drawer was filled with more beige and boring bras and panties than Jeff had hoped, but there was still some good stuff in there, and for this party he decided to go with a matching red bra and panty set, the only silk underwear Emily owned.  He still really loved wearing a bra and panties and looking hot, but he also made a mental note to go shopping soon.  He put on a revealing black shirt that showed a good amount of cleavage, and tight jeans that accentuated Emily&#39;s shapely midsection.  He wasn&#39;t sure if that was too slutty, but he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s parents would never approve this kind of party, but Jeff found out through Emily&#39;s diary that she routinely snuck out to parties through her bedroom window.  Sure enough, it was easy to grab onto a tree branch, drop to the ground, and jog a few houses down to where Emily&#39;s friends were waiting to pick him up.  Jeff squeezed into the back seat, and off to the party they went.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t really know what to do at the party, so he followed the lead of Emily&#39;s friends.  Contrary to the movies he&#39;d seen, mostly they just talked to people.  Jeff recognized most of the people at the party, even if he didn&#39;t know them personally, as most of them were seniors and a lot cooler than him.  Jeff followed the other girls to the keg and filled up a cup.  A couple of bigger dudes who Jeff thought were on the football team were there and started talking to the girls.  They seemed to know Emily pretty well, so Jeff went along with the conversation.  Eventually one of the dudes, a guy named Kyle, cornered Jeff away from the other girls.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I heard you&#39;re willing to be in a threesome.  If you&#39;re interested, me and Marco totally would.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t know what to say to that.  Maybe Emily actually had been in a threesome before.  Maybe she had just said she&#39;d be interested in it.  Maybe it was just another cruel high school rumor.  He had no idea.  On the other hand, Jeff had had casual sex with three different dudes while in his mom&#39;s body, so it&#39;s not like he had a huge moral issue against having wild sex in a girl&#39;s body.  So he decided to respond honestly: &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed to be enough for Kyle, but Jeff decided to go wander around the party a bit and see if he knew anyone else there.  Sure enough, he saw his best friend Tyler.  &quot;Oh shit, Tyler, I didn&#39;t expect to see you here,&quot; he said, forgetting he didn&#39;t look like himself for a moment.<br />
<br />
Tyler reacted differently than Jeff had ever seen.  &quot;Uh, hi... hi Emily,&quot; he said.  &quot;Uh, yeah, I, uh, I got invited here.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jeff was confused as to why Tyler sounded like a fucking idiot, and then it hit him: Tyler must have a crush on Emily.  Or at least he was intimidated by her.  Jeff was still coming to terms with being able to intimidate people now that he was in Emily&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to play it cool.  &quot;Well, good to see you, Tyler,&quot; he said.  &quot;Hey, Jeff&#39;s not here, is he?&quot;  Jeff had zero desire to see his old body at this party, even if he had used the Chronivac so his sister had no recollection of the body switching and just thought she was Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jeff&#39;s not here,&quot; Tyler said.  &quot;Jeff is... Jeff&#39;s at home, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily was sympathetic to Tyler being so nervous around a hot girl, but he also couldn&#39;t really continue a conversation like this.  He excused himself and went outside.<br />
<br />
Then he got tapped on the shoulder, hard.  &quot;Hey,&quot; he heard a stern female voice say.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned around.  It was Lily Derthick, who Jeff knew was a cheerleader.  She was really hot, and for some reason she was really mad.  &quot;So I hear you&#39;re trying to fuck Kyle,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jeff again didn&#39;t know how to take that.  Was Lily dating Kyle?  He tried to remember.  Was she just interested in him?  He decided to just respond vaguely but honestly again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to do anything,&quot; he said. &quot;Kyle told me he and Marco want to have a threesome with me.  When he told me that, I left.  I&#39;m not trying to start anything with you.  Or anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Lily.  &quot;You better not.  I always knew you were a skank.&quot;  She walked away.<br />
<br />
Jeff was confused.  What the hell.  This party was more complicated than he expected.  He decided to go back and find Emily&#39;s friends again, but then he wondered if he actually should make the night more interesting.</p>
