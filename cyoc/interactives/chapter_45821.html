<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, what the hell, he thought. Honesty is the best policy, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Brian,&quot; said John, looking him in the eye, &quot;I do think you're hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian smiled up at him, then looked away shyly. &quot;I think we're both hot in here. I'm going to take my shirt off.&quot;<br />
<br />
He started to get to his feet and John automatically reached out a hand to help him up. Brian took it. He stood up but held on, squeezing tightly. Brian smiled again, then abruptly let go and started unbuttoning his shirt from the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me, uh, help you with those,&quot; said John, reaching down and undoing the lowest button. Brian's shirt was tucked into his pants and there was, he realized, another button further down. OK, he thought, be cool. He pulled the shirt up a little and then, very gently, edged his fingers down into Brian's pants, following the shirt seam. Down, down, over the... bulge, down, and there it was. He undid the button. Brian inhaled sharply. John slid his fingers back out, caressing Brian's erection through the underwear as he went. OK, he thought, scratch &quot;Brian is not gay&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once they were out, John trailed his fingertips up the front of Brian's shirt. There were still a couple of buttons left -- he undid one, Brian the other, and their fingers brushed in the middle. He stared at them and then, hesitantly, slid his hands under the shirt, across Brian's smooth skin, and around to his sides. I am holding him tenderly, he thought dreamily. He looked up as Brian stepped closer and leaned in. I am holding him tenderly and now he is going to kiss me.<br />
<br />
And he did.<br />
<br />
They parted after a moment and Brian stepped back, tugging at his shirt. The spell lifted a little and John felt some self-awareness returning. He watched as Brian twisted gracefully to pull his arms out of the sleeves. He wasn't buff exactly, but there was enough muscle there to ripple as he moved. My God, thought John, he's beautiful. How did I not notice before? He was aroused -- very aroused -- but more than that, he felt admiration, tenderness. He felt protective. He wanted to hold Brian, and be held, and stay like that forever. It was a world away from what he'd felt at the bowling alley. Am I in love, he wondered? His erection pressed uncomfortably against his jeans, distracting him, and he adjusted his stance, wiggling it upright. Did I want this without realizing it? Is this why we became room-mates?<br />
<br />
The shirt was on the floor now. He lifted his hand to Brian's chest, running his fingers through the light coat of fine, blonde hair, then teasing his thumb across a nipple. Brian returned the favour, pressing his palm against John's T-shirt then rubbing his chest, side to side, brushing over his erect nipples. It sent a tingling shiver down his front and his cock twitched, pressing up against his belly button. John stroked the side of Brian's face with his other hand, feeling the stubble rub against him. He--<br />
<br />
Wait. Pressing up against his belly button?<br />
<br />
His dick was just plain not that long, even fully erect. And yet there it was, running up past his belt and under his shirt. Now he was aware of it, it felt constricted, pinned tightly against his stomach -- and that was not helping matters. He shifted his legs and it inched up a little further. His balls slid against his legs as he moved and those too were not where they were supposed to be -- they were almost down at mid-thigh.<br />
<br />
Oh shit. It seemed to be triggered by sex, he remembered. And this was likely to qualify very shortly -- at least, it would have, were he not about to turn into a monster. Fuck.<br />
<br />
Brian must have noticed when he adjusted himself -- he raised an eyebrow at John, looked down at his crotch, then slowly walked his hands down the T-shirt towards it. He did a double-take when he reached John's stomach and found the head of his cock, wrapping his fingers around it through the fabric in surprise and then running them all the way down to the base, as though to check that what he felt was real. This time he raised both eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Impressive. And there I was thinking I was the hot one.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slid his hands back up, but this time want under John's untucked T-shirt, cupping them around the top of his dick. His fingers were cool, and the contrast against the hot flesh was intense, exquisite.<br />
<br />
Brian brought his face up against John's so that their cheeks were almost touching, keeping his hands in place all the while.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; he murmured, &quot;it's time your shirt came off.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, thought John desperately, terrible idea. My penis is turning green under your hands. This will not lead anywhere good. He squeezed his eyes shut tight and braced himself as he felt Brian take hold of the sides of his shirt.</p>
