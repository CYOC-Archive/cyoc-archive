<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nergal and Louis-Gaston stood on either side of the new Devil, right outside the gates of Dis. This was going to be the key moment both knew it.<br />
<br />
“Release King Lucifer and I promise we will show mercy.” Stated the general whose forces now surrounded the Capital. <br />
<br />
In total a force of 6 legions of hell now surrounded Dis and from Nergal’s report more legions had major cities in the 1st-4th levels surrounded. Sadly, the revolution had failed to take any cities in the 7th level. However the 8th and the 6th were totally under their control but if they lost Dis then the revolution would be as good as over. <br />
<br />
Luckily the general before them was a known force and Nergal was convinced he could turn him. When that happened, the whole army would be theirs along with Hell as a whole.<br />
<br />
“I am the King now and I demand you return to your bases and stand down, we are putting an end to the reign of the crazed king Lucifer who passed a raciest….” Started Tammuz<br />
<br />
“He didn’t.” snapped the General “My own son and daughter where among the guards who he sent to force the senators to meet again to end that hateful law by enforcing it on them.”<br />
<br />
“Shit.” Thought Nergal “that wasn’t good.”<br />
<br />
“You have a case against the Senators but not our King, that is why if you lay down your arms none will be harmed.” Countered the General<br />
<br />
“This was going to take longer then Nergal thought it would, but while the general had not put any blame on Lucifer for passing the law it was clear that the law was unpopular even with him.” Thought Nergal “He could use that; it would just take more time.”<br />
<br />
Inside the Palace, King Lucifer and Queen Lilith lay side by side in a cell, a glowing seal on their foreheads keeping them unconscious.<br />
Or that is what the guards thought.<br />
<br />
Lilith was the queen of Witchcraft and Lucifer was not lacking in the magic department by much. That rather advance spell was child’s play to them.<br />
<br />
Both of them opened their eyes and looked at each other before nodding their heads. With a flick of their fingers a portal opened up below them causing them to fall down.<br />
<br />
“ALARM!” yelled the nearest guard but the portal closed before they could see what level of Hell they had gone to.<br />
<br />
In truth they had not gone to a level in hell, not a known level at least.<br />
<br />
For everyone knew there where 9 circles of hell, in truth there was 10.<br />
<br />
The 10th level known only to Lucifer and Lilith acted like a bunker but a bunker they could strike back from. Pushing away their grief from the lost of their children they had to retake their home before it was too late.<br />
<br />
“General, maybe Lucifer didn’t pass the law and maybe he only began to move against it after it was passed but he was the one who didn’t pay enough attention to prevent it from coming up in the 1st place.” Argued Nergal “He has failed in his duties to the people.”<br />
<br />
“You have seen the state of Dis, have you not, how the people live like rats…” started Louis-Gaston<br />
<br />
“Another fault of the elites, Lucifer’s hand was forced.” Countered the General, but not as forcefully Nergal noted with a grin. <br />
<br />
“Yes…this would take time but it was within reach.” Thought Nergal.<br />
<br />
Then it went very far out of his reach.<br />
<br />
Screams and shouts could be heard from within the walls of Dis as everyone turned toward the city gates which were only a few feet away. What they saw was a total surprise to everyone. Coming out of the ground beside everyone where magical handcuffs with chains attached. They were forcing everyone to the ground. <br />
<br />
“What the?” asked Nergal as he and Tammuz stepped within the walls only to have golden restraints shot out of the ground and take them. They were forced to their knees as more restraints locked their legs in place and even a gag appeared in their mouths.<br />
<br />
“General.” Said a voice Nergal knew all to well, his eyes widened even if he couldn’t see behind him because of the restraints.<br />
<br />
“My King.” Said the general full of respect.<br />
<br />
“Retake my city and place this one in custody.” Ordered the Devil likely pointing at Louis-Gaston who was out there alone now. “My wife is controlling the magic and everyone who enters without our permission will be restrained. I want no one harmed for what they did while wrong was for the right thing. Inform all levels of what happened and that my daughter’s foolish law will be voided those behind the rebellion and the law will be punished, new protections and rights will be decided by a grand council from all the levels that will be voted on by every demon be there high born or low, human born or demon born. Things will and have to change.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my King.” confirmed the General as Lucifer walked through the gates into view of Nergal and the other leaders. <br />
<br />
Nergal had never seen the devil so angry but the worse thing was that he didn’t say anything to them, he just stood there as the soldiers began to retake the city. Dis was back in Lucifer’s hand and with that the Rebellion and all he planned to use it for was likely over as well.</p>
