<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dinner Sarah told you to wait while she talked with a few people. You started wondering if you would receive more training tonight. You also wondered what would be required of you as the daughter of the Head Council. You still find it hard to really accept that you're a girl now. You keep thinking that you'll wake up and find that this was just a dream.<br />
<br />
Sarah comes up to you and says &quot;I've finally been able to get you a dresser and wardrobe. They will be in your room when we arrive. I want you to change out of your dress and into some casual clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want me to do that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next part of your training could ruin what you have on now&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You follow Sarah back to your room. When she stops outside she says &quot;I'll wait for you out here. Now hurry up and get changed. Make sure that you change your underwear too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say then mist into your room.<br />
<br />
You start to wonder what your training would consist of that you would need to change your clothes, even your underwear. You shrug your shoulders and figure that you'll find out soon enough. You look around and notice that a dresser and wardrobe had been delivered to your room. Figuring that your casual clothes would be in the dresser you go on over to it. You open up the drawers to see what you have in there. You end up picking out a pair of pink cotton panties, a pink<br />
bra, a pink tee, a pair of short shorts, and a pair of sandals that you found next to the dresser. You feel a little sad at the thought of having to take of your dress but you didn't want to make Sarah mad. As you changed you again started to wonder what was coming. What could your training consist of that you would have to change your<br />
clothes? Is Sarah going to teach you how to hunt? That would make sense. After you finish changing you mist out of your room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me&quot; Sarah said when she saw you. She turned and walked down the hall away from the doors to upstairs.<br />
<br />
This puzzled you so you ask &quot;Are you going to teach me to hunt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you have me change?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
At the end of the hall is another set of stairs leading down to another level. Sarah heads down them and you follow. At the bottom is another hall with several doors set in the walls. Sarah heads to one door and stops before it.<br />
<br />
When you stop Sarah says &quot;Open the door and go inside Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
You open the door and step inside. As soon as you're inside you hear a whooshing sound as an arrow buries itself into your chest. It pierces your heart and you think that this is it, you're dead. Then you remember that Sarah had said that the only way for you to die would be to starve. You collapse to the floor and begin to wonder if Sarah was lying to you about that. You can't move your body or your eyes, you can't breath, and you feel your bladder and bowels empty like you had died. You were expecting your vision to fade to black but<br />
that didn't happen.<br />
<br />
Sarah came into your field of vision and said &quot;I know you can here and see me. No doubt you have some questions for me. I'll try to answer them. First I'd imagine that you think I lied to you about starving is the only way we die. I didn't lie to you about that. This is to teach you what it's like to be staked. You feel like you died because the wood disrupts the energy flow through your chakras as well as the flow of blood. You can still see, feel, and hear in<br />
this state but to someone looking at you, you appear to be dead. Once we remove the arrow the wound will close and you will once again be able to move. First though we'll chop off your head. This will teach you what it's like to have a part of your body separate from the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
A big male vampire carried you over to a table and laid you down on it making sure that your hair was laid above you. He went off to one side and then returned with a big, double bladed ax. The ax looked heavy and sharp as this guy held it so you could see it. He then positioned the ax over your throat and then lifted it up over his head. The next thing you see is the ax coming down. You hear a whoosh as the ax cuts cleanly through your neck. You feel the pain a second later. The guy grabs your head and hands it to Sarah. It's a strange feeling having your head separated from your body. You can still feel your body and your soiled panties but it seems to be a bit distant. It's like your whole body was given a shot of novacaine but it<br />
only numbed it a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know what it's like to be staked and have your head chopped off&quot; Sarah said looking into your eyes as she held your head in her hands. &quot;Ok Sam, you can take the arrow out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel Sam tugging on the arrow embedded into your body. It eventually came free and you feel the wound where it was close up. Once it did you could breath again and move your eyes. Your head was still separated from your body and you tried to ask Sarah about it. Even though you moved your mouth no sound came out. You realize that even though you were breathing you weren't doing so through your nose or mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're being silly Violet&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You should have known that you wouldn't be able to talk with your head separated from your body. Now you can move your body and you can sense it and what's around it. Make your body walk over here and put your head back on.&quot;<br />
<br />
You do as Sarah said. You feel your body get up off the table and started to walk to Sarah. You sensed that Sam stepped in front off your body and went around him. You finally get your body to Sarah and grabbed your head. You place you head on your shoulders and feel the cut close. Once your head was firmly attached to your body once again<br />
you're able to feel your body fully again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I know why you wanted me to change&quot; you say. &quot;This shirt is ruined, my panties are full of shit and soaked with piss, even my shorts are wet with piss. This is gross. I need to get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right on that&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Go back to your room and take a bath. Go ahead and throw your clothes in the trash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to escort me to my room?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know were it is&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I need to talk with Sam about a few things. I'll stop by a little later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say and leave. As you walk you feel really uncomfortable with your panties full of shit. You'll be glad when you get to your room. Your tempted to mist all the way there but you haven't seen anyone going from place to place in mist form. Everyone seemed to walk except when they enter or exit their rooms. You decided to follow their example and walk, at least until you knew all the rules around here. You get to your room and mist inside.<br />
<br />
Once you are inside you head straight for the bathroom. You strip as soon as you enter. Once you had striped down to nothing you toss your clothes into a trash bag and tie it shut. You then wipe the shit off your ass. You decide that a bath would be a good idea. While the tub was filling you look at yourself in a full length mirror. You look at<br />
yourself closely and notice that you don't have any body hair anywhere on your body. You find this odd since you should have some pubic hair at least. You have either b or c cup breasts so you have entered puberty. Of course you don't know what puberty is like for a vampire. You decide to ask Sarah about this.<br />
<br />
You turn and see that your bath is full. You turn off the water and step in. The water feels so good and your starting to feel a little relaxed. You wash your body and hair while enjoying the feeling of the water against your more sensitive skin and breasts. You start to wonder what it was like for females to have an orgasm. You're just sitting in the tub having finished washing yourself. Your hand slides to your genitals and you start rubbing. You find your clit and start<br />
rubbing it as you let out a low moan. You decide to put your fingers in your pussy so you do while continuing to rub your clit. You moan a little louder and continue to pleasure yourself. After several minutes, during which your moans grew louder, you feel like you're close to orgasm. You speed up a bit and soon you're having your first female orgasm. You feel your vagina spasm and an intense feeling spread throughout your entire body. This was better than a male orgasm in your mind. After you have finished your orgasm you get out of the tub and drain the water. You grab a couple of towels and wrap your hair in one and wrap the other one around yourself.<br />
<br />
You head back into your bedroom to find clothes. You think about putting your dress back on when Sarah mists in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you cleaned yourself up&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now it's getting close to your bedtime. There is a silk nightgown in the wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a couple of questions Sarah&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are they?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't I have any pubic or other body hair?&quot; you ask. &quot;I mean I have b or c cup breasts so I should have some body hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of us have any body hair&quot; Sarah said. &quot;It's part of being a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen vampires with beards and mustaches&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can grow facial hair and our hair grows too&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you seem like you don't know your breast size&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Your breasts are a c cup. What was your second question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen everybody walking around here&quot; you say. &quot;Is there a rule or something that says we can't mist everywhere we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no rule against it&quot; Sarah said, &quot;but everybody is encouraged to walk. Now where is the trash bag? I'll take it with me when I leave and dispose of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's in the bathroom&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready and go to bed&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Sarah leaves after getting the trash from the bathroom. You dry your hair with a hair drier you found in a drawer in the dresser with the mirror. It seemed like this dresser was used for mostly makeup as that was just about all the drawers contained. You pull on the panties you had been wearing earlier and a black silk nightgown. You then laid down in bed and fell asleep.</p>
