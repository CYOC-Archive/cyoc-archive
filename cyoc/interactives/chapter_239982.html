<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the remote activated Todd, Todd shivered as he felt a tingling run over his skin. Todd found the sensation hard to describe, but his skin felt, stretched taut somehow. He found his body felt awkward to him, in a way it hadn&#39;t before, like it was... too big? Todd tensed as felt a shudder run thought his, body and felt the sensation ease a bit, but he couldn&#39;t tell why. The room around him seems a bit... bigger(?), yet surprisingly Todd found this new perspective somehow more comfortable. With a sigh, Todd relaxed, closing his eyes and taking deep breaths, focusing on enjoying the feeling of Karen taking him from behind with her cock. Todd almost thought that it felt bigger, but he must be imagining things.<br />
<br />
Across the room, Nancy watched puzzled as Todd and Karen continued to fuck. Nancy had sworn that Todd had just shrunken a bit, but on taking a second look he didn&#39;t look any smaller. As she continued to watch though, a sigh ran through Todd, and he began visibly shrinking. Before long Nancy guess Todd was shorter than her, and his shrinking showed no sign of slowing. Nancy was so distracted by this, that she missed the other changes at first. Todd&#39;s face had changed, his lips softer and plumper, the cheeks more angular. His hair was growing longer, and lightening from brown to a fiery red. Nancy looked, and saw signs of Todd&#39;s body feminizing all over. He was starting to look less like a boy, and more like a slightly androgynous girl.<br />
<br />
Todd felt his hair tickling his ears, and opened his eyes with a start. Todd looked around. Everything definitely looked bigger, and even as he watched his perspective dropped lower. Todd realized he was shrinking, and wondered how much height he&#39;d lost already. He raised one hand up to snag a lock of hair. It was too long and the wrong color, and growing longer and redder by the second. Todd noticed his hand seemed wrong and looked closer. His hand was too small, too delicate. Even as he watched it, the palm shrank and his fingers shortened, while the nails lengthened into a perfect feminine manicure. Todd rebelled against his changing body. &quot;I&#39;m not a woman!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Not yet, but you&#39;re getting closer.&quot; he heard Karen grunt from behind, continuing to thrust inside him. Todd looked down and saw she was right. His skin was softer and paler. His arms were thinner, his ass slightly bigger. His nipples were larger, and two small cone spoked out behind them, waiting to blossom into breasts. Even his voice sounded girly, soft and high.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s masculine pride warred with the feelings of pleasure Karen was causing in his ass, and the feeling of rightness his changes triggered. His transformation seemed to pause, caught between his conflicting sides. He was supposed to be a man, he was supposed to be tall, he was supposed to be hard and strong, and he definitely was not supposed to enjoy having a cock up his ass. But... he loved being small, and wanted to be smaller. He loved being soft, and wanted to be softer, curvier. He wanted this, wanted to be a woman, and SHE loved having a cock inside her!<br />
<br />
As Todd&#39;s resistance broke, his changes resumed. With a sigh, Todd&#39;s body shuddered, and he shrank down, not stopping until his height had dwindled to 5&#39; even. As he did, Todd felt his arms slim down and his shoulders narrow. Karen was treated the the sight of Todd&#39;s ass inflating as she thrust into it, Todd&#39;s hips spreading wide. &quot;Damn, girl, you got a nice ass.&quot; Karen said, giving it a smack that sent it jiggling. Todd giggled, blushing, but his ass swelled even larger in response. His feet shrank and became dainty, as his calves slimmed and his thighs softened. Todd felt his waist tighten and narrow, deepening his curves. Todd reached up with one hand to touch his chest as his nipples began to tingle. Todd felt the flesh for his chest inflate to meet is hand. Gripping one growing orb, Todd felt his breast grow fuller and heavier, until they were too large for him to get his small hand around. &quot;I&#39;m a sexy, curvy girl&quot; Todd thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s cock stirred at the thought. Todd reached one dainty hand down, and found his cock rock hard. Todd wrapped his hand around his shaft. It had never felt so large to him, and Todd wondered if it was just his smaller hand, or if his cock was actually bigger. Todd began stroking his hand up and down. He wondered if his cock would disappear, but on reflection, Todd felt... complete. This was who he wanted to be. Who she wanted to be. Todd continued stroking her cock, even as she bucked her hips to drive Karen&#39;s cock deeper. Karen was close, Todd could tell. Before long, Karen came with a shout, dumping her hot, sticky load deep in Todd&#39;s ass. Todd&#39;s own cock erupted a second later, splattering his flat stomach and the undersides of his breasts with cum.<br />
<br />
Todd pulled himself off Karen&#39;s cock and stood up. Nancy stared down at the short and curvy shemale Todd had become. Nancy towered over him, his head barely reaching her her breasts. Todd rather enjoyed the feeling of Nancy looming over her. Even Karen had a full head on her. Todd may be short, but she was stacked. Her full breasts were as big if not bigger then Nancy&#39;s. On her smaller frame they looked ginormous. Her hips and ass were curvy and plush. Her face was cute, with a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and fiery red hair framing bright green eyes like emeralds. Nancy noticed one blemish on Todd&#39;s otherwise gloriously female body, her cock, which looked huge on such a small girl, but somehow delicate: smoother and more feminine(?) if that was even possible.<br />
<br />
Todd seemed pleased with the changes, running his? her? hands up and down to explore her body. Nancy wondered what other kinks Todd&#39;s brain was hiding.</p>
