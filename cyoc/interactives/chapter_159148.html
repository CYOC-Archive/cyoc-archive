<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a knock on the door right in time. Jennifer tugged it open to be greeted by the clean-cut smiling face of her boyfriend. Kyle said she had no love in her life but here he was. It had taken Jen the better part of Junior year to land Nate, he always seemed a little reluctant, but as head cheerleader she had to have the captain of the football team. It was only natural. She chalked  his reluctance up to the fact he came from a very conservative, religious family. She still hadn&#39;t talked him into sex beyond a little oral, but he loved her she could tell.<br />
<br />
As always his blond hair was perfectly combed, his face clean and smooth, dimples in his cheeks from his smile. Normally he&#39;d be wearing a polo, but since there was a game today he had on his jersey, though paired with a pair of chinos. He always dressed impeccably. He looked good, he was popular, and he didn&#39;t argue with what she wanted. So.. perfect. Sometimes she wished he&#39;d unlace a little and...<br />
<br />
The whole world seemed to give a lurch. Clothes melted away off of both Nate and herself, though Nate stood there seemingly unaware of the alteration. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Jen opened her mouth to answer but couldn&#39;t seem to find her voice. Nate was changing right in front of her. It wasn&#39;t noticeable at first, his well coiffed hair got a little loose and shaggy. It still looked good on him, it just ruined his clean cut air, and he seemed to actually grow an inch or two as his face lost some of it&#39;s softness. He still had those boyish dimples but his jaw and cheek bones were more prominent. He looked less like a teenager, more like a man pushing into his early twenties. His jaw grew stubble, then into a full blond beard a little on the scruffy side.<br />
<br />
When they first started fooling around, Jen convinced him to start shaving his body hair, but that was growing back in, too. Curly dark blond pubes around his 6&quot; flaccid cock, and the strip up his stomach and little bit in the center of his chest that had been stubble moments ago was now growing out, and not just getting longer. It was covering more of his chest and stomach. Covering his pectorals, which also seemed, well, bigger.<br />
<br />
He actually seemed to be growing bigger all over, from the still lean musculature of a high school football player to the more impressive bulk of a college athlete. His arms with thickening with muscle, veins moving to the surface as his chest popped out, and his abs carved into a nice six pack. Other than the hair, Jen would have been quite pleased with these changes. Though he seemed to keep going.<br />
<br />
Jen couldn&#39;t put her finger on it, but he was getting older, going from his early twenties to his mid twenties. He softened a little. He didn&#39;t lose any of his bulk, in fact, he seemed to get even larger. He looked like a weightlifter, though he started losing some of his definition, such as his stomach smoothing out. He wasn&#39;t fat, he just wasn&#39;t concerned with being ripped, or so it seemed. &quot;Jen?&quot; His voice was even a bit deeper. It was still Nate, but a possible future Nate, probably around 26 or 27,<br />
<br />
Why had he changed? The curse was to transform her.. and her world? Was there something.. He was beautiful. He was the perfect man for her.<br />
<br />
Jen felt that thought like a kick to the head. &quot;Yeah, sorry, forgot something upstairs..&quot; She suddenly felt uncomfortable, like her body didn&#39;t fit quite right. He went through his change unknowingly, but it seemed her being aware was going to bring differences. She headed up the stairs in a bit of a panic. Her legs didn&#39;t seem to be working right, like they were too long. She ran into her bedroom and shut the door.<br />
<br />
She needed to think. She caught sight of herself in the mirror and her eyes went wide. She must have been changing while Nate was as she didn&#39;t quite recognize the person in the mirror. Her hair was short and auburn, just that little hint of red in it, cut in a undercut style some of the jocks at school favored. Her face was.. well she hated to say it but she looked like her brother. The feminine softness had left, leaving his face a bit heavier, with thicker jaw and brows and a more prominent nose.<br />
<br />
Her body was taller, and getting taller as she stared. No wonder her legs felt off. Her hands a feet were getting bigger, too. She had enough boyfriends to know she was probably sporting size 12 feet. Her hips were off as well, less curvy, and more narrow than her shoulders which looked particularly broad. She was... no...<br />
<br />
Reaching between her legs, she was greeted by unbroken skin where her vagina should have been, and a nub of growth right at the front of her crotch above a wrinkly bit of extra skin. Though it was growing fast, growing even as her breasts were shrinking away. The nub pushed out, growing longer and thicker by the second, it had a weird look to Jen though, and as she gave it a little tug she realized it had a foreskin. She had never been with an uncut guy before, but she knew what it was when she saw it. Her breasts seemed to stop shrinking at one point and instead flattened out into a pair of pectorals. Her nipples were still a little on the large side, but nothing too out of the ordinary.. for a guy.<br />
<br />
She was becoming a guy. Her brain wanted to scream, but her body wouldn&#39;t follow suit. Something about this felt so right, so perfect. Auburn pubes sprouted out around her cock as it slowed it&#39;s growth at just over six inches flaccid. She felt an uncomfortable pressure for a moment in her crotch as both her balls dropped into the waiting scrotum, which felt amazing once done. Peach fuzz grew into dark hair on her arms and legs, quite a bit of it, too,and thick bushes formed in her armpits. Even her jaw was darkening with a bit of a shadow as her pubes started growing in a line up her stomach.<br />
<br />
Staring back at her from the mirror was a young man she wouldn&#39;t have recognized at all, but wouldn&#39;t have been out of place in the senior class. Leanly muscled with his red-tinted auburn hair. He was kind of on the cute side, looking like he might belong on the track team, or maybe the swim team if he shaved.<br />
<br />
The changes weren&#39;t done with him yet though, much as happened to Nate, he was starting to age. Lean muscles gained some bulk, but not to the same degree as Nate. John was always going to be on the lean side, and actually stood a little taller than Nate. He could put on muscle, but he was built for running and swimming, not lifting and tossing heavy weights like his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
His face lost more of it&#39;s youthfulness as he let his beard grow in. He kept it neatly trimmed, a little more careful in grooming for himself, even if he liked his shaggy muscle bear of a boyfriend&#39;s no-cares look. Hair grew out along his chest and stomach, trimmed a little on the shorter side so as not to hide the definition he worked on. Nate might be fine with a flat stomach, and John had to admit it was more comfortable for laying his head on, but he wanted that nice cut look. Nate loved his men hairy though, so John only trimmed, he&#39;d never dream of shaving it completely. He also loved the feeling of his boyfriend&#39;s hands running through it, or of two hairy chests rubbing together. His dick gave a little jump at the thought. Nate was also the hairier of the two, so why compete. His aging slowed and stopped, leaving him the same 27 years old as Nate.<br />
<br />
There was a thought drifting through John&#39;s mind now. He remembered being Jen, knew he was till Jen in a way. But John&#39;s mind and memories were growing stronger.<br />
<br />
Why had Nate changed though? The curse was... Kyle had said her world could change to, and Nate was certainly included in that. Nate and John had met when Nate and Jen did, at least in the way the memories were coming. But they kept their relationship a secret. All the way through college, too. Nate&#39;s family, ultra-conservative and religious would never have accepted him as gay, but he needed their help to get through school. So they kept it secret, pretended to just be best friends. So the best situation for their love to exist was for Nate to be independent and on his own from his family. It didn&#39;t really change Nate, just made him older in the way he would have been in this reality, it turned the years forward.<br />
<br />
He remembered Nate finally coming out to his family. Some of his extended family accepted him, younger cousins, one aunt and uncle, a sibling. The rest cut off contact. He knew that was going to happen, but he had to tell them. He had to to them because... a wedding band formed on John&#39;s left hand, a twin he knew to one Nate was wearing.<br />
<br />
Clothes reformed on John, a black tank and a pair of blue basketball shorts, black sneakers appearing on his feet with low cut athletic socks. The room had changed, too. It wasn&#39;t Jen&#39;s old bedroom, but a master bedroom with a king sized bed he shared with Nate. There were pictures of them on the wall, a few from their Honeymoon in Mexico. John felt a bit of a pang of worry as he left the room to head downstairs. The whole house was different, smaller than the one Jen grew up in, but this was their house.<br />
<br />
Nate stood by the front door, scruffy as ever, though in purple basketball shorts, and a white tank top with a neck low enough to show off the hairy cleavage between his pectorals. Nate loved showing off his chest. He held to protein shakes in his hands, holding one out to John as he reappeared. &quot;Ready to go? Got everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. Thanks, hun.&quot; John said as he took the offered drink, exchanging a quick kiss with his husband, and they both headed out the door and to Nate&#39;s jeep.</p>
