<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen’s mind was racing as fast as her heart as panic set in and she looked around desperately trying to work out what the hell was going on. Her feet, one in a sock and one bare, squelched through mud and wet grass as she rushed across the open field with no way to control her body. Her panties-less state was flashed and revealed with every bursting stride and her breasts jiggled in her bra but she could do nothing about it, her hands refused to obey her and just kept up her running motion, swinging purposefully forwards and back.<br />
<br />
Barely able to bring herself to scream Jen eventually did so in total panic, “Oh God, HELP ME! Someone… please… I don’t know what’s happening to me!” aware that she had no way to control her body as it ran on without her wanting to.<br />
<br />
“Oh god, oh no, someone, please help me… please…!” Jen wailed, having control over her head and mouth which she threw around desperately, straining her head backwards in an attempt to slow or control her body, even shutting her eyes not wanting to look as her body ploughed on regardless, it clearly didn’t need to see to know where it was going. Jen’s lungs burnt with the need for air and her legs hurt as she ran on, if she could she would stop but her body refused to listen and if anything, increased its sprint even faster making her wail out for help.<br />
<br />
Jen’s eyes desperately looked around for any sign of someone that could help her but it was too late, she was in the middle of the pasture now, the nearest building, the farmers house, was over the crest of a small hill and nearly half a mile away.<br />
<br />
“HEEELLLPPP!” Jen screamed breathlessly, unable to draw enough breath with her running to be able to yell properly and her eyes grew wide as she realised she was running straight towards a cow that was lazily chewing cud in the middle of the field.<br />
<br />
Jen closed her eyes, terrified, her body was going to run straight into the cow at full speed, she couldn’t control her hands to cushion the blow and she was terrified that sprinting into the side of a cow at full force would probably cause her a serious injury.<br />
<br />
She screamed and winced and then yelled a little in relief as her body suddenly stopped running, barely feet from the cow. “Oh…. Thank… God…” Jen panted, too relieved that the running had stopped to notice that she still didn’t have control of her body. “W-w-w-wait… what am I doing? Oh God… oh no… stop! Please… Please HELP ME!” Jen wailed as her body approached the cow and started stroking it, her screaming didn’t seem to alarm the creature at all and Jen felt a new wave of terror wash over her as she felt the rough hide of the animal.<br />
<br />
“p-please… what’s happening…” she sobbed back tears as she watched her fingers trail down the side of the cow and her body followed, walking around to the animal’s side before she reached underneath to its udder. “I… don’t… understand…” Jen whimpered and she could only watch in disbelief as her hands grabbed the teats on the cows udder and gave a sharp pull, the udder disconnecting from the cow and hitting the grass with a light plopping sounds, sloshing like a big bag of milk would.<br />
<br />
“oh my God!” Jen gasped, staring at her hands and then up at the cow and down to its disembodied udder in disbelief. “This can’t be happening… oh … im sorry… im sorry… I can’t control my body…” she pleaded uselessly with the cow, but the animal didn’t even seem to notice her as it stood peacefully and continued to eat the grass in front of it.<br />
<br />
The scared cheerleader watched on in fear as her body pulled the heavy udder out from under the cow and set it aside on the grass before moving around the animal and starting pull other parts of it off as though they were never supposed to be there in the first place. First her hands grasped the animals ears and with a light tug, they snapped off in her hands, joining the udder in the pile on the grass. Next she trotted around the animal, her body removing her one remaining sock in the process, to grab the cow’s tail. It wriggled in her hand like a leathering snake before she gave it a tug and it went limp, disconnecting from the cow and joining the ears and udder on the floor.<br />
<br />
What happened next caused Jen to start screaming hysterically again as her hands reached up to the cows flank and dug her fingers into its side like it was a beanbag. The skin distorted in a way Jen knew was impossible and she could only yell in panic as her hands tugged roughly, and like the trick where you pull a table cloth off in one clean swoop, Jen’s body did the same to the cows skin. It came off like a black and white blanket, unrolling easily that she could then lay aside with the other parts. She stared at the cow confused, expecting there to be blood, muscle beneath the skin, but instead she found the surface of the cow was a brilliant pure white, smooth, shiny and hairless like porcelain.<br />
<br />
“A—are you ok?” she asked the cow, admonishing herself for talking to it but in her panicked state she didn’t understand what her body was doing to this animal. To her this looked so cruel and yet the animal seemed completely unfazed by what was happening.<br />
<br />
She didn’t get time to appraise what the hell the cow was actually made of before her body carried her around to the back of the animal again and knelt down, her knees sinking into the wet grass. Jen’s hands reached out and lifted the cows feet in turn, pulling off the hooves to leave it standing on weird looking stumps on its back legs, smooth nubs the same texture as the rest of its ‘skin’. The hooves joined the pile and then Jen’s body stood up and reached underneath the cows legs.<br />
<br />
“oh god… oh no… ew… ew ew ew… please… Oh God, SOMEONE HELP ME!” Jen yelled as her hands reached out and grasped the lips of the cows enormous pussy, and pulled, tugging at it eagerly. The cow moo’d slightly and then, with a plop, its pussy came free. Like a hole in a cartoon it came off in a flat fleshy leaf shape but Jen could still look within it at all the folds that gave it impossible depth.<br />
<br />
She was genuinely terrified of what she was going to do to the cow next, scared she might find her body taking its head off or its legs, splitting it up until it was nothing but parts, she sobbed quietly and closed her eyes, not wanting to watch.<br />
<br />
Of course, Jen couldn’t even begin to imagine the reality of what was about to happen next…</p>
