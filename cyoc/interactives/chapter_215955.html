<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;OH ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP!&quot;<br />
<br />
All eyes now focused on Lynne, the ghosts exclamation catching everyone off guard. Kari now watched as the ethereal figure began to dissipate, becoming a thick mist that now hung before Abolith and Morgan. The mist now seemed to rocket forward at supernatural speed as it approached the elf assassin.<br />
<br />
Kari watched in stunned silence as the mist now began to force its way inside Abolith. For the kitsune it almost looked as if Abolith was inhaling the mist as it forced its way down her nose and throat.  Aboliths eyes now went wide, the elfs body convulsing as her face contorted. Kari and Tricia now watched the elf twitch as she lowered her blade and took two steps backwards. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get Morgan out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari and Tricia were confused as they gazed at Abolith. They had watched the assassin speak but the voice wasn&#39;t Aboliths, it was Lynne&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it&#39;s me,&quot; Lynne exclaimed. &quot;Now get Morgan out of here! I can only control this woman for so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari and Tricia nodded, rushing to Morgan&#39;s side as they tried to escort their old friend out of harms way. &quot;Cmon Morgan we need to go,&quot; Kari exclaimed. Morgan though now found herself glaring at Abolith, a sinister smile on her face as she gazed at an enemy that had haunted her throughout her life. A low growl now sprang from the lycan sorceress&#39;s lips as she began to transform.<br />
<br />
Lynne, Kari, and Tricias eyes went wide as Morgan began to assume werewolf form. The womans body growing in size, white fur streaked with black overtaking her body as her mouth stretched into a fearsome maw, lined with razor sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan what the hell are you doing,&quot; Lynne exclaimed.<br />
<br />
With a snarl, Morgan now lunged at Abolith, sinking her teeth into the assassins shoulder. Lifting the elf off the ground, she now shook her like a ragdoll, her friends pleading with her stop. Morgan wouldn&#39;t listen, the werewolves ferocity on full display as she launched the elf through a wall. Abolith now collapsed in a heap coughing up a thick vapor that slowly began to take shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;The FUCK Morgan,&quot; Lynne exclaimed, the ghost slowly taking on a corporeal form. &quot;I maybe dead but I can feel pain when I&#39;m possessing someone and THAT HURT!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lynne and the others now argued, Abolith groaned. Lynne had taken her by surprise, the ghost possessing her body and keeping her from acting. Now free once more, she took stock of her injuries. Morgan had done significant damage, the elf noting the ragged tears in her shoulder and chest. The elf coughing as the shattered bones pierced her lung. In time the damage would heal, however, that was not what concerned the elf.<br />
<br />
The curse of the lycan was working its way through Aboliths body. The assassin  outing the dark veins slowly spreading out from the bite wounds. If Abolith didn&#39;t act quickly, she would find herself infected with lycanthropy. Fortunately she had prepared for this possibility.<br />
<br />
Grunting in pain Abolith now reached for a syringe. The serum within would cure lycanthropy, being a mixture if wolfsbane and silver nitrate, if administered with 30 minutes of infection. The only downside of the cure being that  it would place the elf in metabolic stasis. Abolith though was running out of options. Hoping that her longtime foes would be too preoccupied with Morgan to attack, Abolith now delivered the cure, grimacing in pain as the serum surged through her body. As the elfs eyes began to close, she could see a lone figure now approach in concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tricia how&#39;s Abolith,&quot; Kari called, the kitsune still attempting to restrain the enraged werewolf sorceress. Tricia bent down, her eyes going wide in terror as she studied the mangled elf. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she whispered as she felt for a pulse.<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Lynne called as she gazed at the dragoness. &quot;What is it?&quot; Tricia now glanced at the ghost and kitsune, shaking her head. From what she could tell, Abolith was dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia, Kari, and Lynne now spun, their eyes growing wide in horror as they stared at the black and red kit that now stood in Morgan&#39;s sanctum. Somehow Raiden had found a way to enter, the kit now sprinting to his mother&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
The kit hadn&#39;t said anything to anyone but, after Akira was attacked he had grown fearful of his own parents safety. Asking Sachiko for help, the celestial kits had come up with an ingenious spell. The spell itself was s elegant in its simplicity. If Raiden was ever curious about thw location of his parents, he simply needed to press firmly on a coin the pair had enchanted. This coin, (very much like the coin Yuriko had used in her youth to summon her godparents), would allow the kit to find his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Raiden whimpered as he fearfully gazed at his mother. &quot;Mom it&#39;s me! Mom wake up. Mom? Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari and the others said nothing, too stunned to move as they watched the heartbreaking scene. The kit was near panic, trying to wake his mother. Kari watched amhis eyes fill with tears as he now pushed his face against his mother&#39;s broken body, tears streaming down his furry face as he began to cry.  &quot;Raiden,&quot; Kari whispered. &quot;Raiden...I&#39;m, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden sniffed, a low moan escaping his lips as he squeezed his mother&#39;s body. When he had appeared he had noticed his Aunt Kari as well as the the Dragon Queen Tricia. At first confused as to what they were doing with his mom, he had gasped in fright when he noticed Morgan. He didn&#39;t know the sorceress well but understood she was the one who had hurt Sachikos dad. That was when he noticed who Tricia was standing over, his mother.<br />
<br />
Now it appeared that Morgan and perhaps Tricia had killed his mother, his Aunt Kari trying to hold Morgan back. A rage now began to build inside the young kit, slowly overwhelming his grief as he glared at those he held responsible for his mother&#39;s demise.<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Yuriko are you home,&quot; Darren called. After everything that had happened recently, lessons with Yuriko were becoming a priority. Teacher and student realized that precautions would need to be taken to deal with the powerful sorceress. Yuriko now answered the front door, a serene smile on her face as she gazed at her student.<br />
<br />
The serene atmosphere was now broken as a portal seemed to tear in the very fabric of reality. Knocked to the ground, Yuriko and Darren watched as several figures now exited the portal violently crashing to the ground. <br />
<br />
Yuriko and Darren were confused, noting Kari and Tricia now sprawled across the yard. Before they could even ask why, they noticed a large werewolf sail out of the portal, skidding to stop as she assumed a defensive position. Both wizards now realized the trio had been attacked, but by who?<br />
<br />
The answer to that question came quickly, Darren and Yuriko gasping in shock as Raiden emerged carrying the body of his mother. Yuriko and Darren couldn&#39;t be sure but the elf looked dead.<br />
<br />
The look on the young kits face made the pair fear the worse. Raidens face was a mixture of anguish and rage, his eyes glowing a sickly red as he now screamed. The other worldly sound causing Yuriko and Darren to cover their ears. <br />
<br />
What was even more unsettling was the power they could sense from Raiden. The young celestial had tapped into the power with in him. Darren gulping as he gazed at the angry young God. The celestial kits rage now looked to be unleashed upon Morgan and the others. Darren realizing he would need to calm the kit and stop Morgan before they destroyed the town.</p>
