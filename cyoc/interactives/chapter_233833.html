<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Norman made a short stop in the bathroom, quickly stripping naked, throwing his clothes in the laundry basket. “If everything works as intended, I won´t need them anymore, for more than one reason.” He thought to himself grinning. With that, he left for his older brother´s room first.<br />
Adrian was doing some homework assignment when he heard his door, which was open most of the time while he was home, being closed and locked. Confused, he turned around, only for his mouth to drop open in disbelieve. There stood his little brother Norman, but naked. He only carried around a plush toy, a small raptor that had been a present from him. But beside being naked, what was creeping him out the most was Norman´s face. A mad grin and somehow brightly white slowing eyes. But said eyes held something ... mesmeriz-ing, capturing in them. “Norman, what …?”<br />
“Sssh, be quiet Adrian. No need to talk, just be calm and look into my eyes.” Norman stopped his brother, slowly coming closer. Adrian felt himself comply, sinking deeper into these calming eyes. Whatever protest was there before was pushed back into nothing. His body also relaxed, letting him slip down on his chair. If he had been standing, he would have crumbled into a heap.<br />
Norman´s grin widened, as Adrian had fallen faster than Brian had. But he wanted to hear his brother break as he was changed, so he would only give him a few commands to follow. “Adrian, when I wake you again, you will be calm and not worry about me being naked. You won´t be any louder than in a normal conversation, whatever happens. And finally, you will follow any command I give you, as you can´t fight against my control. Soon, you will be fully mine to move around as I please.”<br />
When Norman was sure Adrian had absorbed his commands, he lifted the hypnosis he had put him under. <br />
Adrian woke up with a jump of his chair, blinking rapidly at Norman. He wasn´t sure, but something had startled him. No longer confused by Norman´s nakedness because it was nothing of concern for him, Adrian asked: “Do you need something from me, little brother?”<br />
Norman himself grinned, seeing Adrian ignore him being naked, and beside the jerk-jump when he woke up being calm. “Let´s see how you react to my commands as I change you” he thought. “Hehe, soon, I won´t be the “little” brother anymore. Not that I will be a “broth-er” anymore, either.”<br />
Aloud he said: “Oh, I need you do a couple of things, Adrian. But first, strip naked for me to see what we have.”<br />
Adrian was surprised by Norman´s order, as he knew Adrian hated being naked. “No way Norman. You know I hate being naked when alone, let alone if anyone is there to see me.” But while he said that, his hands moved on their own, quickly opening his belt, and then strip down his jeans and underwear in one motion without hesitation. As he stepped for-ward one step to leave the two behind, he also stripped off his socks, letting them drop on the pile as he went. Ho only noticed his bodies doing once he lifted his shirt, blinding him shortly before it too dropped onto the pile behind him. “What? Why have I stripped? Why did I do as you said?” he asked confused, blushing bright red in embarrassment, quickly hiding his genitals behind his hands.<br />
Norman laughed as he mustered his brother, but not explaining anything. “Oh, quit hiding yourself. There is nothing you need to hide, there is nothing down there to hide. Now, I don´t like being the “little” brother anymore, so let´s fix that. You will shrink smaller and grow younger, while I gain your loses in everything until I say stop. And stay where you are.”<br />
Adrian looked at his brother as if he was crazy. No one could just grow younger or age up that fast as Norman told him. But his look of confusion turned to shocked horror as he “felt” his cock shrink away into nothing. Had his hands lightly touched his tip before, they had lost that contact, and dropped to his sides. A look down showed him the last second of his once proud cock and balls as they vanished, leaving him smooth in the groin. A moan from Norman let him look back to his brother, already a head bigger and more mature look-ing, and his eyes nearly popped out seeing his big cock. It had also gained Adrian´s loss it seemed. “What the FUCK?” he asked loudly, noticing his higher, more squeaky voice in even more shock.<br />
Norman was moaning in pleasure. It was a feeling unfamiliar to him, but if felt as good as having his new powers, being able to control and transform others. He hadn´t thought about gaining his brother´s cock and balls as well, but with the experience how it felt, he wouldn´t want it any other way.<br />
He watched the room, and more important, his once older brother shrink as he himself grew bigger and older looking. His brother wasn´t in any way athletic, so he didn´t gain much muscles from him. Maybe something to think about later. Luckily, he also didn´t gain his brother´s weight, it seemed to be melting away some, but other it filled out Adrian´s now little body more. “Stop” he moaned in a deeper voice, stopping the process instantly. A sec-ond later, with a loud scream of pleasure, Norman cummed for the first time in his life, and showered his now little brother in it wholly.<br />
The amount of cum that escaped Norman´s cock was enormous, at least to the now small Adrian. He was only a bit above Norman´s cock with his eyes, the top of his head around the height of his brother´s navel. He had been a small child, only growing much after turn-ing eleven. So, as he had become younger and smaller at the same time, he was now a good bit smaller than he had been around this age before, not that he knew his age right now.<br />
The first blast of cum had hit him on his chest, and a second, stronger shot hit him on the nose. Luckily, he had closed his eyes just that second out of reflex, but now they were near-ly glued shut from the cum on his face. Further shots wanned in strength, so they hit deeper on his body, leaving a sticky and wet trail down his front to his toes and the floor between the brothers.<br />
While Adrian stood like a cum-covered statue, face a mix of disgust, horror and disbelieve, Norman still moaned in his afterglow. Theis had felt so good. Ever so slowly, he returned to more awareness, and started laughing at his brothers diminished size and the cum cover he got. When that ebbed away, he had one question he wanted answered, and even if his brother didn´t know, he would get it somehow through his powers. “Tell me, Adrian, what age are the two of us now, and how does it feel to be the little brother for a change?”<br />
Adrian didn´t know, he hadn´t even realized the question. But, like Norman thought it would, his body seemed to know, and answered almost mechanical sounding: “I´m about eight years old now, while you are sixteen, brother.” Then, a jolt went through Adrian´s body, re-turning his awareness to a more normal level. That enabled him to answer the second ques-tion honestly: “This feels so wrong, Norman. How is this possible? Please, change us back, I hate being small and I feel so helpless like this.” There was a hint of fear in his voice.</p>
