<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allen, Kent, Peter and Ty strolled into the skating rink shortly after the large facility had opened its doors for business. There were already a dozen people standing in line to buy tickets, but the line moved quickly enough for the boys.<br />
<br />
Once they arrived at the large indoor rink, they took their seats at the wooden chairs, where they laced up their skates.<br />
<br />
Only Ty and Allen laced up their skates, Peter and Kent decided to go play video games instead, since neither of them had their own pairs of skates with them.<br />
<br />
Ty and Allen skated around, until the DJ began to ask the skaters to leave the floor so that they could hold several skate races. The races were organized by age groups, and the little kids went first.<br />
<br />
Allen looked on and recognized some of the other skaters. Then he turned to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Dude… I can skate in the race, but it’s gonna be close…” Allen whispered in Ty’s ear.<br />
<br />
“Well, just do your best! We’ll see how it goes” Ty responded, hoping to reassure Allen that it was no big deal.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but the grand prize is a 100 Dollar gift certificate!” Allen pointed out to Ty, when he showed him the poster, which was hanging on the wall.<br />
<br />
“Wow! One-hundred Dollars!” Ty exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Look, there are the other skaters…” Allen observed, as a few other skaters lined up on the floor. Allen recognized one of them.<br />
<br />
“I know the kid wearing the speed skates! He’s really fast!” Allen said to Ty. “And I don’t have racing skates like he does!”<br />
<br />
“Oh? Can you beat him if you were to have a pair of skates like his?” Ty wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! But, where am I going to get a pair of skates like that? Those are very expensive! Look, they have five wheels on each blade, you see?”<br />
<br />
Ty folded his arms and pondered it for a moment. When he saw Kent and Peter walking towards the table where they were sitting, he suddenly got an idea.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter! Kent! Over here!” Ty shouted, waving his arms above his head. Kent spotted him first, and the geeky kid grabbed Peter by his shirt and signaled him to follow him back to where Ty was waiting for them.<br />
<br />
“Ty! Do something! The race is going to start in five minutes!” Allen said to Ty, looking a bit more concerned.<br />
<br />
“Relax, dude!” Ty chuckled. “I’ll make you a pair of brand new speed skates!”<br />
<br />
“Guys, Allen is about to participate in a race, but he needs a pair of speed skates. If he wins, he’ll get one hundred Dollars. I need your help. Are you guys with me, or not?” Ty asked Peter and Kent.<br />
<br />
“Sure, we’ll help!” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… We are?” Kent wondered, since he hesitated a little.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, little bro. I’m gonna transform you guys into the best pair of speed skates on earth!” Ty said with a wide grin.<br />
<br />
Immediately, both Kent and Peter were overcome with a tingling sensation throughout their bodies, as they both began to shrink rapidly. They quickly became too small for their clothes, and Ty patiently looked on as the pair dwindled down in size.<br />
<br />
When the two boys were about 8 inches tall, their bodies turned into layers of leather and plastic. They formed the soles of the boots, while Allen and Ty looked on with great delight. <br />
<br />
The plastic blades formed at the bottom of the soles, and five large wheels quickly materialized and were attached to the two outer blades, where they were fastened into place with nuts and screws.<br />
<br />
The top of the soles now grew a layer of leather and fiberglass, which formed the actual boot, which would hold on tightly to the foot of the skater. Laces formed on top, looping through several holes which appeared in the liner, which was inside of the boot.<br />
<br />
“Sit down on the chair, Allen” Ty instructed his buddy. “And keep your feet off the floor.”<br />
<br />
The two speed skates magically slipped onto his feet, and the laces were suddenly tied in knots. The liner of the skates fit so well around Allen’s feet, that they felt like they had become part of his body.<br />
<br />
“Wow! These skates are great!!” Allen cheered, as he looked on at the slick speed skates.<br />
<br />
“Alright, now get on the floor! Hurry! They’re about to start!” Ty shouted at him. <br />
<br />
Allen immediately stood up and skated over to the announcer, who was getting the names of the other three racers.<br />
<br />
While Allen was waiting for the whistle to blow, he heard two faint voices coming from his awesome skates.<br />
<br />
“We’ll make our wheels spin at top speed!” Peter shouted at Allen.<br />
<br />
“There’s no way you can lose, Allen!” Kent added on.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, guys… You guys are the coolest speed skates I have ever worn… Thanks!” Allen chuckled, while looking down at his talking skates.<br />
<br />
“Alright, skaters! Are you ready?” the announcer asked, as he placed the whistle in his mouth. As soon as he blew it, Allen and the others took off skating their fastest as they glided around the parameter of the rink. <br />
<br />
After they racers had completed three laps, the announcer then stood at the finish line, waving the black and white checkered flag. Allen was in second place the whole time, skating right behind the other kid with the speed skates.<br />
<br />
As soon as Allen entered his final lap, he gave it his all, and he slowly caught up to the other kid. Within seconds, Allen was ahead by just a few feet, when he crossed the finish line in triumph!<br />
<br />
“Yayy!! You did it!! You won!!” Ty cheered, as Allen skated right at him. Allen was panting, as he gasped for breath. His face was red and his forehead was completely covered with sweat. “One hundred Dollars, dude! You did it!”<br />
<br />
When Allen sat down on the bench, he immediately took his skates off. As soon as he set them down, they began to transform. The liner and the blade disappeared right before the sole started to grow and change color. Within seconds, the black sole filled up and took on the form of a tiny human being. The human figures then began to grow rapidly, until Peter and Kent had grown back to their heights. <br />
<br />
Ty made sure that the growth went so quickly, that nobody noticed that the two boys were naked for just a split second. Ty immediately wished for them to be wearing their clothes again, and everything was back to normal!<br />
<br />
“Wow! What a rush that was!” Kent cheered, as he walked up to Ty and Allen.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad I was able to help you win the race, dude! I hope we were comfortable!” Peter laughed.<br />
<br />
“You bet!” Allen replied, just when the announcer walked up to him, and presented the racer with a white envelope containing a check for one-hundred Dollars.<br />
<br />
“I guess you’re buying dinner tonight, dude!” Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
The boys hung out at the skating rink a little while longer. Ty and Peter were looking around, wondering if there were any other people there for them to help using their powers.</p>
