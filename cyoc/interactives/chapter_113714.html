<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week before the Animalia Christmas Exposition began...<br />
<br />
The more time Clara spent with Richard, the more enamored she became with him. Beneath his weak flesh and battered bones was a soul that shone strongly. He had a strong sense of duty, which was why he became a soldier in the first place. His belief was that a solider was not someone who went and fought because his government ordered him to. He felt that a solider should be someone who fought because his country needed him. Clara admired his sense of protection as well as his strong devotion to family. Unlike some people who came to Animalia all by themselves and had nothing left behind, Richard was still in touch with his family. In fact, they had been very supportive of him through his long recovery and encouraged him to go to Project Phoenix so he could shake his addiction.<br />
<br />
Clara hoped this would mean that Richard had no objection with starting a family with her. She had never felt the heat of her fertility cycle as much as she did right now. Granted, all the other times were when she was a mundane mountain lion. But even for an Animalian, she felt the desire to procreate very strongly. She wanted to have a new litter of cubs, one that will grow up in an enlightened world and be more prosperous than the cubs she had before the virus was uplifted. And the more she learned about Richard, the more she desired him to be the father of her cubs.<br />
<br />
As soon as Clara had finished meeting the other volunteers, she led Richard into a private room. There were the typical furnishing of a doctor&#39;s office in there, though a bed replaced the bench meant for patients. Richard was shaking slightly, a sign that his last fix of opioids was starting to wear off. &quot;Well, whenever you&#39;re ready,&quot; said Richard as he rolled up the sleeve on one arm.<br />
<br />
Clara put a hand over his bared arm and said, &quot;No, Richard, no more needles. You&#39;ve been jabbed enough when your bones were healing and your skin had suffered enough when you had to feed your addiction. You won&#39;t have to abuse yourself any further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how are you planning on giving me my dose?&quot; asked Richard, trying to keep his shaking in check.<br />
<br />
Clara smiled as she started unbuttoning her shirt. &quot;The old-fashioned way of course,&quot; she purred before pulling her shirt open, revealing her large breasts restrained by her lacy black bra.<br />
<br />
Richard&#39;s eyes bugged out a bit as he looked at Clara&#39;s globes. &quot;You really know how to come on to a guy,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pumas have no need for foreplay,&quot; said Clara before walking to the counter and started setting up a camera on a tripod.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot; asked Richard.<br />
<br />
&quot;A PR thing,&quot; said Clara as she checked the angle on the camera, &quot;Mr. Qvite suggested it might show how good Project Phoenix is if they have a picture of Animalia&#39;s leader helping one of the volunteers personally. You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;ll help Animalia, I suppose I can&#39;t object,&quot; said Richard, &quot;Besides, it&#39;s kinda kinky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping you&#39;d feel that way,&quot; said Clara before walking back to him. She unfastened her bra, exposing her pink nipples. She glanced at the camera to see if the angle was right. While she might be practically topless now, Richard ought to block her chest from view as he nursed just enough so that people wouldn&#39;t object. &quot;Are you ready for a new life?&quot; she asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been ready for a long time,&quot; said Richard as he walked up to Clara. He leaned his head down before gently putting his lips over one of her nipples. His stimulation soon got Clara&#39;s milk flowing. Clara moaned softly as Richard nursed from her. By sheer coincidence, Richard had latched onto the same nipple that Robbie had first suckled from after he had drank from the infected river. Clara looked down in anticipation, waiting for the first changes to start.<br />
<br />
Clara didn&#39;t have to wait very long. The back of Richard&#39;s neck soon grew fuzzy as his new fur started growing. The hands holding onto her grew larger before they started to change shape. The palms and undersides of his fingers grew rougher as pads formed. Furry flesh covered up his fingernails which were being changed into claws that could pop out of the new slits in his fingertips. Fortunately, he had removed his socks and shoes earlier so his feet could grow without impediment. His ankles lifted higher as his whole foot reconfigured to stand on the balls of his feet which quickly gaining a resemblance to cougar paws. There was a lot of clicking coming from him as he changed, the sound of the old cracks in his bones being mended or new bones being formed as was the case in his tail. He was also growing buffer, regaining the muscles he had lost from his long recovery and painkiller addiction. His clothes started to grow tight on him, ripping at seams that strained against the increasing mass. Clara moaned louder as Richard&#39;s mouth pushed out into a muzzle, stimulating her breast even more.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Richard stood up and wiped his lips. Where once Clara had towered over him, he now towered over her. He was truly a mountain of a mountain lion, his rebuild muscles straining his clothes heavily. Clara felt her heart beat even faster as she looked at the transformed veteran. Richard looked from one paw hand to another before flexing his arm, ripping his sleeve even more. &quot;I feel fantastic,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look even better,&quot; purred Clara as she ran her hands over his chest, feeling the toned muscles of his pectorals and abdominals. She slightly extended her claws as she moved her hands, cutting furrows into his ill-fitting shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, easy there,&quot; said Richard, &quot;I haven&#39;t even had my second dose yet.&quot; His hand tweaked Clara&#39;s other breast at that.<br />
<br />
Clara moaned and said, &quot;And you&#39;re gonna get it. In the best way possible.&quot; She shrugged off her shirt and bra before she unzipped her skirt, her panties quickly falling to the ground. She presented herself before him, an amazonian puma in the prime of youth, her body a perfect sculpture of muscles and curves. She sauntered over to the bed before lying on top of it. &quot;Well, are you going to keep me waiting, Dick?&quot; she asked in a sultry tone.<br />
<br />
Richard felt his altered manhood stiffen at Clara&#39;s offering. His enhanced scent of smell soon picked up her scent, which smelled so deliciously tempting to Richard. He could also pick up the scent of a mountain lioness in heat, something his new instincts were responding strongly to. He started tearing off his ripped clothing before pausing and looking at the camera. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we turn it off?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you have a problem with it,&quot; said Clara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, I like to keep things kinky,&quot; said Richard. His new claws made short work of his human clothing. Soon, he was as naked as Clara. His &#39;little Richard&#39; was hardly little now. It was a very healthy 9 inches long, extending from a new sheath, and had tiny little nubs on them. He rubbed his dick, feeling its new texture. A normal cat&#39;s penis was spiky to stimulate a vagina more. Thankfully, an Animalian&#39;s dick only had nubs instead of spikes, which made things a lot less painful for non-feline women who were doing some non-breeding inter-species sex.<br />
<br />
Richard crawled onto the bed, on top of Clara. His hand guided his dick until it was pressing against Clara&#39;s pussy. Clara crooned a bit, waiting for more. Richard leaned down and kissed Clara on the lips. At the same time, his dick passed through her other lips. Clara&#39;s moan echoed in Richard&#39;s mouth as he pushed himself in. After a little bit of tongue-wrangling, Richard started thrusting. Clara gave small gasps and moans. The little nubs on Dick&#39;s dick tickled the walls of her vagina. And his extended length was felt through every inch. She mewed as she started to thrust back against him, wanting to feel the movement inside her even more.<br />
<br />
Richard started making little growls as he thrust harder. He could feel her excitement, taste her eagerness, smell her need. The mating instincts of the cougar were quickly taking hold. He felt the urge to breed, to pound into Clara until she was full of his cubs. Clara cries only aroused him even more, stoking the fire inside. &quot;Yes, Dick, please, yes...&quot; moaned Clara as she ground against him, her breasts bouncing with her exertion, &quot;Don&#39;t stop until I&#39;m full, don&#39;t stop until I cum...&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, my mate, soon,&quot; growled Richard as he thrust harder. He soon felt the pressure building up, getting to the point of eruption. &quot;Here it comes, here it comes...&quot; he snarled as he gave one last thrust. The two mountain lions let out a mighty roar as the floodgates opened. His dick blasted out hot seed that was being greedily sucked up by her warm womb. The two of them panted and tried to catch their breath. Clara looked up at her mate and tried to see if there was any difference. Perhaps his muscles were more defined, his face looking fresher and less lined by stress and fatigue.<br />
<br />
Richard looked himself over and said, &quot;Well, this definitely a good start.&quot;<br />
<br />
He started to pull out of Clara before she grasped his shoulder. &quot;No, Dick, please,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I need more from you. I need you to give me your cubs. I can&#39;t last through my heat cycle another day. Please make a mother out of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard leaned down and gently kissed her. &quot;Of course we&#39;ll have cubs. We&#39;re going to have a big family,&quot; he whispered, &quot;And if you rather start now instead of later, who am I to say no?&quot; With that, he started massaging her breasts, stimulating her into starting up the mating frenzy again. Clara moaned as Richard&#39;s hands masterfully turned her on. Richard felt his dick start to energize again. Their mating was far from over. It was only a question of when they would exhaust themselves.</p>
