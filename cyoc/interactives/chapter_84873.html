<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally, Jess, Janace, and Justin, haven&#39;t been together for years, now are as if they were family again. Only Justin and Janace weren&#39;t married any longer. &quot;You know, Jan, you could come see Paris, majority of the French population are now kats. As is the Egyptian, I suppose, but that isn&#39;t for us to discuss. Anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Justin, I&#39;m going to stay right in Janace. I want to be close to my grandchildren, and great grandchildren.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts. You are married anyway, it would be weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I&quot;m just inviting you. We are still friends, if anything else.&quot; Justin had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, Dad, will you two stop. We&#39;re not here to reminisce or anything like that. We have a job to do.&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
As they got off they were greeted by the Delaware National Guard. &quot;Miss Sally, Miss Jess, Miss Janace and King Justin. Welcome to Dover. I appoligize it couldn&#39;t have been at a better time. But now&#39;s not the time. We&#39;ve set up a head quarters right here in the Airport. Right this way. The Vice President is here over seeing the opperations.&quot; The soldier escorted them to the office.<br />
<br />
Justin smiled. &quot;Well I&#39;ll be a monkeykat&#39;s uncle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello little brother, or should I say, Sister.&quot; He walked up and hugged Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister, brother, sisther, which ever you feel cozy using. How are you, Jake? So, I see I&#39;m not the only one who took a leadership role in government.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m only the vp. Not the actually man. He&#39;s on his way to Janace. They are making it the temporary capital until ours is restored to civil levels. Have a seat. We&#39;ll have plenty of time for pleasantries once we get done here in Dover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked. &quot;We got plenty of Vaccines, Mr. Vice President.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, I may be vice president, but I&#39;m your uncle first.&quot; He looked at hir. &quot;Now to the business at hand. I&#39;ve got scientists on hand ready to help make those stronger. We&#39;ll need your help with that, Jess. But first your task is this, to vaccinate Dover.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four nodded. &quot;Uncle Jake, perhaps you should head to Janace too.&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my job is here.&quot; he replied. &quot;Besides, I&#39;m going out to help my family do what they need.&quot; He stood up and took one of the dart guns, loaded it with the Wise Vaccine.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you get... infected?&quot; Jess asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be fine. Besides, if I do, I join my family as Kats.&quot; He smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
The five sat out to do what they needed. All in five different directions. Sally was working hir area. Shi was saddened that shi didn&#39;t have hir mate with hir but shi had to do this to ensure hir new kittens had a safe place to live. Shi also set it as a mental mission if shi shall come across orphans, and even had it okayed by the US government to do so, take them home with hir to have set up for adoption. This was hir mission, but shi knew the primary objective was to vaccinate all of Dover. Shi looked around and started work. Shi was constantly thinking of hir mate, and hir daughters. This outbreak had interupted the greatest celebration in Midnight and Talia&#39;s lives. Yes they had their reception, but they hadn&#39;t had their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
Hir section went by quickly. The area was rather peaceful, just fucking here and there, but this seemed to have been the least populated area. Just then shi had walked to an alley, Someone speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah he got on the plane today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me. Did you mention someone got on a plane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it before or after the outbreak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After, from here. He was tired of getting raped, and left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For where?&quot; Shi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honolulu, why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Look, was it a kat that just changed due to the outbreak he was raped by?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... why?&quot; the kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Just great. The eastern seaboard outbreak just hit Hawaii.&quot; Shi ran and made a call. &quot;This is Sally Wise, is this the Sec Def.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, what is it, Sally?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to ground all air travel now. And investigate all flights from here to Honolulu.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll get the FAA to do so, and get right up on it...&quot; He grabbed another phone, keeping Sally on the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;FFA.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen this is a direct order from the Secretary of Defence, I need all flights globally grounded, until further notice. And I need a flight route from Dover to Honolulu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a direct flight yesterday, strait through, sir. And that&#39;s the only flight. No linked flights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; He said, and hang up. He then got back to Sally.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;There was only one flight out of Dover to Honolulu, and it was a direct flight. Why the concern?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, by the time we get done, all of Hawaii will be Kat central in the US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I&#39;ll seen word back to Janace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. Now I must rendezvous with the others.&quot; Sally hang up and started moving.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jess had similar luck, only no one left after being infected, it being the slums of the city. And mostly children had been infected here. So shi vaccinated them before it reached their parents, or anyone else. Shi hated it when one would run though, but shi caught him. Janace had just as much trouble, only there was a large number of adults. Shi had found the adults of the children of those Jess were vaccinating. It would seem the children in Jess&#39; section pushed all adults away and the adults made this their section. So they wound up meeting in the middle and decided to work together, mother and daughter.<br />
<br />
Justin and Jake, decided to work together too. They had made fast work of their section, however the two got separated, and due to the vice president ordering all secret service members to stay with the president, he had no protection. He walked right into a some Hyakats. He aimed and tried to fire, until he had realized he was out of ammo. The two walked up laughing. He backed right up into another, who had grabbed him. Shi was happy to see hir new fuck toy, and was waiting to add to hir fuck pack. Shi had the other two hold him down, stripping him naked, they then bound him to a pole and the leader rubbed hir pussy on his cock. The kat pushed back and let his cock penetrate. &quot;Hmmm....&quot; Shi moaned as shi ground hir cunt on his cock. However it wasn&#39;t until long that Justin found them, and darted all three, which they fell, not sure what had happened. However, the damage was done. Justin then grabbed Jake and held him to the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, look at me. Focus. I know you can resist the lust. You have the strand to. Though you may not have it to keep from changing, you can resist the lust.&quot; Shi held hir brother as he began to change. &quot;Shit. How do I explain this to Homeland Security.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake started changing as Justin held him down, knowing shi may not be able to hold hir himself. Just then, hir luck would change for the better as Sally would be walking by. &quot;Daddy? Wha....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No time, dear, I may need you to help me hold  him down.&quot; Shi stammered.<br />
<br />
Sally nodded as Jake progressed, Breasts would start to grow as his body would lengthen, his forelegs would grow in next, fur much like the hyena&#39;s started to grow on his body as a tail grew in next. Once on fours, Jake&#39;s face began to push out, and ears move up, Soon the change was near done as his balls became internal, a sheath would form and then the final change would be a pussy. Jake&#39;s cock was rock hard and he wanted to fuck. Justin took a needle and vaccinated hir sibling. &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Shi held hir close as shi nodded.<br />
<br />
As the Dover teams started wrapping up, including Justin explaining things to the President and his cabinet on what had happened to the VP, they had decided to do a full search of Dover just to be safe.</p>
