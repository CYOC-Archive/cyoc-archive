<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Melody's mother discussed the best way to get rid of the mirrors on the way back to the storage room. You settled on breaking the mirrors. This should prevent them from trapping anybody else. If you were lucky it would completely break the spell and return you to your own body while freeing Melody and Christine. You were worried about one of you becoming trapped in one of the mirrors but Melody's mother reasoned that if someone was going to take over their lives that they wouldn't risk it and would have made sure that wouldn't happen to them. Of course this would mean that you would be the one to break the mirrors.<br />
<br />
Melody's mother stayed outside of the storage room while you went in to break the mirror. You were wary of the mirror almost convinced that you would be floating in clouds. That didn't happen and you were able to break the mirror. All you had to do was hit it lightly and it shattered. It seems like they became brittle after they changed someone. At least this mirror wouldn't be used to trap or transform anyone again. Unfortunately you didn't transform back into yourself or Christine. You leave the storage room and head to the guest house.<br />
<br />
Once you enter the guest house you get a shock. Standing in front of the mirror was Christine wearing male clothes like you did when you were first transformed. The mirror was now empty and Melody's mother might become trapped in it. You quickly dashed to the mirror and broke it.<br />
<br />
You turned around just in time to see Christine's furious face and hear her yell &quot;YOU STUPID CHILD! NOW THERE'S NO WAY I'LL BE ABLE TO CHANGE BACK TO MYSELF!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to know how the mirror works&quot; Melody's mother said. &quot;Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MIRROR!&quot; Christine yelled. &quot;IT STOOD TO REASON THAT SINCE IT CHANGED ME IT COULD CHANGE ME BACK. NOW THAT CAN'T HAPPEN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately the mirror wouldn't have changed you back&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT!?!&quot; Christine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because two months ago I had come in here as a man and was transformed into the woman you are now&quot; you said. &quot;I've been in here plenty of times since and I never regained my true form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't?&quot; Christine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you said. &quot;I'm sorry to say that you would have been stuck as Christine even if the mirror remained intact. Then there's the danger that the mirror would trap someone else. We had to break it so that wouldn't happen. I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone becoming trapped in that mirror would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no&quot; Christine said. &quot;But what's this about people being trapped in the mirror?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently the mirrors were suppose to trap me and my daughter within them&quot; Melody's mother said. &quot;One did trap my daughter and this one trapped one of our maids named Christine. That's who you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I DON'T WANT TO BE A FUCKING MAID!&quot; Christine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that bad&quot; you said. &quot;The work is pretty easy and you're treated with respect. The other maids are very friendly as are the other servants. The only thing is that you sleep with the other maids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I can handle not having any privacy&quot; Christine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This mansion is very old&quot; Melody's mother said. &quot;The quarters the servants sleep in were once slave quarters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you put your servants there?&quot; Christine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mansion has been in my husband's family for generations&quot; Melody's mother said. &quot;It has been remodeled over the years but the servants that joined the mansion's staff of their own free will insisted that the servant's quarters remain largely untouched except for adding electricity. Of course we have had some that had wanted more privacy so we found other quarters for them. We could do the same for you. You don't even have to stay at the mansion if you don't want. It's whatever you want. We do pay our servants well so finding a nice place to live if you don't want to live here shouldn't be too hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do your servants get any days off?&quot; Christine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they do&quot; you said. &quot;You have every Friday and Saturday. Though I'm sure the master will change that if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melody you don't call your father the master&quot; Melody's mother said. &quot;I know you've gotten used to calling him that over these past two months when you were Christine. But you are Melody now and you will call your father Dad or Father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course mistress&quot; you said bowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same thing goes with me&quot; Melody's mother said. &quot;You will call me Mom or Mother. And don't bow to me or your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry&quot; you said blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it will be difficult for you&quot; Melody's mother said. Turning her head to Christine she added &quot;I know it will be difficult for you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don't have much of a choice do I&quot; Christine said. &quot;Well I can't wear my clothes now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get your uniform&quot; you said. &quot;Another one should have appeared.&quot; You open the dresser and pick out the maid uniform and underwear. You hand them to Christine and say &quot;You can change behind the privacy screen. If you need any help putting the bra on just call to one of us. I should warn you that once you put the uniform on Christine will try to take over. I think that you should at least let her take partial control. That way you won't be so out of place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I could do that&quot; Christine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your name before?&quot; Melody's mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it was Miki&quot; Christine said.<br />
<br />
Christine didn't go behind the privacy screen but changed right in front of you and Melody's mother. She was going to handle sleeping with the other servants. You decide that you should take your own advice and let Melody have some control over your body. After all, it wasn't her fault that this happened and she should have some say. Especially after being trapped in the mirror for seven years. You relax your will a bit and Melody comes forward fully though she didn't push you back. Instead you mixed together. Memories of Melodies life flooded into your memories.<br />
<br />
Your eyes had closed during this and you opened them now. You looked at your mother and said &quot;It's good to see you again Mommy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melody?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we blended together but remain separate&quot; you said. &quot;I remember calling you Mommy the last time I saw you so I slipped and called you that. I guess that I should get used to calling you Mom now that I'm thirteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Melody&quot; your mother said. &quot;I know this must be strange for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is&quot; you said. &quot;I have both personalities and memories now. There's no conflict between the two though. At least not right now. I'm sure there will be some when I grow older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's to be expected&quot; your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress, little mistress&quot; Christine said bowing. &quot;What should we do about the broken mirror?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll say that someone had evidently came in here last night and broke it&quot; your mother said. &quot;You had come out to clean the guest house and we came out to ask you if you would come with us to the water park on Saturday. We caught you just as you were turning around to come tell us that the mirror was broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my old clothes?&quot; Christine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's evident that whoever broke the mirror left them&quot; your mother said. &quot;Now you two stick to that story and we'll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the mirror in the storage room?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll say that I was in there for something and I accidentally broke it&quot; your mother said. &quot;Now we should go call the police and report that someone was in the guest house and broke the mirror.&quot;</p>
