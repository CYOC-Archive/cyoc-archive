<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather placed the Cat&#39;s Eye on to the chocker, nearly clicking its holder in place so that it was ready to be activated with a slight press. Looking up at Ophelia, who was once again was sitting on her lap ever since entering in the car, she handed it over to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, put this on, and once we get home, just click the gem holder into place&quot; instructed Heather.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the chocker, Ophelia skillfully slid it over her 2 pointy ears, over her face, until it rested properly on her neck. She then slid the rest of her hair out from underneath the band, all while being careful to not press the gem holder. Finally finished with putting it on, she looked down at Heather, only to lean into quick a kiss.<br />
<br />
Quite enjoying the kiss, but wanting to save it until they got home, Ophelia broke away. &quot;How do I look?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful as ever, but to me now, you are even more gorgeous. Also with a bit of kinky mixed in, thanks to your new collar, my pet&quot; asserted Heather, making sure to set of Ophelia&#39;s submissiveness early, so they can begin immediately when they finally arive home. <br />
<br />
Ophelia was already fairly wet with anticipation. But after being called Heather&#39;s pet, it sent her horniness into overdrive. The realization that she was expected to act like Heather&#39;s obedient pet tonight tipped her over the edge. She started panting, turning a bit red in her face. Her horniness would easily have allowed her to rip off Heather&#39;s clothes and fuck her brains out right then and there. However, she was to be an obedient pet. Her owner had not given her permission yet. All she could do was endure it the best she could until they got home.<br />
<br />
However, they were shocked when they actually reached their home. The place was entirely different from what they ledt it as. Now a sizable, walled in property with seemingly intense security measures and a big, solid metal gate with a scanner on it. Beldazarr then informed both of them with his thiught, of his changes he had made. <br />
<br />
Sighing with relief that everything was ok, Heather stepped out of the car. But, to her surprise, Ophelia didnt step out after her. Instead, she decided it was best if ahe crawled out on all fours, stopping next to Heather&#39;s leg, only to sit like a dog. All the while, her tongue was hung a few inches out of her mouth and she was panting heavily. <br />
<br />
After thanking the driver as they drove away, Heather opened the gate with the scanner. Once it fully opened, both began making their way to the door, now a notably longer path than the few steps it use to be. The entire way, Ophelia remained on her hands and feet. She had removed her heels while Heather was opening ths gate, and they now hung from her mouth. Her tail was raised up over her body, and was quickly wagging back and forth. And, all this time, she hadn&#39;t once stopped smiling. If anything, since getting home, her smile has only gotten brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy girl, we are almost there, but before we move further let me help you out of that dress first&quot; said a similarly horny Heather, having switched into full dom mode. &quot;Pets do not wear clothes in this house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once stripped entirely, save for her choker, Ophelia immediately was overcame with a feeling of relief. Apparently, while she was able to wear cloths, her body greatly prefered to be naked. Her pussy was dripping, leaving a trail behind them as they continued the short walk to the house. <br />
<br />
Heather was quietly impressed. Due to her body being adjusted, Ophelia was able to walk on her hand and feet, and it looked natural. Like it was her normal position, and she was quadropeddle by default. She obviously wasn&#39;t, but her skill at menovering her arms and legs in synch with each other was interesting to watch, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Heather reached down and began petting her pet, while a hand secretly clicked in the gem, activating the magic. With the gem in place, Ophelia began taking on the mannerism and mentality, that she was Heather&#39;s pet kitten. With that, she began purring while Heather continued scratching behind her long ears. She guessed that dragons must be able to purr, since this gemstone did not change the body in the slightest. Ophelia also began rubbing up against her leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Kitty, time for some fun&quot; said Heather, picking up Ophelia in her arms, draping her over her right shoulder. Ophelia being super light for her size only further promoted the image that she was a cat now. Her tail happily still pointing upwards, although no longer wagging nearly as much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meow&quot; cried Ophelia in aggreance. Jumping down from Heathers shoulder once they entered the house, Ophelia made her way over to her new nest. All while still naked on all fours. Heather quickly stripped herself and switched her pussy for her cock and balls. She too felt a similar sense of relief when returning her cock and balls, Ophelia&#39;s earlier wish still seemed to be fully in effect. She truly felt better without having her pussy, but instead a massive cock and huge, smooth balls which were big enough to make walking slightly more difficult. <br />
<br />
Hearing her owner making their way to the next, Ophelia turned around, facing away from the door. She laid down on her stomach, while pressing her ass as high as she physically could manage. Her tail still above her, but now curled forward slightly. Eagerly waiting, she looked over her shoulder for her owner.<br />
<br />
Entering the room only to see her girlfriend, ass up waiting to be fucked blanked out Heather&#39;s mind. All she could think of was fucking her girlfriend all night long, until they eventually fell asleep, knotted together. She only hoped she would wake up still balls deep in Ophelia, making sure her pussy and womb are always eager and able to take her cock at any time.</p>
