(AN: I feel like I've been going mental all week. ) <br />
<br />
Kaylee had actually the final part of the pack's creed from an anime involving a ray gun <br />
that turned innocent girls permanently into brainwashed cat girl maids, unlike in that story <br />
though, here it seemed as if that plot element would actually be resolved. <br />
<br />
In all this storming confusion, Chester the Chihuahua, Fran's faithful and simply pet, had <br />
been completely forgotten by all. The poor animal had no magical lineage, nor did he <br />
under any time come under the direct effects of any transformation or mind control by the <br />
game.  So unlike Judas Chester had concept of the changes to reality around him. He <br />
remembered and only remembered his owner Fran, her two sisters, their mate, and of <br />
course his owner's shared offsprings the glass pups who were the closest to him. And of <br />
course, being owned by the apparent chosen of Fenrir. He remembered and only <br />
remembered them being on good terms with the apparent chosen of Bast.  And like any <br />
dog, familiarity dissolved hostilities. <br />
<br />
He had no idea why so many of his owners pack mates were now hurt, he only hoped <br />
someone remembered to feed him, and that they'd all be alright. <br />
<br />
Judas and his brothers of course remembered everything, being direct descendants of the <br />
familiar of one of the three witches. The cats were completely divided about it. Some saw <br />
it as Bast handing out her blessing among humans, while others thought it was an <br />
abomination, a direct and personal affront to the felidae perfect. <br />
<br />
Judas and his brothers had felt it of course, the death-stroke at the curse's heart, leaving <br />
the curse hopelessly brain damaged. <br />
<br />
When Paul had returned to the church, the catholic black cat listened in on the discussion. <br />
<br />
Of course the wolves and the lions being able to understand their mundane cousins to <br />
varying degrees was purely a part of the magic that had birthed them: after all, -humans- <br />
didn't exactly speak ape after all. Otherwise Paul's condition wouldn't be half the problem <br />
it was. <br />
<br />
Hearing about Trevor's mutation into something that was like the girl Judas had found and <br />
led back to the church... Personally, Judas just hoped Trevor found what Trevor was <br />
looking for. Hearing the conclusion of the tale, Judas thought, 'All that needs to be done <br />
now is to spread the cure and bless the town, and the game can finally be laid to rest.'  <br />
Strangely Judas felt a sense of relief when Paul recounted how Trevor had broken the neck <br />
of the shadow of his ancestor, 'Maybe now she can reset in peace.' <br />
<br />
Of course Judas' elder and younger brother felt the same, it mattered little to them, the <br />
past was the past, let it stay in the past. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;It's happening AGAIN.&quot; Ami said with some despair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kurse.. Kurse KNEW she'd loose, she just wanted to make sure we'd never be able to enjoy <br />
our win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More elements being thrown into the stew pot when they should be thinning out now, it's <br />
insanity...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Which I think for Kurse is precisely the point....Can we still fix it Ami?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;'We' were supposed to be done now, but it seems that Kurse wanted to almost make sure <br />
we'd never rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We have to make sure the rope stops from splitting apart again, or what little drive to <br />
move foreword we have will be -dead-.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know... one truth I think I've begun to realize after dying though,&quot; Ami began, &quot;Is that <br />
there is no such thing as a perfect future.&quot; Ami kissed Amy on the forehead, &quot;We've had a <br />
long hard night and a long hard sleep, it's time to wake up for a bit.&quot; <br />
<br />

Kathy was surprised, but completely and utterly relieved when she had decided to play a <br />
game of 'pretend' using her little twin brothers as guinea pigs (she go to Confession on <br />
Saturday) of Transform and Dare and nothing had happened no matter how many times <br />
they had done it. It gave Kathy a rather large overwhelming sense of relief that she'd have <br />
no more to do with that awful game.  Even as she felt her memories of ever being human, <br />
and ever being partially human slowly dissolving, she calmly accepted her fate. Her family <br />
was still together, they still loved each other, and she still had her life to live, and nobody <br />
what so ever she spoke to treated her as a freak and apparently as soon as she graduation <br />
from Frostvile Highschool there were some body conditioner brands who were interested <br />
in her trying out to model for their products... of course there would be other lined up <br />
too. But Kathy felt the confidence she could manage it.  Now she just felt like actually <br />
THANKING that lion cub boy she had run into at the pet store... too bad she hadn't gotten <br />
his name... <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning/afternoon.  the first thing that had happened when Luna and Sunny had <br />
set foot into the Wolf Estate led by Abbey, was being greeted happy by the pair Terri and <br />
Sandi as if they had been part of the pack of years, then having medical supplies and what <br />
not shoved into their arms and shouted at by Fran to hurry and help with treating the <br />
damaged Yomato, Chiyoye (who had to lay on he back and have support for her much <br />
extra biologically impossible chest weight), Zack, June, Hope, Grace, Isebelle, Megan, <br />
Margot, Ashley. Alexandra was staying put since that was what Master Jensen wanted and <br />
that was all that mattered. Nicole, they had caught her twice getting up out of the make <br />
shift bed they had placed her on in the crowded medical wing, but now had resorted to <br />
guarding and binding her. The only teen wolf in the mix Millie sat bored reading comics.   <br />
And -that- wasn't counting the Pride. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any regrets?&quot; Luna asked calmly to Sunny, feeling the memories of the life she had, of the <br />
person she had been slowly being replaced as reality sought to completely remove any <br />
connection the Big Bad Wolf pack had with the game in any shape or form. <br />
<br />
Sunny groaned, sighed, then said, &quot;Yep. Too late now. And seriously? It ain't really all that <br />
bad when ya got over fifty pack-mates looking out for you thicker than blood.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Glade to know.&quot; Luna nodded as the sun and moon wolf were hurried along as Jasmine <br />
was busy keeping Pride mates comfortable as Fran worked tirelessly resetting bones <br />
changing bandages and draining fluids. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It was a day after Kurse died and Rick was standing at the railing of the yacht. Maylene <br />
and Dennis came to the railing too Maylene asking, &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what happened to us on the island,&quot; Rick said sighing. &quot;How I became a bear, you a <br />
pig, and Dennis a chimera. How we came so close to losing each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Maylene asked looking a little hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm saying that I wants to marry you,&quot; Rick said falling to one knee and putting Maylene's <br />
hand in his his. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I'll marry you,&quot; Maylene said throwing her arms around Rick and kissing him. Once <br />
she was done she asked, &quot;So when should we get married? I would like it to be as soon as <br />
we get back. Or I think the captain has the power to marry us. We could get married <br />
today.&quot; She declared obviously very excited.<br />
<br />
<br />
Marie looked at Rick, Maylene and Dennis with envy. Regardless of everything and <br />
anything, the at least would get to live a perfectly normal and happy life and Dennis would <br />
get a normal and alive childhood. <br />
<br />
Marie no longer had that option, when transformed into the replacement Glass, she had <br />
glimpsed into the eyes of truth, she couldn't go back to being the ignorant and blissfully <br />
little boy she had been. Yes, she envied Rick, Maylene, and Dannis very much. <br />
<br />
Much magic was a -natural- part of creation, it needed a filter and to be tempered the <br />
same as any natural force, and that duty had fall onto Marie's shoulders weather they liked <br />
it or not, she now knew much more than any child her age had a right to. She had slipped <br />
into the world of mirrors, her dress still black with red runes. She wept, she came out of <br />
the mirror an hour later glade the tears didn't translate to her glass form in the outside <br />
world outside of her universe in the mirrors.  <br />
<br />
She saw the passengers look at her, mostly as an oddity, some scared, some sympathetic, <br />
but diverse, as people will surprisingly always be. After all, they all now carried the scars <br />
from Kurse's last stand, hers were just easier to see. She was still indestructible however, <br />
and she still had an infinite number of turns at her command that didn't even need to obey <br />
the rules (that power had been lost to Samantha once freed and transferred to Marie when <br />
she had become Glass). She had nothing to fear from the passengers even if they tried to <br />
tied her to an anchor and throw her overboard.  <br />
<br />
However, it was now her responsibility to help them, just like it was Ami's to help the <br />
pack. Marie hoped her mental link to the infinite chaos closed off completely soon as soon <br />
as reality mended, this constant influx of knowledge she shouldn't know could drive her <br />
made causing the cycle to just repeat itself destroying the hard work and hard efforts of <br />
EVERYONE if she wasn't careful. <br />
<br />
Marie knew, even as she left this island with her mother, that this island would now and <br />
forever be a part of herself, for she was now a part of it. With Kurse gone forever, and the <br />
curse soon to die in Glendale, she would be the one whose reflection decided what <br />
direction the organized chaos now ingrained in Big Bad Island would go. <br />
<br />
If Eliza had looked, she'd have noticed the photo of her gone and forgotten husband's <br />
photo was now of a male wolf. How the two species' managed to have the same number of <br />
chromosomes was a miracle of nature.  And the baby pictures of Martin showed a baby girl <br />
wolf in diapers, though the most recent ones showed a naked glass she-wolf with a well <br />
hidden perchance for white magic. <br />
<br />
Once reality sealed, Marie would be looked at no more than any other child, being just one <br />
wolf among many. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity woke with a feeling of loss. As soon as they ended the turns she wouldn't <br />
have anything left to do. She had spent most of her life fighting the curse. Trevor's idea of <br />
it being used out of love instead of spite was a nice dream but she had seen too much of <br />
humanity to really think that would come true. No the only way to make sure that it wasn't <br />
used in spite again was to end it.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Serenity saw a naked little gray and black lion-boy, almost looking <br />
like a girl without his mane if you didn't look down below. <br />
<br />
Trevor asked, &quot;Madam Serenity are you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am Trevor,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;Do you need something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well breakfast is almost ready but I wanted to talk to you,&quot; Trevor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well come in and talk,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
Trevor came in and sat on the bed. After a moment he said, &quot;I've been thinking about the <br />
game since I got up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It needs to end Trevor,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;It's the only way to save people from the <br />
misery they could have because of a Transform or Dare. I know what you're going to say <br />
but think about this. The boy who transformed you did so to get your spot on the team. <br />
Now do you think he would have still done it if the witches weren't part of the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor had to think it over a bit and finally said with a sigh, &quot;He still would have <br />
transformed me. But maybe it wouldn't have been in a way that made me so miserable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps but he still would have done it out of spite,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;You'll always <br />
have those that will use the power they have to make others as miserable as possible. It's <br />
just their nature. Do you want to see more people be as miserable as you were?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Trevor had to answer truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then the game must end,&quot; Madam Serenity.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's something else,&quot; Trevor said. &quot;I don't think the game will ever end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the turns are eliminated from people the game will end,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about those outside of Glendale who may have a turn?&quot; Trevor asked. &quot;You said <br />
yourself that we can't track all of them down. What if one or more of them come back to <br />
Glendale and use their turn? Wouldn't the game then continue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't believe this, &quot; Serenity said, &quot;I actually had a dream last night talking to a white <br />
wolf girl with red markings like brush strokes. She said that since Kursed forced every <br />
person outside Glendale to use their turn, and many who didn't have turns to begin with, <br />
forcing them through with sheer force of will, they was only able to keep them going by <br />
giving them turns that no longer were bound to the game itself, thus the only turns left <br />
outside of Glendale were the ones Kurse was handing out like candy, and they died and <br />
vanished like the passenger victims I'm told reverted to being human again. It's time for <br />
the future to move foreword Trevor, the night is finally ending.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Trevor nodded kicking his feet. &quot;The witches are dead. There's no intelligence to the game <br />
anymore so it shouldn't be able to twist anyone's words until we can use the cure on <br />
Glendale itself. I've learned to make the most of life while I have it. I'm not going to make <br />
the same mistake with Mary as I did with Queen. You've gained skills that you can use <br />
even if a case has nothing to do with the game. The police have gained several lions who <br />
can smell things humans can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then a cub that seemed to be a bit older than Trevor was now and was colored like <br />
him came in and said in a clearly female voice, &quot;Breakfast is ready. Mom said to hurry up <br />
or you'll miss out.&quot; She left and Madam Serenity and Trevor followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was my little sister... now I guess my big sister, she ran up to me and hugged me and had <br />
finished transforming before I got a chance to get a word in edgewise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any regrets?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At this point, I've given up trying to figure out what makes reality really anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
'Indeed.' The pack didn't have last names from what Serenity had been told of the <br />
interrogation.  The pride did, but that was likely more due to Brian and Felicity not wanting <br />
them to lose their individuality (ironic given how similar the lionesses all were). <br />
<br />
So it was odd that Job and Marie, Trevor's parents, would call Kaylee and Jensen by what <br />
had been their last names in a timeline that no longer existed, then again, since reality <br />
was still in flux with the sheer changes from over a hundred people in less than a week <br />
being altered by the curse, it was no surprise that bugs would remain in the timeline for <br />
some while until existence had time to scab over and heal completely. <br />
<br />
It seem that though that all the lions within Glendale knew one another, then again, Trevor <br />
had already been technically part of the pride due to the 'love cascade' effect that the <br />
pride had save for Mary, Brian, and Felicity, so it was logical that Trevor's parents would <br />
become the same way once altered. <br />
<br />
Breakfast had been a combination of sushi and steak. Then again, wolves and lions WERE <br />
exclusively carnivores, (Serenity wondered what havoc THAT played on the vegetarian <br />
scene). Serenity enjoyed some eggs that had been scrambled it seemed just for her. <br />
<br />
Serenity wondered how these two small seemingly numbered species (the lions not even <br />
having enough for short term survival though that would change very quickly soon <br />
enough) had done in competition in the work place with human beings. <br />
<br />
As Serenity would learn after a quick internet search was that the major reason lions and <br />
wolves hadn't completely overwhelmed humans in the work force was that while they <br />
could perform physical feats that for humans were limited to comic book super heroes, <br />
they didn't have the astounding level of endurance that had made humans into the most <br />
successful primate on the planet to begin with. <br />
<br />
That was when the entire breakfast had turned into a surprise trip to go get ice cream <br />
(hey, it was basically milk fat).  Serenity of course had been offered to, and had accepted <br />
to come. She was relieved when a random woman who talked about she loved Marie's fur, <br />
followed by how Marie loved her hair DID NOT result in a transformation into lion person. <br />
<br />
As Trevor had been munching down on Mint, while his sister had vanilla and his parents <br />
both cake-batter, and Serenity on Oreo, Trevor had practically dropped his ice cream <br />
seeing a teenager walk into the store with a blond girl on his arm and order a large <br />
sunday. <br />
<br />
Serenity hadn't said anything, but she did follow Trevor when Trevor follow the teenager <br />
into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Serenity didn't need to guess from the look in Trevor's eyes. She hadn't been nearly as <br />
surprised as she thought she'd be when Trevor had charged at the teenager claws and <br />
fanged bared when he had turned around from the stall (Serenity not bothering to think <br />
about how she was breaking some basic creeds by following). <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHATDAHELL-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU!&quot; Trevor didn't claw his eyes out, he just went straight for the throat, the larger foot <br />
ball league material teenager having tinny tiny cut marks on his throat now barely able to <br />
hold Trevor back.<br />
<br />
&quot;GETOFFMEKID-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU!!! YOU RUINED MY LIFE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHODAHELLAR-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TREVOR! REMEMBER? THE GUY YOU TURNED INTO A CAT AND GAVE A DEATH SENTENCE <br />
TO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;IHAVENOIDEAWHOYOUAREYOU--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T LIE TO ME YOU LITTLE-&quot;<br />
<br />
There was also the VERY REAL problem that Serenity had said that Trevor's attacker was <br />
dead. What was she supposed to say now? While Gill would understand (maybe) Trevor's <br />
parents might think her everything from a coconspirator to incompetent. But that was <br />
meaningless since Trevor was about to become a murderer. <br />
<br />
&quot;TREVOR! STOP!&quot; Serenity pulled the little feline away with her surprising amount of <br />
strength for an old woman her age but with two life time's worth of experience. <br />
<br />
&quot;HELP ME!!!&quot; Declared the teenager not realizing how good the walls were at holding in <br />
noise. <br />
<br />
&quot;LET ME GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Serenity looked at the teenager, &quot;He just went through a traumatic experience and I <br />
think he mistook you for his attacker, I suggest you go, and I also suggest you don't <br />
mention this to anyone unless you want everyone to know how you nearly got your butt <br />
handed to you by an eight year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teenager nodded and ran. <br />
<br />
&quot;He's getting away!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not you enemy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TO HELL HE ISN'T!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU NO LONGER MET HIM! Remember Trevor? How could he have ever cursed you to <br />
begin with if you've never even been in high school yet? He doesn't even know you in this <br />
reality!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor broke down crying, &quot;All my friends... I'll never... they'll never... they never knew me <br />
now... and I'll never get a chance to know them again... it's just... it's just.. it's just not <br />
fair-air-air!&quot; Trevor tried into Serenity's shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;There there... let it all out Trevor... let it all out.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Penny knew the moment she interacted with her parents to tell them about her near death <br />
experience and now being engaged they would be as much lions and would have always <br />
been just like Kirk's parents. But she wasn't about to try and cheat fate and had enough to <br />
think about now. <br />
<br />
Penny of course was in no condition to go to the police station when he was bound to a <br />
wheelchair for what would be the better part of a month. She had to know something and <br />
that wolf pup was the only one that could give her the answer. She was glad to learn that <br />
she was awake. Though she wasn't glad to hear she was not locked up.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Moshi-Moshi,&quot; Came chillingly familiar child's voice on the other end,<br />
<br />
Penny said, &quot;I have a question for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it lioness-san?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the museum you didn't transform some statues,&quot; Penny said. &quot;Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they were connected to you,&quot; Amy said. &quot;Even though it pained me not to set <br />
them free I left them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny nodded and asked, &quot;Why did you leave them if you were there to free?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The were connected to you by a red ribbon,&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Penny said nodding again. &quot;That must have been the packs true love power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is said that your true love is connected to you by a red ribbon,&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Penny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a Shinto priestess during World War Two,&quot; Amy said. &quot;Even though Ami is gone I still <br />
have some knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have to thank you for not taking Kirk from me,&quot; Penny said and smiled up at him. <br />
&quot;Now I need to go see how something went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're referring to the assault on the estate it didn't happen,&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then every wolf is still brainwashed,&quot; Penny said quietly and in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wolf is brainwashed,&quot; Amy said. &quot;That ended when I killed one of the three witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I need to hear this story,&quot; Penny said.<br />
<br />
Amy happily obliged her and told her everything about it that she knew.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Penny said she needed time to think about things and parted ways. <br />
<br />
Amy and Ami meanwhile, just hoped that as reality began to try and fix itself, that it didn't <br />
have to erase people from existence as an after thought. <br />
<br />
And Gill meanwhile called also, and by chance, Ami had picked up his office phone <br />
violating about a hundred procedures. What had followed was a very long and very harsh <br />
speech about Ami not respecting police procedure. But he had wanted to know the state of <br />
his men, women, whatever. When Ami listed off names, there were two she neglected. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gill asked, &quot;What about Elise and Fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead, they were killed giving Trevor-kun and the rest enough of a distraction that the <br />
white wolf could kill the thing's mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... dammit, damn this game, damn those stupid witches, damn this curse, damn the-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried to save them but... it seems that there are things I just can't do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me kiddo, I don't know if you're old enough to understand this, but you can't <br />
change the whole world, those damn witches didn't realize that but refused to accept that, <br />
don't go falling into the same trap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Gill-Sama.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;What about their kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tano and Moja both say that they and their siblings knew what their parents were getting <br />
into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to have Nellie and Nexi ... ah who am I kidding, this is family at this point.&quot; As <br />
much as Gill had to begrudgingly admit it, his pin-headed officers were now indeed a <br />
family, this was their business, not his beyond their scope of Elise and Fox being police <br />
under -his- command who he hadn't been there for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How's Gary taking it then kiddo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary-Sama seems more concerned with checking out on the rest of the pride to make <br />
sure they all pull through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill would go through the paper work to tell Fox and Elise's families tomorrow, and would <br />
only vaguely surprised when the paper work listed the pride as their immediate family <br />
(same with the pack being listed as Fran and Darla's). <br />
   <br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Lawrence would have ideally becomes twins (his twins selves had been named Quinn and <br />
Lance) but that would have created too much disruption to what reality had already put in <br />
place. <br />
<br />
As it was, Lawrence and Betty were in fact -hadn't- changed, at least on the outside. They <br />
actually joined Amethyst in her singing for a bit feeling quite young at heart. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; Check us out!&quot; The teenage Maxine said to the teenage Robyn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy it while we're able to remember being different sister.&quot; Robyn said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I guess I get to drive Millie crazy as a little sister almost!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I think, I think Millie's the same age as us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze how does that work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's chaos, it has to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when her fellow pink wolves Coral and Carelian came over and dull hugged her. <br />
<br />
The now teenage Opal and Caroline/Cobalt were cycling each other, not quite sure what to <br />
make of each other.  <br />
<br />
Amber was now a bare minimum teenager possible younger than Ulysses, but was just as <br />
dramatic and out going, she wondered if she'd get a larger chest this time when she <br />
reached adult hood (she was destine in fact to STILL be a flat chester). <br />
<br />
Emerald and Ruby were back to back surrounded by wild twins, looking somewhat like <br />
teenage twins themselves save for their different coloring in fur. <br />
<br />
The wild boys Jay and Pence (Jasper) were doing acrobatics around them.   The twins born <br />
of Topaz, Goldie, Carnelian, and Lazuli were covering Garnet ticking her like mad... <br />
however no matter how much Garnet laughed her lungs out she didn't split in two <br />
(somewhat to the twin's disappointment they didn't get to keep that super power).  'I... I... I <br />
wish was being smothered by Amethyst's giant bre-breasts again!!'  Garnet thought <br />
between gasps. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Moja, Mbili, Tatuli,Nneli, Tano, Sita, Saba, Nane cuddled with Mary as she rested.  Ulysses <br />
stood guard, or tried to as he feel asleep as well.  Sasha did barely any better just hoped <br />
that Maxine and Robyn would cool down on the flirting with Ulysses for a while, they all <br />
needed time to recover. <br />
<br />
'My friends,' Mary's thought awakening in the afternoon, still on the island, 'I never found <br />
out, did they alter with me? Or do I have new friends?' Mary felt her memories shifting, <br />
feeling the creed of doom that she would seen forget the friends she had a high schooler <br />
and would remember the friends she now had in grade school, so was the way reality <br />
chose to balance existence. And she knew one thing more in half-sleep, she was done <br />
trying to cheat existence, she had made her bed, and would now sleep in it. <br />
<br />
In her dreams she saw the pride together. Morning the death of two of their members and <br />
mothers. <br />
<br />
Felicity had hugged both Gary and Brian when they learned about Fox and Elise's deaths. It <br />
wasn't fair, the two lionesses with the most to live for were gone. Then again, life wasn't <br />
fair.  <br />
<br />
Mary gave the best hug she could to her four half-sisters. Moja, Mbili, Tatuli, and Nneili.  <br />
Gary meanwhile had hugged his daughters Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane for the loss of their <br />
mother.  <br />
<br />
Raising nine kids even between the four of them should have been impossible, except for <br />
the tiny fact they had never been alone, the pride had each other, and unlike their <br />
unevolved quadruped ancestors, each member of the pride male or female saw each cub <br />
weather they were their own or not as part of their responsibility and part of their legacy. <br />
So it hadn't been four people raising nine kids, it had been over a dozen adult lions <br />
raising nine cubs. <br />
<br />
All in all, they weren't that much different from the pack in terms of loyalty towards each <br />
other, though they didn't have a unified leader like the Alphas, each male lion had equal <br />
say. This wasn't to say they were sexist (they had ended that in the 1800s) but each side of <br />
the equation had their own responsibilities. <br />
<br />
(AN: Okay. Unknown. Your turn. Sorry for this part being so erratic. Hopefully my next part <br />
will be A LOT more smooth.)</p>
