<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the crap game went on, and Mitch's buddies slowly getting errect and and none of them wanting to be thought gay in front of each other, they slowly all seemed the calm down and chill out and one by one gave some sort of bad excuse to leave.<br />
<br />
As Mitch sat there trying to hide his obvious excitement and keep his tail from wagging. His last friend leaving not even waiting to say goodbye Mitch shut the door and locked it, and not a moment too soon, just as he shut the door, Reginald jumped him, getting a firm hold on Mitch's sweat pants with his teeth he tore and yanked them off of Mitch and in the process knocking Mitch to the ground.<br />
<br />
With Mitch on the ground, trying to get a foot hold to stand up Reg pounced on him, not giving Mitch the chance to stand up and walk away, Reg mounted him again, not wasting any time he began to pound away into Mitch.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sean had been sitting in his room full of anger over how Mitch had told him off, he really wanted to be able to go back to get that video game from the pawn shop. While he was sitting there in his anger this extremely sexy woman had been jogging passed his home and he took notice to this. The jogger was a young woman from what he guessed across town, she was about five foot nine inches tall, give or take, hard to tell at this distance, she had some nice wide hips, firm ass that jiggled and swayed in just the perfect way, about D cup breasts, her light brown hair had been done up into a ponytail but Sean guessed that it would about reach just passed her shoulder blades. As he watched this young and sexy jogger go by he said under breath &quot;Damn, i wish someone who lived near me with a body like that so i could see it more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Reg had been pounding away into Mitch for what seemed like hours now, and Mitch was too helplessly lost in this pleasure and strange need of what Reg was doing to take notice to this next set of changes that started to overwhelm him, but these unlike the one before only added to his pleasure.<br />
At first his body hair began to thin out and finally disappear leaving him completely hairless except for his new tail, and the hair around his 2nd groin, the changes from there moved to his body which began to slim out into a more feminine shape. <br />
His muscled body began to lose that and gain weight around his butt, hips, and thighs, while losing weight around his torso and waist.<br />
his butt slowly moved the new weight around to make that perfectly firm heart shaped ass, while widening his hips for child bearing and would also give him that perfect sway while his waist thinned out a little bit.<br />
His shoulders narrowed down, and became more slender, which moved all the way down to his finger tips which gave him daintier hands and at the same time smaller feet.<br />
The changes then moved to his head, it started with his hair growing out, which knocked his hat right off, his hair grew to the length so it would now touch the small of his back and also lightened just a tad for the lighter brown color.<br />
His face shaped up becoming more feminine and more girlish looking, and with this his voice had changed octaves which he could clearly here as he had begun moaning to Reg's pounding.<br />
The final change was his chest, already narrow and feminine looking, behind each of his eight nipples, he began to puff up and extend outward growing breasts, the areola's widened and then the fatty tissue behind his nipples began to puff outward, this change was bringing Mitch over the edge, drawing him closer and closer to an orgasm.<br />
Mitch's Penis had remained intact up to this point, when it started to shirk, and changed, it slowly got smaller and smaller until along with his balls, went inside his body, to begin forming a new Human vagina right atop his canine pussy, his breasts crept closer to their end, his top set was that perfect D cup that Sean had watched so closely, and each set after lost a cup size,(so D, then C, then B, then A) as the changes finished Mitch felt a huge build of pleasurable energy beginning to release, it was like flood gates being opened, and as they did Mitch screamed, having that long await orgasm right as Reg exploded into Mitch, both of them collapsing to the ground, and Mitch passed out shortly after hitting the tiled floor in front of his front door.</p>
