<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Aye Troy, that’s my rock star,” Mr. Andersen gripped Troy’s head with one thick dwarven hand, slamming his face against his musky pubes. “Gods you’re a good fuck.”<br />
<br />
Troy enjoyed the smell of his boss’s musk. His tail wagged eagerly behind him and Troy only slowed his bobbing for a brief second to wonder that he even had one before the thick juicy cock slammed itself down his throat again. Troy praised the Gods he lacked any gag reflex or he’d be choking! <br />
<br />
That thought brought his mind to a halt. Gods?<br />
<br />
Mr. Andersen shifted above Troy’s head, his furry musclegut brushing Troy’s head and lined up his cock in Troy’s mouth again. He grabbed Troy’s ears, stretching them, pulling them until something let go and the ears extended, covered in fur, into hyena ears. Then he resumed fucking, his breath coming ragged now. <br />
<br />
Troy knew he was close. He wasn’t sure how he knew that, but he let that thought go and twirled his tongue expertly around the Dwarf&#39;s tip. He had customers at the bar, after all. Couldn’t let the old dwarf take all his time.<br />
<br />
The dwarf gasped and shoved his cock as far in as he could, cock bucking inside Troy’s throat, semen sliding into his stomach. Troy crawled out from under the desk and stood, back popping. God, what had happened to his joints? He burped, enjoying the savory, earthy flavor of the dwarf’s cum, licking his blackening lips. Tasty. Troy patted his stomach and paused, feeling a bit of flab there. Was Mark making him chubbier?<br />
<br />
“Don’t feel bad, lad.” The Dwarf chuckled, noticing Troy patting his small belly, and pat his barrel shaped torso. “Middle aged spread is something we all go through.”<br />
<br />
Middle aged?! Had Mark taken his comment about Tavern Keepers being wholly jolly, fat and middle aged literally? That wasn’t what he’d agreed to! He was supposed to be an adventurer, how could he be an adventurer when his knees ached from a five minute BJ? <br />
<br />
Speaking of, Troy gave his knees a rub as the pain seemed to recede. It wasn’t that bad, like he’d gotten used to the pain. Why would he feel better all of a sudden? He noticed a strange copper band on his wrist. When had that gotten there? Had-<br />
<br />
Troy turned to the window of Mr. Andersen’s office and caught Mark making more notes just outside it. He waved at Troy when he saw him. Troy’s tail wagged behind him involuntarily and he found himself grinning and waving back. Mark moved on, likely to observe his performance at the tavern.<br />
<br />
So Mark was still adjusting things. Troy shook his head and checked his reflection. Nothing out of the ordinary, aside from his black lips, wagging tail covered in spotted fur, and hyena ears twitching at every sound, but they were feeling more normal every second. Mr Andersen finished freshening himself up and with only a look, dismissed Troy.<br />
<br />
Troy opened the door and stopped, staring. The entire office had changed. The concrete and plaster interior had entirely opened up, cubicles gone. Instead, the inner walls were now medieval style wood and waddle, like the inside of a tavern. Cubicles replaced with desks, printers that were now clockwork spouting scrolls made of lambskin. Computers were strange Arcanotech devices that fulfilled the same function. The tile floor now flagstone, windows grandstand glass things.<br />
<br />
It was fantastic. If this was the world Mark wished for, Troy was totally in. The drab office now seemed much more lively. Even the clothes looked different, more exotic materials being used, the fashion almost faux-modern, if that were a thing. Troy’s own clothes felt airier, looser fitting, cinched with a belt. He was certain they were silk.<br />
<br />
Troy found himself happily walking in the direction of the break room. His hips swished in a masculine swagger that felt forced but soon felt way more natural as he felt more confident, somehow. As he passed more supernatural office workers, he winked, smiled, nodded, and…for some reason, the women blushed and the men leered. He pulled the guitar from his back and started strumming a happy tune. <br />
<br />
His strumming came to a halt when he reached the break room.<br />
<br />
If the rest of the office had started to seem strange, the break room was the hardest hit of all. The room’s walls were gone and a new bar, filled with liquors familiar and exotic, lined the shelves. Several kegs of ale were on tap. It was circular, capable of servicing the entire office.<br />
<br />
To the side of the bar, a large board was against the wall. Dimly, Troy recognized it as a Quest Board. Where employees could scroll through the modern touch-screen inset into it and choose the quests at their leisure. Lining the walls were weapons of all kinds. What the hell kind of office was this?<br />
<br />
A few patrons-three elves and two bugbears-turned and waved cheerily at Troy. He waved back, not quite knowing their names but feeling them at the tip of his tongue. On a table near the back sat Mark, though he wasn’t writing about Troy right now. He seemed more intent on the tavern itself.<br />
<br />
He’s describing it in my back story, Troy thought. No wonder my changes slowed down. I still have a little time to be…mostly myself. I can still make choices as a Book owner.<br />
<br />
As Troy stepped behind the bar and hung up his guitar, he almost dropped it. Dustin was seated at one of the stools, glaring at him. Troy sighed. He was looking at the tail and ears. Something Troy had promised him. He decided it was time to solve the Dustin problem permanently.<br />
<br />
“You left me all alone in this weird bar and YOU GAVE YOURSELF A TAIL?” Dustin practically shouted. “You are a BAD OWNER!”<br />
<br />
Troy caught movement in the corner of his eye. Mark had stopped writing and was looking at them. As were all the other patrons. Troy closed his eyes and formulated a plan.<br />
<br />
“Are you listening to me?” Dustin snarled. “I DESERVE MY REWARD!”<br />
<br />
“I hear you pal. You’ve been a good boy, and I need you to keep calm for exactly one minute.” Troy nodded. “You have earned it, and I have been bad. Let me talk to Mark over there-”<br />
<br />
“No! Now!” Dustin barked.<br />
<br />
Troy moved to the Lost and Found box under the counter, shoved it to the side and found the box of dog treats they always kept around in case someone with a dog came in. He pulled a treat out and feigned surprise. <br />
<br />
“Oh! Is this yours?”<br />
<br />
Dustin stared. “Um. No. Did I drop it? Wait, is that a biscuit? Yes! I have been good! It’s definitely mine!”<br />
<br />
Troy handed it to him. While Dustin was busy gobbling it up happily, he made his way back to Mark, who had resumed writing. Mark looked up at his approach.<br />
<br />
“Someone dropped this off in the Lost and Found Box. It looked like your journal. Is this yours?” Troy held out the Book of Beasts.<br />
<br />
Mark’s jaw dropped. <br />
<br />
“The Book of-er, yes, that’s definitely mine!” He shakily held out his hand. <br />
<br />
Troy handed it over and watched the Book of Beasts and the Book of Myth flashed and merged together into a bigger, thicker book. The new...tome, now read “The Book of All Creatures”. Mark blinked and flipped through the Book, heaving a happy sigh. Troy saw his notes were still there, with even more blank pages for him to write on.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad I could help you out.” Troy smiled. <br />
<br />
“You have no idea.” Mark breathed as he leafed through the spells. “My campaign is going to be lit! Only four more.”<br />
<br />
“You lost more?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…let me know if you find anything like this.” Mark looked at him. “You deserve a reward.”<br />
<br />
“No, it’s fine. I couldn’t think of anything off the top of my head I could want.” Troy tapped his chin. “I&#39;m not sure how to put this, but I felt odd after Mr. Andersen called me in. Achey.”<br />
<br />
“Ah. So it turns out there is a middle-aged penalty. It’s only -1. Gave you a common item that’ll negate it.” Mark waved him off. “You know, you’re the only guy whose managed to…get so involved in your character creation.”<br />
<br />
“I just don’t want to end up a useless NPC.” Troy scratched an ear. “This job seems to take up all my time.”<br />
<br />
&quot;About that. I was doing some thinking and, well...&quot; Mark shrugged apologetically. “We’re kind of full. You know, as a party. So I figured a prominent NPC was the next best thing.”<br />
<br />
“Ah.” Troy was suddenly non-plussed. <br />
<br />
“Plus when I finish writing up your history, you won’t be interested in fighting anyways.” Mark smiled and wrote something down. “You’re a quest-giver, mostly.”<br />
<br />
Troy burped for the second time today, tasting cum and ale. He smiled and patted his padded stomach lightly, not noticing it bounce and swell a bit into a small beergut, feeling more mellowed. He always had an ale or two before work to keep the buzz going. <br />
<br />
“Right, yeah.” Troy grinned. “So about that reward. I was thinking...maybe you and I spend some quality time togather after work?”<br />
<br />
Mark grinned back. “That’s more in line of what I was thinking.”<br />
<br />
Troy turned to the bar, slightly off balance, little gut wobbling, and saw Dustin sitting there. He turned back, seeing Mark continue writing something down. He thought it looked like his ability scores. He&#39;d rather not have those adjusted without his involvement. Troy needed a distraction and Dustin...well, he was always a good distraction.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Mark, one last thing.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Mark rolled his eyes. “I won’t be able to finish your character if you keep interrupting.”<br />
<br />
“That guy at the bar thinks he’s a dog or something.” Troy said. &quot;Cause he was barking at me non stop over something or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Really?” Mark frowned. “Well maybe he is. Don&#39;t recognize him. Can you fetch me an ale? I’m famished.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and skipped to the bar. Dustin sat there, looking forlornly at the crumbs of the doggy treat. He perked up when Troy rounded the bar.<br />
<br />
“So is it time?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
As he spoke, Dustin’s tongue began to lengthen out of his mouth. Troy smiled and nodded. Dustin began bouncing in his seat, letting a floofy tail escape from his pants. It wagged happily.<br />
<br />
“When? When?” Dustin asked, his ears lengthening and folding over themselves, flopping cutely as he bounced. <br />
<br />
“Right now.” Troy nodded at patrons as they came in, giving them beers.<br />
<br />
Dustin slid off the stool, staggering, then his back popped audibly and he fell to all fours. He swayed, his clothes disintegrating, a collar wrapping around his throat, spikes popping from it. ‘Rex’. Dustin, pulled up his tags and stared at them dumbly.<br />
<br />
“But I’m nerrt.” Dustin coughed, his body swelled and bulge with muscles, doubling in size, like a small pony. “Nrrrrt. Rrrex!”<br />
<br />
Fur swept his form, short and bristly, in stark contrast to his floofy tail. Dustin growled and snarled as his face distended, teeth sharpening, muzzle pushing out. His eyes began to glaze as his muzzle pulsed and extended, pulling his skull forward. <br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he leaned back and began licking himself, human penis erect, turning red and growing longer. As he lapped and suckled on his growing red rocket, his muzzle popped out an inch at a time, The stench of wet, horny dog filled the air. Troy swore he could see the dome of Dustin’s skull begin to pulsate as his licks became more frantic. With a final crack, his muzzle extended fully and ribbons of healthy dog sperm shot from the tip of his doggy dick. <br />
<br />
Dustin looked up at Troy with human eyes one last time, licking his cum off his chops, jaws opening as if to say something. <br />
<br />
Then his eyes shot wide, the dome of his skull wobbling. He whimpered as the slope of his forehead slowly collapsed, brain shrinking. Troy swallowed, mouth suddenly dry, as Dustin’s eyes became glassy, then the pupil spread, and then it was just a dog staring at him, panting contentedly, cum drooling from his spent cock onto the floor in a puddle. <br />
<br />
“Did you get that ale?” Mark’s voice piped up near Troy’s elbow.<br />
<br />
Troy composed himself and turned. “Sorry. Rex had an accident.”<br />
<br />
“Dogs do that.” Mark pulled out his book. “But at least he isn’t barking anymore.”<br />
<br />
“There is that.” Troy nodded.<br />
<br />
“So the Tavern’s done, has a dog like all good taverns do, now to finish this Gnoll write up.” Mark mumbled. “And then I can finish up the Tavern Keep himself.”<br />
<br />
Troy shuddered, hearing the pencil resume its scribbling. He was gonna need another beer.</p>
