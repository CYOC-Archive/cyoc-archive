<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday was much the same as Sunday but a full crew was there to work on stuff, despite this, Jeff&#39;s focus was still on work during his aware time and any analysis he could do was directed toward optimizing his workload and still getting the same quality.<br />
{------------------------------------------------------------------}<br />
Wednesday, Jeff was now 24. His mind reeled from the passing of another year as he recalled he had Tuesday&#39;s and Thursday&#39;s off, but as a stable shift now that he had some seniority under his belt. His scheduled break now nearly over, he exhaled a cloud of smoke and tried to recall where he left off several days ago.<br />
He had induced an awareness skip by taking the day off, and that client kerfluffle kept him too busy to think about his computer. He needed to pay rent, and the electric bill will be due soon. He wanted to call his buddy Matt and catch up over drinks in the near future. Maybe that bar/pizzeria down the street would be a good meetup place. The idiot could get a lot more action if he wasn&#39;t so hung up on maintaining a relationship, would break his heart less too. Wait, that&#39;s all unaware Jeff stuff.<br />
Jeff took a quick account of things that changed and realized his history now had a bit more mechanical focus, he owned a cheap motorcycle, a few more tattoos adorned him and he had not needed a roommate too long after turning 21. Its possible that his new age at that time opened up new conversations with people. He has a friend who is into cars and they work on stuff together and drink as part of their hang out time, its been going on for the last few years and Jeff has picked up quite a bit.<br />
Jeff shook his head as he returned to work, that won&#39;t do him any good with trying to get back to being a teenager. Is that what he wants? He can decide what to do after he has access to the machine, but in any case, he needs to get to the machine first. What he needs is someone who can force his hand. At some point in the past Jeff recalled upgrading his personal computer to a laptop, but all he really uses it for is YouTube videos and streaming from his pc to his TV.<br />
Jeff shot his mom a text, &quot;Hey, call me tonite n make sute I open th Chronivac progam on my compute! Thx&quot; Jeff hit send as he returned to his post. Jeff spent the rest of his aware time congratulating himself on his flash of insight and envisioning how it will play out and why it would succeed.<br />
{------------------------------------------------------------------}<br />
Friday Jeff was now 25. His Wednesday plan hinged on his unaware self following orders and he underestimated how distractable he could get. His sister called while he was cooking dinner then they got to talking and catching up with family matters, then he needed to eat, but between bites she asked about his relationships and chided him not to be so set on swearing off commitment.<br />
Jeff paused, &quot;Sister?&quot; He did some mental math and realized his sister was just 17 when he was born, err, former mother... for a sister that is a big age gap but for a mom its too small without causing problems. To convolute things as much as possible, her role change from mother to sister happened last night, so the original conversation was with his mom but now became a similar conversation with his sister.<br />
Jeff had slipped outside unconsciously and was smoking before he even realized he started his break. &quot;So that means...&quot; Jeff replayed his memories of his parents which used to be his grandparents on his mother&#39;s side. The reality rewrite was far reaching this time. Jeff hadn&#39;t noticed how much had been changing in other people&#39;s lives to cater to the rules of his new realities.<br />
When and how his parents met had been college, which had mutated into high school sweethearts. His brother-in-law/original father&#39;s life had to have his family move to the same town as his sister/mother to make a high school romance possible. But with Jeff shifted up a generation, the pressure forcing those pieces into those places released and their marriage returned to around the original timeframe. Now, his new parents had a very late oopsie-baby and had to put off retirement savings and plans to support him.<br />
Jeff reconciled this with the fact that he will probably keep aging and that will align him closer to his his sibling&#39;s ages to make him have been less of a burden. In this reality he barely knew his former father at all. He had been his sister&#39;s boyfriend from the time that Jeff was nine or 10, and aside from family gatherings he didn&#39;t really think of him. Yeah, the guy made him an uncle but he&#39;s more interested in his niece than him.<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; His place in his original family was replaced by his niece. It wasn&#39;t a problem to Jeff, but was a shock. The weirder thing was that he thought of his sister and brother in law as people in their 30&#39;s though he knew that was off. Their ages haven&#39;t changed but from his vantage point in this reality he saw them pull their lives together as individuals, not just as his parents.<br />
{------------------------------------------------------------------}<br />
The skeleton crew shifts over the weekend were busy like last weekend, though not quite as hectic. Still he only had a moment or two with his thoughts before he was interrupted. Sunday was a little interesting because he remembered his 5th anniversary having happened, but like his original hiring, it was part of the 6 months he didn&#39;t directly live.</p>
