<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley and Sarah continued their way down the hall, towards the building’s exit. However, just as they turned the corner, the two women saw a short balding man dressed in a nice grey suit walking their way.<br />
<br />
“Oh crap,” Sarah muttered under her breath, catching the attention of Ashley.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, girl?” She said in reply.<br />
<br />
“It’s the principal of this dumb place. He’s probably come to fire me.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Ms. Dunn, hello. Who is your friend here?&quot; the principal said with a stern expression, crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um, well...&quot; Sarah began stuttering. She knew she was already on thin ice with the administration due to her lax teaching style, and she worried that bringing a friend to class to hang out with might be the last straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there, I&#39;m... the new cheerleading coach, remember?&quot; She greeted somewhat unsure of herself. Her lie was unbelievable, even to herself, but luckily the ring&#39;s magic managed to make the lie into reality. Immediately her outfit began to shift. Around her tank-top a jacket formed, it&#39;s red stripes containing the name of the school. Her jeans quickly shot up, transforming into Soffe shorts with the word &quot;cheer&quot; in all caps wrapped around her ass. A whistle appeared around her neck and her blonde hair became tied into a tight bun.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, obviously it&#39;s me, we already met!&quot; Ashley added, somewhat offended that her knew boss apparently didn&#39;t remember her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wa- oh! Oh of course, my apologies Ms. Carter.&quot; The principal stuttered. He rubbed his balding head before straightening his glasses. &quot;I must have not gotten enough sleep last night.&quot; He wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, anyway, it&#39;s been nice but me and Ms. Carter should be on our way.&quot; Sarah jumped in, trying to avoid whatever the principal was about to talk about previously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, not so fast!&quot; He tried to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look come on George, do we really gotta do this now?&quot; Sarah asked, clearly upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we do.&quot; He grumbled, crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot; Ashley groaned, annoyed but also worried for her friend&#39;s job. It was her efforts that even landed Ashley&#39;s job here to begin with so she owed her one. She figured she&#39;d to sass this old fart before laying into him. &quot;Lighten up girlfriend!&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Instantly, Ashley felt a tiny amount of vertigo for a moment as the world shifted. The principal shot down to only about 5 feet tall before growing slightly taller once more as his business shoes became high heels. The edges of brown hair that surrounded his head just above his ears spread out into a neatly managed pixie cut. He aged down to their age, being about 24, and then he became a she. Moderate C cup breasts emerged under his suit, his hips widened, ass inflated in a new miniskirt, and finally his penis transformed into a vagina, moving up to where it belonged in her body.<br />
<br />
The new principal blinked a few times, as if confused before regaining her train of thought and looked at her two besties with sad eyes.<br />
&quot;Like, I&#39;m sorry Sarah... I&#39;m not gonna fire you obviously.&quot; She whispered. &quot;But like, I&#39;m one of the youngest principal&#39;s in Stone harbor High&#39;s history! I can&#39;t let some of our tenured teachers go blabbing to the superintendent.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright.&quot; Sarah muttered. &quot;I&#39;ll try to be a little more serious with my work ethic.&quot; She said with an eye roll, not wanting to make her friend cry, as she was very prone to doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you thank you thank you Sarah!&quot; She giggled, hugging her friend before running off. &quot;By girls!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Later Georgia, I mean, Ms. Smith!&quot; Ashley laughed. &quot;How did she ever manage to land this job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, she&#39;s only this open with her emotions with us.&quot; Sarah responded. &quot;Plus you know her, study all day party all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I remember.&quot; Ashley laughed, thinking back to their sorority days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry you gotta look after some kids now.&quot; Sarah apologized as the two began to walk once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh it&#39;s fine, I&#39;m an expert cheerleader. Besides, It&#39;s not the whole group of 30 at once. It&#39;s still early in the year, so we start with smaller groups with different sets each day. It&#39;s just 4.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s not bad then.&quot; She agreed as the two reached the exit. &quot;See you girl!&quot; She said, hugging Ashley close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later Sarah!&quot; She laughed, hugging her back.<br />
<br />
Ashley made her way back towards the inside of the school. She walked the quiet after class halls until she reached the back exit nearest to the gym. She made it outside and spotted four seniors doing stretches in the grass.<br />
<br />
First there was Hailey. Typical queen bee who reminded Ashley of herself back in the day. She had a killer figure, bright blonde hair and an even brighter future. She killed it in school, though her perfectionist nature sometimes lead to some trouble at home. An absent father certainly did not help.<br />
<br />
Beside her was Tyler. He was a tall, muscular African American boy who, if he had been in school with Ashley, she would have been all over. Of course, he was also gay, so it wouldn&#39;t have worked out. He was in the middle of making sure his curly locks were well kept behind a red headband he now wore.<br />
<br />
Next was Julia. She was a cute Asian girl and was the shortest of the bunch. She had short jet black hair, an alright build but a very prominent bottom which pressed against thicker thighs. She was removing her glasses and squinting at the lack of clarity. Against the stereotype, she was quite a ditz, always forgetting important things when it was least helpful, though she meant well.<br />
<br />
Finally there was Veronica, an average student all around. She was average height, average build, average dark haired brunette who wasn&#39;t the smartest but wasn&#39;t the dumbest either. She was also the middle child of 5. She always tried to stand out, often lashing out in the process. While Hailey was the obvious cheer captain, Veronica was the meaner right hand who wouldn&#39;t hesitate to gossip. As she tied her hair into pigtails, in another attempt to stand out, she spotted Ashley walking this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, finally!&quot; She greeted rudely. &quot;Come on coach, we don&#39;t got all evening.&quot; Veronica scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy girl, I&#39;m coming.&quot; Tyler defended her.<br />
<br />
 Ashley sighed with an eye roll, then greeted the group. &quot;Hello everyone! Today, I wanna evaluate each of you individually, maybe give some advice and pointers. I&#39;ll go one by one, and in the mean time while waiting the rest can just work on some of the exercises I showed you at the start of the year.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes coach.&quot; They all greeted with various degrees of enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
As they all began to do some of their favorite poses and tricks, Ashley wondered who&#39;d she talk with first. While she thought, she absentmindedly played with the ring on her finger, which she still had no idea could change reality with just a few words from her. No idea that any lies she tells her students could change everything they were.<br />
<br />
So, who does she choose? Or does something else happen beforehand?&quot;</p>
