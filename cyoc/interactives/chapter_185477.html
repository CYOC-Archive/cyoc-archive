<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You took a long time. Did my princess oversleep?&quot; your father said when you joined him at the table.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t want to lie to your father, mainly because he helped give you a much better life than your previous incarnation, so you hesitated a bit before answering. &quot;Yeah, I was so looking forward to my birthday last night that I had a hard time falling asleep.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really what happened?&quot; your father asked<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t like it, you were lying to your dad and he was already suspicious. But you also feared his reaction to learning about your new addition. You couldn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
The smile on your father&#39;s face then faded and he sent most of the employees out of the room, leaving only those he considered extremely trustworthy. He looked at Jenny with a seriousness you&#39;d rarely seen when it came to your business. &quot;Tell me Jenny, did that happen?&quot; he asked the maid<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir, the thing you feared happened.&quot; Jenny answered him, leaving you confused not knowing what they were talking about.<br />
<br />
Your father then looked at you and said with a sad tone &quot;I&#39;m sorry Alicia, I&#39;m really sorry. I hoped we&#39;d been able to prevent you from having such a big dick and balls. Now hardly anyone will accept to become your fiancé.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were totally taken aback by what your father said, he not only already knew about your dick but apparently already expected it to grow. On second thought, you remembered that Jenny wasn&#39;t surprised when she saw your dick earlier, which was the least that should be expected from someone who saw someone very close having undergone such a change. You liked your father and Jenny and was grateful for everything they did for you, but you had a lot of experience with this in your past life and felt annoyed because you felt like you had been deceived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough of that, I think you owe me some explanation. How did you know I was going to grow a dick, especially one this big?&quot; you asked them, with your sudden movements making your dress slip a little bit, but just enough that the tip of your dick could be seen coming out over your breasts by your father, but you didn&#39;t bother to hide it, as he already knew everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand your irritation, I would also feel cheated if I were in your shoes. I&#39;ll tell you everything, you have a right to know what happened to you.&quot; your father said<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I hope this is a very convincing explanation.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the story started a long time ago, before I got engaged to your mother. It turns out that whenever people say anything about your mother&#39;s family it&#39;s all a lie, we never know anyone on her side of the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean you don&#39;t know my mother&#39;s family?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Please miss, listen carefully and you will understand.&quot; Jenny said<br />
<br />
&quot;I was 12 years old when I met your mother, she was an orphan who lived on the street and stole from others to survive, but when she tried to steal from my father she was captured by our bodyguards. I was together and I saw everything, and seeing the conditions she was in and that my father wanted them locked in a dungeon, I intervened in her defense. It was the first time I was going against a decision of my father who, seeing the courage I had, decided to listen to what I had to say in her defense. I managed to convince him to forgive her and, to prevent her from stealing again, that we would hire her as one of the family maids.&quot; your father said<br />
<br />
&quot;This story sounds like a fairy tale, to some extent I imagine my mother as a Cinderella.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is Cinderella?&quot; your father asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a character from a children&#39;s story that Alicia met in her previous life. She told me that after that terrible headache she had on her 5th birthday she ended up regaining memories of her past life.&quot; Jenny said<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you remember your previous life? That&#39;s interesting, but it&#39;s not the main topic, so we&#39;ll let her talk more about it another day.&quot; your father said before resuming what he was telling about your mother. &quot;As I was saying before, your mother worked for us as a maid and for us she was very good, especially to me who she often said she was grateful for helping her to get a better life. We became really good friends and we used to be together when the two of us were free, over time we ended up falling in love with each other, which led to our marriage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I&#39;ve heard I can&#39;t understand what this has to do with the fact that I have an 18 inch cock between my legs now.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and for you to understand better, how about we go meet your mother so she can explain the details better. I believe you don&#39;t remember her and you must have thought she died, but she is alive and closer than you think.&quot; your father said<br />
<br />
&quot;If she&#39;s alive why has she never come to see me?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll understand when you see her.&quot; Jenny said<br />
<br />
Your father got up and went to the exit of the room asking you to follow him. You left the mansion and started walking through the garden towards a labyrinth that was maintained by the gardener, but it was also the only place on the grounds that your father had forbidden you to go saying that there were many poisonous plants there and he didn&#39;t want you to leave it get lost there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Continuing our story, your mother was not the only one who wanted to marry me, there was another girl who was the daughter of another noble family. When she learned that I had chosen her mother as my bride, she refused to accept that I would marry a maid and did everything to separate us, but she couldn&#39;t. The worst happened on our wedding day, just as I put the ring on your mother&#39;s finger.&quot; your father told you as he led you through the maze, stopping when you came to a larger area where there was a house you had no idea existed,  there was even a small stream that ran in that part of the maze and right next to the house. He knocked on the door and said &quot;Open the door, it&#39;s me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A minute later the house door was opened by a maid you had never seen in your mansion, you and your father walked in and she locked the door behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We came to see Flora, where is she?&quot; your father said<br />
<br />
You were guided by the maid to the second floor to a room that had the doors closed. <br />
<br />
Your father opened the door of the room indicated by the maid and went in saying &quot;Darling, what we feared happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
You entered right behind and saw your father hugging the woman he said was your mother, but there was something about her that you had never expected and it took you by surprise. Just like you after waking up your mother also had a dick, but hers was much bigger than yours, being clearly more than twice the size. Her balls were also giant, as her testicles were the size of beach balls.<br />
<br />
Your mother then looked at you and hugged you saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Alicia my daughter. We wanted to keep you from going through this, we wanted to break the curse before you turned 18.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curse? What are you talking about?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you tell her dear?&quot; your mother asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I was telling the story but stopped the moment I placed the ring on her finger. I think you will know how to count better after this point.&quot; your father said<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; your mom said to your dad, then she looked at you and said &quot;Pay attention to me Alicia, because what I&#39;m going to tell you now may be hard to believe. During my marriage to your father, as soon as he put the ring on my finger, I immediately felt pressure between my legs and my cock and balls grew, as the dress I was wearing wasn&#39;t that big and sturdy. my male member opened a hole and was exposed, hard in front of me for all the guests to see. &quot;It was 20 inches long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think your dick is 20 inches long, it seems to be a lot more.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because of the curse&#39;s effect. It turns out that when I underwent the transformation I was very confused and not knowing what to do, and the other girl who wanted to say that she liked her father revealed herself laughing. She then said that she had cursed our rings so that once placed on my finger she would give me a dick and balls, she also said that any female offspring we had would be hit by the same curse when they turn 18. To make matters worse what defines the size of our dick is our age and it is always the same amount of inches long as the years of life you have.&quot; your mother said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute? Is that why my cock is 18 inches? Just because I turned 18?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, and since I&#39;m 40 years old, you can already imagine the size of mine, right.&quot; And since I&#39;m 40 years old, you can already imagine the size of mine, right. &quot;Every birthday your dick&#39;ll get an inch bigger. just as your balls will get bigger, your cum production will increase and so will your libido. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been living away from you this whole time. I didn&#39;t want you to see me as a freak, especially with my libido getting higher and I didn&#39;t want you to have me jerk off by accident in some corner of the mansion.&quot; she completed<br />
<br />
&quot;We tried to capture that woman and make her undo the curse, but us she just disappeared into thin air in front of everyone and since then we&#39;ve never seen her again.&quot;  your father said<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean she disappeared?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Turns out she was a witch all along and wanted to take a position in the upper class, so she wanted to marry your father. As her plans were thwarted she got back by putting the curse on our family. After that day we found out that she wasn&#39;t actually the real daughter of the other couple of nobles, but just bewitched them to believe they were her parents. After she disappeared the spell was broken and the couple didn&#39;t even remember her. It seems that even her name was fake, which hinders any search.&quot; your mother said<br />
<br />
&quot;Even not finding her I&#39;ve been looking for someone who can break the curse before you turn 18, but we failed.&quot; your father said</p>
