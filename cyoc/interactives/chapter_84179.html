<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking over your options you quickly eliminate the octopus since you probably would not be able to keep up with the extra limbs.<br />
<br />
Though you saw the crocodile&#39;s victory but not his style you are quite intimidated.<br />
<br />
Gorillas are quite strong and agile so not him.<br />
<br />
A regular kangaroo can give a person a concussion with their kicks.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know anything about how the hippo will fight so he will undoubtedly startle you which could end you.<br />
<br />
If the eagle can fly you&#39;ll be at a huge disadvantage.<br />
<br />
And bears terrify you.<br />
<br />
That leaves the T-Rex. Since he probably isn&#39;t allowed to use his teeth in the match for obvious reasons that removes the biggest threat from him, also he does have small arm range so you just have to watch out for kicks.&quot; I&#39;ll  fight the Tyrannosaurus Rex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, if you had waited five more seconds it would have been a special match.&quot; the girl says in disappointment.&quot;all right but since we do need to wait a few minutes for the intermission.&quot;<br />
<br />
After leading you to the back you are left in a locker-room with a green wrestling singlet and instructions to put it on and nothing else you see a laptop. Opening it up you see it is open to some files on the wrestlers. You are intrigued by the T-Rex&#39;s file.<br />
<br />
His real name is James Higlez. You don&#39;t know where the last name is from but it sounds cool. His stage name is The Blast From The Past, not very original is your opinion on the name. Looking over his file further you see he is a bit of a nerd though that probably won&#39;t help much. Then you find what you had been looking for.Stats and footage.<br />
<br />
After watching a few matches you have his style down (jab and kick then surprise with tail swing, after that pin attempt and if it fails head but and flip them over) after coming up with a strategy to counter his you strip and put on the singlet. You are slightly concerned about how little it covers your package (7&quot; soft) but decide to spend the rest of the time warming up. Three minutes later the girl came into the locker-room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for your match.&quot;she says with a smile.<br />
<br />
Once you get into the ring  you can see James in all his glory. 7&#39;8&quot; tall he was intimidating, a rather large bulge in his very pale red singlet,practically pink, which had a little different design since it had little sleeves that looked like they were from a T-Shirt and not actually attached to the rest of the outfit with similar ones on his ankles and a spandex belt on his waist. With a well muscled body to boot. You are intimidated but steel yourself, and thank god your parents had you take karate lessons for  years. You also see a few random items within reach of the ring, which are to spice up the matches.<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later.<br />
<br />
You stand on top of James, panting somewhat. Both of your singles had tears in them. Yours along the left abdomen, right leg, upper chest, and one that was dangerously close to your penis, several across the back from him clawing at you, with other smaller tears scattered across you have more than a few scratches and cuts across your body. Unlike him you don&#39;t have any real claws so it wasn&#39;t as torn as much as yours was. However due to the what happened it will require some explanation. Well the first damage happened when he sent a jab at you I leaned back to dodge then planning to use this to your advantage grabbed the upper left section and pulled with the intention of swinging back up, however the fabric was not very strong so snapped at the strap, not really helping. Then thinking fast you let your feet slide out from under you and you end up on the Rex&#39;s other side though on the floor. Quickly getting to your feet you make a jab a his shoulder, succeeding you backpedal out of range and with a quick observation see that by sliding beneath you tore his outfit more, you could now see 3 of his 8 pack and a rather impressive peck. Then when he sprinted at you he clawed at your abdomen before you could stop him and you respond by punching him in the face. Second was after I found out his scales did not make good purchase like before you were dodging a jab and grab the singlet&#39;s top part but on the other side, like before it tore but this time you were expecting it and while it tears you pull him closer to you and and into a punch. With that now gonethe top half of his gear now hung to his knees. Getting angry he rips off both the remaining front and the back and threw them to the side. You can now see his muscled top half in all its glory, and with all that muscle it was quite a bit with those large pecks. And with a burst of ragecame charging at me again. Third and final damage was after he charged at me, he pushed me down right near the edge of the ring and grabbed a hammer. looking for something to use you grab something and hit James&#39;s face with it. What you grabbed was a fish. Both of you were surprised, then you nock the hammer out of his hands and sprint around to his back and shoved. He fell face first into the ropes which he became tangled up in. Face towards the audience back to me, upside down. Getting a devious idea you climb up a the ropes a little and then grabbing the seat of what were no the rex&#39;s shorts, you jump back and pull down. Now receiving the wedgie of his life James eyes squinted shut in pain. When you land you hear a klink and glancing down seeing a pair of hand cuffs. You get another idea. When Rex realized that he no longer wore shorts.<br />
<br />
There he was, Blast From The Past, upside down, tangled, flashing his asshole and his dangling penis to the audience. Feeling humiliation he blushed, closed his eyes and since his legs were being kept forcefully spread by the rope and though his arms weren&#39;t caught up in the rope they weren&#39;t  and long enough to cover his ass and putting them on his penis wouldn&#39;t cover much and more likely make it look like he was jerking off. So covering his privates instead with his tail he felt you pulling on the belt. Getting angry he lashes out at you with his tail but that just put him in your trapwhich caught his tail in the belt. Then using the cuffs which you loop through the belt on his wrists, you trap them just by his his tail. The belt is obviously made of a very strong and stretchy material.<br />
<br />
Seeking to add to his humiliation you start to stroke his penis, making him aroused. after two minutes of this and squirming BFTP gets untangled and manages to fall into the ring. While he was squirming you found something else to use, a flashlight. As he manages to get onto his knees. But he can&#39;t get balanced enough to stand up. So his ass is just sticking up in the air. The flashlight has bungee cords ending in hooks to hook together.you walk over to James and shove a quarter of the flashlight in right away. Eyes watering in pain you whisper to him&quot;just relax or it will hurt a whole lot more.&quot; he whimpers but nods his head.<br />
<br />
You now push the flashlight in more slowly and since you feel so little resistance you decide he deserves a reward and stroke his cock. Now feeling more pleasure than pain and having lost the will to fight back, he starts to moan. Once you have the flashlight all the way in you begin piston it in and out, now moaning loudly James has given up and just let you do what with him.<br />
<br />
Deciding it was long enough you step away from BFTP, then jump on his back driving his legs out from under him.one of his hands instinctively swings and comes dangerously close to slicing your penis before you grab it. Angry you then grab the fish from earlier and start spanking him furiously with it. You do so a few dozen times then pin him down for three seconds, winning the match. After the match a few doctors come out and take Blast From The Past backstage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like you won.&quot;said the girl from earlier&quot; If you want your prize come backstage.&quot; And with that she walked off. When she was near the door she said&quot;you coming or what.</p>
