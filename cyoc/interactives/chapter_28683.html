<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No, that's OK,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Bob. She felt a sensation that while she knew she haden't of felt it before, she somehow knew that it was. She was attracted to Bob!<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I dunno, I'm interested in this life and how I've done as a girl,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Bob shook his head. &quot;This is crazy. I'm serious when I say that I remember you as a girl! I just can't think of you as a guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris took the necklace into her hands and had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what would happen if you put this on?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Bob looked at the necklace. &quot;What if it turns me into a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris touched her chest and grinned. &quot;Arn't you curious about what having these feels like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little but there's something else I don't want to lose,&quot; Bob said.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Bob's crotch. She felt annoyed to lose the part that made her a guy. The only access she'd have to such a part now would be on guys! She didn't like the idea of that at all. Although, she didn't mind the idea of having access to a girl's parts 24/7.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, OK, I can understand that. But, I dunno, I'm not sure what to do. I guess I could use a shower,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
A part of her wanted to ask Bob to come in there with her. The male version of her would never do that. She'd even find the idea disgusting. Now however, without someone to stop them, Chris found herself considering the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to then OK. I'll wait,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Bob once again. If it was true, then from his point of view, she was acting strange. It saddened her to think that the Chris that Bob new was in a sense gone. It reminded her of time travel movies where the person doing the time traveling changed history and everything was different when they came back. If they didn't eventually remember things as they ended up, they'd be a stranger that from everyone's point of view, replaced the version of them everyone knew.<br />
<br />
Yet, she also remembered parts from this reality when Bob mentioned them and he when kissed her. She wondered if asking Bob to shower with her was something she would normally do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob, wait, I need to try something,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you um, like to shower with me?&quot; Chris asked. She felt a tingle run down her spine at the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I mean, er um,&quot; Bob said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK, if it's something you woulden't mind doing then say yes,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? Of course I would!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt another twinge of memory. She'd wanted to ask Bob to do this before but was too shy. She knew that Bob would never ask for it, even if was something he wanted. However, inside, she felt that giving into these feelings would be a betrayal of her manhood. She cursed the fact that things that were wrong had a way of being the ones that felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I ... this isn't fair to you,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so? Since when is seeing you naked not fair to *me*,&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what if I am insane? It's not fair that the person you knew is gone and someone else is in her place,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but what if you're not insane? What if all of the rest of us are? What if everything you know is changed?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, I just don't know! Damn it, I find myself wanting to do something kinky but I also remember being to shy to go through with it. It's like things I wanted to do with girls when I was a guy. Those things have just changed to stiff a girl version of me would want to do,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Something clicked in Chris' mind with that. Now she remembered having the urges but never giving into them. There were times that she wanted to do various things with Bob. One of them involved a bottle of whipped cream (or perhaps chocolate sauce), her breasts and Bob's tongue. A part of her still shuddered at the idea of *having* breasts, let alone doing something pleasurable with them. It panicked her as such thoughts, to her just didn't belong in her mind. She wasen't supposed to actually be able to do these things with someone, let alone Bob!<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, I care about you enough that I don't want us to do something that will make you uncomfortable. Look, why don't you go and take your shower. Maybe the water will relax you and help you focus,&quot; Bob said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, OK,&quot; Chris said. Taking the necklace, Chris handed it to Bob. &quot;Here, hold this. Just don't wear it unless you want it to turn you into a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; Bob said as he took the necklace.<br />
<br />
Chris walked back upstairs, looking at the altered pictures along the way and shaking her head. She walked right to the bathroom and stripped, throwing her clothes to the ground. Turning the tap water on, she made sure the temperature was right before she activated the shower.<br />
<br />
She took a minute to look at herself in the mirror in all her nudity. She felt as though she were seeing something she wasen't allowed to see. A part of her wanted to go and get Bob and to let him run his hands down her body, lathering it with soap. She felt a tingling between her legs at that thought. However, when it came to following through with that desire, she just coulden't do it.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the shower, Chris felt the water hit her body for the first time as a female. She noticed several things that were different yet at the time, the same in a sense. There was a bottle of body lotion that Chris somehow knew was hers. She picked it up, popped open the cap and sniffed it. It had a vanilla scent that sparked new memories as she poured it onto the puff.<br />
<br />
Now, Chris remembered showering as a female. As she ran the puff over her breasts and belly, she started forgetting what it was like to have chest hair. When she got to the part of her body that made her female, she remembered what it was like to have that part. Then, Chris realised that she remember what it was like to have a penis! She knew where it would be but she could only imagine how having one felt!<br />
<br />
By the time she'd washed her entire body, she felt natural in it. She remembered not having breasts as a child rather then up until the previous day. The memories of being a boy in the past were gone, replaced with those of being a girl. Connected memories, those of where her female form didn't belong such as in the boy's change room altered to fit her new form. Rather then wondering what went in the girls change room as a boy, she now remembered it as wondering what went in the boy's change room!<br />
<br />
After washing her hair, Chris stepped out of the shower, her mind reeling.<br />
<br />
She still knew that she used to be male but was starting to have trouble remembering it as little more then just a set of words.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the bathroom after drying herself, Chris looked into her bedroom mirror. Now, she coulden't remember seeing her male self looking back at her. In fact, she coulden't remember what she looked like as a guy!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm becoming this version of me a little more each second,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Remembering Bob was still downstairs, Chris was about to get dressed when an idea hit her. She considered running downstairs naked. While a part of her would want to run around naked or let Bob lick whip creamed of off her breasts, she could never bring herself to ask him to do it.<br />
<br />
Chris picked out a pair of panties from her dresser. As a male, the idea of wearing panties had seemed odd to her. Now however, they seemed natural. In fact, the idea of wearing boxers or briefs was just as strange to her now. She knew that she had changed, but coulden't seem to remember how that aspect of her used to be. After putting on a bra (something that also now felt natural. She'd feel naked without one), she dressed in a pink teeshirt and the jeans from before.<br />
<br />
Walking downstairs, Chris approached Bob.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you feel?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, I ... I don't know. I can't seem to remember what it's like to be a guy. I remember always having this body now. Yet, I still remember what I mentioned. It's confusing,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to do? If you're remembering more of the way thing are now, maybe this is meant to be? I mean, it's weird for me to think of you as a guy friend rather then a girlfriend. Yet, if that's the way it was and I'm missing out on stuff, then maybe we should find a way to reverse this,&quot; Bob said.<br />
<br />
For Chris however, she wasen't sure what she wanted. She knew that as a male, she'd never be able to bear children. Now, even if she wasen't sure it's what she wanted, she was glad to have the option of it.<br />
<br />
Chris found herself facing a dilemma and wondered what to do next.</p>
