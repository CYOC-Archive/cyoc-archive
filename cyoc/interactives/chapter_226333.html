<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i><b>The Veil of Isis</b>. This powerful magical object held by Oracles in ages past didn&#39;t, as most people thought, help the Oracles to divine the future, but instead, made sure that their predictions came to pass.</i><br />
<br />
Dustin had a singular dream - to be a thickly diapered toddler cuddled up warm and safe in the hairy, rippling arms of a big strong Daddy. Not content to let such a beautiful scenario remain stuck in his imagination, the engrossed young man dedicated his life to discovering some way to re-write reality to his whims. The universe itself seemed to answer his efforts when a small parcel with no return address showed up on his doorstep one day, when he opened it to find a square sliver of parchment within. The rough, dry material was framed by a pattern of inlaid gold, much older than the roughly torn off scrap of paper that contained hand-scrawled instructions on the use of the strange relic. Dustin&#39;s initial reaction was to find this all ridiculous, of course, but the directions were so simple that he could spare the few seconds to try the Veil out before dismissing its supposed powers. What&#39;s more, he had to admit that he grew very excited as he scribbled down the stimulating details of the sexual fantasy that had been his sole obsession since before he even knew what sex was.<br />
<br />
<b>Dustin Robinson is a twenty-four month old boy. All men are attracted to him, but Dustin is ESPECIALLY loved by Daddies - the more Daddy-like a man is, the more infatuated with Dustin he is.</b><br />
<br />
Dustin set the pen aside and reviewed the wording of his wish. He shrugged and touched the parchment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words were barely out of Dustin&#39;s mouth when his world went white, the young man&#39;s cry of surprise ringing out all around as reality rippled through him. His vision returned just as quickly as it left, however, the utterly bizarre full-body vibrations disappearing as he blinked himself back into awareness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God.&quot; Dustin&#39;s heart fluttered at the squeaky sweetness of his babyish lisp, at the realization that his eyeline was at <i>least</i> three feet lower than it&#39;d been just a moment ago. It was the perfect perspective from which to first lay eyes on his dream nursery brought to life, all his boring grown-up furniture having transformed into a huge pile of stuffed animals, a fully-stocked changing table, and a hand-carved wooden crib. As thrilling as all that was, none of it could compare to what Dustin saw when he turned to the mirror - when he laid eyes on the cutest toddler he&#39;d ever seen in his life. He had a crown of shining golden curls, big bright blue eyes, puffy baby-smooth cheeks and a tiny button nose. His tummy was plump and wobbly, his arms and legs soft and pudgy, his fingers and toes tiny and stubby. Dustin turned and giggled his head off as he shook his round little rump at the polished glass, delighted by the way those chubby cheeks jiggled as he clumsily hopped up and down on his itty-bitty bare feet. <br />
<br />
Wonderful as all this was, the most thrilling element of his new form was to be found tucked between Dustin&#39;s meaty thighs as though ashamed of its tininess. The newly-minted toddler squealed in glee as he studied the small, wrinkled sack that clung tightly to his baby-smooth groin; as he stared in giddy, disbelieving glee at the rubbery little nub propped up on a pair of tiny marbles. Dustin felt as though he were dreaming as he explored his infantile equipment with his stumpy digits, whining and squirming as his miniscule peepee quickly stiffened to its full inch-and-a-half majesty. It was so, <i>so</i> hard and so, <i>SO</i> sensitive. The rounded knees of the whimpering two-year-old nearly buckled as wonderful tingles washed over the entirety of his three-foot, thirty-pound frame, the toddler gasping and shivering whenever the tips of his clumsy little fingers brushed against the rose-pink head of his throbbing pricklet. Unfortunately, Dustin&#39;s diminished coordination made it impossible to maintain a grip on his needy twig, the toddler stomping his widdle feetsies in frustration as he realized that all the tugging, rubbing and poking in the world wouldn&#39;t bring him to climax. He needed a Daddy!<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...well, hey there little guy!&quot; The huge man boomed, clearly surprised to discover that it had been a naked toddler knocking on his door. &quot;Are you all by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin said nothing - determined to convince Jake (his huge, hunky neighbor) that he was a genuine baby, he merely smiled around the thumb bobbing between his lips and gazed up curiously at the gigantic man, enjoying on a very deep level just how thoroughly the stud now towered over him. His free hand, meanwhile, toyed absently with the tiny stiffie that somehow grew even stiffer upon Jake&#39;s appearance, his suckled thumb muffling the little whines of pleasure that Dustin couldn&#39;t keep inside. Silencing himself become even more difficult when Dustin saw a strange look come over Jake&#39;s face - when he realized the man was drinking in every delicious detail of his beautiful babyish body. The bear of a man seemed particularly enamored by the rock-hard peepee that twitched just so with every beat of Dustin&#39;s racing heart, its rate jumping and his big bright eyes widening when he saw Jake&#39;s big thick grown-up cock strain against the fly of his jeans. Apparently the Veil had settled on a certain definition of &quot;attraction&quot; and &quot;infatuation,&quot; leaving Dustin beside himself with anticipation over what Jake might do to show his love for the bouncing baby boy. The first step was an encouraging one, as Jake took Dustin by the underarms and effortlessly swept him off his bite-size bare feet, the toddler&#39;s yip of surprise giving way to a bubbly stream of giggles as the chuckling man bounced the two-year-old&#39;s warm, chubby tushie on his strong, hairy forearm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell me your name, cutie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh! My name ith Dusty an&#39; I&#39;m two!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! You&#39;re such a big boy, knowing your name <i>and</i> that you&#39;re a whole two years old!&quot; Jake declared, heaping praise on the ecstatic toddler. &quot;I&#39;m Jake. I&#39;ll get you back to your Mommy and Daddy, okay? Then again, you&#39;re so sweet that I might just keep you for myself. Does that sound like fun, darling? Do you want me to be your new Daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH!&quot; Dustin cried as he clapped his fat little hands together. &quot;Wan&#39; Jakey Daddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tempt me, baby.&quot; Jake&#39;s smile faded somewhat as his eyes fell once more upon the toddler&#39;s adorable cocklet, staring at for a long moment before he shook his head and beamed at Dustin more brightly than ever. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get a diaper on that cute little butt of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>A <b>diaper!</b></i> Dustin&#39;s thumb returned to his lips, the overjoyed toddler sucking on it with increased fervor at the realization that the second part of his fantasy was about to come true. He felt as though he were drifting upon a cloud as Jake carried Dustin into his bedroom and laid him out on the covers, Dustin kicking and wriggling in utter elation when the massive man produced a diaper and a bottle of baby powder.<br />
<br />
&quot;My nephew&#39;s about your age.&quot; Jake mused as he swept up Dustin&#39;s ankles in one hand and lifted his tiny tush off the bedspread, the toddler gasping in delight when his chubby cheeks squished against the cushy interior of the Elmo-themed disposable slipped beneath them. &quot;This one might actually be a size too big, but we&#39;ll make do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s eyelids fluttered as his groin and bottom were engulfed by lilac-scented powder, the small coos that leaked out from around his thumb turning into sounds that were quite a bit less innocent, that spoke to the very adult pleasure the toddler was taking from Jake&#39;s slow, sensual massage of his warm, round, silky-smooth cheeks. The man&#39;s strong, massive hands lingered on Dustin&#39;s bottom well after it was totally powdered, Jake seemingly falling under a trance as he relished in the groans, moans, whimpers and whines of the toddler whose firm little ass he was fervently fondling. The waves of ecstasy wracking his tiny immature body were as pleasurable as they were torturous, Dustin wishing the moment would last forever but at the same time so desperate to get off that he thought he might cry if Jake didn&#39;t shift his focus to the two-year-old&#39;s trembling winkie. But while his hands grew tantalizingly close a couple of times, Jake seemingly couldn&#39;t bring himself to cross that final line, no matter how badly and obviously the toddler needed to get off. Would he give in to temptation and bring Dustin to the climax of his life? Or would he finish diapering the horny tot like the baby he is?</p>
