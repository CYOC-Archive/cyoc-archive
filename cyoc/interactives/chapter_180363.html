<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fidgeting about greatly to the point of a shiver Thomas dejectedly moved towards the bedroom door that she had run out of in a panic just moments earlier. With trepidation Thomas realized that she didn’t have the guts to walk the several blocks to Monica’s apartment or the same distance to Damon’s place and her only avenue of relief in figuring out why she was Monica was to go back up to the bedroom and explain things to the man within it that believed himself to be the real Thomas. Thomas didn’t know what she would find or how that other Thomas would react to her returning but she had no other choice at this point because getting that impostor on her side was better then going  into this journey alone.<br />
<br />
The door hadn’t moved from its closed position since she had closed it. Thomas looked down to the floor and found that there was no light glare streaming out from the other side meaning the lights were off. Finding this strange but determined to get inside nonetheless Thomas turned the knob and slowly crept the door forward as she crept her own heeled feet forward. The room was in fact dark, nearly pitch black to say the least and once she had opened the door up completely and stepped clear of the door she saw that not even the light from the hallway could completely penetrate the darkness. Unfortunately Thomas in her female form didn’t have much time to mutter over the possibilities of why this was so as at that very moment when her body had cleared the door she heard footsteps behind her and she didn’t even have time to react as the door that she had just step through slammed shut behind her.<br />
<br />
Yelping in fright at the noise Thomas leaped around ready to face her attacker but was taken off balance for a second time of the night as it felt like an unseen force simply and gently ripped all her clothes off at once including her bra and panties and caused her to drop down to the floor as the heels she was wearing simply disappeared into thin air. Suddenly the room was a bit cooler then usual and Thomas brought her arms up to her breasts in a hug and that’s when she realized that she was topless. Shrieking at this change in the darkness she felt the rest of her body including most alarmingly her groin and it all confirmed her greatest fears. Right at the moment that the full realization of what had happened to her became apparent and what it could mean Thomas felt a large and strong body come up from behind her and began kneading its hands all over the front of her body. Yelping at this assault on her person Thomas struggled to get away but the persons grip both in strength and increasingly sensual style kept Thomas where she was. “Hey baby I knew that acting from earlier was part of the kink, your back for more and already back in your birthday suit!” That voice whispering in her ear she knew who it was it was her own voice from her male body! Knowing that trying to explain the situation to him while he was rearing to go was hopeless Thomas knew that she would have to play along to prevent him from completing his desired intentions.<br />
<br />
Before she could even act on her plan though a terrifying new reality made itself apparent in her mind. Just as she began to utter a word the male Thomas began running his hands up her stomach and then proceeded to gently grab and rub her breasts. The first words didn’t even escape her lips as all worries and questions were muffled behind the wonderful feelings that began flooding the center of her universe. The female body that she now inhabited allowed her instincts to take over as orgasmic sexual sensations overrode all control. As the male Thomas nuzzled, kissed, and licked her neck  and shoulders his hands gently kneaded and rubbed her nipples in all the right places even taking the time to lightly flick each nipple. The fear and uncertainty she once had melted away and at no other place was this more apparent then on her face as the look of surprise and uncertainty gradually melted as her eyes closed her lips went limp and her facial muscles relaxed.<br />
<br />
Thomas in Monica’s body tried to resist but his male counterpart knew how to press every button. A glowing warmth spread throughout Thomas’s female body centered on her breasts and groin as she quickly let go of her original plan and decided to just go with the moment no matter what the consequences. A moan escaped her lips as her legs became increasingly weak to the sexual thrill. Thomas’s mind was lost to the feelings washing throughout her being, she didn’t even care anymore that she was Monica all she wanted at that moment was for the feelings to continue forever. The feeling of a bulge sticking into the small of her back didn’t even snap her back to reality. Suddenly her gradually weakening legs finally let go and she nearly fell to the floor below her if not for the male Thomas quickly scooping her up in his arms. In the darkness there was nothing to see but everything to feel as Thomas felt herself on the move being carried. Suddenly Thomas felt a pair of lips pressed to her own and still being the very horny woman that she was she allowed it do happen, even letting her tongue dance with the other.<br />
<br />
Placed gently on her  back on the familiar sheets she knew so well she knew what was coming. Part of her was still extremely fearful of what it meant but the sexual needs of this body overrode all doubt as she felt a large mass crawl on top of her. Hugging the body with her arms she waited for it as the kissing began anew in earnest. Biting her lip in between kisses and getting impatient as her body demanded the coming flood she suddenly screamed “will you just fuck me already!” Barely a second after that outburst her male voice from the darkness answered with a chuckle “Monica baby that’s all I was waiting for” Suddenly a hard pressure filled her groin painful at first but quickly became very pleasurable as the missing piece was filled in. Within seconds the new Monica was screaming in pleasure more pleasure then she had ever felt in her life and something she wanted more of immediately.</p>
