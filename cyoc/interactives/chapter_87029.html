<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie was the last one to wake up in the morning. All the age changes she had undergone over the last couple of days seemed to wear her out. Stretching she could see the other girls had already gone downstairs. Entering the hall and going downstairs Katie could see the five girls gathered in the living room watching t.v. <br />
<br />
The girls had all changed into nightgowns, which surprised Katie. Katie figured that when she adjusted the age of her room she must have also adjusted the age of her clothes. Now the girls had raided her closet and slipped into colorful nightgowns. The girls were all laughing and talking enjoying their breakfast. Katie smiled the group seemed to be enjoying their youth and seemed oblivious to the fact they were all senior citizens this time yesterday. Ignoring the group for now Katie made her way into the kitchen to see her mom.<br />
<br />
Kellie was dressed in a t-shirt and sleep pants cooking away at the stove. After the extreme  age changes she had gone through over the last couple of days the 43 year old seemed no worse for wear and actually seemed quite happy to be cooking. Turning towards Katie she smiled, &quot;Morning sweety your up late today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and took a seat at the kitchen table. &quot;Late night mom. How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at her daughter and smiled. &quot;I feel better than I have in years,&quot; she stated. &quot;I don&#39;t know what it is. I feel reborn...it&#39;s weird I can&#39;t put my finger on it.&quot; Kellie looked over at her daughter who had a puzzled look on her face. Kellie blushed and looked at the floor. &quot;Sorry hon,&quot; she said. &quot;Your mothers babbling I won&#39;t bore you.&quot; &quot;No that&#39;s okay mom,&quot; Katie stated. &quot;I follow you...I think.&quot; Katie looked at her mom and wondered, how much of yesterday did she remember. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;How much do you remember from yesterday?&quot; Kellie paused and looked at her daughter. &quot;Yesterday, why I picked you and your friends up from school and then we came home. Why?&quot; Katie sighed the ring had altered her moms memories to suit this reality. &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; Katie said. Kellie smiled and went back to cooking. &quot;I did have a weird dream last night though,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;I dreamed I was in my twenties again. Me and your friends went to the bar and the when I came home I started shrinking. The next thing I knew I was a little kid with you looking down at me. Before I could say anything I shrank some more and disappeared.&quot;  Katie stared wide eyed at her mom, somehow the ring had allowed her mother to retain some knowledge of the events yesterday. Katie gulped and answered. &quot;That&#39;s a crazy dream mom,&quot; she said. Kellie looked over at her daughter and smiled. &quot;Yeah I know,&quot; she said. &quot;That kind of thing is impossible. People becoming younger, going out with my own daughter and her friends. Probably should lay off the late night pizza.&quot; Katie and her mom laughed. &quot;Here&#39;s your breakfast sweety, go hang out with you friends and then get dressed. Rosalee will be her in about 90 minutes.&quot; Katie nodded and and headed towards the living room.<br />
<br />
As Katie took in her conversation with her mom she began to think. Her mom had somehow retained some memory of what had happened but believed it was a dream. Katie wondered if the others had retained some knowledge of what happened. Katie shook her head as the ring gave her an answer. Her mother had retained some knowledge of events because she had been unborn and then reborn with the ring. This allowed her to possess some knowledge of what happened. Befor Katie could ask another question the ring seemed to reassure her that her mother believed it was a dream and that Katie shouldn&#39;t worry. Relieved Katie approached her friends.<br />
<br />
The girls were happily talking amongst themselves. Katie smiled seeing them enjoying themselves so much but something in the back of her head told her that this wouldn&#39;t last. These women all had family, Katie knew that while it was fun having this many friends she had to let them make the choice on whether to stay kids. As she approached Mika smiled at her. &quot;Hey Katie,&quot; she said. &quot;Sorry I didn&#39;t wake you but looked tired you want some pancakes there really good.&quot; Katie smiled and took the pancakes Mika offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Could I talk to you all upstairs?&quot; The girls agreed and followed Katie up to her room. Once ther Mary Elise looked at her. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; She asked. &quot;You know you can tell us anything.&quot; The girls nodded in agreement. Katie sighed and wished for the girls to remember being 65 but not remember all the events of last night. Katie watched as the girls began to rub there eyes as they slowly began to remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh what happened,&quot; Mika said. &quot;Where are we....oh my god Mary! Claudia! Is that you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Claudia gaped at the small Asian girl in front of them before looking at eachother. Samantha and Tricia stared at the group before running to the mirror and looking at themselves. &quot;Oh..my..god.....look at us we&#39;re kids, I&#39;m so young...how did this this happen?&quot; Samantha exclaimed as she ran her hands over her body.  Tricia was in a similar state turning around in the mirror to get a look at herself. &quot;Look at me I&#39;m so thin,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I forgot how thin I used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary,&quot; Claudia squeaked. &quot;How did this happen, do you remember?&quot; Mary Elise closed her eyes as she tried to gather her thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; she stated. &quot;I remember us meeting up at the beach before we headed towards the bar. There was a girl and her older sister there. We started talking and then we were here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mar Elise opened her eyes and stared at Katie. &quot;You,&quot; she stated. &quot;You were at the beach. I was talking to a girl in her twenties. You were sitting right next to her. Did you do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded her head in response. &quot;Please don&#39;t be mad I just wanted to have some friends. At first I didn&#39;t think it would be so bad making you all kids again but then I realized you probably all have families. I&#39;m sorry if you want I&#39;ll change you all back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise paused and looked at Katie. &quot;This is all too much,&quot; she stated. &quot;I think I need to sit down.&quot; Mary Elise plopped down on the floor and began to rub her eyes. Claudia looked at Katie, while she was angry about what had happened, she was also amazed at the changes that had taken place. Cautiously she approached Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;I think I understand why you did this but were grown women. I have grandchildren your age....I mean my age, I guess. Maybe you should change us back.&quot; Katie shook her head. As she was about to make her wish Mary Elise stood up. &quot;Wait,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Claudia and Katie looked Mary Elise with a puzzled expression on there face. &quot;Claudia,&quot; Mary Elise stated. &quot;We should think about this . I mean look at us were kids again, we have our whole lives ahead of us. Besides we can stay young for a little while longer, maybe even get a little younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy,&quot; Tricia exclaimed. &quot;We have husbands, children, grandchildren even. I don&#39;t know if I want to be this young any longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary,&quot; Samantha said calmly. &quot;I know the idea of being young is fun but you can&#39;t be serious. What about our lives, our loved ones we can&#39;t stay kids forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t want to go back,&quot; Mary Elise pouted. &quot;You may have family out ther but I don&#39;t. My husband and I divorced years ago after our daughter died in a car accident. This could be a second chance for me and why do we have to go back now. We could stay young for another day or two. Our original plan was to spend to weekend together before we went home. Come on let&#39;s do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Mika looked at eachother and shrugged while Tricia vigorously shook her head no. Claudia sighed. &quot;Mary,&quot; she said. &quot;Please think about this. You can&#39;t seriously want to grow up all over again. I&#39;ll concede that spending the weekend as a kid could be fun but to stay like this I don&#39;t know. Besides puberty was brutal the first time, you want to deal with that again, and don&#39;t even get me started on becoming even younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise looked at Claudia with mournful eyes. &quot;We should vote,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ve always done thongs together we shouldn&#39;t stop now. What ever we decide we&#39;ll go with.&quot; Mary Elise turned to Katie. &quot;I know we&#39;ve just met Katie but we need your help can you help us decide.&quot; Katie paused and nodded her head, whatever the decision was she would honor it.</p>
