<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken grinned, adjusting himself so his new girlfriend could seat herself comfortably in his lap.<br />
<br />
Jeff had been a good friend, but he made an even better girlfriend. And what a tight, juicy pussy he ended up having! Ken pinched his girl’s nipple, making her squeal and squirm, and grinned. It was easy to find a friend, not so easy finding a perfect girl.<br />
<br />
But the feeling of satisfaction was momentary. <br />
<br />
Now that he had the perfect girl, Ken realized that there was a lot of other stuff that he wanted as well, like a dog. Then Ken thought about Ricky Martinez, who’d stolen quarterback from him earlier in the year.  Ken had been aiming to get back at him ever since, so why not kill two birds with one stone? The more Ken thought about it, the more he realized that it was time for Ricky to go to the dogs.<br />
<br />
“Say babe, you know Ricky?” Ken asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he took your Varsity spot, right?” Jess said, “He totally needs to go.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, Jess, I love how supportive you are,” Ken sniffed her hair, playing with a strand. <br />
<br />
“I love how decisive you are,” Jess replied, taking his hand and kissing it.<br />
<br />
Ken snuggled with Jess for a minute, thinking about how he wanted to deal with Rick. They could wait to meet up with him at school, but then, how would he sneak a puppy home? Plus, as far as he knew, the Chronivac had a range and wasn’t portable.<br />
<br />
“Jess, do you have Ricky’s number?”<br />
<br />
“I have everyone’s number,” Jess rolled her eyes, “Do you want me to call him?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, tell him whatever you need to get him over here. Is that guest bedroom across the hall still there?”<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Jess cocked a brow, “I mean, it hasn’t changed since yesterday, silly.”<br />
<br />
“Take him there,” Ken grinned.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you!” Jess wriggled her bum, then took out her phone and daintily dialed Ricky’s number, “Hello? Ricky? Yeah, hi, it’s Jess. Wanna come hang out? Who, Ken?” Jess winked at Ken, “Oh, he’s old news. Come on over.”<br />
<br />
Ken waited for Jess to hang up before chuckling, “He bought it, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Hook line and sinker, babe,” Jess winked.<br />
<br />
“You’re so good at this,” Ken smirked, nuzzling into the crook of her neck and kissing it.<br />
<br />
“Babe, I-I want you inside me again!” Jess gasped.<br />
<br />
“You’re insatiable,” Ken whispered in her ear, softly biting her lobe.<br />
<br />
Jess gasped, wriggling out of her jeans.<br />
<br />
His own fly was quickly undone, his fat cock throbbing.<br />
<br />
Jess lowered herself, engulfing Ken’s cock in her warm, moist folds. Ken gasped as he slid deep inside her velvety depths. Her pussy fit his cock perfectly.<br />
<br />
She bounced, fat tits wobbling. Ken sucked in a breath, feeling her insides squeeze and writhe around his thick shaft. Fuck she was so good, he’d barely gotten inside of her and he was already being brought close to climaxing.<br />
<br />
“Stop, sweetheart,” Ken gasped, “We gotta-ngh! Take a shower before that idiot arrives.”<br />
<br />
“Aw,” Jess pouted, but carefully stood up.<br />
<br />
Ken almost came on the spot, but held on as her pussy slid off of him.  Together, they walked to the bathroom across the hall. Her parents were still downstairs, her mom cooking and her dad watching TV. Thankfully, there was no one to notice the two of them as they walked into the bathroom and closed the door.<br />
<br />
They stripped.<br />
<br />
“My parents might catch us,” Jess whispered as she stripped, revealing her literally perfect body. <br />
<br />
Ken admired her lithe form as he stripped himself down. He’d really outdone himself! Ken admired his own form in the mirror, bouncing a thickly muscled pec. Jess walked over and kissed him on the cheek. She reached over and turned on the shower. Ken readied himself to step inside with her and realized his dick was bobbing stiffly.<br />
<br />
“Someone’s still horny.” Jess giggled, her soft fingers encircling Ken’s engorged cock.<br />
<br />
“Mmhmmm,” Ken said, allowing himself to be drawn into the shower with his new girlfriend.<br />
<br />
The sound of the water concealed their movements. Ken placed his hands on her stomach, then ran them up and under her breasts, giving them a slight pinch as he cupped them, all the while spreading the lather over her soft, dainty skin.. He rubbed soap on her fat pink nipples, feeling them stiffen under his tender ministrations. The fact that they used to be Jeff’s normal nipples had him harder than he’d ever been in his life.<br />
<br />
Ken found himself kneeling down as he washed Jess’s hot body. Soon he found himself in front of Jess’s tight folds. He reached out and rubbed the shaved mound, marveling at the complete lack of Jeff’s cock and balls. A little cum oozed from her lips and he gently washed it away, her pussy twitching as he did.<br />
<br />
“You like my pussy?” Jess breathed.<br />
<br />
Ken planted a kiss right one her nether-lips, tongue lapping at the folds. This had been his balls. He ran his tongue up to her clit, hearing her gasp and moan. And this… he flicked his tongue across her bean… had been Jeff’s cock. God, it was so hot, knowing he’d taken it all away from his former best friend!<br />
<br />
With a growl, he stuck his tongue deeper inside of her, looking up at Jeff’s feminized face which peered down at him over her supple breasts. She moaned, rubbing her perky tits, and Ken couldn’t help but wonder what having a pussy felt like. The way Jeff-err, Jess-was moaning like a whore, it had to feel really good. He dug his face deep into her snatch, licking and lapping, feeling her inner walls tense and twitch.<br />
<br />
Finally, he pulled back, gasping for air.<br />
<br />
“I love your pussy, Jeff.” Ken groaned, face covered in her lovely juices.<br />
<br />
“It’s Jess, baby,” Jess moaned as Ken stood back up, his fingers probing her pussy.<br />
<br />
Ken fingered her, holding her close, grabbing one of her tits and suckling on her hard nipple. Turning Jeff into a woman and listening to her whimper and moan, it was such a thrill to him. Ken was hard again and his cock found its way into her shower-slicked cunt.<br />
<br />
They clung to each other, lustful moans and groans filling the bathroom as he thrust. Jeff’s pussy was so perfect, the way it grabbed his cock and pulled it further into her. The way it milked him as he forced himself deep inside, his cock spearing his best friend’s vagina and churning it like butter.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t going to be able to hold on for long. Not with the way Jess was grinding into him, her silken moist walls clinging to his… oh fuck! Oh fuck, he was going to cum into his best friend!<br />
<br />
“Ah!” Ken cried, thrusting deep and hard, “Fuck, I love you Jess!”<br />
<br />
“I love you Ken!” Jess moaned, nibbling his earlobe.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Ken wheezed, his cock spasming into her wonderful depths. <br />
<br />
He came and came, her muscles contracting, inner walls pulling his cock and seed deeper. Ken’s balls ached as they churned and pulsed more and more jism inside her. Jess milked him dry and by the time his orgasm abated, Ken was a shuddering mess, grateful for the warmth of the shower sluicing the sweat from their lovemaking away as fast as it had formed.<br />
<br />
They kissed under the warm running water, Ken holding his lover tight. His cock was still inside of her, still hard, no thanks to the constant contractions her pussy was making. But he was spent and could only grunt softly as another meager load was forced out of his balls.<br />
<br />
“Jess!” Jess’s mom called from downstairs, voice muffled, “Your friend Ricky is here!”<br />
<br />
“Out in a minute, mom!” Jess shouted.<br />
<br />
Ken grinned at her and  they kissed one last time before she picked up the soap and they quickly scrubbed. A minute later, the shower was shut off and Ken handed Jess a towel.<br />
<br />
“I’ll stay in here. You lure him into the spare bedroom,” Ken whispered. <br />
<br />
“Okay, yeah. I’ll send you a text when it’s clear.” Jess whispered back as she dried her hair.<br />
<br />
“Right, then I’ll slip into your bedroom and activate the Chronivac. Keep him in there for at least five minutes so I can set things up.” Ken replied.<br />
<br />
“Got it. Wait here.” Jess gave him a peck on the cheek and walked out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Ken listened at the door, hearing her footsteps as she walked downstairs. He heard talking and laughing downstairs before two sets of feet walked back upstairs. <br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jess’s voice was slightly muffled but audible, “Let’s study in my spare bedroom.”<br />
<br />
“Not yours?” Came Rick’s much deeper voice from the hall outside.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s dirty. I don’t want you to see that.” Jess giggled.<br />
<br />
Ken just sat quietly and listened as Jess led Rick into the guest bedroom. A few moments later, a text came to his phone. The coast was clear. <br />
<br />
Ken slipped out of the bathroom and quietly snuck into Jess’ s bedroom. It was a little disorienting – as much as reality had changed for everyone else, Ken still remembered this as Jeff’s room and its now girly look was something he still didn’t expect.<br />
<br />
Ken took his place at the desk and pulled up Ricky’s profile. He hem’d and haw’d, wondering what kind of dog he wanted. German Shephards were pretty cool, plus  they were cute puppies. But while puppies were cute and easy to take care of, they eventually grew up.<br />
<br />
He paused.<br />
<br />
Well, then he’d just have to adjust the dog so it never grew up at all! Permanent puppy time for Ricky! But he’d also have to make sure no one thought it was weird that his puppy never got any older than a few months. And make some adjustments so the dog was potty trained. Ken got typing, furiously adjusting the program so that Ricky would be the perfect dog.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later… Ken wiped his brow and looked over his work.<br />
<br />
There, that should have done it! It had taken a lot of time trying to finagle the permanent age and reality adjustment. Ricky would live for a very, very long time as a puppy. And if Ken ever got bored of it… well, it was still an incredibly cute puppy, maybe Jess would like a new stuffed animal? Girls love those after all.<br />
<br />
With a grin and a flourish, Ken pressed enter.</p>
