<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the size and natural intelligence that Vipress had gained in addition to her great size and strength from the exposure to the chemical that she had found, the exact nature and composition of that chemical wasn't known to her. Being as intelligent as Einstein didn't make her omnipotent, and her &quot;slave&quot; Brendon wasn't even that smart. Brendon had found himself attracted to the snake that had invaded his room in a strange way, and he couldn't understand why, but he did, and it was why he had engaged the various acts he had done. Having sex with Vipress and bathing her in the chemical. Sometimes simultaneously.<br />
<br />
And it was here that their combined ignorance of the chemical that Rick had engineered began to come about, as not all of its effects were entirely noticeable. The chemical invaded all of Vipress' cells when she drank it or was spritzed by the bottle containing the chemical. It was what allowed her to grow and gain intelligence, but by bonding with all of her cells, the strange chemical was also finding its way into her venom glands and the &quot;juices&quot; inside her sexual organs. This progress was advancing to a point where she wouldn't need Brendon to spray her or give her the chemical. She could just contract the muscles around her venom glands and swallow the chemical that they manufactured. She didn't feel that change yet, and even if she did, the consequences on Brendon by their mating was about take her full attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistressss, I feel sstrange,&quot; Brendon said slowly as the two began to &quot;power down&quot; from their latest bought of mating.<br />
<br />
That caught Vipress' attention as Brendon had lisped the word mistress and strange a bit. She did, but that was because she was a snake and her tongue was still forked and had some difficulty in performing human vocalizations. But Brendon was human, he shouldn't have that problem. She lifted herself up and off of him and took a quick look at him and was surprised by what she saw. Brendon occasionally flicked out his tongue, and while it still looked largely human, it was starting fork, like her tongue was. His eyes had already changed to a bright gold color with a single slit pupil that ran the length Brendon's eyeball, and the skin around his eyes was restricting, as if he was losing his eyelids. Dark blue scales were beginning to appear on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are changing,&quot; Vipress said in a low and surprised voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am... but I didn't get any of the chemical... potion... whatever!&quot; Brendon protested.<br />
<br />
Vipress watched with her unblinking eyes as his changes continued. He cried out in pain as his head began to push forward and flatten, becoming more and more triangular in shape, just like her head was. More and more dark blue scales began to appear on his body and his hair was falling out. She couldn't fully understand it, she hadn't given any of the chemical to Brendon. She began to look things over on herself, just to make sure she hadn't smashed the bottle in one of her bouts of growth, it was then that she noticed her cloaca. Some of Brendon's semen was oozing out of it, but she also soon noticed a pink liquid oozing out of it Her own body was beginning to produce the serum and in their mating, she had exposed her slave to it, and given the size she had grown to in the course of being spritzed, drinking from the bottle, and receiving sexual stimulation as part of her growth, she'd given Brendon a massive dose of the chemical laced with her own DNA as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You abssssssorbed it from me,&quot; Vipress hissed, &quot;and I now pressssssent you with a great gift. The world will ultimately be mine... for even if the chemical isssssss now a part of me... I will ssssssoon be big enough to sssssssswallow humanssssss whole, forget ussssssing venom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you, misssstresssssss,&quot; Brendon answered honestly, his now forked tongue flicking in and out as he talked.<br />
<br />
Brendon was now nearly a complete snake. He had grown a tail, lined with the wide belly scales of any snake species and his arms and legs were withdrawing into him. They were getting smaller, and it was at this time that Vipress began to notice Brendon beginning to grow larger. She guessed he would soon be as big as her, and it was likely that if she bit him now, all she'd do was make him grow bigger. In addition another thought ran through the back of her mind. She needed him for a very different purpose now. For once she became the world's ruler, she would need heirs, and she would need Brendon for that now... and as a giant male viper, he would do well in that role.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessssss,&quot; Vipress nodded, &quot;good. But by abssssssorbing the chemical from me, you are becoming like me. That issssssss my gift. You will become my mate and we will rule together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mate, missssssstresssss?&quot; Brendon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesssssss,&quot; Vipress nodded, &quot;my mate. You have pleassssssed me greatly and desssssserve thissssss gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel ssssssssssstronger, missssssstresssss,&quot; Brendon spoke as his body began to grow more quickly. His arms and legs were gone, leaving him a complete snake and he was now preparing to catch up with Vipress.<br />
<br />
As his body began to grow in earnest, Brendon did feel stronger. He even felt a bit smarter, like his brain power was growing, despite the changes in his skull design. It felt good in a strange way, and he wondered if Vipress felt this way when she grew to her present size.<br />
<br />
&quot;That issssssssssss becausssssssssssssssse you are growing, growing to become my mate, if you will remain by my sssssssssssside,&quot; Vipress answered, taking the gamble that Brendon wouldn't know what she was beginning to realize. If he rejected her, she'd swallow as much of her own venom as a possible and grow large enough to swallow him whole.<br />
<br />
Brendon continued to feel himself growing larger. His serpentine body grew larger and stronger and was soon pushing heavily against Vipress' body as well. As he grew larger and stronger he felt better then he ever had before and far more powerful then he ever had before. He liked the feeling and a good part of his mind dwelt on getting revenge on Rick for treating him so poorly over the years. Not to mention that a good part of his mind felt that sex with Vipress had been great, and now that wouldn't be so deviant for him. She was a giant snake and now so was he.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of courssssssssssssse I will ssssssssssssstay with you, misssssssssssssstresssssssssssssss,&quot; Brendon hissed to Vipress as he finally reached her size and stopped growing, their massive bodies feeling somewhat cramped in Brendon's bedroom, &quot;where elsssssssssssssssse would I find a beautiful female to fill with my sssssssssssseed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendon slowly brought his head forward and began to nuzzle Vipress.<br />
<br />
&quot;And sssssssssoon we will be big enough to punissssssssssh all who might oppossssssssssse usssssssssssss or have wronged usssssssssssssssss,&quot; Brendon finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, my mate,&quot; Vipress answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Growing felt powerful,&quot; Brendon stated, &quot;where issssssss the bottle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vipress paused and looked around. She and Brendon wouldn't need the bottle anymore now. The chemical was being made naturally in their venom glands and so long as they drank some of their venom, they would either retain their present size or grow even larger. But, she couldn't let the bottle fall back into Rick's hands. Rick would soon discover the cause the conquest of the world that Vipress intended to launch with Brendon, and with that knowledge, he might find a way to counter her. The bottle would have to be finished off, and any other samples in the house destroyed or absorbed. Swallowing Rick whole wouldn't hurt either. After a few seconds she saw where the bottle was.<br />
<br />
It had been on a nightstand by Brendon's bead, but when Brendon grew from the small and weak human to the massive and powerful sixty foot male viper before her, his coils knocked the table over and smashed the bottle. Rick wouldn't get it. Which meant that now all they had to do was remove Rick from the equation.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bottle and the chemical isssssssss ssssssssssssssssmasssssssssssssshed,&quot; Vipress answered, &quot;but we don't need it any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't?&quot; Brendon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Vipress nodded, &quot;I will exxxxxxxxxxxxxxxplain, but not here. Thissssssssssssss bed isssssssssssss only barely ssssssssssssssssupporting our weight and the room will not contain ussssssssssss if we grow again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendon paused for a moment. Through his belly scales, he could &quot;feel&quot; the bed groan beneath him. The mattress, the frame, and everything was straining to support to sixty foot long vipers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sssssssssso, what do we do?&quot; Brendon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We go to where the chemical originated,&quot; Vipress answered, &quot;and wait for the weakling known as Rick... and while we wait, we will grow to the point where we can easily ssssssssssssssswallow him whole without injecting venom into him or having to sssssssssssssstruggle with him.&quot;</p>
