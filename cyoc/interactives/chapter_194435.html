<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty rapped on the doors, still feeling rather reluctant. But, reluctant or not, they were swiftly opened by a short Catfolk boy, who bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mornin&#39;, Miss Rhea. Miss Tyana?&quot; He looked questioningly at the new vixen. Ty nodded, still slightly flustered at being deferred to. She hadn&#39;t realised that being a slave would <i>elevate</i> her status like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Tommy,&quot; Rhea replied for her. As the young man ushered them into a brightly-lit waiting room, a low vulpine yowl echoed from deeper inside. Both Ty and Rhea caught their breath, the sound of Luma&#39;s release echoing in their memories and triggering their arousal. But Rhea recollected herself swiftly. &quot;We aren&#39;t late, are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Miss; Mistress Luma just got here early. She&#39;s been pleasurin&#39; herself with Annabelle the cleric -- sounds like she, ah, just finished.&quot; The vixens could sense the change in his bloodflow as he blushed beneath his fur. They weren&#39;t the only ones with erotic memories of that voice -- every slave, after all, had had at least one sexual encounter with the Mistress in the course of being broken in. Tommy&#39;s had been quite recent as he had just come of age after deciding he&#39;d have better prospects in the Palace than begging in the streets.<br />
<br />
They went on into the parlour proper. Ty&#39;s attention was immediately drawn to the tall, fire-furred figure of Luma, who had a buxom Minotaur girl pressed to the wall. Both were panting heavily, and there was an audible <i>pop</i> as the Kitsune pulled away. Seeing Mistress&#39; cock, still dripping with white fluid, Ty pressed her own legs together, a whimper slipping unwanted through her lips as she bit them.<br />
<br />
<i>So... so virile... Mistress... I wonder if I can get a few more kits from her...</i> Ty blushed as she caught herself, massaging her tits through the cloth as images of Mistress fucking her blurred with fantasy of nursing pups.<br />
<br />
She shook her head to clear it. How many did she want for her first litter!? Surely she had a few in her belly already, considering how many times Mistress had come in her. <I>Wait...</i> She was about to question why she assumed she was going to have a <i>litter</i>, but Luma&#39;s voice interrupted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, pets.&quot; Both concubines bowed deeply as Luma smiled at them. &quot;Rhea, come clean me up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mistress.&quot; Rhea moved over, kneeling down and inhaling of Luma&#39;s scent before beginning to lick the juices off Mistress&#39; balls and cock. The cow girl, meanwhile, readjusted her robes. Not that Ty noticed, fascinated at seeing the elder concubine who had dominated her submit to the Mistress in her turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... ah. And Tyana, meet Nazaire.&quot; The Mistress nodded to another figure in the room, and Ty wrenched her eyes away from the erotic display to see a compact hyaena woman. Her spotted hide was partially eclipsed by a full red silk bra and loincloth; thin white gloves covered her hands and forearms. A silver medallion dangled from her collar. &quot;She&#39;s the chief of the several piercing professionals I own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you, big sister,&quot; the Gnoll said, bowing. She herself had a single platinum earring in her right ear, and barbells were visible through her tight top. Ty offered the Gnoll an uncertain smile, trying to ignore Mistress and Rhea.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Pleased to meet you. I&#39;m Ty-Tyana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First piercing, eh?&quot; the hyaena asked. Ty nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never... thought about it before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don&#39;t worry, honey. Whatever you were before, you&#39;re a beautiful vixen now. May I?&quot; Ty gave a nod, and the Gnoll uncinched the cord and slid off the robe to reveal Ty&#39;s lush white and red-furred curves. &quot;Very beautiful, indeed. Gorgeous. It&#39;s always a joy to have vixens in -- and an honour to serve Mistress&#39; own bed slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-Thanks...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gnoll chuckled. &quot;Still getting used to it?&quot; Ty nodded. &quot;Aw, like I said honey, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ve got a wonderful life ahead of you, and there&#39;s no doubt you deserve it. Now if you&#39;ll come over here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty finally got a chance to take in the parlour. It had a rather homey feel, with wood panelling and portraits, presumably of freshly pierced slaves shyly or proudly presenting the fruit of the artists&#39; work on their flesh. But the scent of alcohol and soap, strong to her vulpine nostrils, told Ty that the room was thoroughly clean. Light was provided by lace-curtained windows to the outside.<br />
<br />
There was a desk and some cabinets, but Ty&#39;s attention now was on the trio of reclining chairs towards which she was being led and the tables between them. Specifically, the tray on one table holding an array of golden ornaments. She looked over them, thinking she recognised a pair of small gold rings with green gems as for her ears, but unsure about the rest.<br />
<br />
The Gnoll soon alleviated her curiosity, placing a finger by each item on the tray. &quot;Ears, belly, nipples, clit. Most painful last.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Clit?&quot; echoed Ty, tensing. &quot;Y-You... you can...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clitoral hood, honey.&quot; The Gnoll reached down, and gently pinched the skin. &quot;Not actually your clit... and it seems you have the build for the piercing Mistress wants. Good.&quot; She gave Ty a smile, then looked over. Luma and Rhea were now approaching, the concubine licking her lips. The bovine cleric hung behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall I explain the enchantments, Mistress, or do you wish to?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>So, they will be enchanted,</i> Ty confirmed mentally, trepidation cranking up, but admixed with anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, pet,&quot; responded Luma, catching the thought. Nazaire moved aside as the two Kitsune came to stand by Ty. &quot;The ear-rings; they will strengthen your connexion with me, and allow you to draw on my power to enhance your own magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic?&quot; Ty searched her memory. She hadn&#39;t thought about it, but she realised she did have access to some spells as a courtesan, as well as the ability to gain spell-like abilities as a Kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. And the clit ring will enable me and my children to control your genitals, and hence, your arousal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s mouth opened, but she couldn&#39;t say anything, her breath too thick at the thought. Her most intimate flesh pierced -- so that she would be... completely under another&#39;s power... Her mind, already full of the fog of her own arousal, nearly shut down from the feedback she was getting from Luma. Without realising it, her vulpine tongue lolled out. The Mistress chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, pet. Now sit down.&quot; Rhea helped Ty into one of the padded leather chairs as she tried to gather her wits and process what she was about to experience. Nazaire returned, accompanied by Tommy holding another tray of supplies. Luma nodded to the Minotaur in the background as the Gnoll took a cloth and wet it with antiseptic. &quot;And that is Annabelle, cleric of Freya, who will be healing your piercings.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cleric dipped her head. &quot;At your service, Miss.&quot; Ty nodded in return, still unable to talk, her eyes quickly going to the array of needles, clamps and tubes beneath Nazaire&#39;s fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be over quick,&quot; the Gnoll assured her. &quot;You might want to let Mistress or Miss Rhea take your hand... that&#39;s it... squeezing helps reduce the pain...&quot; As she murmured, she deftly swabbed at Ty&#39;s ear, cupping it so that it didn&#39;t twitch away, tail wagging slowly so close to their Mistress. For Luma now stood behind her, at Ty&#39;s right. Rhea stood at her left, and following the Gnoll&#39;s advice, Ty&#39;s fingers found the elder concubine&#39;s and interlaced with them.<br />
<br />
<i>-I heard that we had intruders.-</i> Rhea glanced at the Mistress as the hyaena marked the place of the piercing, thoughts flickering between them in silent conference.<br />
<br />
<i>-Yes. They came for Tyana and Stephanie... I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d be so quick.-<br />
<br />
-Oh my...-</i> Rhea lowered her gaze back to Ty, a soft intake of breath echoing as the needle pierced the delicate tissue of her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a pinch,&quot; murmured Nazaire.<br />
<br />
Then the hyaena moved around the chair, Rhea stepping back as Luma took Ty&#39;s other hand. Ty looked up at her Mistress, a smile coming to her muzzle as she squirmed in arousal and sheer joy under the hot mix of lust and approval in Luma&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold still, honey,&quot; Nazaire admonished softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>-May I ask what you did with them, Mistress?-</i> resumed Rhea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Luma continued to look into Ty&#39;s eyes, but she responded to Rhea&#39;s query. <i>-There were four. Two I personally caught and turned to werewolves for milking and breeding. The other two are down in the dungeons. They refused clemency, so I prepared something special for them.-</i><br />
<br />
She paused. The second ear-ring was sliding into place, a whisper from Annabelle and a small flare of divine magic sealing the process. Luma had to adjust as the enchantment took hold and the channel between her mind and Ty&#39;s grew wider and deeper. This conversation was not one she wanted the new concubine to share in.<br />
<br />
For her part, Ty felt the stronger connexion as increased warmth. Greater assurance that she <i>belonged</i> to Luma, feeling the dominant Kitsune&#39;s possessive love and desire for her flood into her mind. She had a vague sense that Luma and Rhea were talking, and that it involved her; but she was too flush with arousal to really care -- and she trusted them.<br />
<br />
That trust tempered her fear as Nazaire leaned the chair back, converting it into a flat cot. &quot;Perfect,&quot; the hyaena murmured as she examined her belly-button. &quot;Relax, honey, this one won&#39;t hurt either...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>-Under the circumstances,-</i> continued Luma, glancing at her senior concubine as Nazaire cleaned Ty&#39;s stomach, <i>-I decided Ty should be the one to transform them. I spent my morning preparing a spell scroll for her, in addition to preparing the jewellery with Nazaire.-<br />
<br />
-Is that wise, Mistress? Little Tyana is barely adjusted to her own role; she might view reducing her comrades to slaves -- less than slaves -- as a betrayal.-</i><br />
<br />
Rhea squeezed Ty&#39;s hand as once more the vixen&#39;s breath caught when the needle slipped through her flesh.<br />
<br />
<i>-That was why I selected the enchantments I did for the piercings,-</i> explained Luma. Not every slave could question her decisions, but Rhea was chief concubine for a reason. All of the concubines were close to the Mistress not just carnally but emotionally, and Rhea was her dearest confidante and adviser, deeper in her counsels than many even of her children (who were the only ones, apart from her slaves, that Luma trusted).<br />
<br />
<i>-They should ensure she sees the punishment as fitting, and enjoys fulfilling my command.-</i><br />
<br />
Rhea nodded thoughtfully. <i>-I was wondering why you lavished such spells on a neophyte. With your presence to guide her, she should understand.-</i><br />
<br />
Luma laughed silently. <i>-Ty is something special. She is well worth the effort.-</i><br />
<br />
Nazaire was now swabbing Ty&#39;s nipples. The &quot;neophyte&quot; was fighting to control her breathing, once again drawing on her training to deal with difficult situations to remain calm. The mere physical presence of the piercings -- the weight of the gold and emeralds tugging at her ears -- already signalled to her recently male mind that she now existed for beauty, to show herself off for and give herself to others, her Mistress first and foremost.<br />
<br />
It was a good thing, as Nazaire explained, that the solution she used dulled sensation as well as sterilised the piercing areas. Although the Gnoll&#39;s touch was quick and professional, Ty&#39;s nipples were now fully erect with her arousal at her utter helplessness: flat on her back with the other females standing over her, Mistress&#39; mind pressing even stronger on her own; Nazaire sealing her feminity.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid this will hurt a bit, honey,&quot; Nazaire warned. <br />
<br />
But even the pain increased Ty&#39;s arousal, the sharp sensation in her tits driving home to her that she <i>had</i> tits. Round and heavy on her chest. That she <i>was</i> a female, and a slave, being pierced at another&#39;s will. She squeezed Rhea&#39;s hand, moaning.  The memory of their tear-filled conversation came back to her as she blinked up at the gently reassuring expression of her senior. How Rhea had made feel, beautiful and loved and proud of her new destiny.<br />
<br />
Then she looked back to Luma. She was a beloved slave. A -- <i>gasp</i> -- beautiful pet, soft flesh tingling as it was enhanced beneath Mistress&#39; gaze, <i>for</i> Mistress&#39; gaze. She shivered as the cold metal glided through her flesh, settled on her bare areola.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, hold still,&quot; Nazaire reminded her with a bit of a laugh. &quot;I know you&#39;re excited honey, but you don&#39;t want to make me miss. &#39;Specially on this last one...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right...&quot; Ty lifted her head, trying to crane her neck to see as she felt the Gnoll&#39;s gloved fingers, armed with a cotton swab, probe her clitoral hood more thoroughly. Her legs clenched, and she willed herself to relax. Ty couldn&#39;t make out much past her cleavage, but she did admire the barbells now flanking her nipples with beads of gold. She resisted the urge to touch one as Annabelle&#39;s soothing magic healed the little wounds. She drew in a deep breath, and let her head rest back on the cot. And breathed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And breath in...&quot; And in again at Nazaire&#39;s words. Then Ty&#39;s claws dug into Rhea&#39;s fur, a whimper escaping her as the needle pierced behind the shaft of her clitoris. A few seconds later the jewellery slid through, and the pain mixed with pleasure as the bar pressed against the bundle of nerves from within, and a gemstone rested lightly atop her outer clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;...And out. And done.&quot; Nazaire dabbed at her crotch some more as the healing warmth of Annabelle&#39;s prayer banished the pain. Then the hyaena stood up and smiled down at Ty. &quot;Good job, big sister. You did wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;m very proud of you, pet.&quot; Luma trailed a hand across Ty&#39;s fur, the skin shuddering at the light touch. &quot;Now, see how you look.&quot; Even the Mistress sounded eager as Rhea helped Ty to her feet. As she had earlier, the elder concubine led the neophyte in front of a mirror, then stepped back, leaving Ty to run her hands over herself, gingerly touching the metal embedded in her and finding that it did not hurt, but tugged at her flesh, a tantalising reminder of what she was in sex and station.<br />
<br />
Offsetting the green stones hanging from her ears, a large red ruby now nestled in her belly, while a smaller one capped her genitals as she had felt. She rubbed her hand-pads over the taut expanse of her stomach, feeling the contours of the jewel in her navel.<br />
<br />
<i>Now I really feel like a harem dancer.</i> A smile tugged at her muzzle -- and suddenly Ty found herself blinking away tears. She felt so beautiful, so female, so... indescribably alluring with that final thought of her hips swaying and bust bouncing, that large gem winking in her midriff under the light of imaginary stage. For the first time in her life, she was crying with joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-Thank you, Mistress... and you t-too... Nazaire... Annabelle...&quot; She rubbed at her eyes, trying to clear them so she could continue to admire herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a pleasure, Miss,&quot; the Gnoll assured her. &quot;Now one final word -- with Annie&#39;s magic having taken care of the healing, you won&#39;t need a lot of aftercare. But you shouldn&#39;t remove the jewellery until after your bath sets the flesh around it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I won&#39;t,&quot; Ty said fervently. She giggled softly as the fears of the morning came back to her. How foolish she had been! She had recovered the memories of her past; she could see them even now in her mind&#39;s eyes. Like grey marble tombs -- lovely, and dead.<br />
<br />
<i>Now</i> she was alive, awash in warmth and colour, filled with hot throbbing blood and sweet lust. And not just lust for sex, which she had already experienced to the full in the throne room when she first submitted -- this embraced that and went beyond. This was exultation in the fullness of her being. She tossed her head, letting her attention be drawn to the ear-rings and the pride of Luma that she felt entwining with her own.<br />
<br />
Take them out? Not unless she had to! She <i>belonged</i> to Mistress Luma, and Mistress belonged in her. She was owned, and she owned it. She felt like she was swimming in the air, almost dancing already on clouds of bliss. The contrast of the hard metal and gems against her soft fur delighted her as much as the flashes of light off of them. She felt no rancour towards her old self -- she had done well to help her friends -- but she felt no regret any more either.<br />
<br />
<i>This</i> was what she wanted! Now, and forever! Being a vixen and pleasure slave wasn&#39;t just what she was born to be -- it truly <i>was</i> heaven as Rhea had said!<br />
<br />
&quot;It is safe for her to have sex?&quot; inquired Luma, tails waving in satisfaction. Nazaire raised an eyebrow -- not surprised that Luma might wish to celebrate with her concubine right away, but rather that she needed to ask. But, she realised, this was probably for Ty&#39;s benefit. Though Ty, lost in her epiphany, scarcely registered the exchange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mistress. As long as you aren&#39;t super rough, the magic should have progressed the healing well past the point where it&#39;s safe to play with the piercings and get them wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Luma took the green robe from Rhea and strode to Ty. Despite not being through with the mirror and her fantasies of dancing for a horny audience, Ty docilely let her Mistress clothe her again. Then Luma took her hand. &quot;Come, pet. I have one more gift for you before you take that bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Ty cocked her head. Luma smiled enigmatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;A surprise gift. Rhea, you may go about your other business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mistress.&quot; The elder concubine bowed. Coming near, she ran her hand over Ty&#39;s silky hair. &quot;Congratulations, little sister. You did very well. Now be a good girl for Mistress Luma, and enjoy what she has for you. Remember -- she chose you, so you deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She and Luma kissed, then the Mistress gave her motherly rear a swat. Rhea laughed, gave Ty a quick lick as well, and then departed, her three tails adding to the sway of her hips. Ty watched her exit into the waiting room, touching her cheek where her elder had licked her. It still seemed slightly odd -- she had not been a fox long, after all -- but she was more wondering about this strange &quot;gift&quot; the other two Kitsune had mentioned.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
But she did not have to wait long for it. Luma led her quickly from the piercing parlour, through the indoor atrium, and to another teleporter room. From there they emerged into a place of brown walls and aromatic braziers. Ty&#39;s arousal immediately spiked from the heavy atmosphere of aphrodisiac incense. It was not until they entered the hallway however and began walking past barred cell fronts that she realised -- these were the dungeons she&#39;d heard about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s curiosity grew. She glanced at the cells as they passed, but all seemed empty; Luma usually &quot;processed&quot; such guests quickly. So Ty was spared any sorrowful sights. Until, that is, they reached a cell holding two men, chained to the far wall, their limbs stretched into an &quot;X&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are... As promised.&quot; Luma seemed to be talking to the men as much as to Ty, her eyes glinting.<br />
<br />
Ty frowned as Luma bade the cell door open. The men looked familiar. They...<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, pet.&quot; Ty was drawn into the cell by Mistress&#39; tails, guided to stand in the centre of the chamber, facing the two captives. They stared back at her, trying to figure out who she was. But while her changed form baffled them, it did not take Ty long to recognise the naked forms of those she&#39;d once rescued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Titus!&quot; she cried. &quot;K-Klyde! What --&quot; She cut off, remembering the guard&#39;s words about intruders. A bolt of ice stabbed through her sexual euphoria and the all-pervading comfort of Luma&#39;s presence. Softly, already knowing the answer, she finished, &quot;What are you doing here...&quot;</p>
