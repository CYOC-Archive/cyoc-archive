<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny blushed as she followed Holli through the doorway and into the house, looking around at the weird décor. It reminded Jenny of a barn more than a house, with no sign of any modern features at all, everything was made of wood and looked medieval yet homely, like a fairy-tale cottage… and yet she couldn’t see a single hint of fabric. Clearly this realities lack of clothes extended to all cloth.<br />
<br />
She nervously followed her naked host, her own nude body blushing pink as her bare feet padded across the wooden floor, noting it was strewn with a straw like material to keep it ‘soft’. Jenny rounded a corner looking down at her feet before she gasped and looked up in shock when she heard other voices.<br />
<br />
“Holli… and, who’s this?”<br />
<br />
Jenny blinked and stared, lounging in the room were a group of six stunningly beautiful women, all naked. Each looked about Holli’s age though some looked marginally younger or older and while each had very distinctly different features Jenny could tell they were all related to Holli.<br />
<br />
“Jenny, this is my family… my mother, aunt, grandmother and sisters…”<br />
<br />
Jenny stared at Holli in surprise; one of these women was a grandmother?! Jenny looked around awkwardly, to her it seemed completely impossible, none of the women in the room looked older than 25! It took her a moment to mentally work out who was who and eventually decided the bright blonde in the corner looked the oldest, while the 2 brunettes and smaller blonde curled up together on the floor were definitely Hollis sisters. So, Jenny reasoned, it was clear that these women didn&#39;t age like she was used to from her own reality, and it was also clear to her that, with the lack of men, these women had formed family units completely foreign to anything she was used to either.<br />
<br />
“Its um, It’s a pleasure to meet all of you” Jenny said quietly then gasped when all of the women spread their legs to her, presenting their pussies in a sexual display that made Jenny squirm awkwardly. Holli took her hand and whispered in her ear nervously, “Show them your pussy… its polite here…”<br />
<br />
Jenny blushed and awkwardly complied, opening her legs as wide as she could which seemed to appease the other women who closed their legs lazily.<br />
<br />
“She’s a wet, like you Holli” one of the girls on the floor said which prompted lots of giggling from the younger girls.<br />
<br />
“Yes Jenny is” Holli said defensively, holding Jenny close to her hip which made the nude cheerleader bite her lip in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“I haven’t seen you before…” Holli’s grandmother said leadingly.<br />
<br />
“Oh I um… I’m, um, foreign…”<br />
<br />
With that everyone in the room froze, staring at Jenny in a mixture of curiosity, surprise and awe. She could only stand awkwardly as the nude women appraised her, her eyes glancing around nervously as her skin blushed; she was relieved when Holli took her hand and held it supportively.<br />
<br />
“You’re from across the sea?” one of Holli’s sisters broke the silence with an excited question, which seemed to break the tension and Holli laughed and turned to give Jenny a nod.<br />
<br />
“Yep, I’m from over the sea” Jenny said, catching the way Holli’s mother and grandmother were looking at her sceptically.<br />
<br />
“What’s it like?” one of the other girls said with an excited smile, her eyes sparkling in wonderment which made Jenny laugh.<br />
<br />
“Its… there’s more guys” She said and then blushed when she saw the confusion on the girls faces.<br />
<br />
“What’s a guy?”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s eyes widened when she realised in this world, reality… wherever she was, they only seemed to know those creatures in the fields as ‘males’ and they definitely didn’t have any concept of what she meant by ‘guys’.<br />
<br />
“I uh… guys are like… um…” Jenny stumbled, “they’re like little furry creatures… like squirrels…”<br />
<br />
“Aww, they sound cute…” One of Holli’s sisters said brightly which caused Jenny to laugh again.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, some of them are…” She paused when she felt Holli squeezing her hand a little tighter. “Um, you have a lovely home…” Jenny ventured to Holli’s mother, the woman smiled warmly in response while Jenny suddenly remember how surreal the whole situation was. Here she was, completely naked, in a room filled with other beautiful and equally naked women, making small talk about the strangely medieval living conditions.<br />
<br />
“Thank you … Jenny… it’s so wonderful for Holliana to bring home a mate”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s eyes bulged in embarrassment but she her tongue, and was surprised when she caught Holli blushing too.<br />
<br />
“I um… we’ll be in my nest…” Holli squeaked and before Jen could process what was happening she found herself being dragged by the hand through the small room and up a flight of uneven wooden stairs into the upper part of the house. Jen gasped when she looked around, realising the entire top half of the house seemed completely open right up to the roof, like a barn. All around and above were a series of balconies, fenced off ledges at various heights, each connected to those around it via a seemingly chaotic series of wooden steps.<br />
<br />
“…your nest?” Jen whispered confused as Holli lead her by the hand along a narrower bit of one floor before leading up another set of smaller stairs and then onto one of the fenced ledges.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh, my nest… so we can talk about where you’re from in private” Holli whispered back.<br />
<br />
“No… I mean, you have a nest?” Jen asked more urgently before she saw what Holli was leading her towards. She hadn’t considered it until then but in a reality seemingly without fabric of any kind it made sense that they wouldn’t have beds like she was used to. But it still surprised her to see what looked like a sort of bird’s nest, large enough for a person, made from what looked like soft moss and luscious grass. Its sides were high and almost domed over, creating what was almost a ball of the soft material with a small opening on one side to climb in.<br />
<br />
She followed Holli inside and gasped when her bare feet came into contact with the mossy looking material. It felt like the softest fur and the most luscious satin at the same time and she had to avoid swooning at how incredibly soft, warm and comforting it felt.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow… it’s like a dream…” Jen said to herself as she stooped low enough to climb inside and join Holli. It was cramped but comfortable, and Jen blushed as she found the best position for both of their comfort found them laying on their sides, face to face, their bare breasts lightly touching while their legs entwined.<br />
<br />
“Ok, now you can tell me,” Holli started, her eyes sparkling, “and tell me everything”</p>
