<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the course of the week, Jillian began adapting to her roll as big sister. It took some getting used to, if she were honest. Alex, despite beinga sweet kid, was only five. Five year olds as Jillian discovered needed alot of assistance.<br />
<br />
Jillian was getting slightly annoyed by the fact Alex needed so much help. The boy couldn&#39;t make his own food, he still needed an occasional assist in shoe tying, and asked more questions than the teen thought humanely possible. It made getting her work done a bit harder but, everytime she thought she would lose it Alex would do something adorable. An adorable thank you punctuated by a hug from the boy would quickly melt her heart. &quot;Wonder if this happens with Jeff,&quot; Jillian pondered.<br />
<br />
By Friday, Jillian was beginning to settle into the idea of being an older sibling. Alex may not have been great for conversation but he certainly adored his big sister. She appreciated the small things he did, even if it made a mess like how he tried to bring her a soda while she was doing homework. Watching the poor kids lip tremble after he accidentally dropped a two liter soda washed away Jillian anger. She hugged him, told him it was okay, and proceeded to help him clean. She was learning to be patient and her patience was rewarded.<br />
<br />
Alex and Artie were going on a play date Saturday. Since Jeff and Jillian&#39;s parents were busy, the teens decided to go to Jeffs house. Finally Jillian would get a chance to see Jeff. As the siblings now pulled into Jeffs driveway, Alex raced for the front door excitedly ringing the doorbell several times.  &quot;You only have to ring it once Alex,&quot; she called. &quot;We&#39;re not trying to look like psychos here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kay,&quot; Alex called back in his adorable voice. Jillian could only sigh, a small smile spreading across her face. The kid was cute but he could certainly be a doors sometimes. As Jillian now approached, she could see Jeff answer, offering a polite smile as Alex now raced indoors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jillian,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Good to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian felt her cheeks flush as she nervously pushed her hair behind her ears. &quot;Good to see you too,&quot; she smiled. Jillian now paused as she looked over Jeffs house, it seemed alot quieter than usual. &quot;Where&#39;s everybody? Was expecting an army of kids to be running around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only on the weekdays,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;And since Tommy slept over at Ryan&#39;s last night its just me and Arite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian heart now raced, this was about as alone as she would get with Jeff. As she now approached, she noticed Jeff give her an odd look. Slowly he now closed the door as he approached her. &quot;So,&quot; he asked. &quot;You and Alex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um yeah,&quot; Jillian replied, obviously confused. &quot;What about my brother?&quot; Jeff now gave her a coy look, slowly removing his phone as he motioned her to come forward. As Jillian approached, Jeff now pointed down to his phone. Jillians eyes going wide as she noticed the Chronovac app. &quot;How long have you had the Chronovac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about,&quot; Jillian asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jillian,&quot; Jeff sighed. The teen now glanced around, lowering his voice as he now spoke in a hushed tone. &quot;Look,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I&#39;ve had this thing for awhile now. I can&#39;t explain it but, if something changes I remember what things were beforehand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay well now you just sound crazy,&quot; Jillian stated, trying to play off Jeffs accusations. Jeff simply raised an eyebrow, his answer taking Jillian completely by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Really then how come I remember you being an only child,&quot; he said. &quot;Last time you were over you didn&#39;t have a little brother. Did your parents just adopt him this week or is their something your not telling me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian balked, unsure how to answer. How could Jeff know? Had Jeff used the Chronovac before? &quot;Okay hold on,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;How would you know about the Chronovac? In fact, how would you know about any changes I&#39;ve made, if I made any changes. Also, have you made any changes to anybody?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff fidgeted, he hadn&#39;t expected Jillian to counter back at him. Composing himself he now looked to the rather cute teen as he tried to answer. &quot;Okay look,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe I have but I know you did too. So, can we both agree that maybe we&#39;ve changed somethings useing the Chronovac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian paused, biting her lip before nodding. Neither teen now said anything, yet it felt as if a weight was lifted from their shoulders. &quot;I thought I was the only one,&quot; Jillian whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;I&#39;ve been keeping it a secret. I didn&#39;t know how people would react.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; Jillian sighed. &quot;So, how many people have you transformed?&quot; Jeff raised an eyebrow, casting her a grumpy look. &quot;Hey you started this,&quot; she exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I&#39;ll admit to one if you confirm Alex,&quot; Jeff stated. &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve both tried this numerous times am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian simply nodded, she had tried it more than once but would like to keep that bit of information to herself. &quot;Okay deal,&quot; Jillian stated. &quot;And yeah, I tried it on more than just Alex. Now you want to tell me one of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Fuentes husband,&quot; Jeff stated. <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Mrs. Fuentes-Katral,&quot; Jillian countered. &quot;Theyve been married for awhile now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not always,&quot; Jeff replied rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;Ms. Fuentes was um a single mom. I uh kinda gave her a husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Jillian gasped to which Jeff blushed. Jillian now paused, a feeling of guilt washing over her. Jeff had actually helped someone with the Chronovac while she had simply aged some guy down into a little brother so she could see him. &quot;Okay well now I feel like an asshole about Alex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you&#39;re not an asshole,&quot; Jeff stated, trying to make Jillian feel better. &quot;Look, I bet Alex is way happier as your little brother. Is Alex happy? Are you happy? Are you making his life better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian paused, going through old memories of Alex before he became her little brother. As an old man he was miserable being alone. Now the two of them found their new dynamic so fulfilling. &quot;Yeah he does seem happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think thats the only rule with this thing,&quot; Jeff stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait this thing has rules,&quot; she asked. Jeff simply shrugged, not really but that seemed like a general rule they should follow if they were going to use the Chronovac. An awkward pause now hung between the teens.  Jillian had simply been trying to work up the nerve to ask Jeff out. Now it appeared that the two had far more in common than they thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Jeff asked. &quot;Since we both have a Chronovac I think we should work together. You know, as a couple.&quot; Both teens faces turned crimson, underneath that in the oddest way possible Jeff had asked Jillian if she wanted to go out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um yeah I like that,&quot; Jillian replied shyly. &quot;I um was going to ask you the um same thing. Sort of.&quot; Jeff grinned, slowly taking Jillians hand as the pair now made their way inside.</p>
