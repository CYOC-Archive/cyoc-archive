<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann sighed as she gazed out the front window of the hotel. It wasnt easy being the girlfriend of a teenage wizard. Now she found herself waiting with two teenagers from an alternate timeline, her future niece in law, a pair of demons, and an animatronic fury. &quot;Easily the weirdest wedding I&#39;ve ever been to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning towards the hotel bar, Ann realized she could really use a drink. Not entirely surprising it appeared some others needed a drink as well.<br />
<br />
Cole Harris waved to Ann as he now joined the business woman by the front of the bar. &quot;Couldnt sleep either huh,&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
Ann could only shake her head now as she gazed up at the towering former Marine. &quot;That obvious,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;Surprised you&#39;re not sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Kumi and the others turned in early,&quot; he said stretching. &quot;But it always takes a minute for me. Kind of a night owl. That and well the attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann could only nod, frowning as recalled the chaos of an hour ago. Ann&#39;s time displaced pregnant sister had given birth, only to have the child kidnapped. Katie and the others immediately sprang into action, leaving a small group behind just in case. That group had gone to great lengths now to make sure nothing happened, placing protective charms around the hotel while casting a sleeping spell on most of the guests. It seemed that only Ann and Cole now were the only ones without magic to remain unaffected.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how come your still awake,&quot; Cole asked. &quot;Shouldnt the spell have knocked you out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked to stay up,&quot; Ann shrugged. &quot;Thankfully they agreed with me. What about you?&quot; Cole grinned impishly, lifting his shirt to show Ann the Desert Eagle revolver concealed beneath. &quot;Our nieces may know magic but they dont know anything about protecting the perimeter. Besides Yuriko owes me after the stunt she pulled to come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann glanced over at the sullen looking teen in the front foyer. Since learning of his time traveling daughter, Cole and Kumiko had brought the girl to live with them. Unfortunately for Yuriko it also meant once more being at the mercy of her parents rules, specifically being grounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Cole turned to stare at Vixi the animatronic fury. Vixi smiled her perfect robotic smile, a smile the two adults found to be a mix of pleasant and unnerving. &quot;Hi,&quot; Ann said slowly. &quot;Umm how are things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly wonderful,&quot; Vixi said happily. &quot;My goddess has asked that I provide any assistance while she is away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what assistance would that be,&quot; Cole asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vixi&#39;s body was forged by Hephaestus and enchanted by Lilith, Baba, and Circe,&quot; Ayami the succubus said. &quot;She has a few tricks up her sleeve.&quot; Cole could only nod as they curiously gazed at Ayami and her imp companion. Ayami had chosen her succubus form, her wings neatly folded right now as a pair of small horns protruded from her head. Despite her demonic appearance, Cole couldnt help but feel somewhat attracted to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to tone it down Ayami,&quot; Rexoie sighed as she floated in the air. &quot;Rambo here is going gaga over you.&quot; Ayami grunted in frustration, her wings and horns vanishing leaving her a voluptuous looking teenager. Rexie thanked her companion, the imp once more tearing a chunk of meat from the turkey leg in her leathery hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you think of food at a time like this,&quot; Ayami scoffed. Rexie simply shrugged, tearing off another piece of meat in her needle like teeth.<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she now rounded the corner. While not thrilled to be left behind she understood. Morgan needed someone to protect her. After casting several spells and making sure Morgan was sleeping soundly she now began her patrol along with Jen and Ashley. Seeing Ann, Cole, and the demons she quickly made her way towards the group. &quot;Hey guys,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Anyone seen anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Cole said. &quot;Perimeter is secure.  Was actually thinking of grabbing a drink.&quot; Kellie smiled, a drink definitely seemed like a good idea.<br />
<br />
 *WARNING: PERIMETER BREECH: MULTIPLE MAGICAL SUBJECTS DETECTED*<br />
<br />
Cole and the others turned to stare at Vixi. The animatronics face appeared frozen, its eyes flashing a light blue as a synthetic voice now echoed throughout the lobby. &quot;Location,&quot; Cole said quickly, upholstering his gun.<br />
<br />
*UNABLE TO VERIFY* Vixi responded in the same monotone voice. Cole swore under his breath, his training as a Marine recon leader now kicking into gear. &quot;Search the perimeter,&quot; he ordered. &quot;Kellie go with Ashley and Jen, search the Westside of the hotel. If you make contact with any hostiles report it immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded turning to her friends before heading towards where Cole was pointing. &quot;You two,&quot; Cole said quickly, pointing at Ayami and Rexie. &quot;Search the East. Link up with the other two, what&#39;s their names? Karen and Sebastian? Search the East. Report any contact but do not engage until backup arrives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who made you the boss,&quot; Rexie grumbled as she glared at Cole. Cole grabbed the imp bringing her within inches of his face as he glared at her. &quot;We dont have time for this,&quot; he growled. &quot;Unless you&#39;ve had experience dealing with insurgents than shut up and follow orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rexie was stunned but complied, quickly flying off with Ayami in pursuit. &quot;What about me,&quot; Vixi asked in an almost melodic tone. &quot;You&#39;re coming with me and Ann,&quot; he ordered. &quot;I&#39;m going to need your help not only communicating with the others but searching the second floor. We need to find that breach.&quot; Vixi nodded, following behind Cole as Ann trailed behind.<br />
<br />
To say their investigation was unnerving would be an understatement. Ann shuddered as they searched the dimly lit corridors of the second floor. With everyone currently under the affects of a sleep spell the silence only added to her anxiety. Despite wanting to ask Cole where they were going, she dare not break the silence.<br />
<br />
It didnt take long before Cole came to a stop, ducking down as he began to motion towards the far end of a corridor. Ann strained her eyes as she looked at what Cole was pointing before gasping in fear. &quot;What is that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole shushed Ann as they watched the thing at the end of the corridor. The creature was grey in color and massively muscled despite its average height. Cole watched as the creature seemed to scan the corridors with pupil less red eyes. &quot;Vixi what can you tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unknown magical creature detected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole sighed. &quot;Can I kill it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unknown.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole sighed, rubbing his beard as he weighed his options. &quot;Fuck it!&quot; Leveling his pistol Cole now fired several well placed shots at the creature. Ann had never been around firearms and was shocked at how loud the blast was. As she stared at the creature she could see the bullets rip into the creature, leaving sizable wounds in its grey flesh. Despite the obvious damage the creature remained standing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Minimal damage to target,&quot; Vixi intoned after scanning the creature.<br />
<br />
Cole cursed under his breath as the creature now began to howl. Ann placed her hands over her ears at the bone chilling sound now echoed through the hotel. Cole instinctively knew what this meant, it was calling for reinforcements. The battle of the hotel had begun.</p>
