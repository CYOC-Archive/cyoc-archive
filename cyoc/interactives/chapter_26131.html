<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Practice went as usual for you, but afterward in the shower you noticed your balls were a little more tender than normal. You tuck that little fact into the back of your mind as you dry off and put your clothes back on.<br />
<br />
You hop on your bike to head home, wincing a little as your balls get jumbled. You get home just as your Dad is getting home from work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey kid, how was practice?&quot; He asks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same as yesterday. Just wish I was good enough to be on the varsity team and actually get some action.&quot; You tell him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe if you just keep practicing you will be good enough.&quot; He said running his hand through your hair as you walked inside.<br />
<br />
Your stomach grumbles, telling you it is surprisingly hungry. &quot;So, whats for dinner dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about some steak?&quot; he said putting his things down, &quot;You hungry already? I hope you didn't skip lunch again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I ate, just must have worked alot in practice, real hungry all of a sudden.&quot; You tell him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, will start on it now then.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head to your room and throw on some comfortable shorts and a tank, noticing the tenderness seems to be getting worse. You flick on your TV and watch as your Dad makes dinner. You can already smell the meat cooking, your mouth starting to water.<br />
<br />
Soon the food is ready and you are quickly digging into your food, you are absolutely starving now somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there slow down, you might want to actually chew and taste your food.&quot; Your Dad tells you from across the table.<br />
<br />
You blush a little realizing what you are doing as you slow down. &quot;Sorry Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
You end up having a second portion, finally full you burp as you clean your dishes. Rubbing your full stomach you head up to your room for a little game time before bed.<br />
<br />
A few hours later you are still in front of your computer, the screen lighting your dark room. You yawn, trying to keep your eyes open as you glance over at the clock. Only 9, damn you are usually up until midnight. You yawn again finally deciding to give in as you turn it off, slipping into bed, giving your balls a squeeze. OUCH! Yep, still tender.<br />
<br />
<br />
You open your eyes as the bright light from the hall wakes you, the outline of a person not your Dad in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is that?&quot; you ask, but get no reply as the shadow comes in, closing the door behind. Your eyes are trying to re-adjust to the dark to get a good look, but don't move as it moves closer. You suddenly feel a hand on your leg, slowly moving up your calf to your knee. You try to move but can't, your body just twitches. The hand moves up your thigh, causing your cock to twitch.<br />
<br />
The hand suddenly disappears, but then you feel the weight of a body sitting on your legs. You hear a slight 'Mmmm' as two hands rub across the light hairs on your thighs, reaching up under your shorts, slowly going higher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; You ask, the person starting to look familiar, but the darkness still obstructing you. You feel the hands move up further, your body tensing, trying to resist, but also feeling the best you ever have felt. &quot;What are you doing? Mmmmm&quot; You moan as you get cut off, the hands rubbing your boxer brief clad balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh&quot; The definitely male voice tells you as the hand squeezes your hardening dick.<br />
<br />
His hands suddenly pull out, then you feel them on your stomach, pushing your shirt up. You groan as you feel his tongue lick your smooth navel, the hands moving down and pulling your shorts and underwear, exposing your man hood to the cool air. His hand moves back up your thigh, the fingers pushing through your pubes before wrapping around the base of your cock. You flex it and moan as the soft hand slowly moves up its four inch length.<br />
<br />
Your balls pull against you as a warm wet tongue licks the tip, it's taking everything for you not to cum right then as his wet mouth begins to lower, enveloping the whole thing. You face scrunches up in pleasure as the mouth moves up and down.<br />
<br />
You just can't take it anymore, your balls contracting, waves of pleasure overpowering your brain as you groan, shooting every drop into the warm mouth enveloping you.<br />
<br />
You try to catch your breathe as the mouth and body removes itself from you. You are about to say something when a slight beep beep beep starts ringing in your ears. It is getting louder with every beep until you suddenly open your eyes, room full of light, alarm going off.<br />
<br />
You reach over and turn off the alarm, breathing quick, covered in sweat. It was just a dream you tell yourself. But it was so real! Then you slowly become aware of your tenting shorts, and the wetness around your crotch. Looking down you see it. &quot;SHIT!&quot; you had yourself a full blown wet dream!<br />
<br />
You get up, your morning wood starting to diminish. You quietly open the door, looking out to make sure the hall was clear, quickly getting into the bathroom and locking the door behind you. You turn the shower on, pulling off your sweaty tank, then peeling the icky shorts and boxer briefs off of you before jumping in to wash off.<br />
<br />
It takes a bit of soap, but the stickiness is gone finally and you climb out after washing everything else.<br />
<br />
You grab a towel and dry yourself noticing your balls are not tender anymore at least. You hang the towel and stand in front of the mirror, looking at your crotch, wondering where that crazy dream had come from. You start to harden a little just thinking about it, even if it was a guy sucking you off. You run a hand through your pubes, they almost seem a little thicker and more spread out than you remember. Cupping your balls, they seem a little thicker too. And was the skin around your cut head always that thick?<br />
<br />
You chuckle at yourself as you pick up your toothbrush. Everything just seems different because you want it to be, thanks to that damn vial of shit. You rinse out your mouth, using your hand to dry your mouth, feeling the soft fuzz on your upper lip. You lean in closer to the mirror, hey look that peach fuzz is finally starting to get some color.<br />
<br />
You grab your icked clothes, throwing them in the hamper, good thing you do your own laundry. You peek out the bathroom door, still quite you slip back into your room, going over to your drawer to get a pair of underwear. You slip them on, laughing at yourself again as your subconscious is telling you the are a little tighter in the package than normal. You pull on some shorts next, but don't notice they aren't as baggy as last time. Your shirt is also a little tighter than normal.<br />
<br />
Pulling on your socks and shoes, your basketball shoes are a little harder to pull on than normal, also a little tight. Might be time for a new pair you say to yourself.<br />
<br />
Downstairs you grab a quick bowl of cereal, your Dad soon following you down for the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for school?&quot; He asks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, thrilled!&quot; You tell him sarcastically.<br />
<br />
You clean out your bowl and grab your backpack, saying bye to your Dad as you head out to your bike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes were nothing out of the ordinary all day, but you just couldn't keep your mind off the dream, still unable to think of who it was you dreamt of.<br />
<br />
But that would soon change as you walk into the locker room for practice. Getting dressed you sit on the bench, working to get your shoes back on when Mark moved to his locker next to you. You look up to say hi, seeing his outline your brain made the connection, this was the one you dreamt about. You start to blush as your cock starts to harden in your basketball shorts, not saying anything as you look back down at your shoes, trying to calm yourself down.<br />
<br />
You have no idea why you just reacted like that or where all the new thoughts are floating into your head from, but fuck it feels good. What was in that stuff?!</p>
