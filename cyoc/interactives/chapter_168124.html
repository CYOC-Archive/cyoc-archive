<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dannie brushed off her earlier confusion over titles, got up from her seat with a angelic grace in her high-heels, put on a big smile with her white teeth showing (even though the smile was to mask to what she was really feeling)  and started to quickly walk in short steps towards her boss's door in a sexy runway manner with her feet crossing in front of one another. Dannie opened the door to Pete's office and was met with a shocking sight as Pete was standing in a impressive black and white work suit behind his large desk and looking down at Dannie in the distance with a large smirk on his face. Seeing Pete look at her that way with his probing eyes made Dannie shudder and her smile faltered for a bit before regaining its composure. She stepped into the office closed the door and strutted up towards Pete's desk with his eyes traveling down her body and then back up again. Dannie didn't like that look at all as her lips curled into a frown then she force-straightened them again into her original smile. Right before she got to his desk being around five feet away Pete held up his palm and said sternly "that's enough Danielle" and she stopped in her tracks with her right leg jutting out a little farther then the left and her whole right-side of her body leaning slightly to the side along with head as her hands went to rest on her hips in a curious pose. Dannie had no idea why she was standing in this manner but it felt natural and so she just went with it.<br />
<br />
Pete Looked around the room in a suspicious manner then pressed a button on his desk to cause blinds to retreat down all the windows in his office in a robotic manner he then looked at Dannie and smiled. "Danielle I really am manager of this account I really do have your life" Pete exclaimed in a laughing tone "this is my office, look at this Danielle I have your old life and your wife" Pete grabbed several framed photos from his desk and turned them around to show Dannie as sure enough their was Pete graduating from the university with Dannie's old degree and her old friends, again there Pete was marrying Alexis on there wedding day, and them together in Hawaii on their honeymoon. "I can't believe it Danielle" Dannie piped up "well believe it Mr Simpson for the living evidence before you should be enough proof" Dannie again found herself quietly panicking at the thought that she couldn't call Pete by his first name.<br />
<br />
Pete saw this predicament too in himself "I have to call you Danielle and you have to call me Mr Simpson, it must have something to do with the wish and our roles in this reality. Lets try something Danielle try to get me to call you by your nickname" Seeing where this was going she replied "please Mr Simpson call me Dannie" On queue Pete replied "thank you Dannie, your nickname is a little easier on the tongue I guess." With a big smile as to what was coming next Dannie waited several seconds but Pete said nothing more only smiling at her. Finally after thirty seconds Dannie piped up "So Mr Simpson are you going to ask me to call you by your nickname?" "no Dannie I am Mr Simpson to you, your boss and the title for your superior will not change unless I feel differently" With this revelation Dannie was both surprised and angry "what do you mean Mr Simpson I let you call me Dannie! I'm your best friend and coworker! I gave you what you wanted!" With these remarks Pete's face became stern and he said in an angry tone "No we are not friends, you are my secretary! While you work here you work under me! I expect you to complete your duties on time and do anything I ask of you is that clear Dannie! Dannie was very frightened, the most frightened she had ever been in her life she quickly lowered her head and pouted her lips and with tears rolling down her face answered "Yes I understand Mr Simpson I apologize for my behavior." "That's OK Dannie" replied Pete as his face softened to one of concern "I didn't mean to yell I just think that we should embrace our roles in this reality and that means you accepting your place in the office hierarchy." Pete came around his desk and gently placed his hands on Dannie's face using his thumbs to wipe away the tears in a tender fashion "There, there its OK, we are the best of friends in our original lives but we have to respect who we are in this reality and that includes respecting authority. That way we can learn more about this world from our new viewpoints and have some fun in the process as we come to accept it."<br />
<br />
Dannie had stopped crying and looked up to Pete's eyes with a small smile forming on her pout lips "God damn she's beautiful" Pete thought before Dannie suddenly turned her head away breaking Pete's embrace of her face. Dannie takes a step back and says while making eye contact with Pete "Thanks Mr Simpson but I helped you bring your wish into reality and all I wanted in return was a little fairness and equality in my new role despite what I am and look like" Dave sighed nodded his head and said "Dannie this is my fantasy and dream and you really don't get a say in it when it comes to fairness and equality. I just want you to accept your new role while you have it and become happy with it in the process" Dannie was again shaken and stunned by this revelation from her boss as her mouth dropped open and head vaulted back in exclamation. Dannie realized an idea in her disbelief "What if I use the pen to change things around and make it more fair then we could both be happy and I won't be so low on the pecking order." The next statement from Pete was beyond anything he had said before and caused extreme anxiety and fear to shoot through Dannie's body. "I thought you would say something like that and I have already put precautions in place to prevent you getting the pen."<br />
<br />
"When I was transformed and put in this office I found the magic pen to be sitting in my hand. After the initial shock I immediately began writing down a few rules to keep the pen in my possession and anyone else in the world including you from getting it and wishing away everything. "Long story short Dannie if you or anyone else try to get the pen as you touch it you will become very ill with extreme nausea, dizziness, stomach cramps and headaches which will only increase the longer you hold it, if you do manage to put the tip of the pen to a flat surface the pain will become so extreme that you will not be able to go on and be forced to drop it. The pen will always stay in my possession and is destined to never leave my sight so its going to be quite hard to get to it in the first place." With this explanation tears began flowing down Dannie's cheeks from her bowed head again as the full realization and weight of her mistake came home to roost. Pete piped in while twirling the pen in his hand "Dannie its OK we can still have a friendship when we turn back tomorrow and everything will be back to normal I won't write anything down that will change you physically I promise. I just want to live out my fantasy for one day can you please do that for me and act your part." Dannie wiped the tears from her eyes looked at Pete again with those striking eyes and a big closed smile said with a bubbly tone "OK Mr Simpson I'll act my part as your happy secretary until we change back." "Good Dannie I'm proud of you" Pete exclaimed. With that complement Dannie unintentionally closed her eyes pricked her chin up and beamed happiness in a wide smile but quickly snapped out of it not believing what she just did "its only for one day" thought Dannie.<br />
<br />
In the exact moment that Dannie was thinking to herself the intercom buzzed into life and Joe Dave's manager announced that the two o'clock meeting was starting and he expected Pete to be there on time. Pete shrugged "I have to go Dannie I'll see you again in a little bit but stay out of my office" With that they both turned around in unison and began walking out of Pete's office side by side Pete sneaking glances the whole way. When they got to the door Pete allowed Dannie to go through first "ladies first" he said with Dannie blushing and then followed her out. Pete started to make his way to the boardroom but quickly realized Dannie was right beside him walking her sexy short struts quickly to keep up with him. Everyone in the office continued their work only the men glancing occasional long stares at Dannie which made her shiver all over when she noticed "I should have work clothes for the office not a bikini and heels for the beach runway" Dannie thought.<br />
<br />
Right as he noticed what she was doing and only feet from the boardroom door Pete grabbed Dannie by the upper left arm and pulled her over to the enclave which the door sat under wanting an explanation "Mr Simpson what are you doing!" cried Dannie. "What are YOU doing Dannie! Why didn't you go back to your desk, why are you walking with me to the boardroom?" exclaimed Pete in a slightly annoyed tone. Dannie was a a little confused with this question and why Mr Simpson was holding her arm and annoyed with her, her mouth was slightly open and her eyelids fluttered before she gave a response. "Mr Simpson I was going to the board meeting to give my report on the state of the account I manage?" Pete was annoyed but not at all surprised by this response as he answered "NO I am going to the board meeting to give MY REPORT on the state of the account that I MANAGE! You are a secretary Dannie you don't manage anything other then my schedule." With this Dannie's face went nearly white and a look of shock dotted her face as her eyes went wide, her mouth hung open, and her breathing and anxiety increased "whaaa what no no no I worked really hard on that report I even ignored Alexis for a whole night in order to finish it on time!" Pete was getting pissed now as he told her with a forceful tone "Yes I worked really hard on that report and I even ignored Alexis MY BEAUTIFUL AND FAITHFUL WIFE for a whole night to get it done on time! Dannie began trying to shake out of Pete's grip on her arm but Pete forced her rigid and she quickly stopped "Please Mr Simpson that's my report I really want to announce it to the board I worked really hard" Danny pouted before continuing "Can you let me go PLEASE!" At this Pete calmed down and meeting her eyes directly stated to her in a monotone voice "Look at yourself Danny you are not a male manager anymore you are a female secretary and a piece of eye candy at that. The members will not let you into the boardroom and will not accept that you are the manager of the account or that this packet is your report. Joe already has a copy of the report with my name on it and everyone including the board members know you as my secretary. I truly am sorry Dannie but please go back to your desk and begin making those changes to my schedule that I want done." Dannie was completely floored and defeated at these last remarks she bowed her head in complete realization and was just beginning to cry when Joe poked his head through the slightly cracked open door and said in a firm tone "Simpson get in here I need that report now" Pete quickly answered "I'm sorry sir I'm on my way my secretary just had a quick question for me" " Well she can wait I need that report now, in fact bring her in with you she can stand and watch then be the coffee and snack server later on. Dannie beamed a big smile and her head shot up at this idea as she could still attend the meeting even if she was just a server, maybe they would even allow her to give input to the report. With his hand still grabbing her arm Dannie was quickly pulled by Pete into the boardroom and the door was shut behind them.</p>
