<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Di walked out of one of the many back rooms at the cafe, having just put her clothes back on.  Sex with the cow-woman was incredible.  She realized that her anthropomorphic changes were enormously far reaching.  She hoped her previous wish about not messing anything up too badly would hold.<br />
<br />
One of the things that she had noticed was that a high amount of anthropomorphs were interested in homosexual sex as well as heterosexual sex.  She had wished for them to be more sexual, but didn&#39;t realize that would extend to sexuality as well.  It did seem to make sense, however.  Absentmindedly, Di wished that she knew what the proportion of sexuality amongst anthropomorphs was.  <br />
<br />
The answer popped into her head instantly: approximately 50% of anthropomorphs were bisexual, 25% were purely straight, and 25% were purely gay/lesbian.  These numbers were regardless of the person&#39;s human sexuality.  Changing sexuality didn&#39;t stop people from experimenting with animalistic forms.  In fact, it seemed to encourage the exploration of the hidden fantasies that people had.&#39;<br />
<br />
Di looked around the cafe, having left the back hall.  Margie wasn&#39;t there anymore.  The border-collie-girl who Margie asked out was.  She was eagerly with her coworkers, a tiger woman and a human girl, about a date with &quot;this cute girl&quot; that she would be having on Friday.  It was getting late at this point so Di decided she would head home.  <br />
<br />
On her way out, she heard an uproar of cheers and boos from the table with the card game.  The dog-man and fox-man looked dejected.  The cat-man stood up triumphantly, having apparently won the bet.  He looked about ready to swoon from excitement; his super-erect cock began to visibly throb.  The crocodile-man reached out and grabbed the cat-man&#39;s cock tightly, stopping him from cumming.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said the crocodile-man.  &quot;Save that for the back-room.  Don&#39;t want to muss up the nice floor and give the ladies any extra work.  You&#39;ll be cumming plenty when we&#39;ve got you spit-roasted!  Now let&#39;s get to the fun!&quot;  He picked the cat-man up by his ass and carried him toward the back, with the bull-man, bear-man, and 2 horse-men following after.<br />
<br />
Di then left the cafe and drove home.  It was after midnight and everyone else was already asleep.  Di quietly went to her room.  She took off all of her clothes and threw them into the hamper, then put on a red silk nighty for bed.  Before long she was asleep, but before she drifted off she wished that she would always wake up on time and feel perfectly refreshed.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The next morning, Di woke up on time, feeling perfectly refreshed.  She went through her morning routine, showering and doing her hair and make-up.  Her chosen underwear was a lacy white bra and a hot pink thong.  For her clothes she picked out a cute, light blue, low cut, short sleeve minidress and 4-inch, hot pink, ankle-strap heels.  She also wore dainty- silver chain bracelets on her right wrist, dangly earrings with a diamond shape, and a simple heart necklace.<br />
<br />
She headed out of the house straight from her room.  The only one who saw her was June, who said &quot;Have a nice day,&quot; and winked at her.  Di would have thought the wink was weird, except that she knew that June&#39;s thoughts were beginning to turn.<br />
<br />
Di arrived at school without difficulty and attended class.  Dr. Bimbette&#39;s math class was on Monday and Wednesday.  This Tuesday morning she had Dr. Peggy Brinkle&#39;s macroeconomics class.  Dr. Brinkle was an old woman who had an annoyingly inconsistent teaching style.  She could never keep due dates straight, and the homework was always a grab bag, sometimes easy, sometimes extremely difficult.  The lectures were no better.  But now Di had an opportunity for some more classroom fun.<br />
<br />
Di looked around the room.  The anthropomorph wish still held.  Of the classroom of about 30, 3 of them were anthropomorphs: 1 deer-boy, 1 seagull-girl, and 1 dog-boy of pug breed.  Frieda was also in this class, as was Callie Cockney.  Di decided on a few unrelated wishes, just for fun.  She made her preliminary &quot;nobody notices the changes&quot; command before beginning.<br />
<br />
Di began her commands.  &quot;Dr. Brinkle will age regress until she was only 18 years old, and her name will change to be Dr. Pegg-me Tinkle.  She will now be an excellent economics instructor.  Dr. Tinkle would become beautiful, with D-cup breasts, shapely legs, and a sultry face.  Dr. Tinkle&#39;s clothes will disappear and be replaced with only a purple bikini-bra top and an appropriately sized, girl&#39;s diaper.  Dr. Tinkle will not be incontinent, but simply prefers to wear and use diapers most of the time.  She is also an expert in the use of dildos, butt-plugs, and strap-ons.  She has a full collection of them and carries extras wherever she goes, in addition to extra diapers. <br />
<br />
Di continued.  &quot;Whenever her diaper is full someone will change it for her.  She will be changed wherever she is, even in public.  Often there will be someone who knows her who will offer to change it for her.  If not, then Dr. Tinkle can ask anyone to change her and they will happily do it.  After she is clean, Dr. Tinkle will reward the one who changes her by having sex with them, no matter who they are or where they are.  She will make good use of her penetrative sex-toy expertise when she does so.  Nobody except me will think there is anything strange about these changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Dr. Tinkle stood at the front of the room.  She was beautiful young 18-year-old with a bikini top and a diaper.  As she lectured she took a noisy crap in her diaper, and it started to stink.  Nobody made any reaction, since this was normal for them.<br />
<br />
Di turned to the deer boy.  &quot;You love Dr. Tinkle.  You love her smell and you love changing her diaper.  You even love licking her pee off her crotch when you go down on her.  You love when she pounds your ass with her strap-ons, and you love when she makes you suck on dildos or wear butt-plugs.  You have a thick butt-plug in right now.  You noticed Dr. Tinkle take a crap and you can&#39;t wait to change her after class.  Dr. Tinkle knows you love her, but you are not her only lover, since she loves lots of people.  Nevertheless she still allows you to pursue your passions with her, and you enjoy doing so at every opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di noticed the deer-boy&#39;s exposed cock become fully erect and it began dripping with pre-cum.  He could barely hold in the anticipation.<br />
<br />
Di then saw 2 boys at the front of the class.  They were very smart.  People thought it was unfair how well they did in school while hardly even trying.  She decided to even things out a little.<br />
<br />
She looked at the first boy, a guy named Brett Baxter.  She commanded &quot;You will have a variant of the disability that affects meteorologists.  You have to have your rectum sexually stimulated by a woman with a strap-on in order to do anything academic.  As long as your rectum is being stimulated in this manner, you are smart as you have always been, but when you aren&#39;t being penetrated, you are quite stupid.  You are the only person with this condition.  Your name is now Butter Buster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di looked at the girl sitting behind Brett, a shy, wimpy, nerdy girl named Sheila Whipple.  She said &quot;You will become beautiful, and your breasts will grow until they are D-cups, and your ass and hips will widen and become round and shapely.  You are now 100% lesbian.  You are Dr. Tinkle&#39;s apprentice in the art of using dildos, butt-plugs, and strap-ons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you have a dildo in your vagina, a butt-plug in your ass, or are wearing a strap-on, you will be incredibly strong.  If you have only one of those three things, you will be twice as strong, if you have two of them, you will be four times as strong, and if you have all three, you will be 10 times as strong as normal.  This will not affect your actual muscle mass and you still look like a petite beautiful girl.  You like to help others in need, and Brett is regularly in need of some help.  While in class you fuck his ass with your strap-on in order to help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di turned to the other smart boy, named Hank Jensen, and began commands for him.  &quot;You will have a condition similar to Butter&#39;s.  You will only be able to think about academics while being squished by the fat of a female.  If you are being squished like this, you will be as smart as you have always been, but when this isn&#39;t happening you will be stupid.  You are the only person with this condition.  Your name is now Huggie Gelatin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di then looked at the girl behind Huggie, a popular girl named Judy Newman.  &quot;You will grow until you are 6&#39;6&quot; and will become incredibly obese.  You will love your obese body and you will suffer no ill health effects from it.  You are even still on the cheerleading squad.  You will wear minimal clothing in order to show off your rotund body, and nobody will mind even if you are naked.  You have befriended huggy and regularly allow him to be squished between enormous fat breasts, to help him with his disability.  You also enjoy sitting on him, and he does as well.  You are 100% lesbian and prefer large women like yourself.  In return for helping him, Huggie helps you find lesbian lovers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of these changes will take effect now.&quot;</p>
