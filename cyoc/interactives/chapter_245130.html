<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving within the kitsune realm Mika, Claudia, and their children now began the quick trip through the commercial portion of the capital towards the Castle of the Dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are we here again?&quot; Haley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma and Grandpa could use some cheering up,&quot; Mika replied, the green furred kitsune smoothing her outfit. &quot;Ever since your uncle ended up in S.P.E.A.R custody, they&#39;ve been a bit stressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think a visit from us will cheer them up?&quot; Mason asked as he reached down to pet Fenrir behind the ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know when I was a kid my grandparents always cheered up whenever my parents brought us to visit,&quot; Claudia stated. &quot;Pretty sure its a universal thing. Just try not to bring up Fukushu okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason and his siblings nodded as they continued towards the castle. Tatsu and Shizen had been in constant contact with S.P.E.A.R since the fall of the Superior Church. Fukushu&#39;s arrest was kept quiet by the royal family, however, they weren&#39;t sure how long that would last. If knowledge that the famed general was imprisoned by humans it could lead to further tensions between S.P.E.A.R and the kitsune. For now, all the Harris family wished to do was offer the celestial rulers some needed relief.<br />
<br />
As they approached the stairs leading to the castles heavy doors, they noticed a portal of bluish light begun to swirl. The portal confuses the family, appearing almost liquid. Slowly, a familiar figure stepped onto the steps ahead of them sporting a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Travis,&quot; Mika asked in confusion. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The son of Life and Death sported a friendly smile, waving to the Harris family as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wasn&#39;t expecting you,&quot; he grinned. &quot;This actually works out pretty well. You can help me with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help you with what?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
Travis smirked as he reached his hand inside the portal. Slowly a figure emerged. It was a kitsune vixen with white fur, standing around 5 and a half feet tall, the same height as Kari. Timidly the eight tailed kitsune pulled on her purple kimono as her eight tail is swayed slightly. Mika and Claudia&#39;s jaws dropped as they locked eyes with someone they hadn&#39;t seen in more than 20 years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi,&quot; Kari asked. &quot;But..I thought she was dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically yes,&quot; Travis replied. &quot;However, she doesn&#39;t remember that. In fact her memory is a bit fuzzy right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How...how is this possible?&quot; Mika stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A deal was struck with Annie Pendragon and myself,&quot; Travis stated. &quot;In order to protect the Kane family, Annie interceded taking Linda Michaels in exchange for Yomi. She&#39;s finally free of Lilith&#39;s torment. I&#39;m simply taking her home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Home,&quot; Claudia exclaimed. &quot;She gets to go home?! You do realize she tried to kill me right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, she tried to kill you mom?&quot; Aaron asked in concern. The young kintaro instinctively reaching for his pistols. &quot;When?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Years ago, I was around your age,&quot; Claudia replied, a fireball forming in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa relax,&quot; Travis stated, trying to calm both Mika and Claudia. &quot;There&#39;s things you don&#39;t quite understand. You see Yomi aside from that one instance never truly hurt anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh sure,&quot; Claudia said flatly. &quot;Except that was a big fucking instance there Travis. Who the hell thought this was a good idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia wait,&quot; Mika interrupted, cutting in between her wife and the young reaper. &quot;Just hear me out first okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia frowned, folding her arms across her chest as she now stood in front of her children. As she did Mika sighed, explaining her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you know how we merged with our doppelgangers from the Magic Timeline years ago,&quot; Mika said. &quot;When that happened, I gained the memories of the other Mika and her time when she was the adopted daughter Tatsu and Shizen. That included Yomi. Travis isn&#39;t wrong. When Yomi tried to turn Kellie and Jack into her children, she was trying to save the clan. She just didn&#39;t really think the plan through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I only hearing about this now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because she&#39;s been dead for over 20 years Claudia,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;Look, let me just talk to her okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia huffed, nodding yet keeping an wary eye on the eight tailed kitsune as her wife approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi,&quot; Mika said softly. &quot;Its me, Mika.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomi blinked, tilting her head as she curiously studied the green furred kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika,&quot; she asked, her voice melodic yet confused. &quot;Is that you? You look older?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah its me Yomi,&quot; Mika smiled. &quot;You&#39;ve been gone a long time. I got married. That&#39;s my wife Claudia and those are my children, Kari, Aaron, Haley, and Mason.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomi raised an eyebrow, curiously studying the Harris siblings.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re different,&quot; she stated. &quot;Kari looks like a kitsune. So does Aaron, but Haley is a tiger. Also, Mason is human. Are Kari and Aaron twins? Did you adopt Haley and Mason?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Kari is adopted,&quot; Mika replied. &quot;Aaron and Haley are twins and Mason is our youngest. Those three are all mine. I gave birth to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curious,&quot; Yomi answered, the kitsune tilting her head as she tried to process Mika&#39;s children. Slowly, a warm smile spread across her vulpine face. &quot;Hello my name is Yomi. I&#39;m your mother&#39;s sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Aunt Yomi,&quot; Haley said excitedly. &quot;Nice to finally meet you.&quot; With that the Amazonian tigress kintaro stepped forward, squeezing Yomi in a massive bear hug. The eight tailed kitsune&#39;s eyes bulged under the pressure as Haley lifted her off the ground. As Haley placed her back down, Yomi tilted her head upwards, studying the energetic tigress carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite strong,&quot; she answered. &quot;And loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I get that a lot,&quot; Haley shrugged. &quot;Ya wanna head inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomi nodded timidly as the group now headed inside the castle. As they did, Aaron studied his aunt carefully.<br />
<br />
As Yomi talked with his twin, Aaron analyzed everything he could about the white eight tailed kitsune. Yomi&#39;s voice was melodic with a distinctive accent. It struck Aaron as odd, making the kintaro think of Victorian Era shows Nyx had him binge watch one day. Still, he found it hard to fathom, judging by her body language and mannerisms that she could hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think?&quot; Mason asked his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure,&quot; Aaron whispered. &quot;Hard to believe she tried to kill our moms. She looks like she&#39;s scared of her own shadow. Still, I&#39;m not taking any chances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why your hand&#39;s resting on your gun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better safe than sorry,&quot; Aaron answered, noticing his hand was indeed resting on his pistol. Yomi was a complete mystery to him. She seemed friendly enough, perhaps a bit introverted. Watching her and Haley talk, gave Aaron the impression that Yomi was in a way a combination of both him and Haley. A shy, awkward, kitsune who didn&#39;t quite know how to handle social situations. Maybe her years in the afterlife had affected her more than Travis thought.<br />
<br />
As the Harris family approached the throne room, they could hear Tatsu and Shizen talking. From the sound of it, Tatsu sounded upset with Shizen attempting to calm him. Mason strained his ears trying to listen, his grandparents were talking about his uncle Fukushu.<br />
<br />
&quot;The nerve of that woman,&quot; Tatsu seethed. &quot;The entire incident with that church of fanatics would still be a problem if it wasn&#39;t for Fukushu. Does she not realize he is no longer the monster that once terrorized the mortal realm?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Shizen said softly, taking a sip of tea. &quot;Our son has made great strides through the decades, but as Hailey said he turned himself in. He feels guilty for his past.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is ridiculous,&quot; Tatsu scoffed. &quot;The wizards forgave Fukushu. Why would he feel guilty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps centuries of war have finally caught up with him,&quot; Shizen answered. &quot;Remember, he is a father now. You know how it feels to go from a soldier to a father it alters ones perspective. That and Mason. You&#39;ve seen how fond he is of the boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have,&quot; Tatsu replied, his voice low. &quot;And we should be frightened by that. We are both well aware our son will do everything in his power to protect those he cares for. There&#39;s a reason our people have created legends around him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure he gets that from you,&quot; Shizen teased.<br />
<br />
Mason could see a small frown crack upon his grandfather&#39;s face before he relaxed. Although still a novice in terms of relationships, he could understand his grandmother attempting to soothe his grandfather&#39;s anger. How the pair would react to Yomi though was anyone&#39;s guess as the eight tailed vixen stepped forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy? Poppa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu and Shizen turned. Mason could see his grandfather&#39;s eyes go wide in shock, the celestial kitsune seemingly freezing in place. Shizen&#39;s reaction was much more dramatic.<br />
<br />
A loud gasp escaped the nine tailed vixen&#39;s mouth. Stumbling backwards, her teacup fell from her hand, shattering on the floor. Shizen&#39;s knees began to shake as she whispered a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen collapsed, her legs giving out as she continued to stare at Yomi. Cautiously Yomi approached, kneeling down next to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, are you alright,&quot; she asked nervously. &quot;You don&#39;t look well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen reached a trembling hand upwards, caressing her daughter&#39;s cheek. &quot;Y..you&#39;re alive,&quot; she stammered. &quot;H..how?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I don&#39;t really remember,&quot; Yomi said softly. &quot;Mika says I&#39;ve been gone for quite sometime. Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen said nothing, quickly pulling Yomi into a hug as she began to sob. The celestial stroking her daughter&#39;s fur as she waited with happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re alive,&quot; she cried. &quot;Tatsu! It&#39;s Yomi, she&#39;s ALIVE!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu said nothing, slowly, mechanically approaching his daughter. This wasn&#39;t a ghost, this was his daughter; his flesh and blood daughter returned to life. Sinking down to Shizen and Yomi&#39;s level, the stoic celestial squeezed his daughter and wife in a warm embrace, a tear leaking from his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve come home,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I prayed....wished for this day, but thought it impossible. I&#39;ve missed you my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you too Poppa,&quot; Yomi answered. &quot;I...I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ve been, but...I know that I missed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Tatsu and Shizen reunited with their daughter, the Harris family stood silent. In time they would speak with the celestial kitsune and become reacquainted with their long deceased aunt. For now, they stood as silent watchers, holding vigil over a tragedy that had finally been resolved after so many years.</p>
