<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke looked at the fruit he had just stolen from his sister it was pink and shiny at least he had grabbed a fruit that he wouldn't mind eating that wasn't disgusting or rotting at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK lets see that fruit&quot; kyle said<br />
&quot;i still don't know what your getting out of this whole dare thing ide hardly call this payback when I'm though with you after this your with you had thought of a better dare&quot; Luke retorted.<br />
&quot;I might but for now just eat your... pink fruit? i don't think I've ever seen that color in nature before&quot; kyle said staring at the fruit<br />
&quot;if i get cancer from eating this I'm suing your ass!&quot; Luke yells at Kyle.<br />
<br />
Luke begins to chew on the salty sweet fruit it tasted revolting at first but the taste began to grow on him.  &quot;god that smells disgusting you really like that shit&quot; Jake says trying to ignore the smell<br />
&quot;Its not bad once you get used to it&quot; Luke says eating the fruit in large bites now making sure not to waste a single drop of its juice.<br />
<br />
&quot;so you going to dare me or what?&quot; Kyle asked Luke<br />
&quot;in a minute this is really good&quot; Luke said finishing off the fruit.  &quot;now then whats going on?&quot;<br />
&quot;you going to dare me?&quot; Kyle asked<br />
&quot;Na ill do it tomorrow it getting kind of late lets head to my room&quot; Luke suggests<br />
<br />
&quot;fine&quot; kyle replies.  Kyle Jake and Brooks head upstairs to Luke's room.  &quot;hay guys ill be right there i got to use the bathroom ill be right there in a sec&quot; Lukes says taking a detour to his bathroom.  Entering the bathroom he unzips his pants and takes out his dick (which was well endowed especially for his age) and aims it at the toilet sending out a stream of urine.<br />
<br />
Whistling Luke finishes peeing then suddenly remembers his and Kyle's kiss silently laughing to himself.  Washing his hands he notices hes still thinking about it.  Now getting uncomfortable he stops smiling and starts to leave the bathroom when he notices hes getting hard.  &quot;Shit not now&quot; Luke says to himself.  Doing what He normally does in such embarrassing situations he thinks about his sister &quot;problem solved&quot;.<br />
<br />
leaving the bathroom he quietly closes the door behind him and uneasily heads upstairs now worried about himself.  Opening the door to his room he starts talking with his friends every time he looks at Kyle he quickly darts his eyes away.  a few hours later after playing a few console games and some other shit they get really tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;hay you mind if we stay here tonight its getting kinda late and we don't really have rides&quot; Jake asks<br />
&quot;um sure will your parents be worried&quot; Luke asks<br />
&quot;Na my parents could care less and Kyle's over there let him get away with murder&quot; Brooks replies<br />
&quot;um OK i guess my parents arnt here so we don't really have to ask them&quot; Luke laughs.<br />
<br />
they all get ready for bed Jake headed off to Luke's parents room with Brooks.  Kyle much to Luke's dismay was sleeping in a sleeping bag at the foot of Luke's bed.   They had a uneasy conversation before falling asleep.<br />
<br />
Luke's dreams usually consisted of things like rule the world or showing up to class naked or sometimes of sex with strange girls.   Tonight however was different when he dreamed he dreamed that he and kyle were in the gym showers at school they were talking then Luke noticed Kyle started getting a hard on Luke tried to look away but like in most dreams you cant control yourself.<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Kyle says grinning facing Luke showing everything<br />
&quot;no!&quot; Luke forced himself to say staring at Kyle's still growing erection trying best he could to keep himself from drooling.<br />
&quot;could of fooled me but i guess theres a perfectly good explanation for for that&quot; Kyle says pointing to Luke's groin.   <br />
<br />
Looking down Luke sees his dick hard as a rock pointing strait out.  Luke embarrassed covers himself up only managing to rub his arms against his dick causing him to falls to his knees in pleasure gasping. Kyle walks over his dick next to Luke's face.<br />
&quot;i know you want to see what it tastes like&quot; Kyle says moving even closer to Luke's face.<br />
&quot;no... no... no...&quot; Luke manages to whisper shaking his head in disbelief closing his eyes slowly Luke opens his mouth and begins to suck on the end of kyle's dick.  Luke starts moving faster and faster useing his fee hands to hold and stroke the parts of Kyles dick he couldn't fit in his mouth.  Luke begins to climax when he wakes up.<br />
<br />
Luke woke up suddenly sitting up in bed.  He felt something wet on his dick then he realized he had blown his load in the middle of his dream.  remembering his dream he suddenly realized he was still painfully erect and just remembering the dream seemed to get him off.<br />
<br />
Rushing to the bathroom he pulls his pants off revealing his soaked boxers being tented by a massive hard on.  Carefully taking off his boxers he attempts to wipe off his dick then suddenly imagines Kyle in front of him cleaning his dick off then kneeling down placing Luke's dick in his mouth sending Luke into the throws of a orgasm sending cum all over his arm and the wall.  &quot;Shit what the hell is going on?!&quot; he says cleaning up the mess he made and soaking his boxers so they didn't smell basically telling his parents hay i masturbate!  He could never imagine himself going to his parents saying that and now he had something bigger to worry about telling his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cant be gay i never felt like this before what could have caused this&quot; Luke says to himself.   thinking hard he suddenly remembered the fruit he ate.  It couldn't have been that fruit doesn't do that to you... but some organisms have been known to cause freak genetic changes maby theres a way to reverse this.   Luke then realizes his friends would never understand this and something was bound to slip out.  He doesn't want to be alone in this but he also doesn't want to turn one of his close friends gay by secretly feeding them the fruit.<br />
<br />
&quot;what am i going to do...?&quot; Luke says to himself putting his pants on (now going commando) and throwing his dirty boxers in the wash.  Cleaning himself up so he doesn't smell like he just masturbated.  walking back to his room he opens the door and sees that Kyle had rolled out of his sleeping bag.  Luke was about to walk back to bed when he notices that Kyle had taken off his pants in the sleeping bag and was sporting a erection in his tight underwear the tip of his dick poking out of the waistband. Luke stares at his friends dick for a moment different scenarios playing though his mind passion out waying reason at this point.<br />
<br />
what is he going to do?</p>
