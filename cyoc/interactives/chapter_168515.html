<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was conflicted in many ways, but also heavily surprised by the rapid and dramatic change the Chapman family&#39;s life. It had started as a rather peaceful summer day with Jeff, his twin Lucy, and their younger siblings Zoe, Grace enjoying time off from college and some measure of relaxation. It then lead to a mid-morning visit by a pair of Slug People, Megan and Jenny who had apparently just moved in next door. It was a bit of a surprise, as the race of anthropomorphic gastropods were both rare and often surrounded in mystery. Scientists were always a bit puzzled on their evolution and some theories supposed that &quot;magic&quot; was involved given how most sightings of Slug People weren&#39;t noted until the Medieval Period in Europe&#39;s history and were originally only in Europe. However, Jeff had accepted many of the arguments that said that magic wasn&#39;t real and that there had to be some other explanation, and those that believed in magic were either speaking in metaphors or just &quot;nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, some of that changed as Megan and Jenny arrived and joined them for dinner. The two Slug People generally behaved as what he&#39;d picked up on the known behaviors of Slug People in school, but a lot of that was general and vague. Beyond a few basic details, there wasn&#39;t much that Jeff could really know in terms of the full details. At first it had been a rather normal dinner and Megan and Jenny seemed polite enough, but then things began to get weird. The slime from Megan and Jenny had dissolved all their clothing then they took interest in Jeff&#39;s own prominent erection that was hard to hide from the two naked Slug Women... and even his own mother, Whitney Chapman, got interested in it. A part of him felt that he should have resisted, as while Slug People were known for loving contact and being a very sexual race, he and his family WAS Human and that sort of behavior, particularly within families was NOT typical among Humans. But he&#39;d felt like he was in a haze until Jenny and his mother got him to have an orgasm before his mother then physically turned into a Slug Woman, herself. Jeff and his siblings managed to escape to what was normally their mother&#39;s room to find that they couldn&#39;t open the windows or break the glass and while they had locked the bedroom door, they were trapped in the room. That was enough to keep them trapped and making Jeff rethink his opinions on magic.<br />
<br />
Things were only escalated as something from outside the room, likely some pheromone from Megan and Jenny or their transformed mother helped drive all of the Chapman children to still feel aroused, even with no Slug Person in the room, at the time. But that eventually lead to Grace&#39;s transformation before him into a Slug Woman as well. She was about the same height as she always was, though the eye stalks did increase it a little as they rose up from the bangs of her red hair. There were a smaller pair of stalks near the corners of her mouth that didn&#39;t end in eyes while from her &quot;Human&quot; waist her body transitioned into a long slug&#39;s tail with a specialized fold of skin covering the opening to where her vagina was and her penis above it. That tail was largely a grayish white with long black spotted stripes that ran along the tail lengthwise to its tip. The one thing that differed Grace presently from Megan or Jenny... or even their mother, now... was that Grace largely remained still and wasn&#39;t presently aroused any more, but she was between Jeff and the doorway into the main part of the bedroom where Lucy and Zoe were supposed to be sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace...?&quot; Jeff said slowly and nervously, hoping that his youngest sister didn&#39;t decide to jump him about this &quot;hive&quot; that Megan and Jenny had talked about creating.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still me...&quot; Grace said slowly and with something of a sad frown as she looked down at her self and could feel her body producing the same sort of slime that Megan and Jenny had used to dissolve their clothing earlier in the evening, &quot;for the most part, anyway... though physically... I am now a Great Grey Slug Woman...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great...&quot; Jeff said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the species Limax Maximus... normally from Europe... but with Slug People... the specific mundane Slug our bodies take on will always vary, even within families,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;Mom became a Worm Slug Woman... Boettgerilla Pallens... for example.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked at this with some surprise as the two talked quietly, hoping not to panic the rest of his siblings. A lot of this went over his head, as while he and Lucy were seniors in college and Zoe was a junior in college, and Grace was a sophomore in college, they all had different interests. Jeff had some interest in computer science and largely hoped to use those skills to help create video games, Lucy was interested in art and being &quot;herself,&quot; Zoe was interested in athletics, and the most academic of them was Grace... but so far as Jeff knew, while Grace&#39;s favorite subject was science, she was more interested in chemistry than anything else and right now what had been said sounded more like biology.<br />
<br />
&quot;How... how do you know this?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it is the classes I&#39;ve taken... both in high school and college... and biology is included, even as a Chem Major,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;but some of it is in relation to the hive mind that all Slug People have... We&#39;re all sort of connected to each other, and unless mom, Megan, and Jenny are asleep right now... they will know my transformation has physically manifested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took a step back with a small gulp, as since whatever initial spell that Megan and Jenny had cast was broken... he really wasn&#39;t keen on being a Slug Person. Grace noticed this and frowned, letting her eye stalks droop a little for a moment and then backed up a bit. She hoped that would ease Jeff&#39;s fears as she then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... it is a two way street,&quot; Grace spoke, &quot;in a way... I also know what Megan and Jenny&#39;s plan is and I think I can help keep us... and maybe even mom... safe from them. Keep us independent from them.&quot;<br />
<br />
That caught Jeff&#39;s attention and he nodded, &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This might be best done in conversation with everyone... as there are some things that none of you will like,&quot; Grace sighed, &quot;Regardless of whether or not we are free of Megan and Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed semi nervously as Grace backed up and gave him room to exit the bathroom. He found Lucy and Zoe still cuddled together in a way, though for the moment they weren&#39;t moving about much. Though he did notice some sweat on on their bodies and that made him wonder if they were moving into the same early stages of the transformation that Grace had just gone through. He approached Lucy and slowly shook her shoulder. She came to groggily and this stirred Zoe a bit. She blinked to Jeff and looked to him with some confusion before glancing to the bedside clock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff... it&#39;s twelve thirty in the morning... what&#39;s going on?&quot; Lucy said with a yawn while Zoe was wiping her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something has happened,&quot; Jeff said slowly, &quot;and I need both of you to keep it down... mom, I think is asleep outside the door to the bedroom... but I don&#39;t know where Megan and Jenny are at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Zoe asked as she sat up to see Grace sitting calmly at the foot of the bed. She was about to shriek when Grace raised one hand to her lips as if to shush her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace?&quot; Lucy and Zoe said together after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I transformed,&quot; Grace said slowly, &quot;but I&#39;m largely still &quot;me&quot; and I know what Megan and Jenny are up to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know?&quot; Lucy asked blinking to Jeff and then back to Grace, who remained still and despite the fright of seeing their youngest sister as a Slug Woman, Grace had taken no aggressive action or nothing that appeared to be mindlessly sexual the way their mother had been when she first changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;All Slug People are connected through a sort of &quot;Hive mind,&quot; thus why Megan and Jenny were talking about a Hive at dinner and why mom picked up on it when she changed. We&#39;re all connected to it in a way... even if our individual minds disagree with something others are doing. Thus I know their plans and what they have done... though they will also know my resistance to them and my allegiance to my family... and OUR hive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren&#39;t slugs, Grace,&quot; Zoe said, her voice rising above the hushed whisper that the four had been speaking with so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the moment, that is true,&quot; Grace nodded, &quot;I am the only one of us... aside from mom... that has completed the full transformation. But I am afraid that the spell that will lead to that transformation has already been cast and all of us were affected. And in certain ways... you, Lucy, and Jeff are already changing. It just hasn&#39;t reached the point where that transformation fully manifests physically and your minds connect to the hive mind that all Slug People are connected to... but Megan and Jenny did successfully cast that spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How... why... Magic?&quot; Lucy managed, her mind racing at a million miles a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... its magic,&quot; Grace sighed softly, &quot;all Slug People have that transforming magic as part of their abilities. Some of it is a defense mechanism, as while our back and hip muscles are powerful to help us balance, we can&#39;t break through doors or survive gunfire. It&#39;s something we need to deal with those that might do us harm. But its a rather simple amount of magic that most Slug People would only use with someone who is willing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning that Megan and Jenny broke &quot;slug law&quot; as it were?&quot; Jeff asked, his mind still processing what had Grace had said that all of them would transform.<br />
<br />
&quot;More cultural norms than any specific law,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;and I get some sense that something or someone is controlling them, somehow. Which could make sense, given that Slug People were created by witches and warlocks in the Middle Ages looking to use our eggs as spell ingredients. Those witches and warlocks got caught in the inquisition and Slug People had to rely on their rather weak transformation and &quot;illusion&quot; magics to keep Humans from destroying our species entirely. They seem to think on a master who&#39;s sent them here after us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But couldn&#39;t that mean they&#39;re victims, just as we are?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... but we&#39;d need to get them to say more,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;the hive mind connects us... but it isn&#39;t perfect telepathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it would mean that if someone else is controlling them,&quot; Zoe said slowly, &quot;then that&#39;d mean that that master seeks to control us if we become slugs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was probably the original intent,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;but it&#39;s not if. It&#39;s WHEN. All of us were exposed to the transformation spell through their slime and their attention on mom and Jeff... and while I may have been the first of us to transform physically, it will happen to you in time. There is no way that I can counter it and neither could Megan or Jenny. In this, about the best we can do is keep OUR hive separate from the two of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least until we can find a way to deal with this master of theirs,&quot; Jeff commented, &quot;as I&#39;d bet that he was the one behind the mind control spell that&#39;s on mom...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But then... how is it that that spell on mom is still with her and we&#39;re free?&quot; Zoe asked, &quot;if all this magic came from Megan and Jenny first and they are controlled by this &quot;master,&quot; why is it that Grace isn&#39;t if they cast the transforming spell at the same time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s because we managed to break free of that control spell before our transformations began...&quot; Grace said softly, &quot;so yes the spell was cast, but the transformation and the mind control spell are different. Thus one didn&#39;t control the other and... as mom transformed first, she was too lost in how GOOD the transformation feels... that she wasn&#39;t fighting to break free of that mind control spell that this &quot;master&quot; cast through Megan and Jenny. In this... we MIGHT be able to free mom from it if we can get her to recognize that Megan and Jenny aren&#39;t family and aren&#39;t part of the hive that we belong to. That we are separate from Megan and Jenny. Mom would then have to choose between us and them... and if her love for us is real... that MIGHT break the mind control spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods at that. Grace could tell that Lucy and Zoe were a bit uneasy over things given how their mother had tried to go after Jeff as she transformed, but that was to be accepted. Megan and Jenny&#39;s arrival and everything that came with it were all part of the odd and even chaotic things that had enveloped the Chapman family&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one more thing... that I would ask, if you could answer, Grace,&quot; Lucy asked slowly. Grace nodded in reply, &quot;If Megan and Jenny cast this transforming spell on all of us and put most of their focus on mom and Jeff... why is it that YOU were the one to transform fully after mom? I mean you were the last one that they interacted with in the hallway when they were meeting everyone... you got the least amount of slime on you... and yet YOU are now a full Slug Woman, like Megan and Jenny... like mom... but Jeff hasn&#39;t shown any signs of transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither are Lucy and I,&quot; Zoe added.<br />
<br />
&quot;With Jeff... that&#39;s because he likely is becoming a male Slug Person,&quot; Grace said slowly, &quot;and that&#39;s slowing down a lot of his transformation at present... particularly while trying to fight its effects. For normally, Slug People are all hermaphrodites, having male and female reproductive organs. In this, if simply having a hive was all Megan and Jenny wanted, they didn&#39;t NEED us or even Jeff. They could mate with each other and likely with any children they sire from each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all weird... and incest,&quot; Lucy interrupted with a firm tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;From a scientific perspective... our technology probably would agree,&quot; Grace nodded, &quot;but remember the rather low levels of magic that all Slug People carry and how their culture has largely tried to avoid to much in the way of conflict with Humans. In this they aren&#39;t going to have much contact beyond their families... and their magic in an odd way removes any genetic relations between family members. In this we could test Jeff and I know... and some tests would say we ARE siblings while others would say we AREN&#39;T siblings and both would technically be correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes no sense,&quot; Jeff commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only from the perspective of one who&#39;s lost belief in magic,&quot; Grace answered back with both eyes focused on her brother, &quot;but it is very real. Its laws may be different from science&#39;s laws, but they are real all the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Jeff said looking down as Grace returned to her original answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;But because Jeff is likely becoming a male Slug Person... the only kind of Slug Person that would have ONE gender,&quot; Grace continued, &quot;that&#39;s likely slowing down his transformation... But even that is proceeding. Jeff is changing... and as are Lucy and you, Zoe. Some of the insanely high levels of arousal that all of us have had, even since coming in here is proof of that transformation and its progression. You and Lucy were practically having sex as you two went to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy and Zoe both blushed and looked away from each other for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that also means that you can and may even be unconsciously casting that transformation spell as well,&quot; Grace continued, &quot;as if you&#39;re trying to complete your own transformations and thus form OUR hive yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s what transformed you?&quot; Zoe asked, &quot;you got horny and transformed yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... we all got horny, and while you two were on the bed rubbing yourselves against one another,&quot; Grace said to Zoe, &quot;Jeff and I were on the floor... and a part of me just wanted to be close to someone... to feel loved... to wish that mom hadn&#39;t just become a Slug Woman and tried to rape us... and Jeff was there and I was happy for the hug and comfort. But then he got horny too... and well... I couldn&#39;t resist and saw Jeff in &quot;agony&quot; as it were... so... I gave him a blowjob to try and get him to relax. But from there... THAT is when things for me began to accelerate. It tasted wonderful and in a way... I did want more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean...?&quot; Jeff asked as his face paled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave me a more concentrated dose of that transformation spell than what Megan and Jenny gave me, Lucy, and Zoe,&quot; Grace nodded, &quot;I probably would have transformed anyway without it, but it would have taken longer. You merely accelerated what was already going to happen... and showing that you are transforming as well. Not as fast because you&#39;re probably going to be a male Slug Person and because like Lucy and Zoe, you&#39;ve been trying to fight it... but it&#39;s still happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; was all Jeff managed as Lucy and Zoe looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;I was already reaching a mental point where I was debating over giving in just to get mom back... and once I began to transform and began to connect to the hive mind... I had no desire to go back. And I do not want to go back now... even if I could. And it isn&#39;t that bad... at least with my mind free of the mind control spell this &quot;master&quot; cast... and our real battle will be freeing mom from it and keeping OUR hive separate from Megan and Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can wait until tomorrow... when trying to figure out a way around all this,&quot; Lucy spoke, &quot;but for now... we should get some sleep... and Grace...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t do anything unless you WANT it to happen,&quot; Grace promised and moved over the door to the bedroom laid down as a sign of not being aggressive or anything else. The others took what she had to share fairly well, but it was also late and she couldn&#39;t be sure on how much they believed.</p>
