<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It would have been the most embarrassing shopping experiences Kyle has ever had if he still looked like hinself. Granted, it was still highly uncomfortable asking a lady to measure him so he could buy the appropriately sized maid outfit, but at least to anyone&#39;s knowledge, he was a hot woman named Kylie. He was even fully conscious when his body drove his mother around town to collecting various items and such for his new uniform.<br />
<br />
Kylie happily accepted the bag from the cashier and excitedly left the shop. She got into the car and drove herself and her Mistress back to her home. Once there, Kylie quickly changed into her new outfit. <br />
<br />
The corset pushed up her monstrous sized breasts, but stopped a few inches above her midriff too. While the micro skirt couldn&#39;t even cover half of her asscheeks. Her apron had to take up the role of hiding her pussy instead. Her legs were hairless and long already, so adding the pair of towering high heel stiletto pumps only amplified their sexiness even further. Panties were of course, banned entirely. But all in all, Kylie was ecstatic about how she looked in the mirror. She felt that she looked amazing, which Kyle had to agree with. If it were not for the fact that she is him, he would have been drooling over her.<br />
<br />
While swaying her hips as she walked down the hall, Kylie sought to find her Mistress. She really wished to show her wonderful new attire to her Mistress. She found Amy in her bedroom, seemingly waiting for her already. &quot;Ah, you look perfect Kylie. A slut to the max!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you so much Mistress!&quot; beamed Kylie. She hurriedly made her way over to her Mistress after she beckoned for her to come closer. Once next to her, Amy&#39;s kind and gentle face disappeared and was replaced by a powerful glare of intimidation. &quot;Kylie, put your right foot in the ceiling.&quot; Commanded Amy.<br />
<br />
Kylie immediately lifted her right leg and without using even her arms to help, stuck her foot straight upwards and placed the bottom of her heel on the ceiling in a perfect vertical split. Amy stands up and presses a remote controlled vibrator into Kylie&#39;s pussy and asshole. She even used some kind of glue so that they would not fall out unless a special fluid was used. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, go and take Ally for a walk. When you return, leave her with me and then go clean the entire house. When that is finished, make dinner in time for 5:30pm. And after we eat, clean everything up. Finally once all of that is completely done, return to me and await further orders.&quot; Kylie&#39;s face brightened even more as she excitedly accepted her new list of tasks. She loves being a maid and especially doing tasks and chores for her Mistress. <br />
<br />
Kylie quickly grabbed the leash and collar for Ally, but was stopped by Amy. &quot;Kylie, you will be the one wearing the collar and Ally will hold your leash in her mouth.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course Mistress!&quot; Said Kylie as she fastened the dog collar around her own neck. She then found Ally, licking her own crotch, in the kitchen and handed her the leash, which she took in her mouth and pulled towards the front door. Kylie stumbled from the sudden tug to her neck, but quickly regained her footing, only to nearly collapse again as both of the vibrators inside of her simultaneously went off briefly. Kylie powered through it and opened the front door, only to be once again nearly pulled down by Ally suddenly running out of the house through it. <br />
<br />
Ally, who at the moment was no different than any other dog, just was happy to be going out for a walk. From the window, Amy watched her 2 transformed children with a mixture of elation and regret. She is having the most fun she has had in a long time, but part of her does know it is wrong to force her kids like this, even if it is a &quot;punishment&quot;. Even that was not really accurate as she basically had used that as an excuse to do it. But she didn&#39;t plan to stop either as perhapse life like this would be the best. Guarenteed obedience from her kids, a fully cared for home, no cooking responsibilities, and she didn&#39;t have to pay even a single dime for it. All she has to do is buy food, and that&#39;s it. <br />
<br />
Ally would stay out of trouble, or be a good kid when not a dog. And Kyle likely wouldn&#39;t be making too much of an appearance anymore, as Kylie was so much better, nicer, happier, etc... that not having her around would actually feel somewhat depressing for Amy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, since Kylie is technically now a completely unrelated person to me, perhaps maybe a closer relationship could be formed between us?&quot; Amy wondered to herself as she stopped watching her stumbling slutty maid and her bitch for a daughter.</p>
