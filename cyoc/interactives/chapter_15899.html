<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Ty made Kent stand in front of the mirror, Kent was overcome by a strange tingling feeling that passed through his entire body. Ty had decided to take over, and his magic would transform Kent exactly the way he had envisioned him to look by just thinking about it. All Ty had to do is just think about how he wanted Kent to look, and his body automatically started to transform into the likeness that Ty had in the back of his mind.<br />
<br />
“What… What are you gonna do to me, Ty?” Kent said, feeling a little nervous. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Kent” Ty replied. “You’re gonna look awesome! You have no idea how popular you’ll become!”<br />
<br />
Kent slowly started to grow taller and taller. He was about 5 feet and 5 inches tall, and he looked around and found the room shrinking as he continued to grow. His legs and torso grew longer, making his body stand taller with every passing moment. Within minutes, Kent was standing about 7 feet and 7 inches tall! He looked like a basketball player!<br />
<br />
“Ooohhh…” Kent gasped, as he realized that he could now touch the ceiling in his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Now, put on some black jeans and a black t-shirt, Kent!” Ty ordered.<br />
<br />
“Huh? What?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kent looked down as he noticed his legs started moving toward the dresser in his room. Kent looked around through the closet. But it wasn’t Kent who was doing it; it was Ty.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see what we got here…” Kent heard Ty’s voice say inside of his head. Kent browsed through all the shirts, until it found a black shirt. He grabbed the hanger that the shirt was hanging on, and he pulled it out of the closet.<br />
<br />
“Now, grab me your black jeans, Kent” Ty ordered. Immediately, Kent’s body obeyed, and Kent took the black jeans out of the drawer. He then slipped in to the jeans and the shirt, before his legs made him walk back towards the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Now, watch this, big guy!” Ty laughed. <br />
<br />
The jeans transformed into shining, black leather! There were several metallic zippers attached to the pants, along with a black, leather belt with a huge buckle. His cotton t-shirt transformed as well and the cotton fabric slowly changed into thick, black leather as well. Within moments, Kent was completely dressed in black.<br />
<br />
Big, black leather boots appeared to cover his legs from the knees down to his feet, with high heels! He was shining in black leather, although there was nothing else attached to his outfit at that moment.<br />
<br />
The 12-inch heels, attached to the 9-inch soles of his huge platform soles made the 7 ft 7” Kent appear to be over 8 feet tall, which was huge! Kent was like a giant dressed in leather!<br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” Kent whispered to himself, as he admired his reflection in the mirror. He had grown so tall, that he could barely see his entire body in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s take care of the hairdo!” Ty laughed out loud.<br />
<br />
Kent’s short, jet-black hair suddenly grew longer, especially on top and in the center of his head. Flocks of hair suddenly strung together and the row of hairs started to stick straight up into the air, forming a black row of hair which began to look like a Mohawk.<br />
<br />
Next, the black row of spiked hairs began to change colors. A colorful row of hairs quickly resembled a rainbow, as the colors ran from bright red in the front, to dark purple in the back! His Mohawk was so long, that the top hairs almost touched the ceiling in his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Holy makeral!” Kent said out loud, as he stared at his reflection in total shock.<br />
<br />
“Kent, from the moment you show up at the party, you will become a people magnet!” Ty chuckled. “You look stunning!”<br />
<br />
“How… How am I gonna get there?” Kent whispered. “I can barely get through the door! I’m so big!”<br />
<br />
“Just close your eyes!” Ty’s voiced boomed inside of his head. “I will transport you to the place where the party is!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kent vanished in thin air! Moments later, at the house of one of the classmates, a flash of lightning struck the ground. A ring of sparks suddenly disrupted the party, forcing all the people to back off. All the sparks converged together, and the lightning immediately changed into the form of the nearly 8-foot tall Kent!<br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! Who’s that?” one of the guys wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Hey! It’s Kent!” Allen shouted, since he was the first to recognize the tall, leather-wearing kid.<br />
<br />
“Kent! You look amazing!” Allen shouted, as he walked up to Kent. He stood right in front of him, and looked straight up so he could talk to the tall kid.<br />
<br />
“There he is!” Ty and Peter shouted, as they entered the large, back yard at the house where the party was taking place.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a small crowd of people had begun to form, consisting of teens who wanted to get a closer look of the tall kid with the huge Mohawk on his head. Kent was the tallest person at the party, and he had to look down at everybody who addressed him.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty just looked on, as more people started to notice Kent’s presence. In order to help things along, Ty decided to make Kent grow even more buff and muscular. His chest grew larger, pushing his arms out further while his shoulders grew wider. Not only that, but his quads and his calves inflated a little more, and it was clearly shown through the tight, leather pants that Kent was wearing. His muscles were almost bursting out of the leather suit, but Ty made sure that he wasn’t getting too big.<br />
<br />
Three of the most beautiful girls in school walked up to him, and they all took turns kissing Kent on his cheeks. At first, Kent was too shy to allow anyone to touch him, let alone kiss him. But the girls insisted, and he was forced to bend down so that they could each take turns kissing him.<br />
<br />
“Time for Kent to get over his shyness” Ty chuckled, as he kept a close eye at Kent.<br />
<br />
Not only were the girls walking up to Kent to say hi to him, shake his hand, or kiss him. Several guys also wanted top meet him, pat him on the back, and a few of them even wanted to get their picture taken with them standing right next to him.<br />
<br />
About thirty minutes after he arrived, about twenty people had gathered around him, taking turns to talk to him, touch him, shake his hand, ask him questions, or to have their picture taken while standing right next to him.<br />
<br />
Ty decided to make things even more interesting. Chains of silver and gold appeared, attached to the different clips and zippers. Within moments, Kent’s black leather jacket was covered with pieces of gold and silver, jewelry, chains, small medals and ribbons.<br />
<br />
The cool thing was that Kent still remained Kent, the geeky kid who always wanted to be nice and help everybody. He didn’t put anybody down, and gave everyone a smile, and he greeted every person who greeted him.<br />
<br />
The most incredible thing took place, when Kent wanted to use the restroom. He walked into the bathroom, but lost his way when he came out a few minutes later. Instead of walking back to the back yard, Kent actually ended up walking toward the front yard of the house. <br />
<br />
Now, there were two other parties going on at that same street. As soon as Kent stepped outside of the house, someone at the other parties spotted him, and began to shout things at him.<br />
<br />
“Look! Look at him! Check out that guy!” some one shouted.<br />
<br />
Heads turned and people looked up. Suddenly, several girls began to scream, and a group of guys started running towards Kent.<br />
<br />
“Look at him! He looks so cool!” another girl screamed.<br />
<br />
Two girls immediately fainted, and three others almost crashed into Kent!<br />
<br />
Poor Kent. Within moments, he got mobbed by a crowd of almost sixty people, who all came storming at him. The crowd of people surrounding Kent got so big, that the cars had to detour. Nobody else could pass through the road, because of the mob that encircled Kent.<br />
<br />
“Kent! Can I shake your hand?” one of the girls asked him.<br />
<br />
“You’re so handsome! May I give you a kiss?” another girl practically begged him.<br />
<br />
“I want a picture!!” another guy shouted.<br />
<br />
“Get his autograph!” someone else yelled out.<br />
<br />
Kent found himself surrounded by almost a hundred teens, who looked up at him and treated him like he was a movie star, a celebrity, or a rock star.<br />
<br />
“Look at Kent!” Ty chuckled, as he and Peter looked on. “It’s gonna take Kent all night just to walk home. He’ll be surrounded by people, everywhere he goes tonight!”<br />
<br />
“What about tomorrow? Or Monday, when he has to go back to school?” Peter asked him.<br />
<br />
Ty just stared at him with a grin.<br />
<br />
“I made it where Kent’s popularity would only increase over time. He’ll be the most popular kid on the planet!”<br />
<br />
“Wow…” Peter replied. All he could do was wonder, how Kent would deal with his new found fame and popularity.</p>
