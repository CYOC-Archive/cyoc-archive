<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up and see that it is now around 6pm. You can feel your stomach rumble a little since you haven't eaten since you've come to this place. Looking down, you notice your sister/girlfriend is missing, but you can hear the shower running. Deciding you want to eat out tonight, you look through the hotel's guide for restaurants in the area.<br />
<br />
While looking through the guide, you see that your cell phone has one missed call. As you get up to see who it is, you hear the shower stop and your sister get out. Not paying any mind to this, as she would be a minute before she was ready to come out, you pick up your phone and check the number. What you see is your parent's number. You figure it was your mother calling to see if you made it ok, since she is always against traveling, especially air travel.<br />
<br />
You hit the call back button and wait while it rings. &quot;Hello&quot; you hear your mom answer. &quot;Hey mom, it's me. Just calling to let you know I got here alright.&quot; &quot;Oh thank goodness&quot; she starts. &quot;You have no idea how worried I was. I mean, you told me the flight was getting in around 1pm, and that you should be at the hotel by 1:30. It's six there right now, isn't it?&quot; &quot;Yes mom&quot; you respond, not liking how worried she was acting. &quot;I am sorry I didn't call you any sooner, but I took a nap as soon as I got here.&quot;<br />
<br />
While this was being said, your sister/girlfriend had come out of the bathroom with her hair done, but still only wearing a towel. &quot;Well&quot; your mom begins again, &quot;just don't let it happen again. Oh, is your sister there? I want to ask her how she is liking her first trip to the beach.&quot; &quot;What? What are you talking about?&quot; you ask, stunned. &quot;You know, your sister. The girl you took on the trip with you. Don't tell me you already lost your little sister there?&quot; &quot;Uh n-no&quot; you respond, startled by the situation, &quot;she is right here.&quot; You hand the phone to your sister/girlfriend and tell her it's mom. &quot;Oh hey mom, what's up?&quot; she starts as the conversation between her and your mother picks up.<br />
<br />
You sit there and stare. You know just earlier today that this girl was your girlfriend and not your sister. However, here you are, listening to a conversation between your mother and &quot;little sister&quot; like she has always been that way. But now that you think about it more, you are having trouble remembering anything about the girl you thought of as your girlfriend. You can't recall how she sounded, how you meet, what she looked like, or even her name. Even stranger was that you were actually starting to remember a life with a little sister. It seemed the little lie you told yourself about her being your real sister had come true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok mom, I'll talk to you later. Bye.&quot; Your little sister hanged up the cell phone and looked at you. &quot;Uhm, are you feeling alright? You look a little pale like you've seen a ghost or something.&quot; &quot;Y-yeah, I am ok. Hey sis, could you give me a quick run down on how we got together? You know, just for old times sake.&quot; Your sister, still giving you a concerned look asks, &quot;Are you sure your alright?&quot; You nod to her and she shrugs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well ok, what the hell. Let's see, I think we started our fun when I was about 7, and you were 10. We saw people on TV kissing and groping each other, so we did the same. After we got scolded by mom once for kissing, we made sure that our parents never saw anything again. After kissing, groping, and eventually french kissing, you came home one day and said you learned something new from the internet. I think I was 9 at the time, and that was the first day I gave a blow job. About a week later, maybe, you ate me out for the first time. We kept going like that till I was 11. It was during the summer, and you told me you loved me more than anything else. That night I gave you my virginity. Finally, when I was 13, I convinced mom to buy me birth control to help with my period and we have never used a condom since. Does that sound about right.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded again. Everything she said seemed true, and every detail you remember very vividly. If all of this was correct, then somehow reality had altered, and you were now in a world where you not only had a little sister, but you had a very special relationship with her too. This all seemed really weird, but very natural at the same time. It was then you decided that you were going to get to the bottom of things once you had some alone time. &quot;Haha, sorry to worry you sis. I think I just slept funny or something. Maybe I need some food in me&quot; you finish right as your stomach growls again.<br />
<br />
Your sister laughs too. &quot;Yeah, I am a bit hungry myself. Whaddya say we get ready and go out? I could really go for some Italian tonight.&quot; You agree as you both put on some clothing to go out. Once you were dressed, you walk over to your sister and kiss her deeply. Whether this was your girlfriend, or actually your little sister, it doesn't matter as this was still the girl you loved. After you break the kiss, your sister speaks. &quot;Wow bro, someone is getting a little passionate today.&quot; &quot;Well yeah sis. Back home we can never do stuff like this openly. However, here I can show you my love openly without fear of friends or family finding out&quot; you explain.<br />
<br />
You sister smiles, and kisses you again for a short time. &quot;Well I guess this vacation is going to be something special then. I can't wait to come back here for dessert.&quot; As she says this, your sister rubs your crotch a little. You know later you are going to find out just how this world came to be, but for tonight you are just going to enjoy things as they are. With one more quick kiss, you both head out the door to dinner.</p>
