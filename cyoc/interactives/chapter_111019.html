<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jesse, not actually believing that the program worked, scrolled down until he came across an option for mental changes. There were options for sexuality, intellect, basic personality traits, phobias and even fetishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, they thought of everything with this,&quot; Jesse laughed, &quot;So I&#39;ll use the program to change your mind, literally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fun,&quot; Nick laughed back, &quot;So let&#39;s see what you can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where should I start?&quot; Jesse wondered, boggled by the sheer number of options available.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go with fetishes,&quot; Nick offered, &quot;That should be good for a laugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, since you&#39;re the world&#39;s most boring person when it comes to stuff like that,&quot; Jesse teased, &quot;I mean what, you&#39;re twenty three and still haven&#39;t had a girlfriend. I bet you&#39;re still a virgin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?&quot; Nick countered, &quot;It&#39;s not like you&#39;ve got anything going on right now, between work and all the online courses you&#39;re taking trying to finish up college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken,&quot; Jesse conceded, &quot;So, fetishes it is then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two friends fell silent as they looked over the list before them. Some were disgusting, some were strange, some were frightening, and more than a few were all three.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bondage?&quot; Jesse offered gently after scrolling back up toward the top of the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Nick laughed, &quot;Because I&#39;m totally into being tied up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clicking that option brought up a whole new set of options and Jesse chose ones that he thought sounded as far removed from Nick as possible, just because of how absurd it all was.<br />
<br />
Finally, after a great deal of clicking and even more laughing they had a set of options chosen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Subject name is Nicholas Miller. We&#39;ve got bondage, masochism, extreme submission, and leather chosen as options. Is there anything else we want?&quot; Jesse asked.<br />
<br />
Nick shook his head, laughing too hard to actually talk.<br />
<br />
Trying not to burst out laughing, Jesse clicked &#39;Accept&#39; which brought him to an other, less interesting menu. This one was strange options, things like duration of change, reality settings and awareness. Not sure what to do for Jesse just kept the defaults, which were: &#39;Adjust Reality: All Except User&#39;, &#39;Subject Awareness: Off&#39;, &#39;Time of Change Process: 1 Minute&#39;, &#39;Duration of Change: Permanent&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, clicking now. Tell me when you start feeling kinky,&quot; Jesse clicked and a moment later a little window came up telling him that the change submission was successful and that the process was now beginning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I feel totally kinky,&quot; Nick chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m such a kinky freak that I&#39;m going strip naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was not unusual for Nick. Jesse knew that as boring as his friend could seem, he did have a sarcastic streak. But when Nick actually started to follow through Jesse&#39;s eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
Before his very eyes Nick pulled off his shirt, revealing a plain white cotton t-shirt. A moment later his jeans followed suit, revealing an equally plain set of boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Master Jesse? This is how kinky I am,&quot; Nick laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;m such a kinky and perverted little pet. The most kinky perverted pet that Master Jesse could ever wish for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what did you just call me?&quot; Jesse could hardly believe what he had heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Jesse,&quot; Nick blushed, &quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you? Am I being a bad pet? It spoke out of turn didn&#39;t it? Oh, it&#39;s such a bad pet. It doesn&#39;t deserve how nice Master Jesse is to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jesse watched the fabric of Nick&#39;s t-shirt and boxers began to change, at first darkening and then thickening until they were black leather, then the front of the shirt opened up, revealing that Nick had rings with little beads on them through his nipples. The shirt pulled back farther, the shoulders shrinking and the bottom of the shirt rose up until it was a harness with straps around his shoulders, and above, below and between his pecs, forcing them up and out in a way that had to be painful. Lower down his boxers were also changing, becoming a set of straps across his thighs, around his stomach, and between his legs, pressing down against his shaven crotch, probably painfully flattening his dick against him. The two sets of straps joined into a single unit, but the changes weren&#39;t over quite yet. The bead on the center of his nipple piercings grew larger until there were small weights pulling down on his nipples and for good measure a collar appeared around his neck, held shut by a heavy padlock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jesse gasped.<br />
<br />
In response Nick dropped to his knees and lowered his head, &quot;Your pet is so sorry Master Jesse. Your pet knows it shouldn&#39;t speak unless spoken to. Your pet will take its punishment like a good pet should. It&#39;s so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick turned around, presenting his round, firm backside to Jesse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening,&quot; Jesse stared down at his nearly naked friend on the floor, &quot;Nick, get up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick practically jumped to his feet, the heavy nipple piercings thudding against his pecs, which were held in place by the straps around them, barely even bouncing due to how tightly they were restrained, &quot;Should your pet get Master Jesse&#39;s whip so it may be punished? Is that what Master Jesse wants? To whip his bad pet across his ass and pecs until they are red?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not...&quot; Jesse trailed off, shaking, &quot;Nick, please stop this. I&#39;m not going to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Master Jesse,&quot; Nick sighed, actually sounding disappointed, &quot;Your pet is sorry it upset you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And stop that pet stuff too,&quot; he added quickly, &quot;This is too strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Nick laughed nervously, &quot;It&#39;s just what I like. I was hoping you&#39;d play along with me today. You&#39;re not too upset, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, well...no,&quot; Jesse stared at the computer, &quot;Don&#39;t you just think this is strange?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick looked down at himself and shrugged, &quot;I thought you were okay with me doing this around the house. If it upsets you too much I&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything strange about the way you&#39;re dressed, or acting?&quot; Jesse stammered, still not believing the sight before his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Nick smiled, giving one of his nipple piercings a tug, &quot;It&#39;s what I&#39;m into, you know? I mean we&#39;ve been renting this place for over three years now and I thought you&#39;d gotten used to it by now. Or was I taking things too far with the way I was today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, too far,&quot; Jesse said weakly, the significance of the last settings he had selected in the program. Nick had no clue about what had been done and everything had adjusted as though Nick had always been the way he was now. Jesse was the only one who was aware that there was anything out of the ordinary. Shaken, he looked at the computer screen and saw that it had gone back to the program&#39;s starting screen, &quot;I need a moment to think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Nick smiled wider, giving his bulge he had begun playing with a good squeeze, &quot;I hope I wasn&#39;t being demanding earlier. You know that&#39;s not me. It&#39;s just that I really enjoy the thought of getting whipped. You don&#39;t mind that I go to my room for a bit do you? I feel awful about having upset you and I really need to get it out of my system.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Jesse said weakly, not even watching as Nick walked out of the room. All his attention was on the computer. He had to change Nick back, but what then? He had a computer program that could change reality. He could make any changes he wanted to anyone and no one would ever know. What could he do with that sort of power? Did he even want it?<br />
<br />
He had no clue how long he spent lost in thought, but he soon became aware of strange sounds coming from down the hall, specifically they sounded like they were coming from Nick&#39;s room. It sounded like muffled gasps and sharp &#39;thwacks&#39; with the occasional whimper thrown in for good measure.<br />
<br />
Nervous, he got up and quietly went down the hall to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
The sight that greeted him was the biggest shock of the day.<br />
<br />
Nick had used a set of latches to attach his nipple rings to the posts of his bed, the straps pulled tight as he lay there, smacking his thighs with a riding crop, the straps attached to his nipple rings pulling sharply against his chest as he writhed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, ooh,&quot; Nick whimpered softly, hitting himself harder, &quot;Ouch! Hurts so good. Bad boy. Bad pet! Ooh! Ooh!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was obvious, despite his pain, that Nick was also experiencing a great deal of pleasure if the way he was bucking his hips was anything to go by. In fact Jesse was sure that he could see the strap across Nick&#39;s crotch swelling obscenely.<br />
<br />
Moments later, before his very eyes, Nick experienced a toe curling orgasm, a gush of cum flowing down around the strap between his legs.<br />
<br />
Shocked and frightened, Jesse wondered what to do.</p>
