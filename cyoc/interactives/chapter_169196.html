<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana looks intently at the stone statue&#39;s partly semen-covered cock with a slight lust that was slowly building up, she knew she had to pull away before the petrification began, but her mind had come across a worrying thought, what if the statue would come alive? A seemingly ridiculous thought but then again, the fact the statues were all once people also seemed ridiculous. Diana hesitated, her mind was still slightly conflicted between possibly just entering the temple and looking for alternative solutions or just risk the statue in front of her very face, in the hopes that she could pull away in time.<br />
<br />
Diana was still slightly worried on both options, what if the temple wouldn&#39;t be any easy for her to traverse alone? And what if she wouldn&#39;t be able to pull away from the statue in time or the statue came to life and prevented her from escaping it&#39;s stony grasp? She then turned around to look at the female statues, maybe she could try and drink their milk for an effect similar to the male statues cum? SHe pondered about that option as well, but she was still fearful that either statue gender would end up petrifying her anyway and add her to the temple&#39;s eternal exhibit as yet another eternal decoration and trap?<br />
<br />
SHe was torn between the 3 options, refusing an option where she simply left, she wanted the curves of the temples countless victims, she wanted the curves that she found herself envying to her very core. letting go of the presented opportunity to achieve the curves she sook so dearly was unthinkable now, she had finally achieved an opportunity, but that opportunity (or well, two opportunities) might very well make her yet another victim, and that prospect kept her conflicted. She gazed between the three opportunities, the male statues cock and consequently semen, possibly the milk of the female statues, and the possible alternatives she might find within the temple itself.<br />
<br />
She was torn, and also worried, worried that the easiest opportunities she had found would result in her demise anyway. But her determination and desire to fulfill the many rumours which had caused her to seek out the temple of lust pressed on, pushing her towards making a choice between the three, and after several moments, she chose to risk the male statue that had tempted her, but her mind was still worried, the lust within her growing more strong. Diana gazed back at the statues cock, the semen which had partially covered it had disappeared, leaving the erect member fully present, but still moist, as if to point towards some sort of lubricant already present. Diana gulped as she leaned forward slightly, raising her rear, lifting her right hand to firstly stroke the cock, but an ever present worry in her mind made her hesitate, her mouth was open and tongue poked out ever so slightly, her body shivered, not in coldness but in conflicting thoughts and worries.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;If you want curves that badly you shouldn&#39;t touch these statues.&#39;&#39; A sultry voice suddenly said from Diana&#39;s right, causing her to snap out of her short-lived daze, the lust building up inside of her mind disappearing, quickly looking to where the voice came from, Diana&#39;s gaze met two absolutely giant breasts with exposed, bloated nipples, the owner of those very breasts being a purple-haired girl with a cheeky smirk on her bloated lips painted purple, Diana couldn&#39;t help but stare as she also saw the womans crotch, two wide hips giving way to a massive pair of buttcheeks, extremely thick thighs giving way to thin legs and beautiful feet with purple nails resting on her toes, her hands had the same purple coloured nails resting on the slender female hands, the womans nipples even had a squiggly purple line circling them.<br />
<br />
Diana was dumbfounded as someone with curves one might see as utter madness had suddenly appeared and told her that the statues weren&#39;t safe to touch if she wanted curves. &#39;&#39;W-who are you?&#39;&#39; Diana asked. &#39;&#39;Nobody in particular, just a priestess of the temple granting words of guidance to a guest of the temple lusting for a deliciusly curvacious body.&#39;&#39; The woman answered, before grabbing Diana&#39;s raised hand. &#39;&#39;You should not let this momentary shock inhibit your capability to go onwards dear.&#39;&#39; She continued with a more, &#39;calming&#39; voice, her smirk becoming awider smile. Diana could feel her hands skin was silky smooth, their glistening surface making it look pristinely cared for, or maybe that&#39;s because of the temple? <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;The temple will be more than happy to fulfill your desire in whatever way it deems suitable, be it as a decoration for the halls or as another servant for the temple. Now come, fulfill your desire in whatever way you chose in accordance to the many opportunities the temple will present!&#39;&#39; The woman finished with glee in her eyes as she pulled Diana along with surprising strength. Diana decided to go along with it after she was slightly roughly pulled away from the viscinity of the male statue, noticing that the woman pulled her towards the temples entrance, which was now wide open, and as they walked through the open entrance, the door began closing, and Diana watched asthe heavy stone doors silently closed, noticing a female explorer standing outside the door, likely having just newly reached to top of the marbled stairs, her gaze and agape muth however let Diana know she had been ensnared by one of the male statues. And as that thought settled into realization, the doors came together and her ears settled into the silence of all but the steps of herself and...<br />
<br />
Diana&#39;s mind came over a discrepancy as she turned her head back towards the priestess, only to settle on a distant fountain of sorts, but the fountain had become unnoticable as Diana looked around for the ridiculously voluptious priestess, finding no other living being than herself present. Speaking of herself, Diana noticed her complete absence of clothes, as though all her clothing disappeared upon entering the temple. &#39;&#39;Is clothing discouraged in here?&#39;&#39; Diana thought as she looked down on her daint yet slightly athletic frame and at her measly A-cup breasts with small nipples standing ashamed atop the almost unnoticable mounds. It reminded her so painstakingly much of the first time she heard of the many rumours surrounding her body, she could so clearly remember the denial, and the painstakingly frustrating time that followed, that was just the beginning, and she had to deal with it. <br />
<br />
Diana let out a long sigh before looking around, the temple&#39;s first hall loked simple, of course there were more statues here similar to the ones outside, although it seemed more cramped in here, most of the male statues already had female victims clinging to their cocks, some pairs even had a second male shoving their dicks up the female vaginas, just like all the other male statues, these males were also seemingly stuck on the edge of orgasm. The hall was made of stone, marble presented the main decorative element with it being used in creating streaks or small patterns seperated by large clean-cut stone blocks, the statues were seperated into rows by stone pillars connected to the walls and stretching up into the arching stone roof. Diana noticed the complete absence of lighting inside the hall, yet everything was perfectly illuminated.<br />
<br />
As Diana loked over the statues, she could feel the envy inside her throb, she wanted those curves, she needed them, without them her life would eventually tear itself to pieces, she needed to live up to the rumours and expectations. And as her gaze came to one of the very few male statues absent of a partner she felt an unknown lust come, she noticed how it felt stronger than the lust she got from just being close to one of the statues outside, she noticed how the statue was the only one in it&#39;s row that did not have an ensnared female and second male. &#39;&#39;Lonely are you? Sorry, pretty sure you&#39;ll petrify me into your eternal partner if i comforted you. And that&#39;s not how i want to go down.&#39;&#39; Diana apolagized to the statue as she began walking down the corridor, the unknown lust disappearing as she looked away.<br />
<br />
Eventually she reached the fountain she had disregarded when she looked for the priestess, the fountain sat in the middle of a sizable, cylindrical chamber which had 4 paths that wasn&#39;t the entrance hall, along the walls f the chamber stood more statues, some having a partner and some not. The fountain was interesting, it was slightly large with 4 pedestals on it&#39;s north, south, west and east each with a petrified male quite roughly fucking a curvacius female, and out of that females agape mouth and erect nipples from aloft breasts streamed white liquid, presumably semen, the stream from their mouths flew onto the top of the fountains central spiral which then flowed down the spiral into the small lake, the streams from the breasts curved directly into the fountain-pond. Diana was curious whether consuming the semen from the fountain would do something to her, and she also wondered about how the females got caught in their position, were they ambushed by a statue that came to life? or maybe one of the temples beasts?<br />
<br />
But Diana didn&#39;t want to dwell on that matter for long as she walked around the fountain and looked between the 4 paths that left the cylindrical room, pondering which path she would take, she couldn&#39;t see any big difference between the 4 paths and all of them could very well lead to the same place so far Diana knew. But alternatively she could see if the fountain&#39;s semen did anything. </p>
