<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie had a plan. She would allow Jack to see Katie but it would be on her terms, neutral sight and she would be waiting for him. The last thing Kellie wanted was giving Jack and his demon friends access to the other timeline. After that though, things could get messy.<br />
<br />
A conversation with Merlin and Katie proved to be a tense situation. Merlin was worried his daughter may be in over her head, dealing with a demon ex along with three powerful witches could prove to be more than she could handle on her own. As a result, Merlin insisted he come along.<br />
<br />
Katie, shocked that her father not only existed but wanted to see her, was dumbstruck. Kellie had never talked of him and although she knew the history between the two (Kellie still trying to come to terms with her sexuality when she had an affair) never thought she would see him. As a result Katie now found Kellie, Claudia and Mika accompanying her to the other timeline while Mary Elise and Samantha worked on a possible way of stopping Lilith, Circe, and Baba Yaga. As Kellie now stood with her friends awaiting Katie&#39;s arrival she found herself pacing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to be okay,&quot; teen Katie asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie turned towards her friend, giving her a sad smile. &quot;I dont know,&quot; she sighed. &quot;This whole Jack thing has thrown me off. What if things go wrong? What if he tries to take Katie by force? What if he finds a way into the other timeline? What if they win?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t,&quot; Katie answered, hugging her friend tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Katie&#39;s right,&quot; Mary Elise added. &quot;We faced down Morgan LeFay. We can deal with Jack.&quot; Kellie smiled at her friends thanking the nine of then as she turned towards a clearing. A portal was opening now, revealing Katie and her friends. As she was about to answer she noticed a second portal open. As that faded Kellies eyes went wide in shock. &quot;Mom what are you doing here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn O&#39;Toole rubbed her eyes as she cradled the infant Morgan. &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Katie asked me to watch Morgan today. Unfortunately the poor dear became quite cranky when Katie left. I was trying to calm her down and the next thing I knew I was here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie silently cursed as she gazed at her adoptive granddaughter. Despite Morgan not even being a month old the child sensed her mother was in danger and wanted to help. Unfortunately her actions may have put not only herself but Marilyn in danger. &quot;Okay mom listen,&quot; Kellie said quickly. &quot;I need you to hide with Claudia and Mika. Stay out of sight and stay safe, things could be really dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn nodded as she, Claudia, Mika, and Kellies friends now hid from sight. They didn&#39;t want to be seen because of Kellies plan. The plan, which even Kellie thought was foolish, was to try and bind Jack&#39;s magic and reverse the spells that had transformed Rexie and Maaya. Letting out a sigh of relief as they now hid Kellie waited for Jack&#39;s arrival. Fortunately she didn&#39;t need to wait long.<br />
<br />
Jack slowly approached the clearing, his friends and family by his side. Kellie had expected this fortunately, she figured Jack would wish to show his strength when he arrived. As Kellie narrowed her eyes she saw a small grin spread across Jack&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kellie good to see you,&quot; he smirked. &quot;I see you brought Katie and your dad. Hope you dont mind me bringing my family with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much thought you would,&quot; Kellie huffed. &quot;So I lived up to my end of the bargain. This is your daughter Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack paused as he looked at the blond college woman and her honey haired fiancee. He had only seen pictures of Katie as a child but he immediately recognized the adult version of her. It was odd looking at this girl, Jack could see aspects of himself in his only child and even felt his heartache slightly. Despite being a torch bearer for the darkness Jack did care about his family, even a child he hadn&#39;t seen in almost 21 years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um hi Katie,&quot; he said sheepishly. &quot;I, I&#39;m really glad your mom talked you into meeting me.Im....I&#39;m sorry we haven&#39;t had a chance to meet before today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gazed curiously at this teenage boy that claimed to be her father. Growing up Katie had never had a father figure. She had had her mother and mostly Aunt Lisa raise her. The closest thing to a father figure she had was Jason. Jason had know her since she was 16 and eventually married Lisa. She loved Jason and trusted him but it wasn&#39;t the same as having a father. &quot;Hi, dad,&quot; she stammered. &quot;This...is kind of strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah know the feeling,&quot; Jack replied rubbing his neck. &quot;I..I do want to apologize for not being in your life. Just wanted to try and get to know you. Try to make up for lost time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why weren&#39;t you part of Katie&#39;s life,&quot; Kellie asked as she squeezed her fiancee&#39;s hand. &quot;I know my dad would go to hell and back to see me. Where were you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its complicated,&quot; Jack sighed. &quot;I...I wasn&#39;t the best person in my first life. I want to try and make it up to you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay dad,&quot; Katie stated. &quot;What so you propose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I start with hug?&quot; Katie glanced at her fiance nodding before looking at her father. She gave her father a slight nod as she extended her arms. Jack smiled, as he was about to step forward Lilith threw her arm out stopping the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Lilith said firmly. &quot;This is wrong.&quot; Nudging her son back she now angrily glared at Kellie and Merlin. &quot;Do you think me so foolish that I wouldn&#39;t sense the magic building behind you,&quot; she hissed. &quot;I can sense the others presence Merlin, and one other. Now tell them to come forward or I will end not only your daughter but the rest of these fools as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin and Kellie nervously looked at one another before staring at Lilith. The witch was angry, their plan had failed. They hadn&#39;t realized Lilith would be able to sense the presence of the others. Sighing in frustration they now motioned for the others to join them. The last thing they wanted to do was fight. &quot;Come out everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellies friends slowly emerged angrily glaring at Lilith and the others. Lilith just narrowed her eyes as she counted them all. &quot;Two of you are still hiding,&quot; she hissed. &quot;Now step forward or you all die, slowly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie curiously looked back, fear overcoming her as she realized Lilith was talking about Marilyn and Morgan. &quot;No leave them be,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;They&#39;re innocent in all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of you are inncent,&quot; Lilith growled. &quot;Now step forward!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie watched fearfully as Marilyn and baby Morgan now emerged from their hiding spot. Lilith smirked wickedly as she realized who the infant was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan,&quot; she laughed. &quot;My, my, my Morgan. Look where your arrogance has left you. A helpless newborn, cradled in the arms of an elderly woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith cackled as she pointed at the tiny infant girl, unaware of a tree branch breaking loose above her and crashing into her. Lilith collapsed to the ground, pushing the branch off her before smirking. &quot;Well perhaps not so helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dusting herself off she now stared at Kellie, Merlin, Katie and the others. &quot;This was your plan,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Destroy my son using your magic. Sad, you think that because of you defeated Morgan you can defeat me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Mary Elise growled. Lilith turned to face the Auburn haired teen, a vicious smile crossing her face. &quot;You,&quot; she growled. &quot;You would make an excellent addition to our side. You have so much darkness inside you girl. Merlin unbalanced the sides taking you as one of his. A mistake you can correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No chance,&quot; Mary spat. &quot;Wouldnt join you or your son for anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith could only sigh as she gazed at Mary Elise. &quot;Pity you have so much potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith waved her hand, knocking everyone but Marilyn and Morgan to the ground. As she stared at the group she smiled. &quot;I could take Morgan back without breaking a sweat,&quot; she laughed. &quot;I may do that eventually, for now though let her relive her life as a mortal child. I look forward to watching her relive the awkwardness of childhood and adolescence. For now though this meeting is concluded. Test me again and you will not be so fortunate.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lilith walked away with the others Kellie could only growl in frustration. Trying to stop Lilith would take a herculean effort, an effort that Kellie now worried they would not be up for.</p>
