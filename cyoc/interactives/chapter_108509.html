<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours earlier. Evan Lawson already in his dress uniform is shaking his daughter Spencer awake; having to wake up and be at work before revelry; Evan was hoping to talk to Spencer before he left.<br />
“Come on Spencer wake up,” Evan shaking his daughter.<br />
Spencer growls as she stirs, “I was having an enjoyable dream dad.”<br />
“Well you can go back to it in a bit,” Evan answering; “I just want to talk to you before I leave for work.”<br />
“About what;” Spencer yawning; using her paws to rub the sleep from her green feline like eyes.<br />
“About the were-panther gathering you’re attending tonight;” Evan answering.<br />
“What’s to talk about,” Spencer still yawning; “Eric and I are inducted, we chum around with Frieda for a bit, and then finally we spend the rest of the evening getting intimate and sleeping together.”<br />
Yes,” Evan rolling his eyes; &quot;that is the short version. But if the were-panther gatherings are anything like the pack meetings your mother and I attend, you will be asked by other were’s if you are interested in sex with them.”<br />
“I’m well aware,” Spencer sighing; “I’m also aware that no were can force themselves on another if they are not interested. Eric, I and Frieda are not interested in anyone but each other.”<br />
“Comforting as that may be,” Evan answering; “you and Eric will be the only unique were’s there. A hybrid such as yourself and a pure white fur were-panther such as Eric; it will be hard for everyone else to resist wanting to sample you both.”<br />
Spencer just flexes her claws and growls; “they’ll be sampling this if they try. Plus you taught me a few moves that will ensure everyone gets the message.”<br />
<br />
Evan smiles; glad that he had the forethought to teach his daughter how to defend herself, kisses Spencer still in her fursona. Getting up to leave, he turns around; “lock up before you head to school okay? Mike never came over.”<br />
“Where is grandpa dad,” Spencer asking.<br />
“Either at his new apartment or with his lady friend; ”Evan shrugging his shoulders. He leaves his daughter&#39;s room and walks to the front door heading to work.<br />
<br />
Spencer lying on her bed looks at the alarm clock; seeing its four thirty in the morning she sighs, “So much for getting back to that dream.”<br />
Getting up, Spencer grabs a bathrobe and heads to the bathroom. Deciding to start her day; Spencer de-furs and hops into the shower. Soaping herself all over with her unscented body wash; Spencer senses that Eric and Frieda are also up as well, both feeling confused and perturbed over being woken up early.<br />
“Wonder if they had the same dreams I did;” Spencer finishing up in shower.<br />
<br />
Getting out and toweling off; Spencer puts on her bathrobe and heads back to her room. Seeing her phone lit up with messages from both Eric and Frieda; Spencer replies, ‘Dad woke me up before leaving for work. Nothing major, just couldn’t go back to sleep. Had some fun dreams with the both of you; we’ll talk more at school.’<br />
Spencer sends the message to both and proceeds to getting dressed. Grabbing a pair of blue jeans and a pink shirt to wear; Spencer’s phone goes off again. Seeing the message is from Frieda reading; ‘Had fun dreams with you and Eric as well. When my dad wakes up, I’ll get him to pick you and Eric up for school. This will give us a chance to talk about those dreams.’<br />
Spencer puts her phone back down and continues getting dressed.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Frieda waking up in the same chair she sat in her mother’s recovery room; she sees both her mother and father in their fursona, both asleep. Sighing at being rudely woken from a dream she was enjoying; Frieda picks up that both Eric and Spencer are also awake. Getting up, Frieda uses the washroom; coming out minutes later she sees the bag containing the rest of her necessities that her father originally forgot. Seeing Benton also included several other articles of clothes; all from awareness, Frieda grins. Quickly sending a message to both Eric and Spencer; Frieda heads back to the washroom to use the small shower stall.<br />
<br />
After finishing up in the shower and getting dressed; Frieda comes out to see Spencer left her a message.<br />
‘Dad woke me up before leaving for work. Nothing major, just couldn’t go back to sleep. Had some fun dreams with the both of you; we’ll talk more at school.’<br />
Frieda smiles and composes a reply.<br />
‘Had fun dreams with you and Eric as well. When my dad wakes up, I’ll get him to pick you and Eric up for school. This will give us a chance to talk about those dreams.’<br />
Hitting send, Frieda goes back to getting dressed. Despite that the bra and panties that her father got were a plain white affair; they were from Awareness. Also putting on a shirt and skirt from awareness; Frieda shifts into her fursona. Reveling in the feel of the fabric stretching as her body shifts and bulks up in her were-panther fursona; noticing  her feline tail pushing through the hidden seam in her skirt, Frieda purrs as she takes her phone into her paw and amuses herself with a game or two, waiting for her parents to stir.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Eric wakes up not knowing why; the dream he had with Spencer and Frieda was pleasant. Growling at being denied more fun thanks to his subconscious; he soon feels both Spencer and Frieda are also awake.<br />
“Did we have the same dream?” Eric mumbles as he sees the clock on his phone reading four thirty. Sitting on the edge of his bed he fires off a quick text message to both Spencer and Frieda. Despite it still dark outside; Eric is able to see perfectly thanks to his enhanced visions as a were-panther. Able to see clearly he deftly gets up to the bathroom; not even bothering to turn on any lights he hops into the shower.<br />
<br />
Minutes later Eric is back in his bedroom. Naked and no longer in his fursona he looks at his reflection in his mirror. He sees the muscles on his arms more noticeably defined as well as his abs looking more chiseled. Clearly seeing a six pack present; Eric grins as his eyes trail down to his manhood. His penis and testicles; pleased at the increase size after becoming a were, Eric quickly puts on a pair of underwear. Turning around to see a message from both Spencer and Frieda flashing on his phone.<br />
<br />
‘Dad woke me up before leaving for work. Nothing major, just couldn’t go back to sleep. Had some fun dreams with the both of you; we’ll talk more at school.’<br />
Eric chuckles as he finished reading Spencer’s message. Turning to Frieda’s he grins even more.<br />
‘Had fun dreams with you and Eric as well. When my dad wakes up, I’ll get him to pick you and Eric up for school. This will give us a chance to talk about those dreams.’<br />
<br />
Eric puts down his phone; despite it being early, Eric was excited for the chance to be with both Spencer and Frieda. Knowing that they will have some alone time after his and Spencer’s induction ceremony; Eric quickly finishes getting dressed. Eager for the day to begin; Eric grabs his overnight bag and places it at the front door as he half walks half skips to the kitchen to get something for breakfast.</p>
