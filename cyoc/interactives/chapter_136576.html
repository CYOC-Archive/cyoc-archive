<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You tell Kevin to look for the key and leave. He needs to find a car and wait for you, if you don&#39;t come out it&#39;s probably too late and he should leave without you. Kevin is panicked &quot;I don&#39;t know how to drive a car, but, I&#39;ll find one!&quot; Kevin goes back to looking at the shelves as you exit the room.<br />
<br />
Going back into the main hall of the Library you see an Irishmen a few feet away from you. He&#39;s approaching the door, grinning &quot;Oh look, the fooker came out willingly.&quot; He&#39;s bald with a bushy orange beard. Your eyes are drawn to his chest which is hairy, muscular, and tattooed. His dick raises to full erection quickly after he spots you.<br />
<br />
You raise your fists and prepare to fight, the man seems surprised by this &quot;Oi, you daft? You planning to fight me?&quot; You stay there in that position and wait, he starts laughing &quot;Finally found a non-Irish bloke that&#39;s got balls. Stay right there alright?&quot; He pulls out a phone and starts calling someone, as he does he moves closer to you, you shift to avoid him. As you do, you just realized your mistake, he begins talking on the phone, and he has just now placed himself in front of the back door. &quot;Oi, Faolan. There&#39;s a lad who&#39;s looking for a fight. Yeah, looks like a real wimp, but he&#39;s all yours if you get here in time.&quot; The Irishman hangs up the phone and rests on the door, he begins idly masturbating as he stares at you, with a dirty smirk. He points to a tattoo above his crotch that reads &#39;free drinks&#39; and asks &quot;Want a drink from Shane?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head and he just laughs. You start formulating a plan to escape but as you do you hear Shane get another phone call. He goes off towards the doors, as he does you start to sneak to the back room. But you are too slow as another Irishman has entered the room.<br />
<br />
The new man is around 6&#39;10 and huge. His build is like a wrestler, in fact, he probably is some sort of wrestler. His hair is long and wild, his beard a short well-defined goatee, connecting between his upper lip and chin. He looks at you and grins, going into a fighting stance &quot;Alright, you&#39;ll entertain me for a bit.&quot; With that said he rushes you, you dodge out of his punches and hit him in return. You hit his stomach, but he doesn&#39;t seem affected at all by your blow. In return, he punches your gut and you go reeling backwards.<br />
<br />
You pant as he walks up to you with a grin &quot;you&#39;ll turn out alright.&quot; He roughly grabs you and brings you close to his chest in a bear hug. Your body hurts as you&#39;re forced against him, but as you&#39;re there he starts moving your body with purpose. Your mouth ends up next to his pecs, you can feel his hair tickling your face. The smell of his musky, mainly body starts to intoxicate you, you rub your crotch against his leg as your mouth begins to lick at his abs. You here a hearty laugh above you as you&#39;re let go. You feel his body, your arms stretch to his back, it feels muscular and defined, hairs coating it. As you feel his back you continue to play with his abs, eventually moving to his nipple. Sweat enters your mouth as your clean off Faolan, the sweat is salty, but it feels good entering your mouth.<br />
<br />
You focus on pleasuring his nipples and thrusting across his leg, the intense pleasure is quickly too much for you, and you end up shooting ropes of cum. Faolan&#39;s dick is rock hard and at attention, but you are too busy loving his chest to move to it. You hear Faolan call out &quot;Oi, Shane. Help me out here.&quot; Within a short while, you see Shane has started to jerk off Faolan. You continue like this until Faolan moves. You feel a hand grab the back of your head as Faolan raises his arm and pushes your head into his armpit. You can taste and feel his sweat in an instant, the scent is too much and you begin moaning again in a second, dry orgasm. Faolan laughs as he holds you there, you begin sniffing and licking his pits with glee.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you feel hands on your body, coating you in something sticky. You offer no resistance as your entire body is coated in this substance, eventually, Faolan frees you from his armpit, and you see Shane gathering Faolans cum and spreading it onto your face. Your body starts to tingle as a wave of orange hairs sprout from your body. You tense as you see your muscles define, in fact, your muscles are familiar. You grow in size to 6&#39;7 and see that your build is the same as Faolans. You walk to a mirror and see that it&#39;s not just your build, your hair is similar, just about half the length, and you&#39;re sporting the same beard. Your cock is a bit thicker than his, but he does have you easily beaten in length by 2 inches. <br />
<br />
Faolan grabs you and roughly kisses you &quot;So Felan, you ready to get back to training?&quot; You nod your head, you&#39;re ready for anything that involves getting sweaty with Faolan.<br />
<br />
After sacrificing yourself to save a friend, you decided to fight the professional wrestler Faolan. Standing no chance, you were quickly defeated and made to worship his body. As his cum was spread on you, you ended up changing into his wrestling partner, Felan. While still weaker then Faolan, you fight as a team and are often made to fight Faolan for practice. You fight well with Faolan but always lose to him in practice, and after each loss comes your favorite event as you drink his sweat, then take his dick...</p>
