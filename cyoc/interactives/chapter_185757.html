<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mathew walked across and examined himself in the full length mirror that was the door to the wardrobe. One look at his reflection and there was no doubt he had Kim’s lower half. His legs no longer looked anything like his own. They were girl legs, shapely girl legs. His thighs were a girl’s thighs. His hips were widened and his bum was fat. And most importantly there was nothing dangling from his crotch. All he had was the little blonde landing strip that Kim trimmed her pubes to. <br />
<br />
Curious Matthew bent over and pinched his leg. It hurt. It felt like he was pinching his own skin. The skin didn’t come away with his touch like a sock or pantyhose might. <br />
<br />
Tentatively he bought his hand up to his groin and explored what was under that little patch of blonde hair. It wasn’t just a rubber costume. It was real. He had and orifice. He tentatively explored between the flaps of skin. He was pink inside….. and moist ….. and sensitive. He had a pussy!<br />
<br />
Matthew came to the realisation that Kim had somehow turned herself into a skin suit. A suit that changed the wearer to become – Kim. How it worked he had no idea but it was real. Of that there was no doubt.<br />
<br />
The next thing that came into Matthew’s mind was the need of self-preservation. Was this reversible? He tugged at the top of the costume, Kim’s torso, head and hair, which were dangling from his waist. He pulled it outwards away from his body to see if he could see inside. He wanted to check that his penis was still there!<br />
<br />
It hurt. It was as if Kim’s skin had glued itself to his lower body! But then he got that pins and needles feeling once more and slowly the skin suit pulled off He rolled it down. 1st an inch then another he quickly learnt that he had to put pressure on the ‘joint’ if you could call the area where his and Kim’s skin merged, wait for the pins and needles to come then subside. Only then could he push the skinsuit down another inch. An inch a minute was as fast as Matthew could ‘undress’<br />
<br />
It took 5 minutes for a sense of relief to come to Matthew. That was when he was able to prize Kim low enough to release his penis. It was still there! It sprung out at full erection, Matthew wasn’t sure whether his excitement was due to relief or the fact that he had just experienced having a pussy. <br />
<br />
He spent a couple more minutes rolling the skin suit down further until he could once more examine Kim’s crotch. No longer in contact with Matthews body it was once more just a layer of rubbery material with some blonde hairs apparently growing from it. There was no sign of the pink orifice or the moisture he had so recently experienced.<br />
<br />
Still with female legs up to his thighs, but no longer the padded bum, Matthew once more sat on the bed and contemplated what to do. He now knew the process was reversible. He now knew he could fulfil Kim’s wish and wear her but then at the end of the day he could take her off and be himself once more.<br />
<br />
He really did want to fulfil Kim’s wishes. He had promised he would. At the time he didn’t know what he was promising to do but all the same he had. He could remember saying “Cross my heart and hope to die”<br />
<br />
One aspect he didn’t like though about fulfilling Kim’s wishes was the prospect of taking her off. It was a slow painful process. If he started now then in maybe 30 minutes he could get the remains of the suit off his legs. Were he on the other hand to wear her completely it might take hours to undress once he had completed her wish. Judging by his recent experience it would be a long painful process.<br />
<br />
He though of the pro’s and the cons. Firstly the pro’s for wearing Kim.<br />
1.	He had promised he would.<br />
2.	It was clearly her wish<br />
3.	The idea of essentially becoming Kim was sexually thrilling<br />
4.	If he didn’t fulfil her wish maybe she wouldn’t fulfil his. He had spent a lot of money on this holiday. If he became a dress as he planned and she just put him in a wardrobe and left him there for the duration of his transformation then he would be pissed off.<br />
5.	The receptionist had suggested he should and that he should make the most of his 24 hours with a special suit. She was probably in a position to know.<br />
6.	…… He couldn’t immediately think of anything else<br />
Now for the con’s<br />
1.	It would be a long painful process to take her off again. But then he had close to 2 days.<br />
2.	The receptionist had said he should enjoy the resorts amenities. How could he do that in a female body?<br />
3.	How could he walk around the resort in a female body?<br />
<br />
He came to the conclusion he needed to add another pro. Number 6 pro became: It would be cowardly not to. Kim would never forgive him. And actually the more he thought about it the con’s 2 and 3 could actually be pro’s as well. His still erect penis said so. Matthew wondered if he had just unveiled a secret cross dressing fetish that he never previously knew he had.</p>
