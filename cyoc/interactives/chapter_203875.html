<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd didn’t know how to answer.  She didn’t even know if her answer mattered.  <br />
<br />
She opened her mouth, but all that came out was a high-pitched moan as heat flooded her body.  Her breasts felt so tight and sensitive.  Her pussy felt so warm and damp, she could feel the muscles inside grinding against themselves, trying to milk a phantom cock but succeeding only in drawing her own wetness deeper inside.<br />
<br />
One of her hands was massaging an erect nipple, the other was rubbing the ring pierced through her clit.  Her wrist tiled down, as her pinky brushed over her new hole while firm muscles tried their hardest to suck it inside.<br />
<br />
Todd looked up and saw Alexandros standing over her.  She wanted nothing more than for his mouth to wrap itself around her tits, for it to suck down, for his cock to press up against her, for it to fill her needy holes.  All she could think about was how good it would feel to for him to force her up against the wall, for him to bite down on the back of her neck, to feel her ears pressing up against his chin as he towered over her.<br />
<br />
Alexandros stared down at the bunny girl, desperately trying to masturbate at his feet.<br />
<br />
“Summer seems to be your lucky season, little girl,” he said with a wink.<br />
<br />
Alexandros looked over at the lizardman and said, “Lazar, our new friend seems a bit needy, why don’t you help her out?”<br />
<br />
Todd looked back at Lazar just in time to a smooth, green cock press out of his vent as it pushed his loincloth aside.  As she looked down the shaft, Todd saw a bit of pre already oozing out of its tapered tip.  All the while, a thick tongue slinked out of Lazar’s mouth and ran over his lips, leaving a slight trail of spit behind it.  It didn’t take Todd long to figure out what exactly Lazar was planning on having for dinner.<br />
<br />
“No…” Todd whispered.  Her body had shrunk so much that Lazar was easily twice her new size, with a cock that could easily fill her entire belly.  All she could think of what how big it was, how there was no way she could take it, how he would split her in two if she tried.<br />
<br />
Todd had to get away.  She had to escape.  She knew she had to get up and run out the door.  But she couldn’t stop rubbing herself.  Her pussy was swollen.  Ser nipples were like tightly wound strings, vibrating back and forth as she her fingers strum them.  <br />
<br />
She had to get away.  But she couldn’t stop, couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything but try to relieve herself as Lazar inched closer and closer.<br />
<br />
Todd tried to slink away, but Lazar just leaned over and pressed a strong, reptilian hand under her back, easily hefting her body into the air.  <br />
<br />
Alexandros saw where the two were headed and pulled his box of goodies off of the table in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Todd’s body was tossed roughly into the table, her rock-hard nipples being squished against cold wood.  Pleasure radiated through her body.  As much as Todd wanted to get away, her body wanted to be ravaged.  It wanted her breasts to be squished against the table as the massive weight bore down on her back.  It wanted his cock to be buried deep inside her.  It wanted her womb filled with his seed.  It wanted release.  Release from the heat.  Release from the need.<br />
<br />
Lazar reached around the side of Todd’s chest, his hands gently massaging her breasts while sharp claws carefully ran through delicate fur.  Todd realized that he could rip her to shreds, but his care in handling her delicate body just made her even hotter.<br />
<br />
Todd looked back at Alexandros, tears welling up in her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Please…” but she was cut short when she felt Lazar pull back on her chest, causing her to slide towards him as his cock sunk into her wet pussy.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s eyes went wide.  Drool leaked out of her gaping mouth.  Her legs spread apart.  Her tail pressed up against her back.  She felt Lazar going deeper inside of her.  He was so thick, so big.  She felt her insides stretch as he pushed past her hips and into her stomach.  Her muscles clenched and squirmed as they sucked down, trying to pull him even further inside, trying to caress him, to milk him.  She needed him inside of her.  She needed more.<br />
<br />
She felt his cock press up against the top of her stomach as it reached her end, as it filled every last bit of her space.  Then he began to rock her back and forth, the sides of his cock massaging her inner walls as her breasts rubbed against the table.  <br />
<br />
Pleasure shot through every inch of her body.  It flowed out of her clit, out of her pussy.  It ran through her stomach, ran through her breasts.  It flooded into her nipples, flooded into her head.  It felt so good, it felt so perfect.  But it wasn’t enough.  She was so close to cumming, so close to release.  But she had hit a plateau.  No matter what he did she just couldn’t quite get there, couldn’t quite satisfy her need.<br />
<br />
Her hips gyrated.  Her muscles clenched down as hard as they could.  They sucked and tugged and pulled.  They ran over his cock – squirming, begging as they tried to find their grip.  She could picture the cum, just sitting there in his balls, just waiting to fill her womb.  She needed it.  She needed it in her.  She needed to get it out of him.  She needed to do anything and everything that she could – all so that she could experience the feeling of his gritty, reptilian cum flooding her delicate rabbit insides.<br />
<br />
She was so close.  She was almost there.  Just a little bit more.<br />
<br />
Warmth filled her womb, it overflowed out and down her vagina, it oozed out of hole, soaking into her surrounding fur.  It felt so good.  It felt so right.  But it wasn’t enough.<br />
<br />
Lazar began to pull out.<br />
<br />
“No!”  Todd screamed, “don’t stop!  I need to cum!  I need more!”<br />
<br />
But it was a futile plea as Lazar pushed her away, his cock slipping free of her vagina.<br />
<br />
She felt the glow begin to recede, being replaced by the same heat, the same need from before.<br />
<br />
She brought a hand down to her clit and began stroking it.  It felt good, but it wasn’t enough.  She brought her other hand down, cum sticking to her fingers as she desperately stuck them inside of herself.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t enough.  Nothing was enough.  She could bring herself to the brink, but she couldn’t cum, she couldn’t release.  And the more she tried, the hotter her body grew. The more her body needed it.  The more SHE needed it.<br />
<br />
It was the ring, Todd realized, she needed to get rid of the ring.  She gripped it in her fingers, desperately searching for a clasp, for a ball she could remove, for anything.  But all she felt was warm, solid steel.<br />
<br />
She looked up at Alexandros with eyes begging for release.  She hoped to see compassion.  She hoped to see mercy.  But that wasn’t what she saw.  <br />
<br />
Staring back were two large horns and a stone cold face, completely devoid of any sympathy for her current plight.<br />
<br />
“I told you,” he said, “some of these are quite permanent.”<br />
<br />
Panting with need, Todd managed to meek out the beginnings of a question, “Why can’t?”<br />
<br />
“You cum?”  Alexandros interrupted her, “do I really need to repeat myself?”<br />
<br />
“I suppose I should start by telling you the name of that ring,” he continued, “the small band of metal that has permanently affixed itself to your clitoris is known as the Ring of the Fuckbunny.  I’m sure that the name of the ring tells you more than enough about what you’re going to be spending the rest of your life as.”<br />
<br />
“Your newfound heat and inability to cum are… well, I like to think of them as features of your new body.  You’re free to disagree, it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Unless you happen to be friends with a genie, there&#39;s nothing you&#39;ll ever be able to to about it.”<br />
<br />
“Please…” Todd began to stammer, “No… you can’t…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, but Todd, I already have, haven’t I?  And besides, you chose this Todd, you could have put on the collar.  You could have joined my playroom as a cute wolf girl.  But you threw that opportunity away, don&#39;t you remember?” mocked Alexandros, “In any event, if I were you, I would be thankful that isn’t the Ring of the Easter Bunny nestled into your crotch.  Like I said, its hard to tell the two apart, so you really did luck out.  If you’d ended up with the alternative, well…”  Alexandros trailed off.<br />
<br />
He watched the small bunny girl at his feet, both of her hands jammed into her crotch while she desperately tried to masturbate as cum slowly leaked out into a puddle below her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Alexandros thought to himself, “she might be a little much for my playthings.”<br />
<br />
“Lazar,” Alexandros said in a firm voice, “does your barracks have any source of entertainment?”<br />
<br />
Lazar shook his head as his tongue once again ran along his lips.  “Not like her we don’t.”<br />
<br />
“Perfect!” Alexandros exclaimed, “Then she’s all yours!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m sure she’ll make an excellent toy for you and your boys.”</p>
