<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You got a minute?&quot; John asked. He stopped Frank before he had left the cafeteria. The large police officer turned around. &quot;It&#39;s just I wanted to ask you something.&quot; It was a lie, but he was trying to figure out how to get Frank to stay. John wanted to try something out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; Frank said. He lifted his arm up and rubbed the back of his neck a little uncomfortably. &quot;There shouldn&#39;t be too much goin on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at this school,&quot; John laughed. He turned back to his computer and typed in that none of the students would be causing problems for the next few minutes. &quot;With a guard like you, why would anyone want to cross you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank took a seat across the table from John and leaned back in the cheap plastic chair. &quot;Guess your right,&quot; he laughed with him. Donnie laid down next to his feet. &quot;Especially with a good dog like Donnie,&quot; his big hand ruffled through Donnie&#39;s fur. &quot;But still can&#39;t be caught sitting around too much. Principal Mathews doesn&#39;t like that all that much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I know,&quot; John agreed. &quot;I just wanted to talk...&quot; he paused trying to think about what he could get Frank to talk about, &quot;working out.&quot; Again it was a lie but he just wanted to get Frank to stay. Right now he really wanted to test the limits of this device. If it was able to make someone into an animal and no one notice what else could it do? As soon as he saw Frank walking out of the bathroom he thought of the Minotaur. Frank&#39;s already large imposing body protected the halls, but what if he was even bigger?<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to tell you how to workout?&quot; Frank laughed. &quot;Your the gym coach man. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got any words of advice you probably hadn&#39;t heard before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I know,&quot; John said.  However, he kept typing into his phone. &#39;When Frank accepted the job, he was voluntarily turned into a Minotaur. No one finds this to be weird.&#39; John hit enter and his attention turned back to the man in front of him. He could already see the dark brown hair growing out of his forearms and his goatee grow a bit more wild. It covered his skin in a dense furry pelt. &quot;Just thought I&#39;d ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Frank&#39;s hands reached up and he scratched at his now beard. It hung lower on his face. His fingers started to merge together into two fingers and a thumb. The nails turned black and thickened into denser harder material closer to hoofs than human nails. &quot;Guess it&#39;s just hard work,&quot; he shrugged. The baritone in his voice had gone even deeper as he said it. <br />
<br />
John watched as more and more muscle added onto his already large frame. His 250 pound body had quickly gained another 50 pounds and didn&#39;t show any signs of stopping. The 20 inch arms that he&#39;d obviously been so proud of grew even thicker. Dense biceps and triceps worked together to give it a large round shape, while his forearms grew to make him look even more intimidating. His pecs pushed at the navy blue shirt across his chest, popping the top couple of buttons. His shoulders had already made short work of his sleeves as they grew even more like bowling balls. Frank rotated his neck trying to ease some of the discomfort from the rapid growth.<br />
<br />
The police officer stood up and stretched towards the sky. &quot;I&#39;m feelin really tight all of a sudden,&quot; he grunted as his hands nearly brushed up against the ceiling. His clothes burst off his body showing his naked bullish form. John hadn&#39;t realized just how much the other man would grow. He thought being 6&#39;5&quot; was pretty tall but now Frank was passing 9 feet. Even though his body was significantly longer, it was as thick as it had ever been. His size made it impossible for shirts to fit across his frame.<br />
<br />
And his legs couldn&#39;t fit into any kind of pants either. Huge, thick, and defined; there was no way he could wear anything other than the large loin cloth that had to go down to his knees, lest the tip of his dick ever make an appearance to unsuspecting students. His feet had already shifted to the massive hooves to hold up his astounding weight. He easily looked like he could have weighed over a ton. He stretched his body again groaning as even more weight added to his frame. &quot;Sorry bout that buddy,&quot; he apologized for the loud noise. &quot;Sometimes I forget my own size... But I guess it&#39;s just a lot of it comes to that contract I signed with the school. Turning into a Minotaur wasn&#39;t all bad.&quot; He grinned and flexed his unbelievably large bicep. His arm was well over 40 inches. <br />
<br />
His deep voice reverberated off the hard floor and walls. The rest of the class didn&#39;t pay attention to it as they were still studying. John just stared up in disbelief. &quot;Yeah... Guess that helped,&quot; he let out a light laugh. &quot;Glad it&#39;s workin for ya.&quot; <br />
<br />
Two leather strapped appeared across the bull&#39;s chest. One with his police badge while the other held the giant battle ax strapped to his back. Even if he wasn&#39;t ever allowed to use it, it still appeared on his back. &quot;Yep,&quot; he grinned. His nose had pressed out into a bull&#39;s face. Two large horns stuck out on the sides of his head while his ears flopped down to the side. &quot;But I&#39;ve got to get back to work. Nice talkin to ya,&quot; he grinned. &quot;C&#39;mon Donnie.&quot; The German Shepard that had been next to his feet had over doubled in size. Even on all fours he stood at a good 5&#39;8&quot;. He easily outweighed many of the students.<br />
<br />
John watched as Frank left the cafeteria. The Minotaur had to duck underneath the door to make his way out. All John could wonder if there was anyone stupid enough to actually mess with Frank anymore. But more importantly what else he could change.</p>
