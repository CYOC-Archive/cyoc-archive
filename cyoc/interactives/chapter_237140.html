<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hidden deep within a forest lay a cabin. On the outside, it looked abandoned. Moss coated the roof and part of the chimney. Most shutters on the building were closed except for one that would bang against the wall whenever a strong wind came. The path to the cabin was overgrown and broken. Finally, the door looked like a good push would send it falling. However, that&#39;s what the witch wanted it to look like.  <br />
<br />
Fay was the last witch of her coven. The others died off decades ago. However, She had found a spell that could grant immortality. The only catch was that it required the affected person to change something about themselves every time. Last time she expanded her breasts and butt to appeal to modern men. Only she overdid it. As a result, she now had back pain and a booty that made it hard to sit comfortably.  <br />
<br />
This time she would rectify the problem. She opened the ancient book carefully and flipped to the spell. &quot;spell of change&quot; she cackled. She then began to use her magic to send the ingredients to the cauldron. Her familiar Nevermore flew from his perch as she began to chant. &quot;Lichen from the mouth of a cavern. Water from a flowing stream. The frond of Fern. A banshee&#39;s scream&quot; Nevermore cawed in annoyance when the scram pierced the cabin. &quot;hush you fool&quot; Fay continued. A stone of clarity&quot; She hoped this stone was purer than the last one. &quot;blood of a live innocent&quot; she smiled as this was so easy to get now that blood drives were a thing. &quot;bones of dexterity&quot; all the bones of a hand went in the cauldron. &quot;a guilty man&#39;s punishment&quot; a noose was the last item to enter the cauldron. &quot;now forces of nature! Heed my call!&quot;  she ignored the spooked raven as he flew across the room. &quot;give me adventure! Change my body once and for all!&quot; she cackled once more as she felt the magic begin to enter her.  <br />
<br />
It was going well until Nevermore hit the chimney and plummeted right into the cauldron. Fay gasped as the magic became unstable. &quot;no!&quot; she cried out as she tried to distance herself from the cauldron. An explosion of magic came out of the boiling liquid. It broke every window and made the door fly into the yard. Enchanted smoke rose from the chimney as Fay ran out of the cabin, falling over the broken door. &#39;that stupid raven&#39; she thought as she gasped for air.  <br />
<br />
Because of its addition, her spell had become unstable at its highest power. She then felt her hands shift across the ground. Her blurry eyes began to clear and she was horrified by what she saw next. Her nails had become long black talons as the skin surrounding them started getting covered in black scales. As the scales spread up her arms she began to stand up, only for her shoes to break apart because of the large raven&#39;s feet. She fell backward as the scales began to run inside her sleeves and pants legs. She let out a yelp as long tail feathers raised her cloak. She struggled to stand as black feathers began sprouting across her skin.  <br />
<br />
She raised her changed hand to her destroyed cabin. Green magic surrounded it like the smoke ahead of her. &quot;vanish dangerous smoke. Head the words that I have *caw*&quot; she covered her mouth at the unintended noise. She put a hand to her neck and found an odd bulge there. Her other hand was pushed away by a large black beak. She tried to speak the words to stop the smoke but found only caws came from her new beak. Beneath her cloak her hair vanished. &#39;is this it?&#39; she thought. She soon let out a series of painful caws as two bulges began to tear through her cloak and shirt. Her entire torso felt too large for her clothes for some reason except for her breasts. She had no choice but to remove them with force. She used her new talons to rip apart her shirt and clock. She was shocked to see the slight v shape of her feathery torso and lack of breasts. Instead, firm pectorals were over a row of abs.  <br />
<br />
She soon came to the awful conclusion that she had merged with her familiar Nevermore. Her fears were confirmed as her ass shrank causing her pants to fall. A slit was seen between manly legs. She gapes as a cock came from it. It looked like a spire against a forest of black trees. He could feel his balls rest inside him and begin to pump testosterone into his system. Fare grabbed his new cock and jacked off. he had pleasured many men over his life but this was amazing. He let out a caw as he sent ropes of cum across the ground. He opened his amber eyes and saw the smoke had cleared from his home.  <br />
<br />
He slowly rose and took a step then another. Now that his body was done changing he could use it properly again. Fare was distraught at the state of his workshop. Potions were broken, ingredients ruined, and worst of all was the book he had used. It was nothing but a few scraps of paper and leather. He could not return to his old body without the ingredients and how to put them in. The hardest one to find would be the banshee scream. &quot;I hope there is still a copy of the book somewhere&quot; his voice was deep and manly. Sighing he wished he knew a spell to repair books but he always thought it was frivolous. Fare then raised his hands again. &quot;undo the damage from the boom. Fix this room&quot; Green magic left his hands and got busy restoring the room. The shattered items floated into the trash as the windows gained new panes of glass. The door floated back to the door frame and mended back together.  <br />
<br />
Once that was done he opened it and raised his hand. &quot;no longer shall I expose. Reform for my new clothes&quot; With that his outfit reformed. His pants resized and he gained a belt. His shirt and clock however reformed into a new variation for his altered form. He grinned with his eyes as his beak could not. Grabbing them he went to his mirror. Soon he was dressed and was surprised at how good he looked. His familiar always liked looking at himself and so did he. &#39;maybe an illusion instead of a change this time&#39; he chuckled. Glancing at his wings he wondered if he could fly like Nevermore.  <br />
<br />
Once outside he decided to try it. After getting a running start he flapped his wings. Once his feet left the ground he cawed in excitement. This was even better than his broom. He did several aerial movements that Nevermore knew. Suddenly he heard thunder off in the distance. Looking at the storm he gasped. Amidst the black cloud, a rainbow of colors faded in and out. Fare soon realized this was pure uncontrolled magic unleashed from his spell. While he had merely merged with his pet there was no telling what the storm would cause. Rain soon poured from it. Despite its massive size, it didn&#39;t last long and the cloud dissipated immediately afterward. A beastly howl could be heard. Curiosity getting the better of him he flew off in its direction. He soon landed outside a campsite. The ground was oddly dry after the storm. paeking his head from around a tree he saw a male werewolf and a female anthro hyena. He averted his gaze as this was not one of his spells. he decided to let the two be and flew back to his cabin. &#39;this is going to be more attention than I want&#39;. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Reports of strange transformations have been reported all across Oregon, these range from odd urges to actual monsters. There are even reports of these instances beginning to appear in neighboring states. The cause of this seems to be a storm that randomly shows up and lets out a torrential downpour for a short while then vanishes. Further...&quot; a TV news report said. However, the party goers didn&#39;t notice, as the TV was muted. Wendy stopped what she was doing and turned it off, as it wasn&#39;t even being used.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Wendy you got the chips yet?&quot; Gwen asked. The redhead peaked into the house. &quot;yeah Owen forgot to turn off the TV&quot; Wendy then grabbed the chips off the coffee table and ran to the backyard. Alice thanked her and poured them into the bowl. Bella then smacked Owen&#39;s head. &quot;I told you to stop eating the chips, they are for everyone,&quot; she said. &quot;sorry sis&quot; was all Owen said before his friends called him over to a small football game. &quot;so remind me why you invited your brother and his friend again?&quot; Joy asked. Bella shrugged &quot;he needs more friends besides his football buddies&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Owen throws the football at Brent while Tyler tries to intercept it. Cody pushed up his glasses and ate some chips. He walked over to Wendy and said &quot;Thanks for getting the chips&quot;. Wendy blushed &quot;It&#39;s no problem&quot;. The two talked about school until the football hit Cody&#39;s plate. &quot;sorry dude&quot; Brent said. Just as Cody was about to retort rain suddenly hit them. &quot;ah my hair!&quot; Gwen yelled as she ran inside. The others followed suit. However, once they were inside Wendy noticed the rain was gone. Even stranger was the fact that nothing was wet anymore, not even them. &quot;okay there is no way that happened&quot; Bella said. &quot;but it did rain didn&#39;t it?&quot; Tyler asked. &quot;what was in those chips&quot; Cody asked. Suddenly their phones just got an alert. Pulling it out Joy read aloud. &quot;warning. The sudden storm was detected. Remain inside until the storm passes. DO NOT GET WET&quot; she gulped as the last four words were capitalized and bold. The nine people all looked at each other before...</p>
