<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The interior of the Cabin was a warm respite from the cold of the outdoors. Jess shook with the cold as she closed the front door behind her. James had stepped in first and was now fighting to take his boots off. With a grunt and a *pop* the boot came loose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh....! That&#39;s better&quot;, he moaned in relief. He turned to smile at his sister. &quot;I&#39;m glad you called a halt to that pointless trudging around. I didn&#39;t want to admit it to Dad, but I&#39;m wrecked tired too.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jess rolled her eyes and made an exaggerated sigh, &quot;Jesus James! Then why didn&#39;t you say anything either?&quot;.<br />
<br />
He shrugged. A moment&#39;s silence descended, the question gnawing on her mind surfaced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think we can&#39;t find the path?&quot;. She tried to not sound worried. This place was giving her the heebie-jeebies. Not least of all due to the tail stuffed down the back of her pants, aching to be free.<br />
<br />
James shrugged again, this time with a lot less nonchalance. &quot;I don&#39;t know sis... I can&#39;t explain it. But Mom and Dad will find it in no time.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced around, keeping his front to his sister. &quot;I think. I think I&#39;m going to go for a lie down. What&#39;s your plan?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jess shook her head. &quot;Dunno.&quot; A lie-down did sound good. But being in the same room as her brother seemed risky, more chance of exposing her growth to him. Another room would be better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think I&#39;m going to set a fire going and sit on the couches in the living room. Maybe read one of those books.&quot; <br />
<br />
James smiled, relieved, and began backing away. &quot;Cool, I&#39;ll catch you later so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess squinted at his odd behaviour. This place really was making everyone act weird. She turned into the sitting room, closed the door behind her and waited. James&#39;s footsteps ascended the wooden stairs, creaking loudly the whole way. &#39;Perfect&#39; she thought, the loud stairs would signal his arrival if he was coming back down. Relieved she turned and plopped into one of the oversized soft couches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh&quot;, she winced, jumping upright, a tear in her eye as her tail was pinched beneath her ass. Cursing under her breath she stood, rubbing her ass and tail through her jeans. It needed to come out.<br />
<br />
She glanced around, all doors to the room were closed, and the heavy red curtains were drawn, the room was isolated. Quietly she made her way to the hall door and turned the large ornate key, locking the door closed. She repeated the same with the key on the door to the kitchen. She had total privacy.<br />
<br />
With shaking hands she unbuttoned her jeans and pulled them down a half a foot. The pressure on her lower back where the tail was growing from instantly faded, and was quickly replaced by pins and needles as the bloodflow returned fully. She winced at the utterly alien feeling of pins and needles in her new limb. <br />
<br />
It took almost two minutes for the feeling to subside, almost involuntarily she twitched her tail to test it. It was a bizarre, and she could tell the tail was still trapped in her pant leg. Reaching behind she grabbed the warm appendage. Her eyes jammed shut at the feel of it. It felt like normal skin, like grabbing a wrist, but the sensation was all wrong. With some wriggling she managed to free it from it&#39;s denim prison to let it dangle behind her. She turned to stare back at it. A pale fleshy tail, down to her knees, capped with a bush of fiery red hair, just like her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus I&#39;m a freak...&quot; She winced, tears coming to her eyes, staring down at the awful appendage. Jess already had serious body issues, and she knew it. She tried to ignore them, knew that it wasn&#39;t her fault and that she should accept herself; but sometimes it still hurt.<br />
<br />
She was short, overly pale, skinny, red-haired, freckle prone in the summer, flat-chested, and worst of all, her vagina looked like an angry uncooked kebab. She was already having enough trouble with boys taking an interest in such an awkward childish looking girl. Now all hopes and dreams were smashed. What kind of man would want a woman with a tail? Despair and panic were beginning to set in. Jess recognised the start of a panic attack. She knew she had to think of something else, anything. <br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, in through her nose and out through her mouth she looked around. A wall of books! That would do. <br />
<br />
She went to take a step, legs caught in her jeans. Not looking down, not wanting to acknowledge the tail she continued her breathing exercises and closed her eyes, barely keeping together. She bent down and pulled her jeans loose, one leg at a time, kicking them off to the side and standing upright with a *huff*.<br />
<br />
She could do this. She strolled to the bookcase, her stomach jumped again, and she felt nauseous as she felt the tickle of the bushy tail on the back of her knee.<br />
<br />
She shook her head, clearing what she could and looked at the books in front of her. All old books, classics, wonderful leatherbound hardbacks. Gold and silver inlay lettering. Whomever&#39;s Cabin this was, they were an avid reader. <br />
<br />
Her head turned, there was one book that stood out, or rather, didn&#39;t. Only one spine was unlettered, no name, to title, no author. <br />
<br />
<br />
Drawn to it she pulled it loose and felt the heft of it in her hand. Opening the cover revealed a handwritten inscription on the inner cover.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The Diary of Anita Kowalski&quot;, Jess breathed. She opened it on a random page and read, &quot;Day 48 in the Cabin, It happened again last night, Miles and I gave in and now we&#39;ve paid the price. The I&#39;m now sporting six new teats running down my chest, and Miles&#39; breasts have grown. With every fuck were becoming more and more animal like. Is there no way out of here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wide-eyed Jess snapped the book shut. Dropping it with a *thud*.<br />
<br />
Shaking she stood over it. This couldn&#39;t be. Tears were flowing down her face freely now. What was this place?<br />
<br />
She had to know...<br />
<br />
She leaned over, fingers wrapping around the rough leather cover. She had to find out.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Two hours later Jess sat staring into the fireplace at the crackling log she had set. Her face was impassive now, she had calmed to a sort of zen apathy, tears long since dried on her face. There had been no sign of her parents, nor a peep from her brother. She had finished Anita&#39;s Diary some ten minutes past. She read all about their arrival, about how they attributed their changes to the animal&#39;&#39;s they called out after arrival, how they couldn&#39;t find their way out, and how each lustful encounter changed them more and more. It seemed unreal, too much like a movie, or a fantasy novel; this couldn&#39;t happen in real life. <br />
<br />
And yet, here she was sitting in the Cabin with a Cow&#39;s tail between her leg. At least she figured it was a Cow&#39;s. She remembered saying her brother was full of bullshit the night they arrived. And that he had said the word &quot;Horse&quot;. She figured, if the diary was right, that he must be cursed too. She struggled to think if her parents had said something, with an animal in it. How would she break the news to her family? Would she even? How mad would it seem if she was the only one. If her brother was fine, her mother was fine and her father was fine, and there was no curse. Just her freaky body.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was just her, she thought. Maybe there was no curse. She stared at the diary. I had warned of changes borne from masturbation, sex and locking the changes in on orgasm. Jess&#39;s eyebrows furrowed. The book did say that changes, starting on sexual activity wouldn&#39;t lock in place unless the person had an orgasm. An idea bubbled in her head. She could test out this curse. She could masturbate a bit. See if something changed, then stop and let the changes reversed. She&#39;d know then if the curse was real. And she could warn everyone else. At least she could warn her parents not to say animal names.<br />
<br />
Jess placed the book off to the side and slid forward on the couch, so that she was almost hanging over the edge. Legs spread she could still smell the muffy dried smell of her pussy from soaking her panties the night before. She badly needed new clothes. Slipping her hand down under the elastic she twitched at the feeling of her fingers running through her puffy folds. She held her hand there for a few moments, relishing the warm pressure on her vulva. She could feel blood beginning to circulate, how she was getting so horny so quickly was a surprise to her.<br />
<br />
Moving her hand she could feel the silky juices of her pussy had begun to flow, lubricating everything. She remembered then why she was doing this, changes. A quick glance around revealed nothing. Her other hand went to her face, running over everything, nothing.<br />
<br />
She had to be sure. With a few wriggles she threw off her jumper and tee, to leave her all but naked on the couch. She stared down, her nipples had hardened against the air. They tingled even without her touching them. Her right hand returned to beneath her panties while her left grabbed what little tit-flesh she had. She gasped, her breasts were more sensitive than they&#39;d ever had before. Her rubbing increased, both hands working. Her panties and right hand quickly became a sodden mess, while her left roughly mashed at her breasts, leaving her gasping with every breath.<br />
<br />
For almost a minute she completely forgot why she was doing this, then something felt different. Her chest felt different. Each heave felt oddly harder, though she was not out of breath at all. Focusing on her chest, cross-eyed, her jaw dropped. Cupped in her left hand was an actual mound of tit-flesh. Not massive mind, but at least a large B cup, verging on C. A far cry from the mosquito bites she had had before. <br />
<br />
The curse was real.<br />
<br />
Her hands shot up, pussy and chest aching, as she stood, feeling the effect of gravity on her chest for the first time. The slight tugging was heavenly. She bit her lip at the feeling. She loved it.<br />
<br />
Just staring at her chest she marvelled the shape of her tits, young, firm, pointy nipples with not too much areola around them. They seemed just what she had imagined she should have. Thoughts of new dresses, better form fitting outfits, showing cleavage, turning heads. She bounced on the spot, marvelling at the bouncing tits, giggling at the feeling. Maybe this place wasn&#39;t so bad.<br />
<br />
With a happy sigh she plopped down again, once again wincing at the feeling of sitting on her tail.<br />
<br />
It all came crashing back. The curse, the cabin it was all real. <br />
<br />
She looked down at her chest. Breast flesh already shrinking. Fading. Disappearing.<br />
<br />
Maybe...<br />
<br />
Maybe one would be okay, Jess thought. After all, this wasn&#39;t a bad change. If she did this, locked it in, then did no more, she could have her cake and eat it too. Who  wouldn&#39;t want to have bigger breasts!?<br />
<br />
Heat already rising she returned her hands to their idle mischief. Right returning to her warm wet folds. Left coaxing her tits back to growing.<br />
<br />
It took only a moment this time before her breasts began surging. She gasped as they grew to their maximum size. Perfect, she gasped, hazy. She needed to cum to lock this in. She needed to change tact. She stopped running her fingers through her folds and instead used her ring and index finger to part them, attacking her exposed clit with practised motion from her middle finger.<br />
<br />
Her legs spasmed at the shock that ran through her. She felt her chest heave again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeesss...&quot; she hissed, that was it. Her hands were full, bountiful cups. C-cups. She would turn heads with these on her small frame. She kept up the attack. Closing her eyes. Imagining herself with one of the large muscular football players in her school. Being roughed around, ploughed, tits bouncing around. <br />
<br />
Another spasm. She could almost feel him filling her. She mashed her tits harder. Finger buzzing on her clit. Another spasm, and another and another. Waves on a beach, crashing higher and higher. Until finally, the tide pulled out and a tidal wave roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnnggghh&quot;. *Splap* Her pussy spasmed and squirted, drenching her already wet panties, juiced running down her asscrack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ffffucck&quot;, Jess moaned, still red-faced and writhing in aftershocks. How would she get that cleaned? <br />
<br />
Toes finally unclenching as the aftershocks subsided, she opened her eyes to marvel at her breasts.<br />
<br />
Her smile quickly turned to shock. There was far too much.<br />
<br />
She shuffled back up the couch, she didn&#39;t have C-cups. These were... She didn&#39;t even know what size these were. Each breast was the size of a watermelon, pale, veiny,  drooping, thumb sized teats pointing down. These weren&#39;t firm, they hung and rested their mass on her stomach as she sat inclined. <br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo&quot; Jess whined. &quot;No, no, no&quot; She stood, heft of the hanging melons almost toppling her frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is worse!&quot; Panic was setting in again.</p>
