<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having her needs sated finally let her relax. As her cock draped itself over the slack legs of her small companion and her muscles untensed, a burning sensation filled her aching body. Although release had been exactly what she needed, the aftermath clearly said to not do it again soon after or she would come to regret it.<br />
<br />
Playing with a few coins lying at her side, letting them fall through her fingers, she basked in the afterglow of her orgasm for a while.<br />
<br />
A small weight on her tail made itself apparent again however and she dreaded having to move her head to get a better look now that she lay there, eyes simply watching her ceiling.<br />
<br />
Still, riding high on endorphins made it surprisingly easy for her to move her head and eyes at least, without incurring the wrath of her sore muscles. Struggling to not wince overmuch at the pain in her muscles, the focus of her gaze was the kobold lying on her tail, panting like her life depended on it. Twitching claws and swollen stomach all painted a picture of absolute debauchery. The tip of its muzzle was barely visible beyond its cum-filled belly.<br />
<br />
The previously sky blue scales on her abdomen looked white now, with the backdrop of cum making the skin nearly invisible with how taut it was.<br />
<br />
Observing the small female made her aware of a pressure in her head that was difficult to describe. Most like the sensation she got when the app added additional memories to her head, but somehow jumbled. Trying to identify the kobold by name, or thinking about how they met to find out what the app changed to integrate her existence only brought on a kind of ‘thought-soup’, a chaotic mess of memories and half remembered events.<br />
<br />
Trying to sort out the mess in her head seemed fruitless, each time she anchored a memory down in her mind, it simply warped, changed and fled away from her metaphorical grip.<br />
<br />
Now getting an actual headache from thinking about it, she resolved to simply try and ask the small thing if it knew what was going on. Being a creation of the app had to have some kind of advantage.<br />
<br />
Seeing that the kobold had calmed down some now and was only rubbing its claws lightly over its gravid belly got her to start getting some answers.<br />
<br />
“So,...uhm what’s your name?” she asked while lifting her tail a bit, raising the kobold up to get a better angle to speak with the small reptile and give her some support.<br />
<br />
Being moved seemed to break the kobold out of her stupor. With a cute squeak coming out of her muzzle she gathered herself as she slid down a bit on the bigger tail of her mistress and once again rested her wet pussy against Ambers balls.<br />
<br />
A brief shudder. She rubbed her small scales absent-mindedly and got a confused and hesitant look on her face, thinking really hard about the question yet still unable to answer. After a while she shot Amber an uncertain look.<br />
<br />
The tiny lizard seemed as lost as she was now that the spontaneous sex was over.<br />
<br />
Having a sinking suspicion now, Amber tried something to confirm it, “Come on, I know you can talk.”<br />
<br />
Like a switch was flipped something clicked in her head, the previously muddled half remembered facts rearranged themselves and though it still was a complete mess, one thing stood out.<br />
<br />
The complete certainty that the small being could talk.<br />
<br />
The same instant Amber had that revelation, the kobolds face lit up, corners of her muzzle stretching wide and showing small pointy teeth in a reptilian smile, “I don’t have a name mistress.” she squeaked, a proud look on her face for being able to answer her question.<br />
<br />
The fact that she just altered reality by talking wasn’t really that surprising to Amber to be honest, she had done the same thing with the app after all, but it would seem the app had a problem with bigger reality altering statements or making life out of nowhere or whatever and was unable to correctly generate it without input from her.<br />
<br />
Amber suspected that it would resolve itself soon enough after a while, though helping the app along was probably a good idea.<br />
<br />
Relaxing once again now that she found out what was causing the strange feeling in the back of her head, she continued talking with her kobold servant, seeing if what she thought was happening was correct, “You don’t need to be coy with me Liz, I know you aren’t stupid.”<br />
<br />
And exactly what she thought would happen, happened.<br />
<br />
Once more reality hiccuped and ‘Liz’s” smile transformed into a smirk, her eyes brighter than before and shining with intelligence, “I know mistress, I’m sorry, just found It funny y’know? Because you just blew my brains out with that dick of yours.”<br />
<br />
A small laugh bubbled out of her, but was quickly silenced by a wince. Liz’s small claws once more gingerly began to rub her bloated stomach, looking at it with somewhat strained eyes.<br />
<br />
Seeing this Amber quickly thought of a way to alleviate the kobolds pain.<br />
<br />
“I hope you aren’t in pain, I know you can take more cum than seems possible but tell me and I can try to not fill you up that much next time.” she said concerned, banking on her intent to help the app along.<br />
<br />
Before her eyes, the once taut stomach deflated a bit. Not any less full than previously but spread out more, the small lizards skin having far more give than before. It was less of a full to bursting balloon and more like a bag full of marshmallow now. The kobolds face also seemed less pained and more exhausted instead. Amber couldn’t help herself and leaned forward a bit, fascinated, to poke Liz’s abdomen. She saw it give way to her finger easily.<br />
<br />
“Stop, it tickles!” Liz giggled swatting her hand lightly, not really trying to dislodge it, “And no, you don’t need to worry, just sore, like you I imagine.”<br />
<br />
An eager look flickered across her face, “We can do one more round though mistress, I can take it!”<br />
<br />
Retreating her finger and resting her back against her coin bed again, Amber looked at the ceiling of her apartment. White plaster speckled with small droplets of cum that threatened to fall back onto her, distorting the usual uniformity. She was tempted, she had to admit, but simply to sore. Getting it on again would only serve to frustrate her and make her unable to enjoy herself due to straining already pained muscles.<br />
<br />
“No thanks Liz, lets just rest for a while.” getting and idea, she added, “How about a little massage, I can tell you want to. Just don’t overdo it.”<br />
<br />
With and eager smile the lizard tried to get up, which was an ordeal in itself. Freeing herself from Ambers flaccid, but still quite massive in relation to her penis, which had trapped her leg underneath it took a bit of clever manoeuvring. Thankfully being tired helped in that regard, avoiding it springing to attention immediately upon being touched. Ambers tail gave the kobold the necessary leverage to finally get to her feet, solid as a wall to push of of for the small thing.<br />
<br />
Wobbling a bit with her big tummy in the way, Liz went to her mistresses breasts first, just as she liked it, still dripping a bit out of her pussy. As the kobold started massaging her breast-flesh, Amber finally noticed how sensitive they were, having endured her not so gentle hands in her throes of pleasure.<br />
<br />
The lizards expert claws managed to relieve the not-quite full on pain in her breasts quickly and it simply felt heavenly to not lift a finger and get pampered like this.<br />
<br />
Liz slowed down after a few minutes of careful and methodical movements, thinking if she should move on to the other aches of her mistress, stay working on her breasts or simply collapse into the valley of her cleavage. As the kobold was busy deciding what to do, Amber once again started trying to make sense of the mess inside her head that were the apps implanted memories, now that she could concentrate on something other than her aching body.<br />
<br />
What started as chaotic not-facts constantly in flux got more solid each time she spoke with Liz, giving the kobold a firmer identity and affirming reality as she saw fit.<br />
<br />
One glaring blob of twisted probability she could feel remained however, how Liz came to be.<br />
<br />
Was she an alien, a distant relative of her dragon ancestors maybe?<br />
<br />
A spell gone wrong?<br />
<br />
Or she could be a robot, made exclusively for Ambers pleasure.<br />
<br />
Maybe even her child? Who knows what would happen if Amber impregnated someone with her dragon cock.<br />
<br />
The possibilities were literally endless with reality still uncertain.<br />
<br />
Or she could simply enjoy her massage and see what would come of it...</p>
