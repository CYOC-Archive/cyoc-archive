<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyrene and Dustin kissed, and their tongues locked and danced in each other’s mouths in an extreme display of romance. Then suddenly Tyrene pulled away when she heard the sound of footsteps and felt her heart drop. Dustin paused feeling a bit confused, but then he heard the steps too. Someone was running towards them, and Dustin didn’t like it so he moved to protect Tyrene as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
Then Nazara rounded the corner to witness something out of her greatest nightmares. Her daughter, a fully grown adult with an elegant and attractive young body that even rivaled her mother’s, and what’s more was that there was an incredibly muscular male who she had no idea existed until this moment. Immediately Nazara’s went into a fiery rage, and she shouted,&quot;Tyrene... you’re.. a-and.... nnnnrrrrgh! GUARDS SEIZE THIS PUTRID PEASANT OF A MALE IN MY DAUGHTER&#39;S CHAMBER AT ONCE!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked ready for a fight as several warrior females rushed in, and he looked all around him and as Tyrene muttered,&quot;U-Uh....&quot; <br />
<br />
Dustin roared,&quot;Stand back! I got this, my love!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love...?!&quot; Nazara roared furiously, and several warriors charged at Dustin.<br />
<br />
But thinking fast Tyrene lunged forward, wrapping her arms around Dustin&#39;s body which made all of the guards pause in horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish my lover and I were both somewhere safe!&quot; Tyrene muttered as fast as she could then suddenly the couple disappeared in an instant and everyone in the room was shocked. Nazara&#39;s eye twitched, and she let out a bellowing roar that filled the entire mountainside with fear, realizing that she should’ve taken more action to prevent this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile within a cave on a mountain thousands of miles from where they were, Tyrene and Dustin came to rest in a much safer place. Dustin paused unsure what just happened when Tyrene caught him off-guard, and ended up tackling him to the ground with a large glomp.<br />
<br />
Dustin hit the floor with a large thud, and looked down to see Tyrene nuzzling his strong muscular chest. &quot;Oh I just knew you would come,&quot; She cheered caressing Dustin&#39;s muscular abs and kissing the tip of his snout,&quot;My big, dreamy, brave lover~&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin blushed and looked over Tyrene&#39;s body with her breasts looking like firm E cups, and her plump heart shaped rear, not even taking into account of the dragons&#39; titanic form. Dustin then wrapped his claws around his new lover and sat up, hugging her back, albeit confused beyond anything he’s ever experienced. <br />
<br />
&quot;What... just happened...?&quot; He asked both puzzled about his situation, but aroused by the nude goddess on top of him.<br />
<br />
Tyrene then paused and whimpered,&quot;Oops, oh how rude of me, I’m so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then stood up and brushed off what dirt she had on her body in front of Dustin and said,&quot;My name is Tyrene, daughter of Nazara, goddess of dragons and queen to the race. Technically I’m the new princess, but after what we just did I think she pretty much disowned me by now,&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin’s eyes went wide for a moment and he asked,&quot;W-Wait?! Goddess... you... you’re a goddess? Demigoddess?! And... wait... that was your mother back there?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene nodded slowly then side,&quot;Well I won’t say demigoddess... because I don’t have a father technically.... she basically just turned me into her egg... or at least that’s the... uh... less graphic version.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded slowly then he looked down at his body and blushed,&quot;Is she the one who did... this... to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? Oh no, that was my doing,&quot; Tyrene explained only for Dustin to shout,&quot;Wait, what?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene was the shock on Dustin’s face and whimpered,&quot;I... didn’t want to be a child, and... sort of wished I guess that we could be together. I wanted a powerful, loving  male to protect me and be my mate, and now you’re just that, Dustin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene quickly wrapped her arms around Dustin again and the mighty drake paused and asked,&quot;Y-You know my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene looked up at him slightly confused and said,&quot;Of course I do! Why wouldn’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin paused even more confused, and with everything he went through he just thought to himself,&quot;Must just be some kind of goddess thing I don’t know about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene then glanced down at Dustin&#39;s massive cock and grinned mischievously, bringing her hand down to gently stroke the shaft. Dustin paused then he looked down and saw just what was happening and his face turned red as his masculinity sprang back up to full length for the glorious female. &quot;So what do you say we really piss of my mom by going all the way for the first time? Let’s carve a new chapter into our story as a new king and queen,&quot; Tyrene purred bending over in front Dustin with a wide grin, raising her tail to expose her sex.<br />
<br />
______<br />
<br />
Meanwhile with Nazara....<br />
<br />
The guards were all lined up in the same room where Tyrene hatched, and Nazara was absolutely livid. &quot;You useless, useless guards!!&quot; Nazara roared,&quot;Why weren’t any of you on duty?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-My Queen, y-you haven’t t-trainee us yet, a-and we haven’t even received orders,&quot; A trainee muttered with dull yellow scales on her back, and orang ones on her front.<br />
<br />
Nazara glared at the dragoness, and suddenly she started shrinking, her armor soon growing heavy. Her breasts soon disappeared, and she lost her womanly curves gaining broad shoulders and a flat rear. Then suddenly she looked down in horror and watched a barbed appendage sprout out between her legs, as well as a set of scaled testicles. Soon her teeth retreated into her mouth, and she was left as a skinny male hatchling unable to do anything at all.<br />
<br />
The new boy started bawling without anything else to do, and he ended up wetting the floor beneath him in fear when another female cried,&quot;Xiala!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nazara then looked to the female who cried out, and she appeared to have blue scales on her backside, and on her front were teal scales. The moment the goddess faced this woman the soldier shrieked and whined,&quot;Oops...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot; Nazara said,&quot;You care for this incompetent excuse for a child?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well... she.... he was my childhood best friend until....&quot; She whined then Nazara interrupted her,&quot;Then take care of your son before he makes another mess, and get out of my sight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-My... what?&quot; The dragoness whimpered then looked down to see her armor disappear.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her breasts swelled up and her nipples started leaking milk that dropped onto the ground. As the female struggled to hold the weight of her new breasts, stretch marks appeared on her stomach and when she looked up she noticed that the boy now had the same eyes, and scale colors as she did, the two looked like mother and son without a second thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-But I... I’m a-a virgi...&quot; The dragoness whimpered but then Nazara said,&quot;Yes, a virgin single mother with a crying infant, now feed him so we don’t have to deal with that mouth of his. <br />
<br />
&quot;B-But....&quot; She whimpered, and Nazara roared,&quot;Now, or I’ll make you experience the birth as well!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragoness let out a small whine and quickly picked up the child, and looked down as the boy looked up at her with tears in his eyes. She then ran off with her new son in her hands, and Nazara looked to the rest of her guards and said,&quot;Now, does anyone else have anything to say?!&quot;<br />
<br />
They all shook their head and looked afraid to do anything in her presence, and Nazara nodded and said,&quot;Good! Now spread the word that there’s a bounty for whoever can return my darling princess to me from the purple scaled fool who took her away! Tell them to knock her out first, and if they can bring me the male alive. There will be nothing better than watching him turn female and push out clutch after clutch from a feminine vagina for the rest of his days!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes m-ma&#39;am,&quot; they all replied and Nazara nodded and said,&quot;Good, now do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside the cave the new mother was tending to her her child, who finally stopped crying after the traumatic experience. However now the mother was in more distress now and tears fell down her cheeks as she whimpered,&quot;Oh Xiala... d-did we really deserve this? Is our goddess really this cruel?&quot;<br />
<br />
The child paused and looked up at his mother and tried to speak with his toothless mouth,&quot;Nnah....Nnnna....Nnnnajjjjiiiiaaaaaaawoooo....&quot;<br />
<br />
The mother nodded and said,&quot;That’s right, Nagialo.... me, or... mama now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her son, Xiala nodded and said,&quot;M.... Ma..ma...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you hungry? You should eat,&quot; Nagialo muttered and lifted her son&#39;s face to her nipple, and the boy paused and hesitated to touch his mother’s breast. Eventually though he latched right on and started suckling like any hungry newborn infant, and Nagialo smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll fix this... I have to but... how?&quot; Nagialo muttered out loud and started pacing back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can’t be a single mom, I don’t know what to do. Do I just go back to my parents and explain how I enraged our goddess?! They’d disown me, and maybe even kill Xiala! Find a mate? Do I really want to have more children? Plus what kind of guy goes after single moms?&quot; Nagialo said aloud and Xiala looked up and said,&quot;Mmamma?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nagialo blushed and whimpered,&quot;R-Right you still understand me... but how do I...&quot;<br />
Nagialo then gulped and muttered to herself,&quot;Tyrene...&quot;<br />
<br />
Xiala tilted his head and asked,&quot;Tyw..wweeen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nagialo blushed and looked down at her kid again and whimpered,&quot;D-Did I say that out loud...?&quot; The mother then bit her lip and sighed,&quot;Xiala do you trust me... if I commit treason to turn you back to normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Back with Tyrene and Dustin...<br />
<br />
The two were having the time of their lives, losing their virginities to each other in a distant cave under the stars. Dustin grunted on top of Tyrene, pounding her needy cunt and slapping her with his balls. Tyrene felt the adrenaline coursing through her body as Dustin squeezed her nice firm breasts, and filled her tight pussy with his massive cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Al-m-most there...!&quot; Dustin growled pumping his hips faster and faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I can’t t-take it! I-I’m gonna....!&quot; Tyrene cried out then roared as loud as she could feeling herself climax, and she shot out a stream of fire as she spilled her vaginal juices all over Dustin’s cock. Dustin didn’t fall too far behind as he let out an even greater roar, and spraying his load into Tyrene&#39;s virgin sex, and his load overflowed out of Tyrene’s clit creating quite the sticky mess.<br />
<br />
Afterwards the two laughed, and Tyrene was left panting as she giggled,&quot;It’s official... we’re mates,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Urragh,&quot; Dustin groaned then he chuckled,&quot;Should I pull out now? I’m exhausted,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think you need to,&quot; Tyrene replied panting, and Dustin nodded to her and with a grunt he dismounted his new mate, and started panting heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wow... so that’s how that feels...&quot; Dustin muttered, and he looked up to see Tyrene roll over onto her stomach and see the mess that they made. Dustin’s pelvis was completely covered in a mixture of their sexual fluids, as well as Tyrene’s. What’s more Tyrene&#39;s cunt had a steady dripping trail of cum from Dustin’s masculine cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Shit uh...&quot; Dustin muttered blushing and Tyrene laughed,&quot;Aw, you’re cute when you blush Dustin, don’t worry about the mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay... p-princess,&quot; Dustin muttered and Tyrene laughed louder,&quot;Don’t call me that anymore, just call me Tyrene. We are mates after all, my shimmering violet king. I can’t wait to have your eggs inside of me to start our new kingdom,&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin paused then nodded and asked,&quot;W-Wait, King... doesn’t that make you a Queen now if w-we actually do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene laughed and said,&quot;Why so nervous? You’ll make a great father, and one hell of a husband. In fact, I wish that you were as immortal as I am now, so we won’t ever be apart!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin blushed as his body emitted a faint glow that stopped shortly afterwards and he blinked twice and muttered,&quot;You’re incredible....&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene then smiled and said,&quot;Thank you, but now I think that it’s time for me to rest. You really know how to take my breath away when I’m in the moment dear~&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin then stood up and kissed Tyrene on the forehead and said,&quot;...and you took my heart away like no other woman could. Sleep tight, and I’ll protect you with all of my might, my love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrene then smiled and slowly drifted off into slumber, and Dustin looked towards the exit of the cave and sighed,&quot;Alright, now what to do now that I’m here...&quot;</p>
