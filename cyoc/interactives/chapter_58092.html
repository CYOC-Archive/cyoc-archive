<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda giggled softly and pat my head as she unleashed me. She pet my head and said to me, &quot;Go greet him Josie. Go greet him like the dog you are.&quot; She ordered. My ears folded back and I whined, but her wish made me obedient and loyal to her. I got up and started padding over to the male dog sniffing around the bush. <br />
<br />
As I got nearer him I could smell his male musk and I know he could smell my in heat scent. The closer I got the stronger his musk became. His scent seemed to shoot right through my nose and right to my vulva. I hated the fact that his scent was turning me on. When I reached him I noticed that he was just a mutt, but a couple seconds later before my eyes I watched the dog change into a german shepherd just like me. My 'owner' wished that he would be an appropriate mate that would produce high priced puppies.<br />
<br />
My tail began wagging for some reason as I padded up along side of him. My nose twitching as I sniffed up under his tail as dogs did, my tail wagging up high as he returned the favor sniffing at me. I sniffed at him growing further aroused. This aroused him as well I could see his sheath swelling and his member starting to slide out. The musk from his penis was much stronger than it was before, more potent. I did what I was told to! I greeted the male and started to walk away. <br />
<br />
After a couple steps I felt a new urge. I squatted down and piddled a little, my tail lifted as if I've always known how to use the rest room. I got back up and padded a couple more steps towards my owner. The male sniffed at my leavings. He followed after me giving a lick to my vulva.<br />
<br />
I yelped and jumped at the surprising sensation turning around I snarled at the male. He barked and wagged his tail but made no move. I turned back around, that's when he made his move. The next thing I knew was that there was a weight on my back. <br />
<br />
I tried to jump and run but he wasn't going to allow it, he bit the back of my neck and tugged at my scruff with a low growl, telling me to stay still that I was to be his bitch. His bite triggered something inside of me, something that made my legs feel so heavy that I couldn't move them. As I did try to escape all that I managed to do was spread my hind legs a slight bit for the male.<br />
<br />
I barked a few shrill yelpling barks trying to shout, &quot;get off! I'm not a bitch. I'm not a bitch!&quot; But nobody could hear me, and his bite held a hold over me that I couldn't escape. I wiggled lightly in a futile effort, feeling his haunches pressing up against my own, my tail shoved off to the side by his flank. I felt his forelegs lock around me and hold at my flanks and inner thighs, holding my hind legs so I couldn't move the. I tried moving my hind end around so he wouldn't find the entrance that he searched for. Unknowingly that's what dogs do.<br />
<br />
He missed only twice before I felt him enter my vulva. I felt his hot slick tip slide up my puffy vulva and began sliding up into my. I howled out, &quot;Nooooooo!&quot; But being in heat my vulva clenched instinctively holding him steady as he pressed himself fully into my new female body. I began panting, lowering my head, resigning myself to what was going to happen.<br />
<br />
The male on my back started rocking his hips, drawing his length out of my body and thrusting back into me. Though I didn't want to admit it, it began feeling good, my new body wanted this. I found myself lowering my fore half and pressing back up against the male. Panting my ears fell back as my walls gripped and rippled along his length, feeling his pre cum spraying into me. I shuddered at the feeling though my mind was amazed at how much pre this stud was pumping into me. Much more than I had as a human male.<br />
<br />
But what I didn't know was that his precum wasn't just making my channel slicker, it was coating my natural female spermicides, negating them from being of any use. I was beginning to enjoy myself, my eyes closed slowly as I lifted my muzzle howling in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Amanda was walking towards me and the male while he mounted me from behind and started making a bitch out of me. I didn't notice that she had been watching and listening. I didn't hear what she had to say, she wished, &quot;I wish that Josie would have this male's puppies and stay as she is for five years, having puppies twice a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't hear her wish as I howled my pleasure. My body began responding to her wish, my ovaries ejecting eight eggs into my tubes for the male. I felt his knot begin growing, the next thing I knew was that it was inside me and growing larger. I pressed myself back against him, whimpering with need. I yelped loudly as I reached a sudden climax around this stray, my walls clenching him tight as his knot grew and tied with me.<br />
<br />
The male shifted pressing his knot into me as my walls clenched, forming an almost water tight tie. He howled I could see his length jerking and spurting his seed up into my body. Shot after shot of hot dog cum was spraying into my body. My body betraying me further by helping the stud's puppy milk work it's way deeper into my body and bathe my eggs, instantly fertilizing them. I didn't know it at that moment that I was going to be a mother to eight pups in a couple months. <br />
<br />
The male dismounted me and stood tail to tail with me for a long 20 minutes. I could swear that he was climaxing the whole time, when he pulled I felt a splash of dog cum come rushing out of my vulva. After he did I padded over to my master and sat down sticking a hind leg into the air. I began cleaning myself as she leashed me again. She leashed the male dog as well before she took me and my stud home. <br />
<br />
Me and my mate, mated three more times that night before we both passed out tired from our exertions. I slept next to my mate using him as my pillow and him using me the same. It wasn't for a couple more weeks that I knew I was pregnant! I could tell I was gaining wait. I was eating more, my teats felt more sensitive. It was then that I knew I was going to be stuck for a long while. The ring wouldn't change me back if I was pregnant or nursing. <br />
<br />
Only time can tell what happens to me now...</p>
