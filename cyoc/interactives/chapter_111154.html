<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It hadn&#39;t been easy for Bryan, but he had kept track of the days since his bovine transformation due to his impulsive, ill-conceived use of the Chronivac. <br />
<br />
This was the thirteenth day since the 20-year-old man had turned himself into a nearly one-ton Charolais bull.  In that time, he had discovered that his main problem was not adjusting to the physical changes. That had been almost scarily simple to achieve.<br />
<br />
His major problem was how, when he failed to keep his mind focused on his dilemma, it became frightfully easy to accept his lot in his new life. Chewing his cud, sleeping in the barn on Mr. Peace&#39;s ranch, switching his tail to swat at the flies that pestered him from dawn to dusk, never giving him any peace. The loathsome insects buzzed around his great head, landed on his ears and on the nose that now wore a large, metal ring that Peace or his ranch-hands used to keep the big, bulky bull under control. <br />
<br />
After waking, and realizing that his day was starting again, he walked from the barn, trotted down a path to the pond, beginning the morning with a long drink of the stale, warm water. The routine was maddening. There had been chances to break the monotony. The rancher ordered the hands to put Bryan into the pasture with the cows, hoping each day that the bull that had just fallen into his possession would do its natural duty and impregnate some of his cows. <br />
<br />
At first, it had been easy to resist that path. He was a man, despite appearances. But in close quarters with some of the cows, instincts in the bovine brain asserted themselves, and the urges to mate with some of the cows became harder to resist. He felt his huge balls, swollen and welcoming of possible release, swing beneath his body as he trotted away from the watering pond. <br />
<br />
At a distance, he saw Zeke on horseback riding around the pasture. Zeke had been someone that the human Bryan had known. After numerous failed attempts to communicate his situation to Zeke, the transformed man gave up. Low moos and loud bellows did nothing to convey the reality of his fate to anyone around him.  Why, he asked himself each day, had he ever chosen to use the device to turn himself into a bull? He got caught up in his question yet again, trying to come up with an answer that didn&#39;t paint him as a fool, and didn&#39;t realize that Zeke was riding his horse closer.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t realize anything until he felt the sharp pain from a tug at the nose ring connected with the chain that Zeke could use to force Bryan to follow him. &quot;C&#39;mon, big boy. You have another appointment with the doc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Forced to follow Zeke toward the corral, Bryan saw he was being confined in a stall constructed from a series of metal frames. Once Zeke had positioned him, he saw the vet and Mr. Peace approach with some unidentified items in their hands.  The vet handed a plastic rod with some dangling wires into Zeke&#39;s hands. &quot;If you could take care of that for us,&quot; the vet said.<br />
Zeke laughed and spit on the ground. &quot;Sure, I get the dirty work,&quot; he said, but in a jovial manner, as he pulled on some heavy gloves.<br />
He approached the bars of the holding pen. In the narrow space, Bryan could not turn his head to keep track of Zeke&#39;s intentions, but they became very clear when he felt his tail pushed to the side and a foreign object rammed hard into his rectum. He let out a surprised bellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this hurt?&quot; Peace asked curiously, moving closer with a plastic container held on a long stick.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; The vet replied gruffly. &quot;It&#39;s electric current.&quot;<br />
<br />
What are they doing? Bryan kept trying to look over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the vet worked a small control set to deliver a serious jolt into the rectal probe. Bryan bellowed with surprise, even more so when he felt his cock release a heavy stream of bull semen that Peace collected with a deft touch in the plastic container that he held near the tip of the bull&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is really more efficient than trying to get him to mount every cow in your herd,&quot; the vet explained. &quot;And we can freeze what we collect. It will remain viable for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still don&#39;t understand why a bull would ignore a whole herd of receptive cows,&quot; Peace said crossly.<br />
<br />
Zeke snickered. &quot;Maybe you got a gay bull,&quot; he theorized.<br />
<br />
The vet delivered another shock, causing Bryan to bellow again as he released another load of thick semen into the waiting plastic receptacle. On this occasion, the shock didn&#39;t come as a complete surprise, and there was something... well, not appealing, but definitely arousing, from the stimulating shocks. <br />
<br />
&quot;A few sessions and we will collect enough from this guy to inseminate your cows for years,&quot; the vet said. &quot;Then you can just cut them off and fatten him up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he sure as hell isn&#39;t good for anything else,&quot; the rancher admitted.<br />
<br />
Bryan listened in near panic. He had played right into their hands by refusing to have anything to do with the cows. Now, they could force sperm from him that the vet could freeze and keep stored for years.<br />
<br />
And once they had all they needed, the vet would...<br />
<br />
Another electric shock caused another spasm in his large bull cock, producing more sperm for the collector&#39;s cup.<br />
<br />
His balls were churning now, but how long would they let him keep them? <br />
<br />
Even worse, if possible, had been the second part of the vet&#39;s declaration. &quot;Fatten him up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan realized that his luck was about to run out. He wasn&#39;t facing more carefree days. Now, each day would bring him one step closer to the slaughterhouse unless he could think of a way to get out of this mess.<br />
<br />
He needed to get near a Chronivac....<br />
<br />
He felt another zap of energy and another spasm that added to the semen collected for the deep-freeze. &quot;That should be enough for today,&quot; the vet said. &quot;We can have another session tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan felt Zeke slide out the probe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well give him a reward,&quot; Peace said. &quot;Give him some of the best feed, and let&#39;s start fattening him up while we are still collecting our samples.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Zeke said.<br />
<br />
Later, once the vet and Peace left, Zeke filled a trough with some top-grade feed. Bryan stared in dumb horror at the food, but after some weak resistance on his part, the bovine instincts took over.<br />
<br />
Actually, the food tasted great. Bryan ate until he felt absolutely stuffed.</p>
