<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caroline, barefoot, walked Diane cautiously out to her car, hoping to avoid notice.  Unlocking the doors, she got behind the wheel of her 2020 Lexus, while Diane entered and sat down gently, her poise as regal as ever.  Diane noticed that her teacher had to move her seat forward and adjust her rearview mirror.<br />
<br />
&#39;It wasn&#39;t my imagination, she has gotten smaller.  Not as tiny as my precious Brianna, but I must have a good 7 or 8 inches on her.  This can only be the work of some supernatural entity.  I&#39;ll have to be watchful for other such phenomena.  Perhaps I can acquire some magic of my own, at last.&#39;<br />
<br />
Caroline pulled out of the school parking lot, and started heading for home.  Halfway there, she frowned.  She didn&#39;t remember her husband, but she had one, didn&#39;t she?  She couldn&#39;t take a girl home with her, let alone a teenager!  &quot;Do you mind if we go to a hotel, Mist..Diane?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane reached over to place her hand on Caroline&#39;s, squeezing it gently.  The poor woman&#39;s nerves were shot.  &quot;If you want me to be your Mistress, that&#39;s fine, dear.  And a hotel would be acceptable, if it&#39;s of suitable quality.  Perhaps the Holiday Inn the next town over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um...sure....Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane had never actually been a Dom before.  Oh, to be sure, her relationship with Brianne had overtones of it, as the cute girl was very submissive to her, but there was some steel in her, even if it only surfaced in the right circumstances.  And of course, Cassidy was too aggressive of a lover to play such games.  But different lovers needed a different approach, and it was obvious Caroline needed someone to direct her.  Take care of her.  And Diane found she was perfectly willing to do so.<br />
<br />
She kept a hold of Caroline&#39;s hand the whole time, until they reached the parking lot.  Caroline got out to  rent the room, then came back for Diane (who&#39;d taken the time to reapply her eyeshadow and lipstick, as well as to text her other two loves about her whereabouts- promising details later.  Brianna&#39;s reaction had been &quot;Oh my!&quot; while Cassidy merely said &quot;Wish I was there, you go, girl!&quot;).  Then the two went up to their room.<br />
<br />
Upon entering, Caroline seemed very nervous, so Diane guided her to the bed, and placed her hands on the smaller woman&#39;s shoulders, pushing her down.  &quot;You&#39;re trembling like a scared rabbit.  So that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to call you, Rabbit.  I won&#39;t frighten you, and I promise to be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then took a step back, and removed her heels, then her dress.  She hesitated before revealing her flaw, and stood there in all her non-glory.  She couldn&#39;t meet Caroline&#39;s gaze.  &quot;I apologize for not being a complete woman.  If you find me repugnant, we can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, tentatively, gently, Caroline&#39;s hands reached up to touch Diane&#39;s unformed chest.  &quot;No...you&#39;re more of a woman than I am, even without breasts.  You&#39;re so beautiful...I&#39;m not worthy to look upon you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane blushed ever so slightly.  &quot;With your simple praise, you have proven your worth.  Do you want me, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...yes!  Please...take me...have your way with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane gently pushed Caroline back onto the bed, and removed her clothing, her hands lingering as she ran them along the woman&#39;s body.  She had a nice, trim figured, and Diane appreciated that she shaved meticulously- even between her legs.  Diane had never really been a fan of pubic hair- she shaved hers religiously, and had even gotten Cassidy, who didn&#39;t care as much for her appearance, into the habit (though, to be fair, the ash blonde had sparse hair to begin with).<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t tried to persuade Brianna to do so yet, though she had to admit, the girl&#39;s hair was very soft, and she was a natural ginger.  So she&#39;d made an exception for the moment.<br />
<br />
She placed her hand on Caroline&#39;s breasts, pushing them and kneading them with her fingers before leaning over and bending low to lick a nipple, the tip of her tongue making little clockwise circles around the areola.  Caroline sucked in a sharp breath, and her back began to arch.  &#39;From such a simple touch?  Her husband hasn&#39;t been treating her right if she&#39;s so desperate for affection.  The fiend.&#39;<br />
<br />
For in Diane&#39;s estimation, Caroline had a fine body, one that deserved gentle loving (and often).  She nipped at the nipple, sucking on it, even as she continued to massage it&#39;s twin, laying her body across Caroline&#39;s.  Then she bit the woman&#39;s soft flesh every so gently, pretending her eyeteeth were true fangs- oh she was certain the girl&#39;s blood would be sweet.<br />
<br />
Diane had regular sexual fantasies about being a vampire.  &#39;The Vampire Lovers&#39; was one of her favorite movies, after all.  Caroline gasped at the bite, but didn&#39;t resist.  So Diane continued, moving her attentions downward, scraping her teeth against the woman&#39;s skin, down her body, to her taut belly.  &quot;You exercise often, I see.  I approve. I insist my lovers take good care of themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yes...Mistress.  I do.  I will.  Oh please..I can&#39;t take it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, shh.  I do not rush.  Everything has it&#39;s time...but your time is close, do not fret.  I will share with you such pleasures...&quot;  She made her way to she soft flesh between Caroline&#39;s thighs, kissing and nibbling and sucking as she grew slowly, inexorably, closer to her lover&#39;s maidenhood.  Once there, she ran the tip of her tongue around the edges of the woman&#39;s slit before poking it within her, finding it already slick with desire.  She felt Caroline&#39;s fingers twining through her raven locks, which elicited a purr from Diane- the tall girl found the sensation of someone playing with her hair intoxicating.  For Diane, this was an erogenous zone, and she was happy when someone she was attracted to found that out.<br />
<br />
She pressed her face closer to Caroline&#39;s precious treasure, teasing her labia and the woman&#39;s moans were like music to her ears.  She imagined Caroline was a valuable stringed instrument, a violin or a cello, perhaps, and played her- she wasn&#39;t the musician Cassidy was, but she took pride in her art.<br />
<br />
Caroline&#39;s release was explosive, an all-consuming fire that overwhelmed her being.  She&#39;d been denied this for so long...and now she was free.  Even as she was overcome by emotion, she felt herself being pulled into strong arms, and her lover&#39;s lips nuzzled into her hair as she nibbled on her ears, before planting sweet kisses along her jawline.<br />
<br />
Hands roamed freely along her body until they found her breasts, and held them, even as Diane caressed her nipples with her thumbs.  The sounds of pleasure that Caroline emitted were like notes of pure music, until finally, she could eke no more from the woman, who lay there, exhausted, yet sated.<br />
<br />
There were tears in Caroline&#39;s eyes.  &quot;Thank you...thank you...&quot;  and then &quot;I love you&quot;, a natural response for someone who has felt such release.  &quot;You are very welcome, my dear.  But this is only the beginning for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Caroline realized that Diane was far from done, her eyes widened.  Then she sank into a fog of wonderful bliss...</p>
