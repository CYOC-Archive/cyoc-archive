<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now this will be kind of hard to explain.<br />
<br />
When the Wave hit, Penny was screaming and then howling as she shrunk and started growing chihuahua hair all over her.  I saw her hand and feet crack, darken, shrink, and then thicken as then turned into paws and grimaced as she clutched her face as it protruded into a short snout, pushing them back.<br />
<br />
All the while, my back was cracking at every joint as I shot up in height and then began to muscle up.<br />
I fell to my knees and then my hands as they began to swell and swell as I felt newfound power.<br />
They ripped apart my shirt and pants into tattered pieces of cloth, leaving me entirely naked.<br />
I was too busy flexing to really care though.<br />
<br />
And then I got even more distracted when I felt my dick grow in.<br />
<br />
My clitoris began to lengthen and thicken, all the while becoming slightly veiny - it was at this point I knew what it was.<br />
It thickened<br />
And lengthened<br />
And thickened<br />
And lengthened<br />
Until it stood a good 6 inches hard, throbbing.<br />
Two nice-sized testicles dropped in afterward, the left before the right.<br />
<br />
My eyes were transfixed on the bouncing head of my new male member.<br />
I swung it to the right and left, up and down and laughed as it bounced, dripping clear pre-cum from its tip.<br />
<br />
I reached to touch it, with four arms now (I didn&#39;t realize I had the extra unbuffed two until later) when I went flaccid looking at Joe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Penny and I were too focused on our own transformations at the time, and so Joe&#39;s went unnoticed, till the end.<br />
<br />
He had fallen out of his wheelchair, and should have landed straight on his face.<br />
<br />
But his head wasn&#39;t in the right position.  <br />
Replacing it was a 17-inch flaccid and thick penis, with balls to match, that flopped on the ground as Joe flailed around helplessly on his now entirely limbless body.<br />
<br />
Gently, as Penny watched, hyperventilating, I picked him up, with my un-muscular arms, and placed him gingerly on his kitchen chair, pulling off his now too-tight shirt and busted track shorts.<br />
<br />
A limbless, squirming, entirely female body sat before us wide-eyed mutants.<br />
Morphologically, it couldn&#39;t have been more than 25-30 years old.<br />
<br />
Replacing its head was the aforementioned dick that rested, balls and all, between the left and center breasts of the three jiggling D-cups that lined themselves evenly horizontally on its chest.<br />
<br />
And in its crotch stuck out a female head connected by a small, stiff &quot;neck&quot;.<br />
It was gorgeous in every regard, with angled cheeks, beautiful brown hair, and a cute nose,<br />
Save for its extremely sweaty and agitated, beet-red flushed expression,<br />
And the cute but puckered anus that entirely replaced its mouth.<br />
<br />
Joe was farting out of it, angrily and often before he had to stop since his nose was right above the asshole.<br />
At the time, I was sort of happy that the bastard would be permanently shut up.<br />
But still, I was horrified.<br />
<br />
Penny and I just looked at each other for the next minute, mouths agape.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
We got dressed, and then dressed Joe.  <br />
For once, his baggy old man clothing came in handy.<br />
At least for him and Penny - I had to wear a bathrobe to cover my top.<br />
<br />
Quick note, we only covered Joe&#39;s top.<br />
His bottom half&#39;s relocated head would fit in anything, and, turning him over, Penny and I found a horizontally-placed mouth between the cheeks of his gorgeous pear-shaped ass (I didn&#39;t have one before, and I still don&#39;t have one now . . .).<br />
It could breathe and move as if it was talking, but it couldn&#39;t produce any vocal sound.<br />
It still can&#39;t.<br />
Continuing on,<br />
<br />
I noticed that Penny was better right away, trying constantly to de-stress the situation by cracking jokes and shit like that.<br />
I did too, and it was then, I&#39;ve gotta say, that we began to bond as we made dinner that night, but we were still quite worried for Joe.<br />
<br />
He was entirely helpless now.  He couldn&#39;t speak anymore, effectively move independently anymore, and no longer had arms to use to help himself out with a few things.<br />
His field of vision was even reduced.<br />
<br />
We watched the news as we ate dinner - the reheated fried green tomatoes with some good-old mac-and-cheese on the side - but had to turn it off once Joe started crying.  We didn&#39;t notice until he started shaking in his &quot;designated&quot; chair and sniffling uncontrollably.<br />
I picked him up and cradled him with my buff arms and wiped his tears and snot with my unbuffed pair.<br />
<br />
Since he couldn&#39;t respond, after he relaxed, we guessed for him reasons as to why he became upset and asked for him to nod if we were right.<br />
He slightly nodded when we said &quot;the news&quot; and teared up a good deal so when we said &quot;his mutation&quot; but really nodded when we realized we forgot he couldn&#39;t eat anymore.<br />
<br />
We laid him out front-first on the dining table, on some towels with plastic wrap on top of them, and spread his cheeks to spoon-feed him mac-and-cheese.<br />
<br />
It was so dang weird but strangely cute.  It was like we were shoveling food up an asshole, but instead the asshole was a mouth with very nice lips that smiled often and mouthed &quot;thank you&quot; repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I spontaneously said &quot;good job&quot; after Joe started to cry again on the 5th spoon.<br />
We all froze.<br />
And then Penny and I just lay into it, even hugging Joe towards the end of the bowl, to which we cheered and started running around.<br />
We couldn&#39;t stop laughing when we fed him the green tomatoes.<br />
It was sort of hard since Joe wouldn&#39;t stop laughing (silently), which not only prevented him from biting, but caused his asscheeks to keep wobbling and hitting our hands holding the food.<br />
And every time it happened, we laughed even more.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t believe it that night.<br />
I&#39;d must have given Joe about 200 compliments.<br />
I hadn&#39;t ever laughed that much though.<br />
<br />
A little time later, we went to wash up.<br />
Penny volunteered to help me wash Joe, but I declined - I had to do it before sometimes when Joe &quot;wasn&#39;t feeling like it&quot;, but now it was even easier.<br />
<br />
I carried him upstairs on my right shoulder with ease, stripped him, and plopped him in the shower with me - I threw on my swimming shorts and associated sports bra.  I gave him and his new lady body (which I could tell he was inquisitive about) a good washup - scrubbing his three tits and his nice ass quickly - while always making sure he could actually breathe (his mouth was constantly squished, and his nose was pretty close to the shower floor).<br />
We almost completed the task without incident before I accidentally made his dick hard while cleaning it - leading to several flustered reactions . . . and curiosity on my part.<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, come on - pretty much every woman who gained a penis stroked it off on the first night.<br />
I used my buff arms though, so it lasted much shorter than I thought it would . . .<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t help but note how helpless and shy Joe looked as I dried him and every crevasse of his body off - he gingerly shimmied his body as I dried his back and shoulders and blushed as I went between the asscheeks.<br />
He even smiled - I could see it in his eyes, cheeks, and awkwardly stretched anal sphincter - when I blow-dried his hair.<br />
<br />
When we were all done and dry - Penny took way longer because of her new fur - Penny and I brushed our teeth (Penny&#39;s new dog-snout jaw is weird to brush) and then went on to Joe.  It was weird, to say the least, but, again, so weirdly adorable to see him spit out water.<br />
<br />
I helped him take a piss before bed - I just held him over the toilet bowl and watched the dick do its business.<br />
Penny and I tried the same - the fantastic feat of pissing standing up - and missed the bowl on the first 2 attempts.<br />
<br />
And then we went to bed.<br />
Penny slept in the guest bedroom, and I in Joe&#39;s (well-kept because I always make it each morning and change its sheets) bed that night - I had to make sure he stayed on his side and didn&#39;t suffocate if the sheets came to close to his nose and if his mouth was stifled or anything, and to attend to him if he needed to take a midnight shit (like he usually did).<br />
I didn&#39;t like it at first.<br />
<br />
We couldn&#39;t go to sleep for a while because of Penny&#39;s damn Chihuahua-yelp snoring, so I just surfed cooking videos on YouTube during the meantime, logging recipes (that I thought Joe might like) on my phone for future use.<br />
<br />
I was completely caught off guard when Joe snuggled up against me, crotch-mounted head&#39;s eyes gazing curiously at my phone screen.<br />
<br />
His eyes were the only unchanged thing on his body. Fierce, very wise brown eyes that could be hilarious, furious, and jokingly cruel at the same time.<br />
And they still were, at that moment, albeit wide, feminine, childlike, and perhaps, kind?<br />
<br />
I looked back at my phone the moment he gazed up, puckering my lips impudently.<br />
He snuggled closer to me, his three-breasts and right hip gently cushioning my side as his penis lay still, flopped on the bed.<br />
And then he slept.<br />
<br />
I may or may not have laid an arm or two around him after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe that Joe was crying earlier because he now was entirely helpless.  Forever now dependent on our help.<br />
But our help was good.<br />
MY help was good.<br />
My last thought before I fell asleep, cuddling Joe, was my realization that it wouldn&#39;t actually be too bad.</p>
