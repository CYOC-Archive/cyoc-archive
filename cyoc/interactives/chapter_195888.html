<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike AKA “Urban Gap Explorer” zoomed in on the animal/human hybrid community located under ground in NYC. It was a tent city at best, made from trash, shopping carts and other stuff the human world wouldn’t miss. For streetlights there were Christmas lights and judging people carrying buckets of what looked to be water there was no running water. Instead, their water came from a tap in a water line to some building and their power likely came from the same spot. <br />
<br />
“This is amazing.” Said Mike as he zoomed in on his camera and took in the streets. Some of the former humans looked human enough with only animal ears, tails or patches of scales. They wore mostly human cloths, some however walked around in as little to no cloths. In documentary testimonials it is said that those effected by the virus found having cloths on fur or scaled cover skin a kin to itching powder. Some wore cloths anyhow because that was what they were used to some didn’t anymore.<br />
<br />
There where multiple different animals as well, from felines to canines, from birds to reptiles, there was even one who he thought looked like a cross with a honeybee. Insect hybrids were very rare just like sea creature hybrids were. The one he supposed to be an insect was a women who looked like a fairy with bee like wings coming out of her back and two antennae coming out of her head. <br />
<br />
He saw movement in one of the nearby “buildings/huts” he zoomed in to see the same anthro lion man having sex with a deer woman of some kind. Both seamed to be rather enjoying it and Mike blushed and turned the camera away and followed a pregnant looking horse woman, wearing what looked to be a loan cloth with a modern sports bar walking arm in arm with a bunny man who wore just a pair of shorts. The bunny man stopped and then kissed the horse women before going down on one knee and kissing her pregnant fur covered belly. <br />
<br />
“I guess we can confirm they are breeding down here, but is the child in there a bunny? A horse? A bunny horse?” said Mike as he kept looking around. A couple of reptiles humanoids were hanging around under a series of heat lamps and heaters. A child who looked normal from the waist up but with the body of a giant snake from the waist down came slithering by the couple being chased by another child who actually flew on bird like wings coming out of her back, her feet where talons as they laughed and played.<br />
<br />
“As you can see…” started Mike only to have a giant hand come down on her camera and crushing it in a fur covered hand. He was lifted before he could do anything else and was face to face with a tiger man wearing nothing but a belt and was looking pissed. Behind him was a monkey woman wearing a discarded bikini and had some human like flesh on her face and chest, with an almost normal looking face and coming behind her was a pair of wolves…no one was a fox and they all looked pissed.<br />
<br />
“Who the fuck are you?” growled the tiger man<br />
<br />
“I am Mike…I run an urban exploration channel on…” started Mike<br />
<br />
“Damn…can’t you leave us alone we aren’t hurting anyone down here.” Snapped the monkey women<br />
<br />
“What Do we do with him?” asked the wolf, a woman he noticed now wearing what looked to be the remains of an old male police uniform. <br />
<br />
“We let him go.” Answered the fox who was wearing another discarded police uniform…that is when Mike realized those two had to be transformed cops. “We aren’t animals like they think.”<br />
<br />
“Still what if they come down?” inquired the Tiger man<br />
<br />
“Then we destroy this tunnel and build a new one.” Answered a new voice as a man who looked totally human aside from strange claw tipped hands. He had some black and white fur on his arms. “I made this one I can destroy it and make another one. I am a badger after all.”<br />
<br />
“Please let me go.” Begged Mike as he pissed himself.<br />
<br />
“Coward.” said the monkey women as she rolled her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Let him go Stacy, just make sure his video camera is destroyed.” said the police fox to the tiger man, as Mike realized this giant body builder strength level tiger man had once been a woman. <br />
<br />
“Fine…but before I do.” Stated Stacy as she made a gargling sound before spitting on Mike’s face, before letting him go. The monkey women walked up and slapped him before spitting on him herself. <br />
<br />
“Blindfold him, I will take him back to the surface.” Said the wolf cop as Mike found himself blindfolded. <br />
<br />
He stumped a bit in the dark as he was pulled along by clawed hands. In felt like forever but in the end he was shoved out a door landing in a puddle. He ripped the blindfold off to find he was in an alley just off of times square. He stood up and looked around he was alone. <br />
<br />
“Damn…I would have been trending with that video.” cursed Mike as he walked into times square and headed toward one of the massive fast-food places, he was hungry. He walked past the no animal hybrid signs without even taking notice of it, the staff looked at him odd, being that he was so dirty but he money was good and he soon found himself a table eating. <br />
<br />
Mike was unaware that he was patient zero for a new variant of the animal virus, one that was not only more infectious but defeated the vaccines already made and every moment he was in the store, ever person he came into contact with he was spreading it to. The world would never be the same.  </p>
