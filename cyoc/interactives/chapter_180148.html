<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clydes trainers began to feel tight. Clyde knew that his trainers were half a size too small, so something was going on.<br />
He watched as they got tighter and tighter, his toes pushing against the material. But before they broke, he noticed his jeans, once covering his ankles, now above his white socks. His skin was visible, he could even feel the warm breeze on them.<br />
He looked over his body, the sleeves of his zipper-up hoodie were beginning to shorten to his lengthening body. He had to unzip it before it was too far. He unzipped it from the top all the way to bottom and pulled it off. He noticed his shirt was lifted up a little bit from his stomach.<br />
<br />
That’s what panic began to actually set in.<br />
<br />
“W-what the hell is happening!?” He asked, stuttering, not shouting. He didn’t want to anger Alaska, although he wasn’t looking at her, he was preoccupied with his changes.<br />
She was silent, watching him grow.<br />
<br />
He looked at his arms, starting to notice the light hair he had on his arms beginning to lengthen. It grew, creating a much thicker layer of body hair. He could barely feel the change.<br />
He had to check if the rest of his body was changing the same.<br />
Without thinking about Alaska seeing, he lifted his shortsleeved shirt up, looking at his torso.<br />
He was right. It was an even thicker, even hairier layer of body hair, trailing from his belly button up his chest.<br />
<br />
Then he noticed the other change that was happening around his torso. He was his stomach. It was much flatter than before. In fact, he could swear he had abs...<br />
He rubbed his hand over it.<br />
They were abs alright. He was jacked. Not only was he jacked, but continued to be jacking up.<br />
<br />
He looked at his arms, his biceps. They were growing, big time.<br />
<br />
He looked down and noticed how much longer his legs had gotten. His thighs and calves were growing too. He looked just in time for his flies to suddenly<br />
<br />
POP<br />
<br />
The button popped right off his jeans, he didn’t look to where it hit, he was too busy watching himself to grow.<br />
<br />
He felt his clothes against his expanding muscles. He even noticed his chest was growing larger, his pecs expanding against his shirt, lifting higher and higher, revealing more and more of his amazing abs.<br />
<br />
It was a lot to take in. He knew exactly what was happening, he didn’t know how, but he knew. He scratched his beard and let out a breath. Wait... his BEARD!?<br />
<br />
He felt all over his face. The volume of facial hair had increased from 0% to full beard. Even his hair was longer. He could feel his jawline, his facial structure had become more masculine and strong.<br />
<br />
Each and every muscle in his body was increased by some capacity. He felt the veins in his arms bulging, his arms thicker. Even his butt was bigger, tighter and firmer.<br />
<br />
He could feel the growth slowing down, he placed his hands all over his body. Caressing it’s growing state one last time before it stopped. He rubbed almost everywhere. He got to his penis, he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t care if the literal owner of the place shop was there, he had to feel it.<br />
He unbuckled his belt and let his jeans... sit there? He hand to manually pull them down as the size of his legs had made them skin tight. It was wasn’t hard with his how much stronger he was.<br />
<br />
He placed his muscular hands around his underwear and felt his penis and... it was the same...<br />
<br />
“Just wait, it’s almost done,” Alaska said. Clyde looked up at her for the first time in a while... well looking up wasn’t the the same as it was. His head was level with her chin. His eyes looking directly into her breasts.<br />
<br />
Before he could answer though, he felt a tiny tweak in his nipples. His head quickly looked down and saw the once regular nipples on his chest were now extra hard and had suddenly twice as pointy. Not to mention they were also twice as sensitive, which wasn’t great against great against his much tighter shirt.<br />
<br />
He looked up to Alaska. However she simply lifted one finger, which give the impression of, ‘one more moment’.<br />
<br />
He looked back down and failed to see anything else change.<br />
Until suddenly his penis quickly began to grow. Longer and longer, making the outline of the bulge more and more pronounced. He could also feel his testicles getting bigger. It was so sexually pleasurable to him. He could feel his semi getting harder.<br />
It was fully hard by the time it had stopped. He had to see it. He was overwhelmed with sexual ecstasy, but his awareness of Alaska was much more present right now.<br />
<br />
Clearly she sensed this, she sighed aloud before grabbed the waistband of his underwear and pulling it down to his knees.<br />
<br />
His hard penis pointed further than Clyde knew they even could. Alaska looked at it for a few moments before looking at the rest of his body.<br />
She looked back to his penis and said, “wow, that’s gotta be around 7 or 8 inches... flaccid I’d say. But hard... well it’s difficult to say, really. Let’s go for a solid 13.” <br />
<br />
“W-wha... how...” Clyde, evidently, struggled to say anything. But he got there after a few attempts, “how did you do this?”<br />
“How? I would have thought I was a why question, personally. But if y’want a good answer, let’s just say... a little bit of magic,” she finished with a wink.</p>
