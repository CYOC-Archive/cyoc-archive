<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Carl and the real Jeff were arguing about Jeff's new identical twin, the new Jeff had turned to the computer and began typing away at the commands of the Chronivac program. He took a moment to turn the emitter and scan both Jeff and Carl. With Jeff’s and Carl’s Profile on the Chronivac, the new Jeff started to type away.  The first thing he changed was his own duration from 1 hour to permanent, that way the real Jeff won’t change him back.  Once he was done with his, he then he entered Jeff's and Carl’s profile.  During that time, he thought about the time he was once a sock and was only treated for the real Jeff’s annual wanking.  So he believes its time for a little redemption.<br />
<br />
Going back to the inanimate package, he chooses clothing and decided on a pair of socks.  And the perfect targets he needed were of course the real Jeff and Carl.  Sure Jeff was the person that wanked him back when he was just a sock, but it was Carl who single handedly gave Jeff the sock in the first place without knowing what he would do with it.  Both of them were at fault and now that the sock has turned into the exact copy of Jeff, he was looking for revenge.  He then moved to other settings to make sure his vengeance is complete.  He set the mental change to off that was when they turn into socks, they won’t remember about their previous lives.  He then set the awareness setting to off as well that way they would be nothing but socks to begin with.  The duration of the change would be ten minutes so he would watch the two changes before their eyes.  Then finally, he set the duration of when they will remain in that form to never, making sure his vengeance is complete.  Once he skimmed the whole thing the sock Jeff smiled and was ready to pull this off.  He clicked on the start icon and the wave of energy hit both the real Jeff and Carl.<br />
<br />
Once the energy passed, the two felt a little woozy and wasn’t sure what happened.  “Whoa…  That was weird.  What happened?” Jeff asked a little dazed.  Carl then rubbed his head and said, “I don’t know dude.  But I don’t feel so hot.”  As they were feeling the after effects of the hit, the real Jeff looked at his hand and notice that it was looking a little pale.  Almost immediately, the pale skin started to turn white like a ghost.  Jeff was completely confused to this and wondered what it happening.  That’s then he noticed his nails falling off the tips of his fingers and falling to the ground.  His eyes were wide in shock and couldn’t believe what he was seeing.  “What the Hell!” he said in complete shock and awe.  But then he heard the voice of his friend saying, “Hey Jeff?  Something weird is happening.”  Jeff turned to his friend and wondered what he just said.  That’s when he noticed his friend taking off his shirt to feel something strange with it.  What he saw was that the little chest hair he had vanished completely and his skin was looking white in the middle.  Jeff watched on and couldn’t believe what he was seeing.  “Whu…  What’s happening to us?!” he screamed out loud in complete disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Oh…  I’m just giving you two a taste of your own medicine.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to the direction of the voice and noticed that it was the clone Jeff smiling very slyly.  The real Jeff starred on and was completely confused by this predicament.  “You?” he asked in pure confusion. “But Why?”  The clone Jeff repositions himself on the seat and answered, “Because all my life I was used as something to put your filthy feet in and your private masturbations.  Now that I’m human, I can now do things I had never done in my life.  There’s no way I’m returning to a crusty stiff sock that suffered one too many wanks.  I think now it’s time for you to know how it feels like to be a sock!”  Jeff’s eyes were wide in fear and was completely shocked.  As the clone was talking, the real Jeff’s changes progressed.  He looked at his hands again and noticed they were completely white as the texture changed from smooth to rough as cotton pattern slowly appeared on his skin.  He looked at his other hand and notice that it too had changed the same way as the first one.  He then felt something falling from his face and rubbed his head to see what it is.  Looking at his cotton hand, he noticed that it was his actual hair.  He was quickly loosing his hair as it falls off his head and floating to the floor.  Looking on, he soon realized what was happening is true.  The clone is turning Jeff into a real sock.<br />
<br />
Carl looked at his body and was more confused then ever.  Looking down at his body, the changes continued to progress.  The white color spread all over his chest and changed into the same type of cotton texture as Jeff’s hands.  His nipples started to grow smaller and smaller until they disappeared completely on his chest.  The same goes with his belly button as it closed up and disappeared on his stomach.  Feeling do confused, he looked at the clone and said, “But why me?  I haven’t done anything to you!”  The clone Jeff looked at him very sternly and said, “You gave me to Jeff so he could use me as a masturbation tool.  I can’t believe you did that to me.  You deserve the same punishment as Jeff.”<br />
<br />
Minutes passed as the two watches the changes that are going on.  Jeff look down at his hand and saw the white color texture spreading down to his arms.  He could see the little hairs on his arms sinking into his skins and leaves it completely smooth.  The white texture spread down his arms and was now down to his elbows.  He then look back at his hands and saw all of his fingers slowly merging into one pointed stump.  Now he has no hands to speak of.  What’s left of his hair on top of his head fell to the floor, as he was now completely bald.  He could even feel his eyebrows falling off over his eyes.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Carl looked at his changes and could tell they were getting worse.  The white cotton now covered most of his chest and he could feel his muscles deflating as his abs and pecks were non-existent.  He started to rub the texture and found it to be a little soft yet rough at the same time.  He could even feel his hair falling off the top of his head.  He still couldn’t believe that he has succumbed the same thing Jeff is suffering.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to look at his arms as the white cotton spread all the way up to his shoulders.  As he watched on, he noticed that his fingers and hands were getting floppy.  He soon realized that all the bones and muscles in his body vanished and deflated, making it impossible for him to move his hands.  The clone Jeff looked on and liked where this was going.  “Looks like your loosing all sensibility in the hands ‘Jeff’.  Soon enough, you won’t be able to move anything at all.” Said the clone Jeff as he chuckled about it a bit.  Jeff’s eyes were wide in complete fear as he soon realized that he was going to be lifeless very shortly.  He looked back at his hands and noticed that they too were flattening and it’s getting harder to move them.  The clone then got up and decided to help him out with something.  “Here, let me help you with your clothes.” He said very eagerly, “You won’t be needing them once the changes are finished.”  Slowly, the clone took off the real Jeff’s shirt and watched as the white cotton spread down to the chest.  Jeff watched his clone undressing him and find this to be a bit awkward when his clone is undressing him.<br />
<br />
Carl looked at this too and find that to be a bit strange.  But then if what the clone Jeff said is true, then he too should undress as well before he looses his arms and legs.  So he took off his shoes and socks then removed his pants.  As he was doing it, he could feel his insides melting and hollowing out.  His guess is that his stomach, lungs, and heart were being removed while his body mass continued to deflate like a hot air balloon.  Yet for some strange reason, he was alive and breathing.  He finds that all weird, but it would soon pass before his changes are finished.<br />
<br />
Back to Jeff, his clone self was busy removing the clothes his counterpart had on.  Once the shirt is fully taken off, the real Jeff felt a strange tingling sensation on his feet.  The clone Jeff looked at him strangly and said, “My…  Looks like your feet are changing next.  Why don’t you get on your bed so that way you won’t trip and fall?”  Almost instantly, the clone pushed Jeff down at the bed and started to untie his shoes.  He then looked at Carl, who is already half naked, and said, “You better sit on the bed too Carl.  Don’t want you to fall on the floor too you know.”  Carl looked at the clone and nodded in agreement.  Even if he was turning into a sock, he knew he might get hurt if he fall and hit his head.  Heading to the bed, he sat down and waited for the inevitable to happen.<br />
<br />
As the clone Jeff removed the real Jeff’s shoes, he slowly took off the socks slowly.  Since he was once a sock, taking off other people’s socks feels a little weird.  But he did enjoy this feeling as he finished removing them.  Once Jeff was barefooted, the clone watched on and notices the feet changing as well.  At the base of his foot, the skin grew paler and paler until it looked completely white.  The nail of each toe sinks into his skin and become nailess.  Then each toe began to move closer to each other and connected merging into the one pointed appendage just like his once hands.  The clone then rubbed his feet and could feel the texture turning to a soft cottoning texture.  He could even feel the foot compressing as it lost all the bones and muscles to control it.  The clone smiled and was enjoying Jeff’s and Carl’s punishment.  “Well Jeff, it would seem that your transforming quite well.” He said in pure anticipation, “Soon, you and your friend will be nothing but lifeless socks that I will be wearing for life.  Don’t worry; I will take good care of the two of you.  I will wear you, watch you, and ultimately masturbate with you.”  The last part made Jeff feared for his life.<br />
<br />
Carl listened to that sentence too and didn’t like it one bit.  Looking down at his feet, they too were changing the same way as Jeff’s were.  The nails were disappearing, the toes were merging together, and the skin grew white and the texture is made of cotton.  He could also feel it flattening and loosing all known movement.  He tried to wiggle his feet but they were completely none responsive.  He was completely scared of this.  He could even feel his hair falling off his head, leaving him completely bald.  And the hair on his arms and legs vanished completely.  Yet Carl can’t do anything to stop it.  All he has to do is sit back and watch the changes take over him.<br />
<br />
The same goes with Jeff as he watched the changes progressed up his legs when he felt the tingles.  He look down at his clone removing his belt and finds it strange to see him undressing himself.  “Now to get these pants off ya.” The clone said in a very eager voice, “Wouldn’t want them to get destroyed.”  He then slowly removed Jeff’s pants and slid them down his leg.  Once his legs were fully exposed, the clone looked on and saw the changes progressing upwards.  All the little hairs on his legs sank in and the white cotton spread upwards past his ankles and up his hips.  All the bones and muscles inside dissolved away and his legs were completely hollowed out.  His bottom half flapped away and he couldn’t move it at all.  The clone Jeff started to rub the leg texture and said, “Looks like you’re halfway there.  And I got to say; you are looking really good Jeff.  Can’t wait to try you out.”  He then looked at the real Jeff’s boxers and shook his head.  “Guess I should remove those too.” he then said, “Don’t want them ruin as well.”  He then turned to Carl and said the same thing to him as well.  “You better remove your boxers too Carl.  Don’t want them to get ripped as well.<br />
<br />
Carl saw the clone took off the boxers of the real Jeff and find it to be a bit creepy.  Then looking down at his legs, they were experiencing the same changes as well.  With the white cotton coming up his legs, his insides were emptying out and he was having difficulty moving them.  Thinking of no other choice, Carl started to take off his underwear and leave with the pile of clothes he already took off.  Now he’s completely naked with his privates showing, so he quickly covers it up.  But just as he did that, he felt a strange arousal in his groin.  Looking down, he noticed his penis beginning to stiffen up without him controlling it.  Jeff felt the same too as his sticked up and was sexually active.  The clone Jeff stood up and looked at both, knowing what will happen next.  “Oh, don’t panic.” He said in a very encouraging voice, “That’s just the changes spreading to your private areas.  A bit of a side effect from the transformation I think.  That will all pass when your dicks vanished.  You won’t be needing them anyways.”  That scared both the real Jeff and Carl the most as they watched their dicks changing before their eyes.<br />
<br />
Once their penises got erected, they began to grew smaller and thinner.  Their balls drew closer and shriveled up, emptying what was inside of them.  In a matter of seconds, their privates shrank into their skin and disappeared completely, leaving nothing but a bare crotch.  At the same time, they could feel their buttocks closing between their cheeks while their anuses were sealed up for good.  With their front and back ends vanished from them, the cotton went up to around their waist area and were deflated completely.  That caused them to collapse on the bed and was resting on it.  Now that they won’t be able to get, they had no other choice but to accept the changes.<br />
<br />
With their bottom half finished forming, something strange started to happen.  With their legs and waist nothing but white cotton, the top part of their former legs drawing closer together.  Once they merged, they moved downward to the legs and shortly with their feet.  Soon enough, their feet merged together and there was one long tube at the bottom.  After that, the bottom part then changed shapes and turned into the left and right sock respectably.  Jeff was the left sock while Carl is the white sock.  The clone Jeff watched the changes first hand and was loving every bit of it.  “Looks like you guys are almost finished.” said the clone Jeff, “But there are still things that needed to be fixed.”<br />
<br />
As soon as he said that, the changes kept on going, as the two couldn’t do anything to stop it.  Jeff’s chest was next to go as the white spread up his stomach and to his chest.  He could feel stuff disappearing both from the inside and outside.  Like Carl, his nipples shrank and vanished on his skin while his belly button was close off for good.  On the inside, he could feel his organs, bone, and muscles vanishing and his body compressed.  He couldn’t even breath or have a heartbeat because he had no lungs or heard to begin with.  But yet for some strange reason, he was still alive.  Within seconds, his body was completely flat and there was nothing identical to him that resembles his old self, except for his head.<br />
<br />
Carl’s changes, though his chest was finished changing, moved up his arms and hands.  The white cottony texture crept down his arms, elbows, and hands, removing all bones and muscles compressing them completely.  He then felt his hands change as well as his nails vanished and his fingers merged into one.  All that’s left was a pair of lifeless flat limps with stubs instead of hands.<br />
<br />
With their upper bodies almost done, both Jeff and Carl were feeling similar changed.  Like their legs and feet that changed, their arms and hands were doing something in a similar fashion.  Their useless arms made of cotton drew closer to their bodies.  The moment they connected, their arms begin to merge and vanished within their thin bodies.  Now they are just two big socks with all that remaining are their human heads.  But that will soon pass as the clone Jeff watched the changes and smirked.  “Almost done…” he said with cheer excitement, “Just a few more things that needed to be taken care of first.  Take one last look at the world around you gentlemen.  Cause this is the last time you will see everything.”<br />
<br />
The moment he said that, both Carl and Jeff’s heads started to tingle.  That’s when they know the last of the changes were taking place.  Slowly but surely, things on their faces started to disappear.  Their ears grew smaller and smaller until they disappeared completely, Leaving them completely deaf.  Their noses grew small too as they flatten in their faces, making it impossible to smell or breath.  Then their eyes started to feel incredibly heavy, as they were about to close.  They tried their best to stay awake, but fails as their eyes shut for the final time and were sealed up like a zipper.  This left them impossible to see anything at all.  With their faces gone, all that’s left there their mouths.  On the inside, their tongues shrank away and vanished into the already hallow throats.  Their teeth shrank away and vanished into their gums while their gums melted away.  With the inside of those mouths empty, their lips grew thinner until they’re non existent.  Almost immediately, their mouths were forced open and grew wider.  So wide, that their heads barely shrank away.  While the mouths were opening, the white cotton on their bodies spread to their faces and covered the last of their peach skin.  As all this was happening, their minds were getting completely hazy, making them slowly loose their memories.  Soon enough, they were forgetting about family, friends, school, childhood, dreams, just about everything.  Soon enough, their very existent vanished with, loosing everything in they once had.  Now once was Jeff and Carl, were nothing but huge ordinary white socks.<br />
<br />
As both Carl and Jeff turned to socks, the two then started to shrink until they’re nothing but regular size socks.  After ten minutes, what was once Jeff and Carl was nothing but a pair of useless, lifeless, inanimate socks.  The clone looked at it all and smiled saying, “All done.”  He then sat on the bed and took off his shoes and his own socks.  He then picked up the socks that were once the real Jeff and Carl and slowly slid them to his feet.  The moment he got his feet in, he wriggled his toes and liked how comforting it feels.  “Wow, these things are really comfortable.” The clone said with a very happy expression, “Thanks Jeff.  Thanks Carl.  You guys will make great socks for life!”  Getting up, he looked at the clothes that the real Jeff and Carl once wore and then the computer on the desk that have the Chronivac.  Looking at all of this, he rubbed his chin and said, “Now…  What am I going to do now?”</p>
