<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hannah and Darren found themselves gaping at one another, neither exactly sure how things had escalated to this point. &quot;Can someone explain to me how my house suddenly became everybody&#39;s go to hangout spot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No clue,&quot; Darren shrugged. &quot;Sorry Hannah, me and Steph just wanted to see what you were up to. I didn&#39;t know about everybody else.&quot; Hannah furrowed her brow, checking her backyard before anxiously glancing at the basement door. &quot;Its kinda quiet down there,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You don&#39;t think Abolith killed our teacbers do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren paused, it was a possibility. He shuddered though at the thought. She wouldn&#39;t, would she? They were just going to talk. What if she did though, even reduced to a 13 year old girl, Abolith was still a deadly assassin. The 14 year old was only shaken from his thoughts as Raiden and Sachiko now bounded into the living room, the two kits overflowing with energy. &quot;Darren wheres my mom,&quot; Raiden said excitedly. &quot;My grandma wanted to talk with her real quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepg, Darren, and Hannah now exchanged a worrisome look. They knew where Abolith was, yet they were pretty sure the elf would not be happy with her son seeing her as she currently was. &quot;Umm i&#39;ll go get her,&quot; Darren said quickly. &quot;You stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sprinting for the basement door, Darren now made his way downstairs. Hopefully Hannah and Steph could stall long enough for him to change Abolith back. As he descended the stairs, the worst case scenario also played out in his mind. What would he do if he found the teenage assassin standing over his dead teachers? As he reached the bottom of the stairs, Darren stopped dead in his tracks, incredibly confused by what be saw.<br />
<br />
Abolith was laughing. The teenage elf was actually enjoying herself. It struck Darren as incredibly off putting considering the stories he had heard of the assassins brutality. Instead of seeing a pint sized, steely eyed assassin he witnessed the auburn haired elf smiling as Pam, Stella, Gail, and Neela braided her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all Darren could utter as he stared at the bizarre scene. The grown down assassin having her hair braided by four teenage girls as she thumb wrestled Ewart. &quot;I umm don&#39;t mean to interrupt,&quot; he stammered. Darren paused, still flummoxed by the scene. He had not anticipated his teachers getting along with her. &quot;Can someone explain whats going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bonding,&quot; Pam stated. &quot;We talked with Abby and despite her....profession, we got to know her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby is actually pretty cool,&quot; Stella added. &quot;Believe it or not we seem to have alot in common.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren raised an eyebrow, they couldn&#39;t be serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its true Catalyst,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;Your teachers and myself appear to have quite a bit in common. I approve of them befriending Raiden, even if they won&#39;t stop calling me Abby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We talked about this Abby,&quot; Gail giggled. &quot;If your going to be our age than your going to be called Abby. No use fighting about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me,&quot; Ewart smirked. &quot;You can&#39;t win an argument with these four when they agree on something. I&#39;ve been trying for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the five teens now chuckled, Darren could only stare at them in utter astonishment. This was certainly the last thing he anticipated on seeing. &quot;Um okay,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Listen um Abolith. Raiden is looking for you. He wants to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
An anxious look now crossed the elves face as she looked between her new friends and the basement door. &quot;Well change me back then,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I don&#39;t want him to see me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to,&quot; Neela asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you feel if you suddenly found your mother as a teenager?&quot; The teachers now looked at one another, all of them silently agreeing it would be too weird. Instead the girls now squeezed Abolith in a friendly hug. &quot;We gotta do this again sometime,&quot; they sighed.<br />
<br />
Raiden tapped his foot anxiously as he awaited his mother. What was taking her so long. Unable to contain his excitement the kit now began to open the door. Abolith upon hearing this now fearfully turned to Darren, mouthing for him to hurry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Raiden called. &quot;Mom are you down here?&quot; Slowly the dark furred kit descended the stairs. As he reached the stairs he smiled as he gazed at Abolith and the others. &quot;Hi mom what cha doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talking with your friends,&quot; Abolith said quickly. Fortunately for the elf, Darren was able to reverse the spell just in time. The now adult Abolith smiled as her son gazed at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats with your hair mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My hair,&quot; she asked. Abolith now reached up, finding the braids the teachers had placed had remained when she returned to adulthood. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, her cheeks blushing. &quot;Your friends wished to give me a makeover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Raiden replied. &quot;Grandma wanted to see you about something.&quot; Abokuth nodded, slowly making her way towards the stairs. &quot;Hey mom,&quot; Raiden asked. &quot;Can I introduce my friends to grandmas?&quot; Abolith paused, a smile slowly spreading across her face. &quot;Yes Raiden I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
************************<br />
<br />
&quot;So the Catalyst transformed you,&quot; Fukushu asked as he watched Abolith brush her teeth. Abolith nodded, spitting out her toothpaste as she now approached the kitsune. The assassin had only just now told her beloved about her adventures that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think it was possible,&quot; she said as she began searching for something to change into. &quot;But Darren was able to transform into a 13 year old girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu simply chuckled, trying to imagine what his beloved Aboliths reaction had been. &quot;And then you met our sons friends,&quot; he stated. &quot;It would explain your...unique hairstyle when you returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith simply frowned, her eyes narrowing as she glared at Fukushu, the nine tailed kitsune chuckling softly. &quot;It was harmless fun beloved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; he smirked. Fukushu now became serious as he gazed at his wife. &quot;And that&#39;s when you talked with my mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Abolith sighed. &quot;Shizen asked that we stay here on a more permanent basis. For Raidens protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Yuriko will be thrilled,&quot; Fukushu said flatly. &quot;How did she even convince her to allow this to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our son is the newest celestial beloved,&quot; Abolith said softly. &quot;Despite Yuriko&#39;s misgivings she understands how significant that is.&quot; Fukushu simply nodded, the kitsune had been stunned to learn of Sachiko and Raidens divine status, a look of pride upon his vulpine features as he realized he was the father of a God.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure my mother wishes for us to visit soon,&quot; he said. Abolith nodded, the elf now sitting on the bed next to Fukushu as she stared into his eyes. &quot;She does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu sighed, patting his beloveds leg as he gazed into her eyes. The two had fought against wizards and his own people for nearly a century. Now, they were entering uncharted territory. Unlikely allies living under the roof of an old adversary, mending fences with the kitsune, and befriending the most unlikely of humans.</p>
