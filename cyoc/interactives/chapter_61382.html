<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school year had started off pretty odd this year. A student by the name of Sean K. <br />
had gone missing a month before classes started, though that wasn't really bad at all. As a <br />
person he was a total douchebag that liked picking on other people and he really was a <br />
pervert at heart. In actuality him disappearing wasn't the problem. The problem was Coach <br />
Patrick Christopher, a once social kinda gym teacher who got along with everyone and <br />
really didn't sway between the jocks or the nerdy guys. He was fair in sports, and liked <br />
helping around the school. Now looks wise he was pretty nice to look at, an exact 6 foot <br />
height, trim waist, broad muscular shoulders like that of a former football player and a <br />
good looking face of Irish descent. He had light brown hair that was a little long going <br />
back and light greek eyes. He never wore anything really tight but you could tell he was in <br />
really good shape.<br />
Well this year it all kinda changed, Coach Chris upon seeing him for the first time this year <br />
came in wearing a tight muscle tee, nylon shorts that lay above his knees and a smirk that <br />
really didn't read well with some in the class. other than his wardrobe his personality <br />
wasn't the best, he had most of the guys in the class who weren't really physically fit run <br />
laps and go harder than he did the jocks in the class. If anything he would just be chatting <br />
with them, laughing about the nerds in the class not being able to do the simplest shit and <br />
if anyone said otherwise he would be having them do pushups till the class ended. <br />
He really was one of those dick of a teacher coaches which no one ever expected Christ to <br />
act like and his personality flaws didn't end there. After class he decided to make it <br />
mandatory for all students to shower after class, the showers in the school hadn't been <br />
mandatory to use in forever and it seemed he only did thats just show that he could show <br />
off his body. When class ended, we would all be showering and he would come in strutting <br />
his shit like he wanted to show off. He really would put a show on, he would make sure to <br />
get the attention of everyone and than insult some of the skinnier or fatter kids in the <br />
class, he wouldn't stop there, the jocks he would even insult by showing his cock off and <br />
telling them how small they were. Coach Chris while hung like the preverbal horse, had <br />
the personality of a complete ass and he really didn't sit well with anyone lately. Sick part <br />
about him is once he showered is the fact he would put the same clothes on he had before <br />
showering, his jockstrap which everyone swore he never changed, his muscle tee and <br />
shorts, just like he was showering just for the hell of it. <br />
Well this went on for a while and he was arrogant as hell for a long time, he pretty much <br />
insulted every guy in the school and even got up to the point of insulting me and I was <br />
pissed. When he made fun of me, a guy half his age in the shower, I just stormed out and <br />
wanted to do something to screw him over. Thats when I found his clothes laying out on a <br />
locker room bench. I decided to hid his shit somewhere he wouldn't find it and see how he <br />
likes it. From that point I left with a smile on my face.<br />
         Coach Chris was exiting the shower, another day of getting off on how amazing he <br />
looked to all those little losers in the school. He loved showing off his muscular pro-<br />
athlete body and even better showing off his monster between his legs, sucks he had to <br />
hid it in his jockstrap everyday to keep it. Taking over this body was the best thing Sean <br />
had ever done, who would have thought finding that jockstrap in the locker room one day <br />
in summer school would give him the best body in the whole school district. Sean loved <br />
his muscular body, perfect ass, hung cock and the fact he could get any one he wanted, <br />
guy or girl. Chris's body was amazing in stamina took, he could screw for ours and shoot <br />
the biggest loads over and over again, the original owner was such a freaking waste with <br />
his morals and goody fucking two shoes attitude putting this body to waste. It was making <br />
Sean gag the memories he saw when he first got into this body, and glad he was the new <br />
owner of it so it could get use. Sean even learned that through experimenting during the <br />
summer with the jockstrap and Chris's body he could take off the jockstrap and show off <br />
for at least 30 min before he would be removed from Chris's body, but than it was just <br />
waiting till Chris left his jock somewhere that Sean could take it back over. Well that wasn't <br />
really gonna happen anymore since Sean was gonna stay in this body forever. <br />
Sean began strutting back to his locker when he noticed he couldn't find his clothes and <br />
more importantly his jockstrap, &quot;Fuck&quot; the only words he could say while he was looking <br />
for his jock &quot;If I can't find this shit I am gonna get kicked out, and there are way to many <br />
freaking students now that class is back, I AM NOT GIVING THIS BODY UP&quot; he looked <br />
around as much as he could but his time was up. From Chris's back a smaller form <br />
erupted, being ejected from his body with force. Chris just fell down, the smaller form <br />
behind him just grabbing a towel and getting out of there before anyone saw him. Chris <br />
just stood up and looked around him, like he was in a daze that he just got out of. He saw <br />
himself nude and felt shy about the whole thing, he grabbed a towel he spotted and went <br />
to his office that was connected to the locker room and hoped he could find some extra <br />
clothes.<br />
At this point the locker room was not abandoned, except for one hidden figure that heard <br />
and saw everything, even where the clothes were hidden.</p>
