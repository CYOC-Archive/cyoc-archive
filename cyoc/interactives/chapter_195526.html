<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now, Jack was nothing if not an athletic young man, and had built up quite a bit of a body over the course of his experience - having been working out since he was 12 with his dad&#39;s fitness weights. So while eager to experience some of the &quot;other side of the tracks&quot;, he wasn&#39;t going to just fully discard his masculinity. <br />
<br />
This was his first real vacation on his own, but he was confident in his ability to handle himself. 16 and on his own, Jack was confident he was able to deal with whatever went on here. He had heard some odd stories from former goers, but a real, transformative experience? He had to check that out! Though he wasn&#39;t exactly quick to just cast aside everything he had already.<br />
<br />
As Jack concentrated he felt a very peculiar sensation flowing over him. It was amazing that this place could just do this so easily. Not to mention how good it felt. Almost like receiving a full body massage. He would&#39;ve thought getting his gender so altered would hurt or something. It seemed like a fairly momentous change!<br />
<br />
The light bit of stubble, uneven on his face, slowly began to recede - leaving Jack smooth-faced...and increasingly more feminine. His lips seemed slightly more plump, leaving him grinning as he lightly bit his lower lip. His features becoming finer, more pretty and slightly less masculine. A few hints at a heart-shaped, effeminate look started showing on his features - his hair just as well growing from male presenting short cut to a more androgynous trending on femme longer cut. The hair color in question lightening to between blond and brown.<br />
<br />
Jack&#39;s pecs retained elements of their strength even as his shoulders slightly narrowed and his breasts began to grow. &quot;Ohh yeah, I always wondered what having my own rack would feel like...&quot; Jack grinned lecherously as he felt his new breasts up as they grew out. Not overwhelmingly large, but more just enough to make an impression. He looked down at his hands and saw his fingers becoming thinner, his palms growing softer - his skin all around seemed to be trending softer, increasingly hairless.<br />
<br />
Jack&#39;s abs remained - he was not getting rid of those under any circumstance. He flexed them and chuckled as he watched his hips swell with size, straining his pants and prompting Jack to push them down. He could watch with eager eyes as he saw his glutes swell, growing from the somewhat flat if slightly muscular contours into a more appealing feminine form.<br />
<br />
He groaned as he felt his thighs growing larger, his muscles there if anything accentuating more from the shift in his sex. Several grunts flew rapid fire from Jack&#39;s mouth as he registered his manhood wedged between his sizable, feminine thighs. Still clothed under an increasingly strained pair of boxers, Jack chuckled as he saw how erect he was right now. &quot;Ohh yeah...this feels...wait...my voice...?&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed his Adam&#39;s Apple was smaller and much less prominent than usual. Not quite disappearing, but becoming barely visible. And owing to this, his voice had changed from the masculine deep if wavering tone of a young man on the verge of true adulthood to the androgynous tone of someone not quite male but not quite wholly female either. &quot;Wow, my voice sounds so different now. I&#39;m...I sound so freaking girly!&quot; <br />
<br />
He giggled to himself at the idea, not thinking of the oddity of that. He suddenly felt something between his legs though, which cut off his giggle with a gasp and an intrigued whisper at what might&#39;ve gone on there. He could feel it though - Jack could feel something changing down there. Though his manhood did not disappear - rather, it merely shrunk about an inch and lost most of the hair surrounding it - he could feel underneath his balls, which seemed to themselves shift a bit, that something was unusual.<br />
<br />
A light touch informed him of a new, wet entry point just under his balls, a new sex organ that promised him some new forms of enjoyment. Jack grinned - on top of having his own breasts to play with, he had his own pussy now as well. His girlfriend all too often had been too busy to let him have sex as much as he wanted. Now he could experience it on his own.<br />
<br />
By the time the changes were done, Jack could now observe the whole effect of his decision. He was still male in his mind, in his identity, but now he could explore sex and sexuality from a whole different lens and experience. &quot;Whew...man,&quot; Jack whistled as he took in everything. He flexed an arm, watching a muscular bicep surge up - skin was softer, but his muscles seemed just about at what he expected from before. Maybe a tiny bit thinner, but definitely toned and impressive.<br />
<br />
Impressive was also a word for his chest. &quot;Heh,&quot; Jack murmured to himself, &quot;I think I got a better pair of breasts than most of the girls back at school.&quot; He resisted the urge to play with them here and now. He had a whole vacation experience to undergo. People to see, experiences to be had. So on and so forth. He was honestly pretty excited to see how this would affect his time here. Maybe he could see if some of the cute ladies he saw going in might be amenable to going with him now.<br />
<br />
Getting dressed again and adjusting for his new features, Jack still presented himself clothing wise in a masculine way, though his t-shirt he put on from his luggage left his new breasts clear through the fabric. Nipples pushing out through. His larger pair of pants now both showed his appealing booty and a hint at his manhood. &quot;Well, better go and see what I can do here.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Jack headed out to enjoy himself.</p>
