<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of Saturday continued mostly as normal, despite Dan feeling way more hornier than usual, constantly eating from his accelerated metabolism and was spending the remainder of the day pants-less. He had tried to put on some underwear after breakfast, but they felt very uncomfortable as his two baseball sized testicles could barely fit in the brief&#39;s front pouch. Andrew was very amused and suggested they go out for larger pants tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The next morning Dan freaks out when he finds two melon sized balls between his legs. &quot;Oh shit,&quot; Dan curses, &quot;Andrew you&#39;re going to want to kill me.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Andrew asks half asleep as he stirs, then his eyes widen as he spies his boyfriend&#39;s massive balls.<br />
Dan gets up and feels the weight of his two ball hanging heavy and low between his legs, stretching his sack as they reach his knees.<br />
&quot;Eghhh they&#39;re so heavy. How am I going to walk with these?&quot;<br />
Andrew stares at his naked boyfriend standing naked in the mirror, his 7 inch dick rock hard and two melons in a sack lightly swinging between his legs. <br />
*Jeez! I bet he wishes his cock was growing instead of them, it&#39;s startling to look smaller in comparison* Andrew thought before jokingly stating &quot;I think they suit you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not funny.&quot; Dan growled.<br />
&quot;You really should contact someone involved with the trail Dan, maybe they can tell you what&#39;s going on. You might be allergic or something and they help.&quot;<br />
&quot;I tried last night,&quot; Dan sighed, &quot;But all I got back was an automatic email reply reminding me to wait until the end of the month to send my data. I don&#39;t have any other way to contact them until then.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can they even reverse this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t scare me babe, of course they can, just got to wait until they find my email, and I bet they’ll send something to help&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, ok. Get back into bed and I&#39;ll bring in breakfast, then we should probably head over to the mall to find you some pants that will fit. Can&#39;t have you pants-less the whole time.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;m not going out like this? How would I even hid them?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well you were the one who took the second pill! We have to find something that fits and that means I need you there too.&quot;<br />
The argument continued during breakfast until Dan finally gave in. <br />
&quot;Fine, what should I wear to the mall then?<br />
Andrew smirked and pulled out a fanny pack. &quot;I&#39;ve cut the back out of it. Should fit your nuts nicely&quot; he mused.<br />
&quot;You gotta be kidding&quot; Dan groaned.<br />
<br />
Dan put on some baggy track pants, looking at the large bulge half way down one of the legs, yip there was no way people wouldn&#39;t notice if he just went like this. He lifted his balls over the elastic band and placed them in the fanny pack strapped to this waist. It looks ridiculous but at least no one would notice his oversized testicles. He felt super horny, like his nuts were at capacity and needed release, but Andrew was ready to leave so he&#39;ll just have to wait.<br />
<br />
It had been an hour at the mall picking out large underwear that might fit, and Andrew contemplating whether he should just buy fabric to make custom pants, before Dan had enough. He was way too turned on and really needed release so he grabbed Andrew and dragged him into the nearest changing room. He pulled down Andrews pants as he passionately made out with him, Andrew, enjoying the kinkiness of the public location didn&#39;t resist. Next Dan ripped off the fanny pack and let his own pants drop, winching as his heavy balls fell to they natural resting place caused by unforgiving gravity. His rock hard cock already pouring with precum naturally lubed up Andrews ass and he thrust it in. Andrew started moaning from the pleasure so Dan covered his mouth with his hand. Soon Dan was ready to burst, feeling a swelling in his nuts. A gust of cum ejaculates from his cock into Andrew, the force of it pumping deep within him. The pressure of the vast amount of cum entering Andrew&#39;s ass was too much for him causing Andrew to cum too, squirting against the changing room mirror. Finally Dan&#39;s balls heave the last shot of cum into his bf before they stop and lean against the wall panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh jeez! What am I going to do with this babes?!&quot; Andrew said after the ecstasy of his orgasm wore off. He pointed down to his belly, where Dan saw his nice abs had bloated into a round belly, jutting out from under his shirt like a hidden flesh watermelon.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all your cum inside me dude. I don&#39;t know how I could stretch out so much, but oh it feels tight.&quot;<br />
Surprised, Dan pulls out his still hard cock to unplug his lover&#39;s hole but nothing leaks out. He gets his head closer to Andrews swollen belly and presses a hand against it. It felt firm, but he could hear a liquid lightly sloshing around inside.<br />
<br />
Before Dan could comment, there was a knocking at the door. &quot;Hello? You still changing in there sir? There is a line.&quot;<br />
Panicked Andrew replied, &quot;Ah yes leaving in one sec&quot; as he wiped down the mirror with his sleeve.<br />
They quickly started pulling up their pants, Dan hiding his balls back in the fanny pack, and sheepishly leave the changing room. There were at least four people looking at them, most cross for waiting. Eyes often darting down to Andrews stomach that was jutting out from his shirt, as if he was wearing one way too small for him. Not wasting any time, the couple bought the stuff they had and quickly went home.<br />
<br />
That afternoon, after a massive meal Andrew cooked for his ravenous boyfriend, Dan as still horny so decided to see how much cum his body was producing. Naked in the kitchen he had a wank, aiming into their biggest measuring jug.<br />
&quot;Dude I came about 1000mls, nearly 5Cups!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ughhh no wonder I feel so bloated, I still haven&#39;t been able to shit any of it out yet&quot; Andrew said slightly grumpy, as he pats his round stomach. &quot;I still can hear it sloshing around in there as I walk around too, cum ain&#39;t meant to be so liquid-like either.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Andrew lay in bed, laying on his side like a pregnant woman, Dan looked at the container of pills. He still needed to keep taking these things or he would be in deep trouble, but could he handle being even bigger? He did enjoy himself today, and was enjoying being toned again. *Ah what the hell* he thought as he took another pill, knowing full well his balls would probably be twice as big again in the morning.</p>
