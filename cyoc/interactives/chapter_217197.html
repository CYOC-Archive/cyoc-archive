<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Riley calls the principals office, Jeff suddenly feels the need to pee, ‘man… I really need to go,’ he thinks to himself, Jeff then looks up at Riley, “R-Riley,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Riley looks down at Jeff, “what’s the matter, River,” the boy asks, Jeff grimaces when Riley, once again calls him “River” instead of “Jeff”. It feels so weird but also right, in this reality Jeff isn’t “Jeff” but “River”… Riley’s dog. Jeff shakes his head, “I… I need to… I need to pee,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Then go ahead,” Riley simply says, “I’m not stopping you, if you need to go, then go”.<br />
<br />
Jeff gets to his feet, but as he straightens himself, a weird feeling of discomfort washes over him, standing on two legs, which should be normal, suddenly feels wrong to Jeff. The teen again shakes his head, he then starts to walk, the feeling becoming stronger. Jeff tries to ignore the feeling and concentrate on getting to a toilette, but instead of heading into the building, the teen heads towards a tree nearby. When Jeff reaches the tree, he gets down on his hands, immediately, the feeling of discomfort subsides, being on all fours suddenly feels right to Jeff. Jeff then starts to sniff at the trunk of the tree, not noticing Riley watching him, a smirk on the younger teen’s face. The 16 year-old then lifts his right leg and pees on the bark of the tree, after finishing peeing, Jeff, still on all fours, clumsily walks around a little, sniffing at the grass, bench and tree on which he just peed. Walking on his hands and feet, his butt sticking up into the sky, feels awkward and uncomfortable to Jeff, even though it feels right, ‘man… I wish walking would not be so uncomfortable,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I know I shouldn’t be walking like this… but… it feels so right being on all fours. This is so humiliating and embarrassing’. As he continues to sniff around, Jeff feels overwhelmed by all the smells and information’s his new senses are giving him: he knows what person or animal has been standing or sitting in the spot. After a while, Jeff feels the need to poop, so he lowers his butt to the ground, spreads his legs and poops, after finishing, Jeff turns around and looks at his own poop. The sight of the huge pile for some reason fills him with pride, Jeff shakes his head, ‘this is so fucked up,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I hope Riley is right, and everything will be back to normal soon’. Jeff then simply decides to head back to Riley, as he returns, Riley is just ending the call.<br />
<br />
After Riley hangs up and puts his phone away, he looks down at Jeff and smiles, “River, you really are one cute dog,” he says, then chuckles when Jeff blushes, “I mean it, seriously,” he then says, ruffling Jeff’s hair.<br />
<br />
“Yo, Riley,” they then hear a voice call, when they look they see a 13 year-old boy with short blond hair walking down the stairs, carrying Riley’s backpack, “I was sent to give you your stuff”.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles and takes his stuff from the boy, “thanks, Brandon,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Brandon smiles back, “no problemo, homie,” he says, then he looks down at Jeff, “you know, River is one cute pup. He’ll grow up to be a great guard dog, I am sure of it”.<br />
<br />
Riley looks at Jeff, Jeff looks back up at Riley, “if you say so, Brandon,” Riley says, “but he is still so young and needs lots of training”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen in shock, “I don’t like the sound of that,” he says.<br />
<br />
Brandon chuckles, “I can tell,” he says, “he sure is a lively little critter. But, with the right training and right obedience school, it will most certainly work out. Have you found an obedience school yet?”<br />
<br />
Riley looks at Brandon, “no, I haven’t gotten around to it,” he says, “besides: I just got River, like, a day ago. I also still need to take him to the Vets and get a collar, leash and all sorts of stuff he needs”.<br />
<br />
“NO! Nonononono,” Jeff says, “you are NOT taking me to the Vets!”<br />
<br />
Riley kneels down, “listen, River,” he says, “there is no need to be afraid. I promise nothing bad will happen. I promise, everything will be fine, just trust me, okay?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grumbles, then he lets out a sigh and nods, “okay… fine,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Wow, at least he is already obeying you,” Brandon says, “smart pup. Anyway, I’d better get back to class. I’ll see you around”.<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Riley says, and after the two boys said their farewells, Riley turns to Jeff, “okay, River. Let’s get out of here. Come! Heel,” and after Riley stuffed Jeff’s clothes into his backpack, Riley starts to head towards the gates, Jeff follows at the boy’s side, walking clumsily on his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
As they start to head down the street, which leads to the town centre, Jeff at first feels so humiliated, still believing everyone will make fun of him and that he’ll get into trouble for being naked in public. But, as they continue down the streets, every single person they pass simply say stuff like, “what a cute puppy”, “may I stroke him?” and just simply acting normal, as if they don’t see a naked human teenager but a normal dog.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles down at Jeff, while he is being petted by an 8 year-old boy, “see? Told you you have nothing to worry about,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff, who is actually enjoying being stroked by the kid, lets out a sigh, “okay, okay,” he mumbles, “it’s still embarrassing none the less. Can… can we please keep moving?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Riley says, he then turns to the woman and child, “sorry, but we really need to get going”.<br />
<br />
The woman nods, “come Brian,” she says and takes the boy’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Aaaaw… b-but I wanna stroke tha doggo,” he says.<br />
<br />
The woman smiles, “you’ll see him more often. You can stroke him next time we meet”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the boy says.<br />
<br />
Riley chuckles, “you are really loved by everyone we met so far,” he says as they continue on their way.<br />
<br />
Jeff again lets out a sigh, “I… I wanted to ask you,” he says, “everyone is calling me a puppy, and you said earlier that I am supposed to be very young. How… how young am I in this reality?”<br />
<br />
“You are 8 weeks,” Riley says.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “THAT young? Bu-but… I am way to big! D-does that mean… I… I’ll be shrinking?” he asks, “man… wh-why is this person doing this to me? I don’t wanna be a baby dog… I don’t wanna be a dog at all!”<br />
<br />
Riley leans down and gives Jeff a scratch, “hey, relax,” he says, “at least you are not getting into any trouble for being naked. You even already look a little smaller and even a little younger than a few minutes ago”.<br />
<br />
Riley chuckles when Jeff scowls at him, “one more thing,” he says, “wh-what type of dog am I? Everyone, including you, said that with training I’ll make a great guard dog”.<br />
<br />
The 14 year-old smiles, “you are a Malinois, which is a short-haired Belgian shepherd, with golden Fawn, a black Saddle and black Mask”.<br />
<br />
“Soooo, in other words: I look just like a German Shepherd, only that my… fur… is shorter,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Riley says, “you like the sound of that?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “it… it does sound kinda nice,” he says.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles, ‘this is so cool,’ he thinks to himself, ‘man… this App really has strong power! Hehe… I can’t wait to try out more’.<br />
<br />
After a while, Jeff starts to groan, “man… walking like this is really uncomfortable,” he says, “m-my body is shaped wrong for being on all fours”.<br />
<br />
“Well, why aren’t you walking like a human,” Riley asks, “I haven’t told you to walk on all fours like a dog”.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes, “I… it is just…,” he stutters, he then lets out a grumble, “it… it just feels wrong walking on two legs. It… it feels right being on all fours…”.<br />
<br />
Riley shrugs, “well, if it feels right then stop complaining,” he says, “you’ll get used to it. Maybe… just maybe, your body will change into the “correct” shape”.<br />
<br />
“Th-that actually would make walking like this so much easier and much more comfortable,” Jeff mumbles, “I wi… OW! MY FEET AND HANDS,” he suddenly yells, as his hands and feet suddenly cramp, causing Jeff to fall onto his side, screaming in pain. People stop and stare at the “yowling dog”, tears start to roll from his eyes.<br />
<br />
“RIVER,” Riley yells, acting shocked and worried, as he kneels down, “what… what’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“M-my feet… and… ha-hands…,” Jeff sobs, “th-they su-suddenly started… cr-cramping! It… it hurts so bad!”<br />
<br />
Riley looks closer and then lets out a gasp of surprise, “River, your feet and hands… they… they are staring to look like paws,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down at his hands, his eyes widen as he watches all of his fingers become stubby, his nails becoming long black claws as pads appear on his palm and fingers. He looks at his feet, they too now resemble padded paws, Jeff watches his heel lengthen as the cramp travels up his legs. The teen’s eyes widen in horror as he watches his legs change shape, becoming digitigrade, like a dog’s. Then the cramp suddenly stops, just as sudden as it started, “I… I think it’s over,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Let me help you to your feet… I mean… paws,” Riley says, he heaves Jeff onto his new paws, “how… how are you feeling,” he asks, he then hears Jeff’s back pop and Jeff lets out a yelp, “um… did… did your back just pop?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I… I feel fine,” he says, “and… yeah… my back popped, I guess… I guess it means I am locked… trapped in this position”.<br />
<br />
“Try walking,” Riley says, “take it slow”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, he then takes a few careful steps, at first he staggers and trips over himself, but soon he gets the hang of it. The teen walks around Riley, slowly at first, but soon he starts to walk faster, which turns into a jog and finally into a run. After running a few rounds around Riley, Jeff stops in front of the boy and looks up, “man… I… I hate to admit it,” he says, “but… it feels… great! I am so freaking fast! Much faster than I was when I was still on two legs… it… it feels AMAZING!”<br />
<br />
Riley smiles, “glad you are feeling better,” he says, he then turns to the audience that gathered around them, “what’s up with you? Haven’t you got places to go,” he asks the crowed, which silently then start to walk off. Riley then turns back to Jeff, who lowers his head, the 14 year-old kneels down, “hey, what’s the matter, River?”<br />
<br />
“I… I’m sorry,” Jeff mumbles, “I… I didn’t mean to cause a scene”.<br />
<br />
“River,” Riley says calmly, stroking Jeff’s head, “you do not have to apologize. It is not your fault”.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at Riley, who is smiling down at him, seeing this causes Jeff to feel the urge to lick the boy’s face, and before he can stop himself, he jumps up and knocks Riley onto his back, causing the boy to let out a “oof” as he starts licking his face.<br />
<br />
Riley is taken by surprise, but when Jeff starts licking him, he can’t help but start to laugh, “HE-HEY… RIVER… HAHAHA… ST-STOP IT… HAHA…,” he laughs and after some pushing and struggling, manages to free himself. When Riley gets to his feet he looks down at Jeff, who is waggling his butt wildly and panting, seeming happy that Riley is not mad at him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jeff stops, his eyes widen when he realizes what he had just done, “oh… fuck… s-sorry,” he says.<br />
<br />
Riley just chuckles as he wipes his face from spit, “all good, River,” he says, smiling, “I guess your instincts took control there for a second. Don’t worry, I am NOT grossed out, you are my dog… for now, and it is natural for a dog to lick its master, especially if it is a happy pooch”. Riley ruffles Jeff’s head, which causes Jeff to waggle his butt a little, the 14 year-old smiles, “let’s get the shopping done so that we can head home. Come, River, heel,” with that both continue on their way.<br />
<br />
They soon arrive at the pet store and after almost an hour, Riley bought two bowls, a big comfy dog bed, a cool black and white collar, a matching leash, some doggy treats, some poop bags, some toys and some dog food. Realizing that he is unable to carry everything back home, Riley arranges with the clerk for the stuff to be delivered.<br />
<br />
After paying everything, Riley grabs the collar and Jeff lets the boy place it around his neck and fasten the leash. “Looking good, River,” he says, smiling, “it really suits you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels so humiliated, “it… it feels so weird,” he mumbles, “wearing a collar and being on a leash. I feel so humiliated… but also, in a strange way, proud. This is so messed up”.<br />
<br />
Riley ruffles Jeff’s hair, “you’ll get used to it, River,” he says, “now, let’s get you home. I bet you want to see your new home, for the time you are my dog”.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… I guess,” Jeff says, so they head out the store and start to walk back up the street. When they pass by a window, Jeff catches a glimpse of himself, he stops and stares at his reflection, causing Riley to jerk back.<br />
<br />
“He-hey, what why… oh,” he says, when realizing why Jeff had stopped, Riley smiles, “so, what do you think?”<br />
<br />
“I… I look so weird,” Jeff says, “like some kind of… misscariage… BUT… I do kinda like the collar… it does kinda suit me”.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles, “glad you like the collar,” he says, “and don’t worry, I have a feeling that your body will continue to change until it’s 100% dog. Now, let’s get home, I’m tired and hungry, and I believe so are you”.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah…,” Jeff says, “though… I am not looking forward to having to eat dog food,” he says and wrinkles his nose.<br />
<br />
Riley chuckles, “you might enjoy it,” he says, “I promise: if you hate it I’ll make you some human food, deal?”<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a bark and nods his head, “YES!”<br />
<br />
Riley chuckles, “then, let’s get going,” he says and they continue on their way.</p>
