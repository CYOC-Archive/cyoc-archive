<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Heck this is massive. Thanks to Rawr7 inspiring me.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Give me a some time to come up with something,” Simon smiled at Mister E’s frozen featureless face, swiveling his head to look at the room where a ton of expensive looking costume pieces were his to use tonight. &quot;It would be a while though, how much time do I have?&quot;<br />
<br />
“About an hour before we begin,&quot; Mister E&#39;s emotionless mask conveyed no emotion nor did his voice. &quot;But of course. I’ll be greeting the new arrivals if you need me,” he tipped his head and headed back into the next room.<br />
<br />
Alright, an hour is enough time. What was he going to wear? He was still a little unsure about this whole masquerade thing. What if he did hit it off with someone? Make a connection and actually maintain it? They’d just be playing a character. He’s have to ask for their number and go out for coffee later to meet the real person behind the mask.<br />
<br />
Ugh, tonight was getting complicated.<br />
<br />
First things first was a mask, a stereotypical masquerade mask went on his face taken from the nearby card table. Thankfully their host had set up a small mirror in the room. It looked… fine? He’d picked one with minimal flair. He could deal with it for the night, but something about it just wasn’t clicking.<br />
<br />
Did he want to play it safe? Wear the minimal and have no story at all.<br />
<br />
Or go as Clark expected him to, and embrace the whole thing?<br />
<br />
Simon was still hesitant to go buck-wild with all the things in here, they seemed expensive as all hell. As a dead end job worker earning minimum wage and having a degree no one cared for in game design, breaking these costumes could have him in deep shit.<br />
<br />
He walked back to the next room over and turned the corner only to bump into the lanky butler&#39;s back. &quot;Ooof!&quot; <br />
<br />
Simon backed away from the surprisingly immovable butler. Weird. &quot;Sorry, Mr E.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Mister E, and I don&#39;t see you&#39;ve done any choices?&quot; Mister E didn&#39;t have anger in his voice, the tone more confusion than ire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I just have a question,&quot; Simon rubbed the back of his head unsure. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I can use the costumes, I can&#39;t pay for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister E tilted his head, but Simon had no clue whether it was confusion or a sinister smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense! All the costumes in there is anyone&#39;s for the taking.&quot; The lanky butler straightened back up. &quot;All in good will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, okay. I&#39;ll try to come up with something.&quot; Simon nodded and backed away as Mister E returned to greeting more guests already in full costume. What they wore fit the whole event, some with partial masks but fully dressed for the part, while some fully hid their faces.<br />
<br />
He could feel their eagerness to give this masquerade their all, laughing as they walked in and having fun.<br />
<br />
Why shouldn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
Once again he was back into the room with costumes and Halloween paraphernalia he could only wish to window shop. All of it up for grabs, because he was given permission to go wild.<br />
<br />
The glint of the gold bull-size nose ring caught his eyes, the circular metal split to allow clipping sitting clean as if brand new within its box of red foam. Above the box was a stand holding the impressive ivory horns of a strong bull. It seems to be worn as a pair most likely.<br />
<br />
He could see the outfits hanging on clothe racks fitting many themes. There was a fully kitted butler suit, a striped business suit, a regal king&#39;s high garb, a set of plaid shirt and cotton trousers with suspenders. There was a lot to survey that he couldn&#39;t list all of it.<br />
<br />
But if he was going to stick with Clark, he would need to be at least equal in thematic.<br />
<br />
There was a trunk that he noticed in the room which he approached. As he opened the trunk, he could clearly see a ton of masks made of latex foam sitting inside plastic wrappings. The first that he saw was a goat prosthetic, but he moved it aside to search deeper. <br />
<br />
They were colorless which meant that if he was to use them, he&#39;d have to take some time to paint them. He glanced around and just as easily noticed the high quality art supplies sitting on a shelf.<br />
<br />
There was more that he noted that he could use. A lion mask that had a faux mane, a big feline if he wanted to pair with Clark&#39;s Tabby Cheshire Cat theme. He considered it, but he didn&#39;t want to overthrow Prince Chesh.<br />
<br />
Simon chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;d roleplay as his dad, King Leon or something.&quot; He remarked as he put the lion mask aside.<br />
<br />
In his heart, he was set to play his part and probably stand out with being unique. If what Clark said was true then someone would find his uniqueness enticing. Maybe instead of floundering around looking for someone to click, they&#39;d do the job for him and approach him instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, quite a lot to choose here. I wonder-&quot; <br />
<br />
He pulled out a fitting mask to wear with the bull-sized golden nose ring and the large horns, but somehow being a minotaur just isn&#39;t what he wanted to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, well, kinda boring.&quot; He glanced to the obvious minotaur set and pushed the mask aside shaking his head. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Many more went out, the many breeds of dogs being tossed out alongside the birds with their big beaks. He wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted a big nose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, what&#39;s this?&quot; Simon said as he pulled out a wolf latex foam mask. This one was far better quality to the generic Etsy wolf mask he had at home that he didn&#39;t dare to bring to a masquerade. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think... I&#39;m comfortable with this.&quot; Simon nodded as he packed back the many masks into the trunk, walking over to the art supplies to begin doing a simple paint job. <br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed bodysuits hanging on racks. Their skin-tone coloration briefly scaring him that he was looking at real skin. It looked so real...<br />
<br />
Curiosity peaked, he walked over to the collections of bodysuits. As more of them were revealed, it was easy to see that they were meticulous in selection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew... all of these I can just use? Perks of being rich I guess...&quot; He looked over the body types. There were inclusive of plus size and lanky, but he had his eyes set of one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always wanted to be one of those studs... They seem to be sexual magnets...&quot; He picked out one that had a tan complexion, a far cry to his own light tan looks.<br />
<br />
With the wolf mask in hand and a bodysuit with muscle definition of an obsessed gym goer, Simon went to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Been 20 minutes huh,&quot; Simon remarked as he looked to his plastic watch. He saw a set of watches in the accessory section that he could borrow. &quot;... better get to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wanted a sophisticated look while being easy on the eyes. Moderation is key, but he wanted to stand equal with Prince Chesh. <br />
<br />
The concept of a Wolf of Wall Street struck him as inspiration, and he picked out a black suit belonging to those of successful businessmen. <br />
<br />
If no one was going to be themselves this night, then he didn&#39;t have to be Simon the wageworker.<br />
<br />
His phone pinged. He shuffled to get it out and read that it was from Clark.<br />
<br />
<em> [Are you done yet? I don&#39;t see you.] </em><br />
<br />
He sighed with a smile and replied. [Be there in about 30 minutes more or less.]<br />
<br />
... <em> [Cutting it close but I&#39;ll be by the patio outside.] </em><br />
<br />
[&#128077;] Send.<br />
<br />
Simon exhaled a long breath. He was going to make it simple but unique. <br />
<br />
&quot;30 minutes, let&#39;s get it done faster than that.&quot; He rolled up his sleeves to his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Painting the wolf mask midnight black, adding grey furs to parts of the mask to make it look fluffier and animated with eyebrows and even a goatee. He wanted to look like an established man in his prime. A dream life he could live tonight.<br />
<br />
20 Minutes Left.<br />
<br />
Simon undressed out of everything leaving only his underwear on. He felt conscious if anyone was peering in, looked at the entrance for a second. Then his anxiety kicked in about soiling this suit with his sweat. Glancing around, he found a full spandex suit he could first put on as a barrier.<br />
<br />
The muscle suit slid on his form much easier when there was no friction between his spandex-covered skin and the suit&#39;s rubbery interior. No chafing for him tonight. He zipped up the back easily, walked to the mirror to ogle himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck... I look hot in this...&quot; After a few seconds as his blood rushed, he pursed his lips feeling his body heat up. &quot;Okay, okay. Not now.&quot; <br />
<br />
But now he felt naked, the muscle suit having no underwear. He looked around and found something out of place in such a grand collection. <br />
<br />
A jockstrap sitting in a dark corner. He didn&#39;t have the luxury of time to go searching for crotch-wear and picked it up, it had a large pouch for a large tool. It was a bit stained as if someone like a hardcore jock wore it and just left it here, but it had no smell or bad texture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever goes.&quot; He slipped it onto his fake muscular crotch. It snapped fittingly in place. He took his old socks from his shoes and rolled them into the form fitting for the pouch and stuffed it in, the cylindrical roll of his socks filling his pouch with an upward phallus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, looking alive there.&quot; He nodded at his work and saw that he only had another 10 minutes left with a grace period of another 10 minutes. By this time the paint and glue on his mask were already dried, he only had to wear his business apparel. A characterization from his Wolf of Wall Street forming in his mind.<br />
<br />
He multitasked wearing his new suit along with fancy black leather shoes he found on a nearby shelf, socks included, and clipped his buttons and tightened his belt. He wore a fancy silver watch, anathema to werewolves but he loved the dichotomy and irony. The black leather gloves hiding any sense of him being human.<br />
<br />
Walking in front of the mirror, Simon was impressed. The multi-layer suit he wore made him look taller and more muscular than he really was. He was truly embracing faking a new character that wasn&#39;t physically himself. With his normal head on the buff man he was envisioning himself to be, he slid on the wolf mask over his head.<br />
<br />
He...<br />
<br />
He had no words. He was entirely a new person in the mirror as he stood with a hunch. He straightened himself and puffed his chest. He looked amazing.<br />
<br />
He posed, shown off his silver watch, the latex foam mask showing off deeply intelligent eyes, thankful that it didn&#39;t cover his warm browns that shined.<br />
<br />
He could see that his time was up, he needed to hurry and meet up with Clark. Or rather, Prince Chesh in 10 minutes now!<br />
<br />
He stored his old clothes into a cubicle and put his personal belongings into his pockets, walking towards the exit now. He passed by the bull-sized nose ring and its horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Simon paused and considered it.<br />
<br />
No question, do it or don&#39;t, time was running out.<br />
<br />
He picked up the headbands with the horns and the nose ring, walked to the mirror, and clipped the gold ring to his latex foam wolf mask&#39;s snout. Just as quickly he put on the headband over his head fitting the root of the horns behind his wolfish fake ears and extending over it to point directly forwards. <br />
<br />
A quick glance over his form and Simon was satisfied. He mixed up quite a concept that hopefully people here found unique. Wolf of Wall Street, Minotaur Beefcake. <br />
<br />
He exited the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope I&#39;m not late!&quot; Simon said out loud from inside his mask as he approached the next room over. &quot;Mister E! I&#39;m good to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon quite literally rushed and stopped when the lanky host turned around to meet him with his frozen facial mask. &quot;Oh, quite the overachiever here I see! Great to see you embracing this masquerade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I hope to enjoy my night here.&quot; Simon chuckled as he rubbed the back of his thick neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you will.&quot; Mister E said with finality. He leaned in enough to be at eye level with Simon&#39;s form. &quot;So... who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon blinked. He had the concept in his mind. &quot;I&#39;m... a hybrid of the Wolf of Wall Street literally, and- uh, a Minotaur Beefcake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister E tilted his head while leaned down. &quot;What about your name?&quot; <br />
<br />
Simon blinked a second time. He was so hung up on the concept, he forgot the name. &quot;Uh, one second.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My, this <em>is</em> your first time.&quot; The host chuckled with no maliciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know exactly what to do, but uh... maybe... Silvester.&quot; Simon put forth since it was at least two alphabets that started with his real name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Silvester? Having a last name would help.&quot; Mister E suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, I think I want my name to express kindness.&quot; Simon considered what Mister E said. With resolution, he inhaled and exhaled the name. &quot;Silvester Justus.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t see if Mister E smiled but a hand reached out for a handshake. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to host you in my masquerade, Silvester Justus.&quot; <br />
<br />
Simon nodded, since he couldn&#39;t exactly smile as he shook it firmly and let go. &quot;Thanks, it&#39;s my pleasure to join my friend Clark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, the royalty Prince Chesh. The both of you have fun.&quot; Mister E showed the way as he moved aside. Simon nodded and walked into the house.<br />
<br />
He wandered the giant mansion and noted that he didn&#39;t feel discomfort in this whole get up. He slumped as he relaxed, no longer trying to be so uptight. <br />
<br />
His phone buzzed. It was audible even through the music coming out of the speakers he couldn&#39;t see. The sound soft enough to not be overwhelming yet loud enough to be heard clearly.<br />
<br />
<em>[Dude, where are you? There&#39;s literally almost no time left!]</em><br />
<br />
Simon thankfully had gloves mode on for his phone. He replied. [I&#39;m in, full get up. Why?]<br />
<br />
<em>... [There&#39;s something I gotta share with you. Come meet me, don&#39;t be in character yet!] </em><br />
<br />
Simon left him on read as he walked faster. Patio was where he was supposed to meet Clark. <br />
<br />
As he walked, he could note that the place was full of masked people in their characters. Most of them looked like they bought their costumes from high end costume stores, but he could spot those that were on a budget as well.<br />
<br />
It relieved him that he at least could fake being rich and not be heavily scrutinized. <br />
<br />
As he walked past the grand ball room where many guests talked, Simon noted the spiraling staircases that was made of pure white marble. Guests in masks were walking up to the second floor where he couldn&#39;t see much, and he didn&#39;t really know where the patio was.<br />
<br />
He approached a butler looking guest with a doberman dog mask on his face and awkwardly asked. &quot;Hey... can I know the direction to the patio?&quot;<br />
<br />
He could see the eyebrow raised at his meekness. He didn&#39;t push on it thankfully as he gestured to the south. &quot;Follow this hallway to the end and take a left. You should be able to see the glass doors that lead outside. That&#39;s one of the closest patio.&quot; <br />
<br />
Simon nodded and waved as he quickly walked. &quot;Thanks man.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the open doors he could see many rooms in the mansion being open for guests. He walked by a room and was taken aback at the massive theater room that had some guests sitting in the seats browsing their phones. The plush black seats was almost hard to see and only the golden light by the side stairs were what made out the silhouette of the seats.<br />
<br />
The hallways had crystal chandeliers hanging with golden lights overhead, bathing the mansion in an aura of richness. The red carpeting he was walking on with shoes on didn&#39;t leave any footprints as he walked.<br />
<br />
Soon enough he reached the patio, and walked outside. <br />
<br />
Simon could see the many tables surrounding a massive pool glowing blue with the lights inside the water, casting the reflections of water onto the nearby walls. <br />
<br />
Many guests didn&#39;t go into the waters however, since the party wasn&#39;t started nor was there any desire to ruin their costumes.<br />
<br />
Simon could not find Clark as easily however. He took out his phone and began typing. [Dude, where are you?]<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
... <em> [I&#39;m at the table behind the plants to your left.] </em><br />
<br />
Simon looked over and saw the tree and plants and walked over, finding Clark sat at a marble table with a lantern on it. Walking with a quickened pace, he reached there and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clark! I made this myself,&quot; Simon splayed himself wide and proudly. &quot;I know you liked big guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
If the cheshire cat wasn&#39;t masked, the blush probably would be visible. &quot;Simon! Come on, don&#39;t say that yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Simon was confused at the reason for the timing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the masquerade takes characterization seriously.&quot; Clark explained as he gestured to himself. &quot;I am Prince Chesh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Simon replied as he said his character&#39;s name. &quot;And I&#39;m Silvester Justus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? And by the get up I can guess Wolf of Wall Street?&quot; Clark smirked at him. &quot;Obvious, but the minotaur touches are new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last minute changes really.&quot; Simon chuckled through his mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here&#39;s the best thing about this party you don&#39;t know, but you gotta be warned about.&quot; Clark said in a serious tone. &quot;This is your first time as I am, but I read up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? Come on man.&quot; Simon asked exasperated. Not only was he brought along, he did a lot to enjoy the night. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here&#39;s the fact. Stay in character and keep what you say as if it&#39;s the truth about yourself over the next few hours.&quot; Clark stated matter of factly. &quot;Stay consistent or things can get really wacky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I mean I have my concept, but not the full characterization.&quot; Simon replied as he thought over his concept. &quot;It has a lot of open interpretation that I can use to build on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For sure, but that&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m a prince so it&#39;s easy, what are you?&quot; Clark asked as he looked over at his watch, a gasp escaped his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I-&quot; He was cut off as a bell rang. Everyone looked over to where the sound was coming from as the massive window that showed Mister E on a stage.<br />
<br />
His mask reflected the golden lights cast from the golden chandeliers high above, glinting and shining.<br />
<br />
&quot;The time has come for the masquerade to begin! Guests have arrived, while some couldn&#39;t make it the events will continue on!&quot; Mister E brought his arms to the air as he looked over the guests in masks. &quot;For those who are returning to this masquerade, welcome back! For those who are here for their very first time, welcome!&quot;<br />
<br />
The host continued as the people watched on, most of them smiling with excitement. Some were confused, like Simon was.<br />
<br />
&quot;To everyone, the first most important rule is to stay in character. It will benefit you as you meet people and participate in our contests and giveaways! Talk about yourself in character, and have fun! The best character vote will begin in three hours, the place to vote will be revealed once the time arrives. The winner will be announced as the clock strikes 12!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister E paused as he leaned to be closer to the guests, asking. &quot;Any questions folks?&quot;<br />
<br />
No one spoke up.<br />
<br />
Simon personally was confused, but no doubt he wants to be the center of attention asking it. Better let it go and discover himself. After a bit of time waited, Mister E spoke once more with finality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then with no questions asked, let The Masquerade . . . <b>begin</b>!&quot;</p>

What will Simon do tonight?</h3>
