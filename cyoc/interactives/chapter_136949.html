<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana turned off the camera and reactivated Mike&#39;s trigger. It was time for Phase Three. This was an optional part of the process that Mike was signed up for. This would involve using an advanced procedure to allow Mike partially transform into a dog. Mike was led into a fairly large and empty room. This was used as a observation area to hold the subjects who were undergoing transformation. Mike had his diaper changed into a new type that had a small space on the back specifically designed for the transformation. Mike was then given several shots and 4 different vials of medicine. Mike was  then woken up and fell down onto all fours. Diana and the two assistance that had helped her, left the room to observe the transformation.<br />
Mike felt strange. He was a good diaper dog, so why was he left alone in this empty room. Had he done something wrong? Was trainer mad at him? Before his  thoughts could go any further, Mike suddenly felt his legs and arms begin to change. They shifted suddenly and began to shorten. His fingers fused together, while his nails grew out into claws. His feet began to lengthen into back paws. While this was happening, thick fur began to sprout all over his body and a tail shot out of his diaper. The diaper&#39;s special modifications maintained the sealing of the diaper while allowing the tail to poke through. This sudden growth caused Mike to relieve himself, testing the diaper for himself. Shitting himself allowed Mike to bathe in pleasure. The changes slowed down as his ears moved to the top of his head and shifted into the shape of grey husky dog ears. Finally the changes stopped. Mike still mostly resembled a human. However his arms, legs, and ears looked like those of a grey husky dog. In addition to the fur and tail, Mike now looked like a human-dog hybrid. Mike panted showing of a long, dog-like tongue, his joy clearly displayed on his face.<br />
Once the transformation was complete, Diana returned to the room. She led the now transformed Mike to a new hypnosis room and strapped him in to the visor. Starting the program she left him there for about two hours. During this time, several special triggers were added and linked to Mike&#39;s collar. The collar could emit a wide variety of sounds humans were unable to hear. Mike&#39;s transformation would allow him to shift between human and dog forms, with a special sound from the collar being the trigger. This was added to the collar so that, if Mike heard a similar sound from another source, he would not transform unless he was wearing a collar.<br />
Mike didn&#39;t understand any of this though. He was happy to obey the pretty lights and voices. He was a good dog. He was a good boy. His fur was so comfortable. The full diaper felt so good. He had filled his diaper 5 times and it felt so good. A full diaper was a sign of an obedient diaper dog. Obedient diaper dogs obey Trainer and Master. He was a good dog so he fills his diaper and obeys. A wave of pleasure rushed through his body, as his diaper grew a bit more. He had pushed out even more free will. He had pushed out even more wrong answers. It felt so good to obey.<br />
Two hours passed quickly enough, and soon Diana returned to get Mike. Taking of the visor, she used a small remote to test out the collar&#39;s triggers. The remote was the size of a large key fob, with 7 main buttons and a on/off switch. The commands were called Private, Public, Human, Dog, Trance, Original, Recondition, Repress. All but one of the commands were fairly simple, but the last one was a special request. Rachel wanted to cover all of her bases, so she paid extra for special commands to be programmed into Mike. Most subjects end up forgetting almost everything about their old life, and the False personality is really only mirroring vague half-forgotten memories too ingrained to be fully removed. However, Mike had his entire personality and all of his memories contained by the hypnotic suggestions. The suggestions basically had all of it put into a mental box. If the Original button was pressed three times within 10 seconds, with at least one second in between each press. Then that box would unlock and Mike would be free, sort of. He would still have to be given permission to move and/or speak when he was first released. While he wouldn&#39;t have any major side affects, he would realize everything that had happened to him. This wouldn&#39;t matter too much, since the conditioning would prevent him from sharing this information in the presence of anyone who didn&#39;t know. In addition, Mike would still be subject to all of his triggers. As a result, this setting would force Mike to experience living like a pet and knowing that he was once human. It was even designed, so that he can re-experience the conditioning process over a time period, that could be adjusted using Trance, by his Master, with the Re-Condition. Slowly having his mind mental return to being an obedient diaper dog, but with the added pain of trying to resist. In emergencies, the Repress button would lock the mental box instantly. As it stood, the only way Mike could ever become human again would be years of therapy and, even then, the physical changes would never go away. Trying out and verifying that the first 5 triggers work, Diana tries out Original and...</p>
