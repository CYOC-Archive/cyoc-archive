<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff took stock of the situation, testing what being clothing was like. He found he could feel the bed underneath him, and hear the noises outside just as if he still had skin and ears. He could also see around him, though not from any particular point on his 'body'. After a little focusing, he found he could taste the bland cotton of his bedsheet, too, and he almost shuddered to think of what he would be tasting when we was worn. Maybe being clothing was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Jeff found he tingled with excitement and anticipation when he thought about being worn. The default options for his change ensured that he would enjoy his intended purpose. He wondered how his 'target' was going to find him while he was up here.<br />
<br />
His query was soon answered as a strong breeze blew against him, and his surroundings shifted. Suddenly he was outside, lying on the damp grass, and he could see the garbage truck looming over him. He could hear voices behind him, though he couldn't really see who was talking, he recognized one voice as being that of his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Mr. Bricks, we had some old clothes here and we thought you might appreciate them. You never seem to wear anything but that ratty old jumpsuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn Mister, yew din't have to go and dew that fer sure. Ah wear this ol' thing fer 'cause ah dun like bathin' or gettin' dressed see. Ah just wear this ol' thing all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, er, well I'm sure you'd like these. They're pretty comfortable, I'm told. I'll see you around Jim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yew too Mister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff heard his father walking back indoors, and shuddered as he begin to smell the ripe scent of body odor and garbage from the man left behind. The man walked over to him, and Jeff get a good look at him.<br />
<br />
Jim Bricks was tall, surely over six foot. He had his head shaved down to a short buzz, and his rough face was covered in a short but scruffy beard. The man was a bear, clearly overweight but with muscle under it. His big beefy arms dangled to the sides of his wide, hard beer belly, and every inch of him was covered in scruffy body hair.<br />
<br />
As Jim scratched his crotch, though, Jeff realized the most noticeable thing about him; he stank. He clearly took his job as an excuse not to bathe, and the stink of his unwashed body was almost visible.<br />
<br />
However, when those rough hairy hands picked him up, light as a feather, Jeff felt the words &quot;Master!&quot; run quickly through his head. He tried to focus against the feeling of sudden belonging and happiness that were filling his brain. Jim was his owner, and as clothing that suddenly felt really important.<br />
<br />
Jim carried Jeff over to an alleyway, and began to strip down. Jeff watched with a pang of disgust as the man's hard hairy belly was revealed. The pelt of hair there looked almost like fur.<br />
Jeff tried to look away as the man kicked off his boots and socks, and dropped his pants, but he could not turn at all. Jim's feet were huge, and wide, and the tops had their own covering of short hairs. As Jim pulled down his yellowed boxers, Jeff was treated to a view of his huge dick. It was fat and long even as it was soft, and dangled over equally huge hairy balls.<br />
<br />
Jim scratched his balls and whistled as he touched the cloth of Jeff's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoo-ee, this shure is fancy feelin'. I dun think I'll ever take it off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed silently as his lower body was picked up, the denim opened as Jim slid his hairy legs into Jeff's. Jeff could feel Jim's body against his skin, and as the big man zipped up, he could even feel that fat sweaty cock pressed up against Jeff's crotch. Jeff tried to hold his breath, but he hadn't any to hold. He was forced to smell the rank musky odor of Jim's sweaty crotch, and taste the salty flesh of the heavy dick.<br />
<br />
He hardly had time to recover before he felt those big, sweaty, smelly feet sliding into his warm boots, tasting the muscled feet and hairy toes as if they were in his mouth.<br />
<br />
He felt his hands picked up, and slowly slid onto powerful rough palms. It was like having his hands held by Jim, and he felt a slight feeling of happiness to be close to the big man. This feeling swelled even wider as he felt his cotton upper body sliding over the big man's chest, and suddenly he was being hugged by the hairy bear. He felt warm, and safe.<br />
<br />
As his face was wrapped around Jim's neck, Jeff's mind was ablaze with confusion. Being worn felt wonderful, but Jim was a disgusting pig.<br />
<br />
As Jim walked back to the truck, scratching his crotch and adjusting his balls, Jeff felt sweat soaking into his body, Jim's stink becoming a part of him, and was terrified to find he was enjoying it.</p>
