<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Six months had passed since David and Brad were returned to their rightful bodies. The whole incident strained the relationship between the two brothers and destroyed the relationship between Lance and New David, who was now just Brad. The incident also split David and Brad&#39;s family. While their sister Mariah and brother Lucas were supportive about David&#39;s actions, their parents felt that it was selfish of David to have forcibly taken back his body and life from Brad. Lance on the other hand was starting to sort out his feelings.<br />
<br />
Lance had given much thought about the matter and decided what he was going to do. He still had an attachment to David&#39;s body and he and David had started communicating a month after the operation. There seemed to be some sort of mutual attraction. Whether or not that had anything to do with the the body swap was not known. Even though there was deception involved in the procedure, Lance couldn&#39;t really blame or condemn David for his actions. <br />
<br />
Following the incident, David&#39;s mind and body were together again. Although this nightmare was finally over, David was still bitter about the events that had taken place these nine years. He would have to let go of his anger over time or it could swallow him up. Today was the day that he and Lance would go talk with his parents about all of this. In the time since the procedure, David couldn&#39;t help but notice his attraction to Lance and realized that the feelings were mutual. He had even started living with Lance in their shared home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey David, today&#39;s the day we go see your parents and have a word with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean have them lecture me and get on my nerves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t say that. You never know. Maybe these six months have softened their hearts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep dreaming.&quot; David said as he rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
The handsome older man looked at David in the eyes for a moment before tickling him and landing a peck on his lips. In the months following the swap, David couldn&#39;t help but be attracted to this middle aged man. He had been both a lover and a father figure even throughout these tumultuous times. While Lance had succeeded in being a mentor towards him, David&#39;s own father had failed to be a decent parent. His father had made terrible financial decisions and arbitrarily decided on having two of his family members swap bodies for money and when David had taken back his body, his Dad was everything but supportive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop. That&#39;s enough. Hah hah!&quot; David laughed as Lance was tickling him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright sport, but remember, I&#39;m just showing my love for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s embarrassing when you say it like that&quot; David blushed.<br />
<br />
Once the two were ready, they got into the car and high tailed it to their destination.<br />
<br />
At his childhood home, David was greeted by his parents, who introduced themselves to Lance as Steve and Cathy. They tried making some small talk, but it ended in vain. It was clear from their expressions that they were intent on getting to the main topic, so they brought David and Lance with them into the living room where Brad was waiting.<br />
 <br />
“Now you probably have an idea about what this will be about, so let’s keep it brief. We want you to swap bodies again with Brad and give him his adult life back” Steve abruptly announced.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” David couldn’t believe what he was hearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s only fair. I’m the one that had to go through high school, learn everything, go to college and get a job. That huge body was because of my hard work! I also want my life with Lance back!” Brad chimed in.<br />
<br />
Once David regained his composure, he voiced his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“First off, it was my body from the very beginning and my life! The only reason why any of this happened is because of you, Dad! You’re the one that had made poor financial decisions and you decided to sacrifice two of your family members just to get out of the mess that you created! If you were so desperate for money, you should have swapped your own body with some stranger or better yet, since you want Brad to have an adult life again, why don’t you swap bodies with him!? Also, not once did you, Mom or Brad think about how I felt or how humiliating and traumatizing these nine years have been!” David furiously spoke.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you talk to me like that!” Steve shouted.<br />
<br />
“I can see that this is getting nowhere. I can’t talk sense into any of you guys. This conversation is over. Lance we’re leaving.”<br />
<br />
“Come back here! We’re not done speaking!” <br />
<br />
Steve, whose face had turned red with anger, stared a hole into David face but David did not care. He pulled Lance towards him and the two of them hopped into the car and left his dad and Brad fuming.<br />
<br />
On the way back, Lance tried striking up some conversation to improve the mood.<br />
<br />
“Well that could have gone better. Who knew they were so closed minded? Maybe some fresh baked cookies would get them to come around?” <br />
<br />
“You’re telling me. I knew that this would happen. They’ve repeatedly refused to listen to reason and are always stuck in their ways. Not even a zombie apocalypse or some cookies would change their minds. You&#39;d have an easier time getting water from a stone.”<br />
<br />
Lance and David continued chatting until they returned home and from there, they both instantly jumped onto their sofa with David using Lance&#39;s lap as a pillow.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad that’s over with. I don’t want to speak to them again.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we will see how things go.”<br />
<br />
They sat in silence for a bit before David gathered his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been thinking. With this whole body swapping shenanigan, we haven’t really explored it in depth. You wanted to become younger right? What if we got you a new body, or we could swap bodies with one another. I wouldn’t mind taking a spin in your body. You&#39;re in shape, good looking and manly. Maybe we could even swap heads while we’re at it. I&#39;m just happy that I don&#39;t have to be kid again. What do you think?”  <br />
<br />
“Now that you mention it…”</p>
