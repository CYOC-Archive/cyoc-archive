<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You know this may not be the best idea, after all, walking around with a black latex collar around your neck with that bell ringing at every step would draw unwanted attention. But... maybe that attention wouldn&#39;t be so bad? Maybe this &#39;Vihllissa&#39; would find you, and treat you like the property you would be if you had the collar around your neck.<br />
<br />
Against what you knew was your better judgement, your hands grip either end of the collar, and bring it up to your neck. Almost on their own, your fingers work the buckle, pulling it snugly around your neck. The collar shifts the moment you let go of it. A moment of panic wrenches your mind, and your hands dart back to the collar&#39;s back, only to find the buckle was missing.<br />
<br />
Then... calm. <br />
<br />
Your hands lower back to your sides, resting on the sheets of your bed. You move your head around, getting used to the collar around your neck. However, in the middle of this, the collar&#39;s tightness seems to have... vanished. Again, your hands reach up to it, only to find that the collar is still very much there. Much to your shock, you find that you feel your fingers on the collar, as if it wasn&#39;t there to begin with. <br />
<br />
Chilly, inky black latex then begins to run up your neck, stopping at your jawline. The same goes down your neck as well, covering your chest and shoulders. Your eyes dart to the mirror as you throw your sheets off, and walk over to it. <br />
<br />
Pressure on your shoulders is followed by a visible slimming down of your shoulders. A pair of metal rings, not unlike the one on your... collar? neck? Whichever it is at this point, a pair of metal rings form on your shoulders, sitting just above your collar bone. The latex continues to creep down your arms, slimming them to more feminine proportions. As it crawls over your wrists, you see a pair of bands form around them, with metal rings hanging from them on either side. <br />
<br />
Your hands are next. You watch rather helplessly as your fingers- including your thumbs- are melded together into a single mitt. You&#39;re still able to move it and curl your &#39;fingers&#39;, but... the lack of thumbs will make things a bit hard. <br />
<br />
Down your chest, the latex continues its crawl, pausing at your breast. A pair of mounds begin to rise in place of your small pecs. They bulge out, staying firm and round, yet still looking entirely realistic. Your new D-cup breasts finish off with a pair of nipples poking out of their centers. <br />
<br />
Words can&#39;t describe how strange you find this. Despite your body changing before your very eyes, you feel... almost happy. You don&#39;t know who &#39;Vihllissa&#39; is still, but you find yourself really wanting to know her more and more. Maybe she&#39;s the one changing your body? <br />
<br />
That thought only makes you want these changes to happen faster. <br />
<br />
The latex continued moving down your body. It went over your waist, forming what looked like a corset from what you saw in the mirror. As it formed, your waist cinched down to about 24 inches around, and you felt every bit of that tightness. It remained, but felt more natural, mellowing out as the latex continued down. The chilly, black latex overtook your boxers, running down your thighs, and between your legs. <br />
<br />
An intense heat split up your body again as your dick started to recede into the latex. The bulge between your legs started to deflate, being replaced by smooth, black latex. A zipper then started to run from the front of your crotch, all the way to your ass, which had started to plump up and fill out. Underneath the zipper, you felt a new vagina expand inside your body. It started to moisten up with need, a need that you felt yourself as your changes continued.<br />
<br />
Your thighs became a bit rounder, filling out to stay proportional with your ass. A ring pair of metal rings hung down from your hips and thighs, just like your shoulders and wrists. The latex continued down your legs, toning your calves as it crawled to your ankles. A ring then formed on the back of each ankle. You were beginning to wonder what they were for...<br />
<br />
Upon reaching your feet, you felt yourself forced to your toes, which then started to point down as they merged together to a rounded point. A heel spike reached down to the floor before your feet solidified in this position, leaving you with ballet heels in place of your regular feet. <br />
<br />
Your eyes went back to the mirror. From the neck down, you were a woman in a black latex catsuit designed to be bound up, and left at the mercy of a Master or Mistress. Above the neck, you looked absolutely disgusting. that human-looking face and hair would not do for Mistress Vihllissa. You were her property- a toy, pet, plaything, whatever she wanted to call you, that&#39;s what you were.<br />
<br />
As if listening to your prayers, the latex crawled up your face and the back of your head. It crept into your lips, coating your mouth and throat with latex. A zipper formed of your mouth, one you couldn&#39;t unzip yourself. You couldn&#39;t make any sound while zipped up, not that you felt like unzipping it, or making any sounds. Your nose was overtaken by the latex, and as it plugged and sealed your nose up, rather than asphyxiate from not being able to breathe, you felt the exact opposite. You didn&#39;t need to breath anymore. <br />
<br />
Your hair was covered by the latex as it went over, making you bald. Your eyes were the last thing to be consumed by the latex, becoming made of latex themselves, fixing forward. Your once green eyes turned a bright, vivid pink, with your pupils becoming dark spots in the middle of your irises. <br />
<br />
While your external changes had finished, the latex was still working your insides. Many of your once-important organs, such as your liver, kidneys, pancreas, etc, all disappeared. Your lungs and stomach merged to a single cavity, while your anus <br />
<br />
You then feel an amazing and warm sensation on your neck. White letters etch themselves onto your latex skin, reading &quot;Property of Mistress Vihllissa&quot; in a very curvy font. <br />
<br />
You look back to the mirror at yourself, wondering what to do now. You can&#39;t really unzip yourself without thumbs or anything along those lines. Though... the more you look yourself over, the more you start to see yourself as a toy, a plaything, something left at the mercy of a Master or Mistress. <br />
<br />
You feel compelled to wait for your Master/Mistress. The only thing you can think to do is wait on your bed for them to arrive.</p>
