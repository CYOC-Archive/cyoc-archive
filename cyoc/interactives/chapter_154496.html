<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was sitting there with my hands raped around my now skinny chest feeling the bony ribs in the much younger body I am now in, this whole thing was my sisters idea, you see she had separated from her husband and had joint custody for her daughter (Sera), but she did not trust her ex-husband in being a good role model or even hurting her, So she came to me and asked me for her help to catch her ex-husband doing something irresponsible so she could tack full custody of Sera, I did not really want to help her because her ex was not such a bad of a guy but she was my sister after all and I would do anything to make her happy again what she has not been since her divorce so I let her in and tried to talk her about how I would be a terrible spy being 7-foot-tall and being fat with no hear on my head, he would spot me miles away.  <br />
<br />
She looked at me and smiled, I knew that smile it’s a smile she gives when she wont’s something big from me, I just said “what” and she looked at me and said “well there is a way you could spy on him while standing right in front of him and he would be none the wiser” I just waited for her to explain more and she did “ I found a way to swap people’s body&#39;s and persona’s”, I just looked at her like she has lost her mind but amused her by asking “what do you mean swapping persona’s “ she sat on a seat  and explained “ swapping persona’s would make you have the character of the person you swap with” I just sat there and said “ so I will act just like the person I swap with” she nodded and asked will I do it. <br />
<br />
I thought for a moment and thought it could not hurt her to let her try, I asked who I would swap with she looked at me a little uncomfortable and said well there this boy called Jimmy who lives in the flat next door to my ex and he is Sera’s best friend, every time I go to pick her up they are always together in the middle of doing something” I just looked at her thinking she wants to turn me in to a 10-year-old boy and I said “well at least I would be the perfect spy” and laughed a bit. <br />
<br />
 when she was ready she grabbed my arm and started chanting something what sounded like throat singing and everything went suddenly black, after 10 seconds I could see a small fin boy with blond hair walking straight at me and realised I was walking at him and could not stop myself or even open my mouth, when we hit each other a bright light shot into my eyes and there was a tv in front of me with cartoons on it, I looked down and saw a small body wearing pyjamas, I raised my hands in front of my eyes and saw how small and smooth they are, I felt how smooth my face was and had no 5 o&#39;clock shadow just smooth checks, I jumped up in shocked that it really worked and whispered “I am a kid again” what came out in a cute and high pitch voce what kind of liked. <br />
<br />
Them the door  swung open and a woman marched in and said “Jimmy you still in you PJ’s, I told you to have a bath 5 minutes ago” with a look of annoyance in her face, I just looked up at her and word’s started to fallout out of my mouth“ ow mum do I really have to, I had one 2 days ago” I was shocked at what I just said and how natural it felt but then I remembered about how we swapped Persona’s what would make me act like this 10 year old kid, when I was thinking “my mum” was going on about how I will be going over to Sera’s dads flat in 30 minutes what I just smiled and felt an energy of excitement coming from inside me. The woman aka Jimmy’s mum went over my the set of drawers and pulled out a per of white brief’s, a blue shirt and black jeans and through them at me and shouted “get your rump in that tub NOW” what made me quickly pick up all the clothes and ran out the door straight in the bathroom what I new where it was somehow. <br />
<br />
When I got in there I did not feel like I needed a bath but put the water on and let the tub to start it fill when I turned around and saw a fall length mirror and a quite handsome boy staring back at me, he looked like one of them kid model’s in a cloning magazine I seen, I looked down and pulled my pyjama top off what showed a skinny tummy what had the beginnings of an small 4 pack and felt my rib cage what you could see every signal bone and got an urge to explore more of this body what felt natural and there was nothing off or that different about my body what made me feel a little confused, I think there is more in this swap spell than my sister told me I said out loud looking in the mirror at the boy what felt normal to see staring back at me. After my bath I put on the cloths and headed to the front door and shouted “mum heading next door to play with Sera” she replied shouting from her room” ok sweetie I am going out in 5 minutes and should be back by 4 o&#39;clock ok, I just shouted “ok mum” and slammed the door behind me. <br />
<br />
When I got to Sera’s door and knocked nobody answered so I nocked again and again nobody answered me so I let myself in and saw Sera crying what I run up to her and put my arms around her thinking my sister was right he must me hurting her when I asked her what was wrong she looked at me with sorrow in her eyes and said “my uncle is dead” with tears running down her face what made me freeze of shock of being told that I am dead and i asked “what do you mean your uncle is dead” she looked at me with tears in her eyes and explained that he got mad when he was with her mum and ran out of her house in to a car what hit him, I just looked shocked and felt sick and felt tears rolling down my checks what I wiped away and tried to look like I was just trying to comfort my best friend. <br />
<br />
Then her dad came in and saw me hugging his daughter a smile came across his face seeing how her friend is so nice and said “hay Jimmy I guess Sera has told you” when she heard her father&#39;s voce she looked up and ran straight at him for his comfort, he picked her up in to a hug and said “ thanks for coming over but I think you should go home Jimmy, you can come and see Sera tomorrow” Sera looked up and said bye and I just said “sorry Sera” not knowing what else to say and left as fast as I could. <br />
<br />
When I got back to my flat I went to the phone and called my sisters phone, when she answered she sounded up set and all I said “it’s me” she just let out a cry and said “there is something I have not told you, I said ”what“ hopping it was something like time travel or something like that but it was much worse she started “well with the spell I did to you, I can only swap you back to your original body so you are stuck as Jimmy” I was shocked and stayed quiet but she continued “there is one more thing if you stay in the body of a Jimmy for more than 3 hours you will start to get his memory&#39;s and start it feel more comfortable living jimmy’s life” I just hung up the phone not wanting to hear any more of this and went to Jimmy’s room now my room and sat on my bad, and here we are me sitting on my bed with my hands raped around my chest thinking about my old body and how I got a photo shoot tomorrow for a magazine and how I was going to cheer up my friend Sera, not realizing Jimmy memory taking over my thoughts.</p>
