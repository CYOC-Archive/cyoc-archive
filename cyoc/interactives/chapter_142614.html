<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny&#39;s attention focused on the fairly active fantasies of one younger co-worker, it seemed like he was a game master for a fantasy game, who himself was fantasizing about his last session with his group.<br />
<br />
Apparently he had run a basic &#39;slay the dragon&#39; quest, and like some typical in-joke around roleplay gamers, they instead went and seduced the dragon, which the game master quickly revealed to be a girl just to roll with it; and it devolved into a dating sim. The way he imagined the dragon in his head afterwards was with a pair of breasts jutting out even though she was quadrupedal, and a short mane of hair like a young and slightly boyish girl.<br />
<br />
She wondered, she could get the guy&#39;s whole group involved, and started writing something to reveal the rest of the group&#39;s fantasies.<br />
<br />
Sorting through the next deluge of fantasies, some extra perspective entered her head that made her giggle. While the game master&#39;s fantasy didn&#39;t reveal completely clear details of the other players in that session, it turned out the other guys playing that session also roleplayed as girls, and found the little lesbian romance a cute little divergence from a story that might have otherwise been too serious. In fact, maybe that was why they all chose to play girls, it just seemed funny to them at the time.<br />
<br />
With a little smile, she started writing that the game master and his group will become their characters from that encounter, and that their personalities will become a fusion of their usual self and that of their character.<br />
<br />
As if a little bit of an afterthought, realizing this might cause a panic, she added an extra couple of phrases that while everyone will acknowledge the change, everyone outside the group won&#39;t consider it abnormal, and that the group itself won&#39;t panic over the changes that happen to them.<br />
<br />
With a final bit to specify that the changes will start in a minute, Jenny returned to work. Figuring she&#39;ll check back and see if they had fun tomorrow.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Henry, the game master, was not completely focused on his work, partly because it was actually quite simple compared to what he does on a regular basis as a game master. He fought back a yawn, but then as a few oddly coloured sparks and a tiny bit of glowing smoke came out, he flinched.<br />
<br />
With a couple of blinks, he suddenly realized he was laying down rather than sitting on his chair, and his body felt... Off. Looking down, a modest pair of breasts greeted him or rather her; pressing against the floor, while the unbuttoned collar of her seemingly unchanged shit leaving a window to their pink scaled cleavage.<br />
<br />
She suddenly caught the sight of her immediate superior walking over to her, and she stood up to greet him, noting how natural it felt for her to be on all fours while her tail extended out. She was about the same eye level as him like this; looking over herself, her body seemed to stretch across from her own cubicle to an empty one behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It good you only changed just before the afternoon coffee break, you think you&#39;re going to be good to finish today&#39;s work?&quot; her superior said.<br />
<br />
Henry raised an eyebrow, she expected him to make a big deal over this or something, like something impossible had happened, but then again... It was also weird that he wasn&#39;t panicking over this either. With a sigh, she looked at her foreclaws, and wiggled the digits. She was missing a thumb, it having shrunk to a mere dew claw, but the rest were still able to be used as fingers, albeit a bit shorter than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably, might take a few minutes to get used to this, but it should be fine,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; he said. He put a coffee mug with a straw in it on her desk. &quot;Here you go, should save you time getting it yourself, given your new size.&quot;<br />
<br />
She suddenly found herself blushing as he walked out, and she looked down at the scales on the back of her claw again. Purple... Or was it Lavender? Either way, it did remind her of the last game session she had run. With a small laugh, she got back to work, pausing for a moment only to glance at her phone laying on her desk as it vibrated, having just received a few text from her game group.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s how it is...&quot; she mumbled to herself, thinking it must have happened to them too.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jake found himself, now herself, standing in a bright pink maid outfit that her boss dressed her in as soon as she realized she&#39;d been transformed into a Kobold. She was still working the coffee taps, but now she had to stand on a box, having lost almost half her height.<br />
<br />
She felt so embarrassed, but so aroused like this. The way the stockings rubbed her legs, her wide egg bearing hips, the way the scales between her legs rubbed together as she fought the warmth in her loins, the way her traitorous tail kept flashing everyone her panties as it wriggled with her arousal.<br />
<br />
While only she had A-cup for breasts rather than anything else, on her short size they may as well have been B-cups; but either way, all it did was add to the &#39;cute&#39; aesthetic she had going.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t had a chance to see if she had the deep blue underbelly scales her character had, but she did possess her ruby red &#39;over-scales&#39;. Which made her think, she was the sorceress of her game group, maybe she could cast magic... Something she didn&#39;t want to bring up with her boss, she didn&#39;t want to waste her limited spells on something like a &#39;love charm&#39; just to make this place even cuter. She was the party&#39;s &quot;shoot it with lightning&quot; specialist, not its utility mage.<br />
<br />
Still, she could feel her character&#39;s side of her feeling very pleased at being able to have such a social job, making a joyful face and brightening their day, flirt with the boys and girls that pass through.<br />
<br />
She should have felt embarrassed that making her character bi had made her bi... But she couldn&#39;t really bring herself to want to get rid of that attraction. After all, she could relate to guys, and a lot of girls were so demanding even if they were absolutely adorable.<br />
<br />
… She shook the thoughts from her head, not a good look to be day dreaming on the job.<br />
<br />
How had her boss found a pair of frilly pink panties with a hole for her tail though? She assumed her own boxer briefs turning into boyshorts that still fit her was just part of the transformation, but that didn&#39;t explain her boss being prepared.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
When Robby changed, he was trying to play the guitar for a game soundtrack he&#39;d been hired to make for an Indy game.<br />
<br />
Turning into a Snow Leopard person in mid recording didn&#39;t really cause any issues, her character had a high dexterity after all, but they had asked if she was any good at singing for another track they needed. She wasn&#39;t sure she could, but after a quick little song &#39;audition&#39;, she found herself given the job; apparently she was quite good.<br />
<br />
… Realizing she could sing decently was the part where she realized she&#39;d turned into her character. She might not have been the party bard, but she had put skill points into singing. Really, her character was a rogue, of one of the spellcaster archetypes.<br />
<br />
One of her band mates smirked at her new appearance. &quot;Maybe you should wear a leather bra next time we get a gig, show off your new assets.&quot;<br />
<br />
She expected herself to growl, but instead she smiled and bounced her generous breasts a bit. &quot;That actually sounds pretty cool, kind of suits my aesthetic actually,&quot; she said. She wondered why she was so willing to bare her body like that, but then she remembered her character dressed like that normally anyways. Wearing leather panties on stage like her character might be a bit too far though.<br />
<br />
It wouldn&#39;t be too bad though, she had a lot of chest floof, it covered up most of her cleavage anyways.<br />

<br />
Marcus was having a weird day working at the public library. When he suddenly turned into a she, it came with loosing both his hands in favour of bat-like wings, and now she had to use her clawed feet for everything, which made it so whoever she was with always either got a good glimpse of her camel toe, or her ass.<br />
<br />
Still, it was kinda cool. She had been asking a lot when she made her character, being able to play a variant harpy rather than a normal one, even though harpies aren&#39;t even intended to be player characters.<br />
<br />
She fluttered down from putting away a book on one of the higher shelves, and decided now was a good time to take a break.<br />
<br />
She looked at a few books at chemistry that had piled up on the table. Somewhat a coincidence, given her character was an alchemist, and the party healer.<br />
<br />
… Maybe she should give them a read.<br />
<br />
She stopped that thought quickly when she saw an early teenaged looking girl walk into the library, only to notice her pointed ears and recognize her as the party &#39;utility wizard&#39;.<br />
<br />
Marcus giggled. &quot;College going fine?&quot; she asked. She noticed the rather annoyed expression on her face, pouting. &quot;Whatever is going on, just remember you&#39;re probably the most normal of us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elven girl groaned. &quot;The colleges in this country are hell! Its like the people going there never grew out of high school!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus shushed her, bringing a claw on her feet to her lips. &quot;No yelling in the library... I know somewhere a bit more soundproof you can vent though... But I&#39;m guessing they made fun of how young you look now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elven girl pouted. &quot;... Yes.&quot;<br />
---<br />
<br />
Terry had turned into a Centaur girl, and it was to her great relief that her car&#39;s seat had been changed to accommodate her new body, extending into the back seat, though there was still a back rest for her upper torso to sit back against. Her job was basically a glorified taxi, and not being able to drive would be... Inconvenient.<br />
<br />
Her current passenger tried to start up some idle conversation. &quot;Is it rude if I ask about your body?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;Not sure, but considering you&#39;re the first to even make a note of it, then sure, go ahead,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a set of... You know... For both the human half and the horse half?&quot; he said, pointing at the two pairs of shorts that she found herself wearing, one for each pair of legs.<br />
<br />
She rubbed her legs together as she was suddenly reminded of the heat going through her body. &quot;Yeah, one for each pair of legs... The front one is kind of a mix of both human and horse though... Was kinda hoping you&#39;d ask why I&#39;m a centaur in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy shrugged. &quot;I kinda thought people changing is just something that happens sometimes, not really something to put much thought into.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry laughed. &quot;Maybe, I don&#39;t know what happened anyways, so I suppose that&#39;s as good a way to put it as any,&quot; she said, &quot;that said, I do know I look a lot like a character I play in a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what kind of game? What she like?&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s... Kinda like cross between a Knight and a Wizard, usually she&#39;s wearing a full set of plate armour,&quot; she said, &quot;as for the game, roleplaying game... If you don&#39;t know what that is, then just imagine if acting was a game,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
The guy just nodded, and the conversation soon turned to something else.<br />
<br />

<br />
Jenny was finishing up for the night, she texted Dave to meet her at his place. Her new knowledge of all her co-workers fantasies gave her a few ideas on what Dave himself would like to try with this.</p>
