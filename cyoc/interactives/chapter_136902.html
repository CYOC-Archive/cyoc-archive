TransFun: Forming Felines<br />

<br />
Suzie grinned eagerly as her sister finished her wine, the last part of their dinner.<br />
<br />
“Okay, what gives?” Linda asked, leaning forward to look at her sister.<br />
<br />
“I have no idea what you mean, ” Suzie said, still grinning. “I’m just happy it’s your birthday, Sis.”<br />
<br />
Linda rolled her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Mm-hm. I know you a lot better than that. What’s the deal?” <br />
<br />
She scratched at her collar absently. Suzie’s grin grew wider. <br />
<br />
“You know how I work for TransFun, right? And how you like cats?”<br />
<br />
Linda connected the dots immediately, her eyes widening. <br />
<br />
“Is—is that what’s going on? My whole body feels funny, kind of itchy.” <br />
<br />
She scratched her belly, lifting her shirt to uncover the start of an amber coat of fur. <br />
<br />
“Suzie, you really shouldn’t change people without warning them first! When do these changes let up? What’s going to happen to me?”<br />
<br />
Suzie waved away her concerns dismissively. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it!” <br />
<br />

<br />
Suzie grinned, revealing slightly pointed canines. <br />
<br />
“I’ve taken a dose, too. We’re going to keep each other company for the rest of our break! In a few days we’ll wake up and everything will be fine!”<br />
<br />
Linda’s eyes widened, and she opened her mouth to poke at her teeth. Sure enough, they were just as long as Suzie’s were. She just hadn’t noticed because of their dinner, a nice course of seafood. She blinked, looking up at Suzie with a smile. <br />
<br />
“So is that why you were so insistent on cooking fish tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Suzie said with a smile, shivering as she felt the fur on her back come in. “Oh, this is new.” <br />
<br />
She rubbed her back against her chair, sighing contentedly. <br />
<br />
“You should really try doing this when you get some fur on your back. It’s itchy at first, but you get used to it really quickly. Then it’s like wearing a fluffy undershirt.”<br />
<br />
Linda continued to scratch at herself. <br />
<br />
“I’m really impressed this isn’t bothering you, Suz’! It’s like being bitten by a bunch of tiny ants!” <br />
<br />
Her fur now covered most of her arms and legs, and was working its way towards her face. <br />
<br />
Suzie smiled, scratching herself behind her ears aimlessly. <br />
<br />
“Well, to be honest, I’ve done some product testing before. It gets to the point where you start looking forward to the little changes like these.” <br />
<br />
She shook her head, much of her human hair fluttering to the ground to reveal a thin carpet of fur that steadily advanced across her face.<br />
<br />
“Is that supposed to happen?” Linda asked as she pointed to her sister’s head, scratching gently at her own to dislodge some of her own hair.<br />
<br />
“Yep! We can donate to Locks for Love, too! Grandma always supported that charity, you know.” <br />
<br />
Suzie smiled as fur swept across her face, the familiar itching no more than a comforting tingle by now. She was really amused by how preoccupied Linda was with scratching herself. <br />
<br />
She really should just go with the flow and things would be easier on her, thought Suzie.<br />
<br />
Suzie looked down to stare at her arm, watching her last spots of skin be overtaken by a smooth grey. <br />
<br />
“Oh, this is so cool!” she said, running her hands lightly through the short hairs on her arm. “So, what do you want to do now?” <br />
<br />
She looked up to Linda to find her sister running her tongue along her arm happily. Linda paused, looking up at Suzie guiltily. <br />
<br />
“What? I just wanted to see what it felt like! Cats do it all the time!”<br />
<br />
“That’s because they have cat tongues, Sis,” Suzie sighed, smiling patiently.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Linda said, a sheepish grin on her face. “Speaking of, why don’t we have those yet?”<br />
<br />
Suzie smiled, leaning back into her chair. <br />
<br />
“That’s the best part! We’re beta testing .....&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Suzie smiled, leaning back into her chair. <br />
<br />
“That’s the best part! We’re beta testing their new ‘Spaced Changes’ series, where things go off slowly without the need for heating. We get to have a good vacation, and be paid enough to go shopping later!”<br />
<br />
“Clever,” Linda said, before she frowned with realization. “What now?”<br />
<br />
That was just the question Suzie had been waiting for. Phase one of their changes was complete, so now they had a good amount of free time to do whatever. Thinking ahead, she’d brought Boggle, her sister’s favorite game.<br />
<br />
She didn’t even need to say anything, placing the box on the table was enough. Linda’s eyes lit up with her carefully-concealed competitive streak, and she quickly got to clearing the table. <br />
<br />
“You sure you’re ready to lose again?” she called over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Bring it, I’ve been reading!” Suzie grinned.<br />
<br />

<br />
A few rounds in, and Suzie was regretting her earlier confidence. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, this is such a hassle...”<br />
<br />
“Hassle!” Linda smiled, snapping her fingers as she jotted down another word. “Thanks, dear, that’ll really—oh!” <br />
<br />
She dropped her pencil, jolting upright as her spine ached. She looked behind herself, finding a tail quietly clicking its way from her spine, lifting up her dress slightly.<br />
<br />
“Oh! That means it’s time for the next round of changes!” Suzie looked down to her feet, wiggling her toes as they started to shrink. Her soles tingled the most, fluffing out to gentle, silky paw pads. “You really need to look at your feet.” <br />
<br />
Suzie smiled, absently, watching her nails sink a little under her skin, rounding out to retractable claws. <br />
<br />
“Watch out, though. Getting claws is always a little disconcerting.<br />
<br />
“Claws? I’m too busy trying to figure out how to work this thing,” Linda muttered before she had time to fully process her sister’s statement. <br />
<br />
A second later, her eyes widened as she caught on to Suzie’s remark, and she hurriedly pulled her shoes from her feet. Her left shoe came off normally, but her right shoe fell off without needing further prompt.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think it’s started already!” Linda gasped, her sock tearing as she pulled it off. “I guess claws don’t really go with socks that much, do they?” <br />
<br />
She watched her toes plump out until they were all as large as her big toe. Then, her big toe started to sink back into her body.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Suzie, is this supposed to happen?”<br />
<br />

added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 11:27<br />
<br />
Linda looked up to find Suzie wiggling a four-toed foot at her sister, a teasing smile on the girl’s face. <br />
<br />
“Oh,” Linda said lamely, watching as her toes moved to form a neat symmetry.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I have a great idea!” Suzie quickly sat on the ground, stretching out her human foot. “Hurry, take off your sock and place your foot against mine! I can feel the changes starting!”<br />
<br />
Linda followed suit hurriedly, pausing for a second to wiggle her furry toes. Then, she placed her foot against her sister’s, smiling fondly as she realized their feet were still the same size. Suzie had always been proud that the women’s feet matched.<br />
<br />
Linda gasped as she felt her soles plump out to pads, just as she could feel her sister’s do the same against her feet. She wiggled her toes, watching her other big toe sink back in to her foot. Now that she was expecting it, it definitely wasn’t as bad.<br />
<br />
Plus, it was nice to see the changes happening to her sister as well. She wiggled her toes, entwining them with Suzie’s. Together, the two women watched as their four toes slid to match those on their other feet, a small fan of fur and claw. Linda could feel Suzie twitch her toes slightly as her nails drew to points, leaving her a set of cute claws.<br />
<br />
Linda purred with happiness as Suzie rubbed her sole against her sister’s, their soft velvety pads running against each other. Suzie laughed, leaning back to pull her foot away. She shot back forward an instant later, a yelp of pained surprise coming from her mouth as she accidentally sat on her growing tail. She looked back with surprise, then scowled at her sister. <br />
<br />
“It’s not funny!”<br />
<br />
Hurriedly, Suzie snatched up a pencil, jotting down a few words before the timer chimed. “There, I win! How’s that for funny!”<br />
<br />
Linda sat upright, her eyes wide. <br />
<br />
“That’s cheating!”<br />
<br />
“That’s my third win of the night!” Suzie beamed, leaving out the fact that it otherwise would have been her seventh loss.<br />
<br />

added by SketchySeraph on 09/21/2016 11:40<br />
<br />
After that loss, Linda had redoubled her efforts and Suzie was left finding herself with less and less chances to win their ‘casual’ games, going past an even dozen defeats. She was halfway through yet another painful loss, only to find that her fingers were no longer working properly.<br />
<br />
“Time out!” she cried, her thumbs sliding back into her palms. Her face fell as she realized they’d have a much harder time playing now.<br />
<br />
“Why? I don’t see a prrroblem, ” Linda purred as she held her pencil between her hands, hurriedly finishing a pair of six-letter words before the timer rang again! “Yes! Fourrrteen!” <br />
<br />
She settled back, her tail swishing from side to side as she looked to her sister.<br />
<br />
Suzie was too distracted with her growing muzzle to care, her nose turning to a shocking pink while her jaw pushed away from her face.<br />
<br />
“Aghn!” Suzie gagged, her tongue falling from her muzzle as it flattened, growing tiny barbs along it. “Oh, this is so strange.” <br />
<br />
She rolled her r’s as she gently ran her tongue along her arm. <br />
<br />
“It’s like I’m brrrushing myself!”<br />
<br />
Linda followed suit, passing her tongue along her arm a few times. After the first few licks, she felt a little bit of resistance from her fur, like she was combing her body with her tongue. <br />
<br />
“You’rre rrree-ight!” Linda smiled, then frowned as she spoke again. “Wait, am I losing my ability to speeeow! Reow!” <br />
<br />
Her throat tingled as her speech degenerated into a series of meows and yowls, and she pouted with her still-human lips.<br />
<br />
Suzie smiled at her sister, sticking out her tongue. <br />
<br />
“Grrreat last sentence, Sis. Rrreally brrrings out the intellectual in yyyyowrrr, ” Suzie said with a nod, content she was able to get a quick jibe in.<br />
<br />
Linda pouted, her frown seeming to get a little bit larger as the top of her lips joined with the bottom of her nose. Her muzzle grew out next, and she blinked rapidly as she contemplated having such a large mouth.<br />
<br />
She looked at her new muzzle, meowing as her eyes tingled. She watched as a lot of vivid colors seemed to disappear from the world. No doubt her eyes were making the shift to those of a feline. Linda turned her head from side to side, noticing how it seemed like she had much better peripheral vision.<br />
<br />
Suzie meowed, stretching her back out as it readjusted for four-footed travel. Her ears felt like someone was tugging on them, and she batted the side of her head as they slid to the top of her head. She looked at Linda, curious as to how the firs-timer would handle this. Sure enough, she was holding her paws against the side of her head, meowing as her ears popped up from under them.<br />
<br />
Suzie purred with amusement at the sight, a human-sized cat in a dress that was distressed over her new ears. Linda looked back, half-forming a hiss in response, before she too started meowing with laughter. Evidently she shared her sister’s sense of humor. Suddenly the pair of women could see the appeal in Keyboard Cat and videos like that. They played around the house for a few minutes, slinking their bodies up and down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Then Linda got a great idea.<br />
<br />

<br />
Her eyes wide, Linda meowed at her sister, pointing her paw forward. Suzie shook her head, uncomprehending. Linda rolled her eyes, then set off at a quick trot around the room. She then looked back to Suzie and darted into another room. Suzie grinned, bounding after her as they raced around their house.<br />
<br />
Suzie’s eyes widened partly through their third lap, and she quickly scurried upstairs. Earlier she’d set up an automatic cat feeder, but she had covered it with a blanket so Linda wouldn’t find out. In her joy at transforming, she’d completely forgot to uncover it. She tugged at it with her paws, then grabbed a bundle of fabric in her mouth and pulled. The cloth fluttered to the floor, and Suzie hurriedly tapped her paw against the dispenser.<br />
<br />
She meowed happily as the container spilled out a hearty dose of food for her. Just as she leaned down to eat, her right ear flicked back as she heard a cat yowling. <br />
<br />
That sounded like Linda! <br />
<br />
She darted downstairs, her head bobbing left and right.<br />
<br />
Her feline eyes alit on a wriggling bundle of clothes, and she purred with amusement as Linda poked her head out from her suddenly-oversized clothes. She wasn’t able to laugh for long, though, as a constricting feeling overcame her entire body.<br />
<br />
It was a paradoxical feeling, her body feeling too small around her even as her clothes suddenly felt much, much too large. She yowled with distress as her sleeves bundled up against her forepaws, her hind legs kicking wildly through the nylon blanket that was her athletic shorts.<br />
<br />
Suzie rolled around, kicking at the blankets of clothing around her as she struggled to free herself. Finally, she poked her head from the oversized collar of her shirt, hissing with dismay as she saw Linda had been waiting with patient amusement for her.<br />
<br />
She’d have to pay her back for that! Suzie lunged out from her clothes, play-tackling her sister. <br />
<br />
They continued to play well-on into the night.</p>
