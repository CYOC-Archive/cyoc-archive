<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s note: No sex yet, but there is a bit of foreplay.<br />
<br />
Melissa and Trevor climbed out of the truck.  Trevor got the igloo out from the back as well as a blanket for the two of them to sit on.  Melissa carried her bag containing her werecow birth control pills as well as the bag of soda that they picked up from the gas station.  The two walked from the truck to the picnic site, which was a good 15-minute walk away on top of a hill.  While Trevor, being a werebull that he is, had no trouble walking up the hill, Melissa was lagging a bit behind and was winded when she joined Trevor at the picnic site.  However, when she did join Trevor, she was amazed by what she saw.  At the top of the hill, she could see the entirety of Moon Lake.  Her eyes sparkled as she saw the waves dance in the reflecting light of the setting sun.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; was all she could say as she looked around at the natural beauty around her.<br />
<br />
Trevor smirked and said, &quot;Nice place, huh?&quot; as he set the igloo down and picked up the blanket.  &quot;This is a place I found a few years ago, soon after my first transformation.  As you can probably tell, it&#39;s secluded and quiet.  It&#39;s where I go when I need to think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa looked around and said, &quot;I can see why.  Nothing and no one around for miles.&quot;  The two laid down the blanket on a piece of ground under a tree and with a nice view of the lake.  Melissa pulled out the sandwiches and shared them with Trevor as he poured the drinks.  The two discussed a number of things, including things from school, home, and family.  Melissa learned that Trevor was the oldest of three siblings.  There was Anna Bell, who was 13 and was turning 14 in a few weeks.  And then there was Clint, the youngest, who was turning 10 soon.<br />
<br />
Melissa also asked about the group of school.  She was a bit curious as to why a wererabbit, a weretiger, a werefox, a werebull, and a werewolf were so close to each other.  As it turns out, the five of them were part of an academic team.  They would take part in a variety of all sorts of academic competitions from debates to tests to presentations and other things.  Ms. McCoy was also their advisor and helped the team out with a number of things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; remarked Melissa. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; replied Trevor.  &quot;You should join us sometime.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be a welcome addition.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that time, all the food was eaten, and an hour passed by as they talked.  &quot;While we&#39;re here,&quot; Trevor said, &quot;you should see how the setting sun looks on the lake.  There&#39;s nothing quite like it, especially from this view.&quot;  Trevor pointed to a nearby tree and then sat with his back against it.  Melissa smiled as he joined him.  She elected to sit between his legs, her back against his chest, and the same view as him.  Trevor was a little surprised at first, but then he responded by wrapping his arm around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Melissa said as she watched the reflection of the setting sun in the water, &quot;you&#39;re right, this is beautiful.&quot;  The two watched in silence for a few minutes before Melissa asked a question.  &quot;Trevor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; he responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like me?&quot;  She asked as she glanced behind her.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked at her and replied, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean...why do you like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor paused to think a little and said, &quot;I do like you, Mel.  Heck, when I first saw you, I liked you.  I&#39;ll admit a bit of an attraction, but when I saw you alone at class, I felt this need to protect you.  And seeing you learn about us and how accepting you were...well, I grew to like you even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled when she heard this and said, &quot;I like you too.&quot;   She paused for a moment and said, &quot;You know, if we&#39;re going to be together, I&#39;m going to...um...you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor smiled and nodded his head.  He then asked, &quot;You know what you want to be?&quot;  Privately, he hoped that she was wanting to join the werecattle, and he&#39;d be the one to initiate her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said looking off to the side, &quot;If I&#39;m going to be with you, I&#39;d like to be a werecow.&quot;  Trevor remembered his dream from last night, but didn&#39;t say anything.  She continued, &quot;My dad told me to bring my werecow birth control pills, in case, you know, something happens.&quot;  At that point, Trevor could feel his penis start to inflate from hearing that.  &quot;I do love you, Trevor.  At first, I just saw you as a rather hunky piece of meat, but since then, I&#39;ve grown to love you more.  The way that you protect me.  The way that you respect me.  The way you treat me.&quot;  Trevor could feel his heart pound as he looked down at Melissa smiling.  &quot;If I&#39;m going to be with you, Trevor, I&#39;d rather be a werecow.&quot;  She glanced at him as she smiled.  <br />
<br />
By now, his penis was fully erect in his pants, and he was a bit self-conscious about Melissa feeling it, considering that she was sitting against him between his legs.  But, were libido aside, he had to ask one thing.  &quot;Is this what you really want?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled and nodded as she answered, &quot;Well, I did think about becoming a werevixen, but I&#39;m sure this is what I want.&quot;  She paused for a moment and asked, &quot;If I did decide to become a werevixen instead of a werecow, would you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor smiled as he brushed her hair to the side and said, &quot;I love you for who you are, Mel.  No matter which way you went, what made you you wouldn&#39;t change, and I would still love you no matter what you looked like on the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa smiled wide as tears started to form in her eyes.  It was at that point she was aware of his trapped erect penis in his pants, and subconsciously rubbed against it.  He almost let out a moan from her rubbing his sensitive flesh.  At the same time, his hand also subconsciously moved from her shoulder to her breast and started to massage that softly.  Melissa noticed this but did nothing except enjoy the pleasurable feelings it was giving her.  She bit her own lip to keep from moaning herself.  By now, both teenagers were turned on, and if things progressed any further, they both knew where it would lead.  Mel, for the most part wanted this, but she wasn&#39;t completely sure yet. It was at that moment, she made a decision.<br />
<br />
She gently removed Trevor&#39;s hand, turned to him, and said, &quot;Trevor, I need you to...&quot;</p>
