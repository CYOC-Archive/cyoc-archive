<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not all events on Memorial Day related veterans sharing stories. In many ways it was the start of summer and was an invitation for cook outs and other related activities, and in the backyard at the Wesley house, Thomas Wesley had his grill going to barbecue plenty of good foods for a small party for family friends. It was something that he always did and was something he wasn&#39;t going to stop doing because of being an Animalian. He had some steaks, hot dogs, and sausages on the grill along with sweat corn and carrots wrapped in aluminum foil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t be too long to have everything ready,&quot; Tom announced to the others that were present.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Josephine Brown commented, &quot;it&#39;ll be interesting to see how barbecued corn and carrots taste now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t had this before?&quot; Sophie&#39;s mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as a horse, I haven&#39;t,&quot; Josephine gave a small chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame you can&#39;t have hot dogs any more,&quot; Sandy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you corn on the cob,&quot; Josephine retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d depend on your definition of hot dog,&quot; Julia commented from the plastic lawn chair she was seated in with Bell and Bash cradled in her arms, and gave a small smile, &quot;as I&#39;m sure Martin has a sausage that she likes very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine gave a startled snort and Sophie&#39;s and Jessica&#39;s mother&#39;s practically gasped in surprise. Sandra only gave a playful giggle as the group looked over to the grill where their husbands were presently looking over the grill and discussing sports, including the fight at the Giants/Nationals game. The ladies had collected together which had soon included comments on how cute Bell and Bash were, which gave Julia some pride. Though that didn&#39;t necessarily lessen the urge to make the joke that Julia made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Martin is a very handsome stallion,&quot; Josephine gave a weak smile, &quot;but I don&#39;t think THAT would be something done at a Memorial Day cook out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a good thing, too,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother spoke in a tone that made it clear that she didn&#39;t want to spend the day talking about sex. The others caught on and didn&#39;t mention anything more directly on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame the kids could be here,&quot; Sophie&#39;s mom commented, &quot;They&#39;re probably not getting anything this good out in Latin America...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well a lot of what they have is part of Animalia&#39;s attempts to work out things with other countries and maintain global support for Animalia,&quot; Julia commented, &quot;they&#39;re probably too busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, a shame they couldn&#39;t be here,&quot; Sophie&#39;s mom commented, &quot;I mean... this time last year, they were only interested in having some fun for the summer. Now... it&#39;s like they&#39;re adults doing things that they aren&#39;t old enough to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things change quickly,&quot; Sandra commented, &quot;all our kids were bound to grow up sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still happening too fast if you ask me,&quot; Sophie said with a frown as she looked to the Wolf Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things always happen fast,&quot; Josephine said with a small shrug, &quot;and while our kids are all growing up... it&#39;s not like they&#39;re not turning out well...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a series of nods as well. A lot of things had changed quickly, particularly in relation to the Animalia outbreak. While Sophie&#39;s and Jessica&#39;s parents didn&#39;t have much interest in becoming Animalians, they did recognize that it had represented a changing world, and they did have some pride in their children. Jessica&#39;s mom was proud that her daughter was willing to wait until she actually grew up to take a mate, while Sophie&#39;s mom was proud that Sophie hadn&#39;t abandoned her friends that had become Animalians. In that they could be proud that their daughters remained respectful and good people. Some things may be happening fast, but they were still growing into the sort of people that the collected parents wanted to raise.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t think we have anything to be really worried over,&quot; Julia commented, &quot;our children have done well. I&#39;d wish that Sarah and Malice could be here too, but they are doing things that will help Animalia and aren&#39;t without some help. We can be proud in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can also be proud in great food,&quot; came Thomas&#39;s voice as he approached and handed a plate of sausages to Sandra and a plate of grilled/smoked corn on the cob and carrots to Josephine. &quot;Just like always... even with things different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it does smell good,&quot; Josephine replied as she began snacking on the carrots that had been wrapped in aluminum foil before being put on the grill. It still had a sort of smokey flavor but didn&#39;t lose the sort of taste that would be associated with carrots. It actually didn&#39;t taste too bad.<br />
<br />
Thomas then looked over to Julia  who was now carefully moving to set her two sleeping puppies inside a mobile carrier that allowed them to move Bash and Bell around as needed. It even had special netting that could be laid over the top that would protect both of them from mosquitoes or any other biting pest that might threaten them, allowing them to be brought outside at times. There were also special sun shades for daytime activity that would prevent them from being blinded or hurt by UV light. Jessica&#39;s mom had noticed the happiness that both Thomas and Julia seemed to have with their new children and that actually raised some curiosity as she then looked to Josephine while Thomas went to get the rest of their food.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Josephine... you and Martin got the whole age reset with all this,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mom commented, &quot;and if they had a human variant of the Animalia Virus... I&#39;d jump for it for that reason... have you and Martin thought about... well, having a bigger family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine blinked, &quot;Well... not really. I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be nice, but I think it&#39;d be something to decide on when Abby is at least eighteen, if not graduated from college and onto the next stage of her life. Martin and I are quite happy together, but we do have Abby and the expansion of the farm to grow food to feed many Animalians does take a lot of work. If things go well... maybe we&#39;ll have a foal... if not... we would still be there for when Abby and Samson have children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he or she would be a very fine foal,&quot; Sophie&#39;s mom commented, &quot;I&#39;ll admit... some of the conversion stuff makes me a bit nervous, but I&#39;m a sucker for babies. Bell and Bash are so cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... perhaps we may get to that,&quot; Josephine chuckled, &quot;but that&#39;ll mean you&#39;ll get calls to baby sit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, here!&quot; Sophie responded with a laugh as their cook out party continued.</p>
