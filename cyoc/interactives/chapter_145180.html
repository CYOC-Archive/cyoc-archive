<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You feel fabric rise to cover your entire surface, then another tug as Brooke pulled the panties firmly into place. Soft and clean. It felt unbelievably comfortable, like the greatest bed that you had ever lain on. You felt that you could very easily fall asleep here, but that thought was quickly wiped away by your hunger. Cock. You needed it. You were made for this. To take a big, hard, warm cock deep into yourself. To grasp and squeeze at it until it pumped its delicious hot semen deep into you. A bead of drool escaped your lips. These panties would not remain clean for long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, asdhf sdjfk lasdj, my little pussy.&quot; More gibberish, but you could at least make out your name. Pussy, Brooke&#39;s good wet little pussy. That was you. Or... was it? Didn&#39;t you have another name than that? You were definitely Brooke&#39;s pussy, and you loved being Brooke&#39;s pussy, but weren&#39;t you... something more than that? You swam through your thoughts, searching for something that you knew should be obvious, but struggled to find it despite that, like suddenly forgetting the word for something despite having used that word a thousand times.<br />
<br />
But your thoughts were scattered and lost by a sudden wave of arousal. You knew that this time it came from Brooke herself. Time has passed rather quickly as you had wrestled with your thoughts and your desires, and she was already fully dressed, made up, and ready to find herself a one night stand. Though you couldn&#39;t see, somehow you knew she was admiring herself in the mirror, making sure that every detail was perfect. She wanted to make sure she was stunning enough to bag the hunkiest guy at the bar.<br />
<br />
Wait, how did you know that? Somehow, the arousal she was feeling linked your minds together, not like hearing her think, but somehow you just inexplicably... knew things that you didn&#39;t before. You knew that she was excited about this. You knew that her thoughts were almost as lustful as yours. You knew that the idea of sharing this experience with you, the most intimate experience she could imagine, was incredibly arousing. You also knew that... this was against her better judgement? That she would never dream of going through with this if she weren&#39;t so god damn horny? What did all that mean? <br />
<br />
&quot;Fqwiohv,&quot; Yet again your thoughts were interrupted, gone as if you had never had them in the first place. &quot;Awueah fei&#39;t gsef, pussy, gi&#39;sd pcs lhsf oawg msndf anw!&quot; <br />
<br />
More of her arousal leaked into you, and this time you were happy to return arousal of your own. You wanted cock. You wanted it so bad, and through her arousal you knew that it was coming. You would not have to wait long. Soon you would be filled, you would be whole, your purpose fulfilled. More drool soaked into your panties. What were they even doing here? It wasn&#39;t time for sleeping, it was time for cock!<br />
<br />
Voices, many different voices, from all around you. You had been lost in yourself again, and time had flown by. Owner was feeling very horny again. Her voice was one of the many. When she spoke, you could feel the light vibrations travel down through the rest of her body and into you. But they weren&#39;t enough to make you feel anything. Frustrated, they just made you think of the vibrator again. Mmm, yes, now those were the kind of vibrations you needed. Wait, wasn&#39;t Owner going to find you some cock? Where was the cock? You remember now, Owner was going to find a handsome, strong man to give you their cock! But... Owner? Yes, she was your Owner, you were a part of her after all, and you loved her and you loved being her little pussy. But... didn&#39;t she used to be more than that? Didn&#39;t you used to call her something else? What was... <br />
<br />
You felt something! Pushing the panties open a bit, it swept down through your hair, briefly brushing past your hood, your clit, your urethra, before dipping itself between your folds. Muscular. Dexterous. It wasn&#39;t a cock, but it filled you hunger just enough to send your thoughts wild. You wanted to cry out. Please, touch me more, you pleaded silently. Go deeper! Move around! Please! But as quickly as it arrived, the welcome invader retreats, taking with it a generous glaze of your drool. No! It&#39;s not fair! Come back! You need this so badly! You had just a taste of being filled, and now your mind is desperate with lust. Fingers, vibrators, dildos, cocks, they flash through your mind. You&#39;re drooling so much now, you want the fingers to come back, take more of it, take it all! You just need to be filled! Please!<br />
<br />
You snap out of it. Once again you sense that more time has passed than you perceived. You feel the panties being pulled away from you. You realize just how uncomfortable you had been, with the formerly heavenly panties drenched so heavily in your drool. Through the panties, much of your drool had been spread lightly on the outside of your lips, and now the the cool air touches you and you feel it all much more acutely. This wasn&#39;t right! That was meant as an offering to a cock, to make it easier for it to pump in and out of you. To feel it instead on your surface, where it would do a cock no good, made you upset.<br />
<br />
But why were you upset? Cock was near! You knew it because Owner knew it. From above, you heard moans, sounds of lips smacking, tongues full with saliva recklessly dancing with each other. Now you knew why you were upset! That tongue should be dancing with you, not with that disgusting food hole. You had made so much saliva of your own down here, far sweeter and more luxurious than that common spit. What had you done wrong? Why would Owner continue to torture you like this? Weren&#39;t you a good little pussy? Didn&#39;t Owner love you as you loved her?<br />
<br />
The making out stopped, and for the first time all day, you could understand completely as owner spoke: &quot;I need it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cock? Cock! You knew the cock was coming because owner knew cock was coming. Her arousal flowed into your, and your arousal flowed around it. Cock! Cock! Cock is here! Oh Owner, I knew you loved me! And I love you! And I especially love cock! Cock cock cock cock!<br />
<br />
With your mind completely lost to the thirst, you feel it. Warm, smooth, bulbous. The head of a cock meets with your lips. Time stands still as the man takes one last moment to make sure he&#39;s positioned properly. Then, it finally happens. The cock thrusts deep into you, your bountiful ocean of juices allowing you take it in eagerly. Your mind is shattered with pure joy. You forget what you are, even what a cock is. All you know is satisfaction. Bliss. Pride. Relief. For just a moment, every happy emotion surges through your very essence as you know, simply, that this is right.<br />
<br />
The world comes back to you. In and out and in and out, Owner moaning loudly above you, you still can&#39;t form a coherent thought, but you wouldn&#39;t want to anyway. Sexual pleasure fills every inch of your small body. You bask in the warmth of the cock, savor the taste of its smooth skin against your slick insides, pulse with its rhythm as it continues to pump in and out. But a new taste overwhelms your sense. Mixing with your own nectar, there is something delicious beyond description. Precum. Ah, but despite how unbelievably good it tastes, you know that it&#39;s only the appetizer.<br />
<br />
The pace quickens. You take in every bit of the experience that you can. You feel droplets of sweat sliding past your lips. You feel the man&#39;s pubes briefly meet with your own, loosely entangling, before pulling your skin ever so gently as he rears back for another thrust, only for it all to repeat again. Owner&#39;s moans travel to you both through her body and through the air. Distantly, you can hear her breathing become faster and faster as the pace slowly becomes even more intense.<br />
<br />
To say your senses are overwhelmed would be such an understatement. You try and try to keep up with it all, but the pleasure just keeps mounting. It&#39;s clearly a mental battle that you can&#39;t win, but for whatever reason you&#39;re compelled to try anyway. Everything is happening so fast now. Everything feels so good now. But just when you think it can&#39;t possibly feel any better, Owner&#39;s delicate hand reaches down and circles your hood. You barely have time to register what&#39;s about to happen before she begins carefully stimulating your clit with deftly and practiced expertise. All the work you had put into remaining lucid vanished in an instant, as an entirely new level of sexual pleasure melts your thought away once again. There is no longer perception, there is only raw, unfathomably powerful lust reaching into every crevice of your mind, body, and soul.<br />
<br />
And then your consciousness simply explodes. Again you find yourself in the void of happiness. This time not so briefly, you float aimlessly in a infinite sea of positive emotions. It is peace beyond words. No thoughts, no feelings, just peace. In this space, there is only one thing you know, and that is that this is how it was meant to be. You have achieved your purpose. You know, simply, that everything is right...<br />
<br />
...<br />
...<br />
...right?<br />
<br />
Sense of being returns to you, but very slowly. Like waking from an extremely deep sleep or possibly a coma, everything takes time to adjust again. A small amount of time has passed, and you become aware that the cock is no longer in you. But that&#39;s okay. Your hunger has been sated for now, the overwhelming need to be filled no longer clouding your every thought. And besides, the cock left you a gift. As your senses warm back up, you both feel it and taste it at the same time: semen. You feel a little sad knowing that you weren&#39;t aware enough to feel it flow into you when it was still fresh and burning hot, that probably felt so nice. You don&#39;t linger on it because god damn were you right, it tastes so good. You bask in the taste for a moment. It&#39;s so incredibly delicious. You would never be able to explain this taste. It&#39;s so much better than anything you had ever had as a human.<br />
<br />
Wait, human? That&#39;s right, you were human before. It feels so strange that you had forgotten that. Damn, you think. You had really gone crazy, hadn&#39;t you? While definitely concerning, it&#39;s hard for you to say that you regretted it. No, you couldn&#39;t regret this. That had been sex beyond anything you could have ever imagined. You would never forget it. And to share it with your beloved Brooke, too, made it all the more special.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Brooke. Breaking from your thoughts, you feel that she&#39;s moving around. Maybe going to the bathroom? No, on second thought, you feel fairly clean, definitely much cleaner than a pussy should be right after getting fucked. You reason that she must have peed and wiped you off while you were still out of it. Still not quite fully out of your mental daze, you finally remember that you&#39;re able to communicate with her magically... or telepathically? Whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brooke?&quot; You say. She jumps a little bit, clearly startled by hearing your voice in her head again. Maybe she, too, had forgotten in all this craziness that you could do this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe? Oh god, I was afraid I had lost you! Why the fuck didn&#39;t you respond earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I guess I was lost for a little while there. It&#39;s hard to explain, I&#39;m sure it felt great for you, but for me it, uh, well it pretty much literally blew my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her anger was suddenly replaced by relief. &quot;It&#39;s... okay. I was just so scared. I can&#39;t believe we really did this, you know? Today&#39;s been such a blur! God, honey, I cheated on you!&quot; The emotions that had been pushed down and held back all day suddenly ambushed her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brooke! Baby! Don&#39;t think of it like that! It&#39;s all... just really weird. I mean, I was here for it all, so it was more like a threesome, really? You haven&#39;t done anything wrong! I asked for it, after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
She started to calm down. &quot;Yeah... I guess... This has all just been too much for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know it was crazy and weird and nobody will ever believe us but I don&#39;t regret it for a second, because I got to share it all with the girl I love.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t see it, but you knew that cheesy line had gotten her to ease up and smile. &quot;Heh, I love you, too, you dork.&quot; She reaches down and strokes your pubic hair. You&#39;re surprised by how soothing it feels.<br />
<br />
&quot;That being said, I&#39;m ready for a nice long vacation to normaltown after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, right! God, I&#39;ve been so out of it that I forgot I even had this thing on still. Yeah, I&#39;m all for that. Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready as I&#39;ll ever be.&quot; And with that, she took the ring off her finger...</p>
