<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As a matter of fact, the gene serum that Ash had just dosed Ethan with was that of a Bengal Tiger - a big jungle cat that would mean by the time the change was done with Ethan, he&#39;d likely be on a fast track to a far away wildlife center. Though nobody exactly knew that now. As far as Ethan was concerned, he was on top of the world right now. Once the jocks were all animals, he&#39;d be free to have his pick of the bitches. Heh, he thought, just picturing it made his dick fucking pulse. Even though Ethan wasn&#39;t going to demonstrate any changes right away, he did validate Ash&#39;s decision as he said, &quot;Come on dude, don&#39;t be such a wet blanket. We&#39;re gonna be the kings of the school once the steroid monkeys are all in the zoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure dude, sure.&quot; Ash said, suppressing a smirk at the thought that once this was done, his sister wouldn&#39;t have to deal with Ethan&#39;s tendencies any more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s have some more enthusiasm, man!&quot; Ethan said as he continued playing his video game. He honestly didn&#39;t get why Ash was so reserved about this. The jocks got to be all about libido all the time. So what kept them from enjoying...? Ethan found himself getting a wee bit distracted as he tried to play his game. It sure seemed for all his talk that at least the jocks could have a handle on themselves. Whereas Ethan just merrily got too turned on to function.<br />
<br />
Ash saw the impression in Ethan&#39;s shorts and winced. Much as he wanted to think this was the start of some sort of change from the gene serum, he was just as well capable of remembering that Ethan was a horny bastard. And once he got to a certain point...well, social graces became second to dealing with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dude,&quot; Ethan said as he got up, &quot;Imma go shower up in your shower room. Feel free to...do whatever.&quot; And with that, Ethan started heading upstairs, grinning down at his crotch. It was radiantly obvious what he was actually going to do.<br />
<br />
Ash rolled his eyes and said, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll hold down the fort down here.&quot; Damn but it was hard to not gloat. But Ash was deadset on not carrying out Ethan&#39;s flaws. And one thing that guy always seemed keen on was gloating way too hard. Heh...hard.<br />
<br />
As Ethan reached the bathroom, a pretty well spaced out and nicely constructed two part area with a shower room built into the side, he promptly stripped down to his boxers and locked the door behind him. Thankfully, the doors and walls were nicely made enough to conceal what he was gonna do from Margie. He wasn&#39;t exactly ready to have her just overhear him going to town on himself yet.<br />
<br />
Sure he wasn&#39;t as built as the jocks, but he did workout a bit, and he had something nice to show for it. His lanky, svelte build came with a tight core, decent pectorals, tight if somewhat thin arms...and as far as Ethan was concerned, a good looking face. And as far as lower body...<br />
<br />
He had pretty good legs on him, and a strong bubble butt of an ass.<br />
<br />
He commenced his usual self pleasure habit, rubbing his entire body from chest to legs, shivering as he cupped his buttocks. &quot;Mm...I&#39;m a sensitive boy today...&quot; He purred at himself. He felt his cock leap to erection as he felt up his ass. That was one thing he really looked forward to having babes help him out with. Sucking his cock, and feeling up his butt at the same time.<br />
<br />
As far as Ethan was concerned, there was nothing queer at all about liking ass play. Sex was all about what felt good, not what exactly happened during it. One hand gripping his cheeks and teasing his hole, making Ethan grunt, he played with his cock - still concealed by his white boxer-briefs. &quot;Mm...mm...yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t yet remove his boxers. He wanted to build up.<br />
<br />
Ethan blushed as he palmed his cock through the boxer-briefs, letting out a harsh breath. He shook on his feet as he preened and pushed at his manhood. &quot;Ohh...oh...fuck me...&quot; He whispered to himself. He kept pushing on his tush with one hand, while relieving his manhood as he felt his taut, thin form with his other. His hand rubbed over skin enticed into goosebumps, tightly corded muscle quivering in response to his touch.<br />
<br />
He bit his lip as his hand reached his pecs, gliding over sensitive nipples that sent veritable lightning bolts of arousal right to his manhood. Ethan moaned under his breath, still keeping control. &quot;Ohh yes...so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now he was good and aroused as much as possible without directly touching his cock, Ethan gingerly removed his boxer-briefs. He let out another harsh breath as he felt the warm air on his manhood - which as of now was wet, covered in pre-cum, and quivering with the resplendent arousal that Ethan felt across every fiber in his being. If he wanted this to really be as good as his usual cums, he needed to take this slow.<br />
<br />
He gulped as he started teasing his crack, eagerly imagining a woman&#39;s lithe, long finger pushing into his butt. Right before he&#39;d fuck her. He grit his teeth, his fantasies potent today. &quot;Ahh...&quot; Ethan looked down at himself, and slowly wrapped a hand around his cock. He grinned and slowly started pumping. Never did he move too fast, or push himself too far. He was no amateur, he told himself. He&#39;d jacked off enough times to know exactly how far and how fast to go...<br />
<br />
Ethan was adeptly familiar with all his own sensitive spots. So he only pushed as far as he knew he could handle. Pump, pump, pump, pump and pause. Ethan grunted again, he was getting close. Ohh this was gonna take...! At least until he got horny again in 90 minutes or sooner. He made sure as he rubbed again that his eyes were open. That he could see himself.<br />
<br />
Ethan never shot into a sock, or a tissue paper, or a pair of old underwear. He always made sure his legs were ironclad, and then he&#39;d shoot right where he stood. So he could watch himself cum...! Ethan finally finished, touching his sensitive cockhead. He gulped, choking down a long moan, and he felt his sphincter clench as he teased his hole one more time. He could feel it starting...!<br />
<br />
Ethan took on a distinctly satisfied smile as he watched his cock pulse, and then release - all over his stomach, and a bit on his leg and foot. The feeling of release almost overwhelmed him. His muscles flexed and quivered as he shook on his feet. He breathed and said, &quot;Well, if I maybe needed that shower before, I sure do now.&quot; He smirked as he got some towels and prepped for his shower.<br />
<br />
He considered that little performance a test drive for the kind of libido, stamina, intensity and sexual energy that Margie could look forward to.<br />
<br />
As Ethan got into the shower and got the warm water running, he somewhat ironically ended up saying to himself, &quot;I am a fucking animal tonight...&quot; Not even realizing how much of a true statement that would be in just two weeks.</p>
