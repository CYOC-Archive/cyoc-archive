<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd made a mental double-take.  His new life?  He turned from the toilet and unravelled his comically large penis from around his arm, causing it to slap heavily on the floor.  He ignored the wave of sensation he felt from his oversized genitals, too angry with himself for thinking such thoughts.  Why would he allow this to become his new life?  No, he&#39;s going to figure out why this has happened and fix it.<br />
<br />
Todd leaned over, then picked up his massive genitals.  While his testicles were large, they were far from impossible to lift.  Bringing himself back to his room, he set his junk onto the bed, then grabbed his phone.  If this had happened to him, surely Jamie and Marty will have met with a similar fate.  He redialed Jamie&#39;s number, and as the phone rang he looked at his prodigiously large junk.  There was no way he&#39;d be able to have intercourse with a penis this large, assuming he could even get it hard.  Since he had paid attention during sex education, he knew the amount of blood it would require to get an erection would probably cause him to faint from the lack of blood circulating through his brain.  This was his best guess, but he refused to test such a theory.<br />
<br />
The call went to voice mail, which angered Todd.  Jamie may have claimed to still have a hangover, but this was important.  If he wasn&#39;t going to answer Todd by phone, his only remaining choice would be to go to them.  Hopefully Jamie would still be at Marty&#39;s place like his friends had told him the night prior.<br />
<br />
But first, he&#39;d have to figured out a way to get to Marty&#39;s place.  He looked down at his massive testicles.  Perhaps he could hide his penis in a baggy jacket to pass it as belly fat, but these spheres were impossible to conceal with just clothes.  He lifted one of the bloated balls to get a rough idea of the size.  It was indeed the size of a beach ball, but instead of being filled with air, this beast was a solid mass.  Todd was far from weak, having exercised often to keep his place as top dog of the wrestling team, but this mass was still slightly strainful on his muscular arms.  Even if no one noticed him on his way to Marty&#39;s house, he&#39;d probably have to devolve to dragging them or taking multiple breaks along the way.  And more likely, there would be at least one person between his house and Marty&#39;s that&#39;d call the cops as soon as they saw him.<br />
<br />
He wracked his mind for an answer until one came to him.  There was an old wheelbarrow in the backyard he could use, and Todd knew there was still a few spare tarps in the shed.  While it&#39;d look strange of him to carry a load of material with a wheelbarrow from one house to another, it&#39;d be far less concerning than the alternative.  Since his parents weren&#39;t at home, he&#39;d only need to get to his yard without worrying about the path between.<br />
<br />
He readied himself, then hoisted his privates from the bed.  He could have sworn they felt a little heavier than when he&#39;d brought them from his bathroom, but ignored the thought.  His anger had diminished since, and perhaps he hadn&#39;t noticed the weight before.  Going down the stairs was far more perilous than he had imagined.  Keeping both of his testicles in his arms gave virtually no space for movement in the stairwell, and he could see nothing in front of him.  He slowly guided his way down, moving down the staircase at an angle to improve his space problem.<br />
<br />
The trip outside was more or less uneventful.  Todd dropped his balls to get a good idea of where the wheelbarrow was, and was given a rather nasty shock.  His balls made a resounding thud on the grass, and the pain was excruciating, as if he had been struck in the groin.  After blinking away the tears, he picked himself up once again and moved toward the shed to pick up a tarp, then the wheelbarrow.<br />
<br />
His testicles had fit into the wheelbarrow better in his plan than in reality.  Just one testicle was large enough to nearly fill the hand-pushed vehicle, but with some maneuvering both testicles more or less fit.  Todd tucked the tarp enough to hide the visible flesh, leaving some extra material to hang off his side to conceal his direct connection to the load he was carrying.<br />
<br />
All he had to do now was get to Marty&#39;s house.  There, he&#39;d hopefully be able to rally his friends or figure out what they should do next, assuming nothing stops him along the way.</p>
