<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Shit…fuck!” you yell as you went over the edge. You knew instantly that this was going to hurt, a lot. You didn’t know how high the cliff was when you were looking down at the swimming and playing women below but it had to be a good 20 or 40 feet, in truth it was around 50. <br />
<br />
In a small amount of luck for you, it wasn’t a straight drop. In a bad bit of luck, it full of small and not so small rocks. <br />
<br />
You went rolling down the edge, getting small cuts and feeling it as larger rocks smashed against your body with a force which felt like being punched. You ball up covering your head and neck from the worse of it. Even if the rest of your body would be black and blue tomorrow from all the hits if you didn’t end up in a hospital. Everything was going as good as it could be until the final five feet which was a straight drop down into the water. <br />
<br />
Looking back, it was a horrible mistake, but reacting on instinct you stretch out one of your hands to brace your fall only to go crashing into the water. The water was surprising deep considering how the women had been playing in it but still how fast you where going your hand reached the bottom with enough force to break it. You heard the bone break and felt the pain and began to feel the world around you go dark. It was just too much for your body to deal with, but that animal part of your brain told you, you had to get to the surface before you passed out. Holding your arm, your eyes closed from the pain and at the point of passing out you headed back to the surface. Only to feel four or five pairs of arms grabbing you and pulling you up.<br />
<br />
Before you even reached the surface you heard a female voice say.<br />
<br />
“Relax…we got you.” <br />
<br />
You passed out a second or two after you were placed against sold sandy ground, the water coming up to about your chest as you lie on the sand. The animal part of your brain told you, you were out of danger for the moment. <br />
<br />
You don’t know how long you where out, but at some point, you where rolled over to lie on your back, you could feel that.<br />
<br />
“Is that enough?” said a second female voice<br />
<br />
“I think so.” Came a third female voice. “The seaweed and the coral treatment should take care of the wounds….”<br />
<br />
“What about the….” Said a fourth voice as you tried to open your eyes but only got a brief look up at the sky before you had to close them again. “wouldn’t the change cure all his wounds?”<br />
<br />
“Not the broken arm.” Said the third voice as you pass out again into darkness.<br />
<br />
You woke up again in what had to be hours later, you knew this only because you could feel the warmth of the sun on one side of your face as the sun began to set and darkness began to fall. You could still feel the water coming up to about your chest level. You could hear multiple voices coming from around you. <br />
<br />
“I wonder what he is going to become.” Said a female voice from his right.<br />
<br />
“We should find out soon enough.” Answered another as female voice as you let out a groin.<br />
<br />
“I think he is waking up.” Said the female voice as you open your eyes to see what had to be a dozen women all gathered around him with more sitting a little more back watching from a distance. <br />
<br />
All of them where drop dead gorgeous, like 10 out of 10, like you had fallen into a pool full of the top super models and movie stars in the world. They where even better looking then that, their skin looked perfect, their hair seamed perfect and their bodies where perfect. You had fallen into a pool of goddess of all different types and that was no joke. Of the dozen which sat close to you, they had all different hair color and skin color, they where of all different races from around the world and body types. Some had a more muscular build, while some looked like dancers, some had massive breasts while others had smaller breasts but their bodies where perfect for their type. To make it better, some of them where swimming around topless showing off perfect breasts, not all but enough.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” Said one of them, she looked middle eastern, but her hair was colored a lime green color which went well with her color. There where others who had their hair colored as well. “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“Johnna…” you answer semi weakly. <br />
<br />
“Hello Johnna.” Said another woman, this one darker skin African but with felts of gold on her skin and her dark hair braid and tied up in a bun. “We have placed some seaweed on your wounds and put your arm in a sling, just relax and the changes will take over.”<br />
<br />
“Changes…I need to go to a hospital.” You answer before you notice that the women were sitting in water which should have been too deep to sit in for long. You focus on some of the women who were sitting a little bit off, that is when you noticed. From the waste down they didn’t have legs. They had fish tails; they were mermaids. <br />
<br />
There where multiple different tails from what he saw, some where the classic tails you had seen in movies, others had shark like tails, others eel like, one looked like an octopus tail and was that a squid or something tail. They came in all different colors; some had sold scale colors while others looked as colorful as a tropical fish. <br />
<br />
“I see you noticed.” Said the women/mermaid with long black hair in curly locks and pale skin. “We are mermaids, and you feel into magical waters, you are about to change to join us in the sea.”<br />
<br />
“I wonder what he will change into?” Said a mermaid with honey brown hair <br />
<br />
“Could be anything.” answered another “Others who had fallen in have changed race, gender and even age. There was once a male human body builder who became a mermaid baby.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes widen as you look down.</p>
