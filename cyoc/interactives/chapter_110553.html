<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You should be ashamed of yourself,&quot; a woman who practically screamed &#39;stereotypical soccer mom&#39; declared as she barged through the door and marched up to the Old Man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, but what specifically are we talking about?&quot; the Old Man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peddling your demonic wares where children could find them. I ought to-&quot; the woman started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop. Please, allow me to explain.&quot; the Old Man began, &quot;Actually, no. You&#39;re annoying me. I usually hate to cast directly on customers, but I&#39;ll make an exception.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman was frozen in place, save her eyes darting back and forth. Before she could process what was going on, she felt cold blowing against her legs, as if she were wearing a skirt instead of her knee-length dress. Then her chest felt heavy, and if she weren&#39;t trapped in place, she would have keeled over. Within a few moments, she could move again, and was able to see what had happened.<br />
<br />
Her clothes had changed from a dress and a sweater over it to a cropped tank top and short shorts. The weight on her chest was due to the fact that her breasts had exploded from her previous B cup to an outrageous size she couldn&#39;t even guess at. When she motioned with her arms to prod at the massive flesh on her chest, she instead began fondling herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; she asked in a calm, dulcet tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made you more sinful. I thought it would be funny.&quot; the Old Man said, shrugging, &quot;Basic rundown: your breasts are O cups, as you&#39;ve noticed. Whenever someone near you is thinking about you in a dirty way, you&#39;ll fondle yourself. If they&#39;re jerking off to you, you&#39;ll masturbate as well. Any clothes you own or ever will own will magically become incredibly revealing. You also can&#39;t speak in anything other than a sultry seductive tone. Fortunately, I&#39;ve thrown in a bonus where you don&#39;t get back pain from your colossal mounds, and everyone will not only think you were always like this, they won&#39;t even think the stimulating yourself bit is anything other than normal. Now, if I were you, I would buy something before the magic man decided to go further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; she said, still fondling herself with one hand as she grabbed her wallet out of her purse, &quot;what do you want me to get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; the Old Man said, pulling the Card Game of Change out and setting it on the counter, &quot;For the kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know?&quot; the woman started to say. Considering everything that had happened to her in the last few minutes, she decided she knew the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a nice day ma&#39;am,&quot; the Old Man said, grinning as he took the fifteen dollars from the woman and ushered her out the door.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Kathleen had no idea why she was actually handing the devil game to her son for the youth group event at her house. She also didn&#39;t know why she was flouncing around at that event in a mostly transparent nightie and pinching her nipples as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks mom. There&#39;s only seven of us tonight, and that includes Ms. Sara, so this&#39;ll really help pass the time,&quot; Jonny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no need to thank me dear. Just have fun,&quot; Kathleen said with a wink as she turned to go up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom is so nice,&quot; Kiki said. Kiki was one of the older kids in the group, and definitely showed it. She stood at 5&#39;10&quot;, but was basically a string bean. She was mostly there so the pastor would like her and say good things about her if she put him down as a reference on her resume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. And she makes a great shake,&quot; Bart said, sipping his milkshake and wiggling his eyebrows at anyone he could. Bart wasn&#39;t actually in the youth group, but he was one of Johnny&#39;s friends and had nothing better to do for the night, so he came for the free food. He was also the youngest person there at only 15, and his belly definitely showed the effects of his quest for food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it was very nice of her to make us all dinner,&quot; Sara said. Sara was the adult beside Kathleen, since the church wasn&#39;t sure they wanted three teenaged boys alone with Kathleen, even if one of them was her son. Sara looked and acted like a Disney princess, from the long blond hair to the thin everything to her love for small animals.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are we doing something, or is the box just for show?&quot; Dixie asked. Dixie was the preacher&#39;s daughter, and the person who wanted to be there the least. She had made a reputation as that kind of preacher&#39;s daughter ever since she had her licence revoked two weeks after getting it. Since that was only a month ago, she didn&#39;t have much choice but to hang out at the youth group. Of course, showing off her modest cleavage and gorgeous good looks didn&#39;t hurt either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, as much as I like your mom&#39;s cooking, I don&#39;t think we can fill the whole evening with it,&quot; Chad said. Chad was the only football player in the youth group, and he made sure no one forgot it with his almost skin-tight jersey. Regardless of what he may have said, he would have been perfectly content to watch Kiki and Dixie over dinner for a few hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop houndin&#39; the poor guy and let him talk,&quot; Natasha said. Natasha was 17, same as Chad and Kiki, but unlike Kiki, Natasha looked more like she was 14. She was just under five feet tall, and thanks to her bright red hair, had been dubbed a leprechaun by a few people. When those people lost their teeth, most stopped calling her that. Natasha had just moved from Ireland, which didn&#39;t help with the leprechaun thing, and was using the group as a way to meet people.<br />
<br />
Johnny stood up to speak. He was about as average as a guy could look. Not too scrawny, but not fit. Dirty brown hair, but not too dirty. He was the kind of guy where if he stepped into a crowd, he was basically invisible, &quot;This is a game my mom picked up. It&#39;s called the Game of Change. It&#39;s a card game about going out and fighting monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we play the game?&quot; Kiki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each player gets four cards from the event deck and two cards from the treasure deck.&quot; Johnny said as Sara dealt the cards, &quot;Then we turn over cards from the event deck to make our way through the game until we find the boss at the end. It says that whoever defeats him gets a wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A wish? What kind of game did your mom get, exactly?&quot; Chad asked, holding back a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kind where we fight demons and monsters and restore goodness and ponies and yay,&quot; Dixie said, leaning back in her chair with so much force that she nearly knocked herself over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, I trust Mrs. Kathleen. If she wasn&#39;t on the straight and narrow, we wouldn&#39;t be here, right?&quot; Bart said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be here no matter what. You only came for the food,&quot; Kiki pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the food is good enough that I trust Mrs. Kathleen,&quot; Bart said as he stuffed a roll in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It also says here that to start, we have to say a specific prayer in Latin,&quot; Johnny said. Whether or not the rules referred to it as a prayer before Johnny started reading was between the Old Man and God. And their third poker buddy, Elvis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know. I&#39;ll do it,&quot; Natasha said as Dixie opened her mouth. Natasha&#39;s family had been Catholic before the move, and Dixie knew that anything related to the idea was a sore spot for Natasha. Dixie didn&#39;t say anything, but did have an extremely satisfied grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s do this. O Domine, hic sit amet. Estote parati, quia magnus mutatio et haedos,&quot; Natasha read.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it mean?&quot; Chad asked. Just then, a bright light filled the room. Before anyone, which of course means Dixie, could say a word, the light disappeared, and the players all went with it.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Kathleen sat straight up in bed. She wasn&#39;t groping herself anymore. Whichever kids downstairs had been thinking of her like a pervert had stopped. Before she could do much to celebrate, the family dog, Moses, walked in. He looked up at Kathleen and her now swinging breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you actual son of a bitch. Which means it isn&#39;t swearing.&quot; Kathleen said as she started playing with herself again, &quot;I am &#39;&#39;so&#39;&#39; having you neutered.&quot;</p>
