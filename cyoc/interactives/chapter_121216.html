<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden frowned, but he couldn&#39;t deny that the costume had made him curious.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” he said, face red and eyes averted in embarrassment. “Let me just try it on. Just for a moment.” It would satisfy his curiosity and then he could just take it off and leave. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper was more than happy to show him to the changing room and telling Aiden to call if he needed any help. Aiden made sure the curtains were properly drawn before he began to strip. He couldn&#39;t believe he was going to put on something so embarrassing. As long as no one saw him in it, it&#39;d be fine.<br />
<br />
His heart raced as he first slipped on the chastity belt before he had a chance to get too excited and not be able to. Even flaccid, he wondered if he&#39;d even be able to force it on. It looked so small. It was a rather odd looking chastity belt. Most chastity belts came in multiple parts that had to be locked together around the cock and balls. But this was just a small metal sleeve. Or at least he thought it was metal. It was hard, but something about it just felt... alive. Aiden slid it over his dick, wondering how it was supposed to fasten in place, but too his surprise, as soon as the tip of his dick entered it, the chastity belt flew into place onto him as if it was a starving and the penis was its dinner.<br />
<br />
Aiden gasped as the chastity belt forced his penis smaller and smaller as it practically sucked its way further and further onto his dick. Forcing the dick more and more down between his legs like a submissive puppy&#39;s tail. It didn&#39;t stop until there was no possible way it could get any further on. Right down the bace of his dick, right up against his pelvis. And for a moment, Aiden thought he felt some kind of subtle tongue wetly lick the end of his dick. But that was absurd. There was no space left in there for anything else. He was surprised that even his dick had fit. It was so tight.<br />
<br />
Experimentally, Aiden pulled a bit on it, but the chastity belt didn&#39;t come off. It didn&#39;t even budge. Even the simple task of getting it to point a bit up from between his legs was impossible. There was definitely something strange going on. Aiden resigned himself to the humiliating task of having to ask the shopkeeper afterwords on how to get it off. But for now, he&#39;d enjoy the helpless situation his dick was in. Frustrating and tight as it was, it was quite a thrill too. As long as he knew he didn&#39;t have to keep it on for too long. He might have gone crazy not being able to masterbate after this. He was getting really turned on.<br />
<br />
As he moved his hands away from it, he noticed that his pubic hair brushed away too. Shocked, Aiden stroked his pubic area and the hair just fell off like it had never been attached, leaving him completely smooth. Not even a stable left. And so soft and sensitive. It was perfect for the lingerie he slid on over. Aiden hadn&#39;t thought the girly lingerie would fit on him, but with his penis tucked so snuggly away, it made him look like he didn&#39;t even have anything to speak of under there.<br />
<br />
Next he slid on the stalkings and boots, which came in once piece and forced him to stand on tip toe. Now maybe he&#39;d be almost as tall as the average person, being so short to begin with. The stalkings came all the way up to his thighs and fit perfectly. And again, the hair on his legs this time, fell off him with ease.<br />
<br />
Now for the lace mask with cat ears. They fit perfectly on him and made him look absolutely adorable in the mirror. Like the chastity device, the mask didn&#39;t seem to have any straps or anything to hold it onto him, yet it stayed on as well as if it were tattooed onto his face. And when Aiden felt the cat ears that stuck up he shuttered with the sensation. It felt like they were his ears. Real ears. And when he looked into the mirror again, he saw that his eyes were slanted and in two different colors. One blue and the other yellowy-brown.<br />
<br />
He wondered if maybe he should stop this, but he was too excited to give up just yet. He picked up the butt-plug with the tail and looked around for some lube to use. Finding none, he settled for simply licking it until it was nice and wet. It didn&#39;t look too big, so he didn&#39;t think there would be too much of a problem.<br />
<br />
As the butt-plug slid in place, Aiden felt the feline tail flick as if it were alive. Then the butt-plug inside him seemed to grow and push against his prostate. Frightened, Aiden tried to pull it loose, but it was stuck in place. It sent shivers down his spine as it filled him up. Aiden stumbled in his tip-toe shoes and every step caused the butt-plug to rub against his prostate. He felt around the tail and discovered that despite how big it felt inside him, he could easily fit something else in with it if he wanted.<br />
<br />
The costume was clearly more than met the eye, but it was almost all done now. Aiden slipped on a cute collar with a bell on it, which unsurprisingly also adjusted itself to fit perfectly around Aiden&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Last was the mittens. They trapped his fingers into useless paws and matching the stalkings, rode all the way up his arms almost to his shoulders, removing all hair as they were pulled on. And like everything else, they were stuck in place. He couldn&#39;t take them off.<br />
<br />
Aiden was excited as he looked at is kitty self. So cute yet so sexy. His entire upper body was completely exposed, and everything else was beyond skimpy and might as well have been painted on for all it hid. He almost wanted someone to play with him like this, but that would be way too embarrassing. Fun was fun, but now he had to figure out how to take this off. He pulled back the curtains to embarrassingly ask for help to remove the costume.</p>
