<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another of the sites that Kelly Crauss decided to ship the Muscle Tech-X to on order - with far less organized dosage restriction - was the Iron Body Show out in California, near the bay area. The Iron Body show was just one of many bodybuilding shows in the state that more or less made the sport what it was. Many people started there before making their way back up toward the major bodybuilding shows. Some of the athletes that went there were in full physique shape, others were still diligently at work, and building up their credentials and knowledge of the field.<br />
<br />
And given the effects of Muscle Tech-X and how it tended to interact with the body, as well as its effects, she figured that there might be some interesting effects on the muscle-heads who called the place home at this time. <br />
<br />
The event itself was being held in a massive convention hall, with numerous rooms where the evaluation, registration, and other events were being held. Besides the bodybuilding events themselves, there were a number of &quot;test your strength&quot; style events going on. From pull up bars set up with a reward for the one who managed to do the most pull-ups, to a similar bench press set up, a few squat racks, and even a few places for learning posing, it was pretty clear this was all expenses cleared.<br />
<br />
There were even places for application of spray tan for the stage, and a couple tutorials to help younger bodybuilders get themselves ready in case they needed to do some more upkeep before going on stage or registering.<br />
<br />
Little did any of them know the effects of some of the refreshments.<br />
<br />
Muscle Tech-X was available at a small concession stand near the entrance, back toward one of the classic physique shows, and then near the pull up bars. The stands were manned by only a couple poorly informed interns - told that the recommendation was just one dosage, but that it was hardly a definite rule. Such was the set up for quite an eventful Iron Body show that year...<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Ethan Wayne Shelton looked out the window of the passenger side on the car door as he and his friends arrived at the Iron Body show. <br />
<br />
Ethan was a six foot even young man who had developed a passion for bodybuilding ever since 12 years old when he watched an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. And as of now, at age 19, he was very proud of how far he&#39;d gone. He relied on spray tan to get all golden for the stage, being that he tended to burn if he tried to lay out and tan, being naturally kind of pale. He had light brown hair, hazel colored eyes, and an incredibly well toned though not entirely massive physique. His arms crested at 17 inches, striated and defined. His triceps made the classic horseshoe look, and many of his shirts strained at his powerfully built pecs, shoulders and trapezius. His abdominals were a little weak compared to the tone on the rest of him, and getting to that six pack was a struggle. Though he liked to think his obliques made up for it. His glutes were very well defined, and his quads likewise, though his thighs slightly lagged. His calves were diamond-like, often rubbing against his pants&#39; legs.<br />
<br />
As of now, Ethan wore an extra large stringer shirt that scooped down just below his broad pectorals, the strings only just covering his nipples. Most of his back&#39;s skin showed. Under his heavy workout pants, he wore a very showy little posing pouch - his girlfriend loved it when he just wore his pouch at the apartment when she was around. Said it made him look very sexualized. And she always made it really worth his while.<br />
<br />
Also in the car, sitting just behind Ethan and drinking a Mountain Dew, was the darker haired brunette Calvin or &quot;Cal&quot; Shelton, Ethan&#39;s younger brother by a year.<br />
<br />
If Ethan was mostly tone, Cal was by and large <i>size</i>. His eyes were slightly darker, his skin tone a bit more naturally tan, but his issue seemed to be the opposite to his brother&#39;s. Where Ethan lacked size, Cal exulted in it. However it was very distinctly evident that Cal went a little too far - he had to flex really, really hard just to show ANY abdominal development. Cal however was indeed massive - which he enjoyed significantly. <br />
<br />
And whereas Ethan largely tended to be more cerebral though not entirely withdrawn, Cal was unapologetically &quot;the jock brother&quot;. Ironically however, Cal got his start in bodybuilding largely because he was inspired by his older brother&#39;s fitness. Before Ethan was 12, Cal wasn&#39;t even involved in any sports or fitness at all!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro, looks like we&#39;re here...&quot; Ethan said with a smile as they got out, &quot;You excited?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To kick your ass on stage, sure am!&quot; Cal chuckled and elbowed his brother before locking his arm around Ethan&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Man we have gotta see the sights. I&#39;ll bet there&#39;ll be a bunch of fitness babes here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;ll be all over my dick instead of yours...&quot; Ethan teased, &quot;Babes prefer a <i>cut</i> man over a mass monster. Besides, I happen to be able to describe my workout circuit and dietary plan, whereas you&#39;re firmly in the camp of &quot;I eat stuff and drink stuff and I do stuff&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bull-fucking-shit, bro. You know babes prefer a big man...&quot; Cal flexed his bicep, displaying his larger arms, &quot;I got two and a half inches on you, man, and it&#39;ll show. &#39;Sides, I think we all know who has the best chances here. I&#39;m the handsome brother, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan shrugged and chuckled, &quot;Whatever you say, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
The driver walked around from his end and said, &quot;So just so we&#39;re clear...there ARE gonna be hot fitness babes here, right?&quot; Clay Lambert was a jock friend of Cal&#39;s, and a would-be playboy type. His straw blond hair, light blue eyes, and tan all gave him the Cali Surfer vibe, and his muscular physique was, rather than honed in the gym, made through surfing, playing football and training for it, and various other physical sports like rock-climbing, swimming, and even some wrestling. Clay loved to flirt and play around, and he was a natural fit with Cal.<br />
<br />
Then out came Beau James, a young, somewhat metrosexual and well honed and toned up black guy, hair cut down to a stylish buzz cut, his handsome features constantly moisturized and treated. Few guys cared as much about their looks as Beau did, though he just as well applied that to his physique. Though not exactly a bodybuilder, he had the sort of form that was well suited to the aesthetic of vanity and the constant appreciation of his physique. Standing about six foot and a half an inch tall, Beau seemed pretty interested in some of the other aspects to this.<br />
<br />
He stated, &quot;Me personally I&#39;m interested in seeing some of the manscaping, tanning, and personal upkeep places. See if there&#39;s anything I can do for my personal appearance.&quot; Beau of course shot his reflection an appreciative grin and gave a flex. His outfit was a bright blue short sleeved shirt, a vest over that, tight light blue jeans, and dress shoes. As always, stylish and given to nice clothes. Beau currently had a well paying job with a fashion magazine. It was considered a somewhat open secret he and some of the female models often hooked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bodybuilding guys always confuse me...why take this stuff so seriously?&quot; Nick Rhodes stepped out last. He was a willowy dark haired stoner type, relaxed and at ease. He was also despite the reputation stoners had the expert on technology. Hearing him sleepily describe in perfect, accurate detail how a certain tech item could be fixed, updated, maintained or otherwise enhanced was a rather...surreal experience. But then he didn&#39;t exactly fit perfectly into any preconception.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just see it as art,&quot; Ethan said, explaining a bit, &quot;It&#39;s like my body...is art. And going on stage is exhibiting that art.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t make it any less weird seeing you in a posing pouch, dude.&quot; Clay commented.<br />
<br />
Beau chuckled, &quot;Oh, if you think that&#39;s showy, you should see some of the outfits certain Scenes wear.&quot; Admittedly, Beau thought as they walked, he almost felt kind of jealous of Ethan strutting his stuff up there. <i>God, what an ass. Flaunting it up there on stage, fuck...and here I thought I was mostly straight! I...guess there&#39;s the &quot;mostly&quot; part.</i> Beau started walking differently to make it less obvious he was boning up pretty significantly.<br />
<br />
Before long, there was a significant enough crowd to force the group to come to less of a significant pace. Clay failed to stop in time as he tried to scope out some fitness babes - and in the process he ran right into Ethan.<br />
<br />
Ethan almost jumped and choked down a noise as he felt Clay and his more or less whole upper body and groin press up against Ethan&#39;s back and ass. Clay for his part muttered his utterly typical jock &quot;no homo&quot; remarks (even as he registered to his mortification that he could appreciate how thick and toned Ethan was), all the while Beau silently pondered that - and wondered if he might be able to accidentally run into Ethan next. Or just enjoy the very obviously fit and attractive babes here - either one worked for Beau right now.<br />
<br />
Nick chuckled, &quot;Typical jock Clay - does something soooo gay, and then backpedals like a coward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Fuck off, Rhodes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal remarked, &quot;Dude, if you go on about it it just seems, y&#39;know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan for his part barely even noticed due to seeing someone he&#39;d been hoping to see there. Amazing what being starstruck can let you just stand around right through. Bart Ruiz, one of the major bodybuilders that Ethan followed on IG. Easily 250 lbs and a big contender this year for the serious contests here. Half Hispanic, Bart Ruiz had thick, luscious combed back hair, a completely clean-shaven, handsome look, and still looked every bit as vital as he always did even at 42. Most thought he barely looked 25! As of now he wore a black button up shirt, tight black dress pants, and dress shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Bart Ruiz...&quot; Ethan felt a sense of &quot;meeting your celebrities&quot; style excitement. Even though he was definitely a straight man, he couldn&#39;t deny Bart was even more stunningly attractive in person. And he was it seemed evaluating some refreshment stand that was sitting out there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it seems I have some fans!&quot; Bart smiled broadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t ya go kiss him?&quot; Cal whispered to Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh shut up, Cal.&quot; Ethan whispered back fiercely before stepping forward, &quot;Yeah! Yeah! You really inspired me to do my bodybuilding more seriously, and your guide to the first shred helped out a lot.&quot; Ethan looked at the refreshment, &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s something called Muscle Tech-X,&quot; Bart stated, tilting his head at line of drinks on the stand, &quot;Dunno how accurate these claims are. But they&#39;re pretty radical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really...?&quot; Clay stepped forward, and checked out the sign, &quot;Instant muscular action, to various degrees, but always demonstrable...&quot; Clay crossed his arms. &quot;Really. This stuff seems pretty ballsy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna try it, son?&quot; Bart said with a smile. Ethan, Beau, Cal, Clay and even Nick glanced at it with curiosity. They started contemplating about whether they wanted to try it - Ethan needed a boost for his amateur bodybuilding show, Cal was always in the mood for more size, Clay just wanted to know if it would work, Beau was thinking he might need some more muscle in some places seeing some of these guys here, while Nick was feeling kind of curious...</p>
