<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marina found San Francisco to be relatively quiet and comfortable as far as big cities went. Sure it was busier and noisier than Animalia and Lyre, even on a &quot;quiet&quot; day, but she had found it a good place to live and a fairly decent place to live and work. Dealing with the smoke from the northern California fires was tough and both Marina and Bennie expected their taxes to be much higher despite the present administration&#39;s claim of a tax cut, as California was a relatively high tax state to begin with, but the job that she and Bennie had was a good one. It helped the company provide education on marine life to those that weren&#39;t aware on it and offered means of health and rehabilitation of marine animals that might need it. In this, they&#39;d frequently worked with various shelters and other groups that sought to help all animals, and Marina had a great deal of pride in that.<br />
<br />
Especially as she looked into the small crib that she and Bennie had set up to watch their infant child peacefully sleep while snuggled in black and white blankets that seemed to be stitched to match the black and white patterns that the Orca was known for. They were a gift from one of their co-workers who had been most helpful for her and Bennie. And while some things may have been a bit silly, Mariana couldn&#39;t help but feel that there was real friendship there...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think our children will understand how Orca our colored, Rikki,&quot; Marina said to the young woman that sat opposite her and Bennie at the small  birth party that was prepared for them.<br />
<br />
The party was a small one, and came outside of the plans that she and Bennie had with regard to meeting with friends in Animalia and Lyre later, but it also fit with pans that related to the fact that Rikki had been quite friendly with them in San Francisco.  Some of it had also reflected thoughts that Marina and Bennie had that Rikki was also something of a huge &quot;Free Willy&quot; fan, but it wasn&#39;t too bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sire...&quot; Rikki gave a small chuckle, &quot;but it&#39;ll be fun and cute. Don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rikki then smiles as she held up the most soft square blanket that a black and white color tone that mirrored the pattern that matched the design that Orcas normally had and what Marina, herself, had had before she was uplifted. To some extent it was a nice pattern, but it wasn&#39;t quite what Mariana was felt was needed at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;For some, maybe...&quot; Marina began and glanced to Bennie while looking for some support. However she saw Rikki&#39;s lips go from a hopeful smile to a nervous frown. That soon changed things and Marina soon changed her comment, &quot;though... I suppose we could try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And Marina did keep the blanket, partially because Rikki had been a good friend and had helped both Marina and Bennie when it came to things like moving their voter registration from Animalia/Lyre, Nevada to San Francisco, California. Rikki also went swimming with Marina and Bennie when they had days off. Both of them were actually quite impressed by Rikki&#39;s tolerance for things, as the waters around San Francisco were colder than those around Los Angeles. Marina and Bennie had some means of protection against cold water, via a thin layer of blubber that seemed quite effective for them, but Rikki often had to go without that, but she still went with Bennie and Marina when they had days off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to come in if it&#39;s too cold,&quot; Bennie commented he and Marina walked toward one of the areas around San Francisco that did allow for public swimming.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not too bad,&quot; Rikki insisted, &quot;and you guys are friends. I don&#39;t we&#39;ve ever had workers who&#39;ve had scientific knowledge and first hand knowledge and have been so fun to hang out with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of your coworkers before Bennie and me weren&#39;t Animalians,&quot; Marina said with a smile and patted Rikki shoulder, and then feeling a bit of a kick in her womb which presently swelled in front of the female Orca Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps not... but what you isn&#39;t why you&#39;re friends to me... it&#39;s more WHO you are,&quot; Rikki commented and then gave a small shrug, &quot;Most people I&#39;ve met just remark that I&#39;m passionate about marine life and leave it at that... and I&#39;ll admit there are some things I may go over the top with... but it&#39;s all part of why I started working with the firm we&#39;re at in the first place. Teaching people about life in the sea and caring for animals that need it... be it a while injured by a ship&#39;s propeller or sick from oil or pollution... or being beached. That&#39;s important, and I&#39;ve always had fun doing it. You two... you seem to have same love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rikki then came up between Bennie and Mariana hopped up to hug both of them, which sort of pulled them all together.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re all family I never had...&quot;Rikki said happily.<br />
<br />
Mariana did smile at that, as while there were some times when Rikki could be &quot;odd,&quot; but Rikki had always been friendly and supportive. Both she and Bennie liked that. She did return the hug that Rikki offered with a small smile. However, biology soon took precedent over the plan for a swim as Mariana was forced to give a groan of pain that originated in her core and went through her entire body.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And Rikki was there for you while you were in labor,&quot; Mariana heard a male voice speak from behind her, making her turn to see Bennie come up behind her.<br />
<br />
Mariana smiled and nodded to him. With the birth of their calf, she had gotten some maternity leave and she was glad for that as Bennie approached her. Though, Mariana was also quite happy to show their calf to their friends in Lyre/Animalia for a visit closer to January 1, and she was also happy to let Rikki continue to be a sort of godmother to the newborn. For the woman was a good friend and had been there for Mariana&#39;s time in labor just as much as Bennie was, and that was a good thing. Though by now with those responsibilities there was also expectation that eventually Mariana would be expected to return to work and by that time that might mean some shifting for both her and Bennie&#39;s schedules to allow for them to be able to be there for their child and to work as well.</p>
