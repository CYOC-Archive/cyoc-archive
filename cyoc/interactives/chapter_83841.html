<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake&#39;s shorter than usual walk across campus to his dorm room gave him enough time to think about his first wish, the only thing was that about ten seconds after his first wish, he started thinking with his other head. Locking the door behind him, he set the lamp down on his desk and sat across from it on his chair, thinking about how much he could change himself for personal amusement and pleasure with a wish. Excited at the thought, he grabbed the lamp and looked down at his crotch, rehearsing what he was about to say one last time before rubbing the lamp. Beldazarr immediately sprung forth from the lamp&#39;s fog and asked, &quot;You summoned me, master? What is your wish?&quot; Drake&#39;s penis throbbed at the next thought. &quot;I wish to have larger testicles, for my penis, I want it to grow to the size of a stallion&#39;s, and my balls to be as large and fertile as a bull in it&#39;s prime during mating season. But, I don&#39;t want the transformation to hurt, and I&#39;ll grow the necessary muscle and blood to support my extra weight.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve thought about this haven&#39;t you? Very specific. Now it is done.&quot; the genie said. Already erect, a tingling sensation went straight from Drake&#39;s crotch to his head, flooding it with endorphins. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you to your pleasure master.&quot; Beldazarr said, retreating into the lamp. <br />
The moment the genie was gone, Drake ripped off his pants and underwear to watch as his cock and balls grew. The inches tacked on to his shaft as it dropped halfway down his leg and kept growing. His balls went from fitting into his palm to golf balls, to baseballs, to watermelons. Gripping his shaft, the girth widened in his hands, he couldn&#39;t even wrap one hand around it even if he squeezed. Finally his shaft stopped past his knees while widening so far that his fingertips couldn&#39;t touch if he put both hands around it. Drake felt his abs harden and legs grow firmer to support the extra weight, he could even see it too as his supporting muscles became more defined. Feeling sperm surge through his new balls and blood rush to his stallion sized cock, he was beyond erect and leaking precum. <br />
&#39;This was definitely the right wish.&#39; he thought to himself, slowly stroking all the way down from the base of his cock to the head with one hand. Groping his balls with the other, it was hard not to speed up, but no, he had more self control than that, at least for now. He thought this wish through didn&#39;t he? Now, he&#39;s going to enjoy it. Laying down on his bed, feeling the weight of his testicles sink into him and his bed only made him that much more erect to play with. Going a little faster, he grabbed his cock with both hands and stroked faster, rubbing the tip with his right hand to feel the sensation of cumming creep up on him a little more quickly. Bending the cock down towards him, he shuddered as he knew the moment was getting undeniably closer. Rubbing faster, his cock wanted to shoot upright and explode, but now Drake had to force his penis down to stroke even faster until finally he opened his eyes and felt his balls dump massive amounts of cum into his shaft. Now, full throttle, he gripped tight with both hands and felt the load explode upwards and shake his whole body with wave after wave of pleasure. Cum rained down onto his chest, balls, legs, and bed but his orgasm was nowhere close to being finished yet. His mind filled with euphoria as he laid back, letting his arms drop to his side as cock still poured out cum.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, his thoughts were slowly reconnecting as to the mind blowing orgasm he just achieved. He couldn&#39;t even tell how much time passed, but Drake didn&#39;t care if the whole day passed while something like that occurred. His penis was still hard as a rock, but slowly sinking down towards his chest and straight for his lips. He didn&#39;t even think twice as to what to do next. Without even craning his neck, Drake pulled the shaft into his mouth and licked the tip clean, feeling the head with his tongue, he slipped his tongue into the urethra and swallowed whatever was there. His balls expanded again, knowing what was coming as he slowly let his dick travel to the back of his mouth and down his throat. Stroking, pulling, sucking, Drake felt like cumming much more quickly than before without petty things like self restraint holding him back. Feeling the cum travel up his shaft, down the throat, and into the stomach, he let the pleasure overtake him as it came in one massive flood like before. <br />
Cumming several more times before he was finally able to sit upright in a haze and realize he needed to take a breather from aggressively jerking off for hours on end. &#39;This is the first time I&#39;ve had a single thought since the second wish...&#39; he said to himself. Standing upright and looking towards the bathroom, it felt like the right time to take a shower. It also seemed like a pretty good place to do it again without much needing much effort in the clean up because he sure wasn&#39;t sleeping in those sheets tonight.</p>
